In there they allow themselves and "third parties" to mine your data in a lot of ways. They also allow themselves to change it again whenever they want. If you don't agree, you lose access to your tables and can't play anymore. That's absolutely unacceptable behavior in my opinion.\n\nIntroducing an EULA after the fact is unacceptable on its own without offering a full refund since I couldn't have known about the new EULA when I bought the tables. But then even adding such privacy violating terms that's the last straw.\n\nAnd they closed a thread in the forums here, where it was discussed with no good reason at all.\n\nAll in all I'm disgusted by their behavior and I therefore regret the money I put into this game. If I had known what I know now, I wouldn't have bought any of the tables.\n\nEDIT 05.07.2015: They promised a revised EULA. Nothing happened. We have been waiting since May 12, 2015 now. That's when the new EULA was introduced. So we have been waiting for almost 8 weeks now to play the game we paid (a lot of) money for. And the only thing that happens is they lock threads where this is talked about.\n\nMy advice would be to ask for a refund for every table now. It's been long enough waiting for them to resolve this, they had plenty of time and did nothing. Changing the EULA after the fact should be reason enough to get a refund even if you have played the game for more than 2 hours before the EULA change.\n\nEDIT 15.08.2015: As of today, more than 3 months after the newly introduced EULA, nothing  substantial has changed. I'm still locked out of the game I purchased (through DLC, game itself is marketed as F2P) without having to agree to any EULA at all and still can't play without accepting one now which still has questionable parts I don't want to agree to.\nAgain we're promised major changes for the better in the forum and there's a discussion about that existing customers shouldn't have seen the new EULA pop up at all. But we have. And we can't play without accepting it.\nWell, we'll see where it all leads, but in any case, it's been more than THREE MONTHS without a solution which says a lot in my opinion. I would still like to see a good solution though, obviously, which should be: Anyone who bought the game (which essentially means DLC for the game) before they introduced the new EULA (any EULA at all) should be able to play the game without the enforcement of said EULA. Any new buyers should at least be shown the EULA BEFORE they buy/download the game. I have no idea how they would do that technically, distinguishing these two types of players ingame, however. So even better: Drop that EULA crap completely, like almost every other game does.\n\nEdit 17.09.2015: Still no update, although they promised again and again. Instead they locked the "New EULA" thread again. Why? Because in there they were called again on their let's name it "misbehaviour", you all know what I would rather name it, but I'll try to be civil here although they aren't. The Community Manager for Zen Studios Barbie Bob-omb says it's locked because of arguing (which is exactly what that thread and a forum is for) and to avoid banning, so clearly threatens to ban (without a good reason). Clearly the real reason is to have that thread disappear on the second page again. It's not the first time they did it (see above). They even ban people for voicing their  opinion.\n\nSo we are at 4 ( in words: four ! ) months waiting time for them to solve this now. I'm starting to miss the right words to express how disgusted I am about their behaviour in this whole matter. That includes their forum moderation.\n\nOne thing's for sure, whatever they do now, I will avoid them like the plague in the future. They will never see another cent from me. I know that's not helping to motivate them to solve this, but I'm just done with them. I've never seen a developer/publisher treat their customers with that much disrespect over such a long time. And I've seen a lot of crap in that regard.\n\nEDIT: 02.10.2015: One last edit. After 4.5 months they finally admitted that the new EULA is here to stay even for existing customers. So I won't be able to play this game ever again although it was paid a lot of money for. I don't have to tell you how much that sucks.\n\nI recommend everyone to ask Steam for a refund. If you refer to the new EULA, where there wasn't one when you bought the game, in your request for a refund, Steam should approve your request even though you probably played a lot longer than two hours. Unfortunately I got all my tables as gifts and Steam doesn't do refunds for gifts, so I can't ask for one. Otherwise I would have done so months ago and not wasted so much time trying to debate with this rotten developer.","June 3, 2015","false","4.0"," 158 of 187 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","158","187","5","23"

The reason is that I had 'better' things to do at the arcade: Space Invaders, Asteroids, Galaga, Paperboy, Double Dragon, etc. were all more important to me than pinball.  But this game has me wishing that wasn't the case! In fact, if I had a time machine I would go back and try all of those tables in real life!\n\nI know I haven't said much about the game itself, and I'm not going to either.  The truth is I don't even know much about pinball.  I'll just give you a couple reasons why I think this game is such a success to me:\n\n--each table feels genuinely different which adds to replayability\n\n--the leaderboard system is great: it got me to add friends for chasing high scores and I've also been telling family members to try this out--there's nothing like beating your sister or cousin or even long lost uncle!\n\n--everyone gets a free table, which is a pretty good one in and of itself (just try it!)\n\n--love the sound bytes (especially for Star Wars tables) as they really add to the overall atmosphere\n\n--it's still fun even if your not very good at it (like me)\n\n--it got me to write this review\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","113.0"," 135 of 167 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","135","167","0","6"

Which is why every paid customer's score on every table upto September 2015 since launch has been relegated to a frozen "archive."\n\nIf you are interested, you can see for yourself how this policy came about, and what kind of person initiated it for what motive, in this thread.\n\nAlso, there have been many occasion of savegame wipes without notice, despite players' advice to the contrary.  It's painfully obvious Zen doesn't respect nor value your time and effort invested in their game.

Zen Studios just doesn't listen at all to the community and is by now just a simple money making machine, going for lucrative license projects.

No, wait, I'm thinking of Tommy.  Either way, pinball has been an important part of my life whenever it has been.  Time marches on though, and you can't just go play pinball like you used to.  Down at the local hangout, by the soda fountain, with flippers flipping, balls always bouncing, to the left and to the right, lights flashing, eplileptic kids flailing about on the floor, those days, back then, they're gone.\n\nAll is not lost though.  Pinball FX2 is here to fill that void left by the demise of the pinball machine with software pinball that surpasses the original in every way except for those it does not.  When it comes down to it, what you really lose is having an actual pinball table in front of you.  You can never recreate that exact feel, the solid wood gripped firmly in your hands as you aim for ever higher scores while deftly avoiding the flailing epileptic kids.\n\nThat's just the way it has to be though, and there are plenty of good things about virtual pinball that makes it well worth a play.  The tables can be more elaborate than a real pinball table ever could, and they certainly are lovely to look at.  Any pinball table you want is right there on your television, no need for a huge arcade to house all of your games.  Heck, with a wireless xbox controller, you even get some vibration when you shake the table.\n\nIf you loved pinball when you were a kid, or know someone who did, give Pinball FX2 a try.  It's the next best thing to being there again, reliving those memories, and best of all, you won't have to step over any epileptics to do it.","November 17, 2014","true","26.0"," 100 of 128 people (78%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","78","100","128","31","2"

Sorry to say these data thieves got my money now I have to agree to their spyware to keep using. Completely unethical company. Be warned.\n\nUpdate 4. Since Zen expects you to send them a photo of your setup to unlock portrait mode, I made this quip about  multimonitor support; "You must email them a photo of yourself naked with two monitors and holding a recent copy of The New York Times with the headline clearly visible before they will unlock the second monitor support."\nResult?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/recommended/226980/","jipearce82","Senno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/","755 products in account","At launch, Pinball FX 2 was already a fantastic game. Originally released on the Xbox 360, it featured backwards compatibility with the original Pinball FX, and this allowed an already burgeoning title to be filled with even more Pinball goodness. As it stands, there are over 30 tables in the game as of this writing, and each and every one is free to try, with the standout Sorcerer's Lair being completely free.\n\nIt's a little sad knowing that the arcade is no longer truly viable, and I'll never again experience the giddy joy of pumping coins into a table, longing for the extra ball and multiball modes we all love, or watching to see if the numbers matched and I won a free game. But while the arcade as a destination may be on it's final legs, the pinball experience presented in FX 2 is pure unadulterated joy.\n\nThose fond memories are brought to the forefront with this version, the ultimate version of Pinball FX 2. As a free download, this game should find a place in just about every gamer's library, and with tables based on many themes, there are sure to be some you'll love. Each table has their own achievements, backstory, missions, combos, and design.\n\nFor most of the tables, the cost is approximate to what would cost a single game of pinball at the arcade, so value wise the game is excellent value. The hours upon hours of gameplay possibility and replayability is enormous, and there really is something for everyone here - from Ancient Rome to Boba Fett.\n\nIn addition, the table design is above and beyond what can be done with conventional pinball, with full video mini games and hidden extras. Nothing is truly over the top, though there aren't any dead spots either. With seven angles to play from, and a free view angle to fly around the table close up, you'll find plenty to play for. Ramps, drop balls, lit targets, missions, and more are available on each table.\n\nFinely integrated leaderboards will see you play against friends and the community on each and every table, with an overall score representing your prowess across all tables. Local leaderboards and multiplayer should see FX 2 become a staple quick fire up and play at home as well.\n\nThe sound and graphics are really well done - with the narrator both chastising and egging you on to play better, and with rewarding sound bites when you do well. The sound effects are particularly fantastic on Secrets of the Deep, an underwater themed table, and there are classic themes and sound effects on the Star Wars and Marvel themed tables, respectively.\n\nThe game is a joy to watch in action. The design and execution of the tables really cannot be overstated. There are multiple views and options to tune the game to your liking, and the low requirements make this an ideal game for every steam user. Pinball FX 2 is a beautiful game, not just a beautiful pinball game.\n\nOverall this is a game too easy not to enjoy. The low cost and low barrier to entry make this an easy recommend, and the many hours of replayability, the freedom to pick up and play, and just the genuine fun available make this the best virtual pinball title ever made available. It's well worth your time.\n\n9.0/10.","November 27, 2013","true","135.7"," 57 of 78 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","57","78","0","7"

If we want to play pinball today we probably have to do it virtually and Pinball FX2 delivers one of the most enjoyable virtual pinball experiences.\n\nI'm pretty sure the basic concept of pinball needs no introduction but just in case you've been living under rock: You use your flippers to direct a small steel ball around the pinball table and aim for different targets to score as many points as possible while at the same time you try to prevent the ball from falling into the drain or one of the side lanes.\n\nPinball FX2 already offers a variety of tables and new ones are released regularly. All the tables differ widely from each other in terms of gameplay, looks and underlying theme. Some have a somewhat minimalistic layout with only few ramps and extras, others feel almost overloaded with features. Some are easy to get into, others are very challenging and have a steep learning curve. Fans of the Marvel and Star Wars franchises will be delighted to have the opportunity to choose from a selection of acordingly themed tables.\n\nYou can compete with friends in local hotseat multiplayer matches or chase highscores to climb up local and online leaderboards but the competion gets most intense with friend score challenges when you have some other players in your Steam friendlist.\n\nThe game supports keyboard, mouse and controller.\n\nUnlike Pinball Arcade (another great pinball simulation available right here on Steam), that offers authentic recreations of real-life tables licenced from pinball machine manufacturers, all Pinball FX2 tables are original creations by the games developer Zen Studios. This can be a drawback if you want to relive your pinball memories with your favourite tables from the past but it's also an advantage because it allows for more artistic freedom. A freedom the developers put to good use with stunning effects that wouldn't be physically possible in reality, like Marvel characters battling each other across the table, among other things.\n\nAdditional tables come at a decent price, especially if you consider the many hours of entertainment that every single one provides. With the wide variety of genuinely different tables, everyone, casuals and hardcore pinball fanatics alike, will find some tailored to their individual taste. There's really no reason to hesitate to get some pinball action right away.","December 16, 2013","true","79.1"," 47 of 68 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","47","68","0","1"

They could not be built in real life.\nAnd whats more: You play on a 2D table - and then 3D objects just pop up (like Plants vs. Zombies), which really.. does not match the feeling of a flat pinball table.\nAlso you can feel that physics is nearly, but not exacly as in real life. Sometimes it feels to fast, then to slow, then you have camera zoom in on an element. All nicely done; all nothing to do with a real pinball table.\n\nSo far the best virtual tables I know are still the old TimeShock! and bus driver thingy which name I don't remember right now. They are decades old and still look great; sadly do not come with high res/controller support (which is why I tried this one) and don't work as nicely on some machines due to DOS emulation :-/\n\n\nWhy you might still like it:Pinball tables are nicely designed, have lots of different elements (although some feel generic) and use their specific themed sounds, graphics etc. So if you know the movie/game the table is based on, it does provide a nice "ahh, I know that" feeling.\nAlso I did not encounter any performance issues or bugs, controller handling is fine, too.\n\nSo if you don't mind the not-quite-real-feeling, you can give it a try, as it is not a rip-off or anything.

I'm not a big fan at all of Pinball FX and the tables therein. Visually, they're fantastic, but only if you're watching someone else. It's a real pain when Spider Man swings in front of your flippers, or you have massive explosions going off that distract your tracking from the hyper-kinetic ball. Pinball FX is not going for realism or emulating pinball, and is very much invested in maximizing the potential of digital pinball, thus the games feel faster than what you would see in traditional pinball, or even something like The Pinball Arcade. This is usually to the game's detriment, in my eyes.\n\nPersonally, I dislike the feel of the game. At no point does the ball feel controllable, and in some instances, the physics are simply wrong or buggy. Drop catches and live catches are rare but seemingly possible; they don't seem like something you can actively do as the technique looks to me more of a strange collision bug than actual skill and timing.  I found myself having less fun playing the game due to inconsistencies in physics reactions, shots not registering, and collision bugs with flippers, ramps, other balls and walls.\n\nTable rules are deeper than necessary, requiring detailed study of the rule sheet. Which, by itself is fine, however there is a bit of an issue when you can't figure out what you need to shoot for due to information not being presented clearly by the game. Firing up a game and learning the rules intrinsically is just not going to happen. Additionally, many modes require simply grinding shots, which to me, is remarkably boring. Coupled with the shot registration bugs, actually working toward a mode or a strategy tends to be more infuriating than it's worth.\n\nMany of the tables borrow shot concepts from existing pinball tables, which is great! However, they seem to only have borrowed the mechanic, but have not paid any attention to ball flow and angle after the fact - many shots are simply drains waiting to happen. You are literally being punished with a ball drain for successfully making a shot. Additionally, some concepts are used, but simply fail to work. For instance, the Venom table looks to attempt the outlane gate nudge-back concept used on Bally's Centaur... which would be amazing if the designers understood that having the bounce post about a mile away from the gate and the sensitivity for tilting cranked on the game makes the gate-save concept useless.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for something different in the pinball space, try a table from Pinball FX, but do so knowing you're going to be playing tables made by people who don't seem to grasp the idea of game layout or rules design.","March 6","false","10.5"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

I've played pinball machines with strong flippers, but these are just impossible. Even on the near end of the flipper, the ball is launched off of it with nearly the same or exactly the same speed as if you flipped it from the distant end. Second, and nearly as bad, is the ball itself has just the most baffling physical properties. When you strike it with the flippers, it feels almost hollow and just flies off, even on top of the flipper hinge, even if you're trying not to even move the ball at all. If you try to catch the ball by holding the flipper when it comes down one of the side lanes, it rolls completely off the end of the flipper, every single time. You can flip it cleanly up a normal ramp and it will stop dead not even an inch up the ramp as if it lost momentum from spinning/rubbing against the side of the ramp, but then it comes straight back at nearly the same speed it had when you struck it (which is to say, maximum speed, because it always seems to be moving very fast), almost like you flipped it up a 60° incline with no friction at all. This happens in exceedingly random fashion as well; you can hit the same ramp at the same speed and it can go up normally...or not. There doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason to it.\n\nNow, those things on their face make the game unplayable for me. If the underlying physics of the game engine behaved in a predictable way, it might have been different. The table designs themselves look pretty nice. That said, the dichotomy between the free table's design features that are reminiscent of actual pinball machine designs from the 90's and the essentially impossible design features that are only possible because it's a video game are a bit off-putting. I would prefer a table that's designed one way or the other. Especially if I'm going to be asked to put my initials into the Sorcerer's Lair table with the flipper buttons like some kind of non-keyboard-having troglodyte, a table that if it existed in reality would have to be LITERALLY haunted in order to have the same kinds of display features. The camera could use some work too, and yes, I tried all of the different view settings, none of them really helped me, especially when it came to trying to gauge distance on skill shots.\n\nGiven the amount of graphical polish in the game, I really have to wonder how it ended up being this way. I was excited to try the game because the tables look beautiful and well designed, but instead I came away with that weird feeling of disappointment mixed with doubt that makes me wonder if I should keep trying it once again to see if my perception was incorrect. Unfortunately, I kept coming away with the same conclusions each time. Well, at least there's a free table.\n\nEdit: Haters gonna hate. I consider the downvotes validation of everything I said, and you should too. Clarified physics complaints slightly and made other minor changes.

Eventually I had purchased a few more additional tables but had not played them yet.  About 2 weeks after purchasing the tables I went to go play them and there was a new EULA with concerns regarding collection of information and advertisements.

Some things I liked, the initial game is free so you can basically demo it and not have to uninstall/reinstall.  Most of the packs aren't too expensive, I picked up the south park and one of the star wars packs giving me 6 different pinball machines to work with, although I don't much care for the default machine the game gives you for free.  Each machine is configured differently and follows a theme, there are some neat little bonuses that work sort of like mini games, and they also have objectives marked out on the top left to let you know when you've done something right and how to proceed.  All in all I feel a robust 3d pinball game that offers you the choice of your favorite theme and leaderboard for both people on the same computer but steam friends as well.","April 5, 2015","false","5.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

(If it was jivjov I'd be ecstatic!)  But in general do not support any Zen Studios products because they are likely to change your legal terms, say anything they want and you'll be forced to agree or lose your money.\n\nHUGE CON:\nZen/Microsoft added a EULA to the title.  That in and of itself isn't the problem.  As long as the EULA was added BEOFRE consumers purchased the title that would be fine.  The problem is that they are holding every license/subscription hostage for all of the EXISTING consumers who owned this title BEFORE the EULA was added.  e.g. They added the EULA a few months ago and consumers are FORCED to agree to it before they can play the title again.

That way consumers can actually make a choice:\nA) 'I accepting your new legal terms' (and letting the publisher keep the spent money)\nOR\nB) 'I don't agree to your new terms' (and I'll be getting my money back.

WARNING !!!\n\nPlease be aware that, even though the Store Page makes no mention, every Zen Studios FX2 Pinball table or package you buy is actually “early access”, and as such is almost guaranteed to not only have bugs (not just on new tables, but also old and unfixed bugs on tables well over a year old), but most tables continue to generate a more or less constant stream of new bug issues (over 200 since 10/2015.) Zen does little or nothing to notify players when (or IF) problems are ever resolved. I have more than 825 games, yet Zen Studios, FX2 Pinball remains one of the worst, least responsive, most deliberately unpleasant and obtuse Steam vendors I’ve had the displeasure to encounter. I have gone from quite certainly being among the MOST supportive of FX2 players, to perhaps the MOST bitterly disappointed.\n\nAnd if you raise questions, be prepared to be treated as "enemy", as has been the case for numerous of Zen's most concerned and passionate customers, in a bizarre business strategy I've not encountered before in nearly 40 years in business.\n\nI love playing most of these tables, but no one should buy them without being aware of the potential for failure and frustration, and the possibility your scores will never even be recorded properly. As well, Zen Studies has, in the past 6 months alone (since approx.. mid ’15) wiped ALL scores for EVERY player on one table (Avengers – Ultron), and on EVERY one of 55 tables for EVERY player in another score wipe shortly after. This effectively eliminated up to two year’s efforts or more for 202,000 customers, including many disabled players. In doing so, Zen accused players of cheating for utilizing a specific pinball attribute that Zen themselves enabled, and is still available on other FX2 platforms other than Steam. Numerous of the world’s best players, and most helpful and conscientious of pinball advocates, left in protest, abandoning all hope of making use of their OWN significant financial and time investments.\n\nFollowing the SECOND Steam score wipe (early Oct. ‘15) which Zen Studios repeatedly promised NOT to perform, 90%, or 180,000 registered players, had NOT returned in the 3 months following.\n\nBut if you love pinball as much as I do, this is simply a very annoying, irritating and frustrating price to be paid.\n\nBut enough is enough…….\n\nThank you.","December 28, 2015","true","591.0"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","0"

I buy every pinball game I can find, regardless of platform. Pinball FX2 is perhaps the very best virtual pinball game that I have ever played. Let it be known though that there are currently 57 tables available on Steam counting all 8 Super League Football (Soccer) team variants, and I own them all. On October 21st of this year they will release four more tables in a pack. More on those tables in a moment.\n\nUnlike many virtual pinball games the table designs and ball physics are rock-solid. Approx. 30% of their tables are totally original, as in non-licensed. My personal favorite of these is Socerer's Lair. In the interest of completness my least favorite of these is V12, but it may be just me as it's really hard for me to score well on this table. There are two South Park tables, which I love. My favorite is South Park's Super Sweet Pinball. I can spend hours playing that one. There is also a Portal table, which some gamers think of as Portal 3, because it takes place after the events of Portal 2. There is also a table based on The Walking Dead and one, which I love alot, based on the video game franchise Splosion Man. Well, more closely on the second game in the series Ms. Splosion Man, which is what it's called. It has a very anime feel to it that I like. It also reminds me abit of the Sega game for the Dreamcast Space Channel 5.\n\nDisney must love Zen Studios, as approx. 60% of the tables are either based on Star Wars or on Marvel comics and/or films and TV series. Zen recently renewed their licensing agreement for both franchises. Overall these tables range from good to excellent. Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is one of the really good ones, with alot of mini-games. Darth Vader has a stand out line in this one - "I'm altering the game. Pray I don't alter it further." :)\n\nZen Studios has added a new source to license properties for their tables from, Fox Digital. This is where the newest tables come in, to be released on Steam on October 21st as part of a four table pack entitled "Balls of Glory." Reminds me of the old virtual pinball game "Balls of Steel." The pack to be sold on Steam is rumored to sell for $9.95, which is very reasonable. The tables are American Dad Pinball, Archer Pinball, Bob's Burgers Pinball, and Family Guy Pinball. All are based on Fox animated TV series, although Archer airs on FX and FXX (both Fox owned). This deal opens the door for The Simpsons Pinball and Futurama Pinball. In fact it opens the door to alot of possibilities.\n\nThere are only two downsides to Pinball FX2, and that is the EULA and the recent Leaderboards reset. Both bother many. Neither bothers me. The amount of data you fork over isn't nearly as much as is the case with the Steam version of Dream Pinball 3D (see my review), and Pinball FX2 is more stable. In fact it has never crashed on me - ever! The Leaderboards were reset to fix a bug that Zen discovered in the game. Rather than leave it in they took it out, but decided in fairness that this fix, which took out some exploits, made the tables harder to score on, at least for those (like me) who didn't even know that they were there. So they reset the Leaderboards. But they retained the old ones, called Legacy Leaderboards. The Local scores achieved in Hotseat Mode where left intact. If you don't like the EULA I don't recall there being one with the Android Apps.\n\nThere is one Zen table currently unavailable on Steam as it is an Xbox 360 exclusive, and that's Rocky & Bullwinkle. Alot of people, including myself, have requested this table. But Zen no longer has the franchise rights, which means in order for them to release it on Steam they would have to renew that license. I hope they do. In 1993 Data East released a real pin machine, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends, but FarSight hasn't released it yet as part of their The Pinball Arcade game. I hope they will. They've been releasing more Data East tables of late. But I digress.\n\nZen Studios must be doing something right. They started off with 4 employees and now have 75 (see the article on Zen Studios in the June 2015 issue of Game Informer magazine for more information. That would be issue #266).  Zen supports alot of platforms. In addition to the PC via Steam, the "Balls of Glory" pack of tables will be released for iOS, Android (the trailers are already on my Android device in the Zen Pinball app), the PS3, PS4, PS Vita, and the Xbox one. They have more Marvel, Star Wars, and originals confirmed.\n\nThe controls are quite good, both with Keyboard and Control Pad. I am currently using a Logitech Xbox 360 controller set for X Mode, although D Mode does work as well. Not all games seem to be compatible with D Mode, but as I stated Pinball FX2 is. I use X Mode simply because it's compatible with most other games.\n\nCurrently 150 friends on Steam own this game.","October 18, 2015","true","187.7"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","26","48","4","13"

Specifically, video game pinball. The physics work pretty well, and the graphics are solid. Very rarely have I encountered a problem while playing. I can only remember one instance of a ball getting stuck because of a bug.\n\nEdit: Something I wanted to point about my video game pinball comment. What I mean is that these tables are designed to be played longer than the real life counterpart(because they want your money of course). Therefore they have more extra balls you can earn, kickbacks and so on. You can even nudge the table in ways you couldn't do in real life, either because of personal injury or damaging the table itself. Be warned though, most tables will only give you two chances in a period of time before tilting out on you, but it sure can be fun to save a ball that otherwise would have been lost.\n\nOne last thing that relates to the fact this is video game pinball, when you exit out a game in progress, the game will be saved, so don't worry if something comes up, or if you're just having a really good game but you can't play in one sitting.\n\nThe one thing that appeals to me about pinball is that you're always trying to get better, so that you can continue to improve and of course get a better score. One thing that also helps is comparing how well you do with your friends. I have a number of Steam friends just so I can have scores to compare with and try to beat.\n\nI would say overall, the quality of the tables are fantastic. If I have any complaints, it's mostly about the selection-it's that Star Wars and Marvel theme tables dominate the catalog. Now don't get me wrong, I like Star Wars, and I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it would be cool to see different properties more often. (BTW, get Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Star Wars Balance of the Force pack-Starfighter Assault is my favorite table)\n\nI play with my X-Box 360 controller, it works really well with the game.\nI also have my second monitor on portrait mode, which makes a huge difference in seeing the table. If you can have that setup I totally recommend it.\n\nI never got to play real pinball that much, there's no arcades where I live, and of course getting a real machine is very expensive, so I think this is a good alternative. And the price for tables is decent.\nAlso, there is a free table, and you can try all the tables to see what they're like.\n\nI recommend this game. Have fun, and may the bumpers be with you.","September 17, 2014","true","89.0"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

I recommend starting off with one of the packs, which gives you 4 tables, and buy tables as you go along. And as I've found, returning to old tables after your skill increases, the replay value is there.\n\n3D works great if you've got the gear for it, and at first I only played 3D and anytime I looked at the tables in 2D, they looked flat and strange, and I couldn't play them.

PinballFX, honestly, is one of them.\n\nWith the game, whether you just want to play the game casually, or to stomp your friends' high score, it's all catered. With tons of tables to play with (woooo thanks Humble Bundle) and well made tables, makes the experience fun.\n\nThe gameplay is the same old, you only need to jump directly and play. All you need to do is to keep the ball inside your table and don't let it fall off. But unlike other pinball games I've played, this one offers an in-tables quests depending on where we aim the ball to thus makes the session more interesting to play and achieving higher personal scores isn't like a long mindless grind. And if you ever are confused with the tables, there's a help file (just pause the game and click on help) so you know of the table's objectives and on what to do.\n\nThe tables designs are full with vibrant color and light, more than enough to please my eyes. And they're not fully static, with several addons side characters and mini tables (quest result), you're not just seeing a ball bouncing right and left.\n\nThe tables are sold separately as 'DLC's. Make sure you read the appropriate store page of each DLC to know how many tables you're getting (yes, some are packaged together as one DLC, so 4 tables-for-one is not surprising). For tables reviews, refer to each Store Page's review, as it's too expansive to be reviewed in this single writing.\n\nGame natively supports local hot seat, but I personally would've liked to have a MP versus with friends thru internet, would've been much easier to play together. Not a big deal for missing the feature though.\n\nIf you're unsure if you're interested enough, you can try the tables for a limited time and see for yourself. I personally haven't bought/gotten every single tables, but I'm quite sure the more tables I have, the merrier it will be.","November 26, 2013","true","57.4"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

I've written a long list of things I that would change to make this a beter video game.\n\nThat being said:\nEverything about it feels good, like a pinball machine is supposed to. The physics in the game feel like you'd expect. The free table is very well designed, fun to play, and could give hours of fun on its own. A really good business decision they made is that you can try out any DLC table for a couple minutes as many times as you want. I've tried out many tables a few times to see if it was fun to me, which of course led to me buying some tables I'm really enjoying. The tables are reasonably priced as well, for a few dollars each (what a couple games on a real machine would cost) you can play as long and as many times as you want.\n\nI'm not sure what more I can say other than try out the free table.\n\nEDIT: Changed my review to negative, though it's best videogame pinball experienve I've had, due to devolper and moderator actions/attutude toward players.\n\nThe devs literally never check the forums, interact with, or take input from any player ever.\nZen reset the leaderboards and all of the (limited number who knew before it happened) players had much to say in suggestions to lessen the impact of the reset, but Zen listened to NONE of it. They just went ahead with the short-sighted, insulting, plans they made from their Fortress of Solitude. This caused many players to never return to the game. This includes legitimate top scorerers who helped out the community with support more than the moderator or devs ever have. The loss of this player and their help & advice was a big blow to the community.\n\nSpeaking of which, the moderator "Barbie Bob-omb"...\nThis person often refuses to do their job, like answering questions, or being a go between with the devs and players. They've been seeming to try to do their job better for a couple days lately as of this edit, but a new DLC table pack was released, we'll see how long this lasts...\n\nHowever they've also banned someone whose every post only tried to make the game better.\nThis is a travesty, and really shows the moderator has succumbed to the temptation of weilding power over those whose point out the bugs and flaws in the game and the work of the devs/mods.","March 19, 2015","false","98.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ball physics are generally top notch with only a couple of tables that love to see you fail (Civil War to name one); both the Marvel and Star Wars theme tables are spread across a wide sub-genre of characters, films, comics and cartoons; high score tables are implemented perfectly well, with notifications in-game to spur you on as you edge closer to a friend's score.\n\nIt's pretty much the best Pinball game since Pinball Dreams - and while it may look like the developers are attempting to nickel and dime you with the amount of available packs, you'd be better off to pick them up one at a time and learn the tactics involved with each set. The 4-table packs can easily see you playing for 2 to 3 hours (per table) in order to truly appreciate where your high scores can be bettered, and there's rarely a dud table amongst them all.\n\nIf you've the remotest interest or nostalgia for Pinball then do yourself a favour and pick up a pack or two, you won't regret it.","November 26, 2013","true","8.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Everything is pretty simple to follow and you do have a few options you can do with the settings although a couple of the controller ones might need a bit of work. Of course you can change the keys if you use a keyboard and there is a number of display and audio options. The restriction there is that the game is full screen - no windowed mode. It does have an orientation setting so you can even flip the game to portrait (90deg)- I was even stupid enough to try this and play it, now that was weird, but fun! I even toyed with trying to flip my monitor on my desk to match. Sheesh I mist be pitiful ;-)\n\nThe game itself is great, everything any pinball lover would want and it comes installed free of charge with 1 fully working pinball table, and it's no cheap table either - it's one of the better ones. Speaking of tables, well I haven't got them all yet and I guess thats the beauty of this system. You can try any of the available tables first in the game, it gives you a fairly brief period of time to play, just enough to get an idea of the table, then if you like it you can go buy it as DLC. Some tables are sold separately and there are also table packs (3 or 4 tables in the pack) which works out slightly cheaper.\n\nMy favourite table so far is Ms Splosion Man, it's kinda crazy - a bit like me I suspect. I have the 2nd highest score amongst my pinball friends on it - yet another thing about the game, you can add your friends or others with Pinball FX2 and see their scores in your game. That gives a bit of motivation to try and beat them. leaderboards, Wizard Scores and apparently tournaments - but I've not participated in one of those yet.\n\nMost of the tables can be a bit daunting the first time you play, especially if you are like me and don't bother reading anything and just jump in and play. Thankfully however, there are guides for every table within the game, you can actually pause out and read what you are supposed to be doing during the game if you like. The guides are pretty good overall, they give you enough info on the various things you can do in a table without making you have to read forever. Fairly well set out as well.\n\nDefinitely worth the free download price and even more so worth spending money on for more tables to play.

(e.g. an upper set of flippers mapped backwards.) mostly, though, this hasn't been a huge issue, but it's definitely a constant annoyance, and it's one difference from most real pinball tables and also at least one other pinball game i've played, 'Pinball Arcade'.\n\nalso, either the game or the tables seem to be poorly optimized; i get more frame-rate issues and the like on this than i do on the majority of immersive 3D games i play; and i have played another pinball title (Pinball Arcade, focused on emulating actual tables rather than creating new ones) which has no issues at all on my machine.  if you have such issues, you'll need to figure out how to enable triple buffering for your machine, which can be a hassle.\n\nstill, well worth the effort IMO; but c'mon Zen! the game has been out there for a long time now, and IMO there's no reason at all not to be able to fix these problems; at least using the known solution that seems to fix the issues on most systems. why not just spend the few days/weeks of developer time to at least enable that much of a fix on the majority of the systems that having the issue rather than leaving your customers, some of whom are going to be far from technical, to have to find and implement what can be a quirky PITA solution?\n\nand for that matter, you ought to be optimizing this thing so it sings; it's very disappointing, after having seen what was perfectly acceptable performance for a pinball game way back—on a Pentium with a PCI video card—to be left with the feeling that the game is at least moderately sluggish in some cases. and, yes, i know it's more complex than that, but the point is that this really isn't rocket science here, guys, and optimizing the engine should have been a top priority.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nif you like pinball in one form or another, and especially if you like the themes of the tables offered, this is a good game to have; for the number of hours of entertainment, seems hard to go wrong here. if you hit it at the appropriate time you can even get it for practically a steal; and i'm assuming more sales will be on in the future. generally this seems like a good one to go for if you are just looking for the pinball feel, and think you would enjoy the themes for which you can get tables...\n\nif you are an oldskool pinball enthusiast, however, i would recommend checking out "Pinball Arcade" before FX2: it has emulations of many *real* tables, and can be a relatively fair price if you buy the Season packs rather than individual tables. i certainly can't afford it, but if thats the kind of experience you're looking for you're not likely to find a better deal.

I have purchased all the tables with the exception of the new Dr. Strange, and played all a number of times.   I must say, the diversity of challenges and overall feel of the different tables is truly incredible.  Some flipper and ball action is lightning fast on newer tables, while others are true to their original old-school roots; those found in the Zen Classics Pack play slower and more subdued; you can almost feel the bulk of the flippers, with less flashy play and heavier movement.  Be it the 3D environments of the Star Wars or Marvel tables, the minimalism of V12, El Dorado or Mars, the flash of Ms. Splosion or the charm of Epic Quest and Earth Defense, there is something for everyone here.   IMHO, V12 and Tesla are the hardest to score points on; V12 has a rather brutal left lane gap that is an unholy drain of the worst order.  But for either a quick pick-up game or lengthy marathon, you can't go wrong with this re-imagining of an arcade staple.  You have your choice of 360 controller support (which is quite responsive) or keyboard bashing.  And the community score leaders and Pinball Wizard status allows you to not only challenge friends, but challenge yourself to reach the pinnacle of others playing a particular table.  Superb overview of achievements and table layouts compliment your quest, and you will find yourself unlocking new challenges at every turn. Highly recommended.","February 2, 2014","true","56.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Both have similar revenue models (free with paid tables) and both offer dynamic viewpoints for optimal play. But while Pinball Arcade's legacy tables are nice, I would have to say Pinball FX2 is a superior product. It's not just the Marvel and Star Wars licensed tables (though they certainly help) but I feel Pinball FX2 definitely takes advantage of the fact that it is a video game and therefore its tables can do things that are incredibly difficult if not impossible on a real table (including mechanics and animated models) while still keeping realistic pinball physics. Pinball FX2 does not insult customers by offering "professional" versions of tables. All tables feature operator menus and certain tables feature special balls (The Avengers table in fact makes it a gameplay mechanic). Besides Star Wars and Marvel, Pinball FX2 offers many tables that are a joy to play and very engaging. The Super League Football table in particular has become a table I am incredibly fond of. And lest not forget there is a free table in the form of Sorcerer’s Lair which is nothing to sneeze at. It's just as fun and of good quality as any of the paid tables.\n\nFor me, personally apart from the quality of the product, one of the biggest draws that encourages me to keep playing is the native integration with Steamworks so that all of your friends' high scores for any give table are automatically displayed in game. Thus it becomes a game in itself to see if you can best your friends' high scores.\n\nOverall this is a wonderful product if you enjoy pinball. I don't want to say its "better" than Pinball Arcade due to the different roles they fill, but it definitely has a much better pricing model. Must play.","March 23, 2014","true","23.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With the arrival of Pinball FX on XBOX 360 in 2007, it finally found its match, and 3 years later with Pinball FX 2, it got its successor, a new pinball king.\nZen Studios brought into the virtual pinball world, something that we have not seen before. Stellar ideas, ingenious presentation and perfect gameplay. Each table is a master piece of its own. So much to do on each of them and so much going on. Enriched with beautiful musical scores, great sound effects and animated 3D characters jumping around the tables.\nIf you take a few minutes away from the action, and hold the camera button while moving the mouse around, you can look at all the details and love that was put in every square inch of every table and also of the surronding area where the tables is standing. I love and play every single table that was made, except 1, Extreme, which is not present in Steam version anyway.\nWith so many tables present, with new ones coming all the time, you really cannot get bored, because when you make the whole circle through all the tables, the initals ones will feel so new and fresh again, you are ready for another tour, and another,.....\n\nWhatever the system you're playing on, Zen Studios' pinball game is deffinitely the one you should not stay without.","August 2, 2014","true","46.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Instead, you will get the essence of what makes pinball great in a super addictive package. There are so many well thought out mini games and goals on each table that it will boggle your mind. I suggest you disable the music as well as the pinball "streak" effect before you play. It seems to help me focus and creates a more realistic feel. There are no authentic tables here. They are all original and each has a very unique theme.\n\nThey did a fantastic job of mixing elements that "could" be in a "real" table with stuff that would be physically impossible to create in real life. In my opinion - it's a perfect balance. Steam scores and acheivments are built in and will give you instant and real-time feedback of your skills as you improve. Seeing where you stand against your friends and everyone else in the world is all right there. It isn't buried behind some menu. I do not suggest using a keyboard to play if you can avoid it. Plug in a USB dual analog and remap the keys if you have that available to you. The graphics are crisp and full of color and effects. It's better (or on par with) than many Future Pinball tables i've played. It's a shame such high fidelity isn't available in the Pinball Arcade official release here on steam. More work may have been involved with that due to the tedious re-construction of actual pinball tables.

When this first hit the xbox platform I finally found a reason to play xbox, well, other than the Forza series. Though, I probably even still spent more time in Pinball FX2. And now being on PC, I get to spend all my PC time (well, iMac time. Yes, it plays perfect on iMac too via CrossOver) again with my first true love, pinball. Of all the fantastic tables available, I think still to this day Secrets of the Deep in the FX2 core pack is still a huge favorite of mine. The crazy multi-ball on this table is just like awesome, and the music also helps take you from the real world and into pinball world. Yes, their really is a pinball world, though if you do EVER make it their, you will NEVER want to leave :)…  Each table has loads of variety and will keep you entertained for many many hours. If you even think you could love pinball, of even if you don’t, you owe it to yourself to try this. The FREE table it does come with, Sorcerer’s Lair was just one of the ones I purchased on xbox due to the fact its also a really good table. If I had to pick 1 issue with Pinball FX2, other than not being a native mac port, it would have to be I was really disappointed to not see the weekly leaderboard scores. But hey, it just means more hours to get the really big score to hit the top ten all-time leaderboards after all. Sorry, have to leave now to go find an opening to pinball world.. See you their…….

It's "Free to Play," but only comes with one starter table, "The Sorceror's Lair." The free table, however, is one of my favorites. Additional tables are reasonably priced. Most of them are really enjoyable. If you're just looking for something to kill 20-30 minutes of time, you can hit up a few tables, and have some casual gaming fun. If you're a huge pinball fan, you'll probably love this game. The tables have a variety of objectives for those who have the skill to achieve them. If you hate pinball, you'll probably hate this. I sometimes find it frustrating in the same way I find a physical pinball machine to be frustrating.\n\nI am horrible at pinball. It shows every time I play this game, yet I've already logged 6 hours into this and keep purchasing new tables to try out. I couldn't play this for hours at a time, but for small doses when I don't have the attention span for story-based games, this is one of my top choices to play.\n\nThe animations and voiceovers are interesting and there are 8 different table views, which is a great feature. If you don't like the camera angle on a table, you can easily swap it to another at any time with the touch of a button. You can tweak your settings, too, if you don't mind giving up the leaderboards. When I really like a table, I will sometimes increase my ball count to 10 just to keep playing the same table and see how high I can get my score.","December 8, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Of course you have to rotate your display too to play it properly in this scenario ... ;)\n\nWhat annoys me a little is that the position of the flipper table's LCDs can't be fixed to the full width bottom or top of the screen like in good old amiga pinball games. Having this feature built in it would make it to the best modern pinball game known to me today (I still count "Slamtilt" under modern I must assume here ... ;).\n\nGo buy it now!

It is one of the best of Pinball FX2 so that is definitely much more than just a demo. (Played it for 3 hours so far.) Also all other tables have time limited trials so it's pretty fun to try them out too.\n\nPinball FX2 is arguably the best digital pinball game you'll ever play. Finally there's game competing what Pro-Pinball gave a near perfect example in the late 90's. None of these tables are bad but with current selection of themes (what Steam version currently supports) are still 52% Marvel Comics. 14 tables with other themes are still unreleased on this platform but I bet they are coming eventually.\n\nIt's also fair to mention that each table stays in development from 6-9 months which definitely justifies that $3€ price tag but you don't really need more than the free one and maybe an additional table to start with.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/226980/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4197 products in account","One thing about the game is that it feels more organic.  In most pinball games, the game feels like it in entirely on rails, not just the visible ones placed on the table.  Once you learned how these rails work, earning large scores becomes an easy task.\n\nThat rail feeling is not a problem in this game.  The way that the ball moves, it feels more organic.  While where the ball is when you use the flippers is important, ball speed and bounciness are also a factor.  This makes that a shot that worked the first time will not necessarily work again the next time.  Having the ball move as it does in real life, it means that ball control is much more important in order to succeed.\n\nThe biggest draw about the game is seeing everything moving around on the boards.  Most modern pinball games have things that move around as things happen.  However, these movements are always simple that you can see even before the game start.  Once you trigger that movement, seeing it happen again is interesting only if it builds your score.\n\nWhat makes the game unique among most pinball games is that game table feels alive.  As you trigger certain targets, things will happen that would never happen in a normal pinball game.  In Earth Defense, a giant robot is trying to attack you.  If its lasers connect, it will cause your ball to change direction.  In The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader will use his force powers to block and even destroy your ball if you get close to him.  Even in Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos will alter the gameplay by swapping the controls and even turning the table upside down.  With all the special movements that can happen, it makes it worth it to experience the special moments of each table.\n\nAdding to the uniqueness are the games within the games.  Most pinball games will try to add more by simply using the scoreboard in order to play a bad video minigame.  Working with the video game format, these tables hold more than any physical table can hold.  In Moon Knight, he will use the ball as ammo to fire as hiding villains.  Tesla's table has a smaller table where you try to enter a goal using electro flippers.  In Paranormal, the ball can enter a higher second table in the attic in order to search for ghosts.  In what has to be the collection's highlight, in Star Wars: Starfighter Assault, you will go outside the table completely to shoot TIE fighter in what looks like the old-school game Galaga.  Knowing that there is more in store, spending additional time to explore them completely is a necessity.\n\nThe one sticking point with the game is the price.  They give everybody one table, Sorcerer’s Lair, as a free table.  For all the rest, you have to pay for them separately.  With individual tables costing three dollars and a pack costing 10, it can get expensive to buy the full game.  If you want the full package, it is necessary to pay over 100 dollars.  At that price, the best way to get it all is to try to get them through a bundle.  Without a bundle, you need to make sure you try each table before buying.","December 26, 2013","true","62.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

There isn't just scoring opportunity, there are layers, and many of them, and throught time you find the secrets to higher scoring, you can compete with friends or with the world, there's even Guides for the specific games, and beyond that it enhances fans of Marvel Comics, or Star Wars, and the latest one (as of this writing) with Soccer is an absolute blast, and I know nothing about soccer.

The game gets some flack for not having realistic tables, but that doesn't mean they aren't awesome fun!  If you have some friends playing, competing for high score is also very addictive.\n\nThey give you one of their best tables for free, and sell additional tables for relatively low prices, especially if you grab them on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/226980/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","It's been a long time since I've seen a really good pinball video game.  Pinball FX2 pushes all the right buttons, bringing me back to when I used to play Epic Pinball on my 486 machine 20 years ago.  It fully supports both keyboard and gamepad control and both work very well.  My only gripe with controls is that manual control over the plunger is very difficult to use and only seems to utilize less than half of a thumbstick's range.\n\nThe main strength of this game is the table design.  Since all the tables are original, they aren't constrained by the laws of physics or physical design limitations like real tables are.  It allows the tables to all have their own unique feel and utilize game mechanics that are only possible here.  Unfortunately this brings with it some wonky ball physics in some places, mostly from balls rolling back down ramps though I believe this was done on purpose to avoid straight gutter balls.\n\nThe game utilizes global and friend leaderboards as well as having 2 achievements per table to add to replayability.  It's great fun beating your friends' scores and hunting down the achievements, some of which are extremely difficult.\n\nOn the downside, some of the tables have some minor performance problems such as stuttering when transitioning between the main table and a sub-table for a minigame.  Some people also experience input lag though I believe it is pretty rare.  Overall, the graphics are fantastic and it runs very smoothly so it's easy to ignore the sporadic problems.  A bigger issue for me is that the character banter on some of the tables (especially the licensed ones) can get quite tiring.  There does not seem to be any way to disable it without turning off the sound completely.\n\nSome people may also be put off by having to buy tables separately.  They come in packs of 3-4 for $10 or single tables for $3 which seems pretty reasonable to me.  On sale, it's a bargain.  In addition, you can demo any table for a couple minutes before you buy to see if you like it before spending any money.  The game also has one free table that everyone can enjoy.\n\nIf you like pinball, this is the game for you.","December 1, 2013","true","43.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

Graphically very slick also. Highly recommended tables would include 'Plants vs Zombies', 'Ms Splosion man' (don't let the pink put ya off), and 'Quest for epic loot' (hope I got the name of that one right). The free table 'Sorcerer's lair' also has a high degree of replayability and a nice little 'mini game / sub table' section to add to the fun. Personally I play with a game pad but I see no reason why this would be any less fun playing with keys.","October 6, 2014","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm a huge pinball fan and pinball FX2 is a faithful and fantastic reincarnation of those childhood pinball memories. The option for arcade-style 4 person local play is great and the controls feel responsive and genuine playing on a 360 pad.\nGraphically this game is gorgeous although at max settings I have seen some frame stuttering on certain tables even with my Sandy Bridge i7 and GTX 680. I can see this being an issue when running the game on a low end PC since such precise reflexes are needed to master a table and reach those wizard high scores.\nThe only other mild complaint I have is not actually my own; I enjoy playing local games with my parents and while I have no trouble with video games, there are a handful of tables that are bafflingly complicated and opaque, the ball sometimes seems to be "underneath" a piece of the scenery for 75-80% of the time that it is in play and it can ruin the fun. That being said, the problem is easily avoiding by not buying a table that you find hard to understand.\n\nIt's free (for one table), beautiful, and faithful to the pinball day's of old. Absolutely recommend to other 90's pinball fans!","November 25, 2013","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is one of the best of Pinball FX2 so that is definitely much more than just a demo. (Played it for 3 hours so far.) Also all other tables have time limited trials so it's pretty fun to try them out too.\n\nPinball FX2 is arguably the best digital pinball game you'll ever play. Finally there's game competing what Pro-Pinball gave a near perfect example in the late 90's. None of these tables are bad but with current selection of themes (what Steam version currently supports) are still 52% Marvel Comics. 14 tables with other themes are still unreleased on this platform but I bet they are coming eventually.\n\nIt's also fair to mention that each table stays in development from 6-9 months which definitely justifies that $3€ price tag but you don't really need more than the free one and maybe an additional table to start with.

The tables look fantastic, have many unique layouts, and include great combos and multipliers to unlock.\n\nMy only complaint is that despite having licenses for Marvel and Star Wars-related films, the voice characterization is garbage. None of the sound clips or voice acting is from the original licensed film that the table is related to, and is usually done by a vaguely-similar sounding voice actor. The voice clips are repetitive and will drive you insane quite quickly.\n\nRecommended because yes, it is an insanely fun pinball game, but the voice acting will get on your nerves.","November 27, 2013","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are what you'd expect from a game where you only see a pinball table most of the time and the graphical options are minimal.  However, the great detail put into the tables and into the various minigames are where the game really makes it's mark in quality.  With all the crazy elements the average map has going on while you're playing, this obviously isn't a game trying to replicate an authentic pinball experience and Zen Studios uses this to their full advantage.  On Star Wars tables you might have X-Wings and Tie Fighters shooting at each other or anti-aircraft guns shooting at them.  You might see Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fighting or Boba Fett in action.  Whether it's Star Wars, Marvel characters or any of the other tables, the table design, mini games and action on the sides have all been crafted to fit in with the reality of each tables fictional (or in some cases real life) universe.\n\nThere's nearly 50 maps out currently and you will find a dud here and there if you played every map but the number of high quality fun maps available is awesome.  The sound is decent, nothing particulary stands out there.  Considering how long you can last on some of the maps, it's the perfect game to listen to your own music while you play.  Some of the maps can feel cheap at times.  When you hit a seemingly good shot then it goes in one of the side gutters without giving you a chance to stop it, it can feel cheap.  You always want to feel like the reason you lost is because of a mistake you made, not because the table is designed to be very unforgiving to shots at certain angles.  The value someone can get out of this game is endless really.  There's enough maps out there to last hundreds of hours and hundreds more hours spent to truly master them all.  It's a great game with maps and patches that are still being put out for it.  Highly Recommended.","October 8, 2014","true","94.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","5"

When this first hit the xbox platform I finally found a reason to play xbox, well, other than the Forza series. Though, I probably even still spent more time in Pinball FX2. And now being on PC, I get to spend all my PC time (well, iMac time. Yes, it plays perfect on iMac too via CrossOver) again with my first true love, pinball. Of all the fantastic tables available, I think still to this day Secrets of the Deep in the FX2 core pack is still a huge favorite of mine. The crazy multi-ball on this table is just like awesome, and the music also helps take you from the real world and into pinball world. Yes, their really is a pinball world, though if you do EVER make it their, you will NEVER want to leave :)…  Each table has loads of variety and will keep you entertained for many many hours. If you even think you could love pinball, of even if you don’t, you owe it to yourself to try this. The FREE table it does come with, Sorcerer’s Lair was just one of the ones I purchased on xbox due to the fact its also a really good table. If I had to pick 1 issue with Pinball FX2, other than not being a native mac port, it would have to be I was really disappointed to not see the weekly leaderboard scores. But hey, it just means more hours to get the really big score to hit the top ten all-time leaderboards after all. Sorry, have to leave now to go find an opening to pinball world.. See you their…….

The Star Wars tables are based on that famous scene where Boba Fett tries to shoot a tiny ball with a laser.

It's "Free to Play," but only comes with one starter table, "The Sorceror's Lair." The free table, however, is one of my favorites. Additional tables are reasonably priced. Most of them are really enjoyable. If you're just looking for something to kill 20-30 minutes of time, you can hit up a few tables, and have some casual gaming fun. If you're a huge pinball fan, you'll probably love this game. The tables have a variety of objectives for those who have the skill to achieve them. If you hate pinball, you'll probably hate this. I sometimes find it frustrating in the same way I find a physical pinball machine to be frustrating.\n\nI am horrible at pinball. It shows every time I play this game, yet I've already logged 6 hours into this and keep purchasing new tables to try out. I couldn't play this for hours at a time, but for small doses when I don't have the attention span for story-based games, this is one of my top choices to play.\n\nThe animations and voiceovers are interesting and there are 8 different table views, which is a great feature. If you don't like the camera angle on a table, you can easily swap it to another at any time with the touch of a button. You can tweak your settings, too, if you don't mind giving up the leaderboards. When I really like a table, I will sometimes increase my ball count to 10 just to keep playing the same table and see how high I can get my score.","December 8, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Of course you have to rotate your display too to play it properly in this scenario ... ;)\n\nWhat annoys me a little is that the position of the flipper table's LCDs can't be fixed to the full width bottom or top of the screen like in good old amiga pinball games. Having this feature built in it would make it to the best modern pinball game known to me today (I still count "Slamtilt" under modern I must assume here ... ;).\n\nGo buy it now!

I recently built an arcade cabinet (with flipper buttons on the sides) and figured Pinball FX2 would be wonderful on it.  Sadly, the flipper lag is just enough to take you out of the pinball experience.  Try playing "Future Pinball" and you'll see what I mean.  When flippers in a pinball game are responsive, you forget that you're not playing on a real pinball table.\n\nEdit: After doing some research, I discovered that by disabling VSYNC and setting my pre-rendered frames to 1 (both done in the Nvidea control panel), the flippers became perfectly responsive.  As such, I can recommend this game without hesitation.\n\nMy only hope now is for a nice sale on the tables.

The tables are diverse and well thought out, and common shots and ramps rarely drain directly unless you've put some weird spin on the ball.\n\nIn terms of bugs, the game is solid, but for me required a couple of system tweaks to make it playable due to what was otherwise pronounced input lag (disable v-sync and drop the "maximum pre-rendered frames" setting to 1 in your video drivers). Check out the pinned thread in the Steam forums for more details.\n\nAdditionally, for me, the Spiderman table is completely unplayable as a ball goes missing half way through a game and never reappears.\n\nNeither of the above problems was resolved when I recently refreshed my system with a new install of Windows 8 64, upgraded from Windows 7 64.\n\nA huge amount of work has gone into table designs, every table puts its own unique spin on things and all are originals. This means that they are also a little more forgiving than many real world tables as they don't have to factor in eating your money.\n\nAll tables reward skill, and generally offer a good variety of modes, multiballs and combos to keep things interesting.\n\nThe ball physics are excellent, although ball speeds are perhaps a little bit faster than real world tables (noticeably faster on some tables, less so on others). Regardless, if you are already a fan of real-world pinball you won't have any trouble picking things up where you left off.\n\nEven though I've been a die-hard pinball fan for many years, I've tended to shy away from electronic versions as they've not given me the same satisfying real world sense of interactivity, from the slap of the flipper buttons to nudging the table.\n\nPinball FX2 doesn't solve this lack of physical interactivity, in that controls are simply left and right space bars for the flippers and the control keys and space bar to nudge the table.\n\nIn my case, however, I've recently acquired a new mechanical keyboard, and if you're like me and need a bit more physical feedback to recreate the experience you're used to I can highly recommend the investment. My mechanical keys now provide exactly the right tactile slap from hitting the flippers.\n\nI also find that, as I'm a decent player, most tables are generous in awarding kickbacks, and therefore my main reason for nudging is rarely necessary (and if you're not a decent player, why would you even try?).\n\nThe sound is quite effective at ball-clack noises, bumpers and the like.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that some tables get carried away with the video-game potential through such things as glowing balls, sped-up balls in certain game modes, and full video-game style mini games.\n\nIf you are someone, like me, who prefers a more 'pure' pinball experience, you will find that these tables can get irritating very quickly. Thankfully, there is enough variety (if you can afford it) to largely stay away from the more painful examples. I've also turned off ball glow trails in options as I was finding the ball glow was sometimes interfering with my ability to read the ball.\n\nAs you will observe with a quick overview of the available DLC, Zen Studios have taken full advantage of its Star Wars and Marvel licenses. In my view this is a shame as the non-licensed tables feel far more creative, original and varied than those heavily reliant on movie imagery and sound-bites.\n\nOverall, however, I've had a lot of fun with Pinball FX2 and can enthusiastically recommend it.","December 21, 2013","true","163.9"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

From poor flipper response and unrealistic physics this is just about selling DLC in the form of tables. If the tables were true thats one thing but its just a merchandising effort, plain and simple.\nI'm guessing the reviewers have never grown up playing actual pinball tables and the reviews show it.\nPlay the free tables, see how poorly the flippers react and the general physics are then spend a few hundred and buy your own table.

I cannot promise you I will make it through this review without discussing smacking balls, handling balls, cradling balls, being swarmed by balls, having your balls sucked down the hole....  You get the idea.  I am apparently still ten years old and there's just no helping that sort of thing when a game is fundamentally about how well it treats your balls.\n\nI want to try and start this review on a sober note, though.  I am deadly serious about pinball.  I love pinball.  And, let's be honest, you do too or you wouldn't be reading a review about simulated pinball.  In the realm of games pinball is like a sharpened stick compared to the large hard-on colliders that are video games today.  But I still remember playing this one wicked old machine about a million years ago in my friend's aunt's basement.  We played that ♥♥♥♥ all night long, stomping the old high score into the dirt.  It was an old cowboy themed table, with no story or complex goals to achieve.  It was just a silver ball, a couple paddles, some targets, bumpers, and a ramp.  Your only goal was to keep the ball in the air, letting it cause as much chaos as possible while the score rolled up.  That ball was so ♥♥♥♥in' heroic.  And I don't mean like kids with cancer or a flower growing up through a crack in the sidewalk.  This was like the guy from "They Live!" on a completely hopeless mission that he's got to do anyway because he's a badass.\n\nThat got rambly.  But you know what?  I don't care!  I measure every pinball experience I have against that cowboy table and the other pinball games I've played.  Come on, you do it too with your own tables.  Pinball's a nostalgia thing.  That's just how it is.  So to review Pinball FX2, I've got ask myself: how does this compare to the cowboy table?  How 'bout all the other real and simulated tables I've played?\n\nThe answer, like the game's protagonist, is gray and all over the place.  What Pinball FX2 does well, it does really well.  What it does badly is just inexcusable.  (And I played most of the non-free tables outside of my Steam account so my play time is higher)\n\nWhat does it do well?  Well, there are visually interesting tables, with goals that pantomime simple stories and give you huge bonuses if you manage to meet certain conditions.  They're very much like the pinball machines I remember from arcades in the 90s.  I very much appreciate that the aesthetic of the boards is kept artificial and mechanical like a real table, but they aren't bound to that rule.  There are some imaginative, organic models and they use lighting and particle effects as you'd expect from a modern game.  It doesn't ruin the pinball experience, but justifies a pinball video game because you can do impossible things you could only dream of doing with your balls in real life!  And such variety!  Break out a new table, load your balls in the shaft, and enjoy shooting them all over such beloved characters as Spider-Man, Princess Leia, and King Arthur.\n\nThe music is fairly engaging and, for the most part, the sound effects are satisfyingly weighty.  The game makes a good effort putting the camera how you want it with several different perspectives, from zoomed in on the ball, to hovering above the entire table.  It's not perfect, though, because it can't be.  Let's face it, boys, in real life when there are some perfectly formed spheres in front of you, all your focus is on them even though you're keeping the periphs on everything else that's going on.  But while it's all flattened out on your monitor that's just not possible.  Still, they did the best they could.  And, as playing pinball is like making love, they give you options to adjust the angle of the table and thus the speed of the ball.  Though, as in making love, doing so will disqualify you from the leaderboards.\n\nSo what does it do so badly?  Well, a few things.  The physics feel a bit off.  Woah!  That is seriously bad!  That is the one thing you need to be correct for a pinball game.  Yeah, but they're not  too  off.  I'll freely admit it might even be my imagination, but I swear the ball doesn't always behave consistently when I trap and shoot it from the same part of the flipper.  The gravity feels about right, but once in awhile you'd definitely hear me screaming "BS!" at the screen.  Granted, I might do that with a real pinball machine and I might just suck from not having played enough pinball.  However, despite having controller support for nice modern pads like the 360 controller that has those nice analog shoulder buttons, you can only smack the paddle at full strength.  Now that might be great if you have children acting up, but pinball requires a gentler touch: floating your ball from one flipper to the other, releasing your balls as if gently kissed by an angel.  That's pinball, baby!  And while that might seem really petty to you guys, remember I'm putting Pinball FX2 against the cowboy machine and that is a serious failure.  At least other computer pinball I've played has been aware of placing different force upon the ball depending on what area of the paddle it's leaving, and Pinball FX2 doesn't roll that way.  When you hit your balls that hard all the time it just doesn't feel good, man.\n\nAlright, so that's bad.  Damning I would say.  But a couple of you might just shrug and say "what do you really expect from computer pinball?" or even, "You're only noticing those faults because Pinball FX2 is actually sort of close to real pinball unlike other computer games!"  Fair enough.  But let Pinball FX2, who is about to die, salute you, because I am about to signal the end of its days in this arena.  It succeeds somewhat by having a variety of tables, but that variety is superficial.  Every table is ultimately a 90s table with complicated goals, LED readouts, and animatronic trickery (animated trickery here).  Nowhere to be found is the simple cowboy table, where just keeping the ball in the air and maybe trying to get a whole group of targets down is all you need.  There's a purity in that experience, where a silver ball crashing around uncontrolled is still a win condition, from smashing the spinner out of the gate to careening off the last ill-fated bumper and down the drain.  Those tables aren't here, nor is anything in that minimal, old timey vain.  It's all the same glut of particles and complex models.  And remember, a Pinball game can only be about nostalgia, so leaving that out is real bad.\n\nI'm sure hard work goes into designing these tables, but I can't help but see them as just a reskin of the same free table.  I remember when I got "Take a Break! Pinball" on my Windows 3.0 computer.  It was awful, but for the couple of bucks I spent, I got half a dozen tables with distinct character.   When I was in middle school, I got a free pinball CD with three  tables from a cereal box that had good graphics for the age and played satifyingly if not like the real thing.  (It was probably not a cereal box.   It would be dumb to have a CD in a cereal box.)  Point is: the business model for this game is just deplorable.  They'd ultimately charge you one hundred sixty US dollars for pinball reskins.  That makes me mad.  Now, I know, you're saying "just buy the ones you really want and leave the rest, dingus!"\n\nYeah, well, sorry.  I get a lot of games on Steam and I occaisionally get full triple A releases courtesy of my buddy Abe Lincoln.  That's five smackeroos for everybody keeping score.  For something that's so niche, so living on nostalgia, even for a perfect version (which this isn't), that's not okay.  For $10 I expect a full release (zing) for that sort of thing, not three skins.\n\nBottom line: if you can overcome that sizable problem or just play the free table, then Pinball FX2 might be as close as it gets to real pinball.   Otherwise, can't recommend.","March 4, 2015","false","6.3"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","10","21","2","0"

It comes with 1 free table you can play endlessly and there are a ton of extra tables you can get as downloadable content.

It's the best pinball game I have ever played and most tables fall somewhere between "really good" and "awesome" for me. I like that you can purchase only the tables you want (one of the only games in existence, where I think the DLC model makes a lot of sense). So if you are a fan of for example Star Wars, get one or two of the packs and have HOURS of fun with the tables. You like South Park? Get the two South Park tables... Honestly if you like the subject of a table you can hardly go wrong. And even tables based on stuff I didn't know before or didn't care for are almost all really enjoyable.\n\nThe only issue I had with it was the very long play times that could be achieved with reliable bang backs, that not only made the game a touch too hard, but were also required to master, if you wanted to have higher scores. But they changed that and now I am enjoying it just a touch more than before. ^^\n\nSo if you have only the faintest interest in video game pinball (and/or have played classics like Pro Pinball - Timeshock) do yourself a favor: stop reading here and try it.\n\nFor the rest, that want my opinion on why the latest reviews seem so negative read on:\n\nThe above mentioned "Bang-Back-Issue" is apparently a great source of anger in the forums and I don't really understand why it has to necessarily affect reviews of the game. I have watched a great deal of videos to get better at the game, but on some tables in particular it just seemed that the best score is achieved with a lot of dexterity playing the same shots over and over, while essentially having unlimited playtime, due to being able to really 100% bang back the ball. I didn't mind too much, since I personally could not do it all of the time so my playtime was in fact limited, but on the other hand did I not have any ambition to play for global high scores and when my friends lost intrest there was nobody to realistically beat anymore. xD I feel with the new changes and a bit of practice it would not be out of the question to reach maybe some High Scores (but time will tell ;P)\n\nHaven't heard of the unfair EULA thing that seems to be discussed here. It might be important to know and maybe it's not the best practice to change it after such a long time, but on the other hand they almost certainly reserved the right to change it and it doesn't change the fact, that the game is excellent. I just despise people playing something for like 500 hours and then "changing their opinion" to "not recommended"... New technical issues arrising or the game suddenly not working on the newest Windows 11 I could understand.\n\nAlso: get off your high horses with the developer "not listening to the community". First of all, I am pretty sure they do read a lot of the stuff that gets posted, second: just because YOU think an issue is present doesn't mean everybody else would be okay with the change or lack thereof (regarding the nudge debate). In the end it is the developers choice and if they want to reset the High Scores and change some internals, then they are going to do it. PERIOD\n\nYou have the choice to not buy future tables and just enjoy everything you have purchased thus far.","March 31","true","105.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Tables are made in nice interactive 3D graphics;  sound, physics and switching table-zones or with some extra taks makes each table unique.\nMy review: is NICE! - ZEN worked great on the tables - some are better some are less good. But s.th. that has gone very rare today: you can test the game on 1 table that is completely free and you can test every other DLC-table for at least 1 ball / a specific and small ammount of points.

On the plus side, it has the element of surprise much like the old school tables that sucked quarters in the 80s. You can DEMO all the tables, but there are so many now, you could miss out, so thought I would mention these as ones to check out for sure.\n\nSome tables become much more playable when you change the default angles and things, but you can't count those scores.\n\nI'd like to see something more done with the community on modding tables, or voting on what they'd like to see changed and competing on that "community table" of the month or something.","December 28, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

WIth the varity of tables, amazing physics & graphics, and endless replay value, this is one of my top games.\n\nMy previous experience with this game is a LOT of hours on Xbox, but I just got this on steam so that I could play on my monitor that tilts sideways for a better pinball experience.\n\nThe key for me to getting a lot of enjoyment from each a table is to learn the rules, tricks and storyline (but don't try to do it all at once) - over time you'll learn to progress the table's story and / or help rack up your points. Eventually you'll master a table and by that point you'll already be addicted. A single 3-ball game can last quite a while once you've mastered a table.\n\nIf you just aren't into a particular table, move to another. The table demos do a poor job of giving you a feel for how a game will play out over time, but at least you get an idea of the design. I purchased most of my tables based on reviews. A great first board is Epic Quest. A lot of players also love Fear Itself as a good starter table. By starter I don't mean they are "easy", it's just these boards are loved by a lot of players. Picking a dud as your first table could ruin your experience.\n\nThe table designs are mesmerizing. The game play is much deeper than you might imagine. Every time I load up a new board, it feels intimidating, but I try to just focus on passages and taking it step-by-step. I never just read through the entire table guide. I'll learn part of it, master it, and then move on to learn something new. Unlocking a table's secrets on your own is half the fun, and every single table is differnt.\n\nI'm truely amazed at the creativity behind each table layout. Some are hareder than others, some more rewarding, some more about story, some about scores, and in the end, everything comes down to just how you play a particular table.","December 27, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's compulsively satisfying, and offers new experiences with each board. It's unfortunate that each board or group of boards is a separate purchase.

Despite the fact that you need to buy tables separately, it's awesomely good. The physics are great, plus it doesn't try to be a fully realistic sim, so you get things like shooting blasters, balls changing physical properties, etc.\n\nThe only minus here is the low usefulness of table nudges. They don't influence the ball too much, and they have a very long cooldown, so it's very easy to tilt the table. (The best nudges IMHO were in Balls of Steel where one could play for a good while by using them and without using the flippers. :-) )\n\nI highly recommend it, even if only for the free table.","December 20, 2013","true","80.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sports is a common theme for actual pinball, and it is nice to Zen take a dip into that genre.  I jumped on the -50% price during the summer sale, and I am not disappointed.  For what is the price of 3 plays (at 0.50 ea),  You get a very original table that really puts you into the illusion that you are playing a game of football (soccer).  I like the fact that the table hinges on hitting mostly ramp shots instead of a lot of gimmicks, but it does a nice job of building up the pressure on you to score when the time is right.  You almost forget you are playing pinball but not in a bad way.  This is a great table, and it doesn't seem to matter which team you choose as they seem to be the same except for the colors and individual players named through the course of the game.","June 29, 2014","true","28.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does innovate, but it doesn't change what it is at it's core.\n\n+Endless replayable hi-score fun.\n+Original tables from the dev's with rich themes and additions that wouldn't be possible on a real table.\n+Graphics and sounds are what you would expect.\n+Leaderboards and stats galore.\n\n-From what I can tell, no real life tables. Those seem to be the focus of the other pinball game on steam, Pinball Arcade. Unfortunately, that game charges an insanely high amount for their table recreations - but that's exactly what they are, recreations of real tables, which is what Pinball FX2 lacks. My main gripe is that some tables made by Zen for Pinball FX are a little broken, whereas the tables in Pinball Arcade are based on real life tables which seem to be balanced better overall. The tables in Pinball FX2 are sold at a very fair price.","July 3, 2014","true","61.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of them was a little pinball game called "balls of steel" which had me playing for hours. Ever since i rarely saw any pinball games except for a few tiny titles every so often, none matching the quality and fun of a good pinball game. Then Pinball FX 2 appeared on steam and it was like i got a toy i always wanted as a kid, but never got.\n\nPinball Fx2 is a perfect pinball game that makes use of current tech (Yet not too much) to make for a fun game that can run on a wide scale of systems. Sure it aint perfect as on rare occassion a physics glitch occurs, but it comes far closer to perfect then any other title i know of.\n\nOnly real downside is the hefty price-tag if you are planning to get all Tables.","December 23, 2013","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You get to try every table so you can buy just the one's that you like. I also appreciate the different camera angles as I can always find one that I like. Effects are well done and I have yet to experience any glitches. The Number of choices is ridiculous. I personally would suggest the star wars pack, and zen pinball classics pack while I think that the paranormal table is too easy.\n\nMy biggest complaint with Pinball FX2 is the lack of cross-buy. Zen Studios has released the same tables on every device imaginable from OS X to Android, to PC, to the 3DS and to the Consoles, but if you buy a table on one platform you can't use it anywhere else. This is especially annoying as I use a macbook air and a windows desktop, but Pinball FX2 is only for windows.

Here are the Pros n Cons of this game\n****Pros****\n1) Graphics are really nice, it can run on high quality graphics on a low computer\n2) Controls are easy, and even better if you have an Xbox 360 controller\n3) The download is quick, maybe 30 min to an hour.\n4) Tables are cheap and quick to get, there are collections you can unlock for dirt cheap prices.\n****Cons****\n1) You get ONE free table, kinda sucks In my opinion, but they're cheap as i mentioned above.\n2) This is basically the same exact game as the Xbox has, just not with all the unlocked tables, if you want to spend $20 on a 360 game go ahead, otherwise get this game and buy only tables you want, for much cheaper prices.\nthat's what I got so far.

If you've got it in mode 1, there's no sea-sickness as it swooshes around. Try it. Even better if you lie it down somewhere too! (see my avatar for what I've been playing it on)\n\nMy Favourite table is the Plants Vs Zombies one.\n\n(Note: I got this game from Humble, and have been playing this in offline mode on a PC which is only ever connected to the internet if I'm downloading something, so the current time of 27 minutes isn't accurate.

The hulk table drives me nuts because of all the repeated talking he does, you will find out  its repeated every 2 minutes. Ugh. The hulk table is nice and I did enjoy it minus the voice talking.

Even if you never came in contact with the real thing you probably played the old pinball on Windows XP or at least heard about it right? No? WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE THAN? Real pinball works on a basic principle. You throw in a quarter and it usually gives you 3 balls to play with.\nYou are trying to not let the ball drain with your flippers while getting a score for anything you do. Once all your balls are lost, the game ends and you take place on the leaderboards. Sounds simple and it can be, depends how you look at it and what table are you playing.\n\nWhich brings us to this electronic pinball game. It's not going to ask you for quarters to play! In fact, it's like you have your own pinball machine at home where you just push start and you are given free balls to play with. But this thing is not going to cost you hundreds up to thousands of dollars and it's not going to take up a big space. This game will only take up space on your HDD and each table will cost you 2.99€ or your regional equivalent.\nThere's one free table for you to play with and every other table you can just try for free. The free table in question is Sorcerer's Lair and it's alot of fun! You'll find many hours of enjoyement on this free table alone and it will give you a good idea about how the game works and if it suits you.\n\nThe physics are very real, if it could be any closer to its real counterpart, it would be just scary. The speed might seem to be a bit too high but there are many realy tables that are even faster. This is still very fair but will make damn sure to test your fast hands out. Your ball can drain without you knowing what just happened, but that's the way it is. As you play more and more, you will eventually get better too.\n\nIf you are by a chance a fan of MARVEL or Star Wars, you are going to be happy as there are many tables in these themes. At the time of writing this there are 2 South Park tables, a Walking Dead table (based on the first game by telltale games), a plants vs. zombies table and many original design tables for you to choose from. Some are easy, some are hard, some are not worth getting as much as the others. But they are all quality products and you can really see that alot of hard work went into all of them. And as I said, you can "try before you buy" so you won't have to blindly buy into things you might not like in the end.\n\nThe community is really friendly and if you find yourself playing pinball FX2 alot, you might want to go check out an amazing steam group by the name of "Pinball Family" and ask for an invite. We are competing there each week on a different table, players of all skills!\n\nAll in all: if you are looking for a quallity electronic pinball, don't look any further, you found it! It's not going to cost you a fortune to play any table you'd like. The tables behave like the real thing and are filled with eye candy in form of 3D models that you wouldn't find on real tables... At least for now, once holograms are going to be a normal daily thing, you might find some 3D animated models in real pinball tables.","February 14, 2015","true","235.6"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","1"

How long can you keep Isaac Newton from laughing about your balls?\n\nThis.  This is my favorite game on Steam.  Pinball Arcade is just as good, but the currently impossible-to-manufacture tables that aren't trying to chew your quarters really lets your mind go to a zen state, and then a Logitech F310 or controller of choice becomes an extension of your consciousness.  Don't play for a high score, or for extra balls, the only one that matters is the last one on the table.  It's difficult to tell people what drives a person to play this game, but it's easy to recommend to everyone, if you are in the right mood to battle physics.\n\n9,5/10 equal to Pinball Arcade.\n\nPlay for fun, and keep this bit of trivia in mind: it costs $2 to play one game of pinball in real life.  Play a table in this game 100 times over the course of a year or more?  The value doesn't even make sense unless you remember being in an arcade with these competing with Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter.  Here, you don't have anyone judging your technique, there's a guide for every table a Start button or Esc key away explaining every detail you could ask about how to destroy a table.  Video guides if you have a friend you really want to beat, but your opponent is really yourself -\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy is a really energetic, fun table, and so is the South Park pack if you like the show.  The Walking Dead table is amazing if you've played the Telltale RPG series.","February 2, 2015","true","151.5"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","12","26","4","0"

My review is of the game itself and I have not played in several weeks so I was unaware of it. Check out some of the other reviews here or research a bit before downloading. I apologize for the outdated review.\n\nI'm 23. Though nowhere near old enough to have memories of arcade pinball machines, I am old enough to have nostalgia over virtual pinball games!\n\nSimple games are often the best in my opinion, and everyone knows how to play pinball. It is quite literally two buttons. Pinball is a concept any kid can understand. My free time after school often consisted of running home to play, of all things, Microsoft Windows Pinball. Looking back, it's amazing to me - a game that came free with our operating system had captured my attention for hours. On the go, I had 1999's Pokemon Pinball on my GameBoy Color. Now this one was more advanced - it had the Red table, and the Blue table (named after the Pokemon Red and Blue games), and they were different. I was amazed. I was addicted. I mentioned I like simplicity. To me, there is something to the objective of getting a high score. Challenging yourself, topping a friend's score, the way your heart starts beating fast as you realize you're edging in on a top score - these are some of the best feelings in gaming.\n\nPinball FX2 gets that. It understands the simplicity of the fun that comes from hitting a little silver ball around a table, trying to top that last score. It eggs you on. It notifies you when you're about to beat that score, or a friend's score.\n\nIt also understands my childish excitement when I saw Pokemon Pinball had two options for tables. It has dozens of tables, and I have yet to play one I didn't greatly enjoy. Zen has many original tables within the game, and there are some great licensed tables as well. You can find tables from the Marvel and Star Wars Universe. Some more series you will recognize are The Walking Dead, South Park, and Plants vs. Zombies. I will say Pinball FX2 is a bit heavy on the Marvel and Star Wars (so if you're not into those, there are a reduced number of tables you'll be interested in), but since you buy tables separately, you can just choose not to buy them. The quality and originality of every table has impressed me every time I try a new one, so even if you're not into the "lore" (as I'm not crazy on the Marvel universe), you may find the tables still well worth playing.\n\nHere is also a bit about the "pay structure" - the game is "free to play" technically. Everyone who downloads Pinball FX2 gets the Sorcerer's Lair table, which to be honest is a fantastic table you could entertain yourself on for hours. One of my favorites for sure. Anything else is sold separately, in "packs" (ie. the Star Wars and Marvel packs) or as individual tables. They are ALWAYS on sale during Steam sales so if you are eyeing a table but don't want to pay full price, I recommend just adding it to your wishlist and waiting!\n\nIf you love pinball games, give it a go. Try the free table, see what you think. There is something to kicking that little (virtual) ball around the table, which must be why I'm 23 and still playing the same game I was when I was 8.","March 5, 2015","true","34.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","2"

It is the destiny of every ball to be sucked into the mouth eventually.\nBut fear not friend, you are not defenceless, you can fight back.\n\nThey Call Him Flipper\n\nOn this tilted board of dreams you also have some interactive devices the pros like to call “flippers”\nAt the press of a button you can utilise these “flippers” in an attempt to intercept the rolling steel ball and change its path, hopefully away from the previously mentioned hole which is waiting to consume your ball.\n\nNice Pins\n\nIf that isn’t enough excitement for you, the table also has strategically placed targets which we’ll call pins.\nAlthough your primary objective should always be to avoid the devouring pit of doom at the base of the table, you also have the secondary goal of trying to hit the various pins with your mighty ball of steel.\nSo it’s a game of pins, balls and tables.\nIf you want to sound like a “real pro” you should refer to this pinned platform of perils as a “Pinball Table”\n\nPinball Wizard\n\nBut wait, there’s even more. The order in which you strike these “pins” can also be important.\nIf you strike the correct targets consecutively you may be awarded with additional points to help boost your score.\nThat’s right; the pinball table isn’t only there to confound you with its attempts to swallow your balls.\nYou can also quantify your prowess through the facility of a score.\nThis is where the true pinball wizards achieve their bragging rights.\n\nIf only there was some sort of training simulator\n\nSo, now you’re ready to master the mechanics of the fickle mistress that is pinball, but which game should you choose to hone your developing pinball powers?\nSurprisingly, when looking for the simulated experience of this seductive sport, you’ll find that the market isn’t exactly flooded with titles.\nSure, there are a few options out there, but if you’re serious about your pinball wizardry then the “go to” game at the time of writing is Pinball FX2 and best of all the price of admission is free.\n\nFree is Good\n\nMost of us can afford “Free”, in fact it’s my favourite price point for a game.\nSo what do you get for an investment of zero? A pretty well designed pinball table with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a digital version of the game, that’s what.\nAs well as the free table to cut your teeth on (which will likely give you many hours of game time on its own before you get bored), you also get the chance to enjoy a few minutes play time on many of the additional tables available to purchase in the game.\n\nMore Please\n\nWhen you do decide to move on from the starting table, the choice is vast, from the generically themed tables of Rome and Tesla through to Star Wars and The Walking Dead, you’re sure to find a table to suit your mood.\nThe additional tables are reasonably priced, and although you’ll undoubtedly have your own favourites, they are all of a high standard, expertly designed and fun to play (and yes, I’ve played through most of them)\n\nLet’s Get Physical\n\nThe physics in Pinball FX2  is spot on. The ball bounces around exactly as you’d expect it too, the motion is fluid, the flippers respond smoothly and no matter how frantic the action gets, everything rolls along nicely.\n\nMaster your Balls\n\nPinball FX2 is an outstanding title in the genre; it sounds good, it looks amazing and it plays better than the real thing.\nThere’s a score table out there waiting to put your name up in lights.\nIt is time for the student to become the master.\n\nGo now, Show the world what you can do with your balls!\n\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","February 24, 2015","true","55.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

What helps to set this apart from other pinball simulators is that the game is not limited to things that are possible on real tables, such as character interaction or varying minigames, also the wide array of licensed tables (mostly from Mavel and Star Wars) might be a draw.\n\nThe biggest downside i've seen of this game so far is that the game is sold in pieces, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes. There are various packs, single table purchases, and bundles to choose choose from that it might be overwhelming, but the game does allow for you to demo every table for a few moments. Also because this is how the game is set it, its constantly reminding you of the content you do not own.\n\nThere is also a ton of customization options from graphical settings to viewing angles that you can find the layout that works best for you. Sadly, this version of the game is missing its online multiplayer component, leaving the only form of competition you can have up to various leaderboards that can be in general or between your Steam friends.\n\nUltimately if you need one Pinball game, this one can do the job nicely between its feel and wide table variety, just dont be weary of the game being sold in pieces.\n\nDISCLAIMER: There is apparently some nasty documentation with the wording in the End User License Agreement that could allow the game to be updated to serve as spyware on your PC. I have done some research before I ever downloaded the game and discovered the game itself (as of this review) does not do this at all. Zen Studio's also recieved a big enough backlash that they said they'd ammend the EULA some time ago but have yet to for reasons unknown. I am personally confident both developer Zen Studio's and publisher Microsoft Studio's would not be so foolish at this point in time to gather untold information outside of the game itself at this point.\n\nIf the presense of this info on the EULA still is making you uneasy or you do not wish to keep tabs on this situation, i'd remomend just waiting until the EULA is altered to either remove that portion entierly or to adjust it to clearly state they are only gathering background information in-game on your   usage and purchase habits(in the context of providing a better service or selection to its users).","January 4","true","4.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","4"

A quarter bought you 5 balls and 2 of them, bought you 3 games. Pool Halls are where you found a few machines to slap the ears and knee the coin box of your favorite machine. Yes I am that old. That being said...\n\nI have been extremely unimpressed with video recreations of pinball until now. Pinball FX2 hits the the target @ the bullseye. Zen has captured the heart of pinball in this version. The physics are spot on. The ball reacts to the flippers near perfectly. Trick shots, and saves can happen just like in real life. The ball can drain straight down the center or to the side just like the real thing.\n\nThe tables....\n\nI own 12 tables as I wtite this review. I pick my tables based on playing the demo version that the game allows. I have played real life tables since the days they where more mechanical then electronic. I can tell enough, from the demo's all of the tables are heavly tested, not just for skill level but play style as well. I have found several tables that meet my taste. If you enjoy pinball you will find something in your flavor as well.\n\n\nPRO's:\nNo quarters lost at the arcade.\nPhysics are spot on. Ball behaves very much like real life pinball.\nFlippers are responsive, and won't wear out with time.\nFull controller support (Highly Recommend)\nTables are exciting and themed.\nTables are well tested for playability.\nGame is highly polished.\nAdjustable screen orientation. (portrait mode)\nPossible to demo tables before buying.\n\nCON's:\nNo glass pops or free game pops.\nSome tables may be a little busy or flashy.\nNo old school tables. with more targets, slots, pockets, or bumpers.\nSome of the camera follows can be abrubt and distracting.\nDemo's shorter then I want. (but aceptable)\nSome tables not available outside of packs.\nStart screen displays all availabe DLC.\n\nMy only peeve, is the my last con. I don't want to be told my collection is incomplete, if I don't want that table. There should be a tab to display available content. I only want to see my own collection on the title screen.

Its pinball. but its one of the best virtual pinball games i've ever played.  It has a sleek presentation, and the game play and physics feel really good.  and since its not a reality the table aren't bound by physical limitations so you can have things like people flying around the table or explosions that add to the presntation and polish.  I also like how even with these larger than life elements it still feels like pinball. no stupid gimicks. just a ball and flippers.\n\nNow i'm talking about the over all experince here.  Some tables in the game are better than others and that will vary depending on what kind of pinball elements you like and how appealing a particlar tables theme is to you.  but reguardless there are a large variety of table you can purcahse and each one is will have the same level of quality, polish and presentation.\n\nIf you need your pinball fix this is a good option","June 22, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'll keep this review short since it's just pinball and quite frankly there's little to say, but anyone interested in having a solid arcade feeling pinball experience should get this game.\n\nPROS\n\n\n\nFun\n\n\nGood Selection of tables\n\n\nSolid Feeling Controls, everything feels responsive and you never feel like you missed a ball thanks to a delayed flipper or anything else.\n\n\nMultiple table aesthetics to suit anyone's taste. Want an underwater themed table? It's there. Want a wild west themed table? It's there. Want a space themed table? It's there.\n\n\nMultiple camera angles to play around with so anyone can adjust the camera to their playstyle if they want a larger view of the table or just want to follow the ball. Plus they look cool and can be used to switch things up if it gets boring.\n\n\nThe music and sounds for each table are nice\n\n\nIt looks pretty\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n\nThe game gives you one free table but you'll quickly get bored of that and want to buy some other tables which frankly feel like a rip. Most tables are three dollars which isn't that bad for the amount of quality you get with these tables, but still feels a little bit too expensive. I would just drop 10$ on the core pack which gives you some of the best tables in the game and buy the others which seem of interest to you. While not a big flaw for a free game, it's something to consider.\n\n\n\nMany of the tables are promotional tables for Star Wars, Marvel, or Football(Soccer to us Americans). While no-one is forcing you to buy these tables, they take up the majority of Tables offered by the shop and seem to be a lesser quality than most other tables. This could just be my personal preference, but the Venom table is my least touched table out of all the tables I own. I hear the Football(Soccer) tables are weird also.\n\n\nLack of Windowed mode. This is really a game that needs windowed mode, but lacks it\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any interest in Pinball or are a Pinball enthusiast pick this game up, you wont be disappointed.","May 19, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Some of the most enjoyable tables are your own (Paranormal, Sorcerer's Lair, Epic Quest).\n\nTables with IP's sell much better I'm sure, but It would be awesome if we got another original once in a while!\n\nThanks for making a great game!","November 30, 2015","true","56.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Pinball FX2 is a great example of very cool pinball-simulators. Although the itself is free, you have to buy pinball tables first, because that's only way to actually play the game. But don't worry, those pesky microtransactions are wourth your money. The tables go around 3 bucks, and a collection of tables goes for 7 bucks (a few tables) to 11 bucks (around 5 tables). I recommend buying the Portal-, Football/Soccer-, Marvel-, and cartoon-tables (South Park, Family Guy, et cetra).

Zen decided to ninja an update that destroyed all saves across all tables and didn't warn the community ahead of time, even though it was known it would destroy saves. The condescending pop-up message confirms this.\nTop it off with the random crashes means you don't have a lot to look forward to other than frustration and wasting your time.\n\nThe direction of all the new tables is this: Disney / Marvel. Zombies.    Don't expect much else. It's clear that the team has given up trying to be original, and like, say, Hollywood, just rehashes others' ideas, believing it will get a bigger response based on nostalgia and moronic fanboy response.\nSpeaking of fanboys...\nThe community has some good people but don't expect much give and take. Don't expect to be critical of anything without a bevy of uninvited losers with pacman avatars to go all fanboy attack on your comments / screenshots / whatever.\n\nThis is ultimately the fallout of the fun in the game, in the long term. The people get annoying and if you don't tow the company's line, you will be bashed. Not by everyone, but you can't get away from the truly douchey people.\n\nQuality is hit or miss on the newer tables;  i.e. the Star Wars line are poorly exectued with a couple of exceptions and I expect this general trend to continue, as they seem to be going for style over substance.\n\nDo not buy. Pinball Arcade is a decent alternative for now.\n\n","July 26, 2014","false","356.5"," 22 of 48 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","22","48","0","15"

The tables also all suffer from strange bumps from the slingshots and sometimes the tip of the flippers that fire the ball right down the centre out-ramp (drain) before any reaction can be made; they try to address this problem with a ball save feature, but it happens too often and quickly becomes demoralizing. Also, the scoring feels "off" or disproportionate and takes forever to get a score above 10 million on any of the tables. The only success I've had is with the free table and I had to play for almost an hour to get 230 million and it became more of a chore than fun. Once I got that high score I "retired" the table and haven't played it since. The graphics are amazing, stunning even, but flashy graphics does not a good game make. I found Pinball Arcade to be have generally better physics and game-play. I won't be spending any more money on this game.","March 20, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Each time a table is added to Pinball FX2, the size of the downloaded content increases by the size of the added table. This is because all of the tables are fully present so you can test them with certain restrictions (like time penalties, bonus penalties, etc.))\n\nMany of the tables are "enhanced" with features and elements that would be impractical or impossible on a physical pinball table, making them seem like more an evolution of pinball into "Pinball with added CGI" than what you'd find in a pinball emulator, which attempts to recreate exactly the pinball experience of imaginary or real-life pinball machines.  Some are based upon established concepts, like comics, superheroes, Star Wars, TV series, or other video games. Others are original concepts.\n\nFortunately, you can download this game and play either Sorcerer's Lair, one of the early Pinball FX2 tables, absolutely free and unlimited in its accessibility, or you can try the other games it offers for a limited time per session (although it's been long enough since I last played Pinball FX2 that restrictions for unlicensed content might have changed).\n\nAll tables, from what I've noticed, allow you, as the owner of the table, to access options presumably available to owners of actual arcade pinball machines who want to tweak their tables to bring in the most tokens or attract the highest number of players, allowing you to test the table's lights, in sections and individually, adjust difficulty, listen to sounds, change the simulated angle of the table, the weight of the balls, number of plays per credit, score listings, set it for free play, and many, many other things, as well as view the number of games played, balls played, time per ball, number of times the different kickbacks on the table have been activated in play and while what ball or feature was active, how many credits inserted, extra balls awarded, and basically get a very detailed statistical report of what has occurred with the virtual pinball table in your imaginary arcade since it was installed or since the last time you reset the table's statistics.\n\nAdjusting the options to something other than default will often disqualify your scores for inclusion on the leaderboards or for reception of some/all achievements for as long as the relevant option(s) are set to non-default setting(s).\n\nThe Pinball FX2 description says the included, unlocked Sorcerer's Lair table is without restrictions with "no timed free play session, no ads, no gimmicks."\n\nPlaying solo as I do, I have often noticed the many multiplayer benefits Pinball FX2 offers (because playing solo means I either don't appear in the listings or I'm the only player in the listings). You can play against your real-life in-person friends on the same machine in hotseat mode (like a real table), your Steam friends, or, apparently, friends you know on social networking sites, trying to best their high scores, times, achievements, etc., or merely pit yourself against the rest of the worldwide community (if you have no gamer friends who play this game or own the same tables you enjoy).\n\n(end of review 1.0)\n\nNOTE:From what I'm reading in the other reviews about the newest End User License Agreement, Pinball FX2 desires to access your social profiles for access to your linked friends and associates and IP address and device specs and location and likes and anything else that can be used to target "tailored" ads at you for advertising while you're playing the (hopefully UNowned) tables. Because I wouldn't link this game to any social networking sites I access, I don't see this as much of a problem. However, I have not yet read this "new 05-2015 EULA" so I can't comment more regarding whether I object to this "snooping" more than in principle. Is principle alone enough to give up a game which provides quite a bit of fun? Maybe, if it's as intrusive as some reviewers are claiming it is. Maybe not. I'll have to read the new EULA before I decide whether to change my initial review.","June 3, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

In fact the only ones I did play were 20 years ago on my Amiga (Pinball Fantasies, Pinball Dreams and Pinball Wizard). However, recently I bought a couple of Pinball FX2 tables in a humble bundle. I have played 5 tables so far. Here are my impressions.\n\nThe good is:\n- It's free! You can try one table and then decide if you want more.\n- There are a lot of different tables available in wide range of styles.\n\nThe bad is:\n- Paying for each table feels like a collectible game.\n- The difference between the tables is mostly cosmetic. This is probably an inherent problem of pinball itself.\n- The sound effects, especially the ones containing movie quotes and such, get old very quickly.\n- However, the most important problem for me is that FX2 does not feel like a real pinball table. The ball is seemingly weightless as it makes no sound when it touches a wall and it sometimes changes direction in an unrealistic way.\n- Also, there is a noticeable delay between pressing the button and the flippers moving, which is the worst problem a game like this can have. How can you mess up controls that basically consist of two button?\n\nAll in all I would not recommend the game. Feel free to try it, but be critical and remember that the other tables are not that different from the free one.","December 4, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

This is one of my favorite games on Xbox 360, so when I got my PC hooked up with Steam, I had to get it.\n\nSome of the games are better than others, just like real pinball machines. However, I've aways felt that Zen Studios has put more effort into the graphics and effects and on some games I wonder if anyone has actually played the game to see what it played like. Some of the tables seem like they are designed to last thirty seconds, when a ball goes down the tubes without a flipper play, I mean, how much fun is that? Also, there are bugs and gameplay problems that are never fixed and never will be. If an FX2 table comes out with a bug, it will never be fixed. High scores jave been deleted weekly from leaderboards and in the rare tournament that they have, the results may deleted and never posted again. Zen Studios say they are a small studio and are working as hard as they can, but problems are never fixed. Never.\n\nI've only played FX2 on Steam for about an hour, but it's enough to know I won't be buying any more tables than I already have. First off, there is no windowed mode. I can't move the game from my computer monitor to my HDTV. FX2 has great graphics, probably the best thing about the game, but when you play on a small screen, you can's see anything. I have a 23" 1920 x 1080 computer monitor, too many details to see clearly, the game would be way better at 1080p or 720p on a 32" HDTV. Also, the Microsoft wireless controller is disconnected from the game at random, so forget using a MS wireless controller.\n\nIf you are a pinball junkie like I am and you are willing to play with a keyboard and hunch over your computer desk with your face a foot away from a 23" widescreen computer monitor, then I recommend Pinball FX2. If you have never played pinball before and grew up playing computer games, as much as it pains me to say so, I would not recommend FX2 unless they fix it up, which their track record says they will not do.\n","December 4, 2014","false","3.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","2"

It's not pinball for pinball fans, it's pinball for fans of other things who want a "themed pinball" experience that is forgiving, simplistic, outrageous/action packed, full of unrealistic special effects, and not comparable to real pinball in any way except in appearance and scoring. Inaccurate but predictable ball physics and poorly designed levels mean you can spend 30 minutes racking up a high score doing the exact same things over, and over, and over, and over, only to find out not only is it not a high score, but there are dozens of pinball losers out there that have played the table for LITERALLY DAYS, 24+ HOURS, to get a score so ridiculous you wonder what the point of the game might be? It isn't fun for very long, it's VERY repetitive (you get bored frequently long before you run out of balls), there's no real target to shoot for scorewise, and there are maybe 5 good tables out of the 40 or whatever that are available. Oh, and the tables: weird, weird stuff. More than half the tables are superhero themed, Marvel and such, I don't know for sure I'm a pinball fan not a comic book fan. Also a lot of Euro Football Club (FC) themed tables were just added recently. I don't know, I'm not a football fan, I'm a pinball fan. There's a Plants vs Zombies table, but I'm not a PvZ fan... I'm a pinball fan. Seeing a trend?\n\nUPDATE 10/9/2014: This week Pinball FX2 got a 3.2gb patch that added Stereo Sound. Yup, stereo sound for 3.2gb, with still no update for multi monitors, physics, pincab setups, or a huge list of other things the community has demanded for years. Deleted. For good this time.\n\nUPDATE 6/1/2015: HAHAHAHAHAH @ this new EULA. Signing away all your rights to privacy, agreeing to 3rd party targeted advertising, giving Zen unlimited freedom to do anything they want with every piece of information you supply to them while using this game or your pinball account, and even forcing you to agree to 3rd party advertising privacy policies JUST TO PLAY THE GAME?

There is one 'free' table which changes occasionally (every month or so) and there are 21 other tables to play which lock you out after 60 seconds or 500,000 points.  When the trial is over, you are prompted to buy the board or get kicked out.\n\nMicro transactions are the pits.\n\nThe paddle controls are wooden and the responsiveness of the tables leaves a lot to be desired (Just don't tilt.)  Honestly, if you are looking for a quick game of pinball, then this 1.5GB monstrosity, which is marked as ‘free’, isn’t it.\n\nThe only positive elements to mention are the single "free" board, which is not terrible.  Purchasing the 'add-on' boards would get expensive quickly.  This is too bad really because the trial boards look interesting but 60 seconds isn't enough time to even get a feel for them and is really just frustrating.\n\nI can't recommend this game, sorry.","July 27, 2013","false","2.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

For one of the simplest examples the left shift smacker only works half of the time and when it does actually realise you pressed the button it is somehow lagged and will likely miss the ball. Other than that "now at this point I may be getting nitpicky but if you actually take the time to read this far hopefully you won't mind" there is enough going on at the board while playing at a time to warrent a seizure warning " think I may have actually saw one on a later thought". Seriously, to keep up with whats going on and get anything decent of a score you would have to have for a lack of better terms super human eyes. Other that that on my playthrough I realised that considering this I had no time to read the paragraphs of writing on the board I was just trying to make sure I kept up with the ball its all luck untill you've played your heart out enough countless hours to know how each event actually works. In short my many many attempts at Sorcerers Lair were as you can all now guess very frustrating having a left clicker that only works if pressed just right and lag time must be taken into consideration also trying to read what the board said was useless because by the time I've read one sentence Ive already lost the ball. And yes I know that you can take time to read over the board before shooting the ball for all those of you out there that will likely argue this for ages but lets be honest here, this is pinball, pinball. Are you really going to sitdown and spend the anywhere between 25 and 50 hours to get a grasp for one board and how it works. To summarize that idea it's not fun when you have to put more effort into your pinball knowledge than that of even the most extensive video game lore such as Skryim, nobody wants to spend the time it took them "or at least I normally dont" to learn the lore of a fallout game or elder scrolls raging at a pinball game. In the end though if you like challenging game and I mean like pull your hair out get up and scream at the computer for not seemingly loading the game fast enough for you to hit that perfect ball just right, this is your game, get it, play it, rage it, then become annoyed like I did and write a rant about it in you'r spare time.","January 2, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

It costs over $40 to buy complete, as it is offered one table at a time. The better tables cost as much as a complete 3-years old game on sale whereas the not so good tables are cheaper. And now for the bad news.\n\n\nProblem No.1: the perspective is all wrong and there is no way to fix it. The back half of the table (including the back flippers in most cases) are hidden from view. You hear sounds, you see some movement yet you have no idea what's going on. There are ways to give a forced 3D view to a simulated pinball table; unfortunately the developers missed the ball in all of them ;).\n\nProblem No.2: the physics are screwed up. A pinball game is by definition a game of split-second decisions and unpredictability (yet consistent) gravitomagnetic reactions. So, I cannot imagine how anyone can claim of having fun with a pinball game that is inconsistent in its physics.\n\nProblem No.3: the graphics are forcibly low and the resolution is not modifiable. A barely playable game that is not even a eye-candy?\n\nI am sorry but I cannot recommend this to anyone. Microsoft’s Space Cadet (not to mention Austin Powers Pinball) were far better pinball games.

WRONG!\n\nThis game is pretty much gaming heroin, it's got me well and truly hooked, and that is the only reason i continue playing. And i mean the ONLY reason, because despite having all the DLC tables, i vehemently detest every second i'm playing this thing. This game subjects you to unbearable frustration unlike any other. For every go you enjoy because you do well, there are around 50 goes where it makes you look and feel like you've never started the game before, you do so badly. Yes there is skill involved, but also huge amounts of luck. The number of times a potential new best score is terminated because the ball gets shot straight into an out-lane or straight between the central flippers without you having the chance to do a single thing is ridiculous. In my 150+ hours i have NEVER, not once, had a go where at least one ball wasn't totally wasted.\n\nIf you do something crazy, like... oh i dunno... actually not play this game for 1 day, then that is long enough to ensure you become so rusty you play like a total first-timer. Or if you do something truly masochistic, like play this game every day, it will still go in cycles so you once again go back to playing like a total first-timer. Except, of course, now you have your own personal high scores that show to you how well you should be at this game, as you struggle to barely reach 5% of that high score in your next 50+ attempts.\n\nThis game is NOT fun, it is NOT enjoyable, but you WILL constantly play it because it hooks you almost immediately. The base game with first table is free and you can try all other available tables for a short time before buying them as DLC's. But spare yourself endless frustration and don't try it! I hate this game with a passion and wish i had never found it on here!\n\nAnd before people comment saying i only hate this game because i'm crap at it, with only 2 exceptions every one of my high scores on all current tables (so on 41 of the 43 tables at the time of writing) are within the top 10%, so my intense loathing of this game is nothing to do with me being crap at it.","July 26, 2013","false","177.6"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nemecks/recommended/226980/","nemecks","Nemecks. Timelord.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nemecks/","456 products in account","I've always loved pinball. As a child, I'd always gravitate to them and feed as many quarters in their gullet as my parents would provide. I loved the sounds, the feel of the flippers, the glittering LED screens and flashing lights. The time was over too quickly. So when I saw the free-to-play Pinball FX2 hit Steam, I downloaded it immediately.\n\nIt's easy to understand the notion of FX2: a digital platform for tables that are too fantastical for the real world. It's a great idea. But it doesn't quite deliver. The tables are imaginative, bright and colorful, and sometimes unique. Something is missing, though. Something that's hard to explain. I think it all boils down to three main problems: sound, physics, and table design.\n\nPart of the splendor of pinball is the pings, pongs, bings, clanks, and bangs of the steel bearing flying around the arena. In large part, those tiny sounds are simply not present. You hit a target, and you hear nothing. Some flippers don't flip. The ball pangs off of a bumper, and the sound is stunted and dull. Even the ball itself sounds like a hollow piece of hardwood. It's not right. It's not the pinball I know.\n\nThe sound is bad, but the physics add another layer of non-realism to the escapade. The ball tends to accelerate too quickly. When it hits a lower bumper, it barely makes it to the adjacent. It's as if the ball itself is tired. If you hit a ramp without enough speed, there's no hangtime. It almost immediately reverses direction and comes back at you with full force. It feels completely wrong.\n\nThe tables generally look spactacular at first glance. Characters are animated, the lights are in the right places, and there are decorative nuances that look great. It's mostly window dressing. Once the ball is launched, you immediately notice problems. Most tables lack a proper skillshot, or the ball simply shoots across the table into a boring location only to be flipped back up into a myriad of lazy ramps. And boy do the designers love ramps. Several tables are almost completely composed of them. Ramps are a core part of pinball, but there needs to be balance. You need targets, flippers, spinners, bumpers, and above all: goals.\n\nAll of the tables have goals. They are just hard - or frustrating - to find. They need to be more obvious. It's no fun to throw the ball around for 10 minutes without hearing a single mission from the horribly acted announcers. When you manage to find one, they don't pay off. There's no feel of advancement.\n\nI had high hopes. Probably too high. Pinball FX2 didn't deliver.\n\nThere is a game, though, for my fellow pinball fans: Pinball Arcade (also on Steam). You get one table free and are able to try any of the rest until you hit a reasonable score cap. Each table is painstakingly digitalized from a real, beloved machine. And it shows. The care taken into recreation is obvious at every turn. The physics are -perfect-. The tables, in general, are a complete blast to play. The snippets of history attached before you play a table makes you fully understand the attention the developers put into the game of pinball. They love it in real life and wanted to express it digitally. They fully succeeded. The tables are pricy, but entirely worth the money.\n\nPlay Pinball Arcade. Don't play FX2.","November 25, 2013","false","1.7"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","1"

I could not launch it even once on a brand new gaming laptop with 16gb of RAM and two graphics cards. The install forces you to install Uplay junk which crashes the game before the first play.

Everything abou ♥♥♥ is excellent but for one thing - there's a minor delay between when you hit the button and when your paddles flip. Not much. Maybe a fraction of a second.

You can only play one table. That's it. Just one. At least Pinball Arcade also threw in a free table you could play for a month. But this one gives you no sort of freebie. And the one table you CAN play is rather bleh IMO.\n\nI played the table a couple times and it got boring quickly. The voices are obnoxious and the music was kinda bland. Sure there were extra "mini tables" but I got ejected back to the main table before I could even figure out what I was supposed to do! Give me a redo for the love of God!\n\nThe fact that all of the tables cost over $100 just makes me want to bang my head on a wall. I could use that money to buy all the games on my Wishlist and still have money left over!\n\nAll I want out of Steam is a non-demo free game that doesn't contain microtransactions to unlock other features. I'm very low on funds and I'm trying to use it wisely, but is a Steam game that doesn't ask for money every five seconds too hard to make? If you want a decent Steam pinball game, go with Pinball Arcade. Not this Marvel-whoring, money-grabbing game.","March 11, 2014","false","0.6"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"
