There's no option to invert the mouse, by the way, and the top end resolution on the game well below what a modern monitor can use.  All in all, it feels (and looks) like a PS2-era game.

I blew them up. I may not have the right to speak since I haven't completed the game fully yet but i have 2 hours into the game with 3 more levels to go. Jeez thats a 3 hour game. But the length of the game is good considering you will not want to play any more after the first hour. The fun moments are there when you blow stuff up with some new tank shells/bullets but besides that and a couple of new enemies this game lacks gameplay variety. One tank and 8 boring levels with some fun moments to be had. 2 of those levels are 20 minute survival missions that rot your brain cells with the same respawning enemies for 20 minutes. Its short 3 hours and a boring 3 hours. Its a good thing I got this game for free. "10/10 Its ok. Needs more hotdog trucks."

Don't expect any tactics, deep gameplay or interesting missions: what you see in the first minutes is all you get: now, this'd be good for some if the gameplay was at least decent but sadly it has a plethora of problems.\n\nFor starters the tank controls very badly as it slides around, has no traction, an huge turning circle and will stop abruptly if you hit a small slope or a wooden sign:  its turret also can't rotate 360 degrees making it difficult to properly engage enemies behind you. The awkward controls are paired with sections where you need to zigzag between mines or ostacles (sometimes under fire) and this gets annoying fast. The camera also moves jerkily whenever you hit something of a different height and this can get either confusing or downright nausea inducing.\n\nPair the aforementioned problems with a lack of enemy variety- all sporting a braindead AI- and extremely repetitive missions and you'll easily see how Desert Thunder is a dull, forgettable experience that you can safely skip.","November 26, 2015","false","1.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

And yet, it's weirdly enchanting in its terribleness.\n\nSo the weird thing about it is the fact that it kind of works well, but at the same time, really doesn't. The graphical quality is reminiscent of the Playstation era, and the control handling is fraught with override problems. The handling is made worse by mines that you can't shoot, but that you can see clearly, hill climbing that somehow works sometimes and not others on much less steep hills, troops that shoot a neverending barrage of rockets at you, but are ridiculously difficult to hit, enemy tank AI that oftentimes just plain doesn't work at all, and resolution choices that don't work with 16:9 displays. Sufficed to say, this game is kind of terrible. Something kept me playing it through two levels, but that's time I'd really like to get back somehow.","May 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

Really bad. The basic gameplay mechanics are there. Movement, shooting, enemies, different kind of destructable enviroments and... well, to be honest that's pretty much it. There's really nothing to the game other than moving, shooting enemies and different kinds of obstacles.\n\nIf I can sum up the whole game into a couple of sentences it pretty weak game.

Controls are fine and I am not even a person that likes drive vehicles in games.  In regards to AI well if you sit around in range the tanks will hit you and as for the guys firing off rocket launchers they mean business.  They are accurate with their shots.  Oh and when you hit the enemy their deaths are rewarding despite the older graphics.  The soundtrack to me totally fits the game and is a plus.  The destructable environment is nice and hey if you hit a landmine you are going to feel in terms of being damaged.  I think this game is a nice game to have in my library as it straight up gives me something different from other games I have.  I think this would be a nice addition to others gaming libraries too.  Now as for what I would pay for it well I think it is all up to the person and quite frankly I don't want to put a price on the fun I had.

Released in 2003, this jawdropping Unreal Engine-powered masterpiece boasts unmatched excellence in virtually all categories - graphics, gameplay, soundtrack, story, cinematics - you name it. This is definitely a game that you will not regret buying. It is worth every single penny you could possibly throw at it, and then some. It is quite simply an amazingly unforgettable experience.","September 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","43","9","21","6","0"

The shooting pipe of the tank disappears under the tank, if you aim too low.\n- The tank itself looks like a damn shoebox and drives that way.\n- The mission are just play boring...drive from point a to point b and survive the stupidity...","January 6","false","0.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Although this game has quite some age, being released in late 2003, it is a very HIGH QUALITY game. It consists of high intensity, strategy, and lots of patience. This game should only be tacked by the top of the line gamers. If you're not a huge gamer, don't even worry! I'd still recommend purchasing this wonderful game. Overall, this is one of my favorite games, tied with Desert Gunner (which if you don't already own, you should purchase as well). Seeing as the price is right for only $9.99, I encourage all steam users to purchase this game. If I had to rate this game out of 10, I would give it a rating of atleast 10, if not beyond such as an 11 or 12. It is very exciting and gets you wanting to play for hours on end. This game is very addicting and great to play amongst your family and friends when together. Although it isn't multiplayer, it is a great way to have fun with friends whether you are with eachother in real life, over the phone, or on an online chatting mechanism such as Skype or Teamspeak. Once again I highly encourage all steam users to purchase this game. The graphics are great, the controls are on point, and the fun is non-stop.\n\nHurry! Don't wait, you never know when prices might go up. And if you already haven't checked out my Desert Gunner review, please do so.\n\nGreat development from BrainBox Games. Well planned out. Much better than many games which have recently been published and released.","June 17, 2014","true","4.6"," 8 of 46 people (17%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","17","8","46","3","0"

Riveting gameplay and gripping soundtrack! Simply amazing. Something like Ori and the Blind Forest can't even compare!\n...\n...\n...\nOkay, I'm gonna be honest. It physically pained and sickened me to say that. Even as a joke. This game, even if it is from 2003, is simply not good. Especially for a game that costs $9.99. "Why?" I hear you ask. Well, let's start with the basics. For one, the controls are extremely laggy. As soon as I launched the game, the cursor would get stuck constantly, making the experience on the main menu terrible. Second, upon opening the game, I was greeted with sub-par textures and extremely low-poly models. To top it all off, the "soundtrack", if you can even call it that, sounds like it came straight from an early 2000 game. Not only is the quality absolute ♥♥♥♥♥, it is just generic in every respect.\n\nNow, onto the more detailed parts of the game. The gameplay is basic, and not in a good way. You are dropped straight in, and instructed to kill everything. No side objective, no rules of engagement, just kill. This wouldn't be a problem if it was done properly. The enemies are brain dead, and you can take excessive amounts of damage. Even if you do take damage, it will all regenerate within two or three seconds. Max. Also, infinite ammo for all! As far as game functionality is concerned, don't expect much. This game's port is utter garbage. The game crashes very frequently, and the game occasionally freezes.\n\nStay away from this game. I got it for free, and I regret getting it.","November 16, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is very cliché with no redeeming qualities.\n\nLet’s jump straight into the problems:\n\nThe menu. The mouse is sporadic and gets “stuck” on random parts of the screen. I’ve never seen anything like this in a game before. There’s no way this wasn’t noticed before releasing.\n\nThe controls. The tank has sluggish controls with an annoyingly huge turning radius. Going in reverse while turning doesn’t reverse the controls (like backing up a car) so you have to unnaturally keep holding the direction you want to go while backing up. Also, the turret DOES NOT turn 360 degrees. What kind of experimental tank design is that? It really hinders the ability to shoot enemies.\n\nThe gameplay. It’s terrible. There are 8 missions total. Two…Two of which are 20 minute forced defense missions where you go around in the same loop shooting the same guys until the timer runs out. The other missions have you driving through the desert shooting tanks and people until you reach the end. After the first mission I realized you didn’t even need to shoot anything that doesn’t immediately block your path. Just keep driving until you reach the end, that’s it. The gameplay is also extremely repetitive. Play the first level, you’ve played them all. Same enemies, same tanks.\n\nThe game tries to mix it up adding power-ups along the way to your machine gun and turret. They do adjust the damage of your gun, but I never bothered to get them after initially trying them out. The terrible tank controls combined with the small hitbox for the power-ups just leads to frustration. Hitting enemies with your regular gun does just fine.\n\nThe AI. It’s bad. Sometimes they’ll notice you, sometimes you have to hit them first until they engage you. Even the final boss tank is laughably easy. Funny enough, the hardest enemy in the game are the mines! They are generally hard to see and deal a ton of damage. Watch out for those :)\n\n\nPros\n+Short (trust me, this is good)\n+Voice acting isn’t terrible\n+Bullet drop gives some strategy to the game\n\nCons\n+Glitchy mouse in menu\n+Bad controls\n+Terrible gameplay\n+Two 20 minute forced levels out of 8 total levels\n+Repetitive enemies and level design\n+Bad AI\n+Cliché and empty story\n\nProbably the worst offense this game has is the price. The current $9.99 price is insane. Stay away from this game. If you must have it, wait for it in a bundle or free giveaway.\n\n2/10\n","January 18","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
