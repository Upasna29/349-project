Period. It's a top notch third-person shooter involving zombies, monsters, and biological weapons. I'll be the first to admit, RE6 is lacking big time as far as the "throw back" factor is concerned. However, I appreciate what they're doing here. I personally love the whole lay-on-your-back-and-frantically-shoot-enemies feature. I also like that I can actually melee instead of swipe the air in front of me with a knife hoping to make contact. I agree that having to wait for the zombies to move before I can shoot them is lame, and I had a bit of a struggle adapting to the assault rifle zombie (though he really just holds down the trigger in sporadic bursts that go all over, mostly hitting the ground). The J'Avo are NOT zombies. They are bio-weapons, superhumans if you will. They sometimes transform into other creatures. This I can accept. I had to adapt to RE6's gameplay. I do things like turn on a high difficulty and pace myself. Do I HAVE to walk down that hall with my gun drawn? Well, no. But I do because that creates more tension and I can take in the atmosphere more.\n\nI was skeptical at first about Wesker's son Jake. It seemed pretty cliche and silly to me. Then I remembered that the entire story of all of them is. Again, this is not to say I don't like all the others, I love them. But honestly, the dialogue and voice acting has always been pretty bad. That's just one of the things that I fell in love with back then (along with tank controls!). Jake's story even has a Nemsis theme throughout, but that still isn't enough for some folks. Also, by the time I got to the second chapter of Leon's campaign (three hours in) there was some extensive puzzle solving. However, they do baby you through them via pop ups and quest markers. My solution? Turn off the HUD. It clears the screen up and makes the game more approachable. I don't feel like I shouldn't have to do that, rather I appreciate the option to do so.\n\nIt's things like these that I think offend some old school RE fans. I guarantee the last time 90% of the people complaining about the new gameplay mechanics played RE1, 2, or 3 was at least 3 years ago when they got upset about RE5, if not longer. The point I'm trying to make to you, the potential buyer, is that Resident Evil has changed. Not for better, not for worse. It's just different. If you're hoping for a survival horror experience, it won't be found here. If you're expecting an RE revival, forget about it. But if you're interested in a quality, A-list third-person game with some horror elements, a lot of gore, and a plethora of fight-for-your-life situations (which typically involve ACTION, regardless of the game) then go pick up a copy.\n\nWhat eventually drove me to write this is going back and reading reviews of RE1 and 2. The complaints for those games are:\n1. The camera\n2. The aiming\n3. The pacing (too slow)\n4. The controls (move like a tank)\n5. The "stupid" puzzles\n6. Not enough ammo\n7. Can't move and shoot\n\nNow the complaints for RE6:\n\n1. The camera\n2. The aiming\n3. The pacing (too fast)\n4. The controls (move like an action hero)\n5. The lack of puzzles\n6. Too much ammo\n7. Moving and shooting is lame\n8. Zombies body parts fall off and can't shoot them in the same area anymore (someone actually complained about this)","December 27, 2013","true","76.3"," 482 of 582 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","482","582","0","31"

It was not because the horror elements were gone – I was already used to this by Resident Evil 4/5, games I liked for what they were, even though I have the most fond memories of RE1 and RE2. Of the newer RE games, "Revelations" is my favorite and atm I'm a real happy camper regarding RE HD remake. But my hate for RE6 was not because it left survival horror fans in the lurch, it was due to other things:\n\n1) The game starts off with an irritatingly long and superfluous prelude, which one has to trudge through before the real game starts – and even then, there’s not happening much in the first 20 minutes of Leon’s campaign (which Capcom meant us to play first). There’s way too much handholding - you can’t run, you can’t shoot etc until the game *finally* lets you. That section is obviously meant as a tutorial, but it comes across as longwinded and boring (especially after that prelude). And to top it off, it even utterly fails to give you an overview over and insights into the most important functions like sliding, taking cover, quick-shoot, counter, dodging etc.\n\n2) Once Leon’s campaign picks up, for a time RE6 seems to be great fun after all – until all is smothered by lots and lots of atrocious quick time events, some of which are seemingly impossible to master. I made it through the first campaign - but I was enraged and determined to abandon the game, never to pick it up again.\n\nAnd then something happened: First I heard QTEs for RE6 were patched – you can now let the game do most of them for you. Second, I read that the QTE’s rage inducing difficulty was often simply due to lag. If resolution and graphics settings are too high for your system, not only do controls start to feel sluggish and clunky, but the timing for the QTE’s is totally off. Third, I read a FAQ detailing the “advanced controls” for movement and fighting, which the game itself does not bother to explain. In that FAQ, I also read that there are options where the FOV for the camera and aiming can be vastly improved. I eventually decided to give RE6 another go.\n\nAnd what shall I say – I suddenly fell in love with it. If the settings are chosen just right, the controls handle like a charm and the game finally gets a chance to shine in its combat modelling. I also came to appreciate that the campaigns play vastly different: Leon/Helena get zombies and puzzles, Chris/Pierce is like playing a tactical shooter, Sherry and Jake get hunted by a “Nemesis”-type enemy (and Jake as an unarmed combat expert plays very differently from say Leon). Then there’s finally Ada Wong: She is also good in unarmed fighting, has some puzzles, stealth sections and her campaign ties up the remaining loose ends of the interweaving story lines. The story itself is ambitious, but of course campy as usual. It’s main shortcoming is that the main adversary is not very impressive this time around. The boss fights, however, are all very good and the enemy variety overall is definitely the best in any RE-game as of yet. The sheer amount of content this game has to offer is huge! I eventually even began to like the sections where you have to drive a car, fly a plane etc. – these are all welcome diversions that add to the variety.\n\nMy conclusion is that RE6 is severely underrated. For the most part, this is Capcom’s and the game’s own fault, but still! I will recommend it to you like this: If you liked RE5, then by all means give RE6 a chance! Buy it on sale, and if you heed the things I wrote above, you should be able get a lot of fun out of it.","January 26, 2015","true","158.0"," 120 of 142 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","120","142","10","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/221040/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Once again a game I can neither recommend nor downrate which proves there should be a "neutral" button. It is difficult to evaluate this game considering the issues and also the good parts it has. I am in between and being offered the two extremes only is not sufficient.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n--- The game offers not one but four campaigns! This is pretty cool considering the 4 couples you have which means 8 characters - each with a different personality, extra attack or weapon and importance when it comes to the storyline. Also, enemies approaching you differ in each campaign. The same goes to the locales. While Leon and Helena traverse through the big city, a cemetery and a cathedral offing dozens of zombies Chris and Piers do the same but in China. They are attacked by J'avos - these are infected people with the ability to plan their attacks and can also use firearms.\n\n--- Graphics / cutscenes / sound effects -> production value. Well, after episode 5 it was obvious the creators would take this to another level.  The game looks stunning and the atmosphere is there. The coop and action sequences once again decrease the horror elements but nobody can say they did not try! Also, there are dozens of cutscenes and in the game's menu you can rewatch all. Altogether I'm sure it will take at least 2 hours to go these in one sitting.\n\n--- Longevity. Once again we have collectibles that come in the form of emblems. I have found many but could not find a lot either. There are no more treasures as collectibles. Instead, there is something else that is dropped by the enemies and they represents points. This amount can be used to purchase skills. These can then be levelled up. 3 skills can be active at a time and there are enemy-specific ones, too. So, you and your coop partner need to work together and decide who equips what. Multiplayer also returns in the form of Mercenaries and there is now a new game mode called Agent Hunt.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\n--- 4 campaigns: In terms of story and characters this is really good but there are too many intersections. In fact, there are boss battles you need to play twice. Really? Of all this it is Ada's (4th) campaign that is the worst. First of all, almost all the areas are familiar and you encounter hardly any new enemies. Throughout all the campaign you know what's going to happen and the ending is a total letdown. Not only this but Ada plays alone. Your friend assumes the role of a so-called Agent - a guy who's just there so that the creators can tell they did really make a coop game. Agent wears a mask and does not have a real name.  In the cutscenes you see Ada alone and throughout the campaign Agent cannot interact with anything. You cannot open doors or chests, you cannot solve any puzzles and no QTEs for you (which is actually good). You can pick up bullets, of course and fight with Ada but feel like an unnecessary character who does not even have a story.\n\n--- Cheesiness: If you thought episodes 5's dialogue was bad you are in for a great surprise. Some of the conversations the protagonists have are just dumb. In fact, you can easily guess what will happen next. The script should have been reworked at least 3 times to eliminate some of the worst dialogues this franchise has ever seen.\n\n--- Boss battles: They are waaaaaaaay toooooooooo loooooooooooooong! You battle the same guy while he assumes at least 3 different forms one after the other. The tactic is different as well as the environment. It is not necessarily a problem but the game is very difficult and also you are 100% sure you eliminated your foe when he returns once more to annoy you. I have to admit the enemies are great (each one of them poses a real threat) but you battle them for too long. This gets boring and aggravating considering the difficulty of the game.\n\n--- Difficulty level: This game is annoyingly difficult. From time to time you get a QTE which is next to impossible to complete for the first time. Missing it will result in a death cutscene - well, I appreciate the developers wanted to show me what cutscenes they had conjured up in their mind but this is still pretty annoying. Boss battles can be a pain and the controls do not help either. It is a sad thing to say since this game enables you to do pretty much everything: you can run, do fistfight, dodge and even slide. And finally: you can walk while aiming at an enemy! The problem is with the turning and the speed. Also, the camera does not help and sometimes you get attacked because our heroes are looking at what's going on elsewhere in the distance.\n\nFor me Resident Evil 6 was annoying. I could handle 5 but the latest instalment was just too much. Campaign and firefight was good but Ada's story was a silly way to end a game and the difficulty level did not pose a real challenge (it was annoying instead).\n\nIf you are a newcomer, do not start with this one. If you liked the predecessors you can pick it up but buckle up as the ride will be long, tiresome and irritating! Of course, for hardcore RE fans the 6th instalment is a must.","November 16, 2014","true","23.6"," 157 of 200 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","157","200","10","11"

It's a fantastic action 3rd person shooter that excells at what it's supposed to do. Fluid controls, satysfying gameplay with tons of variety, great replay value (especially with friends), beautiful and or atmosphereic level design, and TONS of content that will keep your playtime peaking in the hundreds.\n\nLet's look at this in more depth\n\nGameplay:\n\nI've been playing shooters my entire life and never have I encounterd such a game that matches the amazing controls 6 has to offer, tank controls in previous Resident Evil games are non existent, so expect to move like a butterfly and pull off some intresting tech. For instance, you can slide down through a enemy's gap between his legs, plant a bomb WHILE you're sliding in his legs, get up and watch him explode into bits. There's a ton of variety in the gameplay as you're pit up with a VAST amount of weapons, enemies and bosses to fight, melee combat is also different with each and every character you play as, without spoiling anything, expect to never get bored of what the game has to offer.\n\nThe content this game has to offer is something else, you have bonus modes such as Mercinaries or Mercinaries No Mercy. Both of those  will easily satisfy anybody who wanted something more out of the game, you're set up on a stage and character of your choice and you have to survive, while killing the most amount of enemies in a given time, each stage has it's own set of enemies and design to give, most will give you quite a challenge. There's also Agent Hunt and other DLC content which I haven't bought yet.\n\nReplay value in this game is huge, there's a new game plus mode everytime you beat the game, in that you get to keep the items you picked up during the campaign. There's a lot of difficulty and edits you can make to the gameplay to suit anyone's needs. If you want something where ammo is more scarce and you run the risk of dying very fast if you're not carefull, play on professional mode. I once had to KNIFE 2 enemies to death because I used up all my ammo, and I was being very carefull with them too! There's also little skills you can add to your character, such as infinite ammo, not being revived by an A.I partner, more damage with weapon x, etc.\n\nIn short, RE6 shines in a lot of areas, however the gameplay will sit just right with anyone\n\n\nStory:\n\nIt is what it is, without spoiling anything, expect to have a moment for everything, sad moments, happy moments, funny momemnts and everything in between. I've also found the dialogue to be amusing at times to, though it does vary.\n\n\nEveything else:\n\nSoundtrack fits every moment, and expect to find a few songs catchy. As I've said before, level design is very atmospheric and well done, it ranges from very creepy to beautifull neon lights, though this isn't the prettiest game of 2013, it sure as hell makes up for it with asthetics.\n\nLet me know if I forgot anything, feel free to ask me anything about the game.","October 31, 2015","true","102.9"," 138 of 181 people (76%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","76","138","181","14","2"

People expect it to play like a game they played years ago; Completely ignoring the fact that the industry and even players have changed.\n\nIf Resident Evil #1 released these days, It would be flamed. The controls were terrible by today's standards, There's no hand-holding whatsoever and the limited inventory just don't work when compared by today's standards.\n\n"But what about the HD Remaster?" - Well, As you well know Resident Evil is a massive franchise with fans of the old games that many developers dream of. The nostalgia alone sells copies. But don't get me wrong; It's a fantastic game - Like really, really good. But not one that would survive without the Resident Evil brand these days.\n\nGames have to update; Change up their mechanics to fit in a world where the games today aren't the games that players were playing years ago.\n\nThis is Capcom's attempt to introduce a new generation to the Resident Evil universe. Using characters from the old games (As well as some new additions), Capcom have updated the gameplay of the classic Resident Evil games (To be more in line with what gamers "Want") and sprinkled some innovation on top and it's a fantasic game that I highly recommened.\n\nThe reason I've mentioned all that stuff above is that a lot of negative reviews are from people who haven't realized that games HAVE to be updated mechanically as well as aesthically to stay relevant these days.\n\nIt's the exact same reason MK X doesn't play like MK 1, 2 and 3. You just can't pull something like that off anymore. The compeition is different, the customers are different and the tools that are around these days are fantastic stuff.\n\nIf you're still not convinced; Think of the freakin' Beatles. They couldn't go on making soppy pop-love songs their whole career; They had to update their image, Change their style. To fit in not only with the change of fans but with the music industry as a whole.\n\nThis is Capcom's "White Album" and I have to say it's a rather fantastic one. I noticed looking at the forums on Steam a lot of people have reported bugs; But I managed to complete the game reletively bug-free; In fact, I don't think I encountered a single bug in my 13 hours playthrough.\n\nI hope this review has helped some people and I really do hope you give the game a go; It's definately a fun experience!","May 23, 2015","true","13.2"," 191 of 279 people (68%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","68","191","279","12","27"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/221040/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","Last Update: June 2015.\n\nI'll try to keep this as short as possible.\nResident Evil 6 is not what an oldschool/hardcore gamer would call a "RE game". It's an attempt to make the game more over the top, action-y and cinematic as much as possible while having that cheesy dialogue and plenty of references to older titles. Hence it's an action game with barely any horror. If you're able to accept that then you'll also be able to enjoy it. The game has 4 co-op campaigns that have 5 chapters each (average chapter length is 1 hour), 2 characters you can play as in each campaign and 5 difficulty settings. Considering it's a co-op game you should probably play and laugh with your friends, but in worst case scenario you can also play with the AI. Unlike RE5's Sheva your AI partner is completely self-sustaining and you don't have to babysit. The mechanics here are the most advanced in the series and a lot of people enjoy Mercenaries mode because of it. Now that I've mentioned the campaigns - we can say that to complete the on 1 difficulty with both characters already will take quite a while, now let's multiply this by 5 difficulty settings and we hell of a lot gameplay time. The game has huge replay value (far bigger than RE2 or REmake) and with a right friend you'll be able to enjoy this for quite a while. If you want more then there are competitive DLC modes. If you're looking for people to play with then you should check http://steamcommunity.com/groups/re6mp\n\nAMD users should be aware that latest drivers result in the infamous black screen on startup. If you wait for a couple of minutes the game will load. The time depends on how juicy your system is.\n\nAgain, If you're going to play this game because it's a RE title then you'll have a bad time. If you're in for some laughs and co-op then this is easily the best co-op game of that year.\nAnd if you're looking for actual horror then you should get Resident Evil Remake Remaster and Resident Evil 0 Remaster.\n\nFinally, here's a list of alphabetical pros and cons.\nPros:\n-Agent Hunt. A special game mode in which YOU take control of the enemy. You can join any open lobby and try to take down players that are just playing the game. Requires patience, skill and preferably a partner.\n-Characters. RE6 offers both Chris and Leon as playable characters in separate campaigns. Not only that, there are total of 8 (campaign) and 13 (no mercy mercenaries) playable characters.\n-Collectibles. Just like RE4,5 RE6 has some collectibles that you can find (serpents than unlock documents and figurines).\n-Completionist friendly. There's a lot of things you can complete in the game and boy you'll have to spend more than a few hundreds of hours to do that.\n-Controls. The controls now are less tanky and more action-y, fluent. You can manually dodge, counter, slide, etc. After playing RE6 for a while and returning to RE5 you'll see what I mean. The only downside is that you have to learn and master the controls yourself (which is not an easy thing to do). Be sure to check Archon's "Basic and Advanced Mechanics" guide.\n-DLCs. They offer fun competitive multiplayer minigames and extra achievements for them. These game modes are as fun as Mercenaries. Survivors is a deathmatch mode (standard and team, up to 6 players, most popular). Onslaught is a mix between Dr. Mario and Mercenaries (kill enemies to send them to your opponent, 2 players only). Predator is the mode in which you take control of Ustanak and try to defeat other players (up to 6 players, 2nd most popular). Siege is a BOWs vs humans team match in which you have to try to save an NPC (up to 6 players, least popular).\n-Enemies. Quite a huge variety of them this time. Also they can mutate on the go. They act, look differently and have different attacks.\n-Events. residentevil.net offers different types of events so you can unlock some in-game on website goodies.\n-Melee. You can use knifes and your fists/legs to punch bould... enemies and execute them in most brutal ways. Source of the wrestling simulator game jokes.\n-Mercenaries. Many people (sometimes jokingly) say that it's the only reason why you should get this game. Well, they're not far from the truth either. This mode offers a fun solo/duo survival challenge on 10 different maps, provides you with all characters and special costumes for each. There's also a PC exclusive "No Mercy" mode which is a Left 4 Dead crossover (characters and enemies) and it's even more challenging.\n-Nemesis v2. The game has an enemy that is similar to Nemesis from RE3.\n-Options. The game allows some nice tweaks including camera placement, FOV and crosshair swaps. Be sure to check the options in the main menu (they're more advanced than in-game's).\n-Ranking system. You can earn ranks on each chapter for each character. Great thing from completionists. Ranking is based on your accuracy, kills, time and deaths.\n-Replay value. The main story offers a lot of content that can be replayed many times.\n-Skills. You can earn points and purchase skills that can alter the gameplay a bit.\n-Soundtrack. Many people either forget about it or it gets lost as background noise. The game has a great huge soundtrack that adds a lot to the game.\n-Statistics. Residentevil.net offers advanced game statistics.\n-Story. Many people would say that this is BS, but I think that RE6 offers better, brighter and more silly, over the top story than ever before.\n-Unlockable free content. You might say that it's similar to an on-disc DLC, but I don't think it's bad. On residentevil.net you can unlock special files and costumes for your minigames.\n-Variety of weapons. Knives, guns, machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbow, grenade launchers, magnums, remote bombs, grenades, etc.\n\nCons:\n-Bugs. The game still has some connectivity issues and sometimes it crashes. Some issues might appear if you have incredibly high ping.\n-Camera. Might be one of the reasons why you'll die a bunch of times.\n-Controls. Some people may find the controls a bit too difficult/messy. They require a lot of time to master and even an experienced player may not know all the tricks. On top of that, an experienced Agent Hunter can easily take down newbie agents.\n-DLCs. They're not free. You have to pay for them. It's hard to find active sessions, but people are playing them.\n-Enemies. While there are still "zombie" BOWs now there are also J'avos, that can use weapons, can communicate with each other (similar to plagas infected).\n-Graphics. Generally OK, but texture-wise this is a console port and there are plenty of dodgy textures.\n-Puzzles. Some of them are ar simple (stupid), just like in oldschool REs. But due to fast paced gameplay you don't stumble upon them as often as you'd like to.\n-QTEs. The game has quite a lot of them, but they aren't difficult and not as unforgiving as in RE4/5. QTEs can be turned off completely.\n-Single player. Playing alone isn't as fun as it's in co-op. You can't disable your AI partner either.\n-Story. You could say that it's too over the top and less realistic than before. Some may say that it's a B-movie, just like RE1.\n-Survival horror. Barely any left.\n\nFAQ.\nQ: I've launched the game and I'm greeted with a settings screen and then the game starts. Where's the main menu?\nA: Upon first launch you're greeted with a 15 minute prologue.

The camera is so zoomed in, it kind of hurt my eyes. But then later on, I found out that you can zoom out in the option settings. Thank God, it really helps a lot. And well, I decided to just play just to see how the story goes.\n\nIt is true, the game is actually pretty radically different from the previous Resident Evil games, as the game is no longer a survival horror like it used to be. But.... I think Resident Evil 6 is still in a way, a survival horror game still, kind of. There are basically tons of zombies that you can kill, but you do not really get much of ammo in the game. Meaning it is necessary to save ammunition and just keep running. The stages are huge, especially the Leon's story, and it is basically recommended to just run rather than dealing with those zombies one by one. I thought it was kind of interesting, because I guess this is a little more realistic than having to deal with every zombie that you encounter. The control has gotten better and I did not really find much of issues with it. As many have complained, QTE happens a lot in this game, but I am not sure. I don't think it was "that" bad, as you still get the chance to redo that part right away even if you die anyway. And many people also complained about the difficulty of the game being too hard even on normal. I am not sure if the game has gone through some radical changes with the updates (I know it did for camera), and this might be the reason why I do not really find this game that bad. The game is certainly playable and enjoyable from start to finish. For someone like me who likes Call of Duty style action a lot, Resident Evil 6 is certainly the game that I can recommend to any action game fans. Not every RE fan would find this game fun, but it was good enough for me. Good stories and beautiful endings for Leon, Chris and Jake, too. I didn't really bother with Ada's story, as it is kind of boring. Overall, great game. Looking forward to Resident Evil 7.\n\n9/10","November 28, 2013","true","57.0"," 90 of 130 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","90","130","0","6"

Where Resident Evil 1-3 were all about horror, 4 more about action/horror and 5 more action than horror, 6 has finally come to the point where there's no more horror at all, and it's all about the action. Granted, it's campaigns are long and to complete them all will take you well over 20 hours (1-1,5 hours per mission). But I couldn't even finish the journey.\n\nSo far I've finished Leon's campaign and am near the end of Chris', but it's mostly shooting, with an awkward co-op partner at your side. The animations of Leon were wooden and there will tons of QTEs, yet Chris' animations were fine and his campaign had practically no QTEs. It's like they were made by entirely different teams. The Japanese influences can be seen in all of the campaigns and maybe that's what makes the game so boring. Instead of moving forward it looks like they went backwards when compared with Western developers. I can't really explain, it's just a feeling, and the fact that it's absolutely not scary at all, when, well, it should be.\n\nI heard good things about the Mercenaries mode so I'll be sure to give that a try, and I might finish the campaign over the next couple of weeks/months, but for now it's just too damn boring.\n\nEdit: I finished this later and unfortunately it never improved. So my original review still stands.\n\n[Rating: 65/100]","April 13, 2013","false","23.3"," 138 of 211 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","138","211","0","9"

Kennedy (US Government agent), Helena Harper (agent for the United States Secret Service), Chris Redfield (former member of the BSSA), Piers Nivans (a member of the BSAA), Jake Muller (the illegitimate child of Albert Wesker), Sherry Birkin (a US Government agent) and Ada Wong (a freelance agent framed for the bio-terrorist attacks by Neo-Umbrella). All must work together and confront the force behind the latest bio-terrorist attack that has just unleashed a deadly new virus into the world - the C-Virus.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=139128015\nThe latest installment in the Resident Evil franchise received a lot of flak from the gaming press and user's alike upon it's console release and I can understand a lot of the criticism. It does overly rely on far too many QTE events, some of them borderline frustrating (take the final boss in Chris and Pierre's campaign which is hair-pullingly dreadful) and it still insists on being the director and star of its own production with the gamer often merely being the observer. It also has overly grand ambitions in its attempt to tie all four of its stories together into a cohesive whole, not all of them particularly successful. In trying to be the most cinematic Resident Evil of the lot, it often muddles its Spielberg with its Bay as the game relentlessly shifts from thrilling to bombastic and ludicrous.\n\nThe games inventory, particularly that of making health power ups, is frustrating - adding more steps to what was an already cumbersome affair in the other titles. The campaigns are also a bit of an uneven mess with Leon and Helena's campaign dragging on for what feels like forever and a day. Also this particular campaign is the closest in look and feel to a survival horror title except for the fact that there is so much ammunition lying around you could stock pile it and sell it to some third world dictator. The 2nd campaign, ripped straight from the pages of Gears of War, is so action focused that you will be surprised to find so little ammo lying around that you are constantly running out. It's these inconsistencies that will either make you love or hate the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=138469490\nBut my-oh-my is it a grand old adventure when played in co-op. Yes - each campaign comes with a host of irritations and for many these shortcomings may be a tad too much to bare. Having co-oped with a mate from the beginning to end this was one of the best co-op experiences of the year. Looking past the game's shortcomings it's clear as daylight this is a game that was never meant to be played alone. Weapons feel authentic and suitably forceful, there is many a scene where the game might not go for outright horror but it still manages to be successfully creepy and on the higher difficulties, if not on your guard, you can easily be swamped and taken over by the shuffling horde.\n\nI was a bit disappointed when I realized the game was not making use of any DirectX 11 features but those disappointments were soon laid to rest. The character models are gorgeous and some of the environments very nicely rendered.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=137519041\nI realize I am in a small minority here who actually really enjoyed the game. It felt like I was living a terrifying action/horror movie the entire time I played it and that is the highest praise I can give it. Grab a mate, set your expectations accordingly and give it a shot - it may just surprise you like it did me.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 1, 2014","true","60.8"," 100 of 154 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","100","154","0","5"

They aren't even trying any more. The character interactions are a joke at best. The bosses are CLICHE, and that's being generous. It really feels as though Capcom is slapping the american gamers in the face with some of the sh!t they pull.\n\nThe game play fails on every end.  You are clunky and not in full control over your character.  The amount of times the game is going to take control of your camera and force you to look at something useless is insulting.  Because it happens in the midle of a fire fight! It's not a survival horror game, because it's way to cheesy for that. It's not an action game, because you are most offten short on ammo when you're playing as Chris. The enimies have unlimited ammo, but don't always drop it when killed.\n\nIf you are going to play this, just play Jake's and Leon's sections. As leon, you are at least killing zombies. And Jake... You will laugh your ♥♥♥ off if nothing else. If you ask me, $20 is twice what its worth. This game is hardly worth one play through; re5 was better.

Hold your tomatoes and hate for a moment!\n\nLook I get it, Resident Evil was a fun horror series with a totally different gameplay style and was horror focused and I agree that's how it SHOULD be. However- capcom dun screwed up and this is the result.\n\nOn it's own the game is fun co-op, I'm sticking to that for this review as I've only ever played it co-op so just keep that in mind, however I'm going to try to limit comparing this to the other games because franky these may as well be called: Anti-Terrorism Heroes: EXTREME FORCES\n\nThe story is dumb, incredibly dumb over the top garbage with things that make no sense and are outright impossible. I'm all for silly goofy games like Earth Defense Force but this is TRYING to be serious. Though let it be noted no Resident Evil game ever really had a good story, it was more about the atmosphere and survival aspect. The lines are well acted for the most part but some things no matter how well acted if the writing is dumb, it's gonna be dumb. In short: do not buy this for the story.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and keeps things moving, you have several campaigns to play through with all different characters and even enemies to deal with. There's all different guns and mechanics to how characters attack (with Melees and what not).\nIt's a fun game to play through, the gameplay is solid and with a friend it's just a load of fun. The game really works well co-op, say what you will you actually have to work together at times and it makes it that much more enjoyable. Also, it's co-op online and split screen, that's REALLY uncommon with PC games so this is welcome\n\nThis is only enhanced by the Mercenaries mode which is far far, FAR better on PC- how? They have a mode for PC only that has something like 5x the enemies in the game, it's insane how hard it can be to play and it's great for it. Mercs mode is a sort of survival/time trial mode, it ends when: every enemy has been killed, time runs out (extendable by melee kills or time icons). Each character is playable and has their own different equipment, so there's a lot to be played here- again extended by the PC version having Left 4 Dead 2 characters in it  <=awesome.\n\nIs it a good game? Well gameplay wise yes it's very fun with a friend, the story is dumb as hell but it ...keeps things moving I guess?\n\nLook is it as good as the old R.E. games? They're just not comparable, they're different and yes it's a shame they pulled a left turn with the series like this, especially with RE1 having such an incredible remake. But I can't deny this game has been a lot of fun. I know the hate is huge but screw it there's new horror games coming out and we'll get to enjoy those, capcom just ...isn't doing what any of their fans want.\n\nSo, in short: Fun 2 player local/online co-op game, lots of time to put into it, variety of enemies, characters and weapons if this all sounds good? Give it a go, it's good.\n\n\n","May 23, 2014","true","68.4"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","41","61","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/221040/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Resident Evil 6 at its best is a varied and fun co-op experience that will keep you guessing what sort of scenario you'll find yourself in next, with some of the best controls in the series and some legitimate fun and tense segments. At its worst, it is a confused mess of ideas that tries to be everything, but doesn't quite refine or completely solidify any of its concepts. I almost reckon Resident Evil 6 to a grab-bag. It throws a lot at you; one moment you'll be in a ruined neighborhood in a zombie Apocalypse as chaos springs around you, next you'll be near-naked maneuvering a completely-white environment while stealthing to avoid setting off alarms, then flying a plane Ace Combat-style over the ocean, or scaling the side of a building as a colossal monster climbs right after you.\n\nIf you're the type of gamer who enjoys sometimes complete nonsense with a friend, but also the variety of situations appeals to you, this will be right up your alley. It is a fun co-op game, the combat isn't well explained and can be frustrating at first, but once you begin to 'get it', it actually is rather in-depth, and Mercenaries is a lot of fun (the most similar comparison I can give is to the game Vanquish, if you have played it, as the combat focuses a lot on dodging gracefully and sanctification from pulling off insane stunts by risk and reward). There's a lot of content here, with four campaigns (each completely different) that last 5-8 hours each, as well as an addicting Mercenaries Mode and a rather throw-away but still good for a few laughs mode where you control the monsters in other peoples games during certain gameplay segments.\n\nBut Resident Evil 6 is riddled with problems in its design, ranging from poor level-design, missing the sort of weapon upgrade system the last few 'action' RE titles incorporated to allow one to pick weapons by choice, the boss fights range from okay to dreadful (they're often more cinematic flairs than strategic or actually fun battles, which I felt RE4 and RE5 had), and simply some segments of the game just are not fun. And if you don't take the time to adjust to how the game plays (its pacing, controls, and the like on face value appear to be very much in-light with RE4 and RE5, but actually playing the game like those games isn't a lot of fun as the game is designed quite a bit differently) it is very possible you will not enjoy your time with it. It should also be mentioned that the story is terrible. Not cheesy B-fun like RE5 and RE4, not so-bad-its-good, but most of the story is just bad. I did enjoy some development in Chris's story, and the relationship between Jake and Sherry is cute, but outside of that, the basic 'plot' to the story almost feels like a fanfiction to the series.\n\nBut still, I had a lot of fun with it. Something about never knowing what to expect, going from one ridiculous scenario to the next with a friend, and coming to terms with the game and actually feeling pretty awesome fighting off a fairly large array of enemies in Mercenaries Mode was worth it for me, and for those who just want a good, often ridiculous time with a friend, Resident Evil 6 can deliver some good laughs and some high peaks in spades. Just expect to waddle a bit through some drudgery.\n\nPS. I find a lot of people like different moments of the game the best, for the campaign, I will say my personal highs were (in no order) Leon Chapter 1, Leon Chapter 2, Jake Chapter 3, Jake Chapter 5, Chris Chapter 3, Chris Chapter 4, Ada Chapter 1, Ada Chapter 2, and Ada Chapter 4.","November 26, 2013","true","154.0"," 59 of 93 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","59","93","0","0"

It is so bad, I am not sure where to even begin, so let's just start with the intro scenes. The introduction takes about an hour to get through, and that is primarily because it seizes from you your ability to control the speed you move. You're literally forced to walk for most of the introduction. As though the creators thought that wasn't slow enough, you're also forced to escort people who move even slower than you do.\n\nOnce you trudge through the horribly boring introduction, you can look forward to continuing to randomly have your ability to control your speed revoked. You can also look forward to inconsistent controls. Sometimes a melee attack will hit an enemy, sometimes not - I tested this after a checkpoint. To add to the unnecessary difficulty created by bad controls, you cannot attack the enemies that will stand up to attack you until after they do. This means that if you're supposed to walk across something that will try to grab your legs, you can't shoot it ahead of time, you literally HAVE to let it try to grab you before you can harm it.\n\nThis game is clunky, slow, frustrating, and has taken several steps backwards from previous games.

To give a bit of a frame for that statement, I think Remember Me is a decent game, the basic functionality you expect is all present and while not perfectly polished it doesn't deliberately get in the way. Well, in Resident Evil 6 it deliberately is in the way pretty much the entire game. Everything bare shooting is contextual. Which means that not only the levels are on rails, but that what you as a player can do is extremely on rails. Limiting freedom and as a direct result, pretty much negating any experimentation to be done, making the whole game a monotone press A feast (or what-ever the equivalent keyboard key is).\n\nAt least... that is what you'd think, right? Sadly, even with everything so heavily restricted it still doesn't quite work right. Executions not working, despite the prompt being visible was an all too common occurrence.\n\nAnother quip to be had with the technicalities is that it is literally a console port. Textures, details, effects and graphical options are all absent or of sub-par quality. While I can forgive some of that, textures in particularly should have being an easy addition for the computer version. If I wanted to stare at Doom like textures, I'd just launch Doom, at least that game works and lets me do what-ever I want, while looking terrible for today's standards.\n\nNow, as for story, as someone whom gave out on Resident Evil after part 2. (I've played some of 3 and 5, at a friends) Well, all of it didn't make sense. It is entirely uninteresting for anyone that isn't knee deep in the universe its lore. There's no other motivation than "Let's shoot some zombies" to bind anyone other than the Resident Evil Fan. Why? Because the character stories are laughable, spoiler for the Leon part ahoy!\n\nAs you start of the Leon part you'll begin by shooting the president. Apparently, that's very shocking, but not shocking enough to build up toward that occurrence, instead you may, right after escort random person A and random daughter of A whom will turn into zombies. It might be me, but it will probably be more... interesting to, you know, combine the two... escort someone the characters care about. But the game apparently has no time for that, because soon after you're stuck with another group of survivors, oh, my bad! They are all dead. Oh, but we've got to rescue your sister, no Leons sister, he doesn't have one, or does he? Here the game fooled me, actual story! Or well, so I hoped, just mystery now, but someone to save. I even have to rush down with her on my back while Leon fends of the zombies! This might go somewhere. Aaaaaand she turned into some kind of naked spider zombie. Yay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/221040/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","A combination of everything.\n\nResident evil 6 is the 6th entry to main 'resident evil' series. I began playing 6 after completing revelations, 4 and 5. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this game after looking at reviews and what not. However, after playing it for a while, I found that it has strengths and flaws.\n\nStoryHonestly it's a mess. The story is split into 4 campaigns. In each campaign you get to experience the story through the eyes of 1 or 2 characters. The problem is that their segments happen at different points in the timeline, so if you just play one campaign you will definitely be left confused. I was able to follow the story by completing one segment of a campaign, quiting and checking cutscenes menu to see which character's campaign level came next (ultimately playing all four at once). This did somewhat disrupt the gameplay, but definitely made the plot more understandable.\n\nGameplayForget horror, Resident evil 6 went full on action.  To explain clearly Resident evil 6 is like getting Resident evil 5 and giving it crack and polishing. The controls are the best in series yet. You can move freely while aiming and have the ability to freely dodge at a press of a button. Movement feel fluid and not clunky. Inventory management also makes a comeback, with items stored into horizontal segments.  You have a variety of weapons available including rifles, pistols, magnums, grenades, flash bang, flame grenades and knife. You can't upgrade weapons like previous entries. Instead, before starting the next campaign segment you can select and upgrade perks. Perks include increasing damage with weapons, getting more money, health, etc. There are no stores to buy weapons, health and ammo. You have to scavenge for them in the map or corpses instead. Unlike in previous entries where close combat was a dangerous affair, Resident evil 6 allows you to easily dispatch foes via melee attacks. You face a wide range of enemies including range, melee, wolves, zombies and bosses. there is plenty of cover available for you and your enemies to use. In a sense, this makes the game feel more like a third person shooter rather than a horror game. An issue I had with this game is the number of QTE (quick time events). There are so many of them during gameplay and cutscenes that kinda ruined the emertion with the game. There is an option that allows you to succeed all QTE during cutscenes, but not for gameplay unfortunately. Another issue I had was the camera suddenly changing POV, which takes control away from the player (forcing them to look in a particular direction) and made it cumbersome to navigate areas.\n\nThe gameplay types are somewhat split amongst the four campaigns.\n\nLeon/Helen Campaign = Action, zombies and puzzles\nChris/Pierce = Action\nJake/Sherry = Mix of everything\nAda = Stealth and puzzles\n\n\n\nGraphicsDefinitely an improvement over previous entries. Character models have good detail. The same can also be said of the environment as well.\n\nAudioAudio is acceptable. Voice acting is good with no annoying characters for a change (I'm looking at you Ramon Salazar, Ashley and Irving). Weapon sound effect are good as well.\n\nExtrasLike many resident evil games there is extra content to find and unlock. Each level in the campaign has a set of 'serpent medallions' for you to find and shoot (similar to BSSA Badges in resi 5). For each one you shoot, you collect documents which contain background information on the various characters in the campaign. If you complete a row of them, you unlock character trophies.\n\nAfter completing one of the campaigns, you will get the option of playing "New Game +" which transfers all your weapons and items in your next playthrough. There is also a section which allows you to view the cutscenes which you have seen during the campaign.\n\nMercenaries mode also makes a return. If you are unfamiliar, mercenaries mode places you (with or without another player) as one of several selectable characters in a map trying to hold out until the timer runs out. Each map has unique enemies, which come at you. There are items such a healing, ammo etc scattered around the map for you to collect. Time bonuses are available to extend the time to rack up a higher score. At the end of the round you get a score. Depending on how high the score is, you may unlock a new character to play with. New stages are unlocked by completing previous ones or playing the campaign.\n\nNo mercy mode is similar to standard mercenaries. The difference is that there are more enemies present at once so you can rack up higher scores. Also you can play as Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D) characters and Face some L4D 2 monster as well.\n\nFinal VerdictIf you are looking for a classic resident evil game with horror, stay the hell away. If you are looking for a good action game to be played with friends, this game will satisfy you.","May 12, 2015","true","26.6"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","32","47","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/221040/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account","Now with 50% more explosions\n\nThe newest game in the Resident Evil series, this game covers a number of characters from earlier titles, including Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy and Ada Wong, as well as newly introduced characters like Jake Muller, as they deal with the newest virus outbreak.\n\nStory\nA new terrorist organization calling itself Neo-Umbrella has managed to release their newest virus, and you will get to play through four different campaigns to find out exactly what is happening. There are a few surprises through the story, and I recommend leaving Ada for last as her campaign will spoil quite a bit otherwise.\n\nPresentation\nGraphically, the game is beautiful. Capcom didn't skimp on the visuals, with enemy models showing damage as you take them down, and the human characters looking pretty great as well. Locations are nice, and blurry textures were pretty rare during my time with the game.\n\nOn to the sound, and most of it is good here. For the music, it rarely did much to get me scared, but it never got irritating. The sound effects are a lot better, and the voice acting is well down, with the growls and moans from the zombies being just what I want to hear in a horror game.\n\nControls\nBreak out that 360 gamepad. Dealing with quick time events on the keyboard was a pain, and this game has a fair number of them. Its a lot easier to pull that stuff off with the gamepad.  Once you are using one, controls shouldn't be a problem, the mapping for it is just fine.\n\nGameplay\nAnd now for the most important part of any review, how the game plays. Sadly, this section is where it starts to get disappointing. Resident Evil 4 and 5 were shifting the series away from survival horror to an action game, and it seems as if this is finally done. Helicopters attempting to gun you down in the streets, running for your life as everything explodes behind you, gun fights everywhere you look, the series has changed a lot since the release of the original Resident Evil.\n\nWhile there are still a lot of zombies, mostly in the Leon campaign, most of your fights will instead be with the J'avo, mutated humans who still have access to all sorts of guns and other weapons. Would will be spending a fair chunk of battles taking cover from your enemies and popping out to let off your own bursts of fire. Damage their body and they may mutate further to deal with it, such as growing new limbs to replace the damaged ones or becoming beast like creatures which require more work to bring down.\n\nLifespan\nHere the game isn't too bad. As well as a campaign that can last about 20 hours, there are a few extra modes like the classic Mercenaries mode, the multiplayer Agent Hunt mode, and a few others which can be purchased as DLC.\n\nMercenaries has you against a large number of zombies and dealing with a timer. Rush to take them down, with each kill granting you more time, but trying to stay alive won't be easy. There is also the No Mercy mode for Mercenaries, which allows co-op and includes content from the Left 4 Dead series from Valve.\n\nAgent Hunt is an interesting idea. In this mode, you will take control of a random enemy and connect to a game of another user. You will then get the chance to attempt to kill the user yourself. Should he manage to take you down, you will simply become yet another creature in that map.\n\nAs well as the bonus modes, there are a number of collectables to find and destroy during the campaign, which unlock profiles and character models.\n\nGlitches\nOne rather annoying problem I had with this game was a glitch that causes the game to take a fair bit of time to start up. This doesn't effect everyone fortunately. I only need to wait on a blank screen for three minutes, but while looking on forums for help, I found others who were waiting up to fifteen minutes.\n\nClosing\nDespite the shift in focus for the series, this isn't a horrible game. It can be incredibly fun if you just want to mow down hundreds of enemies. Sadly, it isn't anything impressive, and with the glitch I mentioned above, it only gets a 6.","November 22, 2013","true","21.3"," 87 of 146 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","87","146","0","5"

I remember popping open my PlayStation to play the Director's Cut of the original and being truly terrified. There was really no game like Resident Evil. Even as it went on, it just seemed to get better, especially with it's master bomb in 2004 with Resident Evil 4. But, as always, with great success comes imitators. Along came games inspired by the RE series, like Left 4 Dead, Dead Rising, etc. When this happened, this is when the RE series went downhill.\n\nResident Evil 6 is the most different form in this franchise to date. For that it has received a ton of flak and haters have been tearing it to shreds.The big changes come in the form of being able to move and shoot at the same time and the stories intersecting at certain points allowing for 4 player co-op at some points throughout the game\n\nThe story itself is good if you follow the Resident Evil series. I thoroughly enjoyed the game's campaign in every way playing with friends in co-op, although the game is much less survival horror and much more horror shooter now. I'd like for it to go back to its roots but I'll take it as it is.\n\nFor those who wondering why RE 6 Became disappointed for you i will tell you why.\n\nBecause of how much Capcom loves their Baby they decided to bring every cooking chefs to cook this game very well to become Tasty. but what happened is, when you bring too much chefs the Food will be too much cooked and will burn.\nmeaning is. they cooked it too much.\n\nOverall: from RE old school player i enjoyed every RE game and i always take them as they are no matter how much they changed them. RE 6 is a Great dramatic action Packed & half horror game.\nAs long as you like the story of the Resident Evil genre then this game is for you. If you can't look past the changes then you can always play the classic Resident Evil games.","March 28, 2013","true","620.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

But this game is about as far from a Resident Evil game as you can get. I'm even at the point where I don't even want to acknowledge existence, same as RE4 & 5. As a firm fan of the original Resident Evil games: Resident Evil, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, the REmake on the Gamecube and Resident Evil: Zero, Code Veronica, etc. I actually felt offended by playing this pile of putrid rotting garbage.\n\nThe only reason I bought the game in the sales was because, A: I knew it was going to be a total car wreck of a game, and like a car wreck, you can't help but slow down and look. That and I couldn't find a copy to borrow. And B: The RE girls butts. If there is one thing Capcom got right with RE6 and Revelations (which was also terrible), were the females butts. Sweet lordy, the booty, hot damn. I have to pause and mop my brow occasionally when playing as Sherry or Ada.\n\nControls and camera are stupid too. In the sequences when you have to run away from a scripted event such at a helicopter blowing up platforms behind you, or something big chasing you, the camera spins itself around to look at the threat, which in turn makes your character turn around and run towards what you're trying to get away from. So you spend a lot of time jumping up something, then back down it, then back up it, then back down it, then you die. Stupid.\n\nGameplay? No exploration allowed. Follow a coridoor, shoot a bunch of "zombies", pass a QTE, watch a cut-scene. Wash rinse repeat for the whole game. Chris's campaign made me want to gouge my own eyes out. Not only is it a frat-boy demographic targeted, coridoor shoot-fest featuring zombies and chest high walls for that abortion of a CUVER SISTEM (the whole game is, really). Long review short, the whole game is basically Call of Evil: Resident of Duty, because Capcom desperately want to make the same amount of money that Call of Duty does. But with their already exsisting IPs, that's never going to happen, and all Capcom are doing are alienating their fans.\n\nAlso, the bosses NEVER ♥♥♥♥ing die. They just keep coming back and it's so boring and predictable. I think at one point Ada says "Why is it that nothing stays dead any more?" and I totally agree. Nothing dies, and just keeps on coming back and being boring to the point that is makes me want to cry.\n\nForced scripted vehicle/gunning segments everywhere, that loses the game a lot of points.\n\nAvoid this game like the plague. Do not give Capcom your money for this piece of ♥♥♥♥.","January 12, 2014","false","26.4"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","0"

This game is NOT the RE 1,2,3 "Horror Survival Experience", things change and evolve and after RE3. RE 4,5,6 are more of an "Action/Horror Experience", to me in my opinion it is almost like trying to start comparing both Star Wars Trilogy's, they are both Star Wars but they are both very different and I enjoy all six of those movies as much as I enjoy all of the six core Resident Evil games and that is including RE6 which does get allot of hate. But anyway, I will say that Leon's campaign has the most RE feel to it and while it can be a good argument that RE6 has a few too many "QTE" Quick Time Events RE6 is fast , fun, good story, great graphics, Co-Op and the added PC mode of "Mercenaries No Mercy" is just a blast to play Solo or with friends and with the characters from "Left For Dead 2" added it just puts it over the top awesome....","January 25, 2015","true","82.8"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","40","64","7","2"

The negative review comes from the fact that the game has a lot of flaws in my opinion.  I would really like to point out the things I like about the game first.  RE6 has great co-op features including the ability to play as monsters.  There are multiple characters that you play through and there are multiple story lines because of that.  This gives the game a lot of replayability and variety.  The story paths are split up into pairs of characters played alone or co-op, except for one story that is single player, and the story lines cross over each other allowing up to four player co-op at times.  Right now I bet you're saying, "WTF!!!! This game sounds awesome, why the negative recommendation?".  Well, that's because the save points are terrible making huge parts the story being replayed if you quit.  Another bad point is the fact that there is no way to kick a partner which can leave you stuck between quitting and replaying huge amounts of the story or being trapped with complete jerks at times.  Now I think this game will appeal to a lot of people too.  It is basically a third person corridor shooter so fans of that genre will most likely enjoy this game.  I just find the constant switch flipping and running back and forth in corridors a bit tedious.  RE6 is one of those games that is really on the border of being enjoyable for me but the drawbacks just slightly outweighed the assets.","January 3, 2014","false","5.7"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","26","39","0","0"

The game is spread across four campaigns, its legs trembling to stay on a cohesive ground. It doesn't know whether it wants to appeal to the Gears of War crowd, the Metal Gear Solid 4 lovers, or those who loved the survival action of Resident Evil 4. The sorry folks looking for a return to the tank controls and stark survival challenge of pre-4 RE games have long been angrily foaming at the mouth due to the series' action-game evolution. With 6, those mouths will continue to foam an ocean. Each campaign allows for a non-frightening co-op experience of shooting, moving, shooting, and kicking. Bring a friend along and laugh at cutscenes involving zombified Presidents and action movie cliches that have been outdated since 1998. Cackle when your partner keeps dying because of a poorly telegraphed scripted event involving a careening van. Through the laughs and the spastic camera, you may learn to warm up to this thing. The melee combat and head splattering can often be a crunchy delight. Chris Redfield's biceps have somehow shrunk since the last game as well and it feels like progress. I would compare this game to a "B-movie" if I didn't know about the IV money drip that Capcom pricked into this specimen. RE6 is like knowing that Armageddon's IMDB rating has been slowly rising over the past decade and resigning to the idea that everything will be OK. RE6 is an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet in small-town Oklahoma with the 1990's Capcom startup jingle playing on loop through a jukebox. Pay no more than 7.50 and slurp it down.

They took the suspense and replaced it with cheap jump scares mindless explosions and annoying quick time events, way too many. You always run out of ammo when things get hairy. Since this game has turned into an action game at least the game should have a decent amount of ammo around. You face the same bosses over and over again.  The ai is what you'd expect from a game with monsters they just run at you face first and they are bullet sponges. They try to make the game longer by having 4 different campaigns which see's every characters point of view leading to the conclusion. The only problem with that is you will run into the same environments over and over again and that makes the game tedious. This is the most ambitious resident evil to date cause it's the biggest one. Also what doesn't work is that they try to add in lot's of turret sequences and those suck. I will admit the scene where chris flies the jet and he has to shoot down the virus filled rockets was pretty fun. The 4 campaigns took me over 20 hours to beat. theres multiplayer but i never tried it. I doubt anyone is playing multiplayer. Overall I think capcom should have made the game 10 hours long and go back to the roots of what resident evil is all about. The only thing about this game that was good are the graphics and sound design everything else was disappointing. I had no problems running the game although the game did crash on me once. If you like resident evil go back and play the older ones cause their more fun. Overall i felt disappointed by this game by being another action game and capcom trying to cash in on the call of duty effect.","January 22","false","26.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

The game also fell to major technical problems such as framrates dropping to single digits 3-6fps, for no reason, and this was after several patches to 'fix' prior issues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xVArchonVx/recommended/221040/","xVArchonVx","Archon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xVArchonVx/","127 products in account","Each one of the 4 campaigns focuses on a different aspect that the RE games have covered. Starting with Leon's campaign we have a more old-school and slower-paced experience that aims to recapture the urban pandemonium of Raccoon City, except on a much larger scale as it takes us into China. Zombies and their assorted variants are the only enemies you'll face here (with the exception of the Rasklapanje, which shows up in all the other campaigns, and Ustanak) and you can tell that Capcom made a conscious decision to make sure that any other types of enemies did not appear within this campaign. The overall theme of horror is maintained all the way up until the middle of the 4th chapter when all hell breaks loose. Ending in true Resident Evil style via the use of a rocket launcher on the antagonist of that campaign.\n\nNext up is Chris' campaign. As you'd have guessed after playing Resident Evil 5, his campaign focuses on mostly action with one segment that is a tribute to Yawn from the original Resident Evil. Enemies in this campaign are strictly the gun-toting J'avo and their subsequent mutations. The J'avo are not to be confused with zombies, and as such do not fit any criteria of that word's definition. J'avo are the main reason for the more action-oriented segments within that campaign. Chris' story ends in one of the more dramatic scenes in Resident Evil history that truly sets the overall theme of redemption and sacrifice which his campaign covers.\n\nJake's campaign sees the illegitimate son of Albert Wesker being pursued by Neo Umbrella. I'd say that if there were one word to best describe the aspect that his story covers it would be "Retreat". Appropriately so, as the C-Virus B.O.W "Ustanak" hunts Jake down every step of the way in a clear nod to the Nemesis Tyrant from the game of the same name. Again, J'avo are the only enemies you'll encounter within this scenario.\n\nLastly we have Ada's campaign which is the most varied of all the stories, though it focuses more on stealth, survival and puzzles. In it you'll fight both zombies and J'avo as you try to unravel the mystery of Ada's doppleganger.\n\nSo now that we've covered the overall themes of the campaigns, let's get into what really sets this game apart from other Shooters. This game easily has the most fluid controls of any TPS I've ever played. Though at first glance, the game's controls seem pretty straight-forward for a TPS. L-trigger aims your weapon, right trigger shoots when your weapon is readied and melees when it isn't, while L3 makes you sprint. There is a cover system as well, but it's rudimentary and not nearly as elaborate as something like GoW or AoT. (Think of its inclusion in the same way that multiplayer functions in Dark Souls. It's implemented on a basic level and usually won't be used, but still useful when you find yourself in a bad situation.). Here, the game passes itself off as a generic shooter until you actually discover the dodging and melee mechanics. There is a good deal for me to cover, but let's start with the basics and a video of how well the combat system works when mastered https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUjmW5GgU_c\n\nHitting A or L3 (360 Controller) while your weapon is readied will cause you to dodge in place. Combining this with different directions on the left stick will allow you to dodge in the corresponding direction. Releasing the left trigger allows you to resume normal movement, but holding on it will cause you to lie prone with your weapon drawn. While prone, you can move in the same directions that you can while standing. Flicking the left stick will cause you to either roll to the left or right, or make you scramble backwards. This is an invaluable skill to learn for dodging/animation cancelling and setting yourself up for retaliatory attacks.\n\nSprinting while hitting the L-Trigger will cause you to slide on your back. This can be useful for getting through a bunch of enemies relatively safely, or to stun them for a melee attack. As with dodging, if you keep the L-Trigger held after sliding you'll go into a prone state. Quickly reversing your direction while keeping your weapon drawn will also allow you to flip yourself in the opposite direction while going prone. Next up is Quick-Shotting. Quick-Shotting is (as far as I know) a mechanic unique to Resident Evil 6 that allows you to fire a non-precision shot at your target. It is a crucial mechanic to master for quickly dispatching enemies with melee or for stunning them so that you can get into a better position. A Quick-Shot is performed by hitting L and R at the same time while using either the left or right analog stick to aim the direction of your shot. Keep in mind that the tracking radius for Quick-Shotting is rather small and it will target the nearest enemy in the direction you aimed. A Quick-Shot is always a guaranteed stun on most standard non-mutated enemies. Finally we have counters. Countering in this game is a mechanic that allows a player to evade an enemy attack and respond with one of their own. A counter can be performed on most non-boss enemies by hitting the R trigger (without your weapon drawn) at the appropriate time. Not only does this grant invulnerability frames, it also allows you to dish out a massive amount of damage within a short time (and is particularly useful for extending the Time Limit in Mercenaries mode.). Some enemies have counters unique to them (such as Bloodshots) that allow you to severely damage, if not outright kill them.\n\nSo yeah, sounds complicated? And you're probably wondering how well all of what I've mentioned in the previous paragraphs functions together. Well, sometimes Quick-Shotting can hit the wrong target if you fire it into a group (Though this rarely happens if you're keeping track of where enemies are around you.). The contextual action to parkour while sprinting is also a bit too sensitive, but can be easily managed by learning what you can and cannot parkour over, and when you should sprint. As for the cover system. You'd think that going into cover when your weapon is drawn and you're close enough to something would be a horrible game mechanic, but the game is very, very strict about how close and which way you have to be positioned for this to even happen. The cover system does its job well enough despite lacking a bit of polish, as this isn't a cover shooter. Control of the camera in this game will also be sometimes taken from you to focus on a point of interest or objective during the campaigns (you are usually invulnerable while this occurs, though enemies still move around), but generally not in a way that feels disorienting as long as you're actually paying attention to the game. Though, since you're not invulnerable once the camera control is returned, it can somtimes lead to enemies getting a cheap hit in on you. It's a minor issue, but is something that happens from time to time. There are a fair amount of QTEs in the game, similar in number to RE4's, but if you were able to handle the QTEs that RE4 threw at you, then RE6's should pose even less of a problem to you. There are also about 5 brief driving segments in this game (they're not really anything special, but they're handled well enough for what they are). Most bad reviews of the game like to hyperbole the camera and QTES in the game to absurd degrees. Again, as long as you're paying attention, you should not be failing the QTEs in this game (and there is an option that was patched in to allow the game to perform them for you, for the most part). One last thing to note is that the progression of chapters is pretty much straight-forward and linear (though there hasn't been an RE game since Dead Aim that wasn't as such).\n\nOverall, the game has a lot to offer for those actually willing to learn and master its controls, despite some poor design choices.\n\n8.75 out of 10\n\nVideo review can be found here: http://youtu.be/PjysLBQAY6o","April 28, 2013","true","504.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

However, they went with a qauntity over quality approach because of having three different story lines go off into one game. It was interesting and I kinda would like them to try it again one day. But with jamming so much into something so little really caused the game to feel not as constructed as a solid game.\n\nThere are many annoying aspects to this game and most of them have to do with the mechanics. Once you try out escaping the helicopter at the docks via Chris playthrough, you'll know the pain. Spoiler, run mechanics are broken as heck. Another thing to add is that you can trip over dead bodies which is painfully annoying.\n\nThe three style stories have a unique style of game play;\nLeon: More survival horror based, slow tankish enemies, generally took this part slowly\nChris: Full of action, guns, bullets flying everywhere\nJack: Running simulator\n\nOverall, great coop fun to shoot em' up and not over think the game as being some successor to resident evil.\n\n\n\n","May 12","true","32.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

And I liked most of new Resident Evil games. Most, but not this one.\nWhile I completed totally unfriendly RE 4 PC without mouse support mods and enjoyed the hell out of RE5 by playing both single and local co-op with my brother, this game just fatigued me after a few hours.\nIts main problems is terrible controls allocation and a ton of useless commands spread throughout most of the keyboard. Don’t fool yourself – you’re not going to use even 30% of them, and if you try you get dead while you look for the correct kay. I honestly cannot imagine if the controls are easier with the gamepad, since some of commands required two keys, plus a correct direction key.\nAnother issue is  that it’s bloated to four separate campaigns whose structure is at least inconsistent. So is storytelling. I was disappointed when after completing the first (Leon) campaign I got through most of weird Chris Redfield campaign, and discovered, that some sequenced I did from the same perspective, instead of opposite. The pinnacle of WTF was when at the end of first campaign i reached the part already shown in prologue, and it was completely retold in different way. That’s not how you are supposed to tell viewpoint related stories.\nWhat’s good about it? Probably graphics are okay, but they don’t impress me much after RE5, or rather introduction of X360 generation graphics. Really nothing else was better than in 5. The graphical low point for me was the new image of Ada Wong, who now looks as a china doll with much too wide cheeks, and too small mouth. Maybe it was an attempt to make the game more realistic, but I preferred the more manga-like version from RE4, and CGI movies.\nThe worst part is that I was genuinely interested in the story, and gave up on it near the end of second campaign. My recommendation? RE Revelations is a much better game even though it was converted from Nintendo DS. So either try this one, or wait for the upcoming sequel.\n","November 25, 2014","false","12.6"," 125 of 232 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","125","232","11","8"

Left 4 Dead is one of these games. Resident Evil 5 is one of these games. Dead Space 3 is one of these games. Even Daikatana, despite what many believe, is one of these games. You'll notice that there's a trend in these games, in that each one is worse than the last.\n\nYou'll also notice that Resident Evil 6 is not on the list at all.\n\nResident Evil 6 is a game that includes 4 campaigns, starring Leon, Chris, newcomer Jake, and the formerly secret Ada campaign. These campaigns total to around 30 hours in gameplay, with each of the first 3 campaigns being nearly as long as Resident Evil 5. You may think "Wow, what a bargain!", but you're missing one key component: almost none of it is worth playing. The game takes a severe quantity over quality stance, and even when the campaigns aren't directly overlapping (which is a feature, in which you might've been able to play with other people playing different campaigns in 4-player co-op at certain points if anybody was still around to actually play this game) you'll probably feel like you're just playing the same campaign over and over. Resident Evil 6 isn't a survival horror game, but it's not an action shooter either; it's just a third person shooter with really awful, gimped controls that are only worse when brought over to the PC. The only parts of the game that are even slightly redeemable are Leon's first chapter, which is about an hour long (some people will tell you that all of Leon's campaign is good, but those people are liars - all of Leon's personality and charm has been drained and given to Jake, instead) Jake's campaign, which is the only portion of the game that I would consider actually slightly worth playing at all, and the Mercenaries mode, which is as fun as ever. The story is a convoluted mess that puts literally anything in a series full of convoluted twists to shame, to the point that it makes Wesker suddenly returning with superpowers seem like a natural character development that was planned from the start.\n\nResident Evil 6 is, as a whole, just an absolute mess. A disaster. A waste of time, effort, and money. It feels like Capcom just got together 1,000 people and said "hey, make a video game" and let them each try to decide what horror is, and while Jake's campaign has an extremely noticeable increase in interesting locations and mechanics, the game as a whole just feels like a mess of ideas that don't go together at all and overall leaves the game feeling bland and mass-produced, and it's just not worth it. Even if you do play with a friend it's barely worth it, since it's not even good enough to play for the sake of laughing at since after more than an hour or two of 3 of the 4 campaigns your soul will have been stripped of the concept of laughter. Ada's campaign is bafflingly not even built for co-op in a game that spends 25 hours reminding you that co-op exists, and if you do happen to drag some poor soul into the game with you they get stuck playing as "Agent", a character with no dialogue, no background, no cutscene presence, and no physical prescence - he can shoot enemies, and that's about the extent, since he can't open doors, solve puzzles, pull levers, or generally do anything except get carted through the levels by teleportation whenever Ada uses her grappling hook.\n\nI can't even begin to recommend this game to anyone. There are some games that I hate that I can understand other people liking, but I have yet to see any sort of defense of Resident Evil 6 that didn't absolutely baffle me. For $30, you could buy Resident Evil 6, but $30 also buys you a ton of bleach that you could drink and have a way better time.","March 11","false","58.3"," 57 of 103 people (55%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","55","57","103","20","2"

The graphics are damn amazing and storyline just throws you into the situation of the main protagonist (whichever character you are playing). 7 players (3 females and 4 males) are very good each of them has their own skill and style to fight. Even if you have finished the game with all the players you can play multiplayer with your friends. Even if you have bad connection just switch the receivers voice and microphone off. The game also has many DLC to play like siege mode, Mercenary (this comes along the), Mercenary - No Mercy ( this too comes along ), Predator mode, etc. Predator mode allows you to play as ''Ustanak" which is 8th playable character, it has its own storyline which is AWESOME too!\nAlso, you can play as Zombie. Be a zombie and eat all the players who are acting to be a mercenary x) and show them who is the real mercenary xD. Controlling zombie is also easy and lets you be a pro at controls :D.\n\nThank you for reading,\nand my rating for this game is 100/100","November 19, 2015","true","17.0"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","23","39","3","0"

I know RE5 may not have been the best game in the series, but it was memorable because we got to play it together.\n\nThe story is really predictable and terrible. You'll notice the trend right off the bat once you start meeting people in the game. It's also really easy. At least there's less quick time failing to deal with. (I am HORRIBLE at quicktime because all I really want to do is shoot things in the face.) Oh, and skill really doesn't matter much.. Just keep shooting things and you're good. There's no real point to the zombies in the game anymore because really, it's like any other monster-fighting game now. Absolutely no fear at all.\n\nSo.. if you choose to buy it, go in with a sense of humour and giggle over the fabulous scarves that certain characters display proudly.

Capcom despirately wanted to lose money on this game, so they can finally write off the franchise. So they got there top designers team ready, and man, they did succeed.\n\nThe whole game has that great lackluster-epic feeling, that is so hard to get exactly right: They really did some nice innovations: During most boss fights you can just go smash some random boxes and search for some extra 9-mm bullets. When you smashed all boxes in the area you can check if the boss fight is still going on. Sometimes you are lucky and a cutscene start where the boss fight is moved to a new area. Otherwise it is best to start to shoot some bullets.\n\nThe art design is also very special. Nobody else can make a grey house, an grey outdoor level in a grey American village, grey corridors, a grey catherdral, grey walls, a grey dungeon, grey rooms ,and a grey US city all look so much allike. It all has that same special RE6 feel. It is very consistant, and it is probably a shoutout to Wistler's mom.\n\nFrom Star Trek they have borrowed the red-shirt principle. If in a cutscene a person wearing a helmet is talking to you you know he will die soon. So please never wear a helmet.\n\nThey also included many game mechanics that people really like to write about on the internets. So it got the briljant keymashing, instant-kill QTE. The game is very dark (illuminance not atmosphere) so you can save on your electric bill. It also has an erretic difficulty curve, so you are always on your toes.\n\nAnd as a spoiler, here are my final 15 minutes I had with the game: ....In the end I got to the invisible wurm boss, had a really long, drawn-out and boring fight and then there was a chase sequence where you are attacked by a helicopter and you have to jump from boat to boat, sounds like fun but wasn't.  The controls are just as bad or even slightly worse than for RE5. So I just uninstalled the game instead. I think that is the only way to win at this game.\n\nIn conclusion, maybe if the women wore skimpier clothes I could have enjoyed the game a bit more.","December 28, 2013","false","16.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Ok I love the RE series have since I was a young kid. This game trys to be to many things and doesn't stick to its roots.\n\nFirst off you got Leon's campaign.  This was actually a decent expereince for the first few parts and also cause there using zombies you know that enemy that made RE.  Yet it fails horribly with a boss fight that takes to long for its own good.  Other then that though if they would have just fleshed this one out and said screw it to the other campaigns I think we would have had a good time here. Leon's partner actually isn't annoying and has valid ♥♥♥♥ to say.\n\nChris's campaign is probably the worse one of the bunch which is a shame.  It goes all out for the action but there are way to many repetitive cutscenes that force you to watch as enemies come out of the wood works, couldn't I have just watched this happen in real time so I can shoot back and not be surrounded because the game forces you to watch as they come out.  I walk into a room a cut scene happens in real time im getting killed but I have to watch the cutscene cause it was so F-in important.   If you do get this game skip that campaign.\n\nJake's campaign is what I like to call boy meets girl.  This campaign is mostly about how Jake the big badass mercenary finally hits puberty and falls for girl. It suffers the same ♥♥♥♥ with Chris's campaign to many cutscenes that take away from the experience.  I will say I did enjoy the boss fight when you go one on one with a big badass other then that you go through the same ♥♥♥♥ you went through in Chris's campaign because there campaigns are intertwined which makes replayability low.\n\nAda's campaign is so-so.  At least it shows you alot of what was going on in the side but other then that it was pretty bland like this whole game was.\n\nBottom ♥♥♥♥ing line if you love the RE series this will be a kick in your balls or vag because it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The story was too convoluted and really it just makes for another stupid sequel unless Capcom pulls their head out of their ♥♥♥.  Capcom really ♥♥♥♥ed it on this one guys.","October 23, 2013","false","31.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Graphics are still the same or even a little bit worse than in the prequel. As far as I know RE 5 was a console port, too. But the difference was, that you didn't noticed. In RE 6 for instance there's a  button for dashing  and the  same button is used for action  such as climbing ledges. So imagine you're running from a B.O.W. and you walk pass a ledge. You automatically climb that ledge because you hold the  Dash / Action  button. This brings me to the parts, where you have to run from a giant B.O.W. or a helicopter (  Yes, a helicopter, but I'll come back to this later.  ). You dash in a particular direction and you see a ledge. You climb it automatically, and you think here it comes in handy, right? Wrong! You should release the action button and walk two steps away from the ledge, because the protagonist is going to climb automaticall down again. And up again, and down again and repeat. This caused 7+ deaths on the same spot.\n\nLet's get to the gameplay itself. You start for the first time with a prelude which you're going to recognize later in the game. In this prelude you will be introduced to every possible situation that you will encounter in the game, such as dashing, quicktime-event like situation where you have to mash your button sometimes or react at the right time.  The quicktime-event parts are the only thing that are better than in Resident Evil 5!\n\nThe Story\n\nThere are four campaigns:\nLeon\nChris\nJake\nAda\nForeword There is a new skill system added which allows you to carry eight boxes filled with three skills. You can switch between these boxes in  the menu which  woun't pause the game when you enter it or the item / weapon menu! You can unlock unlimited ammo for weapon types such as shotguns and equip these skills. There are eight weapon types, so you can't have unlimited ammo with all weapon types at the same time.\n\nThe hardest setting ( No Hope ) doesn't allow you to have any skill equiped!\n\nUnlike Resident Evil 5, you will get weapons which you can't collect. That means if you start over, you will have to wait, untill you get that weapon, for instance a magnum pistol. You can't upgrade weapons, only enhance their behaviour by equipping skills. This takes you away the freedom of exploring, a bit.\n\nLike in RE5 there are blue emblems that you can shoot in order to unlock files and figures. The bad thing is, that unlike in RE5, the emblems you shoot, will appear again if you play through that chapter again.\nYou will encounter enemies that are like the Urobors soldiers at the end of RE 5, and yes they have guns. The only good thing are zombies, especially when they come in large numbers. There are some different special zombies like a big fat one and a really big fat one. There are zombies with red eyes which mutate and zombies that scream to attract other zombies.\nThe B.O.W.s are mostly boring and/or annoying. They are mostly disgustingly slimy. There were slimy enemies in previous installments of the game, but here, they're exaggerating. Even worse than in RE 5. One of the most annoying things are, that  even zombies  disappear after killing them. Most of the boss fights are slimy and slobbery. You will find yourself in situatuons where you think  Am I still playing Resident Evil?  The only cool thing is, that you encounter protagonists from the other campaigns and share even bossfights with sometimes. That means you will fight some bosses twice.  To the helicopter part I mentioned before.  There are even helicopters as enemies and you will even use one.\n\nEvery campaign has two playable characters, except Ada.I woun't tell you story elements, but I will tell you how each campaign felt for me. If you don't want to get biased, then you should skip the next parts with the campaign headlines.\n\nLeon\nYou start in a university. It's pretty dark and you walk around, searching a way to get out of there. Here you slightly get the  Racoon City flair . Later you'll get in the city and it looks like you're in Racoon City again. Later you get to a cathedral and from this point on, you should turn the game off. You will encounter numerous places where you think  Why didn't anybody notice this before?  or  How the hell did I get from that place to this place?. From the cathedral on a plane that heads to China. The game trailers make you think this will be a survival horror, like in the good 'ol days but in third person where you have to aim yourself. You will end up throwing ammo away in order to pick up something else and kill one enemy after another.\n\nChris\nThe worst campaign is Chris Redfield's campaign. This feels like Gears of War. Running, shooting, enemies who shoot back, B.O.W.s who are slimy and  absolutely no classic zombies!  I ♥♥♥♥ you not! Not even a single infected human throughout the whole campaign! This has nothing to with Resident Evil anymore.\n\nJake\nThe new character Jake Muller has a known partner Sherry Birkin from Resident Evil 2. In this campaign you get partially a similar flair from Resident Evil 3, because a Nemesis-like B.O.W. is hunting you (and he's the only boss in the game which isn't slimy). The bad thing is, you don't encounter this guy randomly like Nemesis. You will find out story elements in this campaign which bring up even more questions. By the way, there aren't classic zombies in this campaign either.\n\nAda\nThis campaign has a stealthy flair in the beginning and harder puzzles than the other campaigns. The whole campaign feels more challenging. You will get annoyed by Ada's  coolness  pretty soon. There are zombies here again but not as much as in Leon's campaign.\n\nConclusion\nYou  have to be a fan  of the franchise in order to go on playing this game after the disillusionment of the Leon campaign which is the top campaign, therefore you pick this one first. You play a part of this campaign in the prelude anyway. In Resident Evil 5 you were","July 19, 2014","false","34.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Do missions in the order they appear; Leon, Chris, etc. I thought you chose one character and played the whole game with that person and skill set. I chose Ada, the last character, and it was incredibly difficult with hardly any ammo. Sheer desperation made me mention how hard it was in a forum, and I was told start with Leon.\n\nThe game is cram packed full of cut-scenes, either long or short. The short ones are on average about every two minutes. It constantly pulls control away from the player. It might just be that  the ground rocks, but then you lose control, the camera sways, and the character wobbles. Then you have to press your control keys again to get going. There are parts of the game where it happens less, then there parts when it's non-stop. There are even times when it takes camera angle control from you and expects you to carry on.\n\nOver-all though it is a constant wrangle to maintain control. When you get to a ledge, you can't just jump up it. You have to wait for it to say 'space', then you can press space and jump up. Nearly everything is controlled in this way throughout. Endless, endless pressing keys.\n\nThat brings you onto the quick-time-events. Non-stop button mashing that has nothing to do with normal control. It's Ok to an extent, but even the most patient person gets annoyed. You think, "what is this for".\n\nThen onto how difficult it can be. There is one part I recall. 3rd Chris chapter, you have to run across a load of boats and moorings. You have to make it within time, or wherever you are you die. Checkpoints make you repeat it until you get it right. I can not tell you how bad that whole event was. I was screaming. (Not the only time I was screaming in this game either.)\n\n5/10 is generous, but I don't quite think it's a 4/10. It's strong points are that sometimes the combat is great. The sets can be OK, but mostly they are dimly lit. The cathedral chapter in the Leon campaign is epic. If only they had made the whole game like that.\n\nThe bosses are just unbelievably annoying. The Leon boss kept coming back at various latter stages of the Leon missions. I became sick of the sight of it, and sick of shooting it. Completely stupid method to kill it. I had to search online to find out how. What they have done is build up the difficulty over each character's campaign. Only it doesn't work. It feels like catastrophic insulting garbage from the developers, and you want blood as compensation. They try to make it a huge experience. However all it does is fall flat on it's face by kicking you in the teeth non-stop.\n\nFalling over is something that happens a lot with your character. Endless boom, flat on your back. It's noisy a lot. In fact they should have called the game - 'Boom, flat on your back'. I honestly don't know if I can finish it. I have given it a good go. I sold RE5 (CD-copy) unfinished as well.","November 13, 2014","false","31.1"," 83 of 155 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","83","155","5","0"

I figured I'd share my latest review for Resident Evil 6 with those that are interested in the game.\n\nTo be complete honest the game is mediocre at best and filled with tons of cliches and cheese. The checkpoint/autosave system is atroscious and the game has no ability to pause during gameplay. The game feels really lacking in uniqueness and it feels like Capcom isn't really trying anymore, too much focus was put into it's graphics and not enough effort was done in making the game unique. The boss was lame and felt like he was there just to drag the game on further and being the only boss there it felt pointless fighting him. While the combat system is definitely improved over 5 the game as a whole feels watered down and tasteless. I wouldn't really recommend the game unless you're a die-hard fan of zombies or Resident Evil.\n\nIf you'd like to read our full review for the game you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/resident-evil-6-overview-review/\n\nThanks for reading, happy gaming!","January 8, 2014","false","12.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/recommended/221040/","CounterLife","« Counter-Life™ »","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/","98 products in account","Not for 30 bucks.\n\nNever.\n\nThis is probably the worst Resident Evil game, tied with ORC.\n\nStarting with the gameplay. It's a mess, you can slide, make jumps to the right or left, roll over and throw yourself on your back. Besides the slide move I've never used any of these moves during my first playthrough, because they feel so unnecessary and out of place. Gunplay is downright horrible. You have a crosshair with a dot inside, which will jump all over the place after you shot your gun. The problem is that the dot will stay at a random position inside the crosshair, it won't be at the center. The recoil of a shot only pushes your crosshair upwards, guns feel like toys without any force.\nDid I mention it doesen't have licensed guns? Capcom said that fans of RE4 requested more realistic guns, That is why RE5 had so many awesome realistic guns (except for the upgrades of course). In RE6 we get guns called "Bear Commander" or "Wing Shot". Resident Evil was always fairly realistic when it came to guns.\nQTE's everywhere, you can disable most of them but why did they even add them in the first place then?\nThe vehicle segments are horrible aswell. There's too many of them and the controls are super awkward. Fyling a jet or helicopter feels like playing table hockey.\n\nNow for the graphics. Yet another step backwards from RE5. The only thing that looks decent are the character models, everything else ranges from 2002 to 2008 level graphics. Gun models are super low-poly, same goes for most texture resolutions.\nDon't believe me? Check these out:\nRaw Lightning Hawk model/textures[www.imfdb.org]\nLow quality environments\nSkybox texture a la Deus Ex (2000)\n\nI don't want to bash a game due to it's graphics, but considering that RE5 had much better graphics...there's no excuse for that, Capcom.\nFurthermore, we get some "high quality" level design , like pillars in front of consoles (see pic) or corridors that lead to nowhere.\n\nNow for the worst part...the plot. Seriously, you thought RE5's plot was bad with Jill's mind control and Wesker becoming some god complex villain? Trust me, this game puts "bad writing" on a whole new level. The dialogue, the cutscenes, the characters...just everything. It's not even "funny" bad like the voice acting of the first game, it's just plain bad. Chris is now a drinker and Leon's voice seems halfway faded. I miss the "No thanks, bro." kind of guy. I think the character that stayed the most true to it's former self was HANNIGAN, and she has like 4 minutes of screen time.\n\nNow I'll talk about the decent parts of the game.\n\nThe best part of the game is the mercenaries mode. There you just aim for the highest score possible, without the stupid plot being constantly showed into your face or dumb vehicle segments.\nPersonally, I still prefer RE5's and even Mercs3D (yep, that game for the Nintendo 3DS) mercenaries modes over RE6's because of the basic gameplay, but from a mechanical standpoint (like killing a specific amount of enemies in a specific time window will trigger a boss to spawn) you can't deny that RE6's mercs is the most developed one (thanks to Dfactor for some explanation).\n\nNext thing is the melee system. Now, I'm not saying that it's good, I'm saying that it's okay-ish.\nWhile it can be fun to throw an enemy at another one and seeing them both smashing into a table, it just feels out of place and even overpowered. You can melee ANYTIME, which is my biggest point of criticism on the melee system. It's just way too focused on melee combat overall, which makes me think "Resident Fighter VI" would have been a more appropriate name.\n\nLastly, the amount of content. My first playthrough of all campaigns took me about 20 hours. Now that would be a big + if the game itself wasn't bad, and if I didn't have to force myself through the last two campaigns.\n\nThat's the end of this review. If you really want to try this game, then get it during a sale.\nI know it seems like I'm hating on this game, and yeah, I am. I don't even deny it, I hate on it and for good reason.","November 1, 2015","false","38.1"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","56","104","5","18"

Unfortunately it is also, in my honest opinion, the worst one of them all.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\nThere are a lot and I do mean a LOT of QTE's(quick time events) in this game! QTE's are not a bad thing when done properly. But, when you need a QTE for pretty much everything from opening doors, leap over and across obstacles, fending off zombies, fighting bosses, dodging attacks, etc'... Then it becomes a chore and most of the time just frustrating. Some QTE's will get you killed when thrown at you and you were expected to react in a superhuman speed! It felt like the designers just wanted you to fail and die in some parts of the game... speaking of.. look out an ambulance........BAM YOU'RE DEAD!\n\nBullet sponge enemies will make you beg for ammo and when you actually find some crates you will be disappointed to discover skill points instead of ammo which you desperately needed. Some parts of the game are just 3rd person shooter which is OK, but when it's done with scarce ammunition system from a horror game than it is just a BAD game design!\n\nA lot of the time I felt like the game just doesn't want me there. Constantly striping me of control over my cherector, taking away control over the camera, making me trip over dead bodys(which I found to be the most stupid thing I have ever seen in a game!), knocking me down when bullets hit me(You will spend a lot of time on your back when playing Leon's compaign).\n\nWhat is it with RE games and the lack of boss health bar?? For once I would have loved to know how am I doing! Am I supposed to be shooting that big-♥♥♥ monster or run away? The game does terrible job at telling you when it's time to fight and when it's time to run or what you're supposed to do in that matter.\n\nThe cover system is horrible and most of the time just useless because the game spawns monsters behind you as well as in front of you.\nWeapons upgrade system is gone and replaced with a useless and not very rewarding skill system in which you can only equipped 3 at a time. You will need to grind a lot to upgrade everything.\nBoss fights are terrible, you will be forced to beat the same boss again and again and again and well.. you get the point.\n\nI can't say much about the story because I was playing with a buddy and I wasn't following it that much. But what I do want to say is that fighting the same boss  twice with diffrent characters just because you came across these two other characters you played in a previous campaign is just dumm game design!\n\nThings I like:\n- Clever enemy design. I liked the fact that some enemies evolve after you shot them but at the same time it was very annoying because you are very limited with your ammo and you just want them to freaking die already, again that is just poor game design!\n\nGameplay: 2/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound design and music: 4/10\nStory: 2/10\nFinal verdict: 3.5/10\n\nEdit: The co-op in Ada wong's compaign is just terrible!!! Your partner has absolutely no intersection with the world what so ever!!! You just stand there and watch your friend play the game!\n\nResident Evil R.I.P!","February 26, 2014","false","38.5"," 31 of 56 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","31","56","0","8"

(tap button infinitly to do this, tap buttons in rhythm to do that, etc)\n- The game often messes with the camera or strips you of control either to focus your attention on something or to show you a small, pointless cutscene.\n- Game mechanics aren't well realized: cover is useless, sliding is useless (good for breaking boxes though), dodging is almost useless, skill system is limiting at best, Combat Gauge bar needs deeper integration.\n- Atrocious inventory and inventory managment: you have to fumble through weapons/items with the wheel or with prev/next hotkeys like it's 1999.

RE games are supposed to make you feel restricted in movement. It is what makes them hard. CAPCOM did a nice job finding the balance of old RE4 and the new combat mechanics for RE6.   Player satisfaction is high when achieving that awesome melee attack after stunning your enemy or counterattacking(bloodshots am I right??? :)  I hope they continue to improve on responsiveness when executing certain actions.\n\nRE6 is not really big on the horror. There are points when you may feel some urgency to get things perfectly executed but no beads of sweat should be dripping.  Not too many jumpscares.  Jumpscares are really only good the first time around then you can anticipate them,   If you want some RE style jumpscares I recommend RE4(for similar mechanics) , or RE2.\n\nOne thing I didnt like was the QTEs.   CAPCOM decided to go nuts on Leon's campaign with it,  Im glad the other campaigns had very little.   Sometimes you just want to sit back and enjoy some story but not be immersed into a sudden button press that you will miss and die from.\n\n2013 graphics compared to 2015 graphics....

(Thankfully! No more notorious AI Partner deaths!)\n+ Huge variety of enemies and bosses - From the classic zombies to the J'avo. (J'avo are infected humans, similar to the Las Plagas from RE4 and can carry weapons and feature many mutations)\n+ Each of the 4 major campaign offers different atmosphere / theme:\n++ Leon's campaign has the dark classic theme - contains zombies, dark corridors and is closest to Resident Evil 1 and 2.\n++ Chris's campaign has the World-War-style acton shooting theme - the most "american" of all 4 campaigns, and is close to Resident Evil 5 in terms of action and shooting.\n++ Jake's campaign has the Tyrant theme. You are being chased by a Tyrant-type of monster like in Resident Evil 3.\n++ Ada's campaign... well, for this one... I leave this to you to see what it is all about.\n+ Character/Story crossovers - during the story you meet some of the other protagonists, controlled by others or the AI.\n+ Skill system, that allows you to influence various aspects of the gameplay.\n+ Different graphical UI styles for the inventory and menus. Each of the 4 campaigns will have different visual UI style, as if you are playing a completely different game.\n+ Herbs and ammo boxes are here like usual! Lets refresh our memory. 1 Green Herb + 1 Red Herb, what does it do? :)\n+ Melee combat moves / Extended combat system for certain characters.\n+ Dashing and running system.\n+ Excellent Dodge system. With proper timing, you can dodge almost any enemy/boss attack in the game, if done right. This allows you to leave the battleS unscratched!\n+ Each of the 7 protagonists have their signature weapons and moves which others cannot obtain/learn. Ada for example has her trademark weapon, the famous crossbow, when Sherry has her unique Stun Rod and Jake is skilled in the Martial Arts and can deliver great blows with his bare hands, etc.\n\nCons:\n- Your weapons and firearms cannot be customized, upgraded or improved. The ability of upgrading your gun stats, from Resident Evil 2, 4 and 5, has been removed completely from Resident Evil 6. This means, with simple words, that, whatever weapons you may have, will stay the same forever.\n- Camera is your biggest enemy. Causes troubles at times, especially when you need it to stay on your character's back but it doesn't. Super annoying!\n- During cutscenes, the player's character can die. When a cutscene plays, your character will stay frozen solid, but the enemies will not. This means, if it happens there to be enemies nearby when a cutscene triggers, they can (and will) attack your character and kill him! And, no, it is not possible to defend your character from these hostile attacks, as you will have to wait for the entire cutscene to finish playing (!) and then for the camera to return back to its position over the character's shoulder (!) before you can resume control of your character. And if you see the Game Over screen after the cutscene, it means your character got killed and that you will have to start all over again... How shameful of Capcom's part to let a such oversight in a modern-day videogame like Resident Evil 6 to happen. Trully shameful. The Game Over screens right after cutscenes shows how poor job Capcom has done with Resident Evil 6.\n- Most cutscenes can be skipped, but there is a good amount of them that cannot be skipped at all when the appropriate button is pressed.\n- Way too many Quick Time Events. At least x10 times more QTEs than in Resident Evil 4.\n- The game is trying hard to impress the player by adopting a Hollywood-style gaming  experience, at the expense of the player's own joy and comfort. Too many explosions and destruction in the surroundings, (such as cars blowing off, etc), can get repetitive and boring... And the camera leaves your character's shoulder way too often...\n- AI is very stupid and poorly written. Enemies could come for you, pass by you, and then forget about you,\n- Your partner has "body mass" and thus, you cant walk through him. This often leads in him blocking your path, especially in narrow areas and corridors. The problem here is that, due to the stupidity of the AI, he wont realize that he is blocking you from passing through a door, and thus, he won't give a ♥♥♥♥ about that. For example If you want to pass through a narrow door (narrow = wide enough for just only 1 person to pass through it) and it happens that your partner is standing in the middle of that narrow door, you wont be able to pass, well, at least not right away... So, if you are in the middle of a gunfight and you want to get past a door for cover from hostile fire, your AI partner may prevent you from doing so, and thus, increasing the risk of you dying or getting hurt, especially on the higher difficulties...\n- The Cover system (Cover = taking shelter behind obstacles such as fences, corners and walls to protect yourself from enemy fire) could have been better... You enter into Cover Mode even when you don't want it, all just because Capcom decided that it was very practical to have the button for the Take Cover to be merged with the button for Weapon Aiming! Yes, you read right: if you hold the Aim button to shoot at an enemy with your firearm, but your character position happens to be near a corner, a crate, a fence or an wall, you will, instead of aiming + shooting, go into Cover Mode even if this was not your intention... how frustating! Capcom, you screwed it...\n- The game's story spans 3 continents (America, Europe, Asia), but it lacks any depth. It could have been better.\n- Your partner, when he is controlled by the AI, will rarely use the dash ability unless it is scripted to do so. This can be a problem, especially if you are seeking to get good timing scores / planning to do a speedrun in  chapters that feature very long corridors and paths.\n- Graphics could have been better. The game allows you to visit many different places, such as cities, mountains, ships, etc, but the graphics in some of these places feel really outdated...\n- It is not a survival horror title, despite its name. It is an action shooter title. It seems that Capcom took Resident Evil 5 and added a tons more unecessary action to its successor, distancing Resident Evil 6 even further from the series's successful and memorable roots.\n- No costumes or extra weapons unlocked once you beat the game.\n\n\nCapcom has utterly failed all my expectations for this game. Story is poor, no gun upgrades besides using skills, etc... But, at least, it got some funny steam achievements. And as a true Resident Evil fan and an Achievement completionist, I cant help but play this game for at least 400 not-so-entertaining hours. But once all the 50 Single Player Mode achievements are unlocked, I am gonna uninstall the game. And I mean it. The game is having problems and it isnt really worth of taking disk space in your computer if what you seek is to enjoy and experience a true successor of Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 4... Lets pray that Capcom wont repeat the same mistakes with the upcoming Resident Evil 7 title. We can hope that the Resident Evil Revelations or the Resident Evil 4 will be used by Capcom as examples on how to make a true AAA Resident Evil game title... We can hope at least... After all, hope dies last.","January 30","false","425.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Yes, the game is not scary, but that's because Capcom have finally realized that if they want to make a action game, they make a action game without forcing clunky horror game controls on a game focused on kicking zombies heads off with flip kicks. Don't get me wrong, I love Resident Evil REmake/Zero, but it's better this way if they really want to make Resident Evil a action series.\n\nThe content in this game is amazing. With 4 long campaigns to play with Rankings, collectibles and Co-op the replay value is very high and with a long play time even if you play alone. There's also Mercenaries which is very enjoyable, and a bunch of other online modes (which truth to be told I didn't give a single crap about, I thought it was unnecessary and that development time should have been spent somewhere else)\nOne thing I liked with the game was that every character is feels different and unique from each other, with small touches like the menu being a different layout/style in every campaign. The Graphics in the game is AMAZING, and the optimization is silky smooth with even low-end machines being able to run it decently.\n\nAnd now for some complaints. Some of the deaths in the game are very cheap. The ranking system which implies that you need to play EVERY character on EVERY difficulty is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, what were they thinking? And the last and biggest complaint is of course, it's not scary, at all. Leon's campaign started out good with suspenseful atmosphere and promise of the game being scary, but that quickly shatters when Leon leaves the collage and that atmosphere never returns (except a few intense chases in one of the other campaign) Pity.\n\nBut in the end I recommend this game for those who like action fun,  so go get a buddy and play this cheesy pile of cheese. If you want good horror, look somewhere else. Resident Evil Remake (wait for the HD re-release coming soon) and Zero is a good choice, Revelations if you want a modern Resident Evil.","August 7, 2014","true","43.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Resident Evil 6 is both great and horrible in so many ways I won't be able to go over them all but for that reason alone I feel it's a game for anyone who considers themselves a "gamer" should play at least once to see what I mean.\n\nRE6 is an action title with the occasional horror aesthetic thrown in to tie itself in whith its lineage. While best played with a friend it's very much playable solo. Players will take control one of 3 pairs of characters (or possibly an additional duo or a single character for the fourth campaign) as they experience the story of the game from three different perspectives and this is where the idea of the mixed bag begins. Instead of a single cohearent script, its divided amoungst three different stories that constantly leaves the player confused and in a stupor. Even with all the campaigns completed I had to read some of the in-game lore from the easily missed extras menu once I shot enough blue emblems in the game. While the Resident Evil series isn't known for its story, previous entries were at least easy to understand, not the case with this title, often throwing characters at the player that even veterans have no idea as to who they are.\n\nControling the characters is another issue for this game. In many games designed with a controller in mind, often times a button is used as a modifier for every other button. In previous games, what would be holding down the left trigger would then make the character aim at which point the right will fire. While that is a simple method, RE6 has layers of these that are poorly explained if at all. New players should take their time figuring out the controls as even into my second campaign I was still learning what certain combinations of buttons and motions did. However once learned, the complex control scheme actually makes for excellent stylish feats but not everyone will get used to them.\n\nProbably one of the best things about the title is how it can incorporate multiplayer into the campaign. With certain options selected, a player can allow others online to join the game as a co op partner, random players to take control of basic enemies for a little extra challange, and even run into other players who are in other campaigns in overlapping story sections where up to four players can take on a segment of their campaigns together. The only problem with this is that due to the small playerbase many of these things wont happen without coordination with other players such as through Steam groups.\n\nWhile there is definitly more to say I feel that these are some of the biggest issues. I do enjoy the game despite all its faults, however I will say that it may be my least favorite of the RE series that I have experienced. Many others damn this game as complete garbage, and while not all of their complaints are invalid or wrong, it does have entertainment value and some excellent points. If you are looking for a coop third-person action title, there are not many on the market but you should not settle for this unless you are already played through better titles. Give it a look but be aware it is flawed.","September 23, 2014","true","62.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It is not a very good game either.\n\nIn Resident Evil 6, there are 4 different storylines: Leon and Helena, Jake and Sherry, Ada (and "agent"), and Chris and some weird kid. After you play through two of them (I played Leon and Helena and Jake and Sherry), the game gets very repetitive and dull. The odd thing is that, none of the campaigns are really the same. Storywise, they meet at the same events but they are four different people in different areas with different bosses. It's difficult to describe. (The Ada campaign is pretty much a very difficult single-player mission. However it can be played coop with an "agent.").\n\nWhat I absolutely dislike about this game are the controls. They are one of the worst I have ever dealt with since there are so many. If they made the game less of an "over the shoulder" perspective and more "free movement" then I have no problems. But you can't. It's locked into that position and you can't see or move easily especially with the poor controls. The covering system is just beyond bad. You will cover behind anything and even up to walls if you aim (and are close) enough to it. The camera changes sometimes into the weirdest perspectives too and it becomes very hard to see where you're going.\n\nThis is the second RE game I've played after RE4 on my Playstation 2 and it's very "meh." I didn't like the aim scheme then, and I didn't like it now. They don't even tell you how to use herbs, they're just there. Combine them or use them, there is no difference.\n\nObligatory Score: 6/10\n\nAdd: Oh and this game is dark, very dark. Turn up that brightness if you can.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot to put this in. There are parts of the game that have QTE (quick time events) and they are the most annoying thing to grace this Earth.

This can makes the game campaigns feel slightly lazy in comparison to previous games. However, other than the final campaign mission that was offered as dlc, each campaign is approximately 4 hours long. You couple the repetitiveness of the main campaign with some very Bollywood action sequences and it really is a toss-up whether or not you will enjoy it. Personally, I had no problem with it because if you can accept monsters, mutants, and zombies then you might as well suspend disbelief on the rest as well.\n\nWhere the game really REALLY shines is the mobility of play style and improved combat system. There is sliding, rolling, jumping onto your back, running (like really running, not just the light jog from previous games), countering attacks, and a bit more.\n\nOh and it has LOCAL COOP, the fact is, if you have one friend, just one friend that will visit you to play games Resident Evil 6 is fantastic. Sure, the way the split screen works is a bit funky and very poorly implemented but I personally have zero problems with it. Therefore, if you have a single friend to play games with and an extra controller I promise you your game play will generally be a lot of fun. However, if you play Resident Evil 6 alone, the game will be a bit of a slog at times.\n\nDespite some obvious negatives you do get your money's worth when purchasing this game.","January 8","true","94.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's got an entertaining story that intersects through the 4 campaigns. The wide range of  difficulty levels allows even the weakest of Co-Op partners to still enjoy the game. You can do split-screen on lan and control the game with one keyboard/mouse and one Xbox controller, or two Xbox controllers.\n\nMultiple copies of the game can also play Co-Op over the internet, and you can invite people off your steam list to join you provided they own the game. If you are playing an online game, you may find certain sections where 2 online co-op partners may also join your game for a 4 player story-based event or boss battle.\n\nRegardless as to whether you are playing Split Screen or Internet, you have an option for your game called Agent Hunt that will make the game harder if you decide to turn it on, explained below.\n\nThere is one and only one REAL downside to this game that I have experienced, QTEs or QuickTimeEvents; the release for this game was blasted in reviews for it's QTEs where you'd have to mash buttons during cutscenes. If QTEs are not too your liking you can enable "Auto Action Button" in the menu as of a recent update, yup, they fixed it!\n\nFor players whom want to be competitive, there are two mutliplayer modes in addition to Co-Op. The most well known is Mercenaries where you can fight in Deathmatch against one another...\n\nHowever where the fun really came in for me was in the AGENT HUNT mode, where you join another player's campaign as a zombie, and you and your fellow zombie players are tasked with hunting down and killing the human player(s). You naturally move a LOT slower than them, but you can make up for that with quick-travel vents and other holes that human players can't move through. How you win? MAKE THE HUMAN PLAYERS DIE OR FAIL!\n\nIf you choose to register at residentevil . net\nit will keep track of all your player records, and you will earn EXP toward "Agent Levels" that can be used to unlock costumes and other bonus content. The website will also host "events" every week that players can participate in. The winner of an event will have that win permanently placed on their profile.\n\nAs with many, many other games the true value in it is using it as a social tool, co-op, death match, or agent hunt all make the game great.","March 26, 2013","true","45.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/recommended/221040/","sandra_afrika","Lars Alexandersson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/","244 products in account","Story: 8.5/10\nI found the story to be enjoyable and keeps to the main idea of zombie outbreaks. Yet, the story kept me hooked thanks to reintroducing old favourites in the Resident Evil cast such as the likes of Leon Kennedy, Sherry Birkin, Chris Redfield and Ada Wong whilst introducing new characters with more unique personalities like Jake Muller. The story is quite lengthy but the interesting story makes up for it.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe gameplay may have changed drastically where gunfights and brawls are the main whilst the horror element has diminished in comparison to previous Resident Evil titles which puts off most Hardcore RE fans who came for the scares and suspense but it's still a great game nevertheless since the number of actions you can pull off have risen. They should have implemented skills like rolling, dodging (when you want to) and countering. The challenging part of RE6 is pulling off counters at the correct time since the prompt only appears for a split second before you miss the prompt and lose some health. QTE's are common throughout the game which I'm not a big fan of since the controls are a bit clunky and the buttons fail to register even though i press them clearly but they make it more challenging and forces the player to stop being a lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and do something about it. Co-op in this game is really fun when playing with friends and talking via voicechat. The Mercenaries gamemode makes a return and new gamemodes such as Siege and Survivors make the game replayable and competitive to play.\n\nControls: 6/10\nAs mentioned before, the controls are a bit clunky since sometimes buttons you hit don't register properly or on time which is expected of a PC port from consoles. All the controls ingame are evident of this however Capcom kindly gave PC players shortcuts (most likely after several patches) to commands which would have taken multiple keys to carry out before. Crouching has been binded to 2, Rolling to 3 and Mixing Herbs to H which saves us so much time when we're in a pickle.\n\nSounds/Music: 7/10\nThe sounds are great and the music is underrated. I think that there are some wonderful soundtracks in there but most of the songs are slightly lacking in contrast to classic RE games like Resident Evil and RE3. Gun sounds are on point and the ambience really reflects on the mood of the game.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nI'm pretty fond of the graphics in this game. Looking back at old RE games, I can really see that Resident Evil has come so far since the first release back in 1996. Though the graphics have improved immensely, it still doesn't compare to most titles nowadays or even games released back in 2012/2013\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nIn short, get this game when it's on sale, especially the complete edition since there are DLCs but I would definitely recommend this game.","December 27, 2015","true","36.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/221040/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Resident Evil 6 (RE6) is the third Resident Evil game I’ve played (only played 4, 5, and 6 since I don’t have a Playstation). The game has a relatively low metacritic rating (69 last I checked) but I found it to be exactly what I expected after playing RE5 a year earlier. If you’ve only seen the Resident Evil movies then you may not be aware that the games have a completely different storyline and I think they’ve been retconned a few times as well.  You would probably recognize a bunch of the characters though since almost every Resident Evil character I know appears in RE6.\n\nThe game is a third person “over the shoulder” game played in coop with another person. Just like Resident Evil 5, if you don’t have a friend playing with you, the computer controls the other guy. There are 4 campaigns for you to play and in each of them you can play one of the 2 characters. The campaigns all intersect multiple times so you might be playing the Leon campaign and run in to Chris Redfield. Then when you’re playing the Chris campaign you run into Leon and play as the other side of the encounter. It’s a great way to see the plot from various viewpoints and you’ll understand why characters are acting in a certain way. After you’ve completed the game you can go back and play as the second character in each campaign as well. There’s over 50 hours of gameplay to be had in single player alone. Each campaign is divided into chapters and each chapter into sections, for example Leon Campaign Chapter 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc. The game saves at checkpoints during each section, so if you’re knocked out and your partner doesn’t revive you in time, you restart at the checkpoint. Your inventory is saved between sections and you can replay previous sections freely. There is no more “inventory screen,” now it’s just a quick menu where you hold a button to display and scroll through your items. There is no level up system, but you can gather “exp” points to unlock perks such as improved damage or better aim stability. Then you can pick which 3 perks you want equipped between missions. So you can replay levels over and over for more exp or replay some of the bosses a few times for fun.\n\nI believe the complaint that a lot of Resident Evil purists had was that beginning with RE5, the games aren’t really “survival horror” anymore. Now the focus is on action and shooting. I remember in RE4 that conserving ammunition was a big challenge so you use melee attacks as much as possible. The melee system has been enhanced a great deal since then and ammunition has become a lot more plentiful (you can also replay levels to grab ammo and then just save + quit). You’ll definitely do a lot of shooting, but you should definitely master the hand to hand (or knife fighting depending on which character you’re playing).\n\nStorywise, the game picks up a few years after Resident Evil 5. The world is continuing to circle the drain as various warlords around the world use biological weapons to create zombies and other super powered monsters. Each campaign has its own antagonist though they cross over a lot, as mentioned earlier. If you haven’t played the previous games you might not understand a few “peculiarities” of the playable characters. I certainly didn’t know who some of the people were and the ways that their backstories drive the game’s plot.  It is mostly understandable though if you play the whole game through. Just accept that everyone knows each other from previous games.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent built in co-op play for the campaign, and for different game modes like Mercenaries. Steam sells the “complete pack” that includes everything, kind of like a Game of the Year edition.\n+Very long game (at least 35 hours even if you rush), you’ll get your money’s worth.\n+A lot of replay value (you can unlock “perks” by grinding for exp).\n+You can play as a monster! Join someone’s game and ♥♥♥♥ them up. A few people tried dropping into my brother and my games, but since we were on levels with only normal zombie enemies (so they spawned as normal zombies), we blew them away easily lol.\n\nCons:\n-Multi player is kind of dead now. Hard to find a game to join unless it’s a friend inviting you or vice versa.\n-According to Resident Evil “purists” the game is more action than “survival horror.” If you’re new to Resident Evil games and just looking for a co-op shooter, this won’t bother you.\n-There are a few times when you need to run through an area in a short amount of time (like escaping a giant enemy) and the camera keeps subtly shifting so you slightly change running directions and hit a wall or something, then you die. This is VERY annoying but only happens in a few areas. Most of the time you can play leisurely.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend Resident Evil 6 if you like action games and / or zombie bashing games. The visuals are disturbing and the monsters are grotesque, as expected in a Resident Evil game. The game is 100% better if you have a friend to join your game for coop play. And once you’re done with the campaigns you can spend a lot of time on the various game modes that are included, most especially the Mercenaries mode, which returns from Resident Evil 5. It’s kind of like a survival mode where you try to live to the end of the timer killing as many enemies as you can. The enemy types keep changing until you’re fighting mini bosses.\n","September 19, 2014","true","78.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even after remapping the keys it's a pain. On top of that, game only saves once in a while, checkpoint saves mean nothing, they don't actually save the game, if you leave. Combine this with the fact that there's no actual 'Pause" option for the game, and it makes for a very poor experience.\n\nIt is extremely frustrating playing on PC. Keyboard controls often change when a new camera angle is forced upon you, making several parts of the game extremely frustrating, where one second W is forward and then you have to use S to move forward. Obviously, it happens in sequences where milliseconds will decide if your character will live or die.\n\nUnless you are ready to pay out of pocket for a XBox controler for PC (by the way, this game has ALSO issues with Logitech joysticks, so don't bother using one), don't waste your money on this game.\n\nThis is the WORST RE, and I've played them all.

I have over 100 hours on the Xbox and decided to pick it up for the PC as well.\n\nThe game is being bashed on meta-crtiic, I can only assume that those bad reviews were made by people who did 0 research before buying the game, or even looking at the trailers.\n\nThis is NOT a horror game. Sure, there might be scary moments in Leon's campaign, but do not go into this game thinking you will be scared.\n\nThis is a GREAT action game with a EXCELLENT story, especially for those (like myself) who have a special place in their hearts for the Resident Evil story and characters. You can experience all the goodness with a friend even!\n\nThe BEST thing about this game is the controls; I have NEVER played a game with so much freedom and fluidity in a third person shooter before. I have NEVER been constrained in this game. If someone says it this game has crappy controls then they are simply an idiot who did not take all of 5 minutes learning the controls.\n\nI guess that is the bad thing of this game; the game does not give you a good tutorial about the controls, you have to find out yourself (there are several fairly open areas where you can practice, or you can load up a mercenary mode game and try it out).\n\nThis might not be a good horror game, but it is a GOOD GAME nonetheless.

Subplots make little to no sense. Nothing is explained. Villains are just there because the world needs villains. As for gameplay, the co-op element as fine. I'm OK with that existing but why the overuse of cutscenes while your partner opens a door? Or pulls a lever? Is this game trying to compete with Metal Gear Solid IV? Let us play Capcom!  I cannot even recommend this game for the co-op and I definitely would not recommend playing this game solo. Why does the game need to spell out the objective for us? Or where the entrance to the next area is? This is the same developer that gave us Resident Evil, a huge mansion to explore and solve puzzles and this is the best they can do in 2012?

Even as I got older, I still enjoy going back to the older games and trying them out. As far as the differences between Resident Evil 1 and 6 go, you can't compare the games that much on gameplay. However, one similarity the games share would be the memorable moments I've had with the series. Even with the changes in the audience it's tried to reach (or stumbled across), I still find it a very noteworthy experience. And even from a game like Operation Raccoon City (that is admittedly kinda broken), there were probably more memorable moments playing that than other games like Dead Space 3 or Borderlands 2. It should be noted, I don't play this game by myself (I play with my brother).\n\nAs the mechanics are concerned in this game, it's pretty good. There are moments where I'm stuck huddling against a wall or my view changes while trying to make a hastey escape. I assume the mechanics are designed largely for combat (which fail on occassion) and not much else. Some areas involving stealth I couldn't quite get into them until my second play through of the game. However, the game did introduce the ability to roll and shuffle very well, making your characters feel much more nimble (despite when they've planted their butt on a wall and their face in the crotch of a zombie). The game's not perfect, but it is definitely an improvement over Resident Evil 5's on-rails feel (for lack of a better term).\n\nResident Evil 6 is fun. The campaigns are long and enjoyable. I'm not opposed to quick time events, and found they were the cause of some memorable experiences my first play through this game. The replay value holds up quite well, especially with extra content like The Mercenaries mode. The story is a tad predictable and cliche, and I would (and have) also described it as, "Trying to be too epic."\n\nI also kind of felt it succeeded. Plus, I don't want to trash every story out there merely on the idea it seems like I've seen aspects in it somewhere before.\n\nMy biggest gripes with the game would be the clunky controls. Because of this, there were some parts of the campaigns that I would have prefered being removed or altered.\n\nAs a whole, I recommend this game for anybody looking for a good cooperative playthrough with a sibling or close friend. Just, try not to judge this game on whether it's Resident Evil 1 enough for you.","March 15, 2014","true","89.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Sherry, chris dan leon dari BSFAA , kembali jadi tokoh utama untuk mengembalikan kestabilan dunia dengan mencari penyembuh dari virus ini , ditambah dengan tokoh cantik yang misterius si Ada Wong yang suka bermain di air keruh. Di game ini juga disimpulkan siapa sebenarnya ada waong itu , dan siapa si jake itu, yang masih ada hubunganya dengan serial RE sebelumnya.\nGAMEPLAY\nCampaign dibagi menjadi 4 campaign dengan memainkan 4 karakter berbeda. yaitu Leon dengan sidekicknya Helena, Chris dengan sidekicknya Rick (lupa gan) , Jake dengan Sidekicknya Sherry dan Ada wong dengan sidekicknya petugas neo umbrella .  yang menarik setiap campaign mempunyai benang merah dengan campaign2 lainya. Jadi kalo kamu memainkan campaign leon ada cutscene dimana nanti kamu bertemu dengan chris dan jake, sherry dan ada. Dan begitu juga bila kamu main campaign chris , ada cutscene dimana kamu bertemu dengan leon, jake dan ada.\nYang unik , setiap campaign acak, kamu bisa mulai dari character yang mana kamu suka. Ntah itu chris, leon , jake or ada. No problem. Atau bayangkan dirimu menonton film, disebuah film ada empat cerita berbeda yang berjalan secara paralel yang mempunyai akhir2 yang berbeda, tetapi satu tujuan untuk menyalamatkan umat manusia dari virus keji. Ketegangan ala2 horor yang dibangun standard lah , kalo pemain yang sudah maen RE ini, ga lebih serem dibanding game2 horor lainya.\nGRAFIS:\ncocoknya buat pc dengan spec med- end  kalo mau maenya enak , tanpa patah2. Cukup kerenlah, misalnya kalo basah abis berenang, efek2 basah2anya terlihat nyata. Ekspresi character terlihat jelas, dan cutscene2nya  lumayan menghibur.\nSOUND:\nStandard game action horror gan, kalo lagi alurnya lambat , musiknya kalem, kalo lagi tegang2nya , ato perang2, background soundya  pacenya cepat.\n+PROS :\n1.	Multiplayernya asoy gan, bisa coop campaign, jadi bisa minta tolong temen buat nyelesain campaign entah itu local coop (1 komputer 2 player dengan split screen) ato onlince coop dan ga ribet, tinggal pencet R, buat invite temen.\n2.	Bagi yang membeli DLC , banyak mode2 game lain selain campaign, jadinya ga gampang bosen\n3.	Mempunyai nilai replayable yang  tinggi, karena walaupun kamu udah selesaikan 4 campaign, masih banyak achivement yang masih unlock dan skill2 yang masih belum terbuka.\nCONS :\n1. Savean cuman di chapter2 tertentu saja, ga bisa pencet F5 buat save , ato quick save, jadi kalo mati , ngulangnya agak2 jauh.\n2. Kadan♥♥♥♥da aksi2 dengan angle kamera yang bikin kagok dan menyebalkan, jadinya harus ada penyesuaian dulu.\n3. Makan hardisk lumayan banyak diatas 20GB an\n4. Harga mahal gan di SteamS tore , $40 gan, beli kalo lagi ada sale aja, ato cari2lah seller lagi kasih harga spesial.\n5. Ga ada fasilitas in chat dalam game.\nKesimpulan :\nBuat penggemar seri  RE, harus punya nih.  Disaranin beli ori gan, supaya maen multiplayernya lebih enak ga perlu ribet. Btw maen RE 6 bareng ane gan\nIni id ane :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093867839\n\n\n","February 4, 2014","true","51.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","3"

It took almost 100 hours for me to get use to controls. The game itself is very replayable, fits perfectly for people like me, but if you are the type who likes to complete the whole game in 15-20 hours, you will be bored quickly. In previous series I was disappointed about the fact, that you cannot punch nearby zombies. So far this is the only game in the series where you can initiate physical attacks without having to daze the enemy first. I only hate that every character has his own weapons, but even this can be fixed, if you know how ;)\nMercenaries brought tons of fun to me. Bad thing is that extra skins for each character are terrible.\nI didn't expect any good game to come out since Left 4 Dead with good versus mode. But RE6 is another one like this. Too bad Capcom are too busy or lazy to fix some bugs like rapid fire from shotguns and sniper rifles which are used by some pubs. In private lobbies it's funny to play using melee only, like Chris vs. Wesker (reskined Jake).

Sure, they brought back real zombies for a campaign, but that's about it. Even then, most of them jump around and ♥♥♥♥ and swing weapons all over the place. No. Thats not how they should work. Inventory management is GONE. Once you pick up a weapon, thats it, you can keep it forever and not worry about switching them out. All you gotta worry about is inventory for ammo, herbs and grenades which doesn't come up much. The other campaigns are the same, but its more like gears of war as enemies are just infected people again with guns. Where's Marcus' dad?\n\nGonna be honest, even for RE the stories are horrible. Jake's Ending? AHAHAHAHAHAHHA no.\n\nAs a game, I did have fun. The movement is really neat, and melee combat is quite nifty. You get a LOT of playtime for every campaign, as there is a lot of story to go through. Agent Hunt is a really neat idea, where you are a zombie and attack players as they do the story, but it's not executed too well, I remember hating it. The stamina mechanic doesn't fit in with the game, but it's quite neat for the mercenaries mode.\n\nMercenaries is what makes this game for me. I've spent hundreds of hours in this gamemode and never get bored of it. It's just fun at its best. If you enjoyed RE5's mercenaries, you're gonna enjoy this just as much. Only complaint about it on PC is that there doesn't seem to be as many levels as on console. I remember buying several map packs for it, and I'm not sure if they're in here, but I doubt it. I'll update this part if I get confirmation.\n\nIt runs really well for me so far, but the FOV seems low and the FOV option didnt seem to change much. It's a solid port.\n\nAll in all, if you're expecting classic resident evil (not likely) turn away. If you loved the mercenaries in RE5, for the love of god buy it. If you like gears of war and stuff, try it out, you might like it.","September 11, 2014","true","33.5"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","1"

I recommend this game for both those who played some/all of the previous games and those who never did. Here is a little summary of the game's features:\n\nCAMPAIGN & PLOT\n\nAfter years and years "playing safe", this time, things really get out of control. Bioterrorist attacks take place in some major places worldwide. This time, just like Raccoon, you get the feeling that you just can't save everyone.\n\nIn this game, you get to see more than meets the eye. You're able to see what hapens "behind the scenes" at certain events, thanks to more immersive cutscenes provided by different campaigns.\n\nStory intersection is another curious feature. I've never seen anything like that in any other game. It is really fun to play with 3 other players in campaign, specially against Ogroman and Ustanak.\n\nOld friends are back, and some revelations are made.\n\nI really liked that they brought Sherry (that's right! It is NOT Ashley, for Christ's sake) back. She was missing since RE2, and all we had after that was an epilogue file in RE3 saying that the US government wanted her. Capcom really loves to disappear with some characters.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS & ADD-ONS\n\nThe combat system has improved a lot since RE5. Dynamic cover, dash, counter attacks, dodge and melee dedicated buttons are in the features list. The most interesting addition, however, is the Skill system. There are tons of things to choose from: enhance your firearm power, melee power, defense, aim, etc. It's very nice.\n\nCO-OP\n\nCo-op mode in RE6 is more dynamic than it was before. The host don't need to restart the game or stop whatever it is that he/she is doing to allow someone in. The lag seems to be less of an evil this time around, but it is still an issue, specially at some QTE events, where the game should sync the players before the scene, but that's not the case everytime.\n\nBut putting that aside, it was a real pity that Capcom got rid of the lobby system for each separate chapter (like 1-2, 3-4, and so on) and the "magic chest" where you could store your items. I find it extremely annoying to always have my inventory full. Got too few space for so much different bullets, herbs and grenades.\n\nDOG TAGS\n\nThat was an interesting add-on. You can customize your dog tag your way to distinguish yourself from other players.\n\nEXTRA CONTENT\n\nIn Agent Hunt mode, you join another player's game as the enemy. Your goal is to kill the player.\n\nMercenaries is back, just like in the previous games. Thankfully, still very familiar. The notable difference is that Coup de Grâce and Counters add more time to the clock.\n\nIf you're a fan of Left 4 Dead, you might want to try Mercenaries No Mercy. I think you'll enjoy.\n\nOnslaught is a fun mode where you kill enemies to send more enemies to your opponent's side. You can't see each other, though.\n\nSurvivors is back, too. But, this time, it is much more fun. You can play with up to 6 players in the same room. Melee moves, little ammo to spare, random spawning weapons and enemies lurking around will turn it into a challenge.\n\nIn Predator mode, you play can play as Ustanak, a virtually indestructible creature, which reminds me a lot of Nemesis. Each turn, someone will play as Ustanak and try to defeat as many Agents as it can. This mode can be played with up to 6 players.","April 24, 2013","true","368.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's hard to explain over all the negative reviews, but I will plea my case the best that I can. This game hits all the right notes until it comes to the parts in the game where you need to drive, or run the gauntlets or from point A to B. That can be a pain for one mistake sends you back. That is the only downfall to this game. The story of all the parties ( don't want to spoil anything) I feel had to take a lot of thought on how to make them interesting, yet come together. The game itself which got rated under Resident evil 5 blows my mind. I know Resident Evil 5 is the last of the classic RE, but RE6 has these things over 5. First instanced Loot,  so if you play with a friend you each get your own loot rather than trying to find out who needs what ammo, or who needs the green herb the most. You can run and shoot, doesn't seem like much, but play RE5 where you are bascially a turrent and you will see why. This is minor, but when you standing infront of object you need the partner to help assist with even that has more interesting options than any previous RE that is Co-Op. Incase you have made it this far and wonder which of the RE series is my favortie that would be Code Veronica.  Which is in the old school style, but besides the first RE it had the second most intrigue behind it, yet you see the return of one of the most infamous villians of all time Albert Wesker.

It is so bad, that it's good. The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics, SFX and overall content is great. Now as for the story line absolutely bonkers of a plotline. You play through several different campaigns of familiar characters as they all interconnect with eachother through the story which gives you wicked cases of Deja Vu. I am not kidding its straight vertigo. Now for the excrement...\n\nThe actual control scheme, camera fixtures and control reacrtions to this game is gawd awful. I mean its a joke because the enemies will be so overwhelming and at times endless that you will be getting thrown around like a ragdoll and knocked down constantly, (I freaking hate the screamers!) constantly throughout the game with the most irky jerky over the shoulder camera ever. The cover system is impressively aggrivating, so is the enemies when you fight them on hiigher difficulties. The game is hilarious. The Co-op is where its at in the most parts, lots of cool modes that are fun if are drunk or high. As for the horror factor? Well hate to break to you all but...IT DOES NOT EXIST HERE. The game has no horror elements, it feels like Call of Duty with zombies with one of the most outlandish story plots. Its like I just watched a Die Hard Movie make love to a Zombie...it is that bad, but that is why this game is still good because it is a complete joke to the resident evil mythology that you will have fun playing just for the sheer idiocy of it like a popcorn flick but a game. 10/10 Will fight the nipple monster again!","March 11","true","63.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Sure, it is different from the previous resident evil and the "lost and found" feeling has gone BUT if you wish to experience something new, then you will find out, you have no reason to avoid it. Its worth how much it is. Put simple, RE6 is not and never a bad game, its just not what the fans expected it to be and thats why the haters were born. Ignore them! Enjoy the game! You will never regret! It does actually beat many popular games.\n\nBtw, I started the franchise since RE3, and I <3 all the series!","June 8, 2013","true","80.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The reason this game got deficated on from a great height on it's release is that it is a great action adventure, but a radical departure from the survival horror feel that made the series great. In it's own right it's a great game, and being able to control monsters to attack other players is a blast, but the atmosphere is action movie horror, not tense suspense survival horror, and I for one was hoping of a more traditional Resident Evil flavor. In short, things go boom here, a lot.

Definitely one of my favourite games I've bought this year. I like the game mechanics, though the odd angles can sometimes be annoying (such as suddenly making me have to use S to go forward when I normally use W) and cause me to die. The storyline is good, besides from the fact that some of  the J'avo mutations are a bit crazy - such as those weird grasshopper things or the many, many times that Simmons changes (I thought he'd never die).\n\nPros:\nStoryline is quite good\nGame mechanics aren't too confusing\nPuzzles were reasonably easy to solve\nInteresting character development (especially in Jake's campaign)\n\nCons:\nCan be a bit overdramatic or repetitive\nOdd angles\nPuzzles were reasonably easy to solve (not a con for me, but could be for you)","December 25, 2014","true","63.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

One of the best of 2013.\nBut the best part about this game, is the mountains of content.\nThere are four separate campaigns, all of them can be done with a friend, each ranging over 5 hours to complete.\nThere are 7  different multi-player modes, all of them enjoyable, and the classic Mercenaries mode makes another return, and it's quite possibly the best version ever made.\nThere's also tons of unlockables and goodies as is the staple of Resident Evil.\n\nThe Gameplay is also impressively unique and fun, Resident Evil 6 has an extremely fluid combat system. Melee combat has been fleshed out, and dodging enemy attacks are much easier with the dodge mechanic. Once you get the hang of it all, you're sure to have a blast.\nSomething that gets on my nerves is the FOV that you can't change, the camera is way too close and personal with you, and it can really hurt you when you're surrounded.\n\nOne thing that seems to bother alot of people are the games quick time events. I never really saw the problem with QTE's, at least they keep you in the game during cutscenes. Some of the most top rated video games use QTE's, I don't understand how they're a bad thing. However, this game has some pretty silly ones, its really just a minor annoyance if you dont like them, you can even turn them off in the options menu\nSpeaking of menus, this game has some pretty terrible menus, navigating through them can be a huge pain, even for a long time player. The in game menu specifically is pretty atrocious, with everything just being an icon instead of words or descriptions.\n\nAnother thing that can ruin your experience is playing alone. Playing with an AI partner is extremely annoying as they don't do even half the things a real partner could do. Alot of the game can be ruined by an AI partner so I recommend getting a friend to play with. And you may need one considering how Resident Evil 6 on PC has an almost completely dead online.\n\nAll in all, its a great game, I recommend it. I also recommend to NOT listen to anyone that says this isn't a Resident Evil game. Being a long time fan, I have no qualms with the direction Resident Evil has taken.

If you view this game as another action TPS than you might definitely enjoy it. The whole story is told through playing each characters campaign. I honestly think they could have done a better job telling the story because at times I was confused. Your going have to play though the entire campaign to really piece the story together.\n\nOther than that the story wasn't anything special to really talk about .

RE4 was not at all bad, It was quite a good game actually, But RE5 really started to go down hill. RE5 was just hordes of zombies you fight and a boss here and there, That's really it, Nothing great with the story. RE6, So far follows that, I figured I would get a few hours out of it.

I WANT SNOWMOBILE CHASES!  I WANT A MOTORCYCLE CHASE WITH A FRIGGIN HELICOPTER COMING AT THE PLAYERS!  THEN, I WANT A PART IN THE GAME WHERE PLAYERS FIGHT A T-REX, FROM A HANG GLIDER!"  And everyone had to listen to him (except for the hang glider part).  It's just absurd.\nThe movement and hand-to-hand combat system is fun as hell, but players may find it difficult to use when the game constantly flashes to tedious cut scenes or forces your camera angle to look at some minuet detail going on in the background.  These interruptions or hiccups in gameplay happen far too often; it was as if the developers were concerned that players might not catch the small details they inserted, so they force you to look at them, every time.  This insecure tactic hurts replay value as many will get tired of being forced to look at the same cosmetic event over and over.\nYou want enjoyment out of this game?  Grit your teeth, play through the storyline, and unlock 'The Mercenaries' mini-game.  The mini-game is the only way you'll get to utilize any good aspects of this action game, unhindered (except, obviously, by the time-limit given).

The games have evolved and change over the years and now the sixth installment of Resident Evil brings back the continued story of the terrible biological experiments conducted by the Umbrella corporation.\n\nThe Good: This game had some of the least painful network I've ever used.  Simply invite a friend from your steam list and off you go!  The graphics for this game are also absolutely exceptional.  Only water looks a little off and even then it is not by much.  A movie done with this games engine would be easy to watch and still be immersed.\n\nThe Bad:  Absolutely Phorking Every-Gord-Dammed-Thing Else!  Resident Evil 6 is the sad, discouraging, despicable end to a wonderful series that will leave a horrible taste in your mouth and keep you wondering how this series could have gone so wrong.  This game has no redeeming qualities other than some clean networking and graphics and, let's face it "good graphics" only mean anything for the first 1-2 years after release at best.  The frustrating and slow, maladroit player controls, the labyrinthian and discouragingly non-intuitive UI, the "thanks-for-that-one-captain-obvious" dialog from start to finish, the excruciating predictability, the painfully relentless stream of cliches and the unentertaining grind of fighting the basic monsters make this game much more of a chore than a game.  I was stunned when I started playing RE6, I thought to myself, "this MUST be a joke, this is SO BAD nobody could have possibly actually though that anyone would play this game and say to themselves 'hey, we've got a solid game here!' but no, it is actually this bad.  The engine for this games feels like your character is extremely dizzy and running through waist deep water, QTE's (which is a whole separate rant I will spare you) absolutely ruin any form of immersion the game could have had.  I am not kidding when I say that there are no redeeming qualities to this game.  The only way I was able to stomach the few hours I lost to this game had nothing to do with the game itself but rather the fact that I had a great co-op buddy to endure this game with.  We were like Tom Servo and Crow from Mystery Science Theater 3000 and made fun of each and every dissapointment this game threw at us.  Much like someone bleeding to death that is telling jokes to stay conscious, humor was the only way we made it to the end of one of the campaigns in this game.  For the love of all that is good and holy DO NOT BUY RESIDENT EVIL 6!  THIS IS A TERRIBLE GAME!  Care to read more about how unbearably bad this game is?  Read Jim Sterling's review on Destructoid, after reading what he had to say and after enduring (not playing or enjoying but enduring) this game for 14 LONG! hours I can honestly say his review is 100% spot on!  (http://www.destructoid.com/review-resident-evil-6-235326.phtml)\n\nThe Funny:  If you are the kind of person who can laugh at horrible jokes AND if you have never played a Resident Evil game before then you will be able to laugh at how poorly the otherwise wonderful Resident Evil series will ends.  If I didn't like the series I'd laugh it off as the death of a fantastic series that was snuffed out just two years before it's 20th aniversary.  Since I did like the series however, I am dissapointed and angry that this tidal wave of frusteration is how Resident Evil goes out.  Imagine the worlds greatest pianist playing Beethoven's 9th symphony and right at the crescendo they stop playing, run over and slap you in the face, take a ♥♥♥♥ on your lap and then give you the finger as they run away screaming ... that's how it feels to like the Resident Evil series and then to have this game be released with the Resident Evil name undeservedly written across it's title screen.\n\nSummary: Seriousley fu(k QTEs, fu(k AAA titles using wonderful old series to turn a quick buck and fu(k who ever was responsible for this God-forsaken train wreck of a game.  If it had been a stand along game that we could all forget that would be one thing but it's not, it's a beloved 18 year old horror-thriller series!  It feels as if Brandon Sanderson replaced the end of the Wheel of Time with a picture of his nut sack (that's not an invitation Brandon, please don't do that and keep up the good work!).  I give Resident Evil 6 a 2 out of 10 and since I had a great co-op partner I give both of those points to us, not to Resident Evil 6, since we were the ones who made some tiny pittance of fun out of a game that offered not one iota of joy by itself.\n\nSummary: 2 out of 10","March 9, 2014","false","13.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

The previous games in the series follow the survival horror genre, while both this and RE5 follow a more action/adventure road with horror aspects thrown into the mix, which lots of people didn't enjoy. Seein' as I haven't played any other Resident Evil titles, this wasn't as obvious to me.\n\nI may not be the fittest to write a review to this game. Reason is because I've played this and Resident Evil 5, and that's it. I know lots of people here have been around since RE4, and maybe even earlier than that! Eitherwho, this is my view of the game and I'm gonna explain what you should expect if you're interrested. I'm also gonna make some comparrisons towards RE5, and keep in mind that I've played through that game tens of hundrads of times(most damn literally) with the greatest of joy and I know how all of it's mechanics work. Somethin' else to keep in mind is that I'm more for the experience rather than nitpicking on some small details. ANYWAYS, LET'S GO!(I'll put a tl;dr at the end if you don't want to read this entire review)\n\nMODES\nThis game has several modes you can take on. Of course, there's the classical campaign, but it's divided into 4 different parts, each part is played by different characters. You can chose right of the bat which campaign to start with and which character to play, and durin' the gameplay, you will bump into the other campaign characters. How you play it and in which order is completely up to you. Somethin' else this game brings back is Mercenaries, the mode where endless hordes of zombies come and attack you, and your job is to fend em' off and gain points while keepin' the timer clockin'. There are more special modes such as Survivor, Onslaught and whatnot, but I haven't played those, mainly because they are DLC's that not many people own. Plus, I'm more of a solo guy, so that explains it.\n\nMECHANICS\nIf you've played Resident Evil 5, you will know what I'm talkin' aboot. The game is built around the combat techniques and loads of QTE's(which is a very bad thing for most, but not as much of a big deal for others, includin' me), and RE5 was no exception. To be exact, there were two buttons in RE5 specifically, one to "use" and pick up other objects, while the other one was for partner actions. Now these two buttons were used all the time as QTE's, where you had to press either one or both of them to survive. In this game however, they stepped it up quite a bit. By default, left mouse button does a simple melee attack, while right mouse button aims with the gun you're currently holdin'. Pressin' the left mouse button while aiming will then fire the gun. Space is used for sprint, as well as usin' some objects(jump over a gap, climb a ladder, etc. You will also perform these moves when already sprinting into em'). Regardin' QTE's, they are very situational and may cause severe rage inducing tendencies, so if you are easily affected by such, well, you were warned.\nThere is also skills you can purchase, both for the campaign, mercenaries and the other modes, which are purchased with skill points, which you can get in pick ups, as well as earned when completin' mercenaries games. Some of the skills increase melee damage, firearm damage, more frequent specific ammo pick ups etc.\n\nSomethin' more to keep in mind immediatly is that you can walk around while aiming, which you couldn't do in RE5(You actually stood entirely still when aiming). One more thin' I wanna mention is that you can manually perform dodges and rolls whenever you want. For instance, if you press space bar while aiming, you will perform a quick duck. If you hold A and press space bar while aiming, you will perform a left barrel roll. Same goes for W, S and D. These are also set to the keys Z, X and C, however you can press them whenever without the need to aim in order to roll left 'n right or throw yourself on your back to avoid an attack. Also, you can perform some epic counter attacks(known as coup de grace) if you press the left mouse button just as an enemy attacks. This also applies to many actions in the game, makin' this game very fun to play!\n\nPC RELATED SETTINGS(how good the port is)\nI'm no stranger to stuff like this, cus' I wanna play PC games on my gaming rig rather than console ports, and I wanna be clear when I say that this game is most certianly(and luckily) NOT a console port! There are enough graphical settings you can change(textures, refresh rate, vsync, resolution etc. Pretty much everythin' you'd need), and everythin' in this game regardin' the mouse and keyboard controls can be changed(however there's no secondary controls). You can also enable a gamepad(however you'll need to do some editing in some game files to get the Playstation button prompts, cus' normally you get buttons like 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. Other settings such as your preferred position(camera left or right to the player), laser sight or reticle, laser sight color, camera position, FOV(both default and when aiming) and lots of other goodies are available.\n\nPROS\n+Great remappable controls(you don't even need to use some of the controls, such as Z to roll left, since you can use the method I explained earlier)\n+Characters from earlier Resident Evil games are playable\n+Mercenaries mode(No Mercy mercenaries are also available with L4D2 characters)\n+great PC port!\n+Satisfying combat\n+Overall optimization+quality of textures are great, however some elements could be improved.\n+Plenty of campaign difficulties, includin' "No Hope" that was added because many argued that "Professional" wasn't dificult enough\n\nCONS\n-Situational QTE's which take some time gettin' used to(not to mention that some of em' are impossible to complete without dyin' by em' first)\n-A somewhat cheesy storyline+events(There are lots of parts of the story where somethin' happens that makes you go "How the hell did he do that?!" or "That's just impossible". A big action movie vibe if you ask me)\n-Playin' co-op will enable Steam's in-software microphone thingy, which has rather poor quality, not to mention a rather big delay(at least back when me and a friend played together, wahich was literally on day one when the game was out). This can fortunatly be disabled within Steam, so there's no need for tedious game file changin' to fix it\n-Somewhat lacking in gun customization, primarily because more focus in this subject went on to the skill system(more guns are found within the game, so no need to worry 'bout that)\n-There are lots of cutscenes, both short and long, that -could- ruin the immersion in gameplay\n\nNow, do I recommend this? I'm gonna say that I personally had loads of fun with this game! However, this is certianly not for everybody, and even the most dedicated of Resident Evil fans would dislike it. So wether I would recommend you to buy it or not is entirely up to you, but remember that the QTE's will haunt you...\n\n\n\nThanks for reading my review!\n~Melee-Chan","January 3, 2015","true","161.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The game itself feels like some sort of third person shooter fighting game combined with *A LOT* of quick action events. Some people have told me that in some parts of the game it feels like a third person version of Call of Duty, but I seriously couldn't play through the whole game (I had to force myself through the first 2 hours of gameplay).\n\nThe levels and the detail on the characters look pretty good, gameplay itself doesn't feel like a horror game and the controls on mouse and keyboard are terrible, if you really want to purchase this game make sure you do it during a sale and make sure to have a controller!\n\nIf you're new to the series and you really want to play this game, you might like the co-op mode which is probably the only good thing about this game but if you really want to play a 2-player coop RE game I suggest Resident Evil 5 which is far from the survival horror genre but it's a fun co-op game, one of the best ones I've played.\n\n\nTL;DR: Worst RE game ever, good action Co-Op game, get it during a sale.","January 15","false","2.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/judahjones/recommended/221040/","judahjones","Judah Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/judahjones/","121 products in account","I had many doubts going in. It was a complete ♥♥♥♥ show rating wise when it came out for consoles, and I made sure I avoided it. So when it popped in a steam sale recently, I thought what have I got to lose, and I have a PC that can handle it. And I'm very glad I did.\nThe positives first:  RE6 is  a good looking game. If your machine can handle it, crank up the graphics settings. Rain glistens off the characters as it falls, hair and clothes rustle in the breeze, and of particular note, the enemies are truly vile and horrifically disgusting, and I mean that a high complement. The spider-like enemies in particular always made me lean back from my monitor whenever they showed up, from their creepy scamper to the thick hairs growing off their bodies.\nThere's an over-arching story broken into 4 campaigns, with the occasional crossover with the other protagonists at certain points. The individual campaigns play very much like a greatest hits package of previous RE games styles. Leon’s campaign is like a retelling of RE4, from the cathedral setting down to the Ganado-like enemies. Chris's campaign is more like RE5, heavy on the action and broad daylight set pieces in a urban/military environments, and Jake's campaign is more like RE3 as him and Sherry are chased by the Nemesis equivalent UsterNakk (sp?). The last campaign of Ada Wong weaves its way through the previous 3 three explaining her presence in each, along with her own motivations. Each campaign has 5 chapters that take ~1 hour complete, so 5 one hour chapters per campaign x 4 campaigns is a pretty hefty 20hrs of action content. It’s all playable co-op too, and the AI holds its own. It also can't die, so you don't have to baby sit if you are playing solo (like I did). There’s certainly not a lack of things to take on. The story took lot of flack when it came out, but frankly, resident evils' plots have always been pretty ludicrous. At the end of the day, you are there primarily there to blow away zombies and all manner of disgusting bio-freaks, which the game serves up in droves. What probably threw people off is that the story doesn't unfold linearly and jumps all over the place as you complete each campaign. You can pick each campaign chapter and there are lists online of an order in which to play the chapters to get the story as is unfolds chronologically, but frankly i think that's unnecessary as it’s not that complex. It can suffer from pacing issues but you are thrown in some pretty large scale set pieces at least once per chapter so the slower parts are basically quiet before some zombie ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. Plenty of difficulty levels depending on the level of masochistic pleasure you desire. Overall, lots of replay value.\nOnce you learn the controls (an issue which I’ll touch upon later) You will realize they have made some much needed (and appreciated by me) changes to how the game plays. Characters are no longer tanks, turning laboriously left and right. There are standing dodges, back, forward and side rolls, and a first for me, laying prone is actually a useful and viable strategy (it recovers stamina very quickly). All the moves are very well animated too. Also, there is now a dedicated melee button, which is long overdue, and makes it easier when you run out of ammo and are surrounded. Its balanced by each melee attack consuming stamina, and when you use it all you have an exhaustion period during which you can't melee at all. The new additions truly shine in mercenaries mode, which arguably stole the show for me. The now standard score attack kill zombies for time mode is surprisingly addictive. the new melee and movement options really benefit the fast paced gameplay, and you will find yourself getting hype off of some John woo acrobatics that you engage in, pulling off a satisfying headshot, then physically countering an enemy trying to cheap shot you, and finishing them off  with a stylish quick shot. Very, very satisfying and just-one-more-round inducing (also I did them all solo, Co-op would be an even bigger blast as it does get hectic). Score an A rank or higher and you'll unlock a pretty funky alternate costume for that specific character, along with a remixed weapons loadout. Another benefit I didn't realize was that Capcom and valve did a PC exclusive left 4 dead 2 crossover with the characters of L4D2 appearing in mercenaries mode. Not only are the characters fully voiced, but their levels throw absolutely insane numbers of monsters at you at once. There are some multiplayer options, but these can easily be avoided, as the active online community is long dead and you can save a couple of bucks by not opting to purchase them with the rest of the game.\nOf course there is the other side of all this positivity. RE6's biggest issue is how poorly it conveys necessary information. The game tells you how to move and shoot, but that's about it. Nowhere, not even in an in game resource of some kind does it explain how to dodge, or other critical actions like quick shots and character specific quick shot combos. These is particularly baffling as several of the characters have character specific moves, like Jake's hand to hand combat and Leon/Helena's crowd control shooting maneuvers, which come in extremely handy. Fortunately there is an excellent ultimate survival guide on the steam forums which details all these things, but without that I doubt i would have stuck around for even a third of the game (which i'm sure many people didn't, which is a shame). Another valid complaint is that the default camera is much to close to the player. Makes for great screenshots, but also allows monsters to sneak up on you and get a cheap shot from behind in. The fix for this is adjusting a slider, but that option is obtusely buried in the game's title screen settings, Easily fixable, but again, i wouldn't know that unless I googled the issue. The last irritant i had was that the game suffers from the dreaded Bosses-that die-but-not-really syndrome. You fight and put down so mighty impressive creatures, only to quickly realize that you'll fight the same creature again in another similar 10 mins later, except slightly remixed (the second time in a confined space instead of an arena for example). It robs the encounters of any real weight, as you never feel like you accomplished anything, as they are back lickedy split minutes later with no sense of damage that they supposedly received.\nBut overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by how fun the game is. The campaigns chapters’ each have a how-can-they-top-the-last-encounter.feel, and you are guaranteed some sort of final epic boss encounter for each one. I would run through them again with a friend who was willing, but I'm glad I at least finished them each solo. The real draw will be mercenaries mode.\n","January 14, 2014","true","50.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

My initial assessment was that it seemed pretty good.  The gameplay quickly degrades however.  It seems like this game is trying to emulate games from the COD or Gears of War franchises.  This could be ok if it didn't seem like actual gameplay was an afterthought.  It's as if they designed these set pieces or scenarios and then thought about how to shovel in gameplay afterward.  The first realization of this was in the gun shop scene: WE ARE IN A GUN SHOP WHERE IS THE AMMO?!   I'd assume the owner wouldn't be so stingy because it's a zombie apocalypse, but perhaps I assume too much.\n\nOk, then aftewards Leon and Helena are on a bus where a big fat zombie is holding up the front tires so they can't get away.  They have to survive other zombies' attacks, while trying to emtpy enough rounds into the big one's head through the front window.  Zombies come into the bus, they melee them, they shoot the bus lifter, rinse, repeat.  It takes too long to get enough ammo to do this.  I'm ok with making a game challenging via ammo crunch, but this just breaks the tension and gets BORING.  Not to mention our big uberbadass Leon has a fatigue gauge where he can't kick a zombie if it runs out.  When we're surrounded by very dumb NPCs (who don't shoot the ranged spitter zombies) and trying to survive by doing super badass moves (more on that later) it was very frustrating to have this happen.  Game to player: give zombies running bulldogs and sweet roundhouse kicks!  Player:  Ok sure!! Game:  Oh wait we gotta be like all realistic and like the other big blockbuster games, so nm hobble around.  Oh also player, you can't keep like a shovel or 2 by 4 these guys try to attack you with to attack them back.. cuz like, we wanna kinda also be like old arcade games.  We'll just keep the worst of both worlds to make it frustrating.  Player: Damn this kind of sucks I hope the next encounter doesn't suck like this.\n\nSo that gets done and it gets to the cathedral.  This was like in Wolverine Origin when they get to the island.  The game is cruising along, not good, not bad, and then the wheels just fall right off.  First off, this church has security statues with laser guided crossbows.  I'm assuming it's some kind of facility b/c of what happened next... so why would they have an odd, inneffective security system of this style, instead of some kind of modern sentry turret, or ya know, a locked door.  So that part is also really dumb.  Then there's the boss fight where a zombie will pick up Leon and tentacle ♥♥♥♥ his face if you press buttons wrong.  This was the last straw for me.  I get that in games, especially horror games, your character will meet a grisly fate if you mess up.  The scene was just so gratuitously revolting.  It must have been included solely for a gross out, I guess.  Well I don't play games to be grossed out.  Again, shouldn't the gameplay be on the forefront of the designer's mind?  There was quickly a draught of ammo and melee did completely nothing to this boss while NPCs shot at nothing with their guns that apparently had infinite ammo.  Oh wait this boss also spews gas which turns people into zombies but Leon and Helena aren't affected, they can just stab each other in the heart with a syringe and then take herbs like mints and are fine.\n\nSo in a comparative summary:\n\nResident Evil 4 was 90 percent great and 10 percent manure (button mashing sequences and the block sliding puzzle should have been editted out on the re-release)\n\nResident Evil 5 is a little more on the manure side but that's still far outweighted by the good parts of game,  It has button mashing, but during one, the main character punches a boulder out of the way because he's just so damn jacked.\n\nResident Evil 6 starts off pretty good but quickly becomes a chore, but might appeal to those who value images of homesexual ♥♥♥♥ in a game over decent gameplay.","July 20, 2014","false","4.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Although complaining that this isn't survival horror is completely irrelevant as ever being done since RE4, there was NO survival horror labeled to this game. So why EXPECTING it. Calling it typical is very funny, there is no game like this out there, whatever they say. It has it's unique genre and way to display just like it's predecessors.  Innovation is when you make something different, not milk the same thing over and over. Resident Evil has for years always been a pleasure to play along, great characters just as the imagination for enemies. It keeps featuring more and more replayability every titles. For me, having to play the same style with a specific set of goals and predictable slow and barely harmful creatures is not my piece of favor. Having to remind of how they tried since REmake which IS after RE4 to create something that would be awesome to have in hands. This is the prime example, todays developper won't limit themselves to a static camera with simplistic controls. They'll go for what evolving calls, just like the players. Telling RE6 isn't scary is no excuses to call it bad, you got used to it and from my experience i did too. I'd rather have a series that became varied than be running around for the same puzzles everytimes i wanted to play it. Hell, even with REmake they had this features allowing to either create a vibe of freedom or a specific set of objectives, not forgetting to mention the very challenging hidden modes which NONE of the olders (Aside RE3) had before and there's RE6 right here coming with Mercs mode and much more with all of any possible thing to add so far. Either you pass or try to appreciate the unseen content of this quality sequel of a well known franchise for their bio-terrorist context. You don't remain scared forever by zombies, just like the characters themselves.","June 30, 2014","true","30.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

However, controlling the characters with the keyboard, could be a mess...Use a gamepad/joystick for Windows. Exactly what you expect from Resident Evil , I must say that I love this game. I love the addition of four stories instead of the usual one story with three difficulties. Like RE5, there is a co-op option, which I do take advantage of, since AI's are useless in every way aside from healing you. There is more to try to achieve with this game, unlike the others. You can track your unlocked files, achievements and game progress. Each campaign has an interlocked story, but they each have different overall skill usage. Leon's campaign is more defense, since you can stay safe in most all boss battles by just keeping distance of rolling on the ground. Jake's campaign is more melee, since there are parts of the game that you can only use Sherry's stun rod and Jake's hands to fight, they also don't give you a lot of ammo in this campaign. Chris is more firearm attacks, since they give you enemy after enemy that can't be taken down easily and they give you enough bullets that you'll have to shoot to make noise to keep room in your inventory. Ada's is mainly puzzles and quick thinking, since a few parts of the game are a race against time, and if you so much as run into a wall for too long of a second, you die. This was an excellent addition to the game, so it doesn't feel like the chapters and campaigns all run together. All over, this was a very great purchase. The game is a clean and easy install with no patches required for full function. The graphics are amazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/221040/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","So, what can I say about this game? It's a modern Resident Evil title. It took a few good things from Revelations 1, one nice thing from the old titles and a lot of bad stuff from a lot of other Resi titles. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\nIf you want to skip the lengthy part of my review, you can find the pros and cons list below.\n\nFirst things first: the story.\nThe story is a bit bigger this time around. For one thing, it's because of the fact that it features five campaigns. On the other hand it's because this time the story centers around the fate of the world - AGAIN! Well. But it doesn't feel as insignificant as Revelations 1 since you'll be fighting against a lot of ♥♥♥♥ in the USA, China, Edonia and other places. An organization by the name of Neo Umbrella has risen and is terrorizing the world with... well... bioterrorism. Like in all the other games. But the game looks better than its predessecors. So that's a plus. Anyway. The main character cast centers around Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Sherry Birkin, Ada Wong along with their respective sidekicks. Also there's Albert Wesker's son but I won't spoiler anything. These people are trying to save the day by defeating Neo Umbrella. That's more or less the gist of it.\n\nFans of the old games will be pleased to hear that you'll be fighting classic zombies from time to time. When you first start the game with Leon you'll be watching limping half-corpses around a city in the USA and when you're in China you'll be seeing them there, too. On enemy variety the devs were pretty creative again. But nothing too new tbh. You got the classic zombies, you got the J'avo. The J'avo are somewhat like the Majini and Ganados, only more extreme and instead of a parasite there's a virus responsible for their mutations. The J'avo have some surprises up their sleeve when it comes to mutations so that's not all too bad. These are the main enemy types. But the bosses are where it's really at. Remember El Gignte? You'll be fighting a couple of those in this game (not like the farce of an El Gigante in RE 5). Then there's a bunch of hulking creatures of plates and muscle with are ♥♥♥♥ing annyoing to defeat because they're bullet sponges. And some other boss battles with a giant, invisible snake, crazy people who thought injecting a dose of the virus into themselves was a good idea (didn't see THAT one coming *chuckles*) and some other ♥♥♥♥ I don't wanna spoiler.\n\nBut wherever there's an enemy, there oughtta be a weapon to defeat it, right? Yes! Weapons wise there's a lot. In every campaign you'll be getting different weapons and every character you play as has a different set of starting weapons to begin with. Over the course of each campaign you'll acquire new weapons and you will find a lot of uses for each of them. And yes, there's an elephant killer magnum gun again. But as always, it's ♥♥♥♥ing hard to find any ammo for this thing so hear my advice and use it in boss battles or if absolutely nessecary. Like when you'll be fighting against those chainsaw ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (that are EVEN harder to kill this time around). Aside from that there's a bunch of stationary weapons and some are one time use only.\nBut the best part about this is: in theory you don't even need weapons most of the time because they finally improved the melee combat. meaning that you can now punch and kick your way through  hordes of enemies. Given that they don't shoot you down. Warning: not recommended on harder difficulties because it's generally a dumb idea to only do melee fighting in any Resi game. Well, usually if you have to do that you're bsaically screwed and might as well start over. In this one you can deal considerable damage to your enemies with melee combat. Which is a plus. Also the animation set for melee combat is quite nice to look at.\n\nOn the technical side of things the game runs fine on highest setting, no FPS drops, no crashes. Only one time it didn't recognize my save file but that problem was quickly sorted out so fear not, you won't have any technical issues with this one. At least I didn't have any.\nGame mechanics wise there's a lot of stuff I didn't like and some stuff I was really fond of. As I mentioned earlier, there's half-decent melee combat now, which is a plus. Then you may move while aiming and shooting. First Resi game that brought that one to us was Revelations 1, I believe. Which is a great plus. They finally noticed just how useful this feature is. Knife fighting is no more, you instead screw 'em with your guns in melee combat. Also a good idea. What else? Well, you can walk, run, shoot, hit, die, survive, climb, jump down (a lot of these actions may require you to stand at specific positions however. Resi style) and, when playing with Ada, use your grappling hook.\nOh and there's skills now. Like, you collect skill points and after each chapter or so you can buy and upgrade skills with them. The idea's nice but ultimately useless as I didn't use them all that often. Only scenario where I could imagine them being useful would be on the really high difficulties that aren't even fun anymore.\nAlso the partner mechanic is back but it isn't annyoing anymore. Now enemies target your partner too (not like RER) and you almost never have to worry about them dying (unlike RE5).\nAside from that it's standard 3rd Person Shooter. Oh, but wait!\nThey are back. More gloriously than ever before. They Q to the T to the E. QTE sections en masse with this game. I mean, I can understand it having a few QTEs in the game. But in Resi 6 they are pretty much used excessively. Not as bad as most of the reception is putting it but it's not like they had any QTEs left after this one. There are a lot of scenes where you just have to smash a few buttons to come forward and avoid death. At least some of the QTEs are creative in the sense that they require you to click at a specific time. But yeah, they're still QTEs.\n\nWhat else?\nI got a few gripes with this game QTE wise, yeah. But the worst part is that the credits are unskippable. That wouldn't be so bad if:\nThe credits weren't so long because a trillion people worked on this game and\nyou wouldn't have to watch them five times.\nWhy five times? Well, there are five campaigns and after completing each campaign you are required to watch those unskippable, long-♥♥♥ credits.\n\nAnd the final piece of information will be the subtle humour in the game which is most prevalent in Jake's campaign because Jake is just the badass guy who doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about most of it and just does his thing along with his audible drek. It's funny, really. Mostly anyway.\n\nSo, to wrap this up, pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n+ Improved graphics\n+ The story isn't too bad (and feels WAY more significant than RER's)\n+ Most of the mechanics in the game are improved\n+ Different animation sets for a lot of enemies (not unlike some OTHER games. Yeah RE5, I'm lookin' at you)\n+ Oldschool zombie slashing action in the first few hours of the game bringing back good memories\n+ Awesome death scenes. Seriously, to die in this game can look pretty cool. There's even an achievement for that\n+ Fairly good melee combat and gunplay\n+ Ludicrous bosses that are even more crazy than before (I like that stuff)\n+ Good enemy variety\n+ NO QTEs IN CUTSCENES\n+ Replayability because you can choose between two characters playing a campaign and each of them is a different approach\n+ And more\n\nCons!\n- A thousand QTEs\n- Unskippable credits\n- Linear gameplay and story (as always)\n- Horror? Lol, no\n- Boring "puzzles"\n- You'll die frequently because of some QTEs\n- I got nothing more honestly\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yeah, it's good for what it does.\nAt 20 bucks?

There's everything to love and nothing to hate. If we consider the last trilogy, Resident Evil from 4 to 6 this is easily the best of them all, the culmination of the action Capcom offers. You can do all sort of new moves which are awesome, you can slide, dodge, land on your back and shoot from the ground (which can be done when enemies drop you too), you can fight in melee with combos or switching to a melee weapon. I really like the fluidity of the game and it's even more fun with a friend. The coop of this game is great, you are not helpless per sé, you can counter enemies' grapples, you can even "stand up" for yourself if you survive long enough in a down state, but, of course, it's a lot easier if there's a team mate helping you out but that may not be always possible due to tactics gone wrong or levels where you have to stay apart for some time.\nThere is much to explore, some campaigns have more exploration than others, graphics are really good for my standards (which may be low since I don't really care) and it goes at 60 fps even if the benchmark told me it would go at 20-30. The campaigns are a great idea, different enemies, different characters, different playstyles and it's a hard game too! I play at Professional difficulty, invested 23 hours in the game right now and I'm something as halfway through (I'm doing chapter 3 with Chris now after doing 3 chapters with Jake and Leon). I really can't find anything wrong with this game, it gives me the challenge I seek, the adrenaline, the fear (the fear of dying but there are some jumps too), the gameplay is perfect as I see it, this was much more than I anticipated, I'll definitely play this multiple times.","March 27, 2013","true","84.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The focus is really heavy on getting quick kills with powerful melee finishers and the counter insta kill mechanic is a huge plus (something similar to Jill's counter evasions in 3 but more obvious).\n\nIf you find that the game isn't survival'esq enough go with no hope difficulty, if you're just starting the series then go with Veteran or Professional. There's no need to play normal or easy.\n\nThe story of 6 is told through 4 viewpoints; Leon+Helena, Chris+Piers, Sherry+Jake and Ada. Each one overlaps with another at some point in time and those outcomes will switch to force the characters your playing as to play the major role.\n\nWhile the single player can be fun I think the major focus here is in the multiplayer, I've never been too big on playing mercenaries other than to just unlock stuff but with the new mechanics it really grabs your focus. All the other "competitive" style multi modes are all DLCs and it's a hit or miss if you buy them, although I hear survivors is the most played (DM/TDM).\n\nIf you just remember that you're playing an action game, it's pretty good. Don't have high expectations of this being a puzzle heavy surv horror and you can appreciate what it is.","July 11, 2013","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an intense game, where you can play as Leon, Helena, Chris, Piers, Jake, or Sherry. The three main campaigns (Leon, Chris, Jake), link up as they progress.

My favorite was when one of the monsters gets run over by a school bus. There's four separate intertwined campaigns that take over 20 hours to finish the first time. The game is highly replayable.

The optimization in this game is amazing, It runs smooth and looks great, definately a step up from the Xbox 360 version. Although this game is very different then the previous installments in the series, it is definately an improvement in many categories, although the game did inherit the use of explosions similar to a Michael Bay film, and begin to ditch survival horror for action it still remains a fun and interesting game that any fan of the resident evil series should try.  For any newcomers to the series this game is great too, it is easy to pickup at times and at other times a bit difficult. I recommend when playing this game to try it on a more challenging difficulty, the game is too easy on lower difficulties and really challenging on the max difficulty. You will enjoy it.\n\nThe real improvement is that you can now walk and shoot and roll around like a mad man, it's amazing, a resident evil game where you are now limber and agile.\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

RE series (Resident Evil) has been evolving & moving further away from its survival-horror roots and more so into action-game territory with each entry - and in many people's opinions, this has been ringing more & more true with every entry since RE4. Regardless of what you may think of the changes in direction, there's one question still lingering: as a game, whatever it may be, is RE6 actually any good?\n\nTo answer the above question, one must also ask this: what does one actually want out a Resident Evil game? Do you want that Resident Evil 4 & 5 level of awesome action-packed gameplay and style? Leon's campaign certainly delivers this - and I think is the best overall campaign in the game; especially in the gameplay department. Leon's campaign is nothing short of awesome. Are you looking for an action-packed shooter-game w/ that "bro-feel" w/ lots of soldiers (that are AI) often surrounding you and often comes across feeling like Call of Duty and Gears of War games often does? RE6 has that - and it has its own twist on that, since you do have Resident Evil elements (i.e. Inventory and can combine items); well, Chris Redfield's campaign delivers this.\n\nWhat else would you like in a Resident Evil game? Do you want a more hand-to-hand & melee-based, more-acrobatic, more stealthy experience, and some driving element with some of the well-known Resident Evil elements? Jake's campaign certainly delivers this. Would you like a more single-player style campaign (if you play it w/out another player) that has similar elements to Jake's campaign, but also actually has some puzzle elements like other survival-horror games do? Ada's campaign delivers this. Not only that, but Ada's campaign has the actual best story in the game - delivering more elements of story-telling; big twists and reveals; and filling-in many of the gaps that were left lingering from the other 3 stories.\n\nDo you like all of these types of games? Then, certainly, this game's definitely for you. Then, the "sums of its parts" factor will certainly speak to you, as it delivers all of these gameplay experience and does them all very well. Because each campaign often feels so different and so focused on different gameplay elements and styles - RE6, in a sense, often feels like 4 different Resident Evil games rolled into one entire ridiculously huge package.\n\nAll of these campaigns, they can be played with Co-Op, if you like. All of these options can be set, when you load-up a saved game or start-up a brand new game. Each character has a partner with them, where the partner can be played by the game's AI (for all you offline and/or solo gamers) or even be played by another player online (for all you Co-Op gamers). Ada's campaign is the exception - as that is a solo-campaign by herself and without an AI partner if played solo (as it was originally built) - but it can be a Co-Op experience if you want to play online with a partner.\n(SIDE NOTE: The option to make Ada's campaign an additional Co-Op experience was added later by the dev's). In an interesting twist on things - when playing online, gamers can play a monster in certain parts of the game and invade other player's actual game at certain times.\n\nOne of the best & worst things this game has going for it and against it is its overlapping story & intersecting elements. You might run through an area again entirely that you did in another campaign - and it might not be much different; or you might do a different actual one part of the map in one campaign, but then a different part of the map - and it feels totally different, until they intersect somewhere, if they actually intersect. Chris's campaign does the same exact certain boss fight a few times (which is overly repetitive); and then we run into this same exact boss fight with Jake. The problem here is - you pretty much play this same boss fight the same exact way every time, whether you're doing Jake's campaign or Chris's campaign.\n\nNow in another campaign, you might do the same boss fight - but you're doing it as a different character with a different element and role to it, making it another kind of awesome. For example - in Leon's campaign, you do a boss fight on the ground like you normally would in a typical action game and shoot it on-foot, even though other characters are there and have a different role; while in Ada's campaign, you do this boss fight totally in a helicopter, shooting the enemy & firing missiles. You can always skip cut-scenes, which is a plus, if you don't want to see the same cut-scenes when any of the overlapping of the 4 stories take place. It's unfortunate that if you did a boss-fight on one campaign already, there's no option just can't skip that same boss-fight in another campaign - especially if the roles for the characters aren't too much different and you don't want to go through the repetition. It's when your character has a completely different role and element entirely, that you actually will really want to do the boss fight.\n\nThe graphics in this game are pretty good, for the most part. While the character models and especially the monsters are all excellent-looking, all loaded with detail galore and plenty of excellent art direction; it's the in-game textures for the objects in-game areas that can be of low-quality, when up-close. While game-areas and environments its art direction often do look great, it's the details within them that can vary. Thankfully, RE6 is not in a case like a Bioshock game would be in - where the signs, posters, and anything that's on them is important and need to be seen and read at its best quality, all so you can gather more detail and information about the game's story, lore, and get immersed in its game-world.\n\nMost of the story-telling is told via cut-scenes and while playing in-game - and there certainly is plenty of this. While each story itself on its own is actually good - it's b/c of the overlapping of its stories, which makes this great. A lot of things that may not add-up entirely in one campaign, this can only be realized only from playing a different campaign entirely. Ada's campaign ties together a lot of the story elements, filling in most of the gaps and blanks that might've been lingering and left-over from the other 3 campaigns. Once a chapter is unlocked and finished, gamers can jump to any Chapter and even replay them. You are graded for how you perform in each campaign - so fans of this game and perfectionists might want to replay the game and certain chapters just for those reasons alone. If that isn't enough, the game has an experience system where players can upgrade specific skills for each character and actually roll all of that into New-Game+ Mode.\n\nAfter 33 hours of gameplay and taking on its 4 different campaigns - where two of them are at least good and try something different for a RE game (Jake's campaign & Chris's campaign); one campaign is absolutely an fantastic campaign especially for its gameplay (Leon's campaign); and one campaign that is a stand-out just for telling the best story of the bunch and giving us the most clarity (Ada's campaign) - this game is an absolute flawed-gem of an action game. If it wasn't for some of the repetitive boss-fights & certain areas that couldn't be skipped when tackling another campaign (b/c you feel like you've done some of this before), this game would be absolute masterpiece. The "sum of its parts" factor in many ways are often what makes this game as great as it is - but in a few other ways, that also can be one of its few minor flaws. Resident Evil 6 is experimental, ambitious, grand, epic, and ridiculously huge in scope - and because of this, it might not always deliver the best Resident Evil experience, but it most of the time will deliver such an experience.\n\nFinal Grade = B","October 25, 2013","true","34.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It was very hard for me to hit the recommend button for this game, and there are basically only three reasons why I am recommending it.\n\n1: It does offer a lot of content. This has four normal sized campaigns, even if some of them have a couple of interlapping scenes, it will offer you plenty of hours of playing.\n\n2: With a good co-op friend this game can be extremely fun. People give these modern RE's a hard time because of the less survival horror, or the fact that they are co-op, but I think co-op is actually one of the series biggests strenghts now. In a world with very few co-op games, this game is a fun time if you have some good friends to play it with. I highly recommend playing on the higher difficulties.\n\n3: It's the Resident Evil universe. It's more of an already cool universe with enjoyable monsters and enjoyable characters. Yeah it's not perfect but it's still more RE.\n\nNow what do I not like about this game? The controls take awhile to get used to, I don't know why, but they just feel more awkward than even the older titles. I think pair that with the extremely tight corridors in some of the campaigns and it just makes it feel extremely sloppy.\n\nWhile the stories aren't bad, I felt there wasn't a good protagonist on the level of Wesker. I did like Chris's target for the first half, but although there was build up it did not end the way you would expect.\n\nLeon's story I felt had the most boring / easy monsters, as well as the least inspired easy boss fights. I feel like Chris's campaign was just better over all.\n\nThen you have some minor nit-picks on things that they took steps backwards from RE5. No DirectX10 support, no LAN support, and over all I'd say RE5 even looked better. The share system for swapping items is gone, and unless someone tells you picking the setting as the host doesn't actually change the other persons difficulty setting.\n\nI think what disappointed me the most is that RE5 was basically a better game in every way. The only thing RE6 had going for it was length, but length is not important when RE5 just has more replay value. I think because I enjoyed RE5 so much more as a co-op game I will always just feel RE6 was one of the biggest let downs in the series. Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed it enough to recommend it, but barely.","February 1, 2015","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The focus is really heavy on getting quick kills with powerful melee finishers and the counter insta kill mechanic is a huge plus (something similar to Jill's counter evasions in 3 but more obvious).\n\nIf you find that the game isn't survival'esq enough go with no hope difficulty, if you're just starting the series then go with Veteran or Professional. There's no need to play normal or easy.\n\nThe story of 6 is told through 4 viewpoints; Leon+Helena, Chris+Piers, Sherry+Jake and Ada. Each one overlaps with another at some point in time and those outcomes will switch to force the characters your playing as to play the major role.\n\nWhile the single player can be fun I think the major focus here is in the multiplayer, I've never been too big on playing mercenaries other than to just unlock stuff but with the new mechanics it really grabs your focus. All the other "competitive" style multi modes are all DLCs and it's a hit or miss if you buy them, although I hear survivors is the most played (DM/TDM).\n\nIf you just remember that you're playing an action game, it's pretty good.

Yeah honestly game evolves from puzzle soving type of genre into a shooter game and later into an action one where u roll, do counterattacks and so on. Although it's a really big change overall, I found this game really enjoyable, if you are thinking about buying it, it is worth it the try, you can always refund anyway, but I don't think there will be a reason for doing so. The only thing you should consider is that it is a next shooter, not the original RE game, many old gamers tend to stop playing RE games just because of that, so, if u are the veteran RE type person, there is a chance that u won't like this game, although I liked this change and I love the game, that decision will be up to you. And shortly to the story, you've got 3 main campaign, including famous character such as Leon S. Kennedy or Chris Redfield, + one smaller campaign including Ada Wong. I like the plot and everything around it as always, and the thing that they actually met in the game is just briliant for me, I love it all the way. So yeah this game for me is 8-8.5/10, just because it's again a new genre which developers have jumped into, although I recomend this game, everybody who loves RE should play this, no matter if the person prefers Shooter game or the puzzle game.","January 10","true","75.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first time I played RE6 I thought, wow, this game feels allot different then the other RE games, like the combat, camera angles, and story telling; Even though the game is different from the rest, that doesn't mean that the game is better; Change is not always a good thing.\n\nCombat: The devs wanted to make a game that was more fast pace, and more appealing to new players in RE6; But by doing that they took away so much of what made the games so great. Resident Evil 6 feels more like an action game then a survival game now. one of the reasons the other games are so great is because of the combat system, you really had to think about what you were doing, and you conserve lots of ammo, and strategize allot, about where to shoot them, and what zombies to kill. But in RE6 the combat is way to easy, you can go in, run and gun with no consequence's at all.\n\nCamera Angles: I can safely say that, the camera angles in RE6...SUCK! The angles of the camera is centered on the screen, and the guy is way too close to the screen; It is really heard to see around the guy. The only time you can really see good is if you ADS then the camera will center over the guys soldier, like the other resident evil games.\n\nStory Telling: In past games there were one story in the game, but in RE6 there are 4 story's! And all the story's feel like they were half ♥♥♥'d. The only good campaign was Leon's Story, all the other stories had some cool sequences, but with out any spoilers, Leon's Campaign had the most going for it.\n\nThe Verdic: I did enjoy playing Leon's campaign but all the other campaigns felt extremely half ♥♥♥'d. The camera angles were extremely annoying in places, and the combat was way too fast paced. The only game mode that is really good with the combat system is the Mercenaries, especially the No Mercy Mercenaries.\n\nWell I just gave you my honest opinion about the game.\nI hope this review helpes you decide.\n\nThis is Death Wish Signing off.","April 9, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well that is utter tripe. It is a logical continuation of the RE  franchise.Sure it isn't classic Survival Horror but that has been done countless times in the series and things need to move on.\n\nI for one would not want another game stuck with the frankly horrid and awkward controls we have been saddled with since RE:1. People do not rotate on the spot, neither are they incabable of walking and shooting and it's about time that convention died a sad and lonely death.\n\nThis is a good game and has plenty of old and new characters meeting across intersecting story lines. So far I have played Ada's campaign and had a blast. There are plenty of secrets to find, icky things to shoot and the odd classic `makes zero sense` puzzle thrown in.\n\nThere is a ton of Co-op, Versus and Online action to be had across the various DLC packs and plenty of replay value.\n\nThat is the pros out of the way, sadly there are a few cons you should be aware of:\n\nThere are more Quicktime events than in the Tomb Raider reboot and that is really saying something. I personally HATE QTE's and just wish programmers would sod off putting them in games already. My percentage scores for Ada's campaign is tragically low due to the amount of times I died because I failed yet another QTE mini `game`. Games are fun, QTE mini games are not.\n\nI can handle dying because I played like an eejit and ran out of Ammo or walked into an obvious Ambush but failing to waggle the joystick, press X at a specific time then hit RT in the right order at the right speed is annoying beyond beleif.\n\nThe Controls are way better than previous iterations and being able to run and shoot is a godsend. However  there are ALOT of contextual actions and sometimes things go a bit wonky and you end up running into an enemy rather than actually pulling off some awesome takedown.\n\nOther than those negatives this is definitely worth your time and money if you have any love for the RE series in particular or action games in General.","February 5","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The optimization in this game is amazing, It runs smooth and looks great, definately a step up from the Xbox 360 version. Although this game is very different then the previous installments in the series, it is definately an improvement in many categories, although the game did inherit the use of explosions similar to a Michael Bay film, and begin to ditch survival horror for action it still remains a fun and interesting game that any fan of the resident evil series should try.  For any newcomers to the series this game is great too, it is easy to pickup at times and at other times a bit difficult. I recommend when playing this game to try it on a more challenging difficulty, the game is too easy on lower difficulties and really challenging on the max difficulty. You will enjoy it.\n\nThe real improvement is that you can now walk and shoot and roll around like a mad man, it's amazing, a resident evil game where you are now limber and agile.\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It just feels off somehow, like they run a bit too fast or something, really hard to explain. REVELATIONS 2 is running the same engine and pretty much same controls but feels much more refined and tighter. If you play both side-by-side maybe you'll see where I'm getting at. I never really noticed this when I first beat the game on XBOX 360 but now it's really starting to bug me. Surely it's not just me.\n\nAnyways, I think the game is good, not the best RE title by any stretch but it's still an enjoyable COOP game. The story is ridiculous and forgettable and RE:5 and RE:6 is now so far removed from RESIDENT EVIL that we really should be calling them something different now.

The most noticable features is the multiple character selection and different campaign routes. Below will be a list of pro's and con's that I've summarized from my experience with this game.\n\nProz:\n1. Chargin' strike! Melee isn't just standing on the spot and doing a slash that is literally face to face.\n2. Execution from melee combo! This was from RE4 but was somehow removed from RE5 so I'm really glad it's here!\n3. Characters. Each character has their style of attacking so have fun exploring them all!\n4. Serpent emblems are bigger, and more easily spotted throughout the campaign.\n5. Vehicles isn't just limited to cars anymore.\n6. Dodging buttons. Many others say this feature is useless but I think it's kinda useful for doing side rolls through vents.\n\nCons:\n1. No more weapon upgrade feature or portable gatling guns :(\n2. Herbs are incredibly rare after Chapter 1 of any campaign.\n3. Camera angle in certain zones. Experienced RE players will know the struggle.\n4. Online community is pretty much dead. Either that or there'll be some rushing jokers with a lifespan of 6 seconds speeding through the game.\n5. Inventory is a joke. I understand that for story's sake, each character will not have a shared bank system like RE5 but this is the main contributing reason why I'm stopping every now and then because I have to choose between herbs or ammunition. If Christ can stuff an entire grenade launcher AND a sniper rifle in his pocket, why can't he do the same for the rest??!?\n6. 8 skill slots and only 3 skills for each. You can only select one slot at a time. I strongly don't see why anyone would need up to 8 slots.\n\nOverall rating from me would be 7/10. It's a good game that you won't regret. Long hours of gameplay and the unexpected QTE's are the "fun" features of the game.","May 29","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the most enjoyable experience, play on veteran or professional.\n\n\nI don't really understand why this game gets sh** on so much. I've been a fan of the Resident evil series since its inception, and have had to grit my teeth along with the rest of the fans through the movies and games like Raccoon City. Resident evil 6 may be flawed, but the PC version is a true successor to RE5, let me explain.\n\nMany people's main complaints about RE6 are either the bad AI, the muddy graphics, or that it is a poor console port. Anyone who has played RE5 recently will recall just how bad the AI was in that game. Playing single player would mean that you would have to call Sheva 5 or 6 times to get her to help you open doors or do objectives. Sheva would constantly get knocked down or held in place, and she would knock you down with her attack reaction. The zombie AI in 5 was also pretty terrible, where J'avo would climb up things and then immediately jump off in order to attack you, or they would get stuck inside each other because they wouldn't understand where to go. In RE6, I feel like I never have to worry about my AI partner, and the enemy AI always keeps me on my toes(on Professional difficulty) with their new running leaps and ground grabs, and the large numbers of regular zombies make them feel actually threatening.\n\nThough the graphics/ textures may be muddy at times even on the highest settings, the shaders and effects are great. and the underwater effects in Ada's campaign may be some of the best I've ever seen in a video game. That being said, there's not much of a graphical change from consoles to the PC version. Whats also important to realize though, is that Capcom has tried very hard to rectify their mistakes from the console versions, and has added tons of new options that will help tweak the game play to your preferences.\n\nThe story is in a similar vain to the RE5 story, where it's mostly action, losts of Quick-time, and some exploration. This time around, there are 4 campaigns, and though they may be shorter than RE5's full campaign, they keep the action varied and prevent it from becoming stale. Unfortunately, the action-oriented nature of the campaign seems to confuse some players, as if they forgot how much action/Quick-time that RE5 brought to the table.\n\nThe difficulty this time around has really increased. I vividly remember RE5's Professional difficulty being somewhat of a pushover, with zombie's movements and attacks being perfectly telegraphed and predictable. This time, Professional mode really increases the survival horror feel, as being grabbed or missing a dodge can spell death for your character. As I mentioned before, zombies have new attacks like running jumps and crawling grabs, and the special zombies can ruin your day quite easily.\n\nAll and all, the game is the next evolution of the RE series, which in my opinion is a great installment (we should be thankful they didn't continue to go the Raccoon City route). The new crossover instances and Agent attack modes can be fun, and are great ideas that I hope they continue with in the next installment.\n\n9/10","March 24, 2013","true","94.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A popular name in movies and games... This game gave me both a fright, a rush and a serious headache...\n(this is the first RE game i've played, but I did look into the earlier releases)\n\nThe gist:\n\nPros  - Fun, refreshing combat (at times)\n- Very interesting story arc\n- 4 different perspectives on the campaign to play through, each with 2 characters to choose from\n- Big variety of enemies and weapons (surprisingly)\n- A very decent port to PC from console\n\nCons - A port from console to PC\n- Stereotypical Japanese intensity and overreacting character personalities...\n- It is either really easy, or frustratingly unfair\n- Annoying as f**k cinematics and animations\n- Really stupid design choices\n- Did not come with contact details of the developers, so I can punch them all in their faces\n\nThe big one:\n\nThe biggest and most glaring issue with this game are the forced in-game cinematics you HAVE to watch every time your partner opens a path way (that I can clearly see is opening), or calls a switch to my attention or ties his shoe...\n\nMany many times these cinematics led to my death because the enemies continue to attack you while you stand there watching the camera show you the inside of a tunnel for 30 seconds...\n\n\n\nThe explanation:\n\nThe design choices really irk me badly. From the attempted phone/PDA style menu that does not pause the game to the entire idea of releasing the RE series for consoles primarily is something I don't understand. Though having a game like this on console seems like the better choice it really isn’t.\n\nI say this because the combat focuses heavily on the player to precisely hit limbs or the head of an enemy if you want to be ammo effective on harder difficulty settings. I tried playing with the Xbox controller for PC, but I always felt out of control and slow.\n\nThere are a lot of bad choices ranging from map design to camera angles but In all honesty, those bad choices are not stopping me from playing through the entire game... Because it is interesting and fun.\n\n\nI can't tell you whether this is a better RE than the previous ones but what I can say, is that it is fun, cheap and a bulky amount of story to uncover and take part in...\n","November 27, 2014","true","34.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I am about 12 hours into RE6 and havn't finished it yet***\n\nI skipped RE6 when it came out because of how crushingly disappointed I was with RE5. After seeing the review scores, I pretty much figured I knew exactly the kind of terrible the game would be.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago, it pops up on the Steam sale for $10, I pulled the trigger just to suffer through the game to see how batshit crazy the story has gotten. What I actually got was one of the most refreshingly playable Japanese-style shooters since Vanquish and Binary Domain. Let's put all the hub-bub aside, as a game with no strings attached; this game has great, tight mechanics and gives you a variety of tough enemies to dispose of.\n\n\nI think this game is a victim of awkward pacing and unrealistic fan expectations.\n\nThe pacing is much better and the story flows much more naturally when you play the first couple chapters of Chris and Jake's campaigns before starting Leon's. IMO the game should have just been one long campaign to better control the pacing of it.\n\nAs for unrealistic fan expectations, I honestly think a big chunk of the people complaining either never played RE2/RE3/RE:CV, or they just love those games too much and have trouble seeing that those games were criticized for the same things back in the day. A lot of the complaints about RE6 can be made about the classic Resident Evil games.\n\n- Campy/Ridiculous/over-the-top story\n- Bad voice acting\n- Not very scary, cheap jump-scares\n- Non-conventional controller layout\n- Too action-oriented (read some complaints about RE2/RE3/RE4)\n\nThere are plenty other complaints that are totally valid. Too many QTEs, too linear, not enough puzzles (early on in the game), almost no exploring of environments, so on. It's far from a perfect game, but I do think it's a very fun game, and I havn't even touched Mercenaries yet.\n\nIf you decide to get this game, a few tips:\n- Increase the FOV for god's sake! Standard FOV is unplayable IMO. 15/10/10 is perfect.\n- Play the game in the suggested campaign order found in various forums\n- Play on a difficulty higher than normal to actually give yourself a challenge, make you fear enemies and make ammo more coveted\n- Have fun with the campiness of it all!

Characters and story arcs that entice you to love and hate characters. Blooming unlikely love story. Unexpected partnership based on mutual trust. Unresolved and mysterious love interest. PTSD hero, who loses more than he wanted, and gains much more only to lose some. Deceit and disillusionment. And twisted unrequited EVIL love.\n\nIt is action, zombies, guns and knives, grenades and gritty puzzles. Not only do you use your skill, but also your brain, something most zombie games don't have. What is truly terrifying is the fact that the 'zombies' are not mindless killing machines (for the most part) but are capable of organisation.\n\nDownside is the ANNOYING camera angles, that though you could get used to after a while, certain campaigns force camera angles that keep changing and warping into almost unworkable conditions that result in your death. QTEs are a pain sometimes but are exciting - thought it depends on you. An overusage of it - in my opinion - but there is an option to turn them off, so that's good. (I'm looking at you Chris/Piers)\n\nBottom line a product worth its blood and gore. There's a million ways to die and so satisfying when finished - not only cos of the action element, but also the story element. Graphics ain't half bad either, and is plenty reliable as compared to other franchises that are trying to up their game.

So, I think - if you are a conservative person who love ONLY old games of RE(with puzzels, difficulties and less of ammo), that's not a game for you.

I am about 12 hours into RE6 and havn't finished it yet***\n\nI skipped RE6 when it came out because of how crushingly disappointed I was with RE5. After seeing the review scores, I pretty much figured I knew exactly the kind of terrible the game would be.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago, it pops up on the Steam sale for $10, I pulled the trigger just to suffer through the game to see how batshit crazy the story has gotten. What I actually got was one of the most refreshingly playable Japanese-style shooters since Vanquish and Binary Domain. Let's put all the hub-bub aside, as a game with no strings attached; this game has great, tight mechanics and gives you a variety of tough enemies to dispose of.\n\n\nI think this game is a victim of awkward pacing and unrealistic fan expectations.\n\nThe pacing is much better and the story flows much more naturally when you play the first couple chapters of Chris and Jake's campaigns before starting Leon's. IMO the game should have just been one long campaign to better control the pacing of it.\n\nAs for unrealistic fan expectations, I honestly think a big chunk of the people complaining either never played RE2/RE3/RE:CV, or they just love those games too much and have trouble seeing that those games were criticized for the same things back in the day. A lot of the complaints about RE6 can be made about the classic Resident Evil games.\n\n- Campy/Ridiculous/over-the-top story\n- Bad voice acting\n- Not very scary, cheap jump-scares\n- Non-conventional controller layout\n- Too action-oriented (read some complaints about RE2/RE3/RE4)\n\nThere are plenty other complaints that are totally valid. Too many QTEs, too linear, not enough puzzles (early on in the game), almost no exploring of environments, so on. It's far from a perfect game, but I do think it's a very fun game, and I havn't even touched Mercenaries yet.\n\nIf you decide to get this game, a few tips:\n- Increase the FOV for god's sake! Standard FOV is unplayable IMO. 15/10/10 is perfect.\n- Play the game in the suggested campaign order found in various forums\n- Play on a difficulty higher than normal to actually give yourself a challenge, make you fear enemies and make ammo more coveted\n- Have fun with the campiness of it all! Stop taking RE so seriously!\n","December 29, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wudichao/recommended/221040/","wudichao","谭松韵seven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wudichao/","514 products in account","The good stuff:\n\n--- The game offers not one but four campaigns! This is pretty cool considering the 4 couples you have which means 8 characters - each with a different personality, extra attack or weapon and importance when it comes to the storyline. Also, enemies approaching you differ in each campaign. The same goes to the locales. While Leon and Helena traverse through the big city, a cemetery and a cathedral offing dozens of zombies Chris and Piers do the same but in China. They are attacked by J'avos - these are infected people with the ability to plan their attacks and can also use firearms.\n\n--- Graphics / cutscenes / sound effects -> production value. Well, after episode 5 it was obvious the creators would take this to another level. The game looks stunning and the atmosphere is there. The coop and action sequences once again decrease the horror elements but nobody can say they did not try! Also, there are dozens of cutscenes and in the game's menu you can rewatch all. Altogether I'm sure it will take at least 2 hours to go these in one sitting.\n\n--- Longevity. Once again we have collectibles that come in the form of emblems. I have found many but could not find a lot either. There are no more treasures as collectibles. Instead, there is something else that is dropped by the enemies and they represents points. This amount can be used to purchase skills. These can then be levelled up. 3 skills can be active at a time and there are enemy-specific ones, too. So, you and your coop partner need to work together and decide who equips what. Multiplayer also returns in the form of Mercenaries and there is now a new game mode called Agent Hunt.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\n--- 4 campaigns: In terms of story and characters this is really good but there are too many intersections. In fact, there are boss battles you need to play twice. Really? Of all this it is Ada's (4th) campaign that is the worst. First of all, almost all the areas are familiar and you encounter hardly any new enemies. Throughout all the campaign you know what's going to happen and the ending is a total letdown. Not only this but Ada plays alone. Your friend assumes the role of a so-called Agent - a guy who's just there so that the creators can tell they did really make a coop game. Agent wears a mask and does not have a real name. In the cutscenes you see Ada alone and throughout the campaign Agent cannot interact with anything. You cannot open doors or chests, you cannot solve any puzzles and no QTEs for you (which is actually good). You can pick up bullets, of course and fight with Ada but feel like an unnecessary character who does not even have a story.\n\n--- Cheesiness: If you thought episodes 5's dialogue was bad you are in for a great surprise. Some of the conversations the protagonists have are just dumb. In fact, you can easily guess what will happen next. The script should have been reworked at least 3 times to eliminate some of the worst dialogues this franchise has ever seen.\n\n--- Boss battles: They are waaaaaaaay toooooooooo loooooooooooooong! You battle the same guy while he assumes at least 3 different forms one after the other. The tactic is different as well as the environment. It is not necessarily a problem but the game is very difficult and also you are 100% sure you eliminated your foe when he returns once more to annoy you. I have to admit the enemies are great (each one of them poses a real threat) but you battle them for too long. This gets boring and aggravating considering the difficulty of the game.\n\n--- Difficulty level: This game is annoyingly difficult. From time to time you get a QTE which is next to impossible to complete for the first time. Missing it will result in a death cutscene - well, I appreciate the developers wanted to show me what cutscenes they had conjured up in their mind but this is still pretty annoying. Boss battles can be a pain and the controls do not help either. It is a sad thing to say since this game enables you to do pretty much everything: you can run, do fistfight, dodge and even slide. And finally: you can walk while aiming at an enemy! The problem is with the turning and the speed. Also, the camera does not help and sometimes you get attacked because our heroes are looking at what's going on elsewhere in the distance.","December 28, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been playing Resident Evil since the first one on the PS1 and I think 6 is a great game. Just because it's different from the first ones, it gets crap reviews. The series evolved, get over it. People complain about the QTE's. Why, though? Is your timing horrible that it makes you lose? You think instant deaths are "unfair and stupid"? Resident Evil 4 had QTE's and people loved that game. Enemy grabs you? You get a chance to make a comeback with a QTE. Enemy about to make a lethal attack? Time it just right, and you can turn the tides. It adds depth, it not just "get hit and that's it" you have a system that awards your fast reflexes. I can understand why people wouldn't like QTE's in say.. cutscenes, but many games do this as well, it's not just RE6. I didn't mind them, keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe story line is crazy, yeah. I enjoyed it, I don't know why people QQ'd over it. Three intersecting story lines? Common, that was great how that played out. Cheesy dialogue? Yeah, every RE has it, nothing different, right? I don't see the big deal.\n\nAnd even after the story is over, you get to play the amazing mini game, Mercenaries. Gotta keep that combo up! The pressure of needing to keep killing is awesome. Combat system is great, I really feel like this is the most underrated thing in RE6. On PC, shooting the undead is really satisfying. You get great mobility and evade tactics. You have to strategize to get a higher score and a higher combo. Utilizing items that the map gives you, meleeing enemies to gain time. Mercenaries alone is worth it even if you think the main game is garbage (which like I said, I don't think is the case).\n\nGreat game Capcom, I loved it and you have a satisified fan eagerly waiting the next Resident Evil.","February 12, 2014","true","174.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unlike classic franchise releases game does not posses option to save on the go. Combat system, controls and camera behaviour within the game are fairly easy to get used to.

That's a half-hearted yes. I wish Steam used stars instead of a simple thumbs up or down. If you're a fan of the series and you like the characters that have grown on you over the last decade or so, then yes, RE6 is a good play.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're really just casually into the series from a distance or haven't really been following all the games to this point, I'd say, just go ahead and watch the full videos on YouTube to get the gist and skip this purchase.\n\nThe Good:  A lot of people really hated on this game in strong ways, and the criticism has some validation. But let's start with the good.\n\nGraphics - A nice improvement from previous RE games, though at times the lighting makes it hard to tell as such. There's several different campaings to go through in this game, each one has some pretty nice visuals and character design.\n\nGameplay - This is both in the good category, and the bad category. The good part of the gameplay is in the improved combat structure. Overall all the control scheme plays a lot more like a normal 3rd person shooter, making it easier to aim and shoot on the fly. Veterans of other games should pick up the controls fairly intuitively, and I'm glad to say that ditching the old tank-style controls from previous fames feels like quite the improvement.\n\nCharacters - We've got some old favorites coming back for long time fans, and some new characters in the form of Helena, Piers, and Jake. Helena is paired up with long time vet of the series, Leon Kennedy, and Jake Muller is paired up with Sherry Birkin, now in a starring role. Chris and Piers have an interesting dynamic as Chris has fallen into a rut, so Piers is almost the spitting image of who Chris was back in RE 1. No matter who you play as, the characters flesh out pretty much the same, but it is entertaining to see how some of the characters have either matured or fallen into disgrace, (like Chris).\n\nStory - This is another category that's both good and bad. The good part of the story is that there's actually 4 whole campaigns to work through, almost like 4 entire resident evil games. Each one takes on an archetype: Leon's is dark and tense, Chris' is very action themed, Jake's is mostly a chase sequence, and Ada's has a lot of the classic puzzle solving and intrigue.\n\nThe Bad\nGameplay - Man, despite all the new 3rd person changes, there are some very head banging moments due to unnecessary Quick Time Events (QTE) and bad camera angles. I died more times to stupid button pushes and a poorly rotated camera than I did to any creature in the game. Jake and Sherry's chapter was the worst offender.\n\nStory -  Oh man, where do I begin? It's fun to have 4 different interweaving tales, but the downside is that you really get to a point that you just want the game to GET TO THE POINT. You have to do several boss fights several times on several characters, which can feel very repetitive. But my main issue with the story is that I didn't feel that any of the characters really found any major progression, with the exception of newcomer duo Jake and Sherry. At the end of the game, Leon is still Leon, Ada is still a mystery woman, and Chris is reset back to where he was at the end of RE5. Nothing new gained. Jake/Sherry, Piers, and Helena change, but nothing new with returning cast members.\n\nCharacters - The villains in this game needed a lot of work. A LOT. The enemy types are fantastic: tons of work went into making the J'avo and zombies in this game different and creepy from other games. The bosses and lead villains however, have very little in the way of explanations for why they are doing what they are doing it. This is pretty typical for Resident Evil in general, but I really felt the bite of it in this game. You'll find out who the mastermind is of a plot and basically shrug your shoulders and say, "but do I care?" Instead of villain development, you may just have to fight that same boss 3, 4, or 5 times, which in no way substitutes character development. At some point, players want a payoff for their hard work: they want questions answered, they want to see what makes the characters tick. Don't expect that here.\n\nThe Ugly\nCheapness - Yep, I'm calling shenanigans. I'm a big fan of the Dead Space series, which has a few cheap tricks in the form of jump scares or regenerating bad guys that ♥♥♥♥ you off sometimes. RE6 had this in every campaign. So let me define cheap: despite your ability to annhilate waves of undead and using your nearly omnipotent hand-eye coordination, you fall victim to a boss mechanic you didn't know existed. Or, you fail to rotate the left stick fast enough, since you weren't expecting a QTE. Or, you do exactly what you were supposed to do, but the camera flips on you so instead of it being behind you, it's now in front of you and you have to change what you are doing. Yeah... cheapness.\n\nAnd let's not forget my favorite: the 'protected by the plot' enemy. You're walking down a hallway full of corpses you know will probably come alive. You aim carefully for a headshot and squeeze a bullet off, which passes harmlessly through the body as if it was ethereal. Once you get close enough though, it comes after you, and now you're in a bullet spraying/melee frenzy. I find that extremely cheap.\n\nGun Inefficiency -  I don't know what happened to firearms between RE5 and RE6, but bad guys just don't take bullets like they used to. Aiming at a hand or foot in RE4 or 5 and popping off a shot, even with your first pistol, resulted in a body lurch from the bad guy that resonated a satisfying impact from your bullet hitting their body. None of that in RE 6. I might as well have been shooting water pistols instead of a figgin' magnum. One thing I love about Dead Space as a series is that each weapon has some serious weight to it. None of the weaponry in RE6 feel like they pack a punch, with the possible exception being the grenade launchers, and even those don't have nearly the splash damage and impact you'd like. This game tries to add in more of a melee component, where you either stun a guy with bullets and then finish with a melee strike, or vice versa. To say I hated it would be an understatement. What the hell are firearms good for if I should just be slugging my way through the apocalypse with my dukes?! Even with every boost you can get for your firearm skills, expect them to feel woefully under-powered, especially during Leon and Helena's campaign. Even when you get a shotgun in that campaign you're wondering why you bothered with it.\n\n\nRidiculousness -  A tank chasing you through a building? Check. A sudden avalanche chasing you down a mountain while you race down it with a snow mobile... while the ground erupts earthquake style under your feet? Check. Literally, this list goes on and on. Resident Evil has always had it's moments (Zombie SHARKS?! = RE 1) but this game took it to a new extreme. There's actually a lot of good moments in this game where the action is feeling tense, but then it's broken with yet another ridiculous chase sequence, or button spamming QTE, or monster that won't die from bullets, because, REASONS.\n\nIn conclusion: Some of the game can be pretty fun, (more than I was expecting, still frustrating at times), but there was definitely some ideas that didn't pan out in this game. Too much genre mash-up, too many QTE's. The game does have some good visuals and atmosphere at times, but if you're looking a pure survival horror experience, you'll probably want to pick up Dead Space 1, 2, or 3. If you're a fan of Resident Evil/BioHazard and want to check in with some of your old favorite characters, by all means, pick up this game, but be ready for some shenanigans.","April 6","true","34.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For those who played in the first part on the PlayStation, Resident Evil - is patiently waiting until the zombies get into firing range of your shotgun, it's interesting puzzles, this is totally authentic feeling of fear, when a huge biological weapons runs you around the dark and narrow corridor. Very decent representative of the series. Well knotted plot, fully revealed only after a full course for all the characters. Variety of bosses, weapons and locales the same can not but rejoice. Interesting mix of gameplay, there is a grain of good old classic RE and what is from what we've seen, and new developments. Not that funny, it's really a series of steady movement towards action. Horor genre from almost nothing left, and I think not everyone wants to go through all four of the plot in order to learn the essence of the action... Anyway got much better than last RE5.","July 1, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Namely, splitscreen. On. The. P. C.\nMerc Mode has never been funner, and Agent Hunt mode is a fantastic twist on L4D's versus mode, which instead drops human-controlled zombies into the single-player campaign, making it feel all the more disconnected and intense (also no vote kicking for giving pills to your buddies or being knocked down even once) due to the lack of communication with the other team (in addition to no racist remarks every time you kill or get killed).\nCross-over co-op between campaigns is also a brilliant idea when it works, I just wish it was more natural somehow. I wouldn't recommend getting RE6 for full price, but if it's on sale, consider giving it a shot.","June 29, 2014","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

RE6 may not be what all of us want from a RE game but it's co-op is actually quite enjoyable (other than Leon's final boss fight)! Further more, while some have complain about the seperate storylines, I thought it was kind of neat how each flowed together. It reminded me of the older Resident Evils like 1 and 2. In conclusion, If you're looking for a fun co-op game to play with a friend, this is for you. If you're looking for survival horror... I guess you'll have to wait and see what RE7 has in store for us.","July 11, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The reality is just different than that in each person respectively. Resident Evil 6 is a mess, yes, but an awesome mess. It's not like any previous Resident Evil games, it has been changed in many ways, in my opinion, are better from time to time. Good combat system, enhanced co-op mode, great storyline and good free online service ResidentEvil.net are definitely worth its price. As a long-time fan, I rate this game at 8.5/10, -1.5 for ugly graphic details in some scenes - which are not serious, and some fatal bugs at release day (yes, they're fixed, of course).\n\nHint: There's a clue about next installment of Resident Evil franchise at the end of the game, see it by yourself.","March 31, 2013","true","96.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Old and new characters are thrown into the mix, which pleases some and frustrates others. For example, some people are die-hard Chris/Leon fans yet others are getting a bit tired of the franchise having so much focus on them.\n\nRegardless - Despite it obviously cashing in on the success of RE4's action roots, RE6 is still a solid shooter - Just not a solid Resident Evil. The gameplay is fun and RE6 sports an absolutely gargantuan bestiary to fight head on, whether solo or with a partner in Co-Op.\n\nThe story is completely brainless and gone are the cheesy lines and hammy acting - Instead, it's basically a case of just blitzing through a mediocre story with whatever character combo you like across their (total of 4) campaigns, all trying to blend together to tell the overall non-existant story.\n\nSounds pretty negative so far - Yet here I am, clocking up countless hours thanks to the immensely fun Mercenaries - No Mercy mode, having been a Mercenaries fan since RE3 and a sub-game fan since RE2. Having grabbed the game for 15 euro, it's hard to say it wasn't worth it - Afterall, I've been playing that sub-content more than I have some other higher priced 'main' titles - Allowing me the enjoy RE6's strength as a 'shooter' and enjoy the tension of trying to score 300 kill combos while being hunted down by a city full of impressive beasties.\n\nI thoroughly recommend action/shooter fans to give RE6 a legitimate chance, yet die-hard Resi fans of the 'older' generation of RE (and aren't too interested in the shooter-style of RE4/RE5) would likely be better off avoiding it and waiting for the upcoming RE7, which Capcom promises will 'get back to the basics / roots'.\n\nIn short:\n-Too far away from older Resi's, alienating older fans.\n-Entirely shooter orientated with no scares and little tensions.\n-Quite QTE reliant during story-mode.\n\n+Good to boot up for the sake of 'fisting a zombie in the mouth' with your favourite Resi Character.\n+Agent Hunt & Mercenaries is a lot of fun if you have good company to play with.\n+Good to look at, decent acting, good sound and one or two memorable music tracks.\n\nJust an all-round 'OK' game that would have done SO much better if it was not put under the Resident Evil name.","June 8, 2014","true","464.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Its definitely departed far from its survival horror roots, its much more of a 3rd person action game at this point with a robust combat system that is much more melee and dodge involved. There is a large selection of weapons that you just pick up as you go and ammo is never an issue it seems like, I actually ran into instances where I had to throw some away to make room in my inventory. Its an enjoyable action game though, as long as you have someone to play it with, I would not recommend doing most of the game yourself (although the partner AI is much better than it was in 5). There are several campaigns to go through and extra modes, like mercenaries, so you actually get quite a bit of content in this one. Theres also a bonus mercenaries mode for this pc release where you can play as Left 4 Dead 2 characters and special infected from that game show up, its a neat little addition that changes things up. I'll give it a solid recommendation, just don't expect it to be a survival horror game.","July 22, 2014","true","37.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theeon/recommended/221040/","Theeon","Yakuza Girl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theeon/","205 products in account","Biohazard 6 is a difficult game to class. On the one hand, it does so many things right, and on the other, some things horribly wrong.\n\nThe story is split into 4 campaigns, each with their own gameplay and style; Leon S. Kennedy and Helena Harper team up to take on a traditional zombie outbreak, Chris Redfield and Piers Nevans have an all-out war on terror, Jake Muller and Sherry Burkin battle near-invincible bosses, and Ada Wong solves both gameplay and plot puzzles. Leon and Helena's campaign is the best, with a great atmosphere and fun gameplay involving traditional zombies, with Ada's campaign 2nd for it's plot and puzzle elements. Jake and Sherry have the most unique gameplay, due to Jake's Melee ability complimenting Sherry's ranged ability, with QTEs holding it back from being the better. Chris and Piers share the worst of the four, with their campaign being about as cliche and boring as your average military bromance story. They do crossover, both in terms of style, gameplay and story, and they do all contribute to an overarching story, which is convoluted but interesting enough that it held my attention from beginning to end.\n\nGameplay is were the game really shines and shows it's unique identity. Movement and combat is a smooth, fast and fluid ride for the most part, broken up by the bane of my existence: Quick Time Events. With gameplay as good as it is, I'm simply lost to find any reason why they thought filling their game with these boring, tiresome interactive cinematics. The excellent combat mechanics, which include dodges, rolls, cover and some character specific moves, are more than enough to carry the game. The other stuff on offer, however, is not. Some driving sequences from Chris and Jake's campaigns are more painful than fun, Ada's helicoper level is mostly boring point and click, and some other odd choices make some sections of the campaign more trouble than it's worth. Multiplayer also handles an odd mix; while the basic combat mechanics are great in modes such as Mercenaries, Mercenaries No Hope, Versus and the other modes that handle normal characters play well, others, such as Agent Hunt, which puts you in the role of a zombie in the campaign, controls awful and feels sluggish. Also, don't bother with the gamepad. It works, but barely, and the keyboard has hotkeys which will make your gameplay experience so much better.\n\nThe music and audio is all around high quality, with excellent voice acting, great music and fantastic audio cues enhance the gameplay and the story to awesome hieghts. It played exceptionally well on my 5.1 Surround Sound system and was a thrill to blast the sound to it's maximum levels.\n\nGraphics are all around great. The HUD is small and keeps out of the way for the most part, but the itmes menu could have been handled better. The textures are decent aside from some low-res environmental textures, and the lighting is beautiful. Animations, Capcoms strongest point, I think, is fantastic, though some feel like they're too exagerated and overlong. The art design holds up well and is overall a great-looking game.\n\nStory - 7/10\nGameplay - 6/10\nAudio - 9/10\nGraphics - 8/10\nControls - 8/10\n\nTotal - 38/50\n\nThe game ran in max graphics, minus the Anti-Aliasing, at 60fps, with the following specs:\n\nWindows 7 64bit\nIntel i5 750 2.6GHz\nNvidia 250GT 1GB\n4 GB RAM\n1920x1200 Monitor","December 3, 2013","true","237.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

All the campigns are intertwined with each other, showing each pair's journey through the main storyline. There is a LOT of gameplay here if you want to experience it all. Each campaign seems to play differently as well. It's a pretty great setup. Leon's campaign reminded me of Resident Evil 2, while Jake's campaign reminded me of Resident Evil 5.\n\nThis game feels janky and unpolished a lot of the time. The dialogue is lacking and unimpressive. The graphics are mediocre, primarily from low texture quality and repetitive use of objects, textures and the like. Elements in many levels just feel all the same, with just the geometry changing. Some areas look visually impressive, but it's rare and short-lived. The controls and camera are ridiculous at times, but that's always how the Resident Evil franchise has been. Luckily, there are a lot of custom deaths when you fail quick time events, and they never get old.\n\nThe level of quality varies GREATLY throughout the game... the beginning of Leon's campaign is just awful, stereotypical, and poorly executed. It gets better later on, though. Jake's campaign felt more consistent and solid, while also being less over-the-top.\n\nDespite all the bad, the game is actually fun COOPERATIVELY. I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you're by yourself, since relying on the AI is not fun, and you can share the ridiculousness of the game with a friend. It's like watching a bad movie and making fun of it... it ends up being fun. I highly prefer Resident Evil 5, as it's better in every single way, but if you're looking for another Resident Evil game, there's a lot of content here.","January 1, 2014","true","30.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Words like, "Umbrella", "Zombie", "T-Virus", "Jill Sandwich", and "Wesker." Then the game watched every one of the RE movies, back to back - everyday, for a week. And then wrote a "script" from four different points of view. None of these individual stories make any sense on their own, yet once you've beaten the game(s) and dealt with their UNIQUE playstyles (see: Unfocused, Confused, and Sexually Curious), the story somehow makes 100% LESS sense than when you first had no idea what was going on.\nWhile growing up, this game took the whole "Buddy System" concept entirely too seriously, and decided to tattoo the phrase across its chest when it turned 18. It was also raised to be severely narrowminded concerning all Eastern European/Slavic peoples. It was brought up to believe that, "They're a bunch of dirty, war-mongering, genocidal, tracksuit-wearing, subhuman, walking garbage cans, who only cause trouble and kill each other. Plus they're actually monsters."\nAnyway, the amount of action scenes, and scripted, "GO! RUN! STRUGGLE! JUMP! HELP YOUR ***PARTNER*** AND ACT LIKE YOU CARE!" content makes the whole RE "film" series feel like Terms of Enrampagement - No, sorry, I meant Terms of Endearment. I feel a little uncomfortable at the moment, so, in conlusion - Imagine a slippy, slidey, third person Serious Sam game with an almost, possibly, nearly functional, "cover-system," with the narrative tone of The Road, acting equal to that of a six and a half year old Cambodian immigrant, and the rollicking sense of humor of a wet cinderblock with a dead cat on top.","July 5, 2014","false","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This would've been fun if it weren't for all the incessant quick time events and chase sequences. The problem is probably with the port, the game is clearly made to be played with a controller. Trying to run with a keyboard during a chase will drive you insane, especially with all the ridiculous fixed camera changes. Seriously, I'm still trying to finish Chris's campaign, that last chase is absurd! And without checkpoints!\n\nQuick time events were the main cause of my deaths. Which is a shame, because when you're going around killing zombies or whatever it get's pretty fun. But before you know it, you're thrust into one those obligatory race, underwater(really?), chase sequences, quick button smashing that all games seem to have nowadays and then everything goes to hell.\n\nThe combat gameplay is good, it feels great to be able to take down a zombie with your hands. Every character feels different, the dodging mechanic works (once you get the hang of it) and the weapons, while not the best, definitely doesn't detract from the game.\n\nThe story is... fine. Your usual bag of cliches. Although it succeeds in creating a frenetic apocalyptic atmosphere.The characters are great for the most part (though I wish there was a bit more of race and gender diversity). It was nice seeing Leon and Sherry again. But can someone explain to me why the hell does Leon have feelings for Ada? They were together for like, 2 hours, in RE2! Ugh! All his scenes where they mentioned this were groan worthy.\n\nThe atmosphere is really where the game succeeds  Especially in Chris and Jake's campaign, the set pieces looked great, from Europe to China, they all had a distinctive feel. Unfortunately, the first half of Leon's was really out of pace. They tried to bring the survival horror aspect back, but it doesn't work anymore, not with the frantic combat style of the game.\n\nOverall I'm disappointed. This game could have been great, but it fails in its execution.","June 29, 2014","false","32.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Fun, exciting & sometimes terrifying.\n\nRE6 add's 2 story mode's with 4 characters. Gamemodes such as onslaught and merc's. Online ranking & full controller support both xlive & direct input's. Split screen mode allowing you to play with a friend or family. Options & settings are great, story mode is fun & multiplayer is even more fun. Steam also seems to give L4D characters in the merc's gamemode switching the zombies and specials into L4D zombies and specials. Overall, game is well made & worth getting on steam.\n\nOverall rating: 9.5\nGraphics: 10\nSound: 8\nGameplay: 8.5\nFun factor: 8.5","February 8, 2014","true","66.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

However, there's very little action. The game's pacing is absolutely funereal. You'll shuffle through boring exploration sections, unskippable cutscenes, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ QTE and awkward action. In nearly 1 and a half hours, I barely shot anything. Does Capcom not know how little people care for the stories and characters in its games? They just keep plodding through. I jumped in expecting some fun zombie shooting action - noooo, I had to slog my way through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level looking for a character, then looking for a door, then looking for a keycard, then looking for a reason to keep playing this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nAs for shooting, the controls are awkward as hell. The game's idea of 'survival horror' is stiffing you on ammo. The interface is cluttered and hard to maneuver, they waste time with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ exposition instead of a proper tutorial to walk you through the controls, and did I mention how slow it was?

Grappling with the overwhelming sense of the infection; still having to fight off zombies, operate various mechanisms, and try to protect your partner while the world goes black around you, and you can only briefly see glimmers of footfalls. A burst of light as a barrel is knocked over nearby!! Seeing a zombie decapitaded by a trap, and then have to blindly make your way past that trap, just hoping you're somehow clear of it and never being sure at all! It was really exciting, and one of the best gameplay experiences that I can honestly remember having!\n\n\n\n\n. . . .hmm? Oh, ahm, was that all, just a glitch in the game? Because it was happening a lot, and I thought it was, uhmm, maybe intentionally? Oh, er, the game's just really glitchy? Oh. Yeah, it did freeze up a few times too, and, I guess I was pretending that I had fully become a zombie at that point. . .well, if anyone wants to make a game where the player experiences what a zombie sense, and provides the zombie player with a gameplay experience of how a zombie actually behaves, then this is really the game that shows what's that like!! I don't care if it glitches, I really had a lot of fun with it!\n\n\nIt is really, really glitchy, though.","December 8, 2013","true","14.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Why did I say No to this game? Because I don't want Capcom to make the same mistake again.\n\nThe game contains 4 campaign, one of which is captivating. I played Leon’s campaign repetitively, like an actual insane person. I can’t say that it has any major issues, expect the game’s general issues, which the entire game has. I know the dialogue is a little more than cheesy, and you won’t really want to listen to the character’s talk, but the rest is fine. The game (I’m speaking exclusively No Hope difficulty, the hardest mode of the game) doesn’t give you much ammo, which makes it much MUCH more survivor than Resident Evil 5, and you’ll have to do a lot of headshots combined with the following melee attack in order to get through chapters. Of course, sometimes it get pretty annoying when killing an enemy is mandatory, you’ve used your bullets judiciously, but the game is refusing to give you bullets and instead keeps showering you with skill points.\nThis campaign is dark and nostalgic. I actually lived through it. I missed Raccoon city so much; I missed the atmosphere of Resident Evil 3, and this game came so close, which I’m grateful for. Thank you, Capcom.\nThe bosses, as always, are needy pathetic characters you can’t grow a liking or respect for (which doesn’t count for a flaw.)\nChris’s campaign is where the bugs and issues come to life for the first time, but the campaign still feels like an actual game. Here, you will see enemies actually shooting “through” each other. While you can’t possibly shoot an enemy through another enemy (the first enemy is blocking the other one), enemies can do this. Their bullets fly right through each other and reach you.\nIt has ridiculous artificial intelligence. When you’re hiding behind a wall and an enemy is using a machine gun from 100 feet away to kill you, the enemy will aim at you even when you’re moving behind the wall. HOW CAN THE ENEMY SEE WHERE I’M MOVING FROM BEHIND THE WALL?\nThere are these round and explosive enemies who will explode when you get close to them or kick them. Piers, your partner for this session, keeps kicking them all the while, regardless of where you’re standing. If I had a cent for every time Piers killed me, I’d have a dollar.\nThen there are the headshots, which is a very crucial thing in the No Hope difficulty of the game. When you do a headshot, then enemy starts crying and pressing the wound, giving you a chance to perform a lethal melee attack. But the thing is, if you do 1000 more headshots, the enemy won’t show reaction again until he’s done crying, meaning you won’t be able to get the enemy to react again until it’s done with his first reaction. Now that’s just a big flaw.\nOh, the Camera, the Camera. Do I even want to tell you about the camera? The heroes are constantly looking around, and the camera follows their looks. When they’re done sightseeing, you’re usually attacked instantly, which is hideously annoying in No Hope difficulty, where you can actually die because of that. Sometimes a bus is following you, and you have to dash in order to escape. The character is looking at his front, but the camera only shows his back, which results in you being blocked by some crate or something, and then dying. In Chris’s campaign, luckily, there isn’t much to block your way. But in Leon’s campaign, you can be sure to die at least once.\nThere are these cut scenes that you can’t skip, which will annoy you to death for two reasons. One, the enemy has the ability to move during these scene, but you’re not. And when the cut scene is finished, the enemy will attack you instantaneously, giving you null chance of defending yourself.\n\nNow, please pay attention that I got an S (the highest score possible) on every chapter of this game without cheating or using tactics that count as cheating. So I’m not annoyed because I don’t know how to play or anything. The game is seriously flawed.\n\nOne time, a truck ran over my partner Helena in chapter one, and she died. I’m only made responsible for my own character in this game. Why the hell does my partner die like that at times?\n\nI don’t have much more to say about Chris’s campaign. I should add that it’s STILL worth playing. Once you get used to the bugs and flaws, you’ll really like this game. It has beautiful bosses. If you know what I mean by beautiful. Really fun to kill.\n\nDon’t even play the third and fourth campaign. I continuously felt like I’m waiting for the game to begin. The chapters were either too short or too long. And they didn’t feel like games, they felt like prologues.\n\nSpeaking of prologues, the prologue of the game is most boring thing ever. Helena is dying and you have to save her. The more boring thing is that you have to play that part of the game for a second and third time (as Leon, and then as Ada).\n\nThe story was beautiful. This is the only Resident Evil game with an actual storyline, with character development. It’s no longer about saving a certain somebody and escaping a certain town (which happened for five games), this one actually contain some drama. You may even cry. :D Don’t say I didn’t tell ya’. ;)\n\nVerdict:\nDo not buy this game if you’re not a Resident Evil fanatic, because you’d only be supporting a failure. You’d be rooting for another game of this type.\nThere is much more I can say to dissuade you from buying this game, but I’m not gonna. This is becoming longer than I had expected.\n\n","April 2, 2015","false","207.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Leon's starts out really good, a real return to form. then it gets real stupid about the time "Debora" shows up.  Chris's campaign is basically gears of war. (i enjoy it for what it is, but it is not very resident evil = ish)      Jake and Sherry are the best and worst parts of the previous two campaigns mashed together, and Ada (campaign 4) feels like an afterthought, but feels a lot like RE4 )\n\nThe campaigns are pretty long,  and your first time through will generally take 4-5 hours for a single campaign. unfortunately they far outstay their welcome in the form of final boss fights that end up being half an hour long, and are full of quick time events.\n\n\nthe controls are the best in the series, but it still has issues. the biggest being they decided to bind the key to sprint (and you'll do a lot of it), use levers and open doors, interact with objects (and you'll d a lot of it) , duck and take cover behind objects, AND quick time events all for the same single keybind.\n\ndefault aim is an ugly crosshair but you can use a red targeting laser reticle. my favorite way to aim. turn it on in options menu.\n\ni recommend binding this action key to your middle mouse button because it is probably the button you'll click more than any other while playing through the entire game. it needs to be comfortable and easy to find. default i think is "f" which is a horrible idea.\n\nthe controls are pretty complicated but very satisfying once you get the hang of it (it'll take a while) .\nyou can dodge in 4 directions, and continue to shoot while you lie on the floor and/or roll around to safety. some characters have their own knife, but everyone kicks and punches the same regardless of the weapon you're holding so just like in Mercenaries, shoot, stun, and melee to death is the way to go.\n\noverall the new controls are  pretty cool, and a great idea. i think this is a step in the right direction to evolve the series as far as controls go.  brushing up against surfaces allow you to "lock" into place, letting you peak around corners and shoot safely (like every other third person shooter) and the camera is pretty good about letting you do it. sometimes you'll go into a psuedo first person view because of the lack of camera space, but they executed this well.\n\nunfortunately the camera is also your enemy . devs made a bad decision to randomly force the camera to auto focus on your objective about..half the time. this can often prevent you from even attacking the nearest threat because you can't turn around and see what's going on behind you.     there's also a nasty bug (at least i hope its a bug) in Chris and Pier's campaign where the camera can't even be moved and I can't aim or shoot. only run toward whatever the camera's pointing at.\n\nproduction value for this game is really high quality (probably where most of the budget went).  if the dialogue wasn't so cheesy, i might actually get a little scared.\n\nunfortunately this is not a scary game, nor does it feel survival-ish.       your inventory is essentially reduced to a handful of guns and grenades, and healing.    there's nothing in this game you pick up that isn't ammunition, a grenade, or an herb and you can carry every weapon at once. the only real restriction is how much ammo you can carry (and half the time, you have too much. puzzle items fuse with your pathfinder\n\nthey stream-lined the entire inventory into a small scroll-fest that pops up during play. (there's no pausing, your inventory accessed is all real time, so be careful).     this is about the only thing that actually adds tention and fear for the better. i think this is an idea worth carrying over for the future of the series, but i want a real inventory management, and clues /items to carry around.  hard choices that have to be made.     in this game, there are none.  all super linear levels, some minor deviation for exploration (for items, but remember, its only ammo and currency you find)\n\nmultiplayer community is dead (no surprise, with the massive pay wall) so don't expect to find random matches more than once in a blue moon.     so much lost potential. the multi player is quite fun and has great longevity design but since you can't find players, there's no point in recommending these good fun game modes since they require human players.\n\n\nthe co-op functionality in this game is impressive. it's a shame though that it was pretty much designed around having 2 human players at all times, because it isn't as fun playing alone.  your a-i partner cannot die so they will be your personal medic and tank you can completely ignore without consequence.    this isn't a bad thing as you are first playing through the game, as you learn how this friggin game works, but it really shines when you can feel the cooperation with another human.\n\naside from being able to jump in and out of any of the 4 campaigns at any time with any player, there's also a pretty cool "Agent" mode where you join solo or co-op games as an enemy soley with the purpose of killing those players and making them restart whatever they're trying to do.  it works well and adds some depth of fear knowing you have one or multiple humans who are always tracking you, trying to make you fail.\n\n\nmy two massive cons which cannot be ignored, however, will really hurt your overall experience.\n\nthis game is only difficult in the sense that it throws cheap instant kills and annoying quick time events at you CONSTANTLY.          I hate these things. I don't know anyone who actually likes them.  This game is full of them.  Typical action sequences where you are doing just fine and suddenly the game says  "press r + left mouse button NOW" or you die , and restart.\n\nThe second con is a mixed bag. At least once in every campaign (and sometimes two or three times) you are immediately thrown into a fixed camera angle (like the old games) but you have to literally sprint in one direction at full speed to outrun various dangers.    if your key binds aren't comfortable and fluid, this is a major pain in the ♥♥♥. Just about every scenario has the camera looking at what's chasing you so you can't see where you are going, you just trust the game and run "forward" and "away" from whatever's chasing you. blindly.     thankfully you can pretty much use one button (that stupid action/sprint/quick time/and everything else button) the entire time. just hold it down and be prepared for more quick time bull ♥♥♥♥ popping up .\n\nseriously, the quick time events are killing this series.\n\nbetter than operation racoon city in every regard. more interesting, and visually engaging than RE Revelations but the game play is worse.\n\nIf you haven't given up on the series after RE 5 , you probably will enjoy this one too, despite the overwhelming flaws that get in the way.  2 steps forward for the series, only to stumble and fall down and ultimately end up farther back than where you began.\n\nRevelations seems to be the step in the right direction, but there are elements of this game they really should keep.  "unlockables" in this game are pretty sad though. costumes only for multiplayer, not campaign. no secret weapons and unlimited ammo and guns can be picked as soon as you replay any chapter, at any time. shoot hidden medals for story files to read. reveals backstory.","January 25, 2015","true","114.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","0"

Suppose I'll just ramble a bit.\n\ntl;dr at the bottom\n\nThe gameplay is fairly solid and the action is exhilarating, for sure. The production values and graphics are impressive, and playing with a buddy in coop is a blast.\nHowever, what really brings this game down for me is the ludicrous story, illogical character actions, and punishing length of the game.\n\nThose sound like strange criticisms for a Resident Evil game, I know, but they truly transform this game into something that's not Resident Evil. The story is divided into four sections, with 3 of them following different sets of characters, and a final epilogue where everything is wrapped up neatly (that's not including the bonus add-on story mission). Though the action is always rising in pitch, it never truly felt like the story was moving along at the same pace; plot progression would be dragged back by long boss encounters and extensive action scenes where nothing is accomplished, aside from the characters receiving a couple extra scars...which is insane, since many of those sequences should have resulted in grisly death, not near-misses.\n\nAgain, seems like a strange criticism for a Resident Evil game, a series known for crazy nonsensical plot elements. But much like the film adaptations, RESIDENT EVIL 6 is an adrenaline-pounded sequel to a series that benefitted most on subtlety and horror, with only tiny slivers of its former glory tacked on.\n\nThe game is also brutally long. You'd think that more game equals better, right?\nThat's not the case here, unfortunately. The game is padded by extensive fight scenes, and progressing through the story feels like a drawn out chore rather than an enjoyable gauntlet. Just when you think you've reached the climax of the game, and must be close to the end, you end up playing for 3 more hours. THEN you're close to the end.\nIn the final chapters I just wanted the game to be over. I was tired of fighting the same boss, who would always "resurrect" himself with some new appendage or mutation. Having bosses continually come back certainly sucks the tension out of the game, when you expect that the abomination you just torched will arrive again in 10 minutes.\n\nRESIDENT EVIL 6 is also punishing to completionists: if you want to finish the game "100%" you'll have to go through the entire game TWICE, once as one character, then again as their partner. The play time I currently have logged is from going through the entire game (and the bonus mission) just once. I don't think I have the patience to go through the game a second time.\n\nAlso never expected to find continuity errors in a video game. Before the main game starts you have to play through a tutorial prologue that shows certain characters in peril. However, when you catch up to that point in the story in the main game things are completely different. The game lies to you right at the start, and changes certain events throughout the game as you switch between sets of characters. It's crazy.\n\nThough it has its moments, RESIDENT EVIL 6 isn't a game I want to revisit any time soon. Unless it goes on sale for like 5 bucks or something, I'd recommend avoiding this title.\n\n--------------\ntl;dr\n+Impressive graphics and production values\n+Solid gameplay elements\n+Action scenes are intense, though over the top\n+Best played with a friend; coop makes the game fun and enjoyable\n\n-Story is a large departure from other Resident Evil titles; nonsensical, illogical, over the top\n-Main characters are seemingly immortal\n-Game is frustratingly long and slowed down by too many battles\n-Bosses are regularly recycled and resurrected, eliminating tension\n-Story is plagued with continuity errors and plot holes\n-Lacks old Resident Evil charm","April 10, 2015","false","20.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

Over the series 20 year history, it has evolved and changed to stay keep up with modern gameplay and mechanics; pre-rendered back drops were ditched in favor of fully 3d modeled environments. Grid based tank controls and fixed camera angles evolved into a tight over the shoulder perspective with swifter character movement and a dedicated single player experience has been replaced by co-operative gameplay. While no one can accuse the franchise of failing to evolve, it's entirely fair to criticize what it has evolved into. Starting with RE4, the series morphed into a more action game, alienating purists but ultimately appealing to a larger audience. Resident Evil 6 is Capcom's attempt to give both purists and newcomers an agreeable middle ground by splitting the game into four smaller campaings with different protagonists and gameplay styles. The problem is that Capcom's attempt to please everyone has given us a game that fully pleases no one.\n\nPlayers take control of Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong in four separate but interwoven campaigns in an effort to combat the C-Virus. It's a globe spanning whodunit, though players will have cracked the game's mysteries long before the reveal. Players will benefit from having played the other titles in the series in order to have an understanding of the backgrounds of each character. The problem with Resident Evil 6's narrative is that it attempts to be a bigger, more bombastic version of the events in previous games but it only manages to feel needlessly convoluted and dry... The narratives of previous Resident Evil titles have had a silly B movie charm while lovingly fleshing out the game's mythos with countless files and documents. The increase in scope and size ruins the B movie charm but is still too absurd to have blockbuster appeal. The characters have been written into corners and their individual narratives are so complex and independent of each other that this attempt to write these series favorites into the same chain of events is forced and clumsy. It's clear that a narrative reboot is in order for the franchise to retain the charm and quality the first games were known for.\n\nGameplay has received and overhaul that moves Resident Evil further toward pure action. Characters can now aim while moving and heal with the press of a button. While these tweaks are convenient, they take away much of the tension present in previous entries to the franchise. A clunky Gears of War style cover system has also been added pushing the gameplay too far from the series' roots. Puzzles are restricted to Leon and Ada's campaign further betraying the roots of the series. In addition to these changes the game features idiotic cinematic action sequences on motorcycles, jets and snowmobiles that offer needless spectacle. The attempt to force these visually complex and flashy moments into the game cheapens the whole experience. Between the gunplay and watching your characters survive plane crashes, car crashes, helicopter crashes and surviving falls from high places a few zombies don't really pose a credible threat. With its ultra resilient characters Resident Evil 6 could be reskinned as a Justice League game with little effort. As with other action games expect an irritating amount of stick waggling and button mashing thanks to copious quick time events. A spare controller might be required. The melee system has been overhauled as well offering a number of context sensitive commands that frankly make it completely overpowered. Seriously, you can punch your way through half of the game on professional difficulty. It has never been easier to conserve ammo in a Resident Evil though it's not like the game isn't generous in that regard anyway. Speaking of conserving ammo, you will actually be spending most of your time dumping it on the ground thanks to a miserable inventory system. Your characters carry around more guns than John Matrix during the finale of Commando but it doesn't leave much room for bullets. There is also no item swapping between AI or human partners and the UI itself is atrocious.\n\nEach campaign generally offers a players a different flavor and some try to recall previous games in the franchise. Leon's campaign is our favorite since it is generally the most traditional. There are a few puzzles and the environments in his campaign are among the most atmospheric in the game. Chris' campaign is pretty much an unofficial Gear of War title, emphasizing gunplay and taking players through a fictional war torn eastern European country called Edonia. It's the weakest campaign in the game as a result of it's fixation with bullets and chest high walls. Jake Muller's campaign is interesting at first since he and series darling Sherry Birkin have to face off against a Nemesis-like creature called the Ustanak. Unlike Resident Evil 3 and Resident Evil 2's scenario B featuring Tyrant, the game design telegraphs the appearance of the Ustanak killing any tension or sense of unpredictability this unstoppable beast might have otherwise provided. The Ustanak also facilitates some of the obnoxious  action set pieces that force players into watching ♥♥♥♥♥♥, bloated cinematic sequences while mashing buttons during quick time events. Since Ada takes her campaign on alone it's more about stealth and offers several puzzles. It works well enough and comes out as one of the stronger campaigns. Having several interconnecting campaigns also means that you replay the same segments with multiple characters and it's completely unnecessary and lazy. If you are not playing the same sections with different characters you can expect to experience the same gameplay gimmicks; like finding three keys in a labyrinth of hallways while being chased by unkillable regenerators. It's like waking up in Bill Murray's shoes in Groundhog Day. Only worse.\n\nWhile it may sound like this is the most awful Resident Evil game to date, the truth is that it was one of the best action games on the market when it was released. When seen as a competitor to games like Gears of War it's stumbles and inconsistencies are more forgivable. The frustrating thing is there are moments in the game that are excellent and are a sign of what could have been if this game was focused on being a Resident Evil game first and pleasing a mass audience second. We expect moody atmosphere, slower paced gameplay and tension from anything in a box that says Resident Evil. In their attempt to give everyone something to like about this game they have created a game that lacks cohesion and focus. After experiencing one of Resident Evil 6's stand out moments, it doesn't take long before the game has your trudging through more cover based shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or waggling your stick like you're having a seizure.\n\nIt's four campaigns plus Mercenaries mode equates to over 100 hours of entertainment for fans. Each campaign attempts to use some of the best aspects of previous games to give players a total package. Yet, when it all comes together the only thing that makes it feel like a Resident Evil game are the familiar faces of Chris, Ada, Leon and Sherry. In an age where we often get so little for our buck, Capcom tried to give us everything fans could want but it's so inconsistent; wasting time and effort to give players glitz and spectacle instead of tension and scares. It would seem that the survival horror genre that we fell in love with in the 90's is dead. The twitch fodder hide and seek games that are now considered survival horror are mechanically shallow. I hope that the RE2 remake will remind Capcom why the franchise was brilliant.","April 8","false","7.6"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","1"

Hunting zombies with your own friends sometime better than hangout to the mall!\nThe co-op mode on the campaign and the extra modes give you more fun experience.\n\nThis game have 4 different story missions with a different movie cut-scene based on what character that you play.\n\n1. Leon F. Kenedy - Helena Harper\nOn this campaign, Leon still have his passion in the rainy, castle-ish, and underground stage. If you really curious how the "Pre-Lude" Mission starts and ends, you probably must play this story first. Remember, Leon is always come with Ada!\n\n2. Chris Redfield - Piers Nivans\nThis story line is about a BSAA missions, but i dont really know what the objectives is. I mean what actually Chris and Piers must do. The 3rd chapter will explain everything. This is a good campaign based on the weapon that they used. Remember, Chris is always against Ada!\n\n3. Jake Muller - Sherry Birkin\nBack to the racoon city accident, Sherry was saved by Leon ( i dont play the racoon city franchise yet). And Jack Muller is Albert Wesker's son (Well, in the movie it's on the 4th sequel). Sherry must save Jake for getting his blood/dna that contain an anti-body that come from his father Albert. This storyline is having more drama than zombie fight.\n\n4. Ada Wong - Agent (Agent is only when your friends joining, if not, you're totally alone)\nThis is Ada, this is the puzzle, and that how to story going. I'm not playing this story of her yet but based on another character cut-scene, Ada is there for helping them. 3 Different stories with 3 different saving missions, she is the volunteer of this game.\n\nAlso you must play the extra modes, unlock some bad-♥♥♥ costume and see how good are you for zombies!\nRemember,  There is no more HOPE!","February 28, 2015","true","37.5"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","15","29","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/221040/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","With Resident Evil 4, a video game series once known for survival horror and tank controls turned into a third person shooter with tank controls. Resident Evil 6 follows this direction even more consequently than previous installments. There's plenty to shoot, ammo is no longer scarce (true for every campaign save for Chris', for some reason), the characters are more agile than ever before and apart from Ada's campaign, every segment can be played cooperatively. Horror is only present in form of the various body horror moments, the monsters and the gore, of course. Little has changed in terms of mechanics and unless you were expecting survival horror to return, RE6 couldn't be better. In theory.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is just littered with bad design decisions. For instance, the dreaded button mashing sequences have returned - with a vengeance. While they have been relatively few in-between before, in RE6 you stumble over them every few steps. Every time you think the game finally lets you play, it snatches control away from you in favor of another chase sequence. And even though the characters are as agile as they can get in a Resident Evil game, the zombies can now leap 4 meters (if you're American, convert it) and every time they get hold of you, you will engage in yet another QTE square dance.\n\nIn a series that has been known for zombies, you fight relatively few of those. For the most part, enemies consist of gun-toting humanoid mutants, placing RE6 even closer to a run-of-the-mill third person shooter. In addition to that, the railroading is insane, the setpieces are not as varied or interesting as they could be and the story, while absolutely ridiculous, takes itself way too seriously. If I didn't know better, I'd say RE6 is a parody of current-gen game design.\n\nThere are four campaigns in total, which offer different play styles: Leon's campaign is the closest to the more traditional RE games and the only one featuring zombies, Chris' campaign is a full-on third person shooter, Jake's campaign plays like a hybrid of both and Ada's campaign focuses on what Capcom perceives as stealth. RE6 tries to have its cake and eat it, but ends up doing nothing right. As a result, the game feels weirdly unfocused and makes it evident that Capcom doesn't know where to take the series.\n\nDespite its glaring flaws, I can't bring myself to hate the game since the mechanics are rock-solid. The gunplay feels satisfying since zombies react properly to hits: A shot to the chest will throw them back or make them stagger; a shot to the leg will make them fall over, giving you enough time to line up additional shots or go for a melee finisher. Capcom even integrated a gore engine, which is always a nice touch in a game featuring the walking dead. RE6 is at its strongest when it's just pitting you against a horde of zombies and at its weakest when it's going for cinematic action. Unfortunately, moments like the latter are way too present. It almost seems like Capcom doesn't have any confidence in the game holding its own with all those other fancy third person shooters around.\n\nThere is a good game sleeping in here, mostly in the shape of the Mercenaries mode, which I enjoyed more than all four campaigns combined. Popping heads and body slamming zombies all day - this is what RE6 could have been: pure genocidal fun. It only takes a lot of digging to get there. If you like action games and have a high tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, check out RE6, but don't blame me if you want to fire it into the sun. In case you were expecting a return to the old days of survival horror: Don't even bother. Personally, I don't really care what you do with an established series as long as you do it right.\n\nI for one am looking forward to Resident Evil Kart.","December 25, 2013","true","54.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

Of course the story could use a reboot.","June 30, 2014","true","49.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ada's campaign should be done last, as it pulls everything together and provides backstory.\n\nIf you're used to RE games, play this on Professional or No Hope. The game is far easier than RE4 and RE5 on similar difficulties (Professional in RE6 is ~ equivalent to Normal in  RE5, and No Hope is equivalent to a fresh Veteran run).

I recommend at least buying it at a sale price and trying it out for yourself before judging it. Many have issues with how the game controls but once you understand how the game works you'll find that it has an in-depth combat mechanic/system that takes quite a bit of skill to master and get used to. The game's problem is giving you an extensive combat system with so many things to do but not explaining how the game works and how you should play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gurulon/recommended/221040/","Gurulon","Mc Quiver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gurulon/","179 products in account","Well, It's a good action game, pretty much like RE5 was, tough much of the complaints about the game are exactly about that. It no longer feels like a "Resident Evil" game to be honest (even less so than RE5), but that doesn't mean it's bad, it's actually pretty fun. The 3 different campaigns change things up quite a bit in terms of ambience: Leon's is a little bit slower paced, similar to RE4, Jake's is more like RE5, and Chris's is much more action oriented. The 3 play pretty much the same, but they "feel" different, and that's good. There's also a 4th campaign with Ada, which is probably the best one since it feels more like old-school RE than any other thing in RE6.\n\nWeapons and inventory systems are poorly designed, just like the ones in RE5. They're functional, but they could've done a better job at it. Weapon customization is gone, replaced by a skills system, which is not too bad, but you don't feel as involved in it as in previous games... you just select a few passives and that's it. Combat is much improved, with more mobility for characters and ways to dodge enemy attacks. Play as Chris and you might think a mutant with a rocket launcher would be worse than regular zombies, but play as Leon and you'll see how dangerous zombies can be. Overall, it's a very entertaining game. The plot is fine, it's great to see some familiar faces again, and the new ones are interesting enough to justify maybe a sequel with only them, who knows. Monsters are varied and fun, and mosts levels offer a decent challenge, and are varied enough too.\n\nMercenaries is no doubt the best of the series, and once you finish every campaign, it'll probably be a good time sink if you're into it. Here is more evident than ever where the new combat features shine. And about multiplayer... almost nobody plays anything else other than Mercenaries, the DLC modes are empty all the time, so they're not worth getting, since you need people to play them with and no one ever does. Integration with RE.net doesn't solve that, sadly. Co-op is nice, and not nearly as annoying as it was in RE5. That being said, in the single player campaign, your partner is actually helpful, not a burden like before.\n\nFor all old Resident Evil fans, my recommendation would be to treat this game as something else, based on the world of Resident Evil. In the story, over the years things have been escalating, and now everything everywhere is messed up, not just a Mansion/Precint/Small Town, so it's hard to think how we could get back those slow, scary and suspenseful moments from previous games. I know Revelations tried, but if feels dated and comparably too slow and shallow. You'll find some of that tense vibe here tough (with Leon and Ada, and sometimes Jake), but not that often. For anyone else, just try it, it's a fun experience. As an action game, it's great.","November 29, 2013","true","95.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

That's because those games didn't have zombies and this does and like I said, just everything about the game is done much better than those games combined. The only serious flaw with it is that it is very linear. You can re-run a campaign as the second character to make it a little more interesting. The herb system is the best one yet in a RE game: you find herbs, hit a key to automatically combine them and add them to your inventory as pills, then hit 1 to take a pill. It couldn't be more simple, yet some reviewers complained about it, lol. They also complained about there being so many quick time events. QTE's killed RE5 and ♥♥♥♥♥ it of a lot of fun, they were horrible, especially the QTE Wesker fight. But they are done differently here and are actually fine. However still annoying: QTE's DO NOT belong in ANY games. They do not constitute actual gameplay, they are just a bother.\nThe only enemies in RE4 were incest loving hillbillies and in RE5 99% of enemies were shirtless black guys. Thankfully RE6 brought back ZOMBIES! FINALLY. GOD DUDE? ♥♥♥♥ing Capcom. Amazed this was such a good port because normally they can't port for ♥♥♥♥.\nThe women are super hot and the game is a blast. If it were not for its high linearity, it would be a 9/10 easily. As it stands though, 7/10, buy this for sure.","February 17, 2015","true","42.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Playing local co-op with my brothers was something that was insanely fun, though playing any game in co-op can sometimes mask the issues with an average or worse game. While RE5 was not a small game, the direct chapter progression was enjoyable; you could play the game in smaller chunks and never feel committed to exceedingly long play sessions. However, RE6 just feels comparatively massive, with some chapters taking 90 minutes or more to complete on first go though. This result in there being a sort of invisible deterrent to actually starting up the game for me, knowing that I might not see my first results screen for a significant period of time.\n\nThe gameplay is largely improved, with a more modern TPS-like combat system along with some deeper close range abilities and quick fire mechanics that allow for slightly more interesting ways to survive the zombie hoards. The game remains highly cinematic and enjoyable and the voice acting is generally top notch. However, the game itself just seems very soulless. I don’t care for any of the characters, I feel nothing when someone dies (regardless of importance), and having so many branching story arches means that not enough time is really spent getting to know any one person or understanding any one situation. There’s a point in the game where a bio-nuke of sort hits a city and another where a playable character effectively condemns himself and yet there just simply no sense of weight to the situations at all. Another shortcoming is a  prevalent use of instant fail QTEs or QTE like sections where you have to do something such as run a particular direction in a particular manner in a particular amount of time or be instantly offed because the game demands it. I had significantly more deaths of this variety than that of dying by making mistakes in combat or such.

Yeah this game is a little more action than horror, but it fixed the crappy movement of old RE series. If you think lack of survival, the try NO HOPE difficulty. I had try Leon story and it is really challenging. The story may be a little bit awkward and doensn't make senses sometime but it is a game so just enjoy it.\nThere are still few gliches and minor bug like when I played mercenaries using Chris and I sliding while running the my char was sinking into earth which make me had to end the game. But there are a lot of game with worse problem, so as long it didn't happened occasionally I could stand with it.\nI played co op mode with my cousin and it really do have double fun since the AI won't make mistakes and have unlimited ammo while my cousin do a lot more joke.\nWeaponry is a little bit different than RE4 or RE5. I prefer the previous series weaponry which allow me to freely customize and upgrade my shotgun.\nLeon story bring back the memories of Raccoon city, Chris story has a lot more gunfight like a RE5, Jake story a little bit more like RE3 when ustanak chases him and Sherry over and over, and lastly Ada story just like RE4 when you play a solo game.\nIn the end my suggestion is if you have a friend or family who share the loves of RE series then play this game coop, it worth your time.","January 31, 2014","true","83.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's just "Yes" or "No."  I can't say to stay away from this game entirely.  There are merits.  However, for fans of the RE series, this is an utter disappointment. I didn't play the game until it had been out for a year or so.  I read the reviews ahead of time and thought, "They are blowing this out of proportion.  It can't be that bad."  Well, I was wrong.  Compared to the other games in the series, it is pablum.  It is generic.  And I think that is the biggest criticism that I can come up with.  It doesn't allow for a deep, immersive experience because it doesn't provide for an individualized experience.  It takes you by the hand, tells you where to go, and lets you shoot in the meantime.  The story element is intriguing.  I enjoy having the stories overlap to tell a complete one ala the movie "Go."  But this game is as generic as they come.  When will developers learn that we would rather have a little exploration than a big explosion?  If this game was producd by Michael Bay, I wouldn't be surprised.  Let's hope they get this game back to what made it popular in the first place.  Changing that is just dumb.  Make another game if you want to cater to the explosive junkies.  Don't ruin what you have built by catering to the least common denominator.","March 6, 2014","true","48.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ammo is plentiful, there are no jump scares, and the majority of the combat is fast and quick, not slow and threatening. While the plot measures up to Resident Evil 6 standards of being stupidly, hilariously bad and awesome, and the tone is ominous, this game does not stick to the roots in the gameplay. It's action horror, not survival horror.\n\nI cannot and will not hold that against the game though, because the new system is so solid. It's quick, responsive, lets the player easily keep pace with the action going on around them, and has a cover system that feels more fluid than a lot of other 3rd person shooters. The melee combat works well enough, the enemies are varied and always pose a challenge, and all of this works together with one of the more fluid co-op experiences I've ever seen.\n\nDon't expect many people online to just drop in with you, as the PC version isn't the most well-populated Co-op place. That's not a problem though, because the game's partner AI is both invulnerable, and hyper-competent. You'll have no trouble getting through the game. And it's a good port too; better graphics (even better if you want to slap ENB or SweetFX on), and  all the quicktime events indicate the actual keys you bound, not just "HIT ATTACK? OH GOD WHAT DID I BIND ATTACK TO".\n\nIf you're a fan of Resident Evil and won't mind a fast-paced shooter version of it, buy this now. If you see this game on sale for 20 bucks and want to know if it's worth it, it is. You'll easily get 15-20 hours of good single player out of it, plus the multiplayer modes.","December 15, 2013","true","18.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's also some multiplayer modes, but no one plays them. The mercenaries mode is as fun as before, and there are 9 characters to pick from, 16 if you count the alternate costumes. As for the campaigns:\n\nLeon: Touted as the best campaign, it's the lengthiest and the 'main' one, since more of the plotline is revealed. Overall decent, some chapters are better than others. Chapter 1 is linear as ♥♥♥♥ and a missed opportunity, while chapter 4 and 5 is  the game's crowning achievement.\n\nChris: zombies with guns; turns into a bland third person shooter in chapter 2; gets good again in the following chapter. Overall the weakest campaign because it tries to be a generic third person shooter.\n\nJake: an interesting campaign. It tries being like RE3, but the creature chasing you disappears a fifth of the way into the game before reappearing randomly at the end. Overall it's a level below Leon's campaign.\n\nAda: My pick for the best campaign; it's built as a single player experience with a lot more puzzles and sneaking around than the other campaigns. The entire story comes together here, winds up being kinda silly and simplistic.\n\nAll in all I'd say around a 6 or 7.

The biggest plus of this game is the story. There are four connected campaigns with 7 main characters who meet each other at some points of the story. All these campaigns differ due to the different characters.\n\nIf you choose to play Leon's story - it's classical Resident Evil: there are puzzles, horror and some shooting. Chris's campaign is more of a shooter because he's a soldier. If you play Jake's campaign - it's action with elements of melee combat and stealth. Ada's campaign is the most difficult because you play solo. It contains puzzles and action sequences.\n\nGraphics are pretty good, especially the main characters. Although, the environment textures are sometimes awful.\n\nAll in all it's a good port to PC, though controls sometimes get uncomfortable because of camera angle.\n\nI give this game 9 out of 10. It took me more than 25 hours to beat all 4 campaigns.

That's their opinion.\n\nIf there is one significant element in Resident Evil 6, it's the NUMBER. The number 6, something significant, something I haven't FELT since I have played that game back then. Megaman X6 was that game and it WAS HARD. But I enjoyed it, and I have felt the same way I have died so many times here in Resident Evil 6, call it CHEAP DEATH but whoever said dying in a megaman game was also a CHEAP DEATH? Same thing.\n\nEverything was griping in the game, from start to finish. From the way I rushed the hordes of J'avos to the stealth game of Ada's. I had to point out though that Ada's Bowgun was surprisingly weak. That's my only complaint but it's pretty minor and I'll get used to it.\n\nAnyway, I'll stop the spoiler from here. Resident Evil 6 is for people who like their game on a hardcore tension. It's not a walk in the park and it's not going to win the hearts of most gamers today. But it's more of a Fan Service for gamers who like their game tough and a lot of Cheap Deaths on the side.","August 10, 2013","true","81.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/221040/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","With Resident Evil 4, a video game series once known for survival horror and tank controls turned into a third person shooter with tank controls. Resident Evil 6 follows this direction even more consequently than previous installments. There's plenty to shoot, ammo is no longer scarce (true for every campaign save for Chris', for some reason), the characters are more agile than ever before and apart from Ada's campaign, every segment can be played cooperatively. Horror is only present in form of the various body horror moments, the monsters and the gore, of course. Little has changed in terms of mechanics and unless you were expecting survival horror to return, RE6 couldn't be better. In theory.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is just littered with bad design decisions. For instance, the dreaded button mashing sequences have returned - with a vengeance. While they have been relatively few in-between before, in RE6 you stumble over them every few steps. Every time you think the game finally lets you play, it snatches control away from you in favor of another chase sequence. And even though the characters are as agile as they can get in a Resident Evil game, the zombies can now leap 4 meters (if you're American, convert it) and every time they get hold of you, you will engage in yet another QTE square dance.\n\nIn a series that has been known for zombies, you fight relatively few of those. For the most part, enemies consist of gun-toting humanoid mutants, placing RE6 even closer to a run-of-the-mill third person shooter. In addition to that, the railroading is insane, the setpieces are not as varied or interesting as they could be and the story, while absolutely ridiculous, takes itself way too seriously. If I didn't know better, I'd say RE6 is a parody of current-gen game design.\n\nThere are four campaigns in total, which offer different play styles: Leon's campaign is the closest to the more traditional RE games and the only one featuring zombies, Chris' campaign is a full-on third person shooter, Jake's campaign plays like a hybrid of both and Ada's campaign focuses on what Capcom perceives as stealth. RE6 tries to have its cake and eat it, but ends up doing nothing right. As a result, the game feels weirdly unfocused and makes it evident that Capcom doesn't know where to take the series.\n\nDespite its glaring flaws, I can't bring myself to hate the game since the mechanics are rock-solid. The gunplay feels satisfying since zombies react properly to hits: A shot to the chest will throw them back or make them stagger; a shot to the leg will make them fall over, giving you enough time to line up additional shots or go for a melee finisher. Capcom even integrated a gore engine, which is always a nice touch in a game featuring the walking dead. RE6 is at its strongest when it's just pitting you against a horde of zombies and at its weakest when it's going for cinematic action. Unfortunately, moments like the latter are way too present. It almost seems like Capcom doesn't have any confidence in the game holding its own with all those other fancy third person shooters around.\n\nThere is a good game sleeping in here, mostly in the shape of the Mercenaries mode, which I enjoyed more than all four campaigns combined. Popping heads and body slamming zombies all day - this is what RE6 could have been: pure genocidal fun. It only takes a lot of digging to get there. If you like action games and have a high tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, check out RE6, but don't blame me if you want to fire it into the sun. In case you were expecting a return to the old days of survival horror: Don't even bother. Personally, I don't really care what you do with an established series as long as you do it right.\n\nI for one am looking forward to Resident Evil Kart.","December 25, 2013","true","54.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

That's because those games didn't have zombies and this does and like I said, just everything about the game is done much better than those games combined. The only serious flaw with it is that it is very linear. You can re-run a campaign as the second character to make it a little more interesting. The herb system is the best one yet in a RE game: you find herbs, hit a key to automatically combine them and add them to your inventory as pills, then hit 1 to take a pill. It couldn't be more simple, yet some reviewers complained about it, lol. They also complained about there being so many quick time events. QTE's killed RE5 and ♥♥♥♥♥ it of a lot of fun, they were horrible, especially the QTE Wesker fight. But they are done differently here and are actually fine. However still annoying: QTE's DO NOT belong in ANY games. They do not constitute actual gameplay, they are just a bother.\nThe only enemies in RE4 were incest loving hillbillies and in RE5 99% of enemies were shirtless black guys. Thankfully RE6 brought back ZOMBIES! FINALLY. GOD DUDE? ♥♥♥♥ing Capcom. Amazed this was such a good port because normally they can't port for ♥♥♥♥.\nThe women are super hot and the game is a blast.

This is indeed a classic Resident Evil game. Better than 4 and all that came before it. It may not be as slow paced as the older games, but it definately keeps the same vibe.

RE 6 keeps you in a game from start to the end. Good multiplayer modes that keeps you in a game after campaign completion for a lot of time. Good campaign and multiplayer replayability.\nThis game much better than RE 5, but slightly below RE 4(due to lack of puzzles plurality).\n\nI am surprised, of what Game Press waited of this game(maybe some innovations, new gameplay features or something else...) This game was not going to follow the canons of the survivor-horror classic from the start of developing. It's just a good continuation of a Resident Evil Franchise, no more, no less...\n\nThis game is clearly deserving of assessment is not less than 8.\n\nBut I have two bad parts of this PC port:\n1)a LOT OF bugs, and consoles controls(you'll see it well in the Creatures' gameplay), low customizable controls... (I think it's more likely to be fixed with a future patches in the next six months(I hope so))\n2)Bad graphics and graphic customization and very low resolution of Textures.(Comparing with Resident Evil 5...)\n\nI think for 6 months, CAPCOM could make a better PC port.

Přečti si Shrnutí!\n\nResident Evil 6/ Biohazard 6 (originalní název) je third-person akční lineární střílečka, dělaná pro dva hráče.\nZačal bych kampaní, za kterou bych přidal dost bodíků. Kampaň je dlouhá a dokonce rozčleněná na 5 etap a ty etapy ještě na kapitoly. Kampaň má dokupy něco kolem 30 hodin, což je víc než dostačující.\nNalezneme zde Intro, což je, jak již název napovídá, pouze jeden level kde nás hra seznámí co a jak.\n\nKampaně -\nLeonovu kampaň. Tato kampaň je takové vaše typické moderní Resident Evil, procházíme různé lokace, střílíme klasické zombie a sem tam potkáme něco silnějšího. U mě je tato kampaň na druhém místě ze čtyř dostupných. (nepočítám intro)\n\nChrisovo kampaň. Hrajeme za člena BSAA Chrise Redfielda a nebo za jeho parťáka Pierse Nivanse a snažíme se ,jako každý charakter ze hry, polapit Adu Wong a zachránit svět před hromadným Bio útokem. Tahle recenze není spoiler free takže dál k tomu nic.\nAvšak kdybych měl kampaň zhodnotit tak Chrisovo je asi nejhorší, stále není špatná, ale ze všech dostupných je nejhorší.\n\nJakeovo kampaň. Hrajeme zde za Jakea nebo Sherry a tahle kampaň má dle mě tu nejzajímavější zápletku a i levely. Jake je imunní vůči C-Viru a Sherry má zajistit aby se v bezpečí dostal do laborek a oni mohli udělat vakcínu. Avšak Ada si to nenechá líbit a pošle nezničitelného Ustanaka který ma za každou cenu zabít Jakea a donést ho k ní. A bude se snažit fakt tvrdě. Tato kampaň je jednoznačně u mě na prvním místě.\n\nA jako poslední tu máme kampaň Ady Wong. Která se mi zas líbí ve faktu že je dost odlišná od ostatních. Není v ní až tolik akce a v první misi se máte dokonce snažit jí projít stealth, což mě docela překvapilo na moderní Resident Evil. Ačkoliv i přesto jí mám na druhém nejhorším místě, hned za Chrisem.\n\n\nGameplay -\nJak bylo zmiňováno na začátku, toto RE si opět zahrajeme z pohledu třetí osoby. Budeme sbírat náboje do 400 typů zbraní, hledat skill pointy a taky marně koukat po Zelených rostlinách které jaksi charakter zpracuje a pak si z nich dobijí život. To taky není žádná novinka. Ačkoliv, byl zlepšen aiming systém. A jde to vidět. Znatelně se zde líp míří než v RE5. Stále to není úplně ťip ťop ale přesto ukázka zlepšení tu je.\nCo se týče movementu, máme tu celkem dost tlačítek. Můžeme sprintovat, chodit pomalu, dodgovat dopředu i do stran a bůh ví co ještě. Takže tady je toho nejspíš dost.\nZároveň co mi přišlo dost zajímavé je to, že i přesto že hra používá milion tlačítek na různé akce, tak např. na reload a sbírání věcí je to samé tlačítko! Což mi ale nakonec přišlo docela pohodlné.\n\nOvládání -\nK tomuhle mám několik věcí co říct. Je to šílené, ne tak jako ARMA ale stálé ŠÍLENÉ! Je tu milion akcí na různá tlačítka a do toho i další milion kombinací. Já osobně jsem si např. změnil přehazování itemů na  3+M3 a přeházování zbraní je klasicky M3 (kolečky u myši), takže to byla ukázka.\nZároveň tu je opět i omezený system inventáře. REovsky tak omezený že často nevíte co byste radši vyměnili za ten herb. Ale tady se mi taky naskytl problem který jsem nijak neřešil takže nevím jestli je to dost vzácný problem a nebo to dokonce ani není problem jen jsem nepochopil mechaniky hry, ale občas když jsem otevřel inventář tak se mi nezobrazil kursor. Což je problem protože pak nebylo nijak možné vyhodit věci. (Teda aspoň si to myslím, klávesově jsem to nedokázal, možná byl způsob. Ani já tu hru nemam od A do Z proštudovanou.)\n\nGrafika -\nOpět pokrok od RE5, stále to není tak parádní, ale máme tu nějaké hezké efekty, osvětlení a další věcičky. O grafiku se tolik nezájímám takže to je asi vše k tomu.\n\nMechaniky hry -\nTady bych vytknul jednu věc, sice jednu ale kritickou. Hra si přímo ZAKLÁDÁ na Quick time eventech. Unikni zombie tak že budeš klikat pravé a levé tlačítko myší. Odkopni zombie tak že ve správnou dobu klikneš. Mačkej zběsile R aby si otočil páčkou á však to znáte. Ale tady je to až tak šílené použito ve všem, až je to otravné.\nSkills, po kapitolách naleznete i sběratelské předměty včetně skill pointu. Což trochu zachovává replayabilitě. Sbíráte emblemy abyste si otevřeli dokumenty a "figurky" hrdinů. A taky dáváte dohromady skill pointy abyste si odemkli vylepšení pro samo sebe. Klasika ale pro spoustu lidí zábavná věc.\n\nBonusy -\nVe hře je kromě te 30ti hodinové kampaně dokonce DALŠÍ MOŽNOST. Když nemluvím o placených DLC tak máte i po dohrání kampaně možnost si zahrát Mercenries mod, který teda mě osobně dost baví. Je to klasický Horde mode. Zvolíte mapu, každá má své preset nepřátele, zvolíte charaktera. (A to radši pečlivě, nejen že každý jinak vypadá, ale á i jiný loadout!) Případně si najdete partnera (což doporučuji) a jedete. Drtíte zombíky tak abyste nasbírali, pokud možno s partnerovou pomocí, co největší ba-i maximalni combo. Co je na tom všem ještě lepší je fakt, že abyste odemkli další mapu či charaktera, musíte již odemknuté mapy dát na Rank A-S, což jsou ty dva nejlepší pochopitelně. Takže to je taková malá motivace abyste to zvládli. Protože nová mapa nejen že otvírá nové možnosti ale některé z nich i nové nepřátele.\nA kdyby vás už i Mercenaries nebavili mužete si trochu připlatit za další bonusové mody.\n\n\n~SHRNUTÍ~\nRE6 je jasný pokrok od RE5, stále se drží toho akčníího formátu než toho survival horror. Ale já jsem zastánce obojího takže to pro mě nijak není problem.\n+Grafika\n+Vylepšený aiming system\n+Zábavné levely\n+Klišovitý ale poměrně dobrý děj\n+Délka hrací doby\n+Variace hratelných postav\n+Spoustu zbraní\n+Bonusové mody\n\n-Quick time eventy everywhere\n-Občas špatná odpověď na akce hráče, čili prohrajete ikdyž za to uplně nemužete (opět s tim maji co dočinění QTE)\n-Voice chat je horrible a nedá se vypnout\n-Type chat neexistuje\n-Občasné mizení cursoru v inventáři\n\n7.5/10 - Jako fan RE mě to bavilo, ale pro někoho kdo RE nikdy nehrál a toto bude jeho první zažítek, tak meh, to radši ne. Zkuste RE1 nebo 4, lépe vám to ukáže čeho je RE schopné.","August 11, 2015","true","75.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It's just "Yes" or "No."  I can't say to stay away from this game entirely.  There are merits.  However, for fans of the RE series, this is an utter disappointment. I didn't play the game until it had been out for a year or so.  I read the reviews ahead of time and thought, "They are blowing this out of proportion.  It can't be that bad."  Well, I was wrong.  Compared to the other games in the series, it is pablum.  It is generic.  And I think that is the biggest criticism that I can come up with.  It doesn't allow for a deep, immersive experience because it doesn't provide for an individualized experience.  It takes you by the hand, tells you where to go, and lets you shoot in the meantime.  The story element is intriguing.  I enjoy having the stories overlap to tell a complete one ala the movie "Go."  But this game is as generic as they come.  When will developers learn that we would rather have a little exploration than a big explosion?  If this game was producd by Michael Bay, I wouldn't be surprised.  Let's hope they get this game back to what made it popular in the first place.  Changing that is just dumb.  Make another game if you want to cater to the explosive junkies.  Don't ruin what you have built by catering to the least common denominator.","March 6, 2014","true","48.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ammo is plentiful, there are no jump scares, and the majority of the combat is fast and quick, not slow and threatening. While the plot measures up to Resident Evil 6 standards of being stupidly, hilariously bad and awesome, and the tone is ominous, this game does not stick to the roots in the gameplay. It's action horror, not survival horror.\n\nI cannot and will not hold that against the game though, because the new system is so solid. It's quick, responsive, lets the player easily keep pace with the action going on around them, and has a cover system that feels more fluid than a lot of other 3rd person shooters. The melee combat works well enough, the enemies are varied and always pose a challenge, and all of this works together with one of the more fluid co-op experiences I've ever seen.\n\nDon't expect many people online to just drop in with you, as the PC version isn't the most well-populated Co-op place. That's not a problem though, because the game's partner AI is both invulnerable, and hyper-competent. You'll have no trouble getting through the game. And it's a good port too; better graphics (even better if you want to slap ENB or SweetFX on), and  all the quicktime events indicate the actual keys you bound, not just "HIT ATTACK? OH GOD WHAT DID I BIND ATTACK TO".\n\nIf you're a fan of Resident Evil and won't mind a fast-paced shooter version of it, buy this now. If you see this game on sale for 20 bucks and want to know if it's worth it, it is. You'll easily get 15-20 hours of good single player out of it, plus the multiplayer modes.","December 15, 2013","true","18.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I almost quit the game before I was done with the intro, as I thought that was the actual game. Once I started with Leon's campaign, I re-evaluated the game and actually found myself liking it. It captured the horror/survival game we all know and love about the Resident Evil series.\n\nUnfortunatly Leon's campaign is just 1 out of 4. If you play the campaigns in order, the game gets worse and worse. Chris's campaign takes us away from the horror/survival genre and put us in a bizarre 3rd person shooter game that takes place in East Europe. Still the campaign was okay.\n\nJake's campaign gets even worse. We're still in East Europe, and we spend most of our time running from stuff. With a car, with a motorcycle, with a snowmobile, on a boat and by foot. A lot of the time we are running with a fixed position camera angle, which annoyed the crap out of me.\n\nDear CapCom running away in an intense situation with a fixed camera position doesn't make the game more intresting, it makes it annoying. No one likes it when you run forward using "W key" just to all of a sudden have to use the "A key" in order to run straight forward. If you got  great scenery you wanna show off, find some other way to do it.\n\nThe 4th and final is Ada's campaign. After playing through the first chapter, I really feel I don't want to continue playing this game. Again we find outselves running from everything. We have to stealth and avoid enemies, we have to climb ladders and swim on a timer.\n\nFeel free to throw 100's of brain eating zombies at me. Give me puzzles to solve, make me fight unreasonable big and hard bosses. But don't ask me to stealth and run away from everything. Don't give me mini-cutscenes in the middle of a boss fight. And for the love of God, let me decide from what angle I want the camera!\n\nI'm really sorry to say, but I don't recommend this game. At least not if you like horror/survivor games. I really wish capaign 2, 3 & 4 were more simmilar to the first one. But it seems that CapCom decided to try and please everyone, by making each campaign aimed at different types of players. I'm sorry Capcom, but instead of pleasing a greater audience, you now have people hating 75% of the game. I don't see how it's possible to enjoy all 4 campaigns.\n\nIt's as absurd as if you were to make the next Tomb Raider 25% Tomb Raider, 25% Mario-Kart, 25% Silent Hill and 25% Farmville. Chose 1 line and stick to that.","August 14, 2014","false","53.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I have played every single Resident Evil title. I have the game on my PS3 so my gametime is more than it is shown on my Steam account. The game is not that bad, but there are some VERY annoying things. Try to walk while aimming WTF?!? Why is Leon hopping? Is he Bugs Bunny with an ACME gun or it is just bugs? I was wondering what game am I playing - WWE or Resident Evil. What are these deadly skills of even Helena? How can a woman wreck you this way? These things do not really happen in real life but whatever it is Resident Evil not Sims. So far I can say that Resident Evil 4 is far better than this game and still the best title from the series.

Sadly thanks to the depressed butt hurt fans who desperately want to return to the past just like any other long running game series (aka final fantasy) the game doesn't do so well in the eyes of the public. To be honest it has the best action, best textures, graphics and the longest bunch of campaigns with so many modes then any of the other resident evil titles before it. The ability to move and shoot was long over do and to be honest people need to just accept that in life things change. So what if it's not scary enough, it sure is hell is fun. Sure some franchises should go back to their roots like Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon. However, Resident Evil has improved both graphically and story wise. Why would we want to return to a game setting that got a place in the guisness world records for worst voice acting in a video game? Like the annoying butt hurt fans of final fantasy who dislike where the series it going, just accept it for what it is now. So please take a chance on this game and final fantasy 15, you won't be disapointed.","June 10, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreakon/recommended/221040/","dreakon","Dreakon13","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreakon/","590 products in account","One of my favorite titles in the third-person shooter genre.\n\nA good example where the sum of it's parts are greater than the individual pieces.  The controls can be clunky and overcomplicated (use a gamepad), quick-time events are always a point of contention, the graphics (while very good) can be a bit underwhelming in spots, the interface is odd and takes time to familiarize yourself with, the story is completely over the top...\n\nBut the way it's all wrapped together just works so well.  It's an immense coop experience.  It's a very long experience by third person shooter standards (roughly 20-25 hours for a complete playthrough of all campaigns) and honestly I loved almost every bit of it.  Heh.  Most of these "flaws" are really just a matter of getting used to change.  This isn't the Resident Evil of old, and convention is regularly defied.  Which isn't always a bad thing, but you'll have to adjust for it.  The tension of tip-toeing and backtracking through a mansion for hours on 10 bullets is replaced with shootouts, explosions and grandeous boss battles.  The "zombies" often have guns.\n\nIf you can manage to appreciate that this is an action game first, and Resident Evil second... go in with an open mind, and more importantly, go in with a friend... you'll have a great time.  The little flaws will be almost endearing in the bigger picture.\n\nIf you can't appreciate that... odds are the issues I mentioned above could ruin it for you.","February 15, 2014","true","64.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","2"

They do not, however, make playing, or even beating the game impossible!\nOverall, this is a relatively fun game that many will rate somewhat above its realistic quality.

Yes, the writing is mostly a joke — it resembles the movies too much, and goes nowhere interesting. The palette is pretty boring, or at least it bored me; there's too many washed out blues, reds, and purples throughout the game. The camera was jerky at times (though the initial complaints of it being too zoomed in was something I never understood). Leon is no longer funny and Helena is even worse. Some enemies reminded me too much of L4D, a game which I was not a huge fan of. Cover shooting is kind of tacked on. That's about it.\n\nThis game is still good. There's so much content here. 4 different campaigns, each with several different environments you play through. There are SO many environments in this game! There's also a ton of enemies; granted, many of them are just small variations of one another, but it's still an impressive amount overall. There's plenty of weapons, the melee system has been revamped, the inventory has been revamped... Capcom really put a lot of effort into the game. No Mercy Mercenaries is also incredible and totally blows Resident Evil 5 Mercenaries out of the water. The co-op action and content of this game more or less makes Resident Evil 5 unplayable and irrelevant now.\n\nToo many people, mostly nostalgia-driven, played this just looking for something to complain about I think. They failed to realize all the great things it did as a result. For example, the campaign intersections — who ever brings those up? Except those were awesome and were no doubt an idea from the director Eiichiro Sasaki who also directed the Outbreak games. The intersections added a layer of immersion not seen before in games, it reminded you that other players were going through the other campaigns and thus made the story feel like it was happening in real-time. This new dimension of campaign storytelling was an ambitious improvement, apparently too ambitious because nobody even recognized how amazing it was! The combat system is also so intricately balanced and complex here, that many people end up just complaining that it's too hard; they say there isn't enough ammo in the game, or the camera is too hard to control, when these things simply weren't the case. I ranked in the top 10 in Mercenaries the first month of release prior to any camera patches, any complaints about the camera are a complete result of utter incompetence in my opinion.\n\nOverall it's not the best Resident Evil, and it's not the best game of all time, but it was still a very good game. The hate was uncalled for. If you want to play No Mercy on PC with me feel free to hit me up, I'm down for that any day.","January 21, 2014","true","33.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Přečti si Shrnutí!\n\nResident Evil 6/ Biohazard 6 (originalní název) je third-person akční lineární střílečka, dělaná pro dva hráče.\nZačal bych kampaní, za kterou bych přidal dost bodíků. Kampaň je dlouhá a dokonce rozčleněná na 5 etap a ty etapy ještě na kapitoly. Kampaň má dokupy něco kolem 30 hodin, což je víc než dostačující.\nNalezneme zde Intro, což je, jak již název napovídá, pouze jeden level kde nás hra seznámí co a jak.\n\nKampaně -\nLeonovu kampaň. Tato kampaň je takové vaše typické moderní Resident Evil, procházíme různé lokace, střílíme klasické zombie a sem tam potkáme něco silnějšího. U mě je tato kampaň na druhém místě ze čtyř dostupných. (nepočítám intro)\n\nChrisovo kampaň. Hrajeme za člena BSAA Chrise Redfielda a nebo za jeho parťáka Pierse Nivanse a snažíme se ,jako každý charakter ze hry, polapit Adu Wong a zachránit svět před hromadným Bio útokem. Tahle recenze není spoiler free takže dál k tomu nic.\nAvšak kdybych měl kampaň zhodnotit tak Chrisovo je asi nejhorší, stále není špatná, ale ze všech dostupných je nejhorší.\n\nJakeovo kampaň. Hrajeme zde za Jakea nebo Sherry a tahle kampaň má dle mě tu nejzajímavější zápletku a i levely. Jake je imunní vůči C-Viru a Sherry má zajistit aby se v bezpečí dostal do laborek a oni mohli udělat vakcínu. Avšak Ada si to nenechá líbit a pošle nezničitelného Ustanaka který ma za každou cenu zabít Jakea a donést ho k ní. A bude se snažit fakt tvrdě. Tato kampaň je jednoznačně u mě na prvním místě.\n\nA jako poslední tu máme kampaň Ady Wong. Která se mi zas líbí ve faktu že je dost odlišná od ostatních. Není v ní až tolik akce a v první misi se máte dokonce snažit jí projít stealth, což mě docela překvapilo na moderní Resident Evil. Ačkoliv i přesto jí mám na druhém nejhorším místě, hned za Chrisem.\n\n\nGameplay -\nJak bylo zmiňováno na začátku, toto RE si opět zahrajeme z pohledu třetí osoby. Budeme sbírat náboje do 400 typů zbraní, hledat skill pointy a taky marně koukat po Zelených rostlinách které jaksi charakter zpracuje a pak si z nich dobijí život. To taky není žádná novinka. Ačkoliv, byl zlepšen aiming systém. A jde to vidět. Znatelně se zde líp míří než v RE5. Stále to není úplně ťip ťop ale přesto ukázka zlepšení tu je.\nCo se týče movementu, máme tu celkem dost tlačítek. Můžeme sprintovat, chodit pomalu, dodgovat dopředu i do stran a bůh ví co ještě. Takže tady je toho nejspíš dost.\nZároveň co mi přišlo dost zajímavé je to, že i přesto že hra používá milion tlačítek na různé akce, tak např. na reload a sbírání věcí je to samé tlačítko! Což mi ale nakonec přišlo docela pohodlné.\n\nOvládání -\nK tomuhle mám několik věcí co říct. Je to šílené, ne tak jako ARMA ale stálé ŠÍLENÉ! Je tu milion akcí na různá tlačítka a do toho i další milion kombinací. Já osobně jsem si např. změnil přehazování itemů na  3+M3 a přeházování zbraní je klasicky M3 (kolečky u myši), takže to byla ukázka.\nZároveň tu je opět i omezený system inventáře. REovsky tak omezený že často nevíte co byste radši vyměnili za ten herb. Ale tady se mi taky naskytl problem který jsem nijak neřešil takže nevím jestli je to dost vzácný problem a nebo to dokonce ani není problem jen jsem nepochopil mechaniky hry, ale občas když jsem otevřel inventář tak se mi nezobrazil kursor. Což je problem protože pak nebylo nijak možné vyhodit věci. (Teda aspoň si to myslím, klávesově jsem to nedokázal, možná byl způsob. Ani já tu hru nemam od A do Z proštudovanou.)\n\nGrafika -\nOpět pokrok od RE5, stále to není tak parádní, ale máme tu nějaké hezké efekty, osvětlení a další věcičky. O grafiku se tolik nezájímám takže to je asi vše k tomu.\n\nMechaniky hry -\nTady bych vytknul jednu věc, sice jednu ale kritickou. Hra si přímo ZAKLÁDÁ na Quick time eventech. Unikni zombie tak že budeš klikat pravé a levé tlačítko myší. Odkopni zombie tak že ve správnou dobu klikneš. Mačkej zběsile R aby si otočil páčkou á však to znáte. Ale tady je to až tak šílené použito ve všem, až je to otravné.\nSkills, po kapitolách naleznete i sběratelské předměty včetně skill pointu. Což trochu zachovává replayabilitě. Sbíráte emblemy abyste si otevřeli dokumenty a "figurky" hrdinů. A taky dáváte dohromady skill pointy abyste si odemkli vylepšení pro samo sebe. Klasika ale pro spoustu lidí zábavná věc.\n\nBonusy -\nVe hře je kromě te 30ti hodinové kampaně dokonce DALŠÍ MOŽNOST. Když nemluvím o placených DLC tak máte i po dohrání kampaně možnost si zahrát Mercenries mod, který teda mě osobně dost baví. Je to klasický Horde mode. Zvolíte mapu, každá má své preset nepřátele, zvolíte charaktera. (A to radši pečlivě, nejen že každý jinak vypadá, ale á i jiný loadout!) Případně si najdete partnera (což doporučuji) a jedete. Drtíte zombíky tak abyste nasbírali, pokud možno s partnerovou pomocí, co největší ba-i maximalni combo. Co je na tom všem ještě lepší je fakt, že abyste odemkli další mapu či charaktera, musíte již odemknuté mapy dát na Rank A-S, což jsou ty dva nejlepší pochopitelně. Takže to je taková malá motivace abyste to zvládli. Protože nová mapa nejen že otvírá nové možnosti ale některé z nich i nové nepřátele.\nA kdyby vás už i Mercenaries nebavili mužete si trochu připlatit za další bonusové mody.\n\n\n~SHRNUTÍ~\nRE6 je jasný pokrok od RE5, stále se drží toho akčníího formátu než toho survival horror. Ale já jsem zastánce obojího takže to pro mě nijak není problem.\n+Grafika\n+Vylepšený aiming system\n+Zábavné levely\n+Klišovitý ale poměrně dobrý děj\n+Délka hrací doby\n+Variace hratelných postav\n+Spoustu zbraní\n+Bonusové mody\n\n-Quick time eventy everywhere\n-Občas špatná odpověď na akce hráče, čili prohrajete ikdyž za to uplně nemužete (opět s tim maji co dočinění QTE)\n-Voice chat je horrible a nedá se vypnout\n-Type chat neexistuje\n-Občasné mizení cursoru v inventáři\n\n7.5/10 - Jako fan RE mě to bavilo, ale pro někoho kdo RE nikdy nehrál a toto bude jeho první zažítek, tak meh, to radši ne. Zkuste RE1 nebo 4, lépe vám to ukáže čeho je RE schopné.","August 11, 2015","true","75.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

But this is not a horror game. There's nothing scary in it. At all. You'd think that would be necessary for a Resident Evil game, but Capcom unwisely disagrees. This doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game most of the time. The plot is the worst nonsense this side of a Jill sandwich, and while it does have some replayability, I find I don't really want to play it again. There's nothing even resembling a puzzle. The music is probably the best in the series, to be honest, but that's not enough to save it.\n\nBut the reason I can't recommend this game is that it has Quick-Time Events. Screw QTE's.

There's at least two sequences where you're moving along a corridor and feel like you're in control.   The character stops when you stop pressing a button.   The trouble is, the camera's locked (try to look around and you can only look in a narrow cone, and the camera snaps back), and you can only move forward (press anything and you just move forward).    It may as well be a fully scripted sequence.    Then, as if quicktime sequences aren't bad enough, there's at least 3 places in the game where they suddently change the camera angle and reverse the controls, so that instead of running away from a creature or explosion, you suddenly run INTO it with little margin for error and no warning about the change over.\n\nThen, the game ends with slightly less than 10 minutes of credits -- which you CAN NOT skip without doing a kill-9 on the game (that's where you use the OS to shutdown a rogue program).

The controls can be clunky and overcomplicated (use a gamepad), quick-time events are always a point of contention, the graphics (while very good) can be a bit underwhelming in spots, the interface is odd and takes time to familiarize yourself with, the story is completely over the top...\n\nBut the way it's all wrapped together just works so well.  It's an immense coop experience.  It's a very long experience by third person shooter standards (roughly 20-25 hours for a complete playthrough of all campaigns) and honestly I loved almost every bit of it.  Heh.  Most of these "flaws" are really just a matter of getting used to change.  This isn't the Resident Evil of old, and convention is regularly defied.  Which isn't always a bad thing, but you'll have to adjust for it.  The tension of tip-toeing and backtracking through a mansion for hours on 10 bullets is replaced with shootouts, explosions and grandeous boss battles.  The "zombies" often have guns.\n\nIf you can manage to appreciate that this is an action game first, and Resident Evil second... go in with an open mind, and more importantly, go in with a friend... you'll have a great time.  The little flaws will be almost endearing in the bigger picture.\n\nIf you can't appreciate that... odds are the issues I mentioned above could ruin it for you.","February 15, 2014","true","64.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","2"

I almost quit the game before I was done with the intro, as I thought that was the actual game. Once I started with Leon's campaign, I re-evaluated the game and actually found myself liking it. It captured the horror/survival game we all know and love about the Resident Evil series.\n\nUnfortunatly Leon's campaign is just 1 out of 4. If you play the campaigns in order, the game gets worse and worse. Chris's campaign takes us away from the horror/survival genre and put us in a bizarre 3rd person shooter game that takes place in East Europe. Still the campaign was okay.\n\nJake's campaign gets even worse. We're still in East Europe, and we spend most of our time running from stuff. With a car, with a motorcycle, with a snowmobile, on a boat and by foot. A lot of the time we are running with a fixed position camera angle, which annoyed the crap out of me.\n\nDear CapCom running away in an intense situation with a fixed camera position doesn't make the game more intresting, it makes it annoying. No one likes it when you run forward using "W key" just to all of a sudden have to use the "A key" in order to run straight forward. If you got  great scenery you wanna show off, find some other way to do it.\n\nThe 4th and final is Ada's campaign. After playing through the first chapter, I really feel I don't want to continue playing this game. Again we find outselves running from everything. We have to stealth and avoid enemies, we have to climb ladders and swim on a timer.\n\nFeel free to throw 100's of brain eating zombies at me. Give me puzzles to solve, make me fight unreasonable big and hard bosses. But don't ask me to stealth and run away from everything. Don't give me mini-cutscenes in the middle of a boss fight. And for the love of God, let me decide from what angle I want the camera!\n\nI'm really sorry to say, but I don't recommend this game. At least not if you like horror/survivor games. I really wish capaign 2, 3 & 4 were more simmilar to the first one. But it seems that CapCom decided to try and please everyone, by making each campaign aimed at different types of players. I'm sorry Capcom, but instead of pleasing a greater audience, you now have people hating 75% of the game. I don't see how it's possible to enjoy all 4 campaigns.\n\nIt's as absurd as if you were to make the next Tomb Raider 25% Tomb Raider, 25% Mario-Kart, 25% Silent Hill and 25% Farmville.

It's a pretty good action game that looks pretty, the controls are FINALLY excellent, it has a solid length to it, the AI is improved (a bit) from RE5, and most of the game can be played in co-op. But this is not a horror game. There's nothing scary in it. At all. You'd think that would be necessary for a Resident Evil game, but Capcom unwisely disagrees. This doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game most of the time. The plot is the worst nonsense this side of a Jill sandwich, and while it does have some replayability, I find I don't really want to play it again. There's nothing even resembling a puzzle. The music is probably the best in the series, to be honest, but that's not enough to save it.\n\nBut the reason I can't recommend this game is that it has Quick-Time Events. Screw QTE's.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awhaleable/recommended/221040/","awhaleable","awhaleable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awhaleable/","627 products in account","I enjoyed RE5. Even though it wasn't the classic RE everyone knew, it was really a mostly good buddy action game with solid mechanics. The campaign was fun, and Mercenaries was also fun.\n\nAlthough this game was also good buddy fun, there are too many flaws to recommend this game normally. And for the 6th game in such a well established series, it's pretty shocking how flawed it is. You should get this game only if:\n\n1. You have a friend to play with whom you can enjoy a good laugh with while playing a really flawed game.\n2. You're paying less than $10.\n\nI played the majority of the game with a friend. Only when I played the last campaign did I come face to face with how bad the game really is.\n\nGood stuff:\n\n1. Movement Controls/Combat mechanics. They're very action oriented and can be really fluid in given situations. Honestly the best showcase for the controls is mercenary mode.\n\n2. Pretty decent looking graphically.\n\n3. Co-op fun for the first 3 campaigns and mercenary mode.\n\nBad Stuff:\n\n1. One of the first things I noticed was the lighting in the game makes absolutely no sense. This was most noticeable in Leon's campaign. The brightness calibration test at the start is HORRIBLY miscalibrated. Both me and my buddy had to increase brightness drastically once we were in the actual game. On top of that, the game seemed absurdley dark. The light sources in the game seemed to give off no light on the surrounding environment. It looks really bad, but this is most noticeable in Leon's campaign.\n\n2. Cover mechanics suck, despite so many other cover based shooters having existed by the time this game came out.\n\n3. QTEs. See now, I don't hate all QTEs. I like "context sensitive" ones. Pressing RT when an enemy is stunned activates a special move. This kind of QTE is fine to me. I hate the "fill the meter to not die" and "press a random button you have no way of knowing before seeing it" kind. There are a lot of those.\n\n4. The camera can be pretty bad, sometimes it's way too close to your character and they occupy way too much screen space. Similarly, this game has running sections where the camera orients itself classic RE style, from a set angle which you can't anticipate. This will often be the cause of many unjustified deaths.\n\n5. The plot is pretty whatever, RE isn't really known for having a brilliant plot, despite taking itself so seriously.\n\n6. A lot of things that happen seem to make absolutely NO sense, plot-wise AND gameplay-wise. I noticed this mostly in Ada's campaign (which I'm still playing through). There are puzzles you encounter that only make sense within the context of a video game, they have no logic to them. There was a puzzle where I needed an emblem. I walked into a room and a zombie pulls a lever which drops the big chest with the emblem through a trap door. Was he waiting here the whole time to do this? Why is he sentient enough to do this and how does he know my intentions? I killed him and I clearly needed to hold the lever down somehow so i could go through the trap door.\n\nSo how did I do this? There are bodies hanging from the ceiling from nooses with locks on them. You're supposed to move the lever (which is on a track) near one of the bodies, shoot the lock which causes the body to drop from the noose (how?), the body gets caught on the lever and holds it down. If you shoot the body without landing on the lever, it dissolves and another one drops from the ceiling. ...WHAT. The whole premise of the puzzle makes no sense at all. There are many more like this. I can't even chalk this up to video game logic because there is no logic to this at all.\n\n7. Ada's campaign being single player oriented. I appreciate they tried to do something different by making it a single player campaign, but it's executed in the worst way possible. You play 3 campaigns co-op. The 4th campaign can still be played co-op, but the story and gameplay is built around one player. Only Ada can interact with puzzles and exist in cutscenes. The most the second player can do is fight zombies, but there aren't nearly as many because it's built around one person playing. It really dissuades you from playing with a friend because they end up being useless, thus taking pretty much the only entertaining factor of the game away.\n\nSo yeah the game is fun with a friend, but not worth it otherwise. RE5 was a better game.","April 30","false","29.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It's the worst between RE4, 5, and 6 when RE became an action series. I strongly recommend getting drunk and playing the campaign with a friends. That is... if you have any friends. Lucky for me I'm not a basement dwelling loser. I marathoned the campaign with a buddy, and it was fantastic.\n\nThe story garbage, but it's so bad it's good. Don't take it seriously. It's a campy, action B-movie. But the campagin is terrible for replays. It's chocked full of QTEs, cutscenes, and gameplay interruptions. RE5 gave you huge sessions of gameplay with a few cutscenes in between. This dials everything up to 11. They even patched it so you don't have to do QTEs anymore. I'm not joking.\n\nI can't even jump into a random co-op campaign because of all those issues. It's just so boring. It's too bad because the gameplay mechanics are the absolute best in the series. So I strongly recommend Mercenaries and checking out its other game modes.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game best played with a friend so it's easily worth $10 or $20.\n\nHAMMER THE BUTTONS AND WIGGLE THE STICKS/10\n\n(Look it up on YouTube)","March 18, 2015","true","212.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","6","13","5","0"

If one has to say it isn't a resident evil game anymore; I would say that the series really hasn't been "Resident Evil"  since code veronica or the first 3. It kind of got the hitman absolution treatment. Also going back to the city is wonderful since RE has been on this rural muddy/washed out colored binge for a couple games. They finally made a dark game again.. The addition of other game modes and mercenaries is also pretty awesome.\n\nIt remains linear though like 4-revelations which is my  small nitpick since I love to splore in games.\nThe only thing that bums me out is the (so-far) lack of weapon upgrade parts. The QTE's are actually pretty nice and short compared to other games where you can be asked to spam a key super fast for 30 sec.\nI would easily give this an 7.5 to 8/10 if asked but to me I am fully satisfied and would really only want more re6. :P\n\n\nMore info:\n\nI have been a fan of the RE series since playing/owning the first three at release on the ps1. I stepped away after code veronica and never cared to return since what I saw of four looked way too different from the RE games I knew and loved.\n\nOnly recently I have gotten into the later games 4,5, revelations and now six.\nI would argue that they finally got rid of all the clunky mechanics that were only around because of the controllers and limits back then. While I love the old ones the best this one feels top notch gameplay wise out of the recent titles.\nFor instance the pause and shoot was from 1-veronica since you could not free aim and had to tap on the up down to shoot high or low. They kept it in 5 to be a throwback and somehow make it hard or something.\n\nIn Resident Evil 6 you can finally dodge and melee proper, though it will tire you and have a short cd. (non-spammy).\nThe gun play feels good and the sound effects are really nice. Being able to roll out of the way or land on your back to shoot from the floor is a great touch.  Graphically the game is beautiful and benefits greatly from Sweetfx.\n\nIn my opinion RE6 feels like what 4-revelations should have been controls wise. Those clung on to old mechanics to make you think they were staying true to the old play style. In 6 they shed all that, made the mechanics/controls more fluid/responsive and finally let it be a decent TPS instead of a slow clunky one.\nThis title takes you back to the city and the shambler type zombies come with that. You will find that sometimes it is better to run than it is to keep fighting. I wish we could have RE 1-veronica playstyle back but since that is gone, six is a good entry to the series.","July 21, 2014","true","75.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Even the interactive (tap A) or swirl your thumbstick is a pain in the ♥♥♥ cause sometimes it goes faster than even possible. The tactics originally in this game were around the fact of playing smart, scavenging for ammo and conserving it properly by shooting out their kneecaps and using physical force as everyone knows. Now don't get me wrong the melee combat is much better in this, they give u way to much ammo. it is literally just pull out your pistols, shoot a ton and keep going.

I only say it's the second worst, because nothing to this day has managaed to outdo the horrible asthetic that is RE5.\n\nI'm a huge Resident Evil fan. Look at my Steam URL. I've kept this handle since 2005. I'm a fan of the classic RE games, and RE4 is a great game. Please, listen to me on this. They have ruined the story for good with RE6, and have done too many things that will be hard to undo. If undone in any way, they will just make this wound worse than it was than was after the events happened.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the controls handle outstandingly well. That's the surprising part. For a game that has managed to mangle a fictional universe so thoroughly, just diving around and shooting is really fun to execute. The co-op has great netcode from my own experience, and the idea of hunting agents that are playing portions of the game is fantastic in concept. I give Capcom props to the attempt at the latter mention, but can't recommend this game in the end.\n\nI can only suggest maybe buying it at a significantly cheaper price than the usual full price. Say, maybe ten dollars or less? If you have a PS3 or Xbox 360, it's also just cheaper on there in the Capcom Essentials collection which comes with four other games. That costs labout $20 for its current price. Do yourself a favor and pick that up instead, and you'll get Dead Rising too as an added bonus.","August 10, 2014","false","36.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Apart from the stunning graphics, one thing I like in particular is the smooth and blending combat in this game. The controls have been Taylored ( ;) ) to perfection. Length of the story modes also sort of satisfied me. Unfortunately it did feel like the same story was being played over and over again. But then again, that was the whole idea. This point may or may not be liked by a few people so, look out if you're not into such stuff.\n\nA previous knowledge into the RE series is, thankfully, NOT required to understand this game much. I, for one, am a huge RE fan but to be honest my memory resembles that of an elephant (or an ant, whichever has a weaker one) and I forget things. I don't really recall what happened in the last games even though I've played them a lot of times. Even watched all of the movies (both real and animated ones). However, if one truly wants to indulge complete with the story and the background, try quickly using wikipedia and speed reading some of it. Helps if you want to dive in deep.\n\nI played this game alone but it does have the option to play it with one more player/friend.

I got it on sale for $7.50 and it's worth about that much. It's competent enough to function while being bad enough to laugh at.\n\nAs a Resident Evil game, though, it's TERRIBLE and because it's actually SUPPOSED to be a Resident Evil game, it deserves the negative review. The last great RE game, IMO and not counting remakes, was RE4. This game takes everything good about the older RE games and throws it out the window while taking all the bad stuff and amplifies it 100 fold. It also throws in all the garbage gaming conventions that modern AAA devs think games need that drive me crazy like QTEs, excessive cutscenes, QTEs, taking control away from the player in the middle of gameplay segments, QTEs, gamey button prompts that ruin immersion, have I mentioned QTEs?\n\nLet me compare the beginning of this game to a great RE game like RE2. In RE2 you had an FMV cutscene (with zero QTEs) followed by a wonderful gameplay intro that was so memorable I could paint a picture of each scene from memory. Between the end of the FMV cutscene and finding the police station, there was only one short cutscene that used the in-game engine at a gun shop. Aside from that short cutscene it was all normal gameplay allowing the player to get used to the game and immerse themself in the world. In RE6 you're being shot at by a helicopter right off the bat, but wait, you have to open the options menu because you're dropped into the game without a main menu. The heli shoots constantly without hitting anything while you mess with settings, a real immersion killer. Then you have to drag Helena away from the heli but you don't press the movement keys to do so, you mash the spacebar for a garbage QTE. Then you're in an alley for an on-rails segment where any direction you press has Leon lumber forward. Up/down/left/right all progress him down this rail. The player has extremely limited control. In the next part you're finally free to walk around but that's it. You can't check the weapon controls or even run. You can only walk. Then the game expects you to learn the weapon controls in 0.25 seconds as they throw a zombie at your face and flash QTE style prompts on the screen (although this isn't a QTE, it just has the immersion-destroying prompts as a kind of tutorial). Failing to shoot the zombie because you weren't simply allowed to play with your gun to get used to it before the zombie shows up, you die and go back to a checkpoint. As the tutorial segment continues you jump over cars as part of a QTE, you fly a helicopter as part of a QTE, you run from an explosion as part of a QTE, you shoot zombies as part of a QTE, etc... It's all very exciting gameplay... NOT. Devs, how about you let ME play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game?\n\nThe co-op is generic, as I said. In a Resident Evil game I expect to poke around, click on environmental stuff to read little descriptions of things, pick up files, search for ammo/herbs, solve puzzles, etc. Aside from picking up the odd ammo/herb none of that is present. Also, 90% of your items come from enemy drops so searching for environmental pickups isn't even that important. It's streamlined for co-op, in other words. Devs these days seem to think that a co-op experience has to be FAST to be playable. Can't stop to read descriptions! Can't stop to admire the scenery! Can't stop to solve puzzles! Gotta blaze through the game ASAP! You want a puzzle? How about Player A helps Player B access a co-op accessible area, and then Player B presses a button/unlocks a door/pushes a box/etc to allow Player A to follow? Great puzzle, right? There are also dual pickups meaning both players can pick up each item once meaning there's no real communication aside from "ammo/herb over here". You won't have to discuss how much ammo/herbs of each type each player has and who should get what.\n\nI could go on. There are many factors that make this a terrible RE game or just a sub-par generic co-op game but we'd be here all day. Overall, the game is playable. If you're playing with a friend, it's actually not bad to play through and laugh at the problems the game has so if that sounds like something you'd enjoy, I can honestly recommend picking it up on sale. For the many reasons stated, however, I feel this game falls way, way, way short of it's potential and isn't a fitting entry in the RE franchise and that's where the negative review comes from.\n\nFinal Edit: Finished the main campaign and while I have a number of new complaints, the one that really needs to be added here is the dynamic difficulty. In other games that have dynamic difficulty, after you die at the same spot a few times the game might get a little easier to help you get past that part. Here, though, you die once and it  switches to Baby Mode. You'll never die in the same place twice (unless it's due to some janky QTE). Not only is this very insulting to the player but it's also a huge flaw in game design philosphy to think that nothing in the game should take more than 2 attempts.","November 8, 2015","false","13.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you love a mix of Horror and Action, then this is a must have. Mercenaries Mode and the Campaign are very fun! Pros: Very nicely done graphics, Very well done and interesting story, Nice characters, Fun Gameplay. Cons: I just wish there were more scary parts, the cover system isn"t the best, Capcom could have cut down on the QTE events(That one is a minor complaint by me though but a lot of the people complain about that, but it doesnt really ruin the game experience for me.). New players trying to get into the series will really like this one. It may upset older gamers who have played past titles but if you look at this game and just dont think about the flaws so much and just enjoy what Resident Evil 6 has to offer you will have a expierience playing this one :) I think this one is very under rated.

It is in NO WAY like Resident Evil 1-3, if you're playing just for the scares, look somewhere else. If not, it's definitely worth your money. The next few sections talk about the campaigns you get to play, Leon's, Chris's, Jake's and Ada's. All spoiler free.\n\nOne of the best things about Leons campaign is the atmosphere, you'll find you are constantly moving between stunning burning cities and creepy cemeteries all in the dead of night. Personally, I really enjoyed Leon's story, even though the dialogue can be a little cliche sometimes, Leon and Helena are both interesting characters and you'll like watching the cutscenes. Sadly, this is the only campaign where you'll face actually zombies, so enjoy that while it lasts.\n\nChris's campaign has to be the worst, it feels like a poor, out of place action game than anything else. Mainly because you don't fight ANY zombies, but creatures called J'avo, which are basically smart zombies that have guns and shoot at you, which isn't great considering the cover mechanics are terrible. You'll also find you run out of ammo fast as you don't get a pistol, but an assault rifle as your primary weapon, and meleeing against enemies who are shooting you is not fun, to top that off, Piers (player 2 in Chris's campaign) doesn't get the survival knife that Chris has, so as you're failing to melee with your sniper rifle while the enemies pound you with bullets, you can take time thinking about why the BSAA doesn't give all it's soldiers the same equipment. As for the characters themselves, Piers is a boring stereotypical soldier with every bad action movie line and will soon annoy you and make you cringe, maybe this was why the BSAA thought he wasn't worth giving a survival knife to. Chris is just OK as he actually has some character development mainly building off his experiences from RE5.\n\nJakes campaign is very good despite you're only fighting the J'avo, his storyline is incredibly interesting and what makes it stand out from Chris's is the characters, Jake and Sherry's chemistry I found brilliant watch and that alone makes this campaign great. The only negative I found on this campaign is a ridiculously unrealistic action scene from Chapter 4. That being said I think Jakes tied with Leons for best campaign, even though they play completely differently.\n\nAda's campaign is less about shooting enemies and more about wrapping up loose ends from the other 3 stories. Even though Capcom released an update so you didn't have to unlock her campaign by beating the other 3, I would still recommend you save her campaign until last, otherwise you won't get the full benefit from the story. There's a good amount of stealth involved, which is very difficult to pull off on your first attempt so it doesn't really feel like an achievement when you finally manage it, but it does offer some good puzzle solving scenarios, all of which are quite difficult and very satisfying when you figure them out. Also the chemistry between her and Leon is built on from the events of RE4, and as a result produces some gripping scenes.\n\nOverall it's a very good game, and definitely does not feel like a traditional Resident Evil game (which is the reason for majority of the poor reviews the game received). Bear in mind the graphics are amazing, the story is just excellent and game goes as low as £4.99 on a flash sale. This game is well worth picking up.","August 17, 2014","true","143.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The gameplay itself has turned into the same old copy paste genre of action we all see today, cover based, run and gun, this (i feel) has no place in a resident evil game what .. So ... ever. The series has always relied on the fear of the unknown to suck us into the story, and the last game in my opinion to do that was resident evil 4. This game had the potential to redeem the actions of Capcom after number 5; pretty much pushed its luck. although the game was an ok follow up from number 4 since 5 explained it in a sense that a person with a properly functioning brain could figure out the gaps between, it still very much started to slip into the mainstream to try and get some more attention, which Ultimately caused the series to delve into the realm of shoot'em'ups, which led to the unwanted drunken one night stand baby Resident evil 6. So all and all Not great but not good either, I will be fair, it has its moments which did scare me only a little, and at times it was fun, but to be honest it’s hard to return to what came before 5, More to the point that proves my whole review has some truth to it, Number 6 has caused Capcom to "Reboot" the franchise, which is such a shame, it had potential to continue strong. if only it wasn't for this cancer of ♥♥♥♥ mainstream garbage like "call of duty" and other copy paste titles that 12 year olds and boys oh so much; Resident evil 6 might have survived, but like most games these days, it now takes its place at the bottom of the awful games ocean where all the bottom feeders dwell in it. Although it’s still better than this - http://www.getyfree.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Download-Resident-Evil-Operation-Raccoon-City-game-full-PC.jpg - But Yea to conclude.

It takes multiple head shots to kill a zombie now, kicks are more effective but that requires you to get up close.  If you see a zombie laying on the ground you can't shoot it, you have to walk up to it and wait for it to jump you before you can do anything about it.  Those annoying mini games where you have to push the right button at the right time are everywhere, even for something as simple as turning an ignition key or pushing a zombie off you and that zombie only managed to get on top of you because when you emptied your clip into its face while it was sitting in a chair it did nothing so you had to walk up to it and let it attack you.  The controls are terrible and counter intuitive but I guess that's pretty much how all the resident evils have been.  Other than the graphics I can't think of a single thing I liked about this game.","May 8, 2014","false","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is in NO WAY like Resident Evil 1-3, if you're playing just for the scares, look somewhere else. If not, it's definitely worth your money. The next few sections talk about the campaigns you get to play, Leon's, Chris's, Jake's and Ada's. All spoiler free.\n\nOne of the best things about Leons campaign is the atmosphere, you'll find you are constantly moving between stunning burning cities and creepy cemeteries all in the dead of night. Personally, I really enjoyed Leon's story, even though the dialogue can be a little cliche sometimes, Leon and Helena are both interesting characters and you'll like watching the cutscenes. Sadly, this is the only campaign where you'll face actually zombies, so enjoy that while it lasts.\n\nChris's campaign has to be the worst, it feels like a poor, out of place action game than anything else. Mainly because you don't fight ANY zombies, but creatures called J'avo, which are basically smart zombies that have guns and shoot at you, which isn't great considering the cover mechanics are terrible. You'll also find you run out of ammo fast as you don't get a pistol, but an assault rifle as your primary weapon, and meleeing against enemies who are shooting you is not fun, to top that off, Piers (player 2 in Chris's campaign) doesn't get the survival knife that Chris has, so as you're failing to melee with your sniper rifle while the enemies pound you with bullets, you can take time thinking about why the BSAA doesn't give all it's soldiers the same equipment. As for the characters themselves, Piers is a boring stereotypical soldier with every bad action movie line and will soon annoy you and make you cringe, maybe this was why the BSAA thought he wasn't worth giving a survival knife to. Chris is just OK as he actually has some character development mainly building off his experiences from RE5.\n\nJakes campaign is very good despite you're only fighting the J'avo, his storyline is incredibly interesting and what makes it stand out from Chris's is the characters, Jake and Sherry's chemistry I found brilliant watch and that alone makes this campaign great. The only negative I found on this campaign is a ridiculously unrealistic action scene from Chapter 4. That being said I think Jakes tied with Leons for best campaign, even though they play completely differently.\n\nAda's campaign is less about shooting enemies and more about wrapping up loose ends from the other 3 stories. Even though Capcom released an update so you didn't have to unlock her campaign by beating the other 3, I would still recommend you save her campaign until last, otherwise you won't get the full benefit from the story. There's a good amount of stealth involved, which is very difficult to pull off on your first attempt so it doesn't really feel like an achievement when you finally manage it, but it does offer some good puzzle solving scenarios, all of which are quite difficult and very satisfying when you figure them out. Also the chemistry between her and Leon is built on from the events of RE4, and as a result produces some gripping scenes.\n\nOverall it's a very good game, and definitely does not feel like a traditional Resident Evil game (which is the reason for majority of the poor reviews the game received). Bear in mind the graphics are amazing, the story is just excellent and game goes as low as £4.99 on a flash sale. This game is well worth picking up.","August 17, 2014","true","143.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Well...no not really on several occasions there were times when trying to join a co-op session cause the game to lag horribly unless the creator quits and restarts the lobby. And alt tabbing would inexplicably cause the framerate to lag without and indication of going back to normal.\n\nOk so whats wrong with the game? Everything. A barage of bullet sponge enemies acompanied with 30 second moments of action inbetween pointless cutscenes only to immediately lead into another part of the story making me wonder why the game included it as gameplay rather than just an entire cutscene. (seriously the chapters felt about as shattered as Lost Planet 2) The camera and controls were pretty pathetic, taking the gameplay many steps back instead of progressing into something refreshing. Not to mention something simple like rebinding sidemouse buttons won't work as the game doesn't even recognize them. You'll often be thrown to the ground or flung about being disorientated forcing you to trudge through parts of the game. Which would be fun if the gunplay didnt feel like shooting scarecrows. You can't be tactical or skillful in encounters. Headshots are a hit and miss for either killing the enemy or just triggering a transformation. Thus your best bet is to either unload as many clips as possible and hope you can tell when theyre dead (a health bar honestly wouldve done wonders for this game) or try to incapacitate with a single shot and use melee (which you are limited on and eventually get slowed down if you run out of stamina) and just hope the enemy doesnt land a cheap shot before youre able to thus flinging you about some more...becoming incapacitated yet again and....do you see the pattern yet?\n\nLets not forget the muddled story. Breaking it off into 4 segments wouldve been nice if it wasnt filled with the same chore missions/enemies throughout several campaigns instead of being done and over with it and if they had made SOME effort to bring any suspense to the story at all. 0 build up. Get guns, shoot things. Thats it, theres some garbage character development love story in one of the campaigns and nonsense drama (you killed my dad i dunno how to deal with that ok im better now we're friends lets save the world) (uhoh my evil clone is doing ♥♥♥♥ better not let anyone in on that so they all want to kill me because im mysterious and cant break character by using my ♥♥♥♥ING brain)\n\nLets not forget that the graphics have gone NOWHERE.

Youre left romping about an ugly world (not for the sake of atmosphere, it looks more like lack of effort) with poor contrast and an overall muddy template.\n\nLast but not least Id like to mention that playing number 2 to ada wong in the 4th campaign had me feeling more useless than watching someone else play solo. You magically teleport when she grapples, you cant pick anything up, you can't open doors or interact with anything, and you start with less weapons.

This game has a intresting story that expands the more you play, Leon's story has some good scares in it and Jake's story will be right at home to people who have played resident evil 3. Chris's story on the otherhand is more in line with resident evil 5 and for some people this can be a good thing or a bad thing and i have yet to play it so i wont talk about it that much. There are several multiplayer and single player modes one such mode lets other people join you're single player/co-op as a zombie which makes the game harder. People complain that there is not enough ammo in the game and that this is a bad thing but in reality they are complaing about something that has been in the RE series from the start the lack of ammo makes the game feel more like a horror game then a action game and there is the melee combat which is done well mixing up gunplay and melee is you're best bet to survive even in co-op.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020482980/recommended/221040/","76561198020482980","ℬ☺ℓттℯ","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020482980/","132 products in account","Nice game - never played a Resident Evil (RE) game before and this is my first I lied, I just remembered I played a bit of Revelations(just the very beginning of it) on the 3DS XL, but didn't like how it was played with the analogue and keypad to aim and shoot(it felt awkward) and stuff so I sold that game and wait till I get get PC version of it and play that instead. I've watched the RE movies though, all of them. They were cool! I am awaiting for the next sequel movie!\n\nLong story short, Biohazard is the Japanese name for it over there and Resident Evil is the name that was chosen for the Americans in case people are wondering why there are two titles. When I first saw this, I though "Oooh, do I get another free bonus game with RE 6 as well?" And of course didn't find it (when I launched the game)and did some googling and yeah that's what it was...\n\nOk, I don't know much history about the story of the RE game(So I'll have to play RE 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to get the connections and story going, the game did mention Raccoon City and I think that's a game itself or could be apart of one of those numbers - so I'll need to play that sometime as well), and the movies I watched were from a few years ago too so if anything from the movies did have some sort of connection to the games, then I don't know/remember of. So I guess I'll start where RE 6 starts off at.\n\nThere's zombie apacalypse going on, thanks to the new weapons man has design to *supposedly* take care of terrism and such. You start off with Leon and Helena (I think I spelt her name correctly). Helena got badly wounded and it's up to Leon to find something to fix that up. After that little scenario, you are brought to the main menu of the game, which is interesting as games usually bring you the main menu first before giving you a taste of the the game itself. When I first started, I thought I had to maybe complete the game before I could go to the menu and save and to not be able to take breaks. Hah.\n\nWell anyways, from there you can do some configurations and stuff and then play the campaigns. There are four campaigns, Leon, Chris, Jake and Ada. You will want to play through all of them to see what RE 6 has got to offer as a whole, just by playing one of the campaigns won't be enough as it'll feel too short. Even though there's four campaigns, they are not a sequel to one another but as played in their respective character's eyes of how they saw it. So if you've played it once through with Leon, that's pretty much it, or at least how it went with him. About six hours worth of gameplay. When playing Chris' campaign, you play it at exactly same time period but in Chris' eyes and how it happened for him, same with Jake and Ada's. So the four people will meet at one point or another during each other's campaign. So with that, an average gamer would play a day's worth of RE 6 if he were to play non-stop.\n\nIn each of the four campaigns, you can play as one of the two characters, amking it a two player only coop or solo with a bot. In Leon, it's Leon and Helena, in Chris' it's Chris and Pierce, in jake's, it's Jake and Sherry(Or it could be spelt with a C) and apparently in Ada, it's Ada and some agent(otherwise you solo the entire game yourself with no help because when I did, there was no agent bot to help out). I found the gameplay enjoyable, save for those fustration puzzle(it's always that moment after you google the solution or a hint/tip and find out "Wow....I'm so blind and dumb, how could I not see that??!" - I've only done it once by the way and that was for Ada's campaign...) moments and boss moments where you're like (after using up all your bullets of every weapon you have) "How the hell do I take this guy down??!" hahaha\n\nThe controls were customizable(well some of them at least) so that's nice to know, though I was fine with the default values anyways. The grahics were nice too, though it appears to be capped at 120fps....despite my 144Hz monitor and display refresh rate was also set to 144 as well ingame. I also notice quite a bit of screen tearing(especially near the end of Jake's campaign) which shouldn't be happening because I am running on a higher refresh rate than the fps it was pumping out, so unless fraps was reporting an incorrect fps value, maybe I was going over 144fps whilst gaming? Though having V-Sync enabled appears to fix that, though I've already solo'd the entire game, all four campaigns with V-sync off(though I wanted it off as it would increas input lag which is a fact and it was already capped to 120 and my refresh rate is set to 144 anyways - so I suppose capping fps isn't really an alternative to fix screen tearing whilst also avoiding increased input lag)....but it still didn't bring to counter to 144 which is what it's supposed to sync to...must be internal engine fps limit or something...\n\nAudio appears to be stereo only, though a game like this, I reckon it would have benefit with a surround sound option....you know, zombies/enemies coming from the behind, or your sides....Voice overs were nice too and felt right as well.\n\nYeah...oh yeah, you can also join-mid game too so you don't have to wait till they finish a chapter or a checkpoint. I had a few randoms join mine when I was soloing the game. Some of the addons you can't even solo which is shame because I wanted too to play them, so you'll need to get a group together and do that. Um yeah...I liked it so thumbs up from me!\n\nSome of the game parts are really really dark, espcially the Leon campaign so you'll want to play on a monitor that has excellent contrast or else you'll need to either turn down brightness/gamma(ingame or in your graphics control panel - or both) to the point where Black is Black and not Grey, but foregoing brightness when needed for the bright areas which will look darker and dull and not so wow factor or just put up with your crappy monitor and see Grey instead of nice deep Blacks that you're supposed to see. It's these things like this that break immersion....and unfortunately you can't buy CRTs anymore.....and they have superior contrast to the LCDs I'm using...\n\n=====================================================\nPlayed on "The Beast"\ni7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

I like the Co-op mode it has, you can join other players campaign while they are in-game without starting from a checkpoint, not like RE5 (I loved that RE though don't get me wrong), and also it shows you the time the player have been playing it, which difficulty was set it on, if Infinite Ammo was set it on (which I don't see the point of playing it with that option activated), if friendly fire was activated or not, etc.\nIf you expect to find a Survival Horror atmosphere, well I'm sorry to tell you that you won't find it, RE stopped being Survival Horror since RE4 (where a lot of "fans" started from there it seems). There is an excelent mode called "Agent Hunt" where you can join other players campaign as a zombie, it's a very fun mode in my opinion, and it's even more awesome when you have the right abilities.\nLet's not forget the free DLC it has, where you can play The Mercenaries mode with L4D2 characters!","June 15, 2014","true","261.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you look at it as a Resident Evil installment, then it is actually pretty bad.  It's about as far as you can get from the horror-survival roots that Resident Evil is known for.  It is by far more of an action oriented game at this point.  However, if you look at it as an action shooter, then it's really not that bad.  The controls can be awkward at times, especially with melee attacks and the camera can cause a lot of problem in certain areas, but beyond that, I have no real complaints.\n\nThe co-op is what drew me in and kept me in.  Without the co-op, I doubt I would have put as much into the game as what I did.\n\nIt's not a great game.  It's not a bad game.

I don't like RE 4 and 5 because I think they are uninteresting and when I bought RE 6 I was gambling my money because I have been disappointed with RE 4 and 5.\n\nTurned out my gamble paid very well. I found RE 6 as one of the best game I ever played and probably the best resident evil game to date. The game itself improved the system from 4 and 5. However, the best part of this game is the storytelling and how it is presented. When I played this game I felt like immersing into a non-stop action movie and felt myself as the protagonist.\n\nStrong characters are the main selling point of RE 6. I am captivated with the relationship among the characters. I found RE 4 had less unlikable cast such as Ashley, and in RE 5, Sheva was a nice character but she had less dynamics compared to Piers.\n\nI put this game on the top of my list and as good as Mass Effect 3 and Deus EX Human Reolution. This game makes everyone a hero.  Ignore all the harsh critics, and give this game a chance. I honestly cannot believe all the critics that said this game is worst game ever. Seriously guys, you need your brain checked.

The only thing i was particularly annoyed with in this game is that take time to kill every enemy in some parts you will inevetably waste ammo. for example after the part with the church in leons campaign you are brought to an underground research lab where you have to activate several switches in order to get to a door on the other side of the room which in turn required you to sometimes end your partner out on there own to activate things for you to cross. which in all honesty wasnt bad at all and was really fun. but what bothered me about it is the endless spawning C virus zombies. nothing special about them just your ordinary garden variety zombie that cant do anything unless you of course decide to walk to close or take in the scenery for too long. but still i didnt know that they would endlessly spawn so i sorta started popping heads hoping to clear the room. it didnt work so i had to restart the checkpoint to get my ammo back. some parts of the game you have to just quick shot a few times and then move or else you will get overwhelmed. which makes sense in any case. but to somone who does not know survival horror games it would be a big trap. even so it wasnt that bad at all and i managed to farm quite the ammount of skill points from it. other than that the game is excellent.","July 5, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, RE6 is made up of almost entirely QTE's and cutscenes. No seriously, I have never played a game with more QTE's than this game right here. Also, let's talk about headshots. RE6 get's rid of them in favor of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t skillpoint system that essentially forces you to play each campaign multiple times in order to make your character not suck. I've heard the argument that if headshots did what they used to, the game would be too easy.

Its amazingly frustrating how annoying it is to see how bad this game sucks and how all the bad reviews about were right. I'm afraid I made the worst purchase of this year getting this game. Wouldnt recommended at all. It annoys me even more as I was really excited about playing it thinking it would be like RE4.","July 4, 2014","false","20.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Definitely not recommended.","July 9, 2014","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It actually feels and plays more like a Resident Evil game. I honestly don't know why people mindlessly praise 5 but reject this one. At least be consistent. This game is nowhere as good as the classic Resident Evils but I think for the "modern" nonsense we had to suffer through this game does a lot of things decently.\n\nI think people were just fed up with Capcom in general and Resident Evil continuing to reject its roots so they rebelled against this title instead of 5.\n\n4 was a breath of fresh air (controls mainly), 5 was 4's decayed and infected breath, 6 is the rebirth of 4's formula while cleansing 5's problems. Confused? Yeah, just play the Resident Evil remake instead, can't go wrong there.","March 20, 2015","true","49.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Of course there is no more horror now, but what we have instead is a pretty cool action game with fun and somewhat addicting gameplay, interesting storyline, though too many QTE spoil the game and graphics could be a little bit better. Anyway i would recommend this game to anyone, especially if you are not familiar with RE series.","April 3, 2013","true","309.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Mногие критикуют игру за то, что в игре 3 кампании, что "Capcom сделала из серии тупой шутер без сюжета, умудрилась утратить атмосферу и погружение в мир" - всё это полная чушь.\n\n- Если вы любитель Resident Evil 2,3,4 части как например я, то вам следует проходить всего одну кампанию в игре, это за Леона, эта кампания ближе подходит к мрачной атмосфере, хардкору, хоррору, как в первых частях серии, там и зомби нормальные, и патронов мало.\n- Если вы любитель Resident Evil 5, то вам следует проходить кампанию за Криса, больше экшона и меньше хардкора.\n- А если вам нравятся все части, то следует проходить все кампании, уж поверьте, вы не будете разочарованы.\nCapcom просто решила угодить всем фанатам серии RE, и сделала каждую кампанию не похожей друг на друга, каждая кампания проходится около 6 часов, и придётся по вкусу фанатам серии и даже тем, кто не знаком с серией.","October 23, 2013","true","980.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"
