If like myself you enjoyed the original then this holds plenty of promise with the focus on community created content. Fairly barebones right now, a few Gauntlets created by the Dev, two of which are variants on the free Gauntlet DLC for the original game.\n\nTo address the elephant in the room: Yes, this is at the core a map editor. Even in this basic state though it seems like a fairly in depth one. If you enjoyed the original game and have a creative streak this will likely be worth your time.\n\nVisually and mechanically the game remains the same as the original, though so far the ability to level your squad is missing. Hopefully that will be added at a later date, either persistent or during each level. The ability to share and download another players idea of hell is something I look forward to.\n\nTL:DR - If you liked Survivor Squad, its a good bet you'll like this too. If you didn't then wait a while longer to see what comes in future updates.","November 14, 2014","true","9.1"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","31","42","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmorph/recommended/331720/","nightmorph","NightMorph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmorph/","489 products in account","-Recommended Title-\nSurvivor Squad: Gaunlets is a top down, zombie horde survival game, with various "gauntlets" (challenges/missions) to complete. At the conclusion of each Gauntlet, you'll get a chance to view details of the gauntlet, edit it to see how it works, and comment on the gauntlet, before moving onto the next one. There are many community made gauntlets that are available for Survivor Squad, extending replayability and also difficulty. I really like the graphics, simple and clean, sort of cartoonesque. The sounds are good, and do add to the ambiance. Gameplay wise, it has simple controls (Mostly RMB) and a fog (well black sections of the map) which "unfog" as the survivors move about (or their view changes)- so you do get lots of "surprises"! Line of sight is very important! It is a challenging game, and lots of fun. For me, it's a new spin on the zombie survival games of today. With only two hours on the clock, I haven't yet seen all this game has to offer, but right off the bat, I'd recommended it as a good title to add to your library. If your a modder, maybe the gauntlets could give you, your next editing experience?\n\nGood title for the younger and older gamers out there.\n\nNow, wheres that flamethrower, I hear a horde is headed this way, Bbq time has come! Anyone want fries with those crispy zombies? mwahahaha\n\nGame Score: 8.0","May 29, 2015","true","2.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","16","23","4","0"

Along the way you'll have to deal with the occasional mad scientist, crazy cannibalistic flesh eating zombies and special infected. Go me!\n\nGameplay: Good\nSo to start with you begin the level with 4 guys armed with nothing more than a pistol to get to the landing pad, Along the way you'll encounter enemies in large numbers swarming to eat your brains although currently the ability to die and heal is not as of yet implemented therefor unless a special manages to grab all 4 of your character you can proceed with the mission in impunity.\n\nThere are containers that contains gadgets and weapons that you can find if your team searched them which range from semi auto rifles to full auto ones. Which is really needed since while you cant die [for now] the enemy endlessly pour from in certain section making a faster firing weapon a mandatory thing.\n\nAlso in your escape maps called Gauntlets by the way you will encounter modifier within the map such as survival sequences, unlock the door and strangely enough even a puzzle section if you will which makes the game rather adaptable.\n\nEnemies comes in thick and fast in many forms but like in most zombies game they also come in special variety that blinds, smokes, acidify and blow up in the face of your character but as of for now they are mere annoyance rather than actual threat.\n\nYou can also specify their viewpoint and tell them to fire that and only in that direction which is needed like 50% of the time but occasionally they still ignore your orders, early access after all.\n\nEssentially it all boils down to get to the chopper game with extra mechanic and story throws in.\n\nSound\nNo soothing music here, its all zombie groaning and dying to serve as the background noises although in my opinion thats not really needed for a game such as this, the tension of not dying serves as a good enough distraction.\n\nGraphics\nThe sprites look good enough although if there is one complain is that the character portrait could use an upgraded look to it.\n\nConclusion\nIf you are a fan of the original then pick this one up as well seeing as it has less bugs and now it has WORKSHOP support therefor there are already a lot of fan made maps on the map list. For the others on the fence if you dont fancy early access review then you could always wait for the full release.\n\n\nEarly Access Hiccups as of the review posted date:\nIncorrect button mapping.\nCharacter clipping into the map boundary.\nDisappearing item.\nIts E to use gadgets btw not F for now. The Dev ripped the button placement straight from the old game as placeholder.\n\nVerdict: Good\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups. Win free games, make new friends on Steam, & more!

The gameplay stays true to the original where you have four controllable characters and the aim is to survive by crafting, killing and ultimately staying alive.\nThe newest standout feature is the ability to create, play and upload your own Gauntlets/Maps. The map creator is somewhat easy to use and not overly time consuming allowing you to create quick and fun maps for you to play and for the community to enjoy also.\nThe game is in a very barebones state but the potential, as with many Early Access games, is amazing. If you liked the original Survivor Squad then it's almost impossible to go wrong with Gauntlets, but don't expect a full game yet. Currently there are a few good maps made by the developers and a couple made by the community so there is something to do in the game but it's not fleshed out at all yet. Most of the levels are simple and quick to play through but as more people buy the game the levels available will surely increase because as I said before, creating your own gauntlets is not that difficult. There is currently no crafting implemented, or any kind of level structure (I am unsure of the developers plans to add these, I am hoping they do) but there are still new features in the game such as locking your characters to only attack in the direction you've set them to look instead of any in their range which allows you to hold strategic positions better than in the original Survivor Squad, in turn making the game a little more strategy than luck. There is also a new levelling and XP system that allows you to level up as you play through various gauntlets (though as of yet I am not sure where they plan to go with this feature, possibly in the direction of unlocking new weapons/items over time) which is something to look forward to.\nIf you were a fan of the original Survivor Squad or you enjoy creating levels for games you play then you will 100% enjoy this game, just don't invest yet if you're not willing to wait a while for a game that feels a little more whole. The concept is there and as Endless Loop have proven with the first game, the idea works. I can see this being a very enjoyable game once it's complete and the feedback from the community should help shape this game into something brilliant, but right now the main feature is the map editor which is most likely what you'll spend most, if not all, your time messing around with right now whilst the game is in Alpha.","March 6, 2015","true","6.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

As it stands, Gadget does not mean what you might think, but actually means "Focus Fire" and Melee actually means "Use Gadget". Confusing when playing the tutorial if you re-mapped the keys and forgot what the defaults were. Anyway, something that will be fixed.\n\nTo the game itself. My first impression was positive, immediatly bringing to mind such similar titles as "Breach & Clear: Deadline", where you are fighting off the infected/zombies and "Door Kickers", another top-down CQB strategy title that is made up of missions, not a campaign. Oddly enough "Atom Zombie Smashers" sprang to mind immmeditaly as well, and if you've played that little gem you'd see why. However, whereas "B&C:D" and "DK" focus on realistic weaponry, stats and contain strong RPG elements, this is more abstract and 'comical' with the focus firmly shifted more toward puzzle-solving than pure strategy (probably where "AZS" fits in). "SS:G" is not just a light strategy title then, but a sometimes quite complex puzzle game where you might spend up to ten frustrated minutes in PAUSE mode trying to figure out just what you are supposed to do on only one part of what could be a huge gauntlet.\n\nSo, you have from one, two or four survivors in each "gauntlet" (mission, in other words) starting  with an infiltration point and a FoW obscured map, lit only a short distance by each unit's facing radius. You'll battle your way through rooms and corridors until you find your objective, dodging a veritable horde of infected with tlents you'll be accustomed to from "L4D2" - spitters, jumpers etc. So, you survived many attacks and explored say 4 rooms up to this point (opening crates, picking up newer weapons), and are ten minutes into the gauntlet/mission (explored rooms are faintly visible so you don't need to return). Here's where the gam,e gets interesting and the difficulty rises, sometimes unintentionally. For one gauntelt it might be to find three items to open a door, each one in a different direction (north, south, east etc.). So, go south young man/woman....only it isn't a room or two you need to discpover. As you travel down that southerly corridor many rooms will presetn themselves wityh sometimes several different ways to enter them requiring the puzzle solving I mentioned. Buttons must be poressed together, or sensor plates stood on in a sequence. There is the "Aha" moment when you discover how to get into a room or corridor only to find there are so much firther to go and so many obastacles. What appears at first to be a simple, short'ish mission has now become a labarythine nightmare where you cannot save the game, but only pause (where eerything goes very, very dark. A SAVE game point, either manual or auto would be much appreciated, particualrly if you are a casual gamer or, like many you'd like to redo a stage, not start from the beginning, some 45 minutes back.\nThat's the game. Add to this a robust and fully implemented editor where you can create your own gauntlets and upload them, something that will require hours of work believe me and that is the package. There are already loads of developer created gauntlets to come to grips with, and a tab for user-created gauntlets when tney become available.\nWho will this appeal to? Not, as it stands the casual gamer in the long term, at least not without Save points or manual save. For the price though, if you enjoy squad-based strategy CQB's with puzzle solving elements you'll be right at home here. Frankly, you'll have a ball.\n\nIs it worth it if you own the original? I can't say. There is no campaign as such, but the promise of user generated content and the healthy amount already on display, then if you're a fan you might want to have a look.\n\nThe Dev is continually updating the game, refining and patching weekly, listens keenly to the community and responds - something many other Devs (even Indie Devs) could take a leaf from.\n\nI know I'll be going back for more as each time I start the game I find something new to stretch my grey matter. This is one of those titles that can easily slip past your radar, and that would be a shame. If you do enjoy what I've described then do yourselves a favour - buy it and have a ball!","April 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The game was released 1st May 15. I don't have any experience with the former "Survivor Squad" title\n\nI was provided a copy by Endless Loop Studios, for making feedback suggestions and write a honest review and would like to thank them for that.\n\nThe main setting of the game is set in a post apocalyptic world where you can chose between different scenarios called "gauntlets", these scenarios are either connected with each other or single scenarios.\nThe missions are various and can reach from search and evacuate to collect enough materials and leave the area.\n\nI found the game very basic and the graphics are nothing special which was not expected and which is not necessary. The combat is pretty fun but repetitive as the rest of the game. The controls are based on left mouse select and right mouse order controls. The game is pauseable with space.\n\n\nThe game functions well and nothing is broken or buggy, which is really good since it's like that from the launch.\n\nIf you expect a game like "Doorkicker's" with Zombies you wan't be satisfied because you can barely call the game tactical.\n\nIf you enjoy games like "The Masterplan" and other squad based shooter games then I would recommend this to any hardcore fan of the genre. However, if you're not familiar with the genre then you may find the repetitiveness of the game off putting.\nThe price is fair enough.\n\nThanks for reading :)\n\nPS:The game got Steam Workshop integration.","May 15, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The game is focused around community made maps you can create, upload and share with your friends. There are little differences between gaunlets and the regular version of the game when it comes to the gameplay but there are a few. There is no leveling system at the moment but talks of a persistent system allowing the player to have a profile and get XP for completing gauntlets is being talked about. That means possible new weapons or even abilities as you progress and beat different gauntlets. As of now there are very few maps to play and test, but I am confident that will change in the near future with all the creative people there are on Steam.\nNow the editor is quite complex, allowing you to create more than just a map to share with your friends and the community by also allowing the use of text and possibly scenario/story lines to place at certain points throughout the map. I attempted to create a gauntlet myself and test the editor and what it can do, and I'll have to say, it's just not my thing.  I'm hoping though that there is some really nice user content created soon, and available to download as I will be one of those people looking for great maps to play. Maybe I can get something created in the future as well cause I would like to create a gauntlet that would give my friends complete hell to get through or vice versa. The future for Gauntlets looks pretty promising so far and I'm really looking forward to the updates. From what I see in the forums there is a lot of suggestions and content that is going to be added to the gauntlet editor allowing for an amazing experience of traps, ambushes and bloodbaths. If you're a fan of Survivor Squad and you have a creative side, Plese pick this up and create some maps for the community! It's definitely worth a buy.\nOn another note: The Dev is doing an amazing job in the forums answering questions and taking suggetions from users. Another great thing we like to see from a game that is in Early Access.","November 21, 2014","true","1.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

You can build maps from scratch fairly easily but the complexity available is more than I am likely to test the limits of. Quite the powerful editor. It even lets you place text around the maps for flavour. You could create a plot surrounding your Gauntlet if you liked.

A game with an amazing concept and execution that it seems nobody has really heard of? That was the original Survivor Squad game for me. The crafting and looking for new survivors while trying to keep your current crew healthy enough to avoid permadeath was fun and engaging. Setting up new bases and balancing your resources between various outposts, and clearing infected zones with your selected survivors offers a glorious mash-up of Left 4 Dead and State of Decay that is absolutely mesmerizing. Survivor Squad Gauntlets is in Early Access, and lacks many of these features, but if these mechanics are combined with the new toys offered in Survivor Squad Gauntlets… It is almost assured to be a game of mammoth proportions.\n\nI absolutely love line-of-sight in games, and this game takes that very seriously. Some maps give you enough light to see movement outside your sight, but most are pitch dark and require extreme caution. A game like Teleglitch offers a wider field of vision, and this is somewhat compensated for by the fact that you have four squad members, but it can take some adjustment (and a few surprise zombie attacks) before you really know how to maneuver them as a unit. If you’re sending four guys into a room to check crates and they have their backs to the door, you may want to think again… Much safer to post someone on guard duty and take a few more seconds to loot the crates than to have uninvited guests. I’ll admit that I enjoyed finding components to craft weapons in the original more than just finding the weapons in this game, but crafting might just make its comeback yet. Picking your fights is also very important, if you’re surrounded by a horde, try to move your squad into a corridor or through a gate so they can all concentrate fire on the same area. Being rewarded for thinking strategically makes this game a real pleasure to play.\n\nThe special infected are quite varied, and aside from the Pouncer, Spitter, and Grabber, seem like innovative additions to spice up a game that might otherwise be quite droll. Room to room zombie clearing is one thing… Getting blinded by a smoke cloud and having a couple teammates dragged off makes the whole zombie-clearing thing a bit more complicated. Oh, and you might want to think twice about unleashing that assault rifle, because zombie are like toddlers… They simply LOVE noise. I can’t get enough of the frantic action this game has to offer. Most zombie games have you in first or third person, in the middle of the action, Survivor Squad goes to show that a zombocalypse is a frenetic situation no matter which way you look at it. The puzzles aren’t necessarily difficult to solve, but they do offer a nice chance of pace from breaching, clearing, and searching.  In addition to the addictive strategy, the game also features a level editor so you can create the corpse-filled slaughterhouse of your dreams. You can even edit existing levels to give them a little extra OOMPH! With this feature in place, the replayability is drastically increased, although the build menu could desperately use some music.\n\nI’ve sung the merits of my diamond in the rough, but now I must point out the flaws. The music in the game matches the action, however it is quite forgettable. The voice-acting is just passable, and the voice spam everytime you give an order can be grating, though there is an option to prevent this. The graphics are also nothing to write home about. Some puzzles, if not solved in time, can lead to a complete zombie gangbang. Keeping your members focused in the direction you specify is also quite difficult at the moment, since they spin around to help their allies when they hear gunfire, thus leaving the flank they were assigned to wide open to attack. In addition, the game would greatly benefit from a sneak mode, and the ability to autofire while the squad is performing a move order. Overall, the flaws are easy to overlook because of how enjoyable the game itself is, and just like the original Survivor Squad, I see myself playing this one for a long time to come. There is indeed a bit more polishing to be done for this little beauty, but as it stands I am delighted to see a fantastic indie game like this available for purchase.\n\nSummary: An engaging, but low-budget, top-down strategy game about murdering the undead.\n\nFinal Score: 7/10 for gameplay and replayability. 9/10 if original mechanics (crafting/travel) implemented.","November 30, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Survivor Squad: Gauntlets is a game where you control a single or group of 'survivors' in real time. You can tell them to perform actions, and they also have their own passive AI that can be adjusted in behavior depending on the situation or task at hand. The controls are very simple, but show enough complexity that you can be clever with your strategy. The main goal is to eliminate all enemies (zombies in this case) and survive till the end of the level. Sounds simple, right? Well dependant on the level, sometimes it will become a little more difficult to defend your survivors, putting them through a 'Gauntlet' of sorts, hence the title. Smart decisions and positioning matter a lot, as do who has what weapon where, and the like.\n\nOh and of course, I forgot to mention one of the most important features. The level editor. Yes, the game comes with a level editor, and it's very well put together. It's easy to understand, yet rather in depth and has a lot of content to it to truly make your own 'Gauntlet', if you will. This is where I think the game truly shines, in that, you, the devs, and the community can make this game grow by developing their own levels and posting them for other people to try. Similarly to how the game "Happy Wheels" grew to fame is because it featured a level editor with some rather basic gameplay.\n\nOverall, the game is good, especially for the price point at $8.99 USD or your regional equivalent. I'd recommend picking it up, and playing around with it. The programming work put into this game is great, and I do support the dev in his hard work!","June 3, 2015","true","0.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

All in all the game does play well and as I mentioned in the previous review, I wanted there to be some reason to controlling your survivors individually and with the update so the gates and doors could be opened. I experienced some of those moments and they were really done, I did enjoy the game.\n\nSo, I'll leave a link to my review blog where the original review will be and I'll be adding this one as well just to make it clear. One problem I do see but this is purely because I know it's going to be changed, is your survivors seem to be invincible or they are just tanks in of themselves. It's not really a problem, but I can understand how this can make the game seem boring after so long if there isn't really a need to try and survive in a survival game. I'll continue to check out the game and update my judgements through the development and if this has already been changed, then just ignore what I just said.\n\nSo, with everything I have said from the original and the recent points I've added here, I will admit, I enjoyed the game and while I can see it can get boring if you play it for a long time, I don't see this as a game you'd play in long sessions but, that is just my own personal opinion.\n\nSo if you're looking for an enjoyable, quick paced survival experience in the gauntlet setting I'd say this game nails it. I am curious as to how the game will change over the course of the development.\n\nSo, for everything I have mentioned both then and now, I would recommend this game if you want a fast paced, survival experience without all the stress of a hard core survival game.

Here's my review, subject to change the more I play.\n\nPros\nLots of content. Even community-made content. "Gauntlets" are maps/levels to play on. It almost has the feel of the Portal 2 workshop, where community chambers can be made and played by the community. There are also some pre-built Gauntlets made by EndlessLoopStudios themselves, which are pretty difficult (at least for me, seeing how I don't regularly play these type of games).\nInteresting game. A zombie shooter where you control not only one person, but four? Plus, Gauntlets will have puzzles to solve involving you to maneuver and strategize with each person on your team to different areas. Like micro-managing units in Starcraft II.\nEach Gauntlet (if built correctly and efficiently) will last you around half an hour to an hour each. Lots of gameplay for something Early-Access. Not many games has this much content alone, let alone while still on Early Access.\nFriendly Devs, always seem to be updating and asking for community support. This game has great promise!\nCons\nTutorial seems a little vague. There was a moment where all four of my units(?) had to press four buttons, one button each, to open a door. Luckily I got past it by pure speed of it (press 1, right click, press 2, right click, press 3, etc.), but it wasn't until 30 minutes into the Gauntlet that I realized that it's also like Dragon Age where you could pause it and issue commands while paused.\nThis con has no weight to it, because it's opinion based. These type of games aren't for me specifically, because I have a hard time with multiple heroes to control at once, especially trying to micro-manage them all to specific locations.\nUnit(?) portraits seem a little unattractive, but this might be the game's art style itself, which is fine. This is just me being picky.\nOverall, I'd rate this a 9/10. It feels like a mixture of a lot of different games I've played. Left 4 Dead, Portal 2, Dragon Age, and Starcraft seem to be the top most inspirations to this game, which isn't a bad thing. I recommend it for those gamers who enjoy micro-managing units like this. It's not heavy on the micro-managing, but of course the better you are, the better your score at the end.","March 18, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Infected have different abilities to attack you and are generally smart, if you’re in their field of view, they come at you fast.\n\nThere’s not much in terms of music here, I would like to see some ambient atmospheric soundtrack in the mix. However, it’s a nice to have than a necessity.\n\nI had to get used to the game’s graphic style, the characters look fine, but in terms of the environment, objects, houses and UI, it needs to be more defined. Areas that require your character to search are not outlined and blend in too much so they’re not obvious to the player. More reward is needed when you search boxes, draws etc. As most in the game were empty.\n\nIt’s a great game for the goal it sets out to achieve, I like how you can comment on each map and see a leaderboard. There’s also a level editor where you can create and play other Gauntlets, very important for endless game play and a driving factor to purchase this game.\n\nI would like to see multiplayer being implemented, but that’s not a deal breaker.\n\nA fun game that comes recommended.","April 22, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Plus I can't get exactly what I want with these controls, making it go slow as I try to figure out how to manage them. There is just a slight weird feeling to them and moving each character and trying to make them do exactly what you want doesn't work all the time as they end up looking another direction to have their necks chewed at by the zombies behind them (Which your guys don't really even turn around and shoot them most of the time). Which I get to another point of the game. It's boring because it's not even much of a game where you manage your squad. There needs to be a system to make them all feel like humans and not just mindless minions with guns. Which can be accomplished in many ways. Permadeath added to them, Once they go down once, they have to use some form of healing to make sure that they can go down once more. If they don't get a healing and lose all their health, they are dead. That's the last of them. And perhaps you can make it so once they have been downed and they are low on health again, they will panic and run away or something similar to that? Find ways to make them seem human and actually add challenge knowing that these guys can panic or become blood thirsty morons and will charge in without you telling them too. It would add a bit of the squad management this game needs. In Gauntlet creation, stuff like walls need a "Hold Mouse1 to stretch the walls out" not a click once, click again. Naturally what I did was hold click at the beginning and let go. Which confused me why the wall didn't create and was still on my cursor which made my feel like I went outside the window border.\n\n*BUGS* Now, as for the bugs of this game, most of them are in the creation mode, as text going over other icons cuts the icons into the background, the jeep isn't selectable, and so is a few other things i place down. Whenever I try to move something it just ends with a weird camera movement and a bunch of confusion.\n\n*JUDGEMENT*\nSo at the moment, it needs a bit of work. But don't fret! That's what Early access is for! And thank god the developers of this game are actually listening to the players. But the question is, should I get this game at it's current state? Well if you liked the first game, I would probably suggest this for you as it's only going to be improved, it just might take some time. Now as a person who didn't play the first game, should you try this? Well... wait a while before you do. You will probably want this game to be a bit more closer to finished before you make your judgement to buy this game. As for the moment it's really unfinished and lacking in content. But make sure you keep checking this game out, it will get better and I can promise you that 100%!\n\n*EDIT*: So I found out, if you turn anti-aliasing off completely when building a gauntlet, it's COMPLETELY broken, which explains that part. Also the controls just need a bit more getting use to, but I am getting the hang of it.","April 15, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The control options for your squad members (up to 4) are simple and fast to learn but hard to master when facing hoards of Zeds, and while you can mow down a lot of them they will overpower you if you fail to place your crew in a good formation as the focus during the missions is pretty much on line-of-sight management and failure to properly space out your crew and let them cover the different possible areas where Zeds might pop up will end with you becoming Zombie fodder.\n\nBesides basic squad movement and tactics the game also features simple (and more complex) puzzle areas that often will reward you with better loot if you manage to pull them off, further boosting your chance to get through the mission.\nAll of those can be recreated, and further refined on, in the very powerful mission Editor which, as already mentioned, is one of the big selling points of the title; with players being able to share their creations with each other which allowing for a, theoretically, infinity amount of new missions and scenarios.\n\nSome might criticize that there is no progression between missions, nothing to 'level up' but I have to say that I find this rather refreshing as it keeps every mission as a set challenge without the risk to be too powerful or too weak to get through it and it also keeps all those rather annoying 'level up fast' and 'max loot' scenarios from the player created scenario list which make up a large amount in other games featuring community driven content creation.\n\nNow grab it and go shoot dead dudes deader.","April 24, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The original Jagged Alliance (already available on Steam) is an open campaign of a game where the player moves between zones and tries to reach the conclusion of an over-arching in a very free-roam open-world environment, which is sort of what Survivor Squad is. Deadly Games, which was the second game in the series was to Jagged Alliance what Gauntlets is to Survivor Squad. It gives up the openworld, free roam format for a more story driven, level or mission based play style that possesses a much more detailed and linear story than the original, which is also much shorter than the original. The campaign it comes with is 6 missions long and I honestly have yet to finish it, but have played enough that I have a good idea of how it plays out. It's fair enough but in itself not enough that I would actually recommend this game. It would be, as many of my reviews a negative review with a caveat that focuses on a specific niche audience that I recommend try it anyway... Gauntlets is more than just a 6 mission campaign that uses a similar engine though.\n\nSurvivor Squad: Gauntlets has is a lot more intricate and has a degree of complexity to what can be done with the engine that the original did not reach, including the ability to have much larger maps to play on.\n\nIn addition, Survivor Squad: Gauntlets has an editor that lets players use the engine to craft their own missions and campaigns, giving it a much larger possible scope than the developer produced content it starts with and it is for this reason that I'd tilt my verdict from a negative review to a mildly positive one.\n\nIn all, at the less than $10 price point, it's worth a try for anyone that likes the zombie-horror and survival genre, and a must-try for anyone that was a fan of the original Survivor Squad and what it may lack in initial content has great potential to be added to by the community as well as additional content from the developer through additional Gauntlets  (or missions) that can easily be found through the game itself and already consists of enough additional Gauntlets to give it much more potential playtime than the handful of challenging missions it starts with.\n\nThough I wouldn't call it one of the best games I've ever played, I would consider it no less of a waste of money than the original was and is definitely entertaining enough to be worth it's price.","May 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The variety in maps you could play in the first game was limited – but very challenging. When you completed a new map you felt like you had accomplished something, so it was the perfect storm of challenging and rewarding gameplay, with the scavenging element that appeals to the treasure hoarder in me.\n\nMore at:  http://vgalmanac.com/reviews/survivor-squad-gauntlets/","March 15, 2015","true","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You must complete objectives and loot buildings for better weapons. I'ts a simple yet funny game.\n\nCAMPAIGN The campaign has 6 levels. They are fun to play but a little short. The game offers a tutorial for new players. Nothing special.\n\nENEMIES Well, it are zombies ofcourse. But there are different kind of zombies in the game with special "abilities". The "minion", "bulky", "jumper", "spitter", "blinder", "grabber" and the "carrier". These different kind of zombies offers alot more danger while playing the game.\n\nEDITOR This is where the game truely shines. The editor offers a huge amount of options and objects to make your own campaign how you want it to be. The normal campaign is fully build with this editor, so everything you see in the campaign, ( I won't spoil anything ) can be made in the editor. The editor also offers alot of tutorials. It's simple to use and yet very powerfull.\n\nTL;DR It's a game worth trying out. If you are more focussed on the campaign I suggest buying their first game instead of this one. If your more into editing and making your own missions, I highly suggest this one.\n\n","June 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","8","15","3","0"

This is a change in what I usually play, gotta say. I like it too! It's very creative and unique, and the price right now is something people should take advantage of. I've sorta played some things like this before, Breach and Clear comes to mind, but this take on it is something I don't think I've experienced.\n\nThere is no story mode to the game, but that's countered by the fact that, well, you can make your own story up! Not a lot of games like to do those sorts of things with their editors, tending to focus on making the level instead of creating a story. This game seems to do both. Sadly, I'm no good at it right now, and I'm not sure if this is with all levels since I only played an Endless Loop map, but by the looks of it you can do a lot of things.\n\nThe name of the game also really mirrors what seems to happen. It's a Gauntlet and it's likely you'll spend 40-50 mins a map if the person put enough effort into it. That's either a pro or con depending on how long you're willing to invest in a level. Also, keep in mind that I've only played Endless Loop maps, so it may just be them.\n\nA thing I didn't like really enjoy was being unable to die. Well, I enjoyed it and didn't. When I realized I couldn't die, I made a lot more careless mistakes and at one point walked through lasers because I felt like it. Blood loss helps in determining your score at the end though, and that gives players some reason to not get hurt. Although, a checkpoint system with deaths might be better, idk it's hard to say since I don't enjoy dying and going back over and over but also don't like being invincible.\n\nCharacter portraits are kinda eh and resemble South Park fan characters more than desperate survivors. This wasn't a big deal for me though and I eventually looked past it when I got to enjoying the game.\n\nA little more customization with characters would also be appriciated. Every game you seem to spawn with random survivors, and to my knowledge there's no way to, say, set custom names or make certain characters always be in your party. You just get what RNG gives.\n\nLastly, there's a rank system but it only seems to be for show. I think finding a way to use that rank without locking important content would be something to consider. Maybe an emblem system, or patches, or banners, or more ways to customize characters, or maybe even unlocking new characters to use in the RNG. Stuff like that so you get more shiny things while being able to enjoy the full game.\n\nI'll update the more I play, fixing mistakes I may have made or adding in some mistakes I've seen or new suggestions I thought of. I know I've played for about an hour as I write this, but I can tell this game has massive potential and I'm excited to see the direction this game takes.","April 11, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","6"

This means that the survivors are sometime very lemming like because you can send them to their ultimate death and they will never question that.\n\n*Edit* I preveously had a problem with the survivors not being able to shoot while walking, this has sort of been fixed. In the patch notes it says that it is a delicate part of the game and that shows as the survivors only shot while moving a few times, about 5 while going against a giant horde. It is there though and im looking foward to when it is full implamented.*Edit*\n\nThe creation of the gauntlets is brilliant. I knocked up a simple, but reasonable, gauntlet. It is simple which means that you can create an amazing level that you didn’t have to study for a year to be able to create. This means that this game has an unlimited amount of levels that will be created by the community.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games or those who like gauntlets running or creating them. I would also recommend this game because it isn’t finished. This may sound weird but this game is very complete and I would recommend this game as if it were a complete game.

If you played the original Survivor Squad, then you already know you will like this!\nThis is an aboslute amazing spin-off from the original game, hats off to the devs!\n\nThe basic premise of the game is quite simple. It's a top down strategic shooter that lets you take control of (up to) four survivors as a squad. Each can be moved and line of sight set independently, or as a whole. The goal? To navigate through a level (or in this case, a Gauntlet) and make it intact and alive to the Heli pad at the end. But this is only the beginning and where it gets real fun!\n\nThe idea behind Survivor Squad Gauntlets is that is community based game. That's right, community based. The key feature of the game is a Gauntlet Editor that allows you to make your own levels and share them with the community to play. Likewise, you can play levels that other players have made and that is where the possibilities become Endless! Levels also have a Ranking system so that you can Rank Up or Down levels you like or dislike and see what community favorites are.\n\nThe Gauntlet Editor is fairly intuitive and easy to use, and comes with some tutorials to learn the basics of creating levels. It doesn't take long to get the hang of it, and you can create a fairly basic level in a short sitting. If making more involved/larger/epic levels is your cup of tea, your welcome to do that also, with a Saving System so that you can stop where you are, come back hours/days/months later and finish your level. It took me about 3 hrs to get the hang of the Editor, make a level, and get it posted for the Community. Now all that's left is to see how it ranks amongst the players.  There is even a Search Option in the community levels so you can search for keywords.\n\nAll in all, this game has been fun to play with and learn how to use. I normally wouldn't highly suggest a Early Access game, but this one is an exception! I would even reccomend this game over the original! This game receives Fritz's Seal of Approval. The idea is excellent, and delivered in a similar fashion withe more features to come! Obey the Donkey!

I haven't played it for long, so please understand how short and undetailed this review is. A more detailed review will come later.\n\nI haven't played the previous title Survivor Squad, but this definitely feels like a better game. I'm not sure how the previous title works, but I am in favour of it being split into various short, sharp missions (or drills if you will). It means you're able to play the game if you have some time to kill, but don't have the time to commit to anything too long.\n\nWhen I played, I found the tutorial was lacking at various parts - though that could be down to me not knowing what I'm supposed to be doing. I felt the objective marker would disappear if I had gone to the right place, but hadn't hit the objective. I was eventually able to figure it out, but I do think I could have been helped out a bit more by the game, especially because this was the early stages of the game (barely past the tutorial).\n\n\nDo I recommend? I think it is a fun title and there's definitely something to get out of it, but whether the $8.99 asking point is too much is another question entirely. It might depend on if you've played the previous iteration. For now though, I enjoyed it, so I am giving it a thumbs up.","June 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

This review is of the Alpha 0.25 and is subject to change.\n\nSurvivor Squad: Gauntlets is a Real Time Tactics game where you lead up to 4 survivors through a ♥♥♥♥ ton of zombies. So far I've encountered Spitters (Guys who spit acid coulds), Jumpers (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who jump at survivors and stop them from moving), Grabbers (♥♥♥♥sticks who pull survivors towards them and stop them from moving) and some fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who take more bullets.\n\nMy No.1 problem with the game is that it just feels like it's on autopilot. Compared to Doorkickers (The closest game to this I can think of), this game doesn't really require any planning. Zombies drop like a paid hooker, even with the weakest gun (Gordon). You just move to the helipad, and maybe do a puzzle or two. Nothing really stops you. I respect that the intent of this game is to have the Gauntlets act as 'score attack' levels where players try to get the highest score possible, but beyond that there isn't really much point to replaying a Gauntlet again, and I'd dare say out of the ones I've played so far (Granted, I haven't played all of them) they've all really felt the same.\n\nProblem No.2 is the fact that this game really does seem dependant on users creating content. This isn't a bad way to extend the life of a game, don't get me wrong, but you better hope you can build one hell of a community. I don't know if any items are new from the previous Survivor Squad (as I have not played it) but if no new items, weapons or zombie types have been added, I could see some fans of the original being fairly upset if they have to pay for another game that only really adds an editor.\n\nGraphically this game is pretty bad to be honest. Most things look okay, but the tires look like poorly drawn circles in MS Paint and the character portraits look like cartoons also drawn in MS Paint. A little more focus in this would improve the game a lot. You could also get some mates together and take photos of their face if you want some better portraits. Hell, I'm sure plenty of people would be willing to 'donate' their faces to the game.\n\nDespite all of this, the editor itself is pretty solid to be honest. This isn't exactly a complicated game (in the big picture of things), but the editor is functional, and I've been able to work it out fairly well. It could do with a better tutorial, but to be honest, that's more than games such as Doorkickers and the ARMA series (the only two games  I could think of that have level editors that I play).\n\nThe controls do work, apart from reviving downed survivors (which will be fixed). Controls are pretty simple, and don't take too long to get use to.\n\nAll in all, this game has potential, but in it's current state, it's not very challenging nor does it demand any strategical thinking from the player.The graphics are too simpilistic and the devs are leaning too much on the content created by the players. At the same time, I will state that most games in early Alpha probably have this level of polish (especially indie games) so am optimistic that this game will improve.","April 24, 2015","false","3.8"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","4"

Completely gone. You couldn't make your own Survivors and level them up, build up your base, none of it. Instead it is just a mission based campaign that I couldn't finish because of how annoyed I was at the Material Gathering mission. In the original Survivor Squad I liked starting with only two survivors then over time gaining skills and more survivors to help find the cure.\nThe Second thing that made me even more sad was to see that the game was focused on multi-player. The campaign being small then the rest being levels, oops Gauntlets, shared with each other like Little Big Planet. I don't really like games that are multiplayer focused even though this game is not but I saw that with the campaign looking small and no other visible single player content, I inferred that this was multiplayer focused.\nThe things I do like about the game are the new gadgets ,weapons, new people graphics and more than just RAIN! It was actually day in one of the missions and that made me so happy. Some neat features I did like were the "knock down" mechanic where if you lose all health your survivor is knocked down and needs help. I still think even after they are knocked down if zombies are eating them they should eventually die but they don't!\nI checked out the editor and did some of the "challenges". The potential levels that could be made with the editor is obvious and I would love to see what people come up with in the future.\n\nTLDR / Summary\nCons\nNo Campaign mode like the First Survivor Squad. Only missions.\nSurvivors can't die.\nMultiplayer focus/ Little Singleplayer content (so far)\nPro\nNew gadgets and weapons\nCool new editor\nNew graphics and mechanics\n(This review might be updated if a future patch or update adds something large into the game.","May 1, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","2"

If you're unaware of what survivor squad is, just think of your average zombie game and imagine it from a top-down 2D perspective, while it is a zombie game which seem to be thrown a bit quick and loose theese days it's still worth your time very much worth your time since it isn't the typical zombie adventure where you play as a nameless faceless errol flynn who holds up other players for thier treasure and beans. The game forces 4 characters upon you, one of whom shares the same name as me so I decided he'd be the one the others would be meat shields for, It's your job to make sure the survivors don't get mauled by the countless zombies holding knifes and forks and rubbing thier tummys and It's an equal job to make sure the zombies hiding in bedside cabinets don't rip out your giblets when you search them, which I found annoying as I saw them as cheap jumpscares which have the scare factor of an elderly dog covered in a bed sheet with eyeholes cut out making a funny noise like it has no control over it's bladder, and If the jump scares in survivor squad were like an elderly dog I'd want to move it swiftly before It urinates on my persian rug.","March 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

When you first start it up it asks you to go through a simple tutorial to learn how to control your survivors. After that you get to the real fun of the game: Gauntlet missions.\nThese missions are player made scenarios made using the in depth editor. I was not expecting the editor to be so robust. You can make whole stories inside this thing. It's pretty amazing. There is also a tutorial for the editor so you can get a feeling for how it works.\nWhen you are in the game you control your survivors RTS style by selecting them and right clicking a spot to move them. You can order your survivors to face a certain direction and focus on it so you have an area covered. Covering an area is VERY important in this game. Line of sight plays a big role in this. If you cant see it, it will kill you. This means you will want to either have all your corners covered or be in a place that only has one entrance.\nIf you aren't used to RTS games it will take some time to get used to moving the survivors. If you ever get flustered the game has a quick pause button so you can plan out what you want to do.\nOverall this game is a fun thing to play with. If the community picks up for it there is no limit for the amount of things you can do with it.\nI give this game a 9/10 overall.","April 28, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just thought this was needed. Anyhow.. To the review. (Feel free to skip to the bottom for a summary as I tend to ramble whenever I do stuff like this)\n\n\nTo begin with I am going to say that I loved the first one. Not quite finished it as I got it around the same time as I bought games like Far Cry 4, Assassins Creed Unity, GTA V and a bunch of others.. So I have been playing those instead. I plan on finishing the first one at some point but yeah. Loved that game so I knew I was bound to love this one.\nNow I have played this game, Yup. Love it. I got a little stuck on the Brock and Dave campaign level but I think that is just because I was being stupid. Was looking around for the building for a while but couldnt find it.. I just had to explore some more.\n\nThe two main things I like are the fact that there are more interesting guns (This could be wrong as I didnt finish the first one, But there are more that I know of so yah).. And that there is more talking between the characters.\nThings that I am not quite a fan of are that there is no longer a death system, Its just damage. I mean, I guess its understandable but I kinda liked it being real hard in the other one where I was always trying to do things perfectly but I guess this may just be a dev choice that he wanted to do or something. Lack of meele at the start is also sad, As I would of liked to slice some zombies up silently at the start without alerting everything else on the map but yeah.\n\nThe only bug that I found (If it is even a bug) is that some resolutions dont quite work right with the game. I tried to be on fullscreen 1920x1200 (My screen size) but some stuff was missing off the side of the screen. Noticed this with a bunch of various random sizes too. Will update this later if I find any more when I play some more but yeah.\n\n\nAnyhow. To summarize this game is well worth the price. If you liked the first game then you will like this one for sure. If you have yet to play the first one and you are looking for a squad based strategy game then still buy this game. Also buy the first one as it is just as good.\nAs a little addition I would also like to add that it is always nice to see that Early Access is not just full of absolute garbage that makes you wish Early Access was not a thing. This game is a light of hope for Early Access. 10/10 guys. Keep it up. o/","April 30, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explorermariner/recommended/331720/","explorermariner","Cap'n Barry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explorermariner/","55 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSurvivor Squad: Gauntlets is a squad management zombie survival game with a top down PoV and a focus on the line-of-sight mechanic.\n\nYou have control over a group of survivors, as a whole and independently from each other, and have to micromanage these aspects of control in order to complete each gauntlet or mission. You will need to tactically plan ahead of every movement you make or you'll end up suffering the consequences of poor foresight, which often include having your arm chewed on by an undead.\n\nBut what control does Survivor Squad: Gauntlets give us in order to avoid such a fate? Well, firstly there's movement, you will need to move and you will need to do it in different ways according to each situation you encounter. Maybe you want to make a run for an exit and risk gathering a horde behind you... Or maybe you'd prefer to be safe and sound and walk, guns held tight and ready? Maybe you want to send each survivor in a direction to collect supplies and save time, because you never know what can happen as the night progresses... Or you'd prefer to keep it tight and take your time? Whatever you decide, you will need to get a move on sooner or later, so you better think well where you're going.\n\nAnother mechanic you'll need to master to achieve success, and one the game puts a special emphasis on, is the Line of Sight. Your survivors can't shoot at what they can't see, much like in real life. Line of Sight interacts with your surroundings as well, including getting narrower vision if you're in a small alley, or being able to see through a crack in the wall or a window, or even security cameras if you can access them! Remember that your survivors can act independently and as a group, and if one of them sees something the rest of the team will notice too, so take advantage of this and make each of them cover as much ground as possible to avoid any sneaky zed from suprising you. If you want, you can also make them focus on their line of sight only and to ignore the calls of the others, really useful if you're caught in a horde in a place with more than one entrance and need all the entrances to be covered at all times.\n\nOf course, what would a zombie game be without guns? So far I've encountered pistols, shotguns, rifles, flamethrowers and even grenade launchers. Each one has its own stats and each one is useful in different situations, for example, a grenade launcher might be ideal if you're entrenched in a building and covering an entrance, but it might not be the best thing to carry if you're in the open or in a tight building.\n\nThen there's items. As you progress through a gauntlet you may find a variety of items that could be of use in your mission. Ranging from videocameras to teleporters, passing through autoturrets and sonars and a myriad more, you will find a use for every single one in multiple situations: Need to hold of an horde whilst waiting for an evac? An autoturret will mow down the incoming zeds in a hail of bullets. Collecting supplies and need to drop them off at your transport? Teleport away and avoid walking in the open and risking getting caught by a random horde (just make sure you don't run out of energy for it!).\n\nAnd then there's what I'll admit are my absolute favorite parts of each gauntlet: the interactivity and the situations. Normally you will have a more or less specific objective to accomplish, but the game lets you decide how to fullfil it. Apart from that, the map is full of little curios that you can interact with (or not) to achieve a certain outcome. Each one is different and sometimes you won't be sure of the outcome, but you might want to risk it anyway, who knows? Maybe it'll open a secret path, an armory or a shortcut if you press  that  button... Or it might trigger an alarm, a bomb or who knows what! The situations are also great, this game achieves an atmosphere of uncertainty that really gives it a special charm and that I think more games of the zombie genre should strive to achieve. You can never be sure of anything, you might think you have everything planned beforehand and start walking, but who knows if a random horde will trigger that you didn't prepare yourself for? Or the way might be blocked without you knowing, or there might be a bomb in a building that you just entered and will have to risk your life disabling it, or let it take the building and whatever valuables might be inside, and lose a potential stronghold for later on in the process. This interactivity combined with variety of situations and feeling of uncertainty works really well in Survivor Squad: Gauntlets. Other games with similar mechanics (squad management) often become a bit stale because you basically just click and wait, click and wait, click and wait because everything is easy to plan for and there's nothing to put you under stress or make you react; in Survivor Squad: Gauntlets you certainly click, but I wouldn't wait if I were you, better keep an eye up because anything can happen... and will probably happen.\n\nOn a more technical note, there's the graphics and sound. No, it's no Crysis, but it's got a nice style going on and it looks good to the eye and sounds good to the ear, what else can you ask for? The style works well with the game and the main non-gameplay feature (the gauntlets), where a more cumbersome style might cluster your vision too much, but Survivor Squad: Gauntlets manages to find a nice equilibrium. The sound is good too, not spectacular, but good enough. On a note, but reiterating that it IS in fact still Early Access, the music is not too varied and can get repetitive to listen to the same tracks over and over, if the developers are planning on adding more tracks, then all the better, and if not you can always disable the ingame music and play a custom playlist of yours for a more personalized experience.\n\nLastly, and what I think sells the game better than anything, is, as the title of the game would suggest to you, the gauntlets.  These are the scenenarios on which you play each time. The developers have made quite a bit of them that act as a story, but what's really awesome is that you can create custom ones and share them or play in gauntlets made by other players like you! This feature is awesome and ensures that you can always pop up the game and have a new experience even if you have wore out the rest of features the game has to offer.\n\nAll in all I really, really, really recommend this game to everybody regardless of their preferred genre, even if you haven't played a squad management game the tutorial and first missions will teach you fast enough so that in ten minutes you can work your way around the game intuitively. And if you've played them, then you will love this one.\n\nSo grab your shotty and remember, leave no man behind!","April 29, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was easy to learn but more difficult to master and perfect. I do like that there is a Gauntlet Builder mode it's a great idea but I could not really get into it, it just wasn't my kind of thing. That aside what I'd like to see in Survivor Squad: Gauntlets is more survivors to control at one time I think that would be difficult and interesting but kind of contradicts the title Survivor "Squad". I'd also like to see a much stronger zombie that takes multiple survivors to take down because most of the zombies right now a survivor can take on alone and I think it would make teamwork stand out more. I'd also like to see survivors able to die because as of now a survivor can be down forever as far as I see so if a time limit were add to that I think it'd make it a much more dire need to revive the downed guy. I also feel like the laser does almost too much damage to your survivors. I also think the editor tutorials should go more in depth as I found it hard to understand how to do certain things in the challenges. I think the campaign should also be longer. Other than that it's a great game and I really enjoy it and would like to play it's final release.","April 29, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get access to EVERY possible tool, and you can use anything to your advantage (even custom cutscenes in your level), and the developer picks some of the best levels and polishes them to the quality of what you would expect from the game, and they do not disappoint! I absolutely recommend this game, it shows just how fleshed out you can make a level editor and it properly communicates how to use it despite being very complex.","May 19","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
