Somehow I hoped we had seen the last of Derek Smart.  Don't get me wrong, I don't despise the man, but his snarky, combative attitude in the face of the overwhelming evidence regarding his shortcomings as a developer have left me hoping for the day when he retires from public life; that, and I was one of the foolish who purchased Universal Combat when it came out only to discover it was broken and buggy even after several patches and any attempts to challenge this was met by scorn and insult by Derek Smart himself.\n\nThis is not a good game.  It will not be a good game no matter how many times he changes the name.  It IS a very ambitious game, however.  To his credit, Derek Smart tried to make a game that pushed hardware and design boundaries.  The sad reality is that he failed, but rather than accept this and work with critics to address the problems he chose to attack whatever fanbase he had for pointing out the shortcomings of the game,.  Now it is on steam (for free, no less) and that is supposed to diminish your ability to criticise this product, but for those of us who purchased the game when it first came out it just brings back visions of falling through surfaces, user interfaces better suited to spreadsheet software than a game and terrible, game destroying bugs.\n\nI won't address the visuals, which for the time were not bad.  I bought the game originally because of the promise of fps and ship based exploration and combat, and what I ended up with were two halves that never really seemed to fit together or work even on their own.  Attempting to hold the two halves together is an interface that is poorly thought out (see how long it takes you to figure out how quit for a start) and overcomplicated with fields and windows of redundant settings best handled with a single button or accessible from a quick bar.\n\nIt's unfortunate (but not surprising) to see that time has not changed Derek at all; looking at the comments on steam he continues to attack naysayers with the same eagerness he did on his own forums once, and that is a shame.  I would have hoped that the years had brought him some wisdom about dealing with critics and fans alike, and that rather than insult their intelligence and rebuff their concerns with snarky comments he would have hired a PR representative who has less of an irrational response to criticism.\n\nYou will likely play Universal Combat regardless of my review, and I invite you to do so.  You will also discover that the game has some nebulous design decisions and unresolved bugs that will hamper your enjoyment.  Just do not expect your feedback or criticism to be well received or heeded at all by the game's designer as he has great difficulty accepting flaws in his work, though he will gladly take all of your praise.","February 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 657 of 752 people (87%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","87","657","752","73","30"

Lets see....what am i going to play....?\nI think i will be a terran paramedic! That sounds fun, doesnt it?\n\nOk, what to do? There are no orders. There is no fleet. There is a whole lot of nothing and me in an unarmed ship. Oooh wait there actually is a ship in distress. Thats a job for us mateys! We approach! All men to their stations! We are going to doooo... -nothing. Thats right. There is no action we could take to actually help the distressed fellow.\nCan that truly be? Lets check the discussion board. Some other guys also wondered what the purpose of that career might be.\n\nAha, thats interesting. Everyone should be glad that the developer gave us so many different possibilities to play the game and we are such dumb idiots that we cant use our imagination to play the game properly. Yes thats right! Its all in our imagination! Sit in your bathtub and you are the captain of a nuclear submarine on its mission to save earth. Imagination YAAAAYYYYY!!! So much fun!!!\n\nWell, lets try something different then. A military carreer seems more appropriate for the game setting. What to do, what to do? Ok i figured it out a little. I embarked on a planet, i ran around, i even shot something. I dont know exactly what  i did it for. The planet was marked as hostile. Hurray for imagination! I shoot at the enemy base with my spaceship destroying some cardboard building like thingies - supposed to be a military installation. And nothing else happens.\nLets have a look at the forum again. Do my actions have any impact? Not really. Bases rebuild themselfes after you destroy them. Spaceships spawn randomly. Everything resets, if you just wait long enough.\n\nYou have a huge galaxy filled with meaningless balls (planets) and ships and no purpose at all.\n--> Imagination\nProblem is: With an empty sheet and a pencil you could truly use your imagination. With this game your possibilities to actually interact with anything are very limited. You can fly to it, you can land/dock or shoot it. Thats about it then. And whatever you do, it does not matter in the slightest.\n\nPeople, dont get fooled. This game is not complex, it is just poorly designed. You can fly your ship using the cursor keys. There is no huge background mechanic that wants to be figured out. It was hollow, it is hollow and it will be hollow in all future releases (please let it be the last one...it is just an unsatisfying waste of time).\nIf you want something complicated and fun, try dwarf fortress. Thats a game to love!\n\nI bought the Battlecruiser Millenium Edition back then...i was so incredibly disappointed and furious. When i lingered in the shop and spotted someone who grabbed the game box i would go and talk them out of buying the game. I hope i saved some folks a little money and the huge dissapointment of this franchise.\n\nRIP\n\n--------------------------\nEDIT: 29.07.2015\n\nWith the "DLC - The Lyrus Conflict" it gets even more ridiculous. This developer is selling his idea for a game (in my opinion it has never been complete) in a new coat over and over and over.\n\nDerek Smart, 24.07.2015: "Yeah, the DLC (Lyrus Conflict) is basically lot of refinements, and graphics overhaul. No new features. That's for Universal Combat Advanced which is full blown sequel."\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/345580/discussions/0/613957600540266427/#p7\n\nDerek Smart, 07.02.2015: "But basically, if I do end up doing it as planned (Universal Combat Advanced), it will have the same gameplay features as this 2015 remastering of UCCE v2.0 but with a complete graphics overhaul..."\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/345580/discussions/0/606068060825246172/\n\nHow people still dont see through this charade is beyond my grasp. He is doing it since 20 years.\n\nI know, i know, we are all waiting for that capital ship simulator since we seen Battlestar Galactica / Star Wars. We got to wait some more. This game series is not it and never will be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celticfang/recommended/345580/","celticfang","Fire and Ice...and Caffiene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celticfang/","1009 products in account","So.....this game.\n\nPutting aside any personal isssues with Derek Smart (and let's be honest, a lot of people have issues with him), let's try to be as objective as possible in this review...\n\nWhat exactly is UC and does it live up to its claims?\n\n\nIt's a 'do anything in space' simulator. You want to command a battlecruiser? Check. You want to be a Marine on a planet shooting stuff? Check. You want to fly from a planet to space and dock with that carrier you see over there? Check.\n\nThe problem is...well....the problems are...\n\nOne: Excessive micro management: Why for instance, should the commander of a large ship have to manually set power levels? Why can't....say....the crrew AI do that for you and if you want to then alter it, you can? By default, there isnt't enough power to go around and you have to go in and manually set it. Or, say you want to send....I don't know, four Marines and a tank and a pilot to a planet. You have to tell each individual what to do. There's no group option.\n\nTwo: HUD issues. The HUD itself isn't intuitive at all, the three MFDs at the bottom of the screen don't easily tell you what they are, the radar is 2d, not 3D and that is confusing as well as you got no clue if the enemy target is above or blow you.\n\nThree: Questionable vehicle physics. Why should a shuttle be able to stop on a dime in space? I can understand tanks or ATVs stopping quickly on a planet, that makes sense, however...a shuttle, in space, you cut the power and it instantly stops? Really? Yes, I'm aware it's explained away as some technical stuff but that's an easy and cheap way to get around the issue.\n\nSo what are the good points then given I've laid out some issues with it?\n\nOne: You can literally go anywhere and do anything you want to. For instance in a free roaming scenario, I have taken a battlecruiser from Ear to the Moon, landed troops, done exercises, got picked up by the shuttle and flown back, all without cutscenes or scripting.\n\nTwo: It's seamless once it loads. Yep that's a big, big plus. You want to go from planet to space? Get above a certain height and push a button, then confirm it (again....micro management issues but....), there's a few seconds worth of animation and you're in space. Same for going to a planet.s, get close, it'll ask establish planetfall, say yes,a nd sit back.\n\nIt's pretty. Oh yes it is, it's some of the most atmospheric graphics in a space game....and you feel as if you can actually go to that nebula, or that planet....or even that base and dock there\n\nYou are not the hero. Okay, this is  astrange one but....most games are all about the player, right? Well, UC, CE isn't. There's an entire universe going on, things happen regardless of you being around or not. You can be in a system and go off for a few days, come back and find that station you were docked at got attacked and changed hands, or there's a war on a planet that broke out while you were going there.\n\nHowever....I personally wouldn't recommend it unless you want to spend a LOT of time reading and learning. It's not a simple pick up and play game in the least, it takes time, dedication and (sadly) figuring things out on your own so you don't have to deal with Derek Smart to enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, once you like it, it's definitely good but I do feel many, many people will be put off by Derek Smart and won't even look at it.\n\nIf UC was made by somebody else and released on Steam for free, it would get a much, much better reception, I can absolutely say that for certain.\n\nEither way, although this has not recommended at  the top, try try it out. Make up your own mind and be prepared for a lot of reading and learning too.","May 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 98 of 115 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","98","115","4","16"

I alt+tabbed anyway and it crashed the game which is a real shame because I had to read through the 93-page PDF Game Manual just to find out how to move my ship forward.\n\nUniversal Combat CE is just another renamed, slightly updated version of Derek Smart's Battlecruiser 3000AD series from 1996. Much like its NINE predecessors (that's right, there are 9 previous versions of this same game), Universal Combat is horribly plagued by gamebreaking bugs, poor interface and design, horrendously glitchy gameplay, extremely boring and poorly written storyline, no tutorial and lack of explanation for basically everything in the game. The controls and ship GUI are so confusing, it will leave you scratching your head at pretty much everything.\n\nI wouldn't even pay a dollar for this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/testcastle/recommended/345580/","testcastle","Martin Luther Quickscope King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/testcastle/","247 products in account","Calling this game a "collector's edition" is like calling a used red solo cup a "goblet fit for only a king's mouth". Imagine a big disgusting bag of trash, and then dumping that into a septic tank and taking a long bath in there. That's basically what you're going to get with this abomination of a video game. The following two segments illustrates my first two playthroughs:\n\n1. Spawned as the chestical soldier on Earth (elite combat marine with two gigantic chest pads no matter what gender) and some alpha guys that looked like me and were friendly started running up to me shooting. Infantry controls don't work with the "fully supported" xbox controller (but do with vehicles) so I switched to mouse and keyboard for this despite configuring it beforehand for the controller. Aiming with the mouse is a challenge considering the mouse is inverted by default for some reason. I killed one of them, sprinted towards the nearest building, clipped through it and was instantly killed.\n\n2. Spawned as the chestical soldier again and, after slogging through the awful manual, figured out how to enter and drive a SUV with a machine gun ontop around the base. The controls are overly sensitive and incredibily awful. You have to directly target things if your vehicle has a free moving turret, instead of pivoting your mouse or something similar to manuver them around. I tried running people over but they just collect on your hood and get moved around. I shot at a giant yet noiseless patrolling tank a few times, with no reaction, then shot off into the desert by holding the "Down" direction on the left analog stick. The same stick the steering is controlled with, yeah, smart. The main developer, Derek Smart, didn't want anyone to see the truly awful level design outside of this base on Earth that also had truly awful level design, so the base defenses automatically started firing rockets at me as I drove far away from it. I drove over a lake, then into an ocean with my open-air car, and didn't drown even upon exiting. Since I had no idea where to go after spending about 10 minutes or more letting the car drive effortlessly over the oceanfloor, I quit the game and didn't bother looking at the rest of the game until the next day.\n\nI have never dealt with a more needlessly complicated system of learning how to do anything. Even tabletop games, which can be fairly complicated, are more readily available to learn than this "turn to page XYZ to even sort of understand what I'm talking about" nonsense. This might fly in the days of Wing Commander and such, but the draw of certain "old school" style game elements just doesn't exist anymore unless you're playing an enthusiast level flight simulator or something. Seriously, page 4 of the tutorial throws every single blinking light at you at once, gives it a dumb 3 letter combination, and says to pause the game and just stare at the UI for awhile. How is that intuitive, or learning anything as you're doing it? By comparison, Elite Dangerous has a similarly complicated UI, with a lot going on in front of you, as well as the need to access the computers on the right and left sides of you at times, but the tutorials are broken down into small scenarios focusing on the basics before anything complicated. Slapping together a couple integrated Word docs that tells you how to play is just lazy, plain and simple. Telling me "go here, fly around the target craft at half speed because I said so, then shoot at it but DON'T KILL IT OR YOU LOSE" is not intuitive. Wouldn't "Collector's Edition" imply you made some improvements to these clearly outdated systems? Or is this part of the code that was only touched in one day, as detailed on Twitter? How does telling us the equivalent of "only the commander really works" in the game description on Steam, then giving us a bad experience in that one single class, tell us that the full upcoming game will not be completely bad as well?\n\nI'm wearing headphones as I play this, and the crew randomly babbling things as soon as I jump into a ship makes me think this game is turning me into a schizophrenic. Is this the lost souls of those who played the game calling for me to join them in the underworld?\n\nThe controls are awful, and I'd like to re-emphasize that here. For example. instead of using the escape key to pause the game and display relevant background information like saving and such, there's 5 million different uses for Alt+*whatever key* instead. There's nothing in the key bindings of this game that screams "intuitive" or "well thought out". In fact, everything about this game's control scheme seems to indicate that it was designed to be played in the Eighth Circle of the underworld from Dante Alighieri's "Divine Comedy", alongside being whipped and having your body immersed in a lake of boiling pitch.\n\nThere may be some improvements I'm not aware of compared to the base game it originates from, but would you eat a turd if it has pink frosting and sprinkles on it? To me, and likely many others, this is just another failure of many attached to Derek Smart.","February 6, 2015","false","2.3"," 298 of 462 people (65%) found this review helpful 165 people found this review funny","65","298","462","165","8"

In fact, the only reason I would recommend even downloading it is because it's free.  As the saying goes, anything free is worth what it costs, and in this case, it is quite literally true.\n\nAnd don't buy the "bug-free" claim.  Many people experience crashes - but according to the developer, that's the player's fault for not having compatible hardware (which is often not the case), not his fault for failing to account for such possibilities.  Oh, and you can't Alt-Tab or it crashes - and again, nothing there but excuses from the developer.","February 19, 2015","false","5.2"," 62 of 81 people (77%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","77","62","81","10","0"

This will affect the inventory a station has to sell as well as the economy in general.\nNext you have raiders which are also randomly generated.\nThey will try to attack the aforementioned trade ships and thus their success/failure also affects inventory & economy of the stations.\nYou have :\n- Criminals being generated, with police being generated to pursue them.\n- Diplomats appearing and assassins dispatched to attack them.\n- Colonists & workers headed to uninhabited planets to build cities\n- Paramedics looking for the distress signals\nAnd of course rival military forces clashing in as chance encounters or as retaliation for some other transgression for which the player never witnessed.\n\nWhile you're docked in a station getting repairs a whole dammed war could be going on outside and given enough time nations that were allies in the beginning of the game can sometimes become enemies just by one incident that the player may have nothing to do with.\n\n*Overall:\nTo me Universal Combat is something very special: A vast simulation experiment with a game thrown in.\n\nI have been watching this game’s predecessor (the Battlecruiser series) since 1998 and in all that time I have seen nothing which comes close to it in terms of scope & scale.\nUC is a vast improvement on the old Battlecruiser series in every conceivable way and yet here it is being offered for FREE!?...Unbelievable.\n\nHowever as I said before it is not for everyone.","September 25, 2015","true","30.9"," 84 of 134 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","84","134","10","2"

That took me to the "create a profile" screen, so I did that and loaded up the "tutorial" scenario. Next I saw a "briefing" screen that gave me no direction other than "rtfm to learn how to play." Already I'm not thrilled with this "update." Next I got dropped into what feels like a cockpit with some pretty familiar-looking HUD elements. Since I recall (from the game's original incarnation) that the tutorial began with a ground mission, I assumed that I'm somehow meant to get myself down to the big red planet that's nearby.\n\nBefore too long, I get a message that says "urgent message received." Okay. Where's the message? Let's figure out which one of these buttons leads me to a place where I can read the urgent message. The only thing that seemed remotely useful to that end was "comms," which was within the "command" menu. But the comms screen is really just a log of what messages have already flashed up on screen. So all I see there is "urgent message received."\n\nOkay, whatever that urgent message is will have to wait; I need to get down to this planet. Oh look! A button marked "Shuttles." Surely, that will allow me to command my shuttles. Nope. It just opens a branching menu that lets me load the shuttle with... personnel I guess. I'm not sure, since there was nothing selectable anywhere in the tree. Okay, let's go back to the "command" menu tree. Hey look! Shuttles again! Let's launch a shuttle! Tell it to go to that planet!\n\nWait. There's nobody on the shuttle because there's nothing to select in the "shuttles" menu.\n\nThen my PC rebooted (which is in no way related to the game).\n\nSo... In my experience, a tutorial is something that's meant to teach you how to use something. This doesn't do that. Apparently, this is the scenario that's meant to accompany the 90-something-page tutorial novella.\n\nOkay. All done. Thanks Derek Smart for making me remember that your games are totally counter-intuitive and inaccessible, even to a guy who lives for complicated games that don't suffer from Monkey Syndrome. Admittedly, this game does not. It suffers from the reverse. Everything in this game seems to defy convention, seemingly for no reason but the defiance of convention.\n\nI confess myself pretty disappointed. I was really excited about this game when it was first released in 2004; back when I had the patience to pull it apart and figure it out. Even then I had a hard time with it. I was hoping that a "Collector's Edition" would at least have added a proper tutorial. Pretty disappointed.\n\nIf you played this game ten years ago and still remember how it works, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed with this new version. It seems like a really cool game; it's just entirely unapproachable. If you don't feel like reading a 90-something-page tutorial, don't bother with this one.\n\nIt's also nice to see Derek Smart is still totally uninsterested in what anyone thinks of his games. He made it for himself, so why should he care if anybody else can figure it out?","February 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 62 of 96 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","62","96","11","6"

Although you can play as a marine/fighter pilot/merchand/insurgent/...   the main focus of this game is to be in command of a big space carrier. And in this aspect it is brilliant. The games gives you the option of micromanaging every aspect of your ship, for example the traditional power distribution, but also shield strenght, weapons management, crew managent, control of your fighter squadron, the ability to send shuttles with marines to board enemy ships. The possibilities are endless.\nThere is a huge galaxy with planets and moons you can land on, bases to dock or destroy. You can mine ressources, trade, or just blow up ships. Either in free roam, or in a sort of campaign.\nBut so is the complexity of this game: Fighters need rearming and refuelling, crew needs to be assigned to pre-flight the fighters, your crew needs rest, it takes time to get them through the ship, If your damaged, ship systems must be repaired, these systems need various ressources and time to be repaired. Most of these functions will be done automatically, but you still need to check everything in a while.\nAs a result, the gameplay is slow. Engagements may take some time, sometimes your vital repairs need 30 minutes or more, your fighters won't be ready for the next 15 minutes.\nAnd the learning curve for this game is steep. The tutorial is not really all that helpful, the UI is complex and difficult to understand, and understanding this game is going to take a while.\nThe graphics are vary old, and can best be described as functional, but ugly. I experienced some crashes and some laggy UI in the crew management screen.\n\nSo, should you play this game?\nIf you are looking for some instant action, fast space dogfights or FPS action, then don't download it. Also, if you expect some sort of interesting campaign, you will be dissapointed. As this campaign only provides some missions via text messages.\n\nBut if you are looking for a great space carrier simulator, which gives you total freedom, a universe that reacts to your actions, and a really detailed and comlex ship systems, this game is for you. If won't be annoyed by old graphics, are able to form your own campaign in your mind, and are willing to invest a couple of hours to really learn the game before you even start to play it, then you will have some great ours of fun.\n\nIf you are not sure about it, then just try it, it's for free, but be aware that is is really difficult to get into.","February 7, 2015","true","2.9"," 179 of 328 people (55%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","55","179","328","18","2"

It's not "player friendly". Even myself, who like to read manuals before or when playing a video-game, am not motivated to read as many pages to play it, especially when seeing the negative returns of steam players.

I first decided I wanted to be a pilot, commanding a carrier, but the controls are rediculous, nothing makes any kind of sense in terms of usability. This games seems like it was made by someone who really wants to make a game, but has no idea how to begin, what to do, or what people like to see in their games.\n\nSo after flying around a bit, and shooting nothing as a commander. I restarted as a marine, thinking it would be fun to run around with a unit and kill enemies. Well enjoy the low low low res textures on the planets, everything is made from triangles, again, controls make no sense, I started off with inverted controls on the FPS portion, even the help screen which tells you controls doesn't seem to be comprehensive, is difficults to navigate, and exit the screen. The game is just terribly made, overly ambitious, delivering on almost nothing from a gamers perspective.\n\nWhen clicking on roam, about 1/4 of the time the game would immediately crash on me. I was unable to set the name of my ship, as clicking didn't seem to register on the Asset category. I can only shake my head at steam as I wonder who let this pile of crap go through.

Guess Third times the charm.\n- Changed screen resolution from 1024 x 768 (who the hell uses THAT anymore??) - crashed\n- Started up for the 4th time, seems it saved my screen res, but there was no 1920x1200, has to go with 1920x1080 :(\n- Made a character and decided to do some free roam, check it out.\n\nThe graphics on this game are extremely dated, I understand it came out in 2004, but BF2142 came out in 2006 and BLOWS this game away in terms of graphics. I would think for a "remastered collection" the dev would put a little time and money into updating the graphics. Seeing how this is the "spiritual successor to the infamous Battlecruiser series " I would not doubt at all if this uses the same engine and graphical assets. Figure after 10 years the dev would have solved the CTD after their logo....\n\nUI is clunky and in the end utter garbage. Controls make ZERO sense. Figured WASD would control the ship, nope. Had to use the arrow keys, but left and right only rolled the ship, had to use the Q and E keys to turn the shipr ather than roll it... Played for about 10 min, Alt+Tabbed to find this infamous Manual that comes with the game, only to have it crash on me.\n\nLoaded back in, tried to play more to give it a fair chance, the space was SO empty, I couldn't get over what looks like 8 bit graphics on the planets, with clouds that are whipping over entire continents in seconds, must be 25,000 mph winds on the surface.\n\nClaims to be a 3D space game, this is nothing but a lousy 2D UI over vaste empty space, total cheating. little or nothing 3D here.\n\nCouldn't find an easy way to access a menu, so I hit Alt+F4, To myn surprise that enabled mouse controled flight.. Who knew?? In the end, I felt I couldn't handle it, the graphics literally hurt my eyes. Still couldn't find a menu, ctrl+alt+delete... wtf, this is game is using 76% of my i7 at 3.6 gHz, and 6 gb of my ram....\n\nIn the end, I give this a 0/10, release a 10 year old game onto Steam as F2P then annouce $40 DLC for it...

The first thing you will see is an intro card with the developer's name (3000AD) in a very oddly shaped window (There's black bars at the top and bottom of the intro card). Then the game pops into fullscreen at the default resolution of... 1024x768... okay... I really don't know why so many games default to 4:3 resolutions when 16:9 is much more common, but whatever. Naturally, my next step was to find the options menu and change my resolution to something more palatable. The options menu itself is extremely awkward and disorganized (the audio options are directly beside the graphics options with no separation). After glaring at it for a minute or two (and noticing that there's no way to change key bindings or play in windowed mode), I finally find the resolution, click the right arrow affiliated with it several times until I got to 1920x1080. I maxed out all the rest of the graphics options, pressed save (nothing happened), then exited the options menu and... the game crashed.\n\nTake two, launch the game, watch the intro card again (since I'm not aware of a way to skip it), and at least the game saved my settings. Now, I can finally try to play the game. After looking through the menus for a bit, I find the tutorial scene, boot it up, and... well... the game started, I guess. I was provided with absolutely no information as to how to play the game or what I was supposed to be doing. I think the arrow keys change what direction your ship is going, or maybe just the direction you're facing, but I don't know. I tried messing around with it for a few minutes and couldn't figure out how to do anything. I couldn't even figure out how to quit the game (aside from tabbing out and forcing it to crash).\n\nFrom what I gathered, it's highly recommended that you read through the 90 page manual before you even run the damn game. Um... no. I have way better things to do with my time than read a rather lengthy manual on how to play a video game that so far has given me absolutely no reason to want to play it, especially if the tutorial document is going to insult my intelligence every step of the way.\n\nVERDICT The game's mechanics, gameplay, menus, UI design and tutorial (AKA the manual) are extremely archaic and don't hold up to modern standards of video games.\n\nAlso, apparently the developer stopped updating the free version of the game due to the negative reviews, so that's cool.","September 17, 2015","false","0.1"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","21","39","0","8"

Let me start off with saying that this game looks awesome when you get in. The potentail fun you can have looks pretty endless. My main problem with this game however was the fact it froze up on me often the most I actaully played was a handful of minutes. This may have just been my computer not having enough processing power or high enought specs to run this game which is a real possiblilty. Overall This review is just to say It looks great however If you cant play it after alot of tries I suggest you either change your computer or move on. This game did not appear to have many people with this problem as when i searched for any forum or information board with a solution I could'nt find much. Great looking game however if you cant really play it I dont recommend it.\n\nKinda obvious but thats my two cents.\nPlease keep in mind this doesn't mean its a bad or good game I just can't judge the gameplay much yet.\n\n\nThis is a addition to this review: the game has recorded me playing it for 40+ hours and I know for a fact I have not played that much.","February 8, 2015","false","43.5"," 30 of 57 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","30","57","2","1"

I really would. I actually really enjoy it. I can't, though. I think there's something to be said about the hivemind downrating the living hell out of this game. It really boils down to poor explanation and implementation.\n\nThe idea behind the game is fantastic, moreso that Smart actually more or less accomplished the scope of the game. Its the ultimate space adventure - command a super carrier complete with awesome offensive weaponry, crew, fighter pilots, and marines. Launch invasions of planetary bases from orbit, or make planetfall and glass the damn thing yourself.\n\nWhen you get to the knitty gritty, though, that's what things start to fall apart. How the hell do I fly this thing? Alright, lemme dig up this 99 page manual... which, lets be real - I love a game with depth but I'm not in school and I'm not here to read a fat-♥♥♥ manual. Not everybody is like me, either, and won't spend hours of frustration learning it the 'fun' way. They'll just give up, instead. Which they do. I think a proper tutorial would go a long way to explaining to the player what they need to know.\n\nThe controls feel awfully stiff, too. Spacecraft don't really fly like spacecraft... or aircraft, for that matter. Rolling in atmosphere doesn't change your heading at all, and your yaw authority is waaay higher than it should. Add in a fudged up sense of scale (good luck hitting something moving that fast) and atmospheric combat is nigh impossible except between capital ships.\n\nI won't even get into the ground combat. It certainly has it. What little I've experienced of it is enough for me to know I can't review it without sounding scathing.\n\nIts a shame. I want to give this a thumbs up. I've actually had fun learning how to play it, and if it were just the learning curve I'd say don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥ and go right in. Sadly, its more than that, and for that I have to give Smart a failing grade.","March 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","3"

I know i know, I haven't even played it for 45 min. Like i said, you have to read ALOT of stuff and memorize alot of commands. So why am i recommending this game? I may not like it but i don't hate on a game just cause i don't like it. I can tell alot of effort was put into this game and the realisim is actually there. Think if you will, you just take command of a ship. Your not going to know immediately how the hell to work everything, so you have to read the manual. It's not like most space games where you fly to a planet and you immediately request docking clearence then get accepted and dock all in a few min. You yourself have to request clearence then wait for a response and if you're cleared then you can land. The shields aren't always magically on, you have to turn them on. Basically this game has zero hand holding when it comes to the controls. You have to sit there and read them then try them out and memorize them. Don't be like me, i made the mistake of turning of my ships main reactor and everyone died :(  (still can't believe i did that). The point is this  is an actual space simulation game and i gotta applaude the creator for this. Most realistic space sim ever. But just not for me. So if you want, yes you have to WANT, to sit through a long manual and memorize the controls this is the game for you. If you want to actually be in command of your own ship where you must do everything yourself, this is the game for you. If you want a true space sim game, this is definetly the game for you.

Another point: this game is an indie game. No big studio behind it, but as an indie game, like many indie games, it tries to do something original and outside the "generic" genre of games we have to pick from all too often. But this game, specifically, *to-date*, there are very few games that yet to come anywhere close to what it has accomplished.\n\nDid I mention this is an old game? It's also a very complicated game. There is a very helpful tutorial and manual.\nI put a lot of emphasis on the word SIMULATOR. This is not Wing Commander or Freelancer.\nThis is like Jane's F-15 or Falcon 3.0 type overly-complicated simulator games back in the day.\n\nAny fan of the prior games will feel at home if they had mastered the controls.\nThe controls take getting used to, but the GUI/mouse interface let's you do most things from the HUD alone now.\nYou can mouse to the shields to raise lower, or partially, or mouse to the MFD displays and toggle various modes if you don't want to use the Hot-Keys.\n\nWhat do you do this in this game? Whatever you want. Pick a "career type" which pretty much establishes what ships you can opt to start out with and where and who your enemies will be; and then launch into space.\nYou micromanage your crew, ship, supplies, but once you get the hang of the controls, you'll appreciate it, there is a lot you can do and a lot of you can keep track of and you might be surprised.\n\nRemember in Star Trek, the captain might want to take a shuttle down to a planet to explore and take some bridge crew or officers or whoever with him?\n\nYOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nYou can make personnel report to a shuttle, leave your mothership, fly to some planet way over HERE or THERE, actually fly down to the surface. From there, you can deploy a mining drone, or go take one of your combat vehicles for a spin, or get out and go for a stroll. What to do on the planet? Not much, mining is important and useful. OR, you can go to a city or base and blow it up. The sheer fact you can do this in the game is great. The game doesn't have a fancy polish and I'm sure some will be offput by the execution of some of the features. This an old game, complicated, indie title, so it might feel clunky, shoddy, but it works (no CTDs for me so far). Some people will think going to planets is boring, seems desolate, but I don't know any other game where that is different (take Evochron: Mercenary for example which is quite bare-bones gameplay wise).\n\nOnce you launch your ship for the first time, you might say: UH OK, now what.\nThis is no X, this is no Elite:Dangerous, but let's you still do a hell of alot more, and as such, the game leaves a lot open to the imagination.\n\nPROS:\n-Familiar controls for those fans of the series\n-Good ship designs\n-Lots of things to do, manage crew, track their movements, keep your ship supplied, managed craft\n-Tons of interface screens, TACOPS lets you play in a sort of RTS style (can't control mouse/seemless zoom style, its a bit different but useful); when in doubt, use the TACOPS feature, it will become your friend.\n-Land on planets, deploy vehicles, run around like an idiot shooting everything (fun)\n-Not much to do on planets except mine and shoot everything (lol) or just explore it (cuz it's there!)\n-Very detailed HUD, MFD's, if you are micromanager and want to know everything, this is it.\n-Non-NPC spawning mode so newbies can tinker around with the game who otherwise might get ♥♥♥♥♥ out the door for the first time\n-Improved graphics\n-Space Combat feels streamlined, and its rewarding when your starship goes up against another and you blow them and their support ships to pieces\n-The HUD display with MFDs you can pull up in FPS mode is awesome, can scan for all sorts of targets. This is the kind of detail I like in games.\n-I found the AI more responsive in this incarnation. I ejected from my starship and my ship flew off. Went to TACOPS, ordered it me, and to halt. It responded very well. In maybe BC3K v1.0 or 2.0 it might ignore me and fly 1,000,000,000,000,000 km away (my bad for not preparing the AI a/p mode in advance, oops LOL).\n-You can control just about everything with your mouse through the HUD because it is interactve (so you don't have to rely on hot-keys)\n-As an older game, graphics performance is good even on lower end computers these days\n-You'll have lots of great and sometimes stories to tell others about your adventures/events that happen in the game (shut down launch bay power due to intruders on board, assigned marines to guard shuttles, intruder managed to fight them, steal a shuttle with injured marine on board I had to go chase after lol)\n-IT'S FREE!\n\n\nCONS:\n-Can't re-bind keys\n-You'll need to study the controls and features, require some patience\n-Control customization is limited\n-Controls will take non-veterans of the series sometime to master (not that hard ones you get used to it)\n-I miss from BC:M being able to walk on the hull of any space object (Star Trek: First Contact-style)\n-Intruders beaming aboard with shields up still a random nusiance.\n-BIGGEST GRIPE: Jumping to a target, especially star bases, leaves you too far away, ships fly too slow, and there is no afterburner/turbo boost mode like in the past versions of the game---sorely needed so you don't spend seemlingly forever trying to cover that last stretch like a turtle. Not too bad with enemy ships but mostly with stations. There is a cheat option that lets you go beyond your ship's limits and can be used as a quasi-afterburner mode though.\n-It shows its age, not really a problem for me, but the planet graphics seemed to be the weak link, had to fly almost touching the ground just to start seeing trees, horizon looks messed up, and didn't see any graphics options to increase view distance\n-FPS was rather glitchy when near 3D objects, some areas lack polish (not Polish)\n-This game will fry the brain of anyone with ADD. LOL.\n\n\nRemember, this game is very detailed and complicated.\n\nIt's sort of like a combination of Evochron:Mercenary and X, but not nearly as polished and feels more complicated, the trade off being you can do a 100x more things. Ultimately, those games still don't come close to the same versatile free-form gameplay or possessing so many options. There is a trade-off and with UC:CE because it tries to do it all and give the players greater control/options.\n\nI expect a good number of people will say "this let's you do SO MUCH but I only wish it was implemented better".\nIt is an ACQUIRED TASTE. Like when you have your first beer or wine, or shot of liquor, you're like "ewww, so bitter! why do people even drink this?!" but before you know it, you become a connoisseur.\n\nThe developer had a great vision and it's too bad some people have expections like this is Call of Duty in Space or some crap. The game is fairly unique (and FREE through Steam), it has been around a long time for that reason and it has a supportive fanbase through the years; the developer still works to support his vision of this franchise and build upon it after all these years, and that is appreciated.","March 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 32 of 67 people (48%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","48","32","67","7","1"

They all are fine but there you always command what is effectively a fighter.  And if you came to UC with the same assumption you will, you were, sorely disappointed.\n\nThe UC is not for everyone.  First off, you *have* to Read That F*ing Manual, period.  Otherwise you will not know not just how to do what you are supposed to do, but even what you are supposed to do in first place.  And you are supposed to no less than to take care of your SHIP, a spaceship.  With her crew, equipment, armament, subsystems and so on, all while cruising through the emptiness of space.  It's not like it's SpaceCimCity.  It's more like being in shoes of Captains Kirk, Picard or Janeway.  The level of micromanagement is overwhelming at the beginning but in time I found it lands in my personal sweet spot where it is enough of it to keep the game engaging and not enough of it to be bogged down.\n\nIf you prefer quick fast paced action you may want to stay away from this game, that's fine.  Though if you want to have the feeling of being actual captain, give it a chance despite the learning curve.  Besides, every skip' had to learn his ropes, and it always took time.\n\nP.S. I have clocked so little here just because nowdays I don't have that much time to play this game.  But I had spent my deal playing earlier versions starting from BC3K, through BCM and ending on non-Steam UC.  I wish I could play it more but alas, priorioties and obligations IRL.","April 10","true","0.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","7","17","2","16"

Once past that stage, the game can be truly appreciated for its massive scope and the freedom it gives the player as a captain of a huge spaceship. The sense of scale is exceptional  - I sometimes land my 1 km carrier at a planet only to go outside and walk besides it, or go for an EVA near a huge star station and zoom out. This is awesome stuff  (yes even if the first person mode is less than stellar. But then this is mostly a space sim and a unique one at that).\n\nI must say I actually find this game pretty. It is dated, but the lighting, textures and models are very nice and atmospheric (see my screenshots). The design of the ships looks realistic with visible launch bays, bridge, etc. Being mostly a hard core flight simmer I like these small touches.\n\nIn the Captain career, being able to manage the crew, the ships resources and smaller crafts (fighters and shuttles) appeals to me a lot and I don't think it can be done at this level in other games. There is plenty of stuff to do in the huge galaxy in roam mode - trading, space combat, mining, planet ops...\n\nI can also say stability has improved since the initial Steam release and it is not an issue anymore. And I have been playing quite a lot lately.\n\nIf you like space sims and aren't afraid complex games ignore the bashing and give it a try. Truly highly recommended.\n\n(PS I'm looking forward to the added features of the DLC, especially the 3D bridge - that sounds like a blast).","August 13, 2015","true","64.4"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","15","34","4","7"

This game is awesome.  It does have a learning curve, it can get confusing, and if you're afraid of a little light reading, it's probably not for you.  Don't expect to be able to jump in and fumble your way through figuring out what button does what, and be blasting ships out of the cosmos in five minutes.  This isn't Halo.  It's a simulator, and the effort and energy went into allowing you to control and actively manage a huge spaceship, it's crew, and to play with the most dynamic and brilliantly crafted AI I've ever seen.  The graphics and sound effects are not as pretty as others, like Evochron, but despite that, the immersion and enjoyment I personally experience from this game rivals that of GTA 5.  It's an open universe, and you can pretty much do whatever you want.  And though it's not as pretty, there is a lot more of this game to experience than any of it's "competition" in the space sim genre.  If you intend to try this game, which I recommend you do, judge it after you complete the tutorial, and realize that this game is an iceburg.","June 17, 2015","true","132.0"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","9","25","3","2"

Derek Smart deserves credit for sticking to his guns, and sticking with this game. Universal Combat isn't pretty, easy or intuitive. But it's still an unmatched capital ship simulator with an unforgiving '90s-style attitude.\n\nThis game will not hold your hand (tip: read the manual) or tuck you into bed at night. It's definitely not for everybody. It's about outer space and it wants to kill you. It's a sandbox with the complexity of hardcore naval sims such as Silent Hunter.\n\nIt's about logistics, space battles, crew management, reactor meltdowns and nuking cities from orbit. You will be boarded, ransacked and the perpetrators will escape in a stolen shuttlecraft.\n\nYour ship will be set adrift while on fire.\n\nWhy Universal Combat Matters\nI didn't discover this game until recently. I've known about Smart since the early 2000s, but dismissed him and didn't give him a chance. He was a joke, a crank, his games were bad. That's what I thought, but in reality I didn't understand him.\n\nNow I do ... I think.\n\nSmart is foremost an engineer, as this game reflects an engineer's mindset. It's about spaceships, but it's really about complex systems, taking things apart and figuring out how they work. This has its downsides: Engineers are not celebrated for their empathy and they don't make for great artists.\n\nBut engineers do make great systems.","December 15, 2015","true","29.3"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","35","9","26","5","1"

If this available to mod I can see this game getting a large fans base to put lots of time into it by many.\n\nSure it may not be the latest graphics, but it takes a real gamer to see past that at first to what it can become. but that is what a fan base is for! a following and group of people to enhance it IF allowed!!!\n\nLook at all the lastest games typical giving up the game creation foundation to look and feel like the compeditor games. after awhile they all look the same, play the same, and no real defining point to stand out. IMHO UC seems to hold on to its original fundamental game base it came from.

Already we have taken out two enemy cargo ships and an insurgent light cruiser. But when we ran up against an Engstrom, it was all our Warhammer could do to hold off their fighters and get past their laser system to catch up and make the kill.\n\nWe have damage on all decks, intruders on board, and a third of our marines are dead with more headed to sick bay. We are attempting to land on a moon for repairs and to lay low for a bit. Don't worry; we'll be back.\n\nUniversal Combat is something of a trip in to the past, and anyone playing it needs to realize that. When I first played this way-back-when, it was probably the most absolutely complicated game I had ever attempted to play, and 14-year-old me really liked having to figure everything out as I went along and really learn how to play this thing. And frankly, that's where the satisfaction is. Universal Combat hails from a time when games really didn't tell you how good you were doing. There were no 'atta-boys. The satisfaction came from realizing that you had figured the game out and were getting good at it.\n\nI suggest giving this a try and playing it for at least 6 hours before deciding if you like it or not. I personally enjoy the challenge of not just moment-to-moment ship management, but of the long term planning you can really get in to when determining either a brief patrol of border space or an extended campaign in to enemy territory. What spare parts should I take? Where should I deploy mining drones for resupply? Where can I park for repairs? And I do mean park for repairs; if you make poor choices and take damage, you realistically could be down for hours. It's brutal. But coming through several of those limp-home-and-pray adventures is what builds the narrative in your head and really helps you get in to the game, I think. I might not be able to follow my marine security detail around while they hunt down saboteurs, but damn if I don't stare at the PERSCAN screen and yell obscenities at them anyways.\n\nIt's not polished, it's not perfect. You'll have complaints. But if you give it a real chance and keep an open mind, you'll probably never forget playing it, and you'll have a totally different sort of fun with it than you do with Planetside 2 or Smite. And hopefully you'll stick around for Derek's next project, because I have a feeling it should be pretty cool.","September 10, 2015","true","26.0"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","8","24","3","0"

Yes, it had a troubled release back in 1996 but blame Gametek for that one.  There's not another game in existence that creates this kind of immersive world in a fully modeled futuristic starship along with planetary surfaces, planetary bases, space stations, and moons.  I can land my ship, or take a shuttle, or beam down the surface for a leisurely stroll across a beach or I can drop in with my Marines for a full blown assault on an enemy base.\n\nOr I can just hang out on my bridge and "nuke the site from orbit."\n\nAnd that's the endless possibilities of free roam.  I haven't touched on the scripted campaign which can be tough as nails but incredibly fun and rewarding.  The massive space stations that will blow you to pieces with a burst of their weapons, the fact that I can hop into a fighter and duke it out while my capital ship supports me.\n\nOh, there's also fleet command and control, trading, capturing starstations, ship to ship combat, trading, mining, powerful artifacts that can turn your ship from kick-butt to kick-♥♥♥♥-and-take-names-without-breaking-a-sweat style.\n\nThis game is complex and it requires some time investment to learn the concepts and the systems.  If it helps, think of this game as "Falcon 4.0" in space only you aren't flying an F-16 but a half mile long starship with fighters, shuttles, marines, landing craft.  There's a plethora of resources from a well-written manual, tutorial videos, and in game help but make no mistake this is a game that will require some learning but its oh so rewarding.\n\nDon't let my steam playtime fool you, I started playing this game in 1998 with the release of BC3K 2.0 and I can safely say that in the past 17 years no other game has come close to doing what this one does.  If you want to be in command of a futuristic starship (don't think Captain Kirk....this ain't no wimpy Enterprise...more like William Adama) with entire fleets to command and stations to blow up and planetary surfaces to fight on then this game is for you.\n\n","May 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 13 of 35 people (37%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","37","13","35","3","2"

You may see reviews on here saying there is no tutorial, well there is a tutorial free roam scenario designed to be played along with a written tutorial document included. This is a game from the days when you had to read a whacking great manual and tackle a learning curve that was very steep. Once it is learned, however, it opens up a whole galaxy to explore and a myriad of options and things to do. Want to fly around the galaxy looking for a fight? It's here. Want to land troops on a planet with tanks and fighter planes to assault an enemy stronghold? That's here too. Want to take control of those vehicles on the planet surface and get stuck in yourself? Yep you can! You can even land your huge capital ship on any planet/moon and get out for a stroll around taking in the sights. There's trading and mining here as well as salvage from destroyed ships, towing ships in distress to a star station for help, real time movement of crew around the ship, full control of power distribution to all systems on your ship, teleporter to transport men/cargo down to a planet surface, and evac them from the planet and so much more.\n\nThis game has it all from capital ship command to slugging it out on planets or even the hull of your ship in first person mode, naval vessels and space fighters which can also be flown in the planet's atmosphere to support your ground troops.\n\nAll this from an indie dev team in the early noughties! The version here on Steam is an overhauled and remastered version of the original 2009 Collectors Edition and to have it here for free is nothing short of amazing. What have you got to lose?

It barely ran on my laptop but I digged it.\nThe new laptop I have today runs this version pretty well, better than I ever dreamed.\n\nI have not run into the old bugs yet, but having identified them in the past it's easy to dodge them until they are fixed.\nI have been looking for a space sim like this one but they are always too advanced for the hardware that I currently have.\nBUT not this one.\n\nEnder's Game was an excellently written book.  The author started saying it is he who writes and I who fills the void with the imagination and every reader gets a different story in their minds but it is a story crafted along with the author.  I get that a lot with UC.\n\nTake a battlecruiser mk. 3 -- a magnificent looking vessel -- and engage any ship you want.  Be anyone you want to be.\nEven the boring people.\n\nIt was a vast game with lots of complexities that Starpoint Gemini 2 only barely scrapes the surface of with its ship captures and boardings.  This game, long before SG2, had all that and more.   No, this game is not as "user friendly" as SG2 (and that was also a complicated game -- WITH GRINDING), but this game has no grinding.  You get whatever you want and roll with it from the get go.\n\nIt's like a gigantic permadeth rogue-like space sim, and it was awesome.\nYes there are the bugs, but the game was epic so I endured.\n\nPeople hate it because, I am guessing, it was too much work for them to read Derrek Smart's highly entertaining manuals-- where else would you get someone joking about political correctness in a game manual?  Most people want to dive right in, and subsequently when they are overwhelmed they bug out and complain because that is natural for self-entitled people these days (millions of them) to do.\n\nOnce you master the game, what is there to do?\nWell, whatever you want to be honest.\n\nIs there any story, any girl to rescue?  A sex scene like in the movies?\nWell, there is a story if you chose one.  There are women in the game.  But if I wanted to watch awesome sex scenes I'd break out some porn or surf the web.\n\nDestroying ships or fighters and running to live another day like a good old pirate is awesome enough for me, especially because I do not have to GRIND for my Battlecruiser mk.3!\n\nThe game is unforgiving but it always had potential and I am surprised and glad to see D.Smart is still at it with this game and I hope he keeps at it.\n\nHaters are going to hate.\nLet them, they are missing out on a great gem here.\n\n\n","July 5, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","28","5","18","3","1"

They have improved the coding to the point that you no longer crash the game by hitting random key combinations; so that's a start. The Idea behind Universal Combat (Or *any* 3000ad game for that matter) is a space combat simulator on the highest degree of gameplay mechanics; Unforunately this means their games often are overly complex and Universal Combat CE is no exception.\nI'd give it a numerical rating but there's just no point because the game is so "oranges" to the market "apples".\nI'll say this: As long as it's free it's worth giving a shot, just don't pay a dime for it.\n\n\nNow onto why I don't like 3000ad as a whole:\n\nBack when the name of this game was Battlecruiser Millenium, because let's face it it's the same basic game, they promised "Multiplayer" for the retail version; I was foolish and bought the retail versions of both Battlecruiser 3000AD (the original) and BCM (the "sequel") after being disappointed by the revelation that they were not going to include multiplayer at all I realized I had been betrayed; but this was not the end of the story - it was the beginning: 5 years later by random chance I stumbled upon the 3000AD Homepage, where after having a look around I discovered that they had made Both BC3000AD and BCM freeware in just 4 short years after release; furthermore the site went on to claim that the games were outdated and Universal Combat would soon replace them, I held little hope after all this time but redownloaded the now Freeware BCM, and watched the site for Universal Combat - Initially they decided Universal Combat to be a "For Pay" product but that was not something I was willing to risk after being betrayed twice. So...I waited 2 more years, only to find the game "Universal Combat" pop-up on the Steam Free-to-Play List; I was extactic, except when I learned they had "Removed" the multiplayer in the freeware version and further research suggested that it may not have even existed in the first place. Now some 4 years beyond that I sit down to write the review on what I've seen, and something irks me - the original UC:CE didn't have an "online" button on the menu, but BCM did when it was Retail, neither one can click it but the BCM one was removed from the splash screen sometime after I bought it. Naturally I tried clicking it but it seems things have changed little - they still retire their software to freeware every 2 - 4 years, and they still remove the online functiionaliity (if it even had any - BCM they plain showed us up) that existed in the game. Wiith this pattern I will never betray myself by buying another piece of 3000AD Software; Still the games they make are good for solo-play, but what good is this kinda game if you can't enjoy it with friends?\n\nTL/DR: This company releases *all* it's software as freeware 2 - 4 years after release - Don't waste your money.","July 28, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","21","3","14","4","3"

It's complex, more similar to Eve Online or to a naval sim.  There's a lot to learn that's not presented to you nor obvious.  So if you are into hardcore military sims and have time to put into it, universal combat might be well worth your time.\n\nYou can begin your military career either with a mission-based tour of duty('acm'), or start in 'roam' mode where you are free to do whatever you wish in the open world.\nNumerous instant action scenarios are also present.\nRoam mode especially should be used in a roleplay mindset, so reading the game lore will greatly enhance the experience.\n\nOther than fighting your faction enemies and completing acm missions, your might also venture in the usual trading/mining/salvaging/bountyhunt/pirating businesses.\nYou'll be able to capture enemy bases in both space and planets, give orders to fleets of AIs, and your own crew AI will improve making them more effective in their duties.\n\n\n\nSTRONGLY RECOMMENDED READING:\n\n-manual appendix (linked at http://steamcommunity.com/app/345580/discussions/0/606068060824451693/ ), which contains descriptions of all ingame items and places, and essential game lore.\n\n-battlecruiser faq http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/566167-battlecruiser-3000-ad-20/faqs/24935\nIt's an old faq but still applies, and it has an essential walkthrough of the first campaign.","August 22, 2015","true","78.1"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","9","27","3","0"

It does not support Alt-Tab, and windowed mode is available but not really supported.\n\nUPDATE 11 hours in: The game is very stable. Crashed only once and I could not replicate conditions.\n\nAs for the game, it is not self contained, meaning that you must read the manual and possibly do the tutorial. This game is an acquired taste and involves a lot of knowledge and study.\n\nThis game is not really about you dogfighting, even if you can take a planetary defense fighter and pilot it. The meat of the game is the capital ship. Crew management (it simulates where each crew member is and what they are doing, even if you can't walk inside the ship) and other internal management of a capital ship, including a fighter squadron. You can be boarded, coordinate ground operations, pilot shuttles or fighters of your carrier, use orbital missiles, take over enemy space stations and explore a universe that, while not as large as Elite: Dangerous, will take you a long time to explore.\n\nMultiple races and occupations will change the game dynamic. There are military carriers, science vessels, trade ships, small fighters and more!\n\nAs for the Campaign, I never had much interest in it. I rather take a Battlecruiser MK3 and roam around the universe with a reduced risk of court martial.\n\nI always had a lot of fun with this game. Maybe this is the one game that inspired me to become a game developer, even if not the best game I ever played.

However i enjoyed trying to figure out the controls and i loved how complicated it was. Honestly for a 2004 game its pretty dam good, though the lack of tutorial makes it difficult.  I found it amusing for a while, Maybe ill look at this game later on when the new version with good graphics is out, Hopefully still free, Because honestly it would be a waste of money to buy a game like this unless your willing to spend time to learn how to play it.\n\nPros-\nAdvanced Controls\nOpen World Type\nProbably one of the best space simulators ive seen\n\nCons-\nGraphics are pretty terrible, but it is a 2004 game\n97 Page Manual is not fun to read\nThe Controls are a bit wacky, I mean holding shift to go up and down? I would rather use the shifts for changing speed.\n\n\nNeutrals/Recommendations\nI suggest some kind of spaceship builder when the new game is coded, Itll appeal to more people\nKeep the new game free, It would be better to gain reputation off a game like this then money\nAdd more scenarios\nAdd a dam tutorial\nMake the 97 page manual a bit smaller with only 1 keybind to get to it.\n\nLets admit its pretty bad, But it has good potentional, Good coding behind it, and of course the lovely advanceness","February 6, 2015","true","0.3"," 20 of 59 people (34%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","34","20","59","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmdrmctosh/recommended/345580/","cmdrmctosh","Commander McTosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmdrmctosh/","30 products in account","This game is easy, anyone who thinks it's hard to play is a total ♥♥♥♥♥ and the kind of person who would have trouble playing Tetris.\n\nWanna jump someone? Click where and press shift-9. Ohh so difficult. Morons.\n\nFor those with less brain cells than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ goldfish you can always just alt-H and read the manual.\n\nWith that said, this game is so unbelievably fun. It shows its age, sure. But I'd take gameplay over graphics. [Edited out the AI remark, as this remastered version that problem seems to have been fixed)\n\n\nIt'd be fun if you could communicate with other ships in your sector too, or in roam mode if they had random events like a ship calling an SOS or picking up a VIP etc.\n\n\nBut as a space capital ship combat simulator, this is top dog #1, when you do actually find an enemy ship that wants to attack you it can be intense. Especially since your crew members' AI improves and grows overtime, as you also improve nad grow your commander skills. This makes the fights even more intense.\n\n\nRemember not to engage enemies more smarter than your crew, your pilots, marines etc, they all need to grow their AI skills overtime.\n\n\nI bought this in 2009 when it came out but just downloaded this remastered version out of curiosity, I'm going to go play it now.\n\n\nFor people who say it's buggy etc they're all lying. I've only seen ONE bug in this game, and that's when you click on a stargate or ship sometimes it 'unclicks' and you have to click on it again and that can get pretty annoying but it's hardly gamebreaking. Never had it crash on me or anything.\n\n\nSome tips for newbies:\n\n\n-Disable flight launch if you aren't launching. If you get intruders on board they'll run off with your cargo.. and shuttles/fighters!\n\n\n-Use perscan when you have marines on board, and assign them accordingly. ALways PREP FOR COMBAT.\n\n\n-Upgrade your REACTOR before you upgrade your engine.\n\n\n-Buy at GALCOM and sell at MAJORIS\n\n\n-Deploy mining drones on seperate moons/planets. Not only does this make it easier for you to keep track of which shuttle is picking up which drone, but also you get a wider variety of minerals. (Sell at Majoris)\n\n\n-If you see static on your HUD.. CLOAK AND RUN. If you don't have cloak then EMD AND RUN. It's a cloaked enemy ship, possibly fleet, and if they're cloaking it means their AI is probably higher than your crews AI so they WILL get on board or open fire if you don't get out of there. It'll be days, possibly even weeks, before your crew has the skills to take on such an enemy.\n\n\n-Don't attack starbases without a fleet or without friendly nearby ships also attacking.\n\n\n-Regularly stock up on RADINE, PLUTONIUM, NUTRIPAKS\n\n\n-Keep your turrets at 60%, guns at 30% and shields at 25% to conserve energy. Raise shields when enemy is around. Guns should be fine unless you're outnumbered, they're pretty powerful even at those %'s.\n\n\n-Regularly send out a shuttle with the "Cargosweep" order. They'll sweep your current & surrounding sectors for ejected cargo pods full of goodies. Be careful though, some pods are booby trapped.\n\n\n-Beam Resnig down onto the most volanic, vile planet you can find.\n\n\n-Keep playing. This is not a fast-paced game. To see any real progress it will take days, not hours.","February 8, 2015","true","161.2"," 23 of 69 people (33%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","33","23","69","9","1"

If you ever dreamed of being in command of a space battleship then you should give this game a try. I spent many nights flying through the galaxy role playing as Captain Julian Augustus, Battlecruiser Commander and I can't wait to get a free weekend or three to give it another go.\n\nThis game is very complex and and takes a while to learn to play it. This game is originally from a time when PC games came in a box and included a detailed and lengthy manual. These manuals were often a treat and included background information, cool artwork, a written tutorial, list of commands, etc. I miss those types of manuals.\n\nThe tutorial is a PDF file that you print out or read on a tablet while you play through the tutorial scenarios.  I'd recommend doing that. And print out the command reference as well or keep it open on a tablet.\n\nThe main thing to understand is that this game is deliberately complex. It is designed for someone who wants to feel like they are commanding a real battleship. To get the most out of this game you have to learn to play it and you have to use your imagination and really get into the role playing and the simulation. If you treat it like an arcade style game you're going to get frustrated.","February 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 54 people (30%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","30","16","54","6","0"
