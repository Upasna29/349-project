I kid you not.\n\nDay one, I found an exploit and two major bugs that could have wrecked the game. I pointed them out on the game forum. Day two, they were gone. The very next day I pointed out a couple interface anomolies, such as highlighting the slots where you place pieces of armor. Day three, they were gone. I pointed them out, and within the next six hours a patch arrived that addressed *minor* annoyances, and let me assure you they were minor--this is a pre-release game. I did not expect it to run well on my PC. I did not expect it without bugs.\n\nNo, I expected it to be a good game that required polish. Apparently, ONE designer did this whole game! If that's not polish, I'm not sure how teams of 17+ can complain. As far as gameplay, this is Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines meets Diablo, as other reviewers have pointed out. What they have not pointed out is the nuances of dungeon crawling, such as secrets to be discovered, minor puzzles, and side areas nobody gets to discover. They even have lockpicking, keys, doors that require opening, and traps for the unwary adventurer. See? Diablo, this is not. It comes across as a homage to World of Darkness, in its raw form, but streamlined down to a very narrow interface which is easy-to-learn, hard-to-master. If you like vampires.\n\nIf you like dark fantasy.\n\nIf you like traditional fantasy.\n\nIf you like MMOs.\n\nIf you like RPGs.\n\nIf you like sci-fi.\n\nIf you like Chinese soap operas.\n\nIf you like dhampires.\n\nIf you like your mother.\n\nHell, if you like anything about PRE-release gaming, or even just gaming in general, BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY. If I could hold ten thumbs up I would! I can only hope the game progressively gets better from here. I feel I have gotten my full money's worth. A cinema ticket costs less! Seriously. Buy it! Games deserve this type of dev support. That's even without the synergy, and gameplay balance, here--that combine to make this video game more than the sum of its parts.\n\nEven in its pre-release form, this is shaping up to be a visceral, and pulse-pounding (forgive the pun) experience. No kidding! Buy.\n\nJust. Click. It.\n\nEDIT: I have just gotten into the city areas. I will continue this review as I go. As it stands, the dev support alone has me sold on that movie theater ticket. ;)\n\nUPDATE 9/27/2015 (Shortly after Release):\n\nI cannot update my original opinions without altering the original review, so as of now, the visuals lack, but the gameplay is nicely polished. It adds up to a more action oriented experience than Bloodlines, but with more depth and sophistication than Diablo. I would ding it slightly for not being as polished as a commercial release, but that is where that ends. In spite of graphics, this is a monumental achievement for one man. For the price of a movie ticket, you get a first-person Diablo, in a World of Darkness-type setting, that nails gameplay and displays polish. Please note this is an independent release, and I think the price tag nicely suits it, though I would have paid $29.95 for the gameplay I got out of it, minus that other games are now haunting my time (Beware of Steam sales!) In conclusion, I would not buy it purely for boredom, but it is one of those "in-between" games where you can engage your RPG addiction before moving onto the dozen or so commercial releases stacked in your library. I would nicely rank it 8/10. Maybe an 8.5 if you like vampires or ARPGs.","April 21, 2015","true","19.5"," 129 of 139 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","129","139","14","2"

The graphics are really dated, the writing/script is generally bad, the characters are awkward (the player character's totally goofy flashlight pose almost turned me off from getting the game altogether), you use a flashlight despite being a nocturnal predator, the voice acting is painful most of the time, combat is awkward, and the equipment system makes you look utterly ridiculous (my PC is running around in a metal vest, goggles and a tophat with a medieval spiked morning star. I'd feel awkward at a cosplay event in that costume, let alone as an immortal predator.. if I weren't Malkavian).\n\nBut someone has needed to make this game for a long time. Since Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, in fact.\n\nThere are several things this game does which no other game has even attempted. The first is the lineage system. You can bite humans, turn them into your undead servants, and then have them act as your bodyguard or send them to check the pockets of your fallen enemies for you. You can even get them to bite other humans, creating a lineage of Vampires with you at the center. This is a very simple idea, but awesome. A Vampire game where you can actually have minions? Yes, please.\n\nIt has its own form of a politics system. There are a handful of Vampire clans and your standing with each one determines what kinds of supernatural powers you can develop (and other things).\n\nThe powers are well-thought out and enjoyable and, most importantly, very different. They're what carry the game, from a design standpoint. You have the mobility of a Vampire, able to jump great distances... past traps or upwards 15 feet to reach beyond human bounds. You can turn to mist and walk through gates and fences, you can summon a will o wisp to trip levers or scout around corners for you... and many other things.\n\nEach of the three classes (warrior, thief, mage) has its own starting power options, but you can theoretically learn any 'class' during a single playthrough since it's only constrained by stats and your reputation with the clans.\n\nAnd, since the powers are diverse, interesting (even game-changing in some cases), and broken up by the political system, you need to cultivate favor with certain clans to get access to the really good stuff.\n\nWhile everything else about the game can be off-putting, it does include a number of innovative desgins which I'd really like to see more often, and which I have no problems supporting. Although there are a lot of things I don't like about the game, I've been waiting for a long time for a Vampire game where you can pick up some alcohol-sodden bum, give him a battle axe and a taste of blood, and send him at your enemies. Bloodlust lets you do that.\n\nI really wish someone would have slapped whoever was responsible for the name and said 'Come on! Nobody thinks that sounds cool,' though.","March 2, 2015","true","7.9"," 72 of 80 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","72","80","5","0"

For those who are wanting to know if it's like Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines...I hesitate to say yes, but it might scratch that same itch.\n\nYou start off creating your character.  Choose between Vampire/Dhampir, Warrior/Witch/Criminal, and male/female.  Then you get some stat points to throw around, and you're thrown into the game which seems to have a fairly decent story.  There's also a surprising amount of voice acting in the game, every character is fully voiced.\n\nThe combat is a bit clunky and awkward, but still fun.  Besides a weapon and flashlight you will get some skills at the start, and can get quite a few more over time as you level up.  There are also skills used for things outside of combat, such as finding secrets (and there are a lot of secrets for those who enjoy hunting for that sort of thing).\n\nAs you encounter more NPCs and enemies, and do more quests, you can gain influence with various clans.  The dialogue with NPCs is pretty decent, and you'll get some different options if you spec into the right stats too.\n\nThe game is rough around the edges, but seems to be a hidden gem and I've enjoyed every minute of it so far.","August 5, 2015","true","7.5"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","65","71","2","0"

This game is very deep first-person ARPG, filled with more randomly-generated items and dungeons than you can shake a cross at.  There's a thin main story (some nonsense about going after your vampiric sire) but the meat of the game is buried in vast roguelike dungeons where you'll use your own vampiric powers and weapons to mercilessly slaughter legions of the undead, monsters, and other trash.  The game is easy to pick up and play, and the ingame tutorials will get you up to speed quickly, although there's a few game systems that you'll need to puzzle out during your own play time.\n\nIt's not all just hack and slash, though.  Bloodlust also tosses in helping helpings of alchemy, crafting, and other activities to spice up the grind.  There's really nothing really new here -- BloodLust is, at its core, a very familiar ARPG grind -- but the unexpected level of polish by this one-man-band production is very surprising.  Highly recommended, and there are some major studios out there who could learn from this game!","October 3, 2015","true","39.5"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","40","42","2","0"

Yes... the visuals are.... lacking to say the last. However, don't let that fool you though as the game's real charm is hidden under its layers of ugliness. Graphics settings will let you tamper with texture, AA and resolution settings to a certain extent; although, I found that with everything maxed my fps hitches a bit everytime I use a spell that produces clouds on the ground. With a GTX 770, this really shouldn't be happening with these kind of visuals. Enemy design is blurry and unimaginative although some well placed monster spawns do give you a heartbeat spike while you're dungeon crawling. Animations are stiff at best while more than a few cases of figures clipping through walls.\n\nThe game has a small town area that you will be able to explore during the story as well as some prostitues/hobos to suck blood from or turn into your family. Past that is where the real juice of this game is. There is a well fleshed out randomly generated dungeon system in this game filled with traps, treasures, monsters, etc. It's actually quite charming to go into the depths and worry about being making the decision to go further or turn back while you still have the chance. When your hp goes to 0, you will get knocked out. During that time, you can either choose to wake up where you were or spawn in the last safe zone. The caveat is that your body may have been looted while you were down.\n\nThe class system is basic with 3 in total. There are skill and talent trees that will let you have some diversity in builds. I felt that weapons are extremely restricted to certain classes though as each weapon type usually requires you to heavily invest in one of the three main combat stats. Warriors usually invest in strength to get more dps, witch with charisma, etc. I got a gun early on that required 50 points in strenght and another sword that wanted 30 in agi. These are stats that I wouldn't ever invest in as I picked the witch class. Another odd deisgn choice was separating persuasion from charism. Persuation has its own stat while charisma increases your magic... Lastly is the game's family system. You can suck someone's blood and build your own family. You need to level up the blodo sucking skill to increase family size and your minions have their own stats and skills you can upgrade. As a result of this however, they feel like faceless npc's with no personality.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game given its low price. While a one person developer certainly doesn't excuse its faults it does engender some sympathy for the lack of resources.","September 21, 2015","true","2.6"," 61 of 79 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","61","79","2","1"

Seriously liking this game. The only thing I personally don't like is the save system. I was used to the old manual save style where you could choose when to save, with F5 and F9 quick save/load always at the ready. This game uses the traditional dungeon crawler save system in where everything you do is automatically saved, making the choices you make kinda final.\n\n+ Wonky but fun hack and slash combat where in my character would use the special jump attack, only to get a derp face after getting slapped by a zombie mid-air lol.\n+ Voice acting. Yes, lots and lots of voice acting!\n+ Sire system in where you can manage your minions and bloodline.\n+ Being able to choose who you want to side with.\n+ Being able to choose your character's breed.\n+ Way more inventory options and items than VTMB.\n+ Interesting characters.\n+/- As I previously mentioned, I am personally not a fan of the save system but that's just me.\n\nOverall this is a diamond in the rough, and hopefully the devs are able to hammer out more issues within the game.

Having no idea about what has /is happening he starts seeking the meaning of his existence. Fortunately he got help by a voice that is talking and guiding him in the beginning.\n\nCharacter\nIn the very first minutes you can select to be a male or female vampire or a dhampir (ok, dhampir sounds funny). A Dhampirs is half vampire, half human, that means he is a bit weaker as a regular vampire, but he also requires less blood and is more resistant to fire, light  and silver.\n\nOnce this is done you must now choose one of three classes that are warrior, witch, criminal (melee, casting or ranged class). Each of them provides you with different attributes: Strength, dexterity, charisma, vitality, intelligence and persuasion. Ok, now that the easy part is done you have to "Roll the dice" untill your most favorable stats are shown (I always loved this feature) stats like Health, Stamina and Reputation will be determined here and you can reroll till you get the most powerfull combination fitting to your playstyle.\n\nMost of the stats are self-explanatory but some are more important to progress faster in-game.\n-Persuation is one stat you should always spend some points because it enables you many dialog options that can help you saving a lot of work and time.\n-Intelligence increases the chance of getting talent points when leveling up. These are used in your talent tree that is randomly generated everytime you create a new character. It becomes visible only after you have created your character!  Everytime you level up you receive 5 attribute points and 1 skill point +randomly 1 talent point (inteligence lvl /2).\n\nFeatures\nThe npc's in Bloodlust are mostly clanmembers of different clans. We got Vangres, Shadistin, Vurkas, Scades and Furlores. If you manage and make them to like you (using persuasion, do quests) your reputation with their clan will increase and enable clan related skills that can be purchased with your skill points. Some clans are more important to warrior classes (Vangres) some more important to caster (Vurkas) and some more to criminals (Scades).\n\nCreate your own clan (family)\nOne highlight of this game is the ability to sire humans by drinking their blood.\nOnce they become a member of your family you can send them to do various errands for you like collecting loot, collecting blood, assisting in combat and getting more family (victims). I managed to sire 4 and everyone got 10 victims. So I got a nice family of 44 members. In the latest versions you get extras for having more members (like another penthouse and more).\n\nExplore and Dungeoncrawl\nYou can follow the mainstory with quest and many sidequests but you can also start exploring the city with all the hidden switches and walls or climb down into the sewers and dungeons. Every dungeon map is randomly generated and has a lot of puzzles and traps to survive.\n\nBelow you can see how my lvl 110 Vampire had some fun with a few sired members.\nat Dungeon level 219 (low quality)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/P6UkUu-1hVY\n\nGraphics\neven if I am spoiled by "high end graphic games" I had a wonderfull experience with this "retro Unreal engine" game because of the great lightning and atmosphere. You feel the darkness in the city (since you are a vampire it is allways night) and the sound fits perfectly to this darkness. This helps you oversee the lack of npc variations and textures.\n\nIt didn't took me 115 hours to conclude that the game is worth his money but I wanted to make a complete review and everytime I was about to start my review the developers updatet the gamecontent adding more features and this daily!","June 22, 2015","true","117.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Nevertheless, it reminds of these two games pretty much on several details, like it is set in an urban modern vampire's underworld, it's pretty atmospheric, it's pretty much a role game that allows you to make choices and it features a bunch of vampire clans with its own habilities.\n\nBut BloodLust: Shadowhunter is pretty much a game on its own: it displays an open world, dungeon-crawler-oriented universe with a number of NPCs, plenty of loot-searching and dungeon-crawling exploration (dungeons are large and may have up to 200 levels).\n\nOn the down side, when you play the game you soon realize some features are a bit rough round the edges and need more polish: the graphics aren't bad, but they are a bit out of date. So are some mechanics, models, aesthetics and animations, but still, they are ok and they show a certain amout of detail in their design. The voice-acting is good, considering it's an amateur work, but could be much better and more varied if the developers spent some money on hiring professional actors.\n\nAs an early access game, it is common to find glitches and bugs still, but as a whole, the game is quite solid and playable at this moment, and most of the bugs are being fixed by the developer.\n\nIn sum, the game needs polish and could reach a very high standard if more people would be involved in the development (most of the work has been done by just one person, which, given the final result, is really impressive).\n\nOn the up side, the game is pretty atmospheric and dark, and you play some sort of vampire "tomb raider", so you constantly depend on flashlights. Dumb idea, considering you control a vampire and they can see in the dark? Not really, the dependency on flashlights really adds atmosphere to the gameplay, more considering enemies tend to spawn from the air at every corner, and otherwise you're alone in the dark and won't see a thing except distant lights and glowing eyes gazing at you.\n\nThe combat mechanics are quite decent and as a vampire you have plenty of fancy powers and abilities to use against your enemies. You also have the ability to sire some NPCs, command them to carry out different tasks and make your own clan. There's also a vampire clan system, so you can allign with one or another clan and improve your renown among them (which translates into learning their habilities).\n\nBloodLust: Shadowhunter is a more straight-forward game than VM. Bloodlines, it lacks a bit of its charisma or personality, but in some ways it takes the game experience further and expands it, in comparison with the Vampire Masquerade game.\n\nAll in all, BloodLust: Shadowhunter offers hours and hours of exploration, fighting, looting, dungeon-crawling and good fun, if you are ready to forgive the usual glitches and unfinished and out of date look of some models and mechanics. Still, consider it is an early-access game and is still beta, and the developer is working hard to polish things and fix bugs in an almost daily basis...\n\nFor me, it is definitely a game worth playing, and an ambitious and promising one. If you like proper vampire games, give it a try. In the end, this is the only serious attempt to a good vampire pc game we have had in years -and a successful one.","March 19, 2015","true","10.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","2"

Johansen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JSJohansen/","1978 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATE: My previous review didn't do this hidden gem—this soon-to-be-classic, this modern take on one of my absolute favorite genres—any justice what-so-ever. So I deleted my previous review because the only way to make sure this game gets what it deserves is a blank slate and a pair of sunglasses for protection from the bright, shining letters this game displays to me—upon playing for the 11 hours I've been in-game—and those letters are:\n\nG, O, T and Y.\n\n\n\nChapter One: This Game Took Over My Life\n\nI wish I was exaggerating. I wish I was, but this game has sucked me in and will not spit me back out, to the point where I had to sneak downstairs while my girlfriend was sleeping (help, I'm doing it again right now, I'm in the kitchen for gods sake, do I have any dignity anymore? No. No I do not. Yesterday I was in the bathroom.) just to force some hours of this fantastic first-person-dungeon-crawling hack & slash into my dry veins.\n\n\n\nChapter Two: The Dev That Never Stopped Patching\n\nThis game is made by "mostly one guy" a guy who by the way uploaded SEVEN PATCHES (300MB~ each) so filled with content that if you don't hold it carefully it will spill and cause an a couple thousand tsunamis. I posted a single bug report (because bugs in this game are actually hard to find) that was glitching some merchant inventories, he replied to me directly TWO minutes later, and a patch fixing the bug came out an HOUR later. This is a man who obviously loves his work, because the amount of time he has dedicated to this game is something you rarely find in modern game development. By definition this is an "indie" game but that term—recently—does not do this game justice, and I want none of it in my review. This game has the quality of a game created by multiple teams of people, with a much bigger budget.\n\n(cont.)\nThe cinematography is also amazing, I thought at first (the intro) that the man leading the project (I didn't for a second consider the fact that there was no team, just ONE MAN) had a director or something doing the scenes, it felt so movieesque, not to mention the atmosphere in this game makes you forget everything around you. Except the sun, I was playing at daytime and—because I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥—was sitting by the window with my screen aimed directly at the window, glare-city. (I bet you thought there was going to be a vampire joke because this is a vampire game and I mentioned the sun, but you aren't getting any funny from me, you should know this by now, look at my writing!.)\n\n\n\nChapter Three: Shut The ♥♥♥♥ Up Johnnyjsj\n\nDo you like it? Made it just for you, reader-man. I know there's a list of features already, but I can't help it, look at me, I'm 22 and this game made me write the most biased review yet, in the style of a 12 year old girl leaning over the fence in a desperate attempt to touch the J. Beiber. Yet I have no problem with this, I have accepted it, how this review is written conveys everything I wanted to say, perfectly. I am okay with being that hypothetical 12 year old girl (okay, lets be real here, I'll add fanboy to the list of terms accurately describing my current behavior.) Anyway so without further ado, here's the list of features off the top of my head and onto the grey digital paper that Gaben loves so much.\n\n\n\nThe List\n\n(remember these features may change, additions or subtractions, I doubt divisions will occur though (hehe get it, math joke, or something, maybe not a joke, I don't know, you have no idea how much I want to stop writing this review and play the damn game but I must soldier on. We can do this. (I'll elaborate on the features below, as to not drown you all in text.))\n\nCharacter Creation:\n• Three Classes (Warrior (The Warrior); Witch (The Mage) and Criminal (The Rogue/Ranger))\n• Two Races (Vampire; Dhampir (Half-Vampire, Half-Human))\n\nDungeons:\n• Multiple Randomly Generated Dungeons (over 200+ floors deep)\n\n\n\nElaborate\n\nCharacter Creation\n• The Three Classes: The Warrior, Witch and Criminal all have different talent trees and—get this—every single character you make has his/her own unique talent tree—yes that's right, you heard me, every character has a bunch of talents that are placed randomly in a tree which you can choose from, it's a feature I've only seen in RTS/4X games (random tech tree anyone?) They—obviously—all have different skills as well, this is where stuff gets juicy, I have yet to play as a warrior but when I (USED TO) did have that bug that changed merchents inventories (AGAIN, THIS IS FIXED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN)\n\nI rerolled as a female witch, her name a mixture of my girlfriend's name plus "bae" (because I am one creative son-of-a) and—usually I am not a fan of spell casters, I love being the tankiest tank there is, wielding a warhammer in one hand and YOUR MOM in the other, hah!—but the witch class was one of the most fun experiences I've had in games as of late, what the dev said about controller support (there is a partial support right now, I can only assume that this will be expanded upon?) that although he is working on it, it is still easier to play with keyboard + mouse because of the accuracy—which I completely agree with—I still however have yet to play using the magical mouse-and-keyboard-kombo (get it, like mortal kombat, ha ha... ha...) and have instead been using the partial controller support and configuring the rest using xpadder, and so far so good.\n\nThough having a keyboard is definitely an advantage as there are a good amount of shortcuts (No, not like TOO MANY, not rogue-like levels of shortcuts but just a normal amount for convenience. (Speaking of Rogue-likes, if I see any of you tag this as a "Rogue-like" I swear I will track you down and perma kill you. This isn't a Rogue-LITE either, so god help you. I'll find you.))\n\n• The Two Races: the Vampire I have yet to play, I went with the Dhampir because they—this isn't a spoiler you should know this by now—are less sensitive to the light etc as they are not fully undead. I will always put spoilers on actual spoilers so don't you worry little Timmy, you're magnificent experience will go untarnished.\n\n• The Randomly Generated Dungeons: in a game—which I will say again and again—filled with dark and gritty atmosphere, are doors leading to dungeons, the world outside of these dungeons is handcrafted—and beautifully so—these dungeons are not handcrafted (thankfully) which—together with the handcrafted areas—blend into a perfect game world, the handcrafted areas are the milk, the base; the dungeons, the cream; and just like a cappuccino, taste delicious with an early morning breakfast, and just like that breakfast, these dungeons are filled with nutritious content.\n\nYou will go loony for loot (just as you have in the countless ARPGs before you picked up this pristine example of gaming gems) you will do 180s and run like hell with huge things chasing you down for said early breakfast (not sure if they have cappuccino or not though) you will find people lost in the dungeon, there are so many events, effects, and (I can't think of a better word, I'm thinking like mutations from UT2004, you know like, things that change the game up) mutations on various floors, like one that effects your night vision making it hard to see speaking of atmosphere (if you were playing this game instead of *still* pondering if it's worth the $12 (how could you possibly think otherwise, literally, how, shame on you sir and/or madam and/or somehow both genders simultaneously if you by any chance come from tumblr) then you would understand why!) the flashlight game mechanic is done so well, it looks and feels great without being a nuisance like other horror games.\n\nOh crap, I reached cap.\n\ntl;dr\n\n1) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_wZxahUgAAy_XV.png\n2) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_wbER8VAAANrmz.png","March 10, 2015","true","30.9"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","22","29","8","0"

Graphics are decent - remind me of Vampire Bloodlines which is pretty good for a dungeon crawler - gameplay reminds me of Hellgate London if that game had been good. Basically imagine a third person Diablo in the Vampire the Masquarade world.\n\nLooting is fun and adictive. I've only played two of the three character types (witch and criminal) and they play very differently, and I've seen enough of their skill trees to see that even within the types you could build your character to be as specialized or general as you'd like.\n\nVoice acting is fine from what I saw, combat is as good as any of these  types of games with decent range of magic, melee, and ranged weapons. There's an interesting 'sire' game componant, where you can turn people into your minions - I haven't played the game enough to do much with it but it does pose intrieging posibilities.\n\nWhat more can I say? It's in early access, which in this case is a good thing, because the game is a lot of fun as is, and the idea that there is a lot more to come is a entising one. At the time of this review I've only played around 1.5 hours, so I've only scratched the surface, but I can't wait to see what else this game has to offer. The only thing I'd like to see (which admittedy may be in the game and i simply haven't seen it yet) is some 'outside' areas - towns and non combat hubs similar to Diablo 2, Bloodlines, etc.  Right now it's all dungeon crawl and nothing else. Bringing in some hubs would be good.\n\nEdit - about 15 minutes on and I've reached the above ground hub area :) Yep, I've pretty much got no complaints - best game since Vampire Bloodlines.","April 22, 2015","true","4.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It has more in common with Vampire Masquerade if anything, but at its heart it's very much a dungeon-crawler with some overworld questing, which leads to more dungeons :)\n\n*The visuals are workable, they're not going to wow Crysis-lovers, but they're also not eye-gougingly bad, they're completely serviceable and they fit the atmosphere quite nicely.\n\n*Audio is great, decent voice acting and suitably dark ambient audio.\n\n*Loot. Loot. Loot and more LOOT! That is the crux of the game, the bread and butter, the alpha and omega.. you play this like any other aRPG; to get moar loot! Rings, gloves, boots, weapons, armour, helms, even facial attachments like masks, glasses and piercings. There are lots of quests to undertake, though a lot of them are "go here, collect this, come back" style, they're basically just reasons to reenter the dungeons and find more loot!\n\nAll in all, I've put 16 hours into this so far and I'm really enjoying it.

I know there are a few that can't recommend the game but I honestly don't think a good recommendation can come from less than an hour of gameplay. Now that it's finally been released out of EA; I want to say a few things about it.\nThe story is interesting although a bit non involved with the overall gameplay. I would say, it really doesn't need to be followed as closely to enjoy the game in its entirety.\nCombat is a bit clunky but enjoyable once you get the hang of it. Reminds me a bit of the Gothic series.\nLooting and dungeon delving is probably my favourite part of the game. There are tons of loot to find in the game with qualities from common to rare and unique. Dungeons are randomly generated each time you start one. There are random stairwells that appear every few floors to help with escape if needed.\nCharacter progress is fun as well. Many skills and traits to choose from that increase your inventory size, allow mist transformation to save keys and move through gated doors, allow summoning of more minions, increase specific stats every level and even transform into a beast for brutal melee action. You can also increase the stats of your minions as you progress.\nOverall, I would rate it an 8/10. I'm not one for considering graphics into my rating so please take into consideration for yourselves that it isn't top of the line. I think the developer did an amazing job and the game is enjoyable for what it is.

Characters and environments are kinda ugly, lighting could be a lot better, animations sucks... but still I find it more enjoyable than most games.\n\nMaybe it's because of the ambiance, it reminds me old games from the PS2/N64 era like Shadowman. And it's about vampires. There aren't many good games with vampires, people prefer to kill zombies...\n\nThe game is full of good ideas like the "secret-revealing vison", the orb projection to activate stuff from a distance, the vampire super jump, the sire system, and you can even equip piercings like any other equipment. You character can even feel other creatures.\n\nIt's also nice to be able to choose between vampire/dhampir, male/female and 3 classes ( basically fighter, mage and rogue, not really original ).\n\nThe game is separated in different "phases" and you can play them as you want. The main quest has a story, objectives and NPCs, but you can also delve into procedurally generated "dungeons" that you find in secret areas. Each level of the dungeon becomes harder, and the loot gets better. The third phase is the arena, when you can fight hard monsters, but I didn't try that yet as it seemed too hard for my level.\n\nOther than that it's kinda classic, you level up, spend points on your stats, skills and perks, bite some bum to have a minion you can control, and that's it.\n\nBut it's one of the few early access games I don't regret buying. The base is solid ( but ugly ) and can only get better.\n\nGood luck to the dev, worth supporting.","August 23, 2015","true","7.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I don't really want to give the game a bad review per se, but I just can't recommend it. If I were to go by the general rating systems used by mainstream gaming sites, it would be in the 6/10 range. It's really commendable one guy made it and all, but the game is essentially a mediocre rendition of several gameplay elements, and pretty lackluster visuals.\n\nI don't really mean the poor textures either. Rather, the whole scale of the game, maps and field of vision just seem weirdly constructed relative to the player. Everything in the hub areas feel very claustrophobic and simply dumped there to tick a checklist of what needs to be in a game requiring objective locations. (oddly enough, Bloodlines had a similar feeling, but the gameworld was like 100 times more fleshed out, so it worked).\n\nThe combat is incredibly clunky and plays out in an awkward, third person hack and slash style. I'm sure attacks being halted if an enemy hits you is intentional, but it just plays out in a very sluggish and turgid way. Attacks don't even seem to connect when doing damage. The physics are as such, that you never feel in controls of combat. You may as well stand there and play it as if you were playing an MMO.\n\nCharacter growth is just bizarre and stats seem to progress with the intention of minutely progressing a pretty selective path. Rather than making a 'build', you feel like your character isn't really going anywhere other than being able to utilize one of a few methods of play. When STR and DEX do almost nothing to help your damage/defense capabilities, you have a problem. The talent tree promises a nice random factor, but comes across as rather redundant as a whole.\n\nThe random dungeons are really well done and perhaps are the most worthy aspect of the game. The problem is everything around it; the questing, the story, leveling up, and general sense of accomplishment just didn't make me feel all that invested, or interested to keep going. The story is just stale, the characters around all feel like bad extras who turned up with no director to give them any degree of motivation or method. Characters running around idle in the hub area just so you can constantly bite them without any consequence is incredibly dumb too.\n\nAlso, I've no idea how this game is coded, but it EATS resources. My rig feels like it's going to explode as soon as you load the game up, and it's specs are way above being decent.\n\nAll in all, this is merely for old school RPG enthusiasts.

If you're selective about what RPGs you play, you'll probably not enjoy this, and will get rather frustrated early on.","October 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","2"

The game has some interesting ideas but unfortunately they are poorly implemented. I haven't finished the game, but I haven't enjoyed playing it so far, so I've decided to abandon my playthrough.\n\nThe combat is weak, due to a combination of "floaty" physics, and stiff character animations. Attacks don't feel like they've got any weight to them. You can turn Humans into vampires who will then fight at your side, which is good in theory, but the AI is dumb as a brick. Sometimes they just stand around and do nothing. Fortunately they can't die, at worst they get knocked out for a few seconds, so at least they still function as a distraction while you kill the monsters, but its still annoying.\n\nThe main content of the game involves dungeon crawling. There are several different dungeons, and the deeper you go, the better loot you find, but you also have to fight tougher monsters. There's an achievement for reaching the 200th floor, but I think these dungeons might just continue on forever. Every floor has a randomly generated layout and item/monster placement. Again, this all sounds good.\n\nHowever, what I don't like is the number of quests that ask you to find a specific item within those random dungeons. Maybe you find it immediately, or maybe you wander around aimlessly for hours. It also doesn't help that when you leave a dungeon to complete a quest, everything resets, so when you get a new quest that sends you back to the same dungeon, you have to grind through everything all over again. It gets tedious pretty quickly. Maybe if the combat was more enjoyable it would be less of a problem, but I still think its poor design. The story, dialogue and voice acting are all terrible.\n\nFrom reading the forums I understand the game is developed by one person, so I feel kinda bad for trashing his work. But at the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me how many people were involved or how much resources they had to work with. I just want to play good games, and a bad game developed by one person is still a bad game. I wouldn't even recommend picking up Bloodlust Shadowhunter on sale, because it would still be a waste of time that could be spent with better games.","December 8, 2015","false","12.2"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","30","48","0","0"

There's a lot to be impressed with considering the game was put together almost entirely by one man. I respect that, and he did a lot of things right. For instance, some of the melee combat seems decent, there are some varied vampiric disciplines (spells/powers) you can cast/use. The game even has a Diablo-style loot system with items of different levels of quality, scrolls of identification, etc., 200-floor dungeons that randomly generate their arrangement with more XP and loot rewards the deeper you go, etc.\n\nAlthough there are flaws with each of these, they're mostly done very well and I know this was a lot of hard work for the developer. The city map looks quite nice. It's a small, urban cityscape. Businesses are still open, though some have closed, and it looks good. A tree is growing out of a curb on one street I noticed, which looks cool, but the city looks too active for that to make sense. Weird, but I'm fine with it, even if it does make me scratch my head. One final note on the positives for this game: most of the music "works" and isn't very noticable, which is just fine, while a couple of the songs (tattoo parlor radio and main city hub in particular) were enjoyable and set the mood, respectively.\n\nThat said, I was at odds deciding whether or not to give it my recommendation. Simply knowing few people were involved in the game's creation, the fact it's (at the time of this review) still in early access, and it was decent enough that I could play it as long as I did...these things make me want to give it a recommendation, but those aren't particularly good things about the game.\n\nAt the time of releasing the early access of this game, the store page shows the developer estimated 2-3 months before it would leave early access. When I talk about the negatives about this game, I'll keep in mind that this is the state of the game now if someone purchases it, and that the negatives I will point out will not be ones I expect the developer to address within that estimated time frame due to the extremities of these negatives.\n\nLike I said, it's not a bad game; just an okay one I couldn't get into despite having a big interest in the subject matter and genre. Here are some of the negatives:\n\nThe NPCs are very poor characters for the most part. The rare few who seem to have the slightest bit of personality are okay at best. The world also feels extremely empty. I don't mean bleak or hopeless; those are great for this kind of setting. No, I mean that there just aren't enough NPCs around for you to interact with or even those that just wander around making the world feel inhabited. I have encountered a total of three NPCs in the big city hub's streets. Imagine if Santa Monica in Bloodlines or Prague in Redemption had a total of 3 NPCs on the streets at night. Each building typically features 1-3 NPCs in it, with the exception of the night club, which I believe has 5 or 6. Many of these do not speak or give quests.\n\nI just don't feel supernatural in this game, despite playing as a vampire. I wanted to play as a monster; not as an average person in the game's world. By not having a real human presence, my character is the average, normal person in the setting. I've only seen 3-4 NPCs which seemed to be human, and none of them are actual characters. One of them was just a random human to send to vampires to feed on, and the other three just lay or wander around until you turn them into vampires. Once you've done that, you're in a world without humans. That takes much of the fun out of being a vampire in the game. What's worse, it makes no sense that this many vampires can sustain themselves in a city without humans. There aren't any "vampires require invitations to enter homes" rules that the game has mentioned, so it's unlikely that the humans are just asleep at home, and as Bloodlines, Redemption, the real world, and many other games have shown, fair amounts of people are outside at night in urban areas. Even vampires aren't walking around the city aside from the player.\n\nHumans seem to know all about vampires as well, because one of the three humans on the city streets says something to the effect of "Oh, your teeth. You're one of those monsters, aren't you?" Although Shadowhunters (vampire hunters) exist, regular humans seem to know about vampires' existence. It feels so awkward without in-game lore and explanation to make sense of vampires' place in this world. Despite there being five vampire clans, bunches of items, a number of powers and enemies, there just isn't much in the way of lore/explanations for things to understand the setting and get into it.\n\nThe story is almost non-existent so far, and I've gone through several main quests thus far. The game begins as you wake up in a sarcophagus, freshly turned, and get a message from your sire to come find her. You don't know who she is and you need to get out of some ruins and go to a tattoo parlor to find her. Everything that's been happening since then is a boring fetch quest of sorts. The plot developments haven't interested me or surprised me, and today, I loaded the game up to continue, opened my quest log, and just stared at it, blinking, thinking to myself "Why am I still playing?", and then quit. I'd been forcing myself to play as far as I'd gotten, and absolutely nothing sounded fun to do, even if it just meant going to kill things in the 200-floor dungeons. If a game doesn't have a setting or story interesting enough to interest me in continue, the gameplay must be absolutely fantastic for me to get past that, and the gameplay is just "decent." The controls and combat are comparable to blood lines, which isn't a good thing, though it is a little bit smoother when it comes to melee. You fight in third person and can use a variety of spells/disciplines. I haven't tried the ranged weapons, though I hear you will run out of ammunition pretty often at present. I will say that the combat is better than VtM Redemption's, but that combat was pretty awful (great story, though).\n\nAt the end of the day, I had no motivation to play the game and found myself uninterested in the setting and what I was doing in it the more I played, despite loving vampires and enjoying action RPG antics. Its actual gameplay wasn't enjoyable enough to drive me just by itself, and the story and characters are very forgettable with rare exception. This is not a bad game, but it just isn't all that good. That said, the developer really should be proud of what he's accomplished and I applaud him for his hard work, but I simply cannot recommend playing this game. I have many technical issues with the game which I haven't mentioned, but I won't hold them against the game in this review, because I believe the developer is still looking into them. The things I've covered here as negatives, though, seem highly unlikely to change or change sufficiently, given the amount of time and money involved in changing/adding to them.","March 14, 2015","false","18.2"," 53 of 91 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","53","91","5","0"

Sure, it's Early Access. Sure, you're bound to encounter things that don't work as planned. However, what the game does have it tons of character, some really unique and nice loot and plenty of quests, secrets and hidden areas to keep you busy for a nice while. All this and that's not taking into account the hidden dungeon system that can spawn, literally, hundreds of levels down to go treasure hunting.\n\nThe voice acting is cheesy at times, the hit boxes and detection system doesn't seem to be fully fleshed out and your minions will get stuck behind the stupidest ♥♥♥♥. The music is good and the rpg side of the game seems to be pretty rock solid. Alchemy most definitely needs some more work as at level 2 I was crafting potions that were giving me a +20 to stats. Can you say OP?\n\nAll in all, take it at face value for now. It's EA and it's fully playable. There are some bugs, there are some things that the developer is working on constantly and he is truly engaged with his Steam audience, which, in my book, is always a great thing. It has tons and tons of potential. Put aside any thinking that you're going to be playing a bleeding edge graphic rpg and you'll be fine.

From its nitty gritty atmosphere to the amatuer voice acting this game has me hooked. Alot of people are comparing it to Bloodlines but to be honest other then its a good vampire game I just dont see it. This game focuses more on dungeon diving and I say diving because in dungeons you can go through (I believe) 200 floors all randomly generated and can only come back out when you found a staircase that leads back to the top floor. You have to make a choice whether to go down further and face harder enemies or to escape with the loot you have. This tends to encompass a good portion of the game.\n\nThe story line is interesting and intriguing enough to motovate me to continue on. Combine that with an active Developer and community it is exciting to see how far this game will go.\n\nTBH ever since VM bloodlines I've been hunting for a good vampire game that lets me experiance a rise to power story and never found it till this.

A dungeon crawling modern gothic horror RPG?  Guess that sums it up.  It doesn't really do it justice though.  The game is amazingly fun and entertaining considering how simple it is.  Gameplay consists of two basic 'areas' of play.  One is the dungeons, an infinite number of randomly generated levels of monsters to fight usually to obtain some quest goals.  Then there is the City where you do most of your RP and plot development.  Both are entertaining and surprisingly creative.\n\nGameplay can get a bit repetetive.  There are only so many kinds of monsters to fight and the dungeons can get a bit stale after twenty or so floors of slogging through them.  The storyline is clever and amusing though so it gives you some solid motivation to fight through it all.\n\nReally very entertaining.

That said... it has some issues that hopefully some funding will help fix.  Also, I've only played to just beyond the started area and the main street is rather empty, but seems like the start of a decent hub of activity.  There is a story, but I have yet to figure out if it's as detailed as Bloodlines.  I have yet to find out if/how many side stories there are, like the dozens that Bloodlines had.\n\nPros:\nIt has clan based vampires like Bloodlines\nIt has skill customization like Bloodlines\nRandomized (?) dungeons, unlike Bloodlines\nMassive amounts of loot, Diablo style, unlike Bloodlines\nIt has a very similar atmosphere to Bloodlines\n\nNeutral:\nThe voice acting is decent, but not great.  Some good, some bad, like Bloodlines.\nCombat is on par with Bloodlines and could use some work, but skills are interesting\n\nCons:\nThe graphics are on par (flat textures and dated models) with Bloodlines\nThe non-randomized level design is worse than Bloodlines\nThe "world" maps where you would interact with bystanders is far smaller than Bloodlines and so fewer to interact with\nThe UI could use some work and is worse than Bloodlines\nThe devs left in the default "Built with UDK" icon and task description, unlike Bloodlines\n\nIt's not even close to a finished product.  If you didn't like Bloodlines then you won't like this.  So much potential but failing so hard on the lack of polish.  It's still early access and I'm probably hoping for more than will be delivered, but it drives a stake through a fond spot in my heart.\n\nThe dungeon crawling aspect may or may not end up being core to whatever form this game takes, but it was one of the main things that drew me in.  The game is not balanced, the dungeon is tedious at points, but it is a great start and something Bloodlines didn't have.  (Yes, I had to fit that in.)  This game is not in beta.  It is most definitely still in alpha, but if you go in understanding that it's a good few hours diversion and I recommend it.","March 4, 2015","true","6.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The Event was playing a Vampire themed Role Playing Game where you the player where the monster trying hard to either keep what was little left of their humanity or to simply watch the world burn around them.\n\nMy friends and I would spend hours at the Comic Book store rolling and debating as we strugled to keep each other from our final deaths while a mad but dethroned ruler was trying to start the god machine. A plot that had been in the works for at least a few hundred years if not thousands. Our storyteller (Game Master) was a really great creative writer in our school and had a fresh and lively story that spanned a couple of years of actual game play time twice a week.\n\nDespite all the rough edges and some time janky audio and animations. I am transported back to those after school game sessions I had played in as a young man.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows a certain saying I have about video games and the Indie Game movement.\n\n"You could have the worst graphics and audio in the world but so long as you have a kick ♥♥♥ story, I love it..."\n\nwhen I recently bought this game in early access, this saying I have was tested. Sadly I gave a knee jerk review after only an hour or so of game play. And shamefully I forgot my standing on what truly matters to me in a game.\n\nThis game is Early Access, it has a few flaws that are hard to miss at time. The Graphics are not Triple A quality, nor should they ever be expected to be.\n\nThe Story however, That is the real gem here. and I have to hand it to the guy, it is one awesome story.\n\nThe game starts with the player waking up after the embrace (Turned into a Vampire) with out the slightest idea what happened to them or why they are a vampire. Worse yet they don't even know how to be a vampire in this strange new world they find them selves in.\n\nQuickly the story get rolling in the discover what going on as you move along sort of way. This includes discovering how to be a vampire alone with no Sire to guide you in you first steps into the night.\n\nThe Scenery and Locations are actually really interesting despite their repetitive issues. A lot of this game seems to be made up of a few key 3D mesh parts and a bit of texture work along with tweaked stock UDK parts every now and then. I could be wrong about the UDK stock parts however.\n\nThis game uses UDK (a stripped down version of Unreal Engine 3 for indie studios and students) as it's base engine. One I was once a very proud fanboy of until I recently migrated to Unity. I know a few of the challenges this guy must have had to account for. It's still a good engine to use and it can crank out some awesome games in the right hands. Hands like WRF Studio which is apparently Just one Guy with the Help of like two or three others in this games case.\n\nThe Diablo like dungeon crawling aspect is fun and while a bit repetitive, keeps my vampire always growing in power as I slowly build up my bloodline. This is the sort of Character level Metric as well as the state of my ever growing family of vampire minions. My pet Hobo and I are rocking these dungeon maps while the rest are out collecting loot for me to make use of in the game.\n\nThe interface is much like that of an MMO or again Diablo action bar with a few skills at my fingertips. This allows for me to quickly fire off power my vampire has discovered When he needs to use them.\n\nPower as mentioned above are fairly strait forward. While there are clans in the game, You as a new vampire are actually not a member of any one clan and thus are not pigeon holed into a Clan set of skills and powers. As you progress and earn rep with the other clans int he game, certain power will open up to you that you can put a few points into. It's a lot more free form then a certain Vampire Themed computer game based on the table top game I loved as a young man.\n\nAll and all I really love this game and it the sort of love that had to be hard earned but now is never going to be let go.\n\nI am still going to highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a great You are the Monster Vampire experience.\n\nTo people who are debating to give this game a try:\n\nDO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP...\n\nTo the Developer:\n\nDO NOT RUSH THE GAME TO RELEASE!\nKeep crafting and polishing this gem for as long as it is needed.","July 23, 2015","true","15.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Make sure you read "What exactly is Bloodlust" before you buy, if you haven’t already. This is definitely more of an RPG dungeon crawler than a traditional RPG akin to Bloodlines. If that appeals to you then you should grab it...immediately. Worst case scenario? You don’t like it and you are out $13.

As also stated, this is a game very much in the same feel as VtM Bloodlines though the story seems a bit fragmented in the early access version.  The controls are a bit awkward but can be gotten used to--and used well.  The general instructions are a bit vague in places but nothing you can't figure out with a bit of exploration.\n\nAs of the early access version, there are several instances of the story not making sense if you happen to meet certain characters during your free-roaming exploration as opposed to because someone told you to go there.  (Stuff like going into an area and finding someone who says they've been expecting you and to thank you for your help with a person you haven't actually met or helped yet...or stumbling across a character and begin with dialogue about how you need their help with something and you don't know who they are or why you need to go to them for help)  So, at this point, don't count on the story blowing your mind.\n\nBut all of this is minor and not even remotely worth counting against a really great game.  My only real negative on the game is the auto-save.  It saves after every little thing you do and you can't have multiple save spots.  I know this is to make the decisions mean more (as once you make it, you've made it), BUT here's the thing not considered.....\n\nThis game is also a dungeon crawler.  That means, if you screw up a decision and want to start a new character to fix the decision, it's not just a matter of playing some fun and enjoyable story over again....it's HOURS of wandering randomly generated dungeons to catch back up to where you were.","March 5, 2015","true","47.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

A dark world, in which you are a vampire (or half-vampire) hunting down clues to your past. Who created you? Why? And who is that, calling to you in your mind?\n\nThere's action, puzzles that you can solve with different types of vampire powers, such as secret sight and vampire gaze. Dialogue is well-written and voiced, based on the characters that you meet.\n\nThe game is still in early access, but it's really a lot of fun. There's a ton of places to explore, lots of interesting loot, and lore to read and learn about. One of my favorite things are the letters and books that you'll find, because one, you learn about the world around, and being a fledgling vampire, that's pretty important. The second thing is that the artwork and imagery in the letters and books is really beautiful, and definitely not what I was expecting to come across in a game like this.\n\nOne thing I would suggest to the developer is to allow players to customize their character with different hair colors and styles, facial features, possibly different make-up looks, and clothing. Right now the only thing that changes your look is what gender and class you choose.\n\nGive this one a try, You won't be disappointed.

It can easily cater to Vampire masquerade, Diablo and Heretic/Hexen fans. The skill tree is extensive, the puzzles are fun, although not overly challenging, and the loot - ah, the loot is glorious. Finding that first purple item while crawling through the dungeon as a mere level (bloodline) 3 fledgling will  bring about an immense sense of satisfaction and will leave you wanting to find more, to delve deeper, to explore further.  I had not had a chance to fully explore the city, but the dungeon is rumored to have more than 200+ levels which can definitely take quite a few hours, if not days, to clear.\nAs this is still Early Access minor graphic glitches can be forgiven. So far I have not experienced any crashes, and reloading the game fixed any graphic stuttering that I encountered twice.\nFor the price of $12.99 I would highly recommend this game as it shows a lot of promise and with some polish can turn into a new cult classic.

It has some issues with controls and other things and in the beginning it seemed not to be what I was looking for. But, I stuck with it and ended up really liking it despite its flaws. Then I read the discussions and realized that this was basically one guy making the whole game and that made me like it more and forgive its faults. Honestly, my most major gripe after finishing it is how many women in it don't speak and are used as decoration (whereas even the male generic characters have something they say) in the various lairs you end up in. But, that's not uncommon in the gaming world and having a feminist analysis doesn't mean I can't still have fun. Second biggest gripe is that you can't load old saves. There are a few things I would have liked to finish and I missed out on quests that I didn't realize I had entered when I couldn't reload an old save.\n\nVTMB is one of my favorite games. I have replayed it so many times that I honestly can't anymore. This was suggested as similar. It is a little similar but it is also it's own thing in the dungeon crawling being centered.

The developer will personally help you out if you post your issue in the discussions and the nature of Steam refunds means it's worth trying out anyway. The game does come with a small readme too. I'll put what fixes worked for me at the bottom of this review.\n\nProbably best described as third-person Diablo 2 set in an almost World of Darkness (i.e. VTM:B's setting) with the same lack of polish as STALKER but somehow it all works. I'm going to stress the ARPG/dungeon crawler link more as gameplay-wise it's towards the Diablo end. What it does take from VTM:B (and indeed improves on over it) is the use of non-combat skills in particular persuasion which gives you some fairly major benefits. Also blood drinking, of course.\n\nThe tutorial mode is essential for a first time player and even then you might have to check out the discussions for some things (in particular cracking safes and backstabbing) but I didn't have any major problems. Do note that you can conveniently zoom the camera in and out and change the mouse between a more traditional mode instead of having it control the direction the character is looking etc with hotkeys.\n\nThe graphics and sound are serviceable and there's plenty of voice acting which generally falls into the better end of VA quality, a (pleasant) surprise for a small budget game like this.\n\nThe ability to sire new members is fun but I'd have liked to be able to equip them with things or possibly use them to take things back and sell them for me like pets in Torchlight. In general inventory space is very limited until you grab the right talents.\n\nAll in all it's good fun and I'm not even the biggest fan of ARPGs. I can't speak for the class variety but I tried the Witch and there were a good few build options there.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me with the 'Built with UDK stopped working' error:\n\n1. Verifying integrity (properties > local files > verify integrity of cache) repeatedly. At first this kept showing one file missing but eventually it went away. In between doing this I tried to start it a few times.\n2. Rebooting after I installed the game and again after verifying a few times and installing the demo.\n3. Downloading and installing the demo[www.lasthalfofdarkness.com] for this game (it had the same crashing issue for me originally).\n4. Setting the settings in the launcher to the maximum available resolution with fullscreen off.\n\nWhat didn't work for me but has been suggested elsewhere:\n\n1. Changing some lines about shaders in the config to true instead of false. You'll have to look in the discussions for this but mine were already set to true.\n2. Changing the UDK.exe to Windows XP compatibility mode and/or running it as admin.\n3. Reinstalling the game.\n4. Starting the game without using the launcher/without using Steam.\n\nAs I say the developer will help you out if you get really stuck so don't worry.","January 23","true","11.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You can pick from multiple classes and multiple species of Vampires, and you'll fight creatures like mummies, wolfmen, and even Yetis.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting feature is the ability to sire people. Almost any NPC you see walking the streets can be turned into a companion character. You literally get to build your own clan of vampires. Speaking of which, the game's gritty urban setting is ruled by different vampire clans. The skill system is tied to your reputation with said clan, meaning to unlock and level certain skills you have to get in good with their respective clans.\n\nThis is the only game I've ever seen that lets you pierce your nose and use it as another equipment slot.\n\nI've put 21 hours into the main story so far and I'm having a blast! The game doesn't do very much in the way of hand holding though, and at the moment there are a lack of quality guides to help you through those tough spots you just can't figure out.\n\nIn short, this game is SO much fun, and worth your time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paercebal/recommended/280600/","paercebal","paercebal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paercebal/","59 products in account","TL;DR: That game is awesome but perhaps for a specific kind of gamers (fans of WoD, this game is for  you!).\n\nI played a lot Vampire: The Masquerade, and the two video games (Redemption and Bloodlines) are one of my preferred. Still, since then, I have that itch of playing a vampire-related game (not a "Blade", or a "Twilight", mind you. "World of Darkness" related).  And since the disappointment of CCP games' abandonment of their World of Darkness MMORPG, I felt like that itch would remain.\n\nBloodlust: Shadowhunter scratches that itch. All in the right way.\n\nI would not be surprised to learn the developers of this game had a similar itch, and went through the whole process or creating a game that was missing (at least, for me).\n\nThe cons:\n- The graphics are 10 years-old quality\n- The interface is sometimes clumsy\n- Little or no documentation (what does "MM Knock Back" means, seriously?)\n- 32-bits... Seriously, my game crashed once because it reached the "out of memory" limit. there must be a leak somewhere, but still... 32-bits?\n\nThe not-cons:\n- No control over the save file: I'm a paranoid, so I wasn't  happy when I realized I would not have saves as I desire. The thing is, I realized that I don't really need them. I'm still surprised by that.\n- The random dungeons: I  hate grinding for XPs or whatever, and the dungeons are a bit frightening... But increasing levels is fast enough, and as long as I don't need to do 100-levels dungeons just to make the story happen, I'll be happy (in fact, at the 4th level, my priority is to get out, because grinding gets boring)\n- For me, the game crashes if you put high-quality graphics. Don't hesitate to lower them. Then, the game is stable as a rock (only crashed once after that)\n\nThe pros:\n- The mood. Despite the primitive graphics, the developer nailed it down. I felt like playing a Kindred in a World of Darkness. The music, and ambient sounds. Everything helps you be part of the story\n- The story. In spite of random dungeons, there is a story, a  background, and a setting. It's sometimes a bit surprise (every mortal seems to know about vampires?)\n- Your bloodline. The childer you sire, fighting with you, or gathering loot or blood. Awesome.\n\nWhat I want for Bloodlust 2:\n- Keep "Bloodlust" as the name of your games. Drop "shadowhunter".\n- A larger city\n- More vampires\n- More quests\n- More character appearance customization\n- A bit more sims-like behavior (mortals, other vampires, etc., and your childer should do things on their own... perhaps even including betraying you!)\n- making it easy to add quests/characters/mods/(written) dialogs, even city blocks\n- NOT better graphics. If I wanted graphics, I would be playing whatever current AAA game. I want that specific kind of game, and the graphics were good enough for me.\n\n... because if there is a Bloodlust 2 in preparation, count me in, immediately!\n:-)","January 9","true","34.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Of course there has to be a fun factor, and every review I have seen weighs that fun factor with time spent versus money paid.  Although that being said, free games get their bad reviews as well, which says a lot.  This game, I know, has that fun factor and creates a world that can be immersive.\n\nSo, Bloodlust Shadowhunter.  I played the demo, and now own the full game here on Steam.\n\nThe hand-created areas in the tutorial and beginning areas outside of the main city area are really well crafted.  Yeah, the combat is a bit different (some say its jittery or wonky), but it's that difference that gives this game its flavor.  I play a spell caster normally in my games, and to hang back and watch minions attack while I fire away at my spells is a blast in Shadowhunter.  Setup your key bindings the way an mmo is played, and you're right at home.  Changing talent tree is also new, and some have hated it, but I like it.  It makes it a different experience with each playthrough.  Loot drops are also interesting.  Not great, but they do provide enough incentive to push on through your campaign.  There is plenty to do in this title, and yes, even an endless type dungeon.\n\nYeah, there are some bugs.  Every game I have ever played has them.  This game doesn't make them stand out too badly.  There is some imrovements that need to be made to writing, and storyline and character creation, but overall from a one man band dev crew, I gotta' give this a great review.   If I were to put numbers to it, it would be a 7.5 out of 10.  A solid game, and a great take on the vampire world.\n\nNow, if the dev reads this:  To add an expansion pack with maybe some new classes and character creation with some new areas would really make this standout.  Otherwise, great work.\n\nSo get out there and sire some minions.\n\n","May 18","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Iinteresting things like quest givers actually getting mad and you failing the quest if you try to talk to them too much before finishing the quest. Awesome random loot.

I'm still early on at the time of my writing this in the story to really judge the plot, at the moment it's both in my opinion a bit open ended and a bit thin. I'm still a "fledgling" learning my roots and how to use my powers and the depth of how I can grow said powers is really awesome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wazabadoo/recommended/280600/","wazabadoo","wazabadoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wazabadoo/","259 products in account","TLDR: This game is an unpolished diamond. It has many many tiny flaws, but a lot of great features. Not for everyone, but heartily recommend.\n\nFirst of all, ignore the comparisons to diablo and V:TM. While some parts of Bloodlust certainly were inspired by those games, they are not anything alike. I would compare the "feel" of the gameplay more to the jedi knight series, with very little acrobatics. Instead, the game has a heavy focus of powering up your character and exploration. If you do not like taking your time to look under every nook and cranny, you will probably not like this game.\n\nAs an exclusively melee character, I feel I have experienced the worst of the game, and loved every minute of it. Here are the annoyances I've personnally met:\nHit reactions are a ♥♥♥♥♥\nsometimes it seems your hits just aren't doing damage (possibly because of unclear weapon range)\nWeapons break very easily, have to go inside a dungeon or craft expensive (relatively) items to repair them\nBeing swarmed is a ♥♥♥♥♥\nSome enemies are just harmless (but big) stacks of HP\nBackstab is ridiculously easy to pull off, but won't work against most enemies\nThe quest journal is unreliable, but you don't need it to do anything\nBut despite all this, the drive to explore new areas, to try and be liked by the various vampire clans, and to unravel the main story keeps you hooked.\n\nThe game could be explained as 2 parts: exploring and puzzle solving, and adventure dungeon delving.\n\nThe exploration is incredibly organic. You are introduced to most "exploration" powers in the first area, and only have to be attentive to details to figure out the solutions. You will have to leave some things behind, but when you unlock new powers, a solution to an old puzzle will spark. You will often wonder if the people you meet are allies or foes, and, depending on your actions, they might be either. You will have to be carful not to trespass on an unfriendly clan's territory, or at least not get caught doing it.\n\nWhen not exploring, you will be delving in a series of infinite randomized dungeons, fetching rare items npcs you want something from sent you to get, or simply getting better gear. The dungeons patterns are easy to recognize, although there are a few rarer rooms you might get that keeps things fresh. I only went to floor 16, which was deep enough for my purposes, and I am sure there are many things I did not see. There are 5 (to my knowledge) different dungeon tilesets, each with unique enemies and mini-bosses.\n\nPerhaps the most refreshing feature of the game is that it barely cares about balance. You start off weak, and can very well stay weak. If you are well versed in RPGs, I am sure you will have no trouble finding a build that works, and that is enough to complete the game. There is a "power ceiling" that you can break through, a turning point where you suddenly start kicking some serious ♥♥♥. There are various ways to attain this power, and no limits to the power you can attain. Powergamers can find a very satisfying experience in this game.\n\nYou have the option to persuade NPCs to advance the story, but you do not need much investment in the stat to fill the requirements for the whole game, especially with items that boost it. There is something of a stealth system, but no real rewards for it, nor much point to it. It's there, but it might as well be non-existent.\n\nAll in all, this is a very raw game experience that somehow manages to make me nostalgic despite being recently released. I can certainly see this game becoming a cult classic, and eagerly awaits whatever new projects WRF Studios work on.","September 30, 2015","true","32.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necroscourge/recommended/280600/","Necroscourge","Necroscourge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necroscourge/","495 products in account","So the obvious paralell for this game is Vampire: The Masqeurade, acting as a barely affiliated sequel. Storywise it's garbage, you wake up in a tomb with several NPC's with lame dialogue and are essentially hinted at several timest hat the Emperor is bad and must be replaced. You are referred to as a Fledgeling, and despite quickly having access to secret-finding eyesight you will be relying on a dinky flashlight for all vision. The Dev's claim because they call you something in game we are supposed to accept that fresh vampires can't see in the dark as if that's not completely rediculous. Any creature that is created through magic and only able to live at night can be assumed to see in the dark. If you turn your brain off and realize the Dev's have no idea what vampires of fables can and cannot do, this game is enjoyable.\n\nThe game would be more impressive if there was ever a good Vampire: The Masquerade game. Bloodlines was okay in that it was too linear for my tastes but otherwise pretty entertaining. But let us be brutally honest in this respect: WoD won't have a good game title while the entire community is split between the new and old darkness settings. In a way this is where Bloodlust shines, it's generic brand vampire angst. There are a few different vampire families, your class decides which likes you the most.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are fantastic because they explain the rules of the puzzles very early on and make it clear that there are a ton of them. Other games rarely commit to avid puzzle use, but Bloodlust embraces it. You have several abilities right at the beginning that allow you to explore the environment, including a spiritual ball you can use to remotely trigger switches (YET YOU CAN'T SEE IN THE FRIKKIN DARK!) which allows you to open up side passages filled with goodies. While the puzzles are good, when they say this game is mixed with Diablo they DO NOT mean the good ones from the series, they mean 3. Prepare to mindlessly stack attributes while filling up several talent and skill tree's. You end up needing all of them to some degree, so it's not as bad, but it's still pretty lame pseudo-rpg development.\n\nA "selling point" of the game is that it has a boring minion system that it pretends is an exciting family development mechanic. When you have a minion slot, if you bite a human they turn into a vampire and serve you. They can level up, do chores, and fight with you. Unfortunatly I don't know how to get rid of them, the tutorial entices you to turn an ugly bum when there are hot women on the surface to turn. Wading into combat didn't kill him, but it sure kills me. I wish the family mechanics were anywhere near as good as advertised, instead just being another generic mechanic with "vampire" written in permenant marker over it.\n\nIf you ignore everything but the general attitude and vibe of the game and love dungeon-crawling then you should be able to enjoy this game. Vampire fans of any kind will immediatly get frustrated at how badly the game portrays vampiric lore, especially World of Darkness fans. Everything vampiric in the game is a loose parody of a WoD concept down to them slipping up and referring to how vampires are made as the WoD term "The Embrace".\n\nIs the game worth $13? Yes. It's something you can play for a few hours at a time and just build up your character without having a big story thrusted onto you. What Bloodlust isin't would be a good RPG; Making numbers get bigger isin't enticing character devlopment, nor is picking from talent tree's. Your "minions" are just that, they are emotionless lackies. It's a run and gun dungeon crawler with a bunch of gameplay mechanics carrying a very loose vampire theme. And I guess that's okay.\n\nEDIT: Today the Dev added the ability to get rid of minions using cloves of garlic, so that is resolved. Be sure to upvote my truthful reveiws.","September 22, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Kind of a slow paced Diablo/Bloodlines cross.  Graphics arent great but they do the job.  Voice acting(what there is of it) isnt great but its not annoying, music is repetative but not really annoying either.   I guess the worst thing that can be said about this game is that it definately "feels" dated.  Not just the graphics either.  Combat is sluggish and charector movements are as well.  Oh and the landscape/backgrounds/surroundings are similar to that of much older 3D games.  Having said all that, I find the game fun to play in a relaxing sort of way.  If it had a bigger price tag, my advice would be to stay away from it for sure.  But at the price that I bought it for(6 bucks on sale), I definately recomend it.\n\nUpdate:  After playing the game for a little while longer, I am actually enjoying it MORE and not less.  I cant say that about many of the games that Ive paid much more money for.  My previous observations about the game are still true(at least to me).  The game does seem "dated" in many ways.  On the other hand, its a game that has been done well and the further that you get into it the more you actually like it.  One of the cool things that Ive discovered about the game is that you really need to invest in ALL your stats to do well(not like some games where you just max out only the couple of stats which are important to the class that you play).  Similarly, you will find most of the skills on your skill tree actually USEFULL.  You will USE a majority of them on a regular basis to play the game well.  Is this game worth the $12-$13 asking price?  Now that Ive played it for awhile, my opinion is YES.  It is.  Im glad that I got it on sale but again, in my opinion, you wont go wrong by paying full price for this either.

You also have times when the subtitles don't appear.\n\nThe character animations are terrible, the zombies pop out from nowhere and twitch like crazy when you hit them (same goes for your character when he gets hit). I managed to find a companion a few minutes in to the game and when I set him to "follow" he just floated around in a "T" pose.\n\nOh and I also had to unplug all my peripherals otherwise the mouse cursor would always fly to the left and get stuck there.\n\nThe game clearly has a few neat ideas, but it definitely needs a few more years in the oven.

I could understand if this was something from 2000 or before but this is a 2015 release and it's less polished than most early access games.\n\nOptions menu is abysmal though it doesn't matter since the game can play on any computer you've had laying around for 20 years. Skills are broken in some of the most unacceptable ways. (Summoning more than 1 rat can cause them to glitch inside of eachother and be unable to move.) The voices are pitiful, dialogue options seem relatively useless aside from always choose persuade if you have enough points.\n\nHow is the sire system though? That seems to be a big point of this game. Well, not too great either. Any command aside from "Follow me." is them just turning into a mist and disappearing to go pray to the RNG for something to give you. Aside from that there's a simplified version of your own stat system to give them and... That's about it.\n\nI was really hoping for a Bloodlines-esque game that was just made for modern-day but instead what I got was a less enjoyable experience in every way possible compared to Bloodlines.","September 22, 2015","false","1.4"," 30 of 69 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","30","69","0","15"

Amateur at best, on par with a high school mixing lab project; in a world where competent bedroom producers are a click away, there's no reason not to aim for better. Now that's not to say this wouldn't be reasonably excusable if the gameplay was of any worth, but in this case, it most certainly isn't.\n\nHonestly, I'd go so far as to consider the gameplay botched beyond belief, by far the most damning of all flaws, painfully slow, janky controls and borderline broken A.I. entirely baffling in their sheer levels of ineptitude. *This* is what ruins BloodLust Shadowhunter in its entirety, the proverbial fate-sealing nail on the coffin.\n\nLong story short -- stick with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines; a buggy mess, sure, but infinitely more enjoyable in comparison.","December 25, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

The forums show that a number of various crashes exist in the game but the developer is active in the forums and attempts to assist with suggestions to cure the problems encountered.  After trying his correction, I have played without a single crash occuring and am pushing level 30 whereas before I was restarting before even getting to level 6.  The game runs well without any lag.  Controls are simple and adjustable to an extent.  Character creation is fairly basic but the skill trees are varied and while I'm not sure, I think they are initially randomly set up as I recall on the different warrior classes I've made they all started out with different skill trees.  Maybe I'm confused about that though.
