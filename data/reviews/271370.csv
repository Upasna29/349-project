It's still the same great game it always has been. If you have played OpenTTD, TT , TTD, Railroad Tycoon 1-3,  It's not as good as those game but it has a similar feel.\n\nPros:\n\nDiversity in transporting good.\n\nLots of ways to transport goods.\n\nGood balance for micromanagement.\n\nCons:\n\nIn order to build new rail lines they have to be connected to the first line you made.\n\nBuilding Tracks and road can be a bit finicky buy once you get the hang of it, its eassy.","September 5, 2014","true","2.3"," 58 of 78 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","58","78","0","3"

I had envisioned a well polished 'modern' vision of the classic Transport Tycoon, instead what was presented was a somewhat watered down half-cooked revamp.\n\nOn the plus side it supports 'modern' wide-screen resolutions (to a point), however even those didn't seem fully supported as there was screen flickering and artifacts around menu text. The game feels very slow and awkward when navigating around the 'huge' maps (which aren't as HUGE as I'd have liked). I appreciate this game isn't about animations or breath taking graphics and lightning, yet it doesn't capture the charm that the Transport Tycoon had with it's design and spites. Something just feels... lacking.\n\n"Ingenious signalling and guidance system for trains" isn't really that ingenious considering it's been used elsewhere before and after this game was made, released and re-relesaed.\nFurther more there's no tutorial for this 'ingenious' system, which is all fine and well for veterans of the series who can sort of understand and work it out for themself, but will leave newcomers totally bewildered.\nIn fact there's no real on-screen help or prompts at all - not even pop-up tool tips, so if you are a newcomer to the genre I wouldn't recommend this at all, simply as it's not going to help you get used to the game/genre mechanics.\n\nAt this point in time, I regret buying this game. I might have had a little more hope and belief for improvement it was an Early-Access game.\nTempted to request refund and spend the little extra on a similar game currently in Early-Access, as I have more hope it'll be supported and developed beyond this game's current state.\n\nOverall at the current price of just under £10 (discounted) seems way too much for a poorly optimised retro game that somehow feels like an Early-Access game. I would have been way more forgiven if this had been £5 on GOG, or a clearly labeled Early-Access release (at least then I'd have hopes for improvements over time).","September 7, 2014","false","0.5"," 74 of 115 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","74","115","0","9"

While challenging, it was also fun to play and I spent many hours completing the campaigns. Unfortunately, since it's been released on Steam, I haven't had much success or fun with it. The first three laptops I tried to install it to and play it on were not successful. I had the flickering issue on the main menu page --which didn't clear up and there's no help or bug fix to resolve it. On the third laptop, I was finally able to play it for awhile and saved several missions --but then had a different issue where the game would crash. Now I'm on my fourth and final laptop and playing it in compatibility mode for windows 7. No crashes yet, but have to replay each campaign because although all my saved games may be played, it doesn't let me advance to the next level until I open and complete the previous levels. So unfortunately I can't recommend this game at this time. If there is some better support for different graphics drivers and game crashes in the future, then maybe.","April 25, 2015","false","103.1"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","27","38","0","0"

It felt like the game was running at 10-20 fps (20 fps with game on normal speed, on max speed (8x) it felt closer to 10 fps).\n\nThen there are some problems with the interface. Even though it is an older game, it is no excuse to release it in this state. Several interactions are very unlogical. You have to start a campaign using the enter button (you cannot double-click it), but there are no hints about what you had to do after selecting the US compaign. The screen that follows requires you to press an OK button and enter doesn't work anymore.\n\nAnother problem I'm having is moving over the map, you can use the arrow keys but this is very choppy and slow. You can also use the right mouse button that is smooth and fast, but when you are working on something (road/schedule) and you right click the mouse the current action gets cancelled and you can start over. As a result, when you are creating a schedule you might want to zoom out first, otherwise moving around the map is very tedious.\n\nThere are many of these inconsistencies in the interface and with the lack of a tutorial it might be hard to find out what you actually need to get starting. That said, once you figure everything out it does not become such a problem anymore. The performance, however, needs to be fixed. I also noticed some other bugs, one in particular is that you can build modern airfields and chopper platforms around the 1850's, but you cannot build the planes and choppers yet (for obvious reasons).\n\nI do recommend this game if they fix the performance. In the current state, wait until they do.","September 6, 2014","true","1.1"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","0"

Now, it's not great but it's better then when I'm running at 1920x1200. Hope that helps.*******\n\nUnfortunately this game does not, at this time, receive my recommendation because the game performs like garbage. It really upsets me to see this great title being defamed in this manner. Everything that is great about this game has been there since the original game and United Independent Entertainment GmbH has taken that exact game, made some nice little additions, allowed for HD widescreen resolutions and that seems to be about it.  At any speed, moving around the map is near impossible, it stutters and jerks about, sometimes continuing to move around long after I’m done pressing the left or right key. Needless to say this performance issue is pretty severe and I’d imagine that we won’t hear anything from the developers in the form of a response regarding this seemingly widespread issue, but I’m hoping this is one of those “feel good” gaming stories where the Scumbag Steve actually ends up being the good guy Greg.\nOn the bright side I love what this game was and would love to be able to play it in “HD” without having to quit in frustration because the game cannot handle moving about the map. If this issue is addressed and patched you can be sure I’ll be recommending this game.","September 5, 2014","false","4.0"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","29","47","0","0"

Nice features for a small game and a lot of opitons for a great transportnetwork.\n\nThis game is simular to the 2004 game Transport Giant Gold Edition.\nThere are a few new feautures who are added on. And the tool to zoom out/in has become a great tool to oversee your map!\nWhat I realy miss in this steam version: " the competitors ". When you start a random map/free to play, the game asks you how many compeditors you want to add on, but they never show to your list of competitors. With this big miss no one can make a nice strategy to overpower the map and take-over other competitors.\n\nWhat the builders could think about:\n- add on competitors\n- real-life signs: like orange : the trains might go pass the signal but wiht a lower speed\n- new bridges with the option for tonages (it forces to the player to make a strategy)\n- separate the look of the industries between continents. The city's have a diffirent look but not the industries (the wheat farms for example are in a American style. In real life European farms don't have those)\n\nOverall it is simular to the 2004 game. A few new things are added on but also the big loss of compediotors.\nIf you want to create your own transportroutes this might be a nice game for you.","October 17, 2014","true","136.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Strange, but it's OK, I have played railroad tycoon, Can't be much different.\n\nBefore I go much further, I must say that I did not expect this game to be visually pleasing, I was expecting something low spec. And I was not disappointed, with old 16bit block graphics style game play smoothed off a bit.\n\nBut that aside, I started playing, I choose an open play "sandbox" style of UK, and I started from the beginning, 1850.\nWow was I wrong about it not being too hard to pick up, I have a total of less than ten hours on this game, The first two was setting up a transport link and trying to set up a route.\n\nAfter all that, I was suddenly drawn to how much it had cost me, How much it was costing me to maintain buildings, And how much I was loosing on each run!\n\nAfter a few more hours setting up different trade routes It struck me as how hard it was to make any money, I was just keeping afloat mostly,\n\nStarting from the 1850's I only had access to horse and cattle, a few years on I got a train and some ships, One of which was 6.5MILLION!!! to buy, you start the game with 15M and I was fast down to less than one million, So I fast forwarded time to gain some funds, and for some reason, The white house appeared in Cornwall? Quirky.\n\nI also noticed at this point the lack of transport options, I was still in "horse and cart" mode, Starting on my railway, I did a long link between two factories, That was great fun and was a money earner, I was back up to a few mill in no time, So I went to do another rail link.....And For some reason, I cannot place another station anywhere on the map? I looked this up on the internet and apparently it is a bug, And to my surprise, one of MANY! No, Seriously!\n\nMany of the bugs I have not come across yet, But this along with no hover over tool tips, The inability to do roads/rail in 8 directions (can only be done 4 directions) and the awkwardness of setting up routes (route manager disappears when you move the map with the mouse, you have to use the arrow keys!) just makes the game look underdeveloped.\n\nI have reluctantly decided to call it a day for this game, And it cost me a GBP £10.99, Steam will not give back money for you buying rubbish that they offer, You have been warned, Please research what you can about a game before you give it to steam.\n\nIt might sound a little harsh, If you decide to put up with all the flaws, your a better person than me, I just can't play this game.\n\nThank you for your time.","October 8, 2014","false","10.6"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","4"

When you're almost done planning out your train's route you accidentally press the right-mouse button and boom, all effort gone! :(\nPerformance wise it's okay, unless you zoom out fully, which made my game run at 2 fps, not really enjoyable.\n\nI recommend saving up an extra €10 and buy Train Fever instead.\nMaybe if you really like 2D games or just love the nostalgia like me you should buy it.","February 9","false","3.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Not sure about OS below that, but when I launch, the game crashes.  There is no fix that I have been able to find anywhere.  No help from developer and of course, no help from Steam (you can't even submit a ticket, the game does is not recignized by Steam support system).  DO NOT BUY if you have windows 8.  If you have OS below that, better do your research because you will loose your money (of course, you can't get a refund even though it says that it supports windows 8).  I did get it to work one time after a complete reinstall of graphics card driver software, but even then, the menus would work fine for a few minutes then when you try to open them you get nothing but text, no selection boxes to back out even.   Hitting esc anywhere will end game and take to main menu.\n\nThe 5 minutes I got to play the game are not enough to even start to evaluate the game, so I can't even go there, youtube will show all the gameplay you need to descide if you want to risk it.\n\nSucks when Steam advertises a game to be compatible with an OS and it is not and they will not even give you your money back, instead, you just loose the money.  Also, I have not been able to find anyway to contact the developer about this.  Nordic games has been around a while, odd that you can't contact them (or that there is no google term to get you to them).\n\nThis is the last game that I will buy that is supposedly "revamped" for Steam and windows 8, these developers do nothing to fix problems, just create more and take your money.   Considering that I had ony the $15 that this game costs to spend and I got taken, I am a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with Steam and their lack of ovesight with games that they sell.  You would think that the person that lets the game to be sold here would try it out on the OS that it supposedly supports (at least the newest listed when the game is as old as this (2004)).\n\nBEWARE ALL WIN 8 USERS!\n\nUsing a gtx660 OC with quad core i7 and socket 2011 Asus Sabertooth X79 Mobo, so the game should work with my machine (all drivers are up to date and all the rest of the usual culprits have been eliminated as suspects).\n\nLost all respect for nordic games after buying this one, they really took me to the cleaners.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigertrix/recommended/271370/","tigertrix","TigerTrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigertrix/","578 products in account","The game is "OK", for those who truly like transport games (Transport Tycoon / Locomotion), but with a lot of micro-management that takes work in the UI.  There is a learning curve and some clunky controls at first, but then the game works once you understand the mechanics.  There is no tutorial, and it is rather confusing at first to figure out how to setup 2 depots, setup routes, and have things run efficiently enough to finish in the scenario expected timeline.  In my first play of 80 minutes, I frequently ALT+TABed between the user manual linked from steam, and watched a video walkthrough of the frist level.  It gave me a headache, and I about gave up.  But once I understood the mechanics, I started over on the scenario on the second day, and now I could control it well and won the first scenario.  If you aren't a fan of transport games, this is probably not the first such game to try.  But if you like the concept, and watch someone else play a walkthrough, then you get how it works and can have some fun.\n\nWorks great on my Alienware Alpha (i7) with Windows 10, full screen on my 1080p TV (smaller window until you adjust the settings to 1080), has not crashed during my initial sessions.  What I like about the game is it starts in 1850, and really makes you use Ox / horse carts to achieve the mission.  Then in the 2nd scenario it gets into trains.  They are picky too, because you might forget to tell it to stop at a station in reverse order on the way back, run out of water and crawl, or forget to specify which items to pick up and lose money.  Laying track isn't "fun" either, and is a bit of work, but is serviceable.\n\nA few tips for things I didn't understand at first:\n1. You must build truck depots, you can only schedule things between your depots.  Put them in an area that overlaps (and turns buildings green) that you want to handle goods.  You can have multiple depots servicing the same building from the shared stock, and may be more efficient with less traffic.\n2. Pay attention to the right & left arrows at the top of menus.  They are the key things that purchase (move to the right side of menu), or add a vehicle to a schedule (move to the left).\n3. Still in scheduler, click each depot to add it to the route list, BUT you are not done.  Also beware of scrolling by dragging with the mouse righ-click and pull as it exits the scheduler menu, but arrow keys work, zoom out, and pan by mouse to the edge works.\n4. Still in scheduler, select the depot that services the goods to pick up, and you *MUST* select the good to pick up, click the left arrow to add it, *BUT* only for the station to pick up from.  You can also select the up arrow (wait-for-full-load) on the first stations and select the down arrow (wait-for-unload) on the second station.  You might think you select the good to unload, but if you keep it selected on the second station it will not unload.\n5. You can easily duplicate routes by clicking the duplicate button instead of the checkmark.  It took me forever until I realized this.  Also, once a route is created, you can duplicate existing routes by a single click if you select a vehicle on the route, as long as you have enough vehicles left unused.  Once I got this, it got a lot easier.\n\n"OK" for the transport enthusiest, when on sale.  But is hard to recommend.  A mild thumbs-down.","January 10","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And i like it! The new UI-design looks really better than in the original version of the game (10years ago). And it supports 1080p resolution with 120hz, really great!\n\nJust dont use the new superzoom-function, this will cause the game to get little bit laggy. But if you play it at the common zoom level, its really stable and stable, even in 1080p.\n\nIf you liked the game in the past, just buy it- it´s now worth the money.","November 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it about 10 years ago when JoWood first released it.  It also came with an editor in which you could build a multitude of different 'unique' buildings requiring different materials.  However this isn't included with the Steam Version.\n\nThe Campaign missions for the US and Europe are the same as the original game. I haven't played the Australian missions before this release, so that's all new to me, however i know they were also released as an add-on a couple of years after the original game came out (I bought the add-ons but my crappy computer at the time wouldn't even recognise the discs).\n\nPros for the game is it's diversity of starting points. If you start in 1850, it's with horse and cart, simple ships, and a 'horse train' options. As you start in later years, more updated modes of transportation become available. Road quality is just a gravel road in the 1850's, but can improve to Autobahn standard later in the game. An endless number of maps can be created depending on what type of game you want to play, from a mountainous continent to a small island archipeligo and everything in between.\n\nI love the view of the game. There are plenty of in-game options eg if trees confuse the view, or the names listed are in the way, then you can simply remove from your view by clicking on the appropriate button on the bottom of the screen. Discrete but effective.  I always remove the trees, they dont really serve a purpose in the game except to clutter the screen. The mini-map is movable or can be removed from view is you require. I personally leave it in the upper right corner as it becomes a quick guide to locations.\n\nThe only part of the game that bugs me is the train connection system.  If you start a line, then future additional railway lines additions MUST come from the lines already placed.  There is no other way to create a new railway line. If you want to create a line on an separate part of the map, then it must join with an existing line before it can be built. Many a time I have wanted to create a railway line far away form my original line, but have had to use other forms of transport, or spend a lot of money on getting a virually useless line to my new setup.\n\nI haven't had any screen issues as what may potentially happen as per the game page. The game seems to run as it did many years ago.\n","January 16","true","46.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At a glance the routing and schedule making system may seem broken, or overly complicated, but with just a little patience you can figure it out.  Another way to help with that is to watch the one-off lets play of this game by PewPewChewChew on Youtube.  Though there are a few performance problems with later OS, they dont seem incrediably game-breaking.  Occassionally the game will freeze for a few seconds (literally 1 or 2 sec) whilst routing vehicles and such, you cant go clicking things quickly because the delay between the click of the mouse and the implimentation of the click in game WILL lead to buildings being placed incorrectly, but PATIENCE is a virtue.  The only major thing I have incountered is that occasionally, usually after scrolling in to fast (which the game processes REALLY slowly compared to scrolling out and other things) AND clicking things a tad quickly the game will have a permenant (from my experiance) brain-fart that prevents you froming interacting with the UI (you can still move the mouse and check on map info, and the vehicles still move and make money so the game is not frozen) which prevents your from really continuing the game (escape key does not even do anything) so you will have to Ctrl-Alt-Del out of the program and restart the game, which will make the UI fully functional again.  With that in mind I can not stress enough SAVE EARLY AND SAVE OFTEN.  We all know it is not fun when we make lots of progress and suddenly a game crashes and we lose all that beautiful unsaved progress.  Otherwise the gameplay is just the right combination of Complex and Simple that we saw so often in older titles, but sadly lacks in more modern games.  The game is highly reminiscent of Chris Sawyer's Locomotion, but in a more (I would say) completed and flushed-out state, with things like company takeovers (Note it says you can do it and I have seen it mentioned in game, I have never attempted this myself)\n\nIN SUMMERY\n\nDo buy if.....\n-you like indepth transport/tycoon games\n-enjoy creating/developing complex systems of roads, tracks, airlines, and shipping lanes\n-have patience\n-can cope with a few minor issues of functionallity\n-enjoy a wide frame of history\n-If you like Industrial Giant 2 and Chris Sawyer's Locomotion (my personal fav)\n\nDon't buy if.....\n-You NEED the best of cutting edge graphics\n-Have ZERO tolerance for lag/momentary freezing/and semi-"Crash"-type thingys\n-Don't enjoy slower gameplay\n-Have little to no Patience\n-Don't enjoy games with a moderate degree of complexity","January 14","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Initially I played it as a demo and got very curious( when i was younger I used to play Transport Tycoon Deluxe followed by Industry Giant 2). These kind of games are quite rare(complex ones like TG,TTD,IG2 even rarer). The game puts you in the position of a owner having plenty of cash to start a Transport bussiness with the ultimate goal being to become a Transport Giant. You can extend on many fields of transport (at first horses,trains,trucks,ships,blimps,etc) and carry all kinds of goods (from people to steel). The game is mostly based on a classic system of supply and demand. You can play in 3 different places (USA,EUROPE,AUSTRALIA). The interface and setting up can be a burden at first but once you get used to it you won't have any problem. The biggest 2 minuses so far to the game(mentioned in cons) are : Inactive AI and the new interface.","April 24","true","45.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
