In all you get 60 very well-designed levels, which equals about twice the length of DOOM II, or nearly the combined length of DOOM II and THE ULTIMATE DOOM. It’s highly recommended you play those two games before touching this one.\n\nFINAL DOOM adds literally no new mechanics or anything to the table. It’s kind of just an extension of DOOM II -- sort of like the difference between SUPER MARIO BROS. and SUPER MARIO BROS. 2 THE LOST LEVELS. Another reason the comparison is apt is because of FINAL DOOM’s increased difficulty over id Software’s original creations.\n\nWhat makes the maps in FINAL DOOM so good is that they were designed specifically for people who’ve already completed the first two games and are thus already highly accustomed to how DOOM works. The fan levels manipulate enemies, items, and the gimmicks of DOOM in ways beyond what id explored.\n\nBetween the two megawads, “TNT Evilution” in particular manages to feel tough but fair. It spends a lot of time using enemies in ways DOOM and DOOM II didn’t prepare you for, messing with preconceived notions and tactics that may have gotten you through those games.\n\nYou may end up in tight quarters with a Hell Knight or a corridor with a Revenant, subverting how you usually fight against them. Despite stuff like this, the levels are designed to where you can always find new ways to deal with old problems. In this way TNT manages to always keep you guessing.\n\nThe other megawad -- “The Plutonia Experiment” -- on the other hand, feels a little bit cheap in my opinion. It definitely feels possible to beat, but ramps up the difficulty pretty much as soon as you begin and puts you in a lot of downright crappy situations without warning. Whereas TNT gradually ramps up the grade of enemies and weapons, Plutonia throws Revenants and Mancubuses at you on its first level. I also think it overuses chaingunners. If you’re a stubborn kind of gamer you can still enjoy it, but it’s noticeably more frustrating than TNT.\n\nFINAL DOOM is sort of like an ultimate mastery of old school DOOM, its levels making the most of DOOM’s mechanics and requiring the most of the skills you developed in the original two games. That, and being basically twice the content of an actual official DOOM game, make it one the most valuable collections of commercial fan content around.","February 24, 2014","true","12.0"," 128 of 130 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","128","130","4","3"

Two new episodes, Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment with 32 maps each, 64 maps in total. Complete with its own custom soundtrack, a conclusion to the original Doom story. It is essentially a Doom 3, before Doom 3.\n\nTeam TNT and the Casali Brothers did an outstanding job on the maps for both episodes. If you thought that Doom 1 or Doom 2, or even the Master Levels in Doom 2 weren't challenging enough, pick this game up. It's definitely worth your money.\n\nIf you want even more of a challenge, play this on Black Metal difficulty in Brutal Doom or Ultimate Complexity (I think that's the name) difficulty on Complex Doom.

For example:\n- Lossless gameplay\n- Nostalgia\n- (Pretty) Simple game controls.\n\nLossless gameplay:\nMeans that the game has nothing that breaks the gameplay at any point. You press "New Game", then you're already in the game. Nothing in the middle at all. And that's how the game is all the way until the end (Because then you've finished it).\n\nNostalgia:\nIt speaks for itself. If you're familiar with the 90's FPS games, this will have effect. As the game was released in 1996 (As I said before), the way the game looks like and is played is like all the other game from the 90's. Note that the game has a lot of secrets and tricks. These will help when you need it, but you need to find them first (The best way is to just mash space at all the walls in the room).\n\n(Pretty) Simple game controls:\nThe buttons used aren't many. Arrow keys, W, A, S, D, Control (Ctrl), Shift, Alternative (Alt), Space. If you want (Highly recommended), you can activate the mouse by pressing the scroll wheel. Then you can look around with the mouse and shoot with Left Click. You'll find this really useful, as it's easier to aim at the enemy with this setup.\n\nAlso, the game is really hard. But here's some helpful hints you can have use of:\n- Move. Like an idiot. The most lethal shots are not instant, and sends a projectile that can be avoided.\n- Use multiple save slots. Using only one can get you in trouble.\n- Scavenge. If you're low on health, go back and try to pick up stimpacks and first aid kits left behind. Try also to find secrets.\n- Pay attention to sounds. If you do, you can sometimes foresee if there's an enemy behind a door or not.\n- Save frequetly. Every time you've cleaned a room, save. If you're low on health, save in a different save slot.\n\nThis is not necessary, but I recommend using ZDoom instead of the original game. Why is because it runs much smoother and looks much better. ZDoom is also free, but requires you to buy the original game first (Otherwise it doesn't have the files required to run the game).","June 29, 2014","true","74.7"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","6"

By challenging I do mean challenging.  The first levels are packed with some of the hardest enemies in the game, none of the slowly introducing enemies throughout the levels while you pack up on ammo and weapons that you'd find in Doom or Doom 2.  Save frequently because you never know what is going to trigger a mass spawn of enemeis when you're least expecting it.\n\nOnly cons would have to be the graphics which are somehow slightly more pixelated than the original and the weird controls.

The levels featured in this standalone 'expansion' were designed in mind for people who had completed the original two DooM games on Ultra-Violence and were looking for more of a challenge.\n\nFinal DooM not only achieved what they set out to do but did it with class. There are some terrifically obscure masterpieces among this collection and the difficulty these maps provide generally doesn't come from swamping the player with massive hordes of enemies, but from cheap/clever monster placement.\n\nThis offers a far greater challenge seen in the original two games, so much so that if you were comfortable with completing the originals on Ultra-Violence without 'Save Scumming' or dying once throughout entire playthroughs this would be sure to kick your ♥♥♥ atleast a few times... hard... While there are a few maps here I disliked slightly, the good ones far overshadow them and progression welcomes you to new, unique challenging combat situations which bear a demonic grin while trying to brutally slaughter you.\n\nFinal DooM should be played on Ultra-Violence or higher, playing it on anything easier defeats the purpose, if you feel it's too hard, rather practice with the originals until you get good enough to do so to appreciate and experience the full terror and panic the level designers have laid out for you. All in all some brilliant levels and high challenge is the centre point of this game, of which it achieves flawlessly.

It was about you fighting through hordes of demons, and it was released for DOS. But now, they've ported new WADs into it and ported it into Steam and PC! Now you can pay 5.99 for two WADs!\n\nSo, Plutonia isn't too bad, the levels can be quite challenging and they aren't too puzzling. But, the difficulties for some of these levels are just rediciously stupid. It's like, for example: Level 1 was hard, then Level 2 is easy, then Level 3 is hard again. It's sorta like that, just a continued pattern over and over again of difficulty. The puzzles can be also quite random, like for example (again), what if you had to do a speed-boost jump to get a keycard? Either way, this one isn't too bad.\n\nTNT: Evilution is another fun one. If I had to pick between the two, it'd be TNT. The levels are fun to do, it's not too hard or easy, and the puzzles are good.\n\nOverall, this game is great, it's worth the 5.99 and you can even play with the classic controls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2290/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Final Doom is a stand-alone huge mission pack based on Doom 2 in 1996. Or more exactly, it consist of two big IWADs, both having 32 levels, both fan-made, both not bringing anything new or changing core gameplay. And both are harder than your average Doom 2. The names of these two level packs are TNT Evilution and Plutonia Experiement.\nIt also had a PS1 port, which takes only some of Final Doom levels, puts some levels from Master Levels, toned down difficulty and then applied a dark horror-like atmoshpere to it, with low brightness and ambient music. I feel that it's much superior experience for those who aren't complete Doom 2 fans, instead of dragging thorugh 64 levels.\n\nAs usual, Steam version was handled in same way as other Steam versions of classic Doom games. That means "badly".\nOnce again you have to edit "ddraw" line to "opengl" in conf files to make DosBox run without lags. Adn once again setup.exe wasn't included, so you have to manually edit cfg files for controls and music. Yes, uses Soundblaster by default too. At least Steam still gives you option between "classic" and "with mouse" control scheme when launching game.\nSpecially for Final Doom, configuration isn't the only thing that got screwed up. You see, in Steam version both level packs use same exe file. And that exe is from Plutonia. Not every data is kept in wad file, some were in exe too. What it means is that TNT Evilution uses Plutonia's story for occasional text intermission and it shows Plutonia's level name on same slot on level's automap.\nOh, and they share save slots too. Loading another's pack save crashes the game. You better be careful not to screw up progress by overwriting wrong save is you are beating both packs.\n\nNow, for gameplay of those two packs themselves:\nMade me want to yank Chaingunners out of Doom mappers hands, along with their arms. 10/10\nJust kidding. Well, at least this common complaint it true for both packs.\n\nTNT Evilution is slightly harder than Doom 2 and is uncertain of what kind of level style it wants to have. It's quite a mix, not exactly all fun one. It can't decide if it wants to have tricky "gotcha" maps, hard crowd stuff, linear layout or confusing mazes. Maps 19 and 20 are really something, as they get out from Doom's abstract style and look like a real place, with office rooms, truck, what looks like actual warehouse boxes processing. It's actually quite nice. And then pack will throw you into huge empty level. So yes, uncertain. It does make use of new textures though, here and there, most memoriable being blood patches on occasional wall. It also includes new music, which helps to give it a personality. They aren't bad either.\n\nPlutonia Experiement is a different beast, that wants to rip you apart. It's more in line with Doom 2 style, only slightly less dull and brown. Mazes are also complex, but in a good way, it doesn't make you run over map in search for a hidden button. It also rarely uses new textures of green color, as well as reuses Doom 1 music. So, in some ways it's a bit better than Doom 2 when it comes to level design. Heck, it even has a map that is maze, filled with archviles that are aware of your existance, hunting you down as you figure out the ways that various doors are opened.\nAnd it's also hard. It's a main point of this IWAD actually, to be hard. And cheap, occasionally, not going to forget situation where I was teleport in front of two teleporting archviles, that you can't break a line of sight from unless you decide to just run away into near pit and try to snipe from down there. So yes, it's very hard, which in PC gaming with saving means abusing quicksaves every few seconds, not the most pleasent grinding.\n\nMultiplayer doesn't seem to be supported by Steam version. You should use Zandronum source port for that. Eh, you will figure it out by yourself.\n\nI actually wanted to not recommend this game at first, since it's kinda more of same Doom 2 but harder, didn't see appeal of playing 60 more freaking levels that hate you. But that was before I properly played it in single-player.\nAfter beating it, I can say that Doom 2 gameplay is still fun, even if using Super Shotgun on everything and having Chaingunner in every room gets repetive. So yes, Doom nuts should get this one.","May 5, 2015","true","13.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

To have the best experience with the final doom episodes, I highly recommend you download a launcher called zdoom, which is free, which will provide loads of customization to the controls and it will make the final doom playable on both windows 10 and 8. There is a link below to zdoom.\n\nWhat I liked about the game\n•	Loads of cool levels. 64 levels in total, 4 of those are secret levels. You get a lot for £3.99, well worth the money. My favourite episode was TNT: Evilution.\n•	Loads of secrets to be found throughout the game.\n•	You can play this game with brutal doom or project brutality, which I highly recommend.\nWhat I disliked or was disappointed with\n•	Some of the levels are ridiculously hard. If I were you I would play both doom and doom 2 first on ultra violence before you play final doom. I would also recommend you play evilution first before Plutiona\n•	The final boss fights are disappointing and very challenging.\n•	The secret levels on plutiona aren’t very good and are ridiculously hard.\nMy conclusion\nFinal doom is very challenging. If you liked doom and doom 2 and you are looking for more of a challenge, I highly recommend you play this game. Make sure you try out brutal doom and project brutality.\n70/100\n\n\nZdoom\n\nhttp://zdoom.org/Download\n\nBrutal doom\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom\n","May 23","true","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Starting up the Steam shortcut will actually attempt to open your CMD prompt and run DOSbox. Unless your running this off a dinosaur, your computer probably can't run DOSbox very well, and you will need to use a DOOM emulator, such as Zandronum[zandronum.com], GZDOOM[www.osnanet.de] or Chocolate DOOM[www.chocolate-doom.org]. If it says I have 0 hours on record, I don't, I've just been playing the game off of Zandronum.\n\nWith that out of the way, any DOOM or DOOM II fan needs to buy this. The WAD files are extractable for Ports or Modding, and the level design is for the most part pretty good. TNT has easier, more colorful, less consistant maps, while Plutonia has harder, brown-ish, and consistant maps. There isn't much else to say, because the game otherwise runs exactly like DOOM II would.

I think its one of the few classics FPS's that still hold up well today and i've played it and DOOM II dozens of times.  But Final DOOM is not a good game.\n\nFinal DOOM feels more like a mod.  like it was a fan made game designed to be as frustrating as possible.  This game pulls all the worst kind of ♥♥♥♥ moves.  It will start the level by teleporting you in surrounded by enemies, it will have massive ambushes come out of nowhere all the time, it will throw death traps at you that will require you to die before you know its there.  Enemies are placed in such a way as to be as big of a pain as possible.  There are chaingun zombies EVERYWHERE!!! and they will snipe you from across the screen.  there are a couple of levels that are basically nothing but tiny stepping stone walk ways over a huge acid pit. and to top things off there is even a level that forces you to cross a chasim via an invisible walkway that you just have to know is there.\n\nI like challenging games but this was just a slog.  every level takes forever and you will spend more time pressing quick save and quick load then pulling the trigger.\n\nThere are a handful of okay levels.  one that takes place in a city block is kinda neat and there are a couple of "hardcore" hidden levels that are basically waves of cyber demons and minions but the majority of the levels are going to test your patience rather than you skill.   I only beat the game to see if there was somting neat at the end.  Nope.  they use the last boss from DOOM II but in a more dickish level and then its the same boring "you beat the game" text scroll followed by the role call where you shoot each of the game enemies and then your self over and over again.\n\nThis game wasn't fun even with the the brutal DOOM mod  I can't even imagine how much it must suck playing it the normal way and not being able to aim up or down because most of the enemies are at different elevations in this game.\n\nsave yourself a headach and skip the damn thing.","October 2, 2015","false","19.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

As already mentioned in my other DooM reviews the 0/10 rate is related to the Steam Release. Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). All of this to state I know and Love the game I grew up with. Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically The Ultimate DooM, DooM II: Hell On Earth and Master Levels for DooM II Bonus Pack. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.\n\nThis Pack includes the 2 famous TNT Evilution and the Plutionia Experiment expansions. Both made of 32 maps still my favourite one is the TNT pack as it's the only one that used original music, which is really badass or gives great atmosphere. I'll just copy-paste the cons of the other releases, which still apply on this one. It's not worth a total rewrite...\n\n+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this Game EXPANSION. More levels for one of the first and most loved FPS. They kind of renew the level design with some tricks or challenges (a Cyberdemon in the very first level of TNT at the highest difficulty levels... XD).\nMUSIC. This is my personal favourite aspect for the TNT expansion pack. I love those songs so much I've even played some covers on youtube. Nothing beats the first level track, as in DooM or DooM II, but they still rock B-)\nMODS & COMMUNITY. Yes, a huge enormous load of mods, levels and so on. There are even lots of custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam. STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work.\nTHE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT "Modern input" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And "Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD...

Best gun by far was the Super Shotgun. The lighting effects on the PSX was top notch.\n\nI prefer the PS1 version to the PC for reasons such as the soundtrack was more atmospheric on the PS1 whilst the PC didn't fit the atmosphere at all.

I actually made a steam account 2 years ago and must've had the doom games on my wishlist because a month ago I received an email notifying me that a game on my wishlist was on sale. Excited, I create a new steam account because I couldn't remember the details for my old one, and I buy this just to be extremely disappointed. Maybe the version I downloaded was glitched or I don't know but damn the music is just... it sounds so cheap. Nothing like the original music. The graphics are so awful I can't distinguish shotgun dudes from walls, and the controls.. oh the controls. I move with wasd and look with the mouse, but I also move with the mouse? Why? I'm also slightly peeved because my refund for this game was denied. I highly recommend just buying the BFG edition if you want to play the original dooms. The quality of these doom games are pretty awful. I had to stop playing after 8 minutes because I just could not stand how utterly terrible everything looked.","December 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","5"

This is probably older than the version you played in the 90s, if you ran a windows 9x port.\n-No OpenGL.\n-No DirectX.\n-480p only, no widescreen support so the whole game is stretched unless you make your monitor squish the picture.\n-Final DOOM contains two mission packs which are fun for the hardcore doom player, but much too unforgiving for casual players.\n-Level Design just isn't as good as DOOM 1 and 2 irrespective to difficulty and other concerns\n\nPros:\n-My mouse is actually detected and the old 1-handed mouse movement/aiming scheme still works wonderfully. I mention this because it doesn't work in any other version of DOOM on steam.\n\nThis is slightly better than other DOOM games on steam emulation-wise, but it's still the dos version running in an emulator. To make matters worse, this is the weakest of the original DOOM engine games.\n\nI recommend Final DOOM, but not the version Steam is selling. Buy this on GOG or track down the DOOM classics CD-Rom and get a source port.","July 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmed/recommended/2290/","thesmed","Smeddy Too","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmed/","240 products in account","This game is a total ripoff. The game does not truly signify an ending to the Doom series. Although the gameplay is very close to it's source material, the story is very, very inconsistant. In the first expansion, The Plutonia Experiment, Doomguy plays the role of a man suffering through PTSD as he fights demons through a visage of 1960's Vietnam. The texturing is very grassy and lifelike, and it has a forest-like theme going for it. However, the plot can be greatly considered non-canon and I do not at all like to say it is a part of the Doom lore.\nTNT: Eviliution is the second included expansion, and it stars as Doomguy going to the depths of Hell after subjecting himself to male prostitution. The plot is very close to the series Call Of Duty: Black Ops and the gameplay is reminiscent of Wolfenstien 3D: The New Enemy Territory. However, the plot again does not fit the Doom canon and I decree that both expansions are total crap. 11/10","July 18, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They were added to The Ultimate DOOM instead. :P)\n\nFinal DOOM is a compliation pack of two mod campaigns for DOOM II that were bought by id Software and then released. The pack consists of TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. TNT: Evilution shows off some nice sci fi textures similar to the early levels of DOOM and DOOM II. It is moderately difficult and is enjoyable. The Plutonia Experiment is in my opinion, the hardest official DOOM campaign I have ever played. Traps are everywhere and the brothers who created it must have really liked Chaingunners because they are everywhere. The first batch of levels throw tons of enemies at you and with the starting weapons it can be rage inducing at times. The difficultty lowers a bit though as you get better weapons and move through the campaign. I recommend TNT: Evilution to everyone but The Plutonia Experiment only to hardened veterans of DOOM. All the weapons and enemies from DOOM II are present and there are 32 levels per campaign for a total of 64 levels. Enjoy ripping and tearing through this one. ;)","July 25, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only played Doom 1, but I've seen gameplays of Final Doom on YouTube and that already made it my favorite Doom game, because it has the weapons and demons from Doom II and still takes place on another planet, other than Earth, so I had to play it for myself. But after I first installed it, it was always very hard to get started up and whenever I would get it started up, it would lag a lot, the doors wouldn't always open, and just like in Doom 1, there was no way to change the controls in the Options menu, since it was made back when joysticks were commonly used, which makes it a lot harder for me to play. But I was planning to install the Brutal Doom mod to it, anyway. So, I installed the source port, Zandronum, to my computer, then copied and pasted the .WAD files of Final Doom to the Zandronum folder, and then extracted the files of Brutal Doom to the Zandronum folder, and not only did Brutal Doom work on Final Doom, but Zandronum also made Final Doom much more playable, making it much easier to start up, getting rid of the lagging, fixing the doors, and adding way more options in the Options menu, including options for the controls, so now, I can actually have fun, playing Final Doom with or without Brutal Doom. And it's still my favorite Doom game.","January 25, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pure unadulterated ultra-violence is still as raw and visceral as it was when it was released in 1993. In terms of pure enjoyment in the form of fast paced action, this game delivers in spades. It is what every shooter today pretends not to be as they try to disguise themselves under thinly veiled attempts at plot and character development, a no-brainer all out gore fest. It gives us what we want from a shooter with no unnecessary bells and whistles too often used in modern FPS games to cover up the fact that the game play is simply lacking behind the masquerade of fancy graphics and tedious cut-scenes that ultimately get in the way of the fun, I'm looking at you Call of Duty. I love intricate stories and fully developed characters in games, notable examples of these are the Mass Effect and Witcher series, but this is a genre that has never been about that. This is a genre where the only time you should get a break from the action is the loading screen between levels. Moreover, thanks to the dedicated and thriving fan base there are a plethora of mods and custom WAD files that are constantly breathing new life in to this game. 21 years later and there are still multiplayer servers active, that alone is pretty impressive.","August 29, 2015","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I was planning to install the Brutal Doom mod to it, anyway. So, I installed the source port, Zandronum, to my computer, then copied and pasted the .WAD files of Final Doom to the Zandronum folder, and then extracted the files of Brutal Doom to the Zandronum folder, and not only did Brutal Doom work on Final Doom, but Zandronum also made Final Doom much more playable, making it much easier to start up, getting rid of the lagging, fixing the doors, and adding way more options in the Options menu, including options for the controls, so now, I can actually have fun, playing Final Doom with or without Brutal Doom.

This game is composed of two parts: TNT and Plutonia. TNT: Evilution was the first part of a modified user creation that extended the DOOM story to DOOM guy now being the head officer of a space base who goes on a walk, when all of a sudden, demons show up and kill his entire crew, and he once again has to defeat the threat. The Plutonia Experiment is also a modified user creation adapted to have a story, where DOOM guy has to stop the government's quantum accelerated gate experiment that creates an opening to hell.\n\nGameplay: More of the same that is seen in previous doom titles. All weapons from the previous games like the super shotgun, plasma rifle, and BFG return. More dashing madness. More switches and surprise ambushes. 30 main levels for each. TNT: Evilution is the easier run. The Plutonia Experiment for some reason is really difficult. Good luck taking it out.\n\nSound: More whiny demons, same ol' blasts and explosions.\n\nGraphics: Zandronum source port was used. It holds up well.\n\nTechnical: No crashes or framerate issues encountered. Skybox glitches can occur in certain areas, but you'd really have to be snooping around.\n\nFinal Verdict: Buy this one on sale or with the bundle. It's not as good as DOOM II in my opinion, and seems almost masochistic on some levels. It's still worth a look if you like the series.\n\n","January 7","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
