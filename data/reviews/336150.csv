I already bought Virtual Pool 4 from Celeris web site last year (played more than 100 hours with it).  But their DRM scheme is simply painful.  You cannot installed the game on multiple computer (your desktop and your laptop for example) because you would need to re-activate the game each time  you play on different computer.  Simply painful.\n\nI bought the Steam version hoping to get rid of this DRM nonsense, only to find out that VP4 would only start if the Steam client is online, even if you play solo.  So I can't play on my laptop when I am away and no internet connection is available.  Celeris may have produced the best pool simulator, they just ruined it with annoying DRM issued.\n\nIn short, 10/10 for the best pool simulator, 0/10 to force users to be online all the time, even when playing solo.","May 12, 2015","true","0.4"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","35","41","2","0"

This is not an 'arcadey' pool game with tricks, flashing lights, etc. This game aims to be a simulation of real pool and nails it with great accuracy.\n\nThe store description already tells you a lot about the game, such as the plethora of game modes and whatnot, so I won't bother with that. What might not be clear that I feel should be mentioned is this:\n\nvery smooth gameplay\ntotally customizeable controls\nan active online community with multiplayer lobbies and moderators\nreal different pool tables of various sizes, constructions, and felts. Not merely cosmetic changes\nup to 2 vs 2 online multiplayer games and an infinite amount of spectators\nability to create lobbies (public or private) that are restricted to people of the skill level you choose\n\nI have played my share of pool games over the years, and this one is easily the best so far. I did enjoy Pool Nation, but now after playing this, I couldn't possibly go back. The claim by the developers that this game can improve your real game seems highly likely. I actually own a slate table myself, so I will be putting that claim to the test...if I can stop playing it on the computer long enough. :-)","May 29, 2015","true","47.1"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","25","30","2","5"

The game has the "feel" of real pool. You can make shots without the need of a lined up aid aimer. I own Pool Nation, I played 68 hours on it, VP4 is 10 times more realistic. Pool Nation wins with higher res graphics, but VP4 has decent graphics, gameplay trumps graphics in this case for me.\n\nI have no problem finding real players in VP4's awesome lobby system, I can't describe how awesome the lobby is.... You walk into a room and if 2 people are playing, you play the winner. There were 50 people logged in to the lobby playing at all times in the 2 days I have owned this game.\n\nTons of camera options, you can view the shot in almost any zoomed in view to make the "feel" match your own style of real play.\n\nPool Nation on sale for 2 bucks is a steal, but VP4 is by far the better game for people who play/played real pool. I am giving it a 9 out of 10, I would love to see PN's high res graphics in this game, but it appears the pc specs will allow many more people to play VP4.

Yes its a game,but it goes far deeper than that when you break it down into its constituents.\nIf you like simply to bang a few balls around against an AI player from time to time and set the game level to your specific choosing you can do so.\n\nIf however you want to develop and learn about billiards and pool in general then it also can cater to your needs.\n\nFrom the Video totorials by Steve Daiking you can learn the very basics in the art and skill Of Pool to the more advanced positioning and cue ball control and once you think you have mastered that phase you may want to start a hustler career and gamble your bux against the Poolsharks at the various and sometimes seedy locations  available to you.\n\nYou also have a varied and comprehensive  career mode at your disposal.Start of as a lowly amateur and see if you can progress your way through the ranks to take on what seems to be a brutal Champion level in the game.\n\nYou have a trick shot mode,you can set a table and the balls the way you want and try perhaps to recreate a shot you seen one of your heroes play in the past.\n\nIn short there is a whole host of things to keep yourself interested in the game,above all though this is not simply a game,its a learning tool that anyone who has a mind to can progress and advance their own understanding of how to shoot a ball and  and makes runs and start winning.\n\nVirtual Pool does all this with the best control,method of all,the mouse.\nYour mouse controls your cue stick,you draw the mouse back and push it forward to take a shot,it could not be simpler.\n\nUsing the mouse is the simplest and best way to give you the weight and feel of a shot and its also through time has proved Celeris have got it right since way back in 1995 when Virtual Pool first saw the light of day.\n\nOther games of this nature have always used power bars and meters that take so much longer for you to set a shot up and actually hit a ball.Virtual Pool does not mess about and very quickly you will see that they got it right.\n\nIt can improve your reallife game but only if you want it to as its down to what level you want or think you may be able to acheive,the sky is the limit as far as that goes.\n\nOk some will say the graphics although a vast improvement on the fore runners in the series, they dont jump out at you like some other nicer looking games of that ilk.You may be right and there is still room for improvement as the game will be a work in progress and is being improved all the time.\n\nWhat  stands out by a country mile is the game play and once you have mastered all the key controls as that will take time I think you will find that Virtual Pool 4 has got all the rest beat in comparison\nIts not simply a game its as true a simulation as you can possibly get on PC and for the time being still hold onto the title of Best Pool and Billiard sim of all.\n\nIf you are new to this type of game please dont judge it after a few hours of struggling around and feeling your not getting anywhere.Use the tracking lines as a help if you need to,use the ghost ball to show you where to hit the ball.\n\nThe most important thing is to give it time and if you want to learn and progress,you will and it will grow on you all the more.You will keep coming back to it and you will develop as a player and you also will get a better understanding of the art of billiards and Pool in General.\n\nYou have tried the rest....now try the best. Virtual Pool 4 Its what sitting up to 4 am in the morning is all about.","June 11, 2015","true","062.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","1"

It has its problems, and they are being fixed albeit slowly.\n\nPros -\n\n+ Almost completely realistic ball physics. Any shot you can play on a real table you can play here, apart from a few (See cons)\n\n+ Most variations of popular cuesports available.\n\n+ Nice online community - most players are GOOD :P\n\n+ Will definitely help your real game, especially by watching other people play.\n\n+ Addictive once you get the feel for the mouse stroke\n\n+ SO MUCH FUN when you're in a tourney with good people.\n\nCons -\n\n- Some things aren't modelled correctly. Snooker pockets are wrong. Cushion compression on the pockets isn't modelled so you can't play hard shots (a staple of snooker) into the back of the pocket... you have to hit the drop perfectly. It also means in 9ball if you get stuck straight on a ball frozen to the rail you can't do the trick of shooting cushion first. Throw is modelled (slow thin cuts with draw push off line) but it is exaggerated and unrealistic... will frustrate some players.\n\n- Slow update process. It's a one man team as far as I'm aware. Hire somebody!\n\n- Online community for the most part are nice but you will be destroyed until you know what you're doing... I've been playing this game for about 7 years but for a newbie they might get frustrated. People pull no punches.\n\n- Graphics aren't the best, but very serviceable.\n\n- Currently community is too small - steam realease has helped this and it's getting bigger all the time!\n\n- The game is NOT CLEAR that multiplayer is more or less $10 a year... I don't mind and this is nothing when you consider that if you like cuesports you will be playing this game for life, but it is not well advertised at all.\n\nIf you like pool or snooker, you can't go wrong.

It simulates in a perfect manner the real cue games and offers a true and immersive experience for any gamer out there.\n\nStory time...once upon a time I was very excited about playing snooker for real. But having some limited financial possibilities and a snooker table being a must for top performance, I started to play Virtual Pool, hoping that it will improve my average game. Soon I was going to be the first junior champion of my country, by only playing a computer game. Sounds silly but it's absolutely true. Years later when I became the owner of a real snooker table and after winning the senior national championship, I still play Virtual Pool for fun. Transposing from the snooker table to the computer game comes natural.\n\nThe angles are all the same. The effects and cue action are a little more pronounced in the game, as we are dealing with 1s and 0s here, and not real physics. Also, impossible shots can be achieved in the game, while in real life the table's architectural design will reject some of the object balls. Very, very few flaws, that naturally come from the limited possibilities of today's gaming engines and design tools. Except for the technique - not needing to keep a stable position with firm hand bridge and feet in the right angles, head straight with chin touching the cue; no feather movement back and forth, no movement of the eyes between the cue ball, object ball and pocket - this game simulates the real deal frighteningly accurate. It's sick and I can assure you that what they say is absolutely true: It really makes your real game better!\n\nI would like to thank Celeris developers (I always do when I have the chance) for bringing to the public this masterpiece. And of course, many thanks to Steam for making this game available. I waited a long time for it and I would of bought it eventually from the original website, but Steam is better.\n\nEnjoy your 147 potting zone! :D","August 24, 2015","true","349.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It really can improve your actual game in real life, although the AI skill 'rubber-banding' gets quite noticeable when you are good.

I opted for this version to get auto updates.\n\nThe original Virtual Pool (1995) game still holds up today, and is very similar physics wise to its newer iterations, VP3 and VP4.\n\n\nNeeds improvement/some suggestions for the developer;\n\n1. Menus feel quite clunky and dated. To get back to the main menu you have to hit the word "Cancel". I dont know how many times i hit OK and end up starting a new game. Just doesnt feel intuitive. (why not have a 'back to main' button on the left side of the screen?)\n\n2. Why cant I play snooker on a smaller table? VP3 allowed snooker to be played on a pub pool table. Its fun to do sometimes.\n\n3. Improved audio feedback. Theres nothing more satisfying than hearing an object ball "crack" the back of a pocket. This is missing on the snooker table no matter how hard I cue. Tables, pockets and rooms should sound different. It helps with ambience and immersion. Very important in a game like this. Sound shouldnt be overlooked.\n\n4. Backgrounds need some more work, I turn them off as they seem lazily tacked on at the end.\n\nThese are just some suggestions, for a game i still enjoy very much. Despite these, I still highly recommend.\n\n\n\n","September 17, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Stay away from this title folks, you'll be in the hospital faster than you can say *** THIS GAME.\n\nI've played all of the virtual pool series, and this one was a high disappointment.  Let's start with a few of the -good- points, and there are a few.\n\n1> Visually nice to watch, the textures and over all graphics are good.\n\n2> Physics are - decent.  And it pains me to say that because you can find spots where the physics are painfully obvious to be on vacation.  What would stop dead last shot, happens to roll JUST enough to **** you over next shot.\n\nThat's - about it.  Now for a shortened list of the bad points, points that aren't just me gnit picking.  Yes I only have 5 hours on the game, but it is very much enough to tell you what I've learned so far.\n\n1> One of the game's selling points is "Tracking so you can learn the mechanics of the ball."  Which it does do.  In practice.  Only.  The minute you load up one of the tours you can kiss the tracking lines goodbye, you won't be getting them at all.\n\n2> Another point is the ghost ball aiming assistant.  Which you do get. On tours, but it's a deception.  You line up perfectly only to have your ball miss the pocket and JUST happen to line up perfectly for your opponent.  Not all of the time mind you, sometimes it doesn't do this until you're on your last shot that would win you the game.\n\n3> The second ghost ball that is on the target ball to help you line up your shot.  Again this is very deceptive and not 100% accurate - more like 75%.  Maybe I'm not quite lining it up perfectly - but I'm playing on a 50" monitor so there's that.  It's not accurate.\n\n4> Poor controls and Deception in features.  So you spend a good 10-15 minutes going through the games tutorial.  the tutorial teaches you to use the F key to set the stroke power of your cue.  Remember the point about tracking lines?  This feature is GONE in anything other than practice, and the actually mouse controls of the cue is painful at best.  You line up your shot, you pull back on the cue, you push forward hard to break and the cue stops moving and doesn't hit the balls, in confusion you try again only for it to react way too early and your cue ball travels a pitiful inch across the table.  Bad controls = hard to play game.\n\n5> For those of you who have no idea what M. Bisoning is.  You will learn, oh yes you will learn.  You want to learn the game so you play the story on the easiest setting - which means NOTHING.   If the game decides you need more of a challenge.  The 10 year old girl who has been missing every shot suddenly becomes a crack shot and sinks everything, performing bank shots, jump shots and masse shots.  I - wish I was exagerating on this, It tries to issue a 'challenge' by having your computer opponents running with the equivilant of you using tracking lines - it's obvious if the computer decides the computer is going to win, the computer is going to win, going as far as obviouslly curving or increasing the speed of your last shot to have you scratch.\n\nFrom someone who's played all of the VP Series, I have to say I'm disappointed with this one, There's just no logic in what they expect you to accomplish.  It's clunky, it obviouslly ****s with your shots to emulate difficulty and the controls are lacking.

No support at Celeris except to blame your operating system.  All the forum tips don't work either although well intended.  If you want to  waste your time and  money go ahead.

My ♥♥♥.\n\nThis game's physics system is completely shot. Expect the cue ball to continuously bounce around like it has a mind of it's own even after you try to get that moving target of a shot power setting down. It gets to a point where it's; hit the ball, pocket the cue ball, get wrecked by the AI, hit the ball, pocket the cue ball. Seriously, the game would be enjoyable if it wasn't for the fact that the cue ball will bouce all over the place after a shot with no power. Really aggrivating experience and do not reccomend this game. Save your $25 on something else, something better.","March 17","false","26.5"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","1"
