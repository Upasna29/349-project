While they may have improved other parts of the game, the biggest part has remained largely unchanged.\n\nThe things it does right are the visual effects and the sound. Definitely feels like an old kung fu movie by looking at it. Luckily you can toggle each of the options if you don't like them.\n\nBiggest thing it does wrong? The actual gameplay.\nThe combat is horrible, just so stiff and clunky. Kung fu should be smooth and fluid, graceful almost. The game is not fun to play at all. If the clunky movements and animations were not enough sometimes the controls just don't work right.\n\nThere are other issues, like the characters not quite looking human, but the biggest part of a fighting game (the fighting) is what ruins this game.\n\nI love Kung fu movies and to this day have lots of fun watching old ones I've never heard of. I know it's not popular anymore so it's even more rare for a game like this to exist. Sadly this was so disappointing I wish I never had bought it.","June 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 147 of 184 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","147","184","10","2"

I thought they were making great progress and it would be in early access for massive polish and basic development for much much longer than it has been. I was expecting the game to have full online multiplayer and matchmaking as well as a huge boost in animation and graphical quality of the game. For the most part they have just added characters and changed minor things here or there.\n\nNot to mention the developer promised online MP before realizing that he could not deliver, or possibly knowing he couldnt deliver and promising it anyways just to get sales. Thats awful. Thats really awful.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are kind of limiting. combos are EXTREMELY hard WAY harder than even usf4 because they feel like all 1f links. The characters are clunky. This game needed a parry system. Desperately. It never got one. Footsies feel dull, moves are easily abused, and jumping attacks rarely work. Its just not a good fighting game. Not to mention the combo cap at 7... smh\n\nGood:\nAlternative to other fighting games\ndecent optimization\nfun characters to mash\n\nBad:\nPoor Graphics\nUgly menus\nBroken characters/moves\nNo online multiplayer or matchmaking\nNo parry system\nBoring footsies\nAbusable moves/characters\n\n2/10 because its cheap.","June 25, 2015","false","5.0"," 101 of 133 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","101","133","4","1"

Also my game never played as smooth as showing in the trailers. Story too is non existant..\n\nThe positive touch is naturally the homage to all the old fighting movies and their characters. The fighters have their different move sets (which isnt easy to execute, especially the combos) and each resemble some of the heroes of the cheesy martial arts flicks. From Bloodsport, to white hosed Chuck to the Cast of Enter the Dragon and so on.\n\nAll in all this game is just like the old movies... cheap, cheesy and shouldn´t be measured by todays standards, but you can have some fun out of it, if you´re a fan.","April 20, 2015","true","3.6"," 64 of 91 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","64","91","3","5"

Bloodsport, Enter the Dragon, The Last Dragon for those that want to mix Kung Fu and break dancing.. which heck if you were alive during the 80's those were the two things which you loved...\n\nThis game much like the 80's  an acquired taste.. it has some great classic characters....  an amazing sound track and the old grainy look will leave you busting out your breakdancing gear unfortunately the game play seems stuck in 80's right along with all these classic characters.\n\nThe game isn't fluid at all, the trailers are downright misleading.  You'll never play the game as fluid and smooth as the trailers show.  The controls are stiff and slightly unresponsive..  The Hit detection seems to be at best flawed, sometimes you'll see your foot fly through someone face with no dmg... other times you'll hit thin air and see someone fly to the ground like a sack of bricks..  Also the AI is weak, you can win by using the same move or combo of moves over and over again..  Cheese factor is high in this one...\n\nIf you want a good compaison think of the Original Mortal Kombat, this game's combat and character stiffness seems nearly identical if not slightly worse..  although button responsiveness MK has a massive leg up.   I won't say the game can't improve, but seeing as the Development team removed the Early Access and the last update aside from adding cards to the game was done about 3 months ago I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet the game won't be improved any longer.\n\nThis just isn't a game I can recommend with a 9.99 price tag, if you can are a huge 80's kung fu flick type of guy.. it might be worth it just for some kicks and giggles, if you're a fighting game fan, you have far better choices for far cheaper prices..","October 3, 2015","false","3.8"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","1"

First of all i wanna congratulate the small developing team for bringing such a game to life. Its really nice to know that there are so many passionate indie game developers that can offer so much for so little. Kings of Kung Fu is an original fighting game, based on old kung fu movies and the game itself couldnt be a more sheer tribute to those films. Now on to the game itself.\n\nThe good stuff:\n1. Amazing nostalgia feelings for the old Kung fu movie era\n2. One of the greatest soundtracks i have ever heard, homage to those old movies style\n3. Full and interesting and everexpanding roster of characters based on real fighters (Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris!!!)\n4. Great level design and amazing details to make you feel like you are a part of a kung fu movie.\n5. Nice and easy gameplay, but hard to master.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n1. Controls are not as responsive as they should be.\n2. Combos are hard to master\n3. Combat still has some bugs that need to be wiped out (you can win a whole round just by doing low right kick ^^)\n4. Graphics are really nice and polished, but for this day and age not the top quality i would like.\n5. No online multiplayer\n\nTo conclude, for me Kings of Kung fu is a really good game. It has some flaws, but considering the effort it has been made by a rather small team, i would say this is something most of us can pass through. For the most part its a really enjoyable game and you will have tons of fun playing either by yourself or with some of your m8s locally. At the moment there is no online multiplayer, so i know for a lot of you thats a turn off, but still it could happen in the future. If you like old Kung Fu movies and if you ever wanna see what it Feels like to be Bruce Lee facing Chuck Norris once more, buy this little gem ^^","June 25, 2015","true","3.4"," 51 of 75 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","51","75","4","0"

If yes, then this game is for you. Maybe it does not shine graphics and today a very short history, but the atmosphere and the movement of characters is superb. Playing I did have the thought that I play for Bruce Lee. Here not only the movement, but also the nuances of each character. Inimitable atmosphere of the game. The picture is similar to the films of 70-80 years. Sounds just perfect. Whether it's hitting, or background music, which corresponds to a fighter. This game is a great fighting game for those who love these movies. I hope the developers will add more characters and make the story longer. But even now the game is good, though of course there is some imbalance between the characters And here it is possible again and again to arrange a fight between Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan.","December 8, 2014","true","3.3"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","40","56","0","0"

But also being somewhat familiar with fighting games, I find playing it a chore.\n\nThe jumping is unmanagable and forget about pulling off any air atacks.  Blocking also feels flakey and slow to get out of, leaving charcters backed into a corner by continuous attack strings.  I'm down for a more methodical, slower fighter, but I have to feel like I can control the character to enjoy it.\n\nThough there are some awesome moments here:  the feeling of weight and impact of strikes, how characters slap-block incoming attacks, also sound effects are pretty good. Also great golden harvest-esque into and shaw brothers style logo.\n\nAlthough unfortunately I can't recommend the game in this state.

Although, talking about how graphically good it is, not so much, but I'm not complaining for what it's worth.\n\nGoing to gameplay, the fighting feels solid with every hit I send or receive 'feeling' the impact of the punch/kick, not as powerful of a 'feel' as Dead or Alive, but it's there and it's good, and comparing it to a triple-A game says something. The controls are decent, with me going with a controller rather than using a mouse and keyboard, but checking some of the move lists to, trying to preform some of the fighters more complex combos, I found out that I simply could not preform it, and If I'm doing it wrong then I would at least like to have a notification in the practice mode telling me so, or maybe a good tutorial on the move list would be nice.\n\nI'd recommended this game for being a solid fighting game, and a interactable blast from the past for those who crave it. It's not a great fighting game, or a great looker, but it is a good fighter and a looker, and a great game for it's low price.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","December 21, 2014","true","0.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

Sad to say that this remains a thumbs-down and I'm afraid it'll stay like that. Bummer.\n\nOriginal Review\nDefinitely has something going for it. Though graphics aren't state-of-the-art, I very much like the overall style the game tries to get across. Film grain, flickering, filmstrip frames, fitting background music and all the great characters[www.kingsofkungfu.com] from martial arts cinema (though no real names), each with their own fighting style. There's not much bells and whistles gameplay-wise and I like that simplicity. Directional controls and only left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick; that's it.\n\nThe user interface also looks dated but works, so I don't really care much.\n\nWhat keeps me from giving this the thumbs-up is the overall gameplay itself: Controls are really bad (at least with a Xbox 360 controller, didn't bother playing with a keyboard) and oftentimes your character ends up doing things you didn't expect, e.g. dashing back or jumping instead of doing a ↓+←. Some combos often do not register or you need very weird timing to execute them and some simply do not work. Also, grabbing your opponent only works if you stand still. Why?\n\nIn addition, hitboxes and hit registration are really bad and need work. I understand that Ron Jones is huge and has long legs and what not. But receiving a kick in your face whilst there's at least a 1 m gap between foot and face isn't funny.\n\nSo in summary, I really want this to be good, it already provides some fun and has great style but the gameplay and controls are imho badly broken. For a fighting game this is fundamental. I hope this gets fixed.\n\nIf you don't care about the technical issues, get it while it's on sale.

Surugi's magic slide and dishonorable shuriken game couldn't step to my cossack plays and I before I knew it I was face to face with the Red Ronin himself.\nMost men fear the Ronin. He is a warlock, a wizard, a sensual lover and a master of every forbidden technique in both Kung Fu and Life. We fell a little bit in love there, fighting, me kicking him in the shins and adjusting my fro as he doubled over after another world-shaking KA-POW! to the gronch. But it couldn't last. He started it. I ended it.\n\nI write to you know, dear Steam, from my throne at the top of the Kung Fu. It's a lonely station, but I brought this upon myself. Numbers can not contain this game, I can not give it a score. Play it only if you too can climb over the bodies of the fallen to attain mysterious powers.","April 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","65","15","23","22","0"

Go!" Not very compelling. Games like Soul Caliber and Street Fighter at least give you more than that~~~!\n\n- Character models: They almost all look like Jackie Chan during a battle. They have very nice pictures in the selection screen, but almost all of them look like Jackie Chan in some form or another, with an oddly proportioned face/head.\n\n- Mechanics: I couldn't get any of the moves to work, on the move list. At all. I was using an Xbox controller, so maybe it's just the support for controllers that is faulty, I'm not sure.\n\n- VOLUME: No way of changing the volume until the game starts up, which is awful for this game, considering it blasts the music and such as soon as you start it up. It's REALLY VERY LOUD, and actually scared me, although I was prepared for the game turning on.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Details: Detailed enough that everything looks pretty good, considering.\n\n- Straight forward: Though lacking a story, which is nice to have, the fighting is fairly consistent (regardless of the move list moves not working, in my case)\n\n- Typical: Feels like a typical fighting game, although a little bit on the lean side.\n\n\n======\n\nWould I recommend "Kings of Kung Fu"?\nNo, sadly, I can't... yet.\n\nIf you get gifted it, it's good for a quick go.\nIf it's on sale for next to nothing (as it was when I purchased it), I can't say it would be a total waste, because it's not terrible.\n\nBut it's definitely not something to write home about, as of yet.\n\nIf they improve the issues, polish it up a bit more, and fine-tune it before final release, then my rating may change :) There's something here, and it's definitely salvageable~","May 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The concept is cool and unique, and is the reason I bought it.\n\nBut the execution of this game falls way short.\n\n1.) The A.I. is horribly broken.  On the hardest difficulty, the computer spams moves from full screen, and rarely ever blocks.  If you can knock them down, which is fairly easy, you can attack them as they wake up, and knock them back down.  Repeat forever and win.  With no online multiplayer, this is the only way to play the game aside from local co-op, and it makes the game not fun whatsoever.\n\n2.) Controls are laggy and unresponsive.  Fighting games thrive on good execution and balance to do well, and unfortunately this game doesn't live up.  There is a parry system, but it is difficult to pull of because of input lag.  If you perform a combo, it takes several seconds to show up on the screen.\n\n3.) I am worried about copywrite infrigement.  Not the characters themselves, as they (I believe) fall under parody law, but the blatant rip of voices from movies starring said actors.  This isn't so much of a complaint, but just a general worry.\n\nI hope this game receives some updates that fixes the glaring problems that it has.  I absolutely LOVE the concept, being a fan of kung fu movies, but this game is a broken unenjoyable mess.  I also understand that this was made by  an indy company with a limited budget, and a failed kickstarter, but that is no excuse to put out a broken game.\n\n","July 3, 2015","false","1.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Controls are bad, clumsy and sometimes unresponsive (this makes it even harder to create combo attacks), collision detection is also bad. Also, sometimes you are not sure wether graphics is bad or is it intentional like that. And there is no story mode (this game really deserves it) All of this really ruins gameplay and could be a major reason not to play this game.\n\nBut everything else is great, or should I say original - familiar and memorable fighters (Bruce Lee, Donnie Yen, Chuck Norris, Bolo Yeung, JCVD...) and stages from 70's (and later) kung fu movies really brings memories. Personally, visual and music are really likeable and appropriate for this kind of game.\n\nIn my opinion, this game really needs a lot to polishing.\nFor fighting games, good and poslihed controls are a must.

This is a review that recounts my personal experience, my initial impression, and ultimately, whether or not it felt like the price was worth the value and content I received. If you agree with my thoughts, you should definitely get it. If you don't, maybe wait for an update that brings in what you want or keep looking for that perfect fighting game!\n\nIncredibly entertaining game. In a marketplace where fighting games with flashy supers and comeback mechanics oversaturate the market, this bare basic Kung Fu arcade fighter brings an oddly refreshing aftertaste. There are no fancy mechanics. In return, you get a game that is about raw skill.\n\nThis game initially felt very slow and heavy. I guarantee everyone will experience the same feeling. The perfect way to describe the pace is exactly like how its advertised on the store page. It's designed to remind you of fight scenes you'd typically witness in movies. Everything starts very slow, but once you get a tempo, it becomes very fast. After all the punches and kicks fly around everywhere, it starts to settle down. Because of the post-defeat slow mo, it feels gratifying when you land that hit that knocks out your opponent! It's exactly how a movie would go. That last final hit when the hero defeats the villain is slowed down immensely so all can savor the moment, the impact, the realization.\n\nBecause this is a 4 button fighter (no light, medium or hard attacks/just left punch/kick and right punch/kick), combo strings are longer to compensate. However, even if you drop it, it feels satisfying knowing there's a high chance you will be able to master it.\n\nSome modes I really wanted after playing a few hours are in highest to lowest expectations 1) tournament mode 2) challenges 3) trials\n\nOnline, more characters, more combos, and constant dev communication and support are already essentially guaranteed so there is no reason to put those on the wishlist.\n\nNow I'm off to play some more!","December 8, 2014","true","10.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I share the same thoughts that the previous reviewers say that it's a refreshing piece of work that gets back to basics to what a true fighting game is all about. The moments within the games does closely match the original actors in the original Kung Fu movies. I've been an avid player of Street Fighter all the way back to version 2 which still is one of my favorites just because it was simple and that your victories relies purely on skill with no fancy power ups. The atmospheric feeling of a old school film like effect that you have used within in the game feels both eerie and connecting at the same time especially with some of the actors who have passed away. The effect really does feel like you are actually playing in real Kung Fu movie with all its cheesiness and unique fighting styles which I feel has been lost over the years. The design team has really paid homage to the original movie franchise, unpolluted from other big gaming companies.\n\nI know there are a couple of bugs that needs to be looked after which is expected, but my experience so far with it has been a positive one having no crashes. Like the other reviewers has mentioned it seems to be a too easy to beat the computer which I guess will be adjusted for the final release. As far as the actors go, everyone looks alight except for Blood Sport guy whose face and hair looks a bit weird. Other than that everything looks great. As for suggested characters, maybe your team can look into the characters of one of the most popular Kung movies of all time which is the 5 Deadly Venoms.

Thanks to Steam's new refund feature, I should be able to get my money back, and I hope I do.\n\nThe controls in this game are simply unbearable. Combos are impossible to complete, not to mention just moving your character in the direction you want can seem impossible sometimes. The menus (although with great music) are unbearable to look at including the players move lists especially and the control menu. There's no tutorial so don't expect to be shown how to make this rocket-science-esque control scheme work. All in all, this game easily had the potential to be an awesome little arcade game that would be fun to play with friends who also enjoy arcade fighters such as MK, Tekken, SF, and others.

My console and PC library is littered with fighting games of all stripes - from NES to PS3 to Saturn and NEO-GEO CD. Most follow the traditional Capcom/SNK mold, with the occasional indy game. I stumbled on Kings of Kung Fu by accident and figured I'd spend some cash on an indy fighter to give it a chance - I was not disappointed.\n\nKings of Kung Fu is climbing the charts as a favorite game of mine. It's not as smooth as it could be or polished. However, what it lacks in completeness, it makes up in atmosphere and character. The filter the game uses makes the game look like classic martial arts cinema. The cast is made up of homages to the heroes of the genre, with more on the way.\n\nWhen a developer pours in as much love as they can into a game, you can feel it. Kings of Kung Fu is one of those games; it has an intangible it that will draw in a core audience. The looks, character designs, soundtrack... those are the strengths. While not the smoothest game, and kind of clunky, something compels me to keep playing.\n\nIf you enjoy old kung-fu flicks, buy this game and have a blast - more goodness should be on the way from these guys soon.","December 27, 2014","true","3.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

My follow-up review is finally ready:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ule27Oq-B2M\n\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHello viewers!  Welcome to a special episode of A Bird's Eye View.  My name is Endeavor, and today we are revisiting Kings of Kung Fu.  It's been six months since I first reviewed this game, and now that it's out of Early Access, let's see how it holds up.\n\nThe story mode in Kings of Kung Fu remains largely unchanged.  The player takes control of a stunt-person looking to become an action star.  A man named Red Ronin organizes a tournament that offers the winner that very opportunity.  All you have to do is defeat the other fighters.\n\nThe playable characters are all obvious parallels to real-life actors from martial arts movies.  The roster has expanded to include fourteen characters.  Both the 2.0 and 3.0 patches added characters to the roster for free.  This bodes well for future updates considering that the New Fighter Request post in the forums is the most active thread in the community.  The diversity of the playable characters remains a strong feature, although the options for playable female characters is still fairly limited.\n\nIf one was to make a list of this games best features, the atmosphere would clearly be at the top.  The stages are homages to iconic scenes and sets from various martial arts movies.  The bright and bold colors combine with music that ranges from funk to traditional to bring the player back to the golden age of kung fu flicks.  Everything is cheesy and over-the-top, and this game revels in it.\n\nGameplay may be a sticking point for people used to triple-A fighters.  There are four attack buttons, and every character has a list of combos that can be strung together.  Hit-detection isn't always spot-on, and it can take some time to really get a feel for controlling your character.  Since the days of Early Access, there have been numerous fixes and tweaks to the gameplay.  Jumping attacks are much smoother now than they were in December, but they do still feel a little cumbersome.\n\nController support is included, but be warned that the controls were made with a D-pad in mind.  Players used to controllers with a joystick will have difficulties consistently doing quarter-circle attacks.  There was mention of a fix for this somewhere in the future, but this update is probably a ways off.\n\nOne major complaint that users have with Kings of Kung Fu is the lack of online multiplayer.  This feature was talked about during Early Access.  At some point in time, Jae Lee Productions realized they would not be able to deliver, and all plans to include it in the final product were scrapped.  They have since apologized and pledged to work harder than ever on adding more characters and stages.\n\nOne point I made in my last video praising Jae Lee Productions on their commitment to user feedback still stands.  Even after beta testing and months of Early Access, they are just as active as ever with their community.  The new fighters they've added for free were picked largely from suggestions by the players, and gameplay fixes are uploaded regularly.\n\nKings of Kung Fu officially released on June 25th.  After six months, I feel that I can still recommend this game.  Despite its rough edges, there is a genuinely enjoyable product here that shows a lot of heart and commitment.  The retail price is $9.99, although the game frequently goes on sale.  It's available on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\nThat concludes my follow-up review for Kings of Kung Fu.  I'd like to congratulate Jae Lee Productions for getting their game through Early Access.  And, of course, thank you for watching.  Don't forget to follow us on Twitter at Rookery Gamers for let's plays and additional reviews.","July 2, 2015","true","10.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

I didnt lose any fights so it seemed rather easy. the end boss was a lil hard and i barely beat him both rounds with a sliver of health left over. I think i was on the easiest difficulty after checking so im sure it can be more challenging.\n-Devs, Id suggest doing a regular traditional difficulty setting rather than a slider.\n\nThe game captures that old Kung Fu vibe for sure. from the character design and clothing to the levels and backdrops and the soundtrack is all on point really good! it has the flicker of the screen effect or film grain im not sure what to call it maybe its a combination of both but it feels and looks like an old movie. It does have a bit of jankiness to the movements and animations, im not saying that as a negative either. im pretty sure thats intentional for the old kung fu movie theme.\n\nControls seem pretty  good, no analong sticks, its all D-Pad movements but i like it that way so no complaints for me. I did have a hard time doing some of the moves but that could be my fault moreso than the game. Im using a xbox  360 controller and they arent known for the best D-pads.\n\nof course its early access game so there is plenty of things that could use some polish to them but for an early access game on initial release id say this is quite well done atm with plejty of room to grow.\n\nOnline MP isnt working atm but local mp is.\n\nAt such a low price and considering the content here right now on first day of EA release.....its a great deal and sure to only get better with more work being done.","December 8, 2014","true","1.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

But ANYone who loves Kung Fu movies will understand this game is paying deep repsect and homage to the long lost days of low-budget Hollywood martial arts. And for that, all is forgiven. Hell, just having four generations of martial arts masters (Sho'Nuff AND Chuck Norris AND Donny Yen AND maybe somebody who kind of looks like Jet Li)  in the same game is cause for celebration by most contemporary Kung Fu fans.\n\nThere IS a way to create a game that honors the legacy of cheaply made kung-fu movies, but because of controls and murky animation, this game somewhat misses the mark... but it's VERY much on the right path to kung fu grindhouse greatness. I do hope the developer continues to update it, smooth out some of that animation and sharpen the fighting controls.

There was some mention of it being like a platforming game and too much jumping. Well before I bought this game I did look at some u-tube videos of it and I could see no evidence of that. On the contrary, when playing this game it has less jumping than most other martial arts fighting games that I have played. The ususal cheap trick is to somersault in kick punch and back out. That doesn't work here. In Kings of Kung Fu there is a lot of side to side punching it out and blocking more like the movies it's based on. It thus plays a lot better. The other great thing about this game was how close the contests can be, right down to the wire. Makes for some nerve racking fights. First time in on normal difficulty level and using a keyboard I won my first 2 fights (second one very close) and the third against a monk, kicked his butt in first round and then he won the next 2 in very close shaves. It was pure fun and a pleasure to play. I will definitely be going back for more. A great game and it's not even finished yet! I highly recommend this game if you like fighting games. If you love kung-fu then don't even think twice, just buy it. It plays superbly.\n\nEdit: Now that I've played it more, there is a bit of jumping but that seems more if you put it on easy level - the AI is jumping all over the place.\n\nJust some pros and cons that I've found but they will be cleaned up no doubt when finished:\n\nCons\n\nMenu system is bad, first use mouse then use keyboard. Doesn't seem to know what it's doing. A bit frustrating. The menu system of Skyrim when first released springs to mind.\n\nSome characters seem a bit overpowered compared to the others - Bruce Lee in particular.\n\nNo multiplayer mode yet.\n\nAt the moment same game every time you play. Same characters in certain orders mostly.\n\nBoring repetitive music. But you can turn it off.\n\nThe AI doesn't seem any differnet between easy and normal except that on easy mode the AI jumps all over the place making the game a ridiculous mess and making it no easier then the normal level. I'd stick to normal level if I were you.\n\nPros:\n\nSuperb animations.\n\nSuperb sounds of the fighters.\n\nHealth system drains very slowly making for some really long kung -fu film style fights.\n\nExcellent graphics overall.\n\nExcellent different styles of each fighter. Each very different.\n\nThe price of £5 at the moment is a bargain for what you get.","February 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Overall it's a lot of fun, and more than worth the introductory price. I also think it's worth the full price.\n\nI do have a few minor complaints. I noticed a few odd collision detections. Most of the time it's pretty good, but there were a few times that I got hit, where it looked like the opponent didn't quite connect. This was pretty minor, and didn't occur all the time.\n\nThe game has a Tekken-ish 2 kick buttons 2 punch buttons approach. It relies on the Street Fighter press backward to block mechanic. It would be nice if they utilized the shoulder buttons for counters and blocks or something along those lines.\n\nThey could use more levels, player characters, and maybe a few more moves per character.\n\nThe audio is fun, but could be rebalanced/remastered a bit. It sounds a bit low-pass-filtered, and the characters are kind of quiet. (I didn't look for audio options during my first play though.)\n\nOtherwise, it's a lot of fun. The characters all fight in the prevalent (or at least most famous) styles that they're modeled after. For example the Jackie Chan-alike fights in drunken style. The Yuen Biao-alike fights in monkey style, the Bruce Lee-alike obviously chinese boxing/jeet kun do. etc. etc.\n\nOverall, I recommend it for people that are into Kung-Fu movies. It could just use a bit of polishing and tightening up.

Bear in mind this Early access!!\n\nPros.\n\n- The art style really is spot on and captures the mood.\n\n- The referrences to all the classic martial artists. Bruce Lee etc etc\n\n- The sound track. I found myself enjoying the beat as I received a beating.\n\n- The move lists. Nothing mega complicated to pull off and all very real and authentic looking when you do a move.\n\n- The stages look good and fit the theme. No silly giant dinosaurs or fields with sheep. (looking at you SF and Tekken)\n\n- The combat. It feels weighted and at a realistic pace. Sure, you can jump quite high, but it feels right. I also found myself picking and choosing when to strike and thinking about the right move to use at the time. An example is using John Deux against another fighter that jumped in on me a lot, I'd patiently wait to use forward and right kick as an anti air tool.\n\n- Each of the 8 fighters at present feel different as opposed to other games with copy/paste and reskinned fighters.\n\n- The PRICE. Even at normal price this game is a steal.\n\n- The devs. They are on the forums and answering to everyone. Obviously this makes sense to do so with a new game, but i've known other devs to be very tight lipped and distant with their community.\n\n- The fact that us gamers can climb onboard with this from day one. Other well known fighters are harder to break into because you're up against people with years of experience. This is fresh and new and realy does feel like it.\n....................................................................................................................................................................................\nCons.\n\n- Some tweaking could be done to how fluid the inputs register. Sometimes I felt a small delay on some moves. JD's down, down, right kick for example. Grabs felt a little off to me also.\n\n- At present the controller options are a 360 pad or a keyboard, but the devs have stated they are on top of this and more controller support is incoming. Right of the bat I wanted to get my fight stick in action.\n\n- No online multiplayer at present, but again the devs are working towards this and are very open with the commuinty.\n\n- Perhaps a very small in game tutorial could be implemented to give people a better understanding of how the mechanics of the game work, such as distance, when to counter etc etc I feel some people may not 'Get it' straight away. Even something text/pictorial based would do.\n\n","December 9, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The characters and settings are based on old kung fu/martial arts movies, and all of the fighters fast-paced movements are the type that you'd see in those old movies as well. The developer made it seem even more like watching an old kung fu movie by kinda making the fights look your watching them on an old television with rounded off corners. The controls seem fairly responsive and the game is played like any other standard 2D fighter. The game has 3 difficulty levels, and 8 playable charachters, with the possiblility of more being added in the future as the game is still in "early access".  The game is also reasonably priced.

For the price and the game being early access I think it is amazing.  There is something about it that made me fall in love with the original mortal kombat.  Maybe its the realistic graphics and gameplay, but in some ways I enjoyed playing this game more than Tekken Street Fighter X etc.  This game feels more like a labour of love rather than something that has been produced from a high-powered games factory.  There is still a lot of work for the developers to do but what they have done so far has great potential.  If you love fighting games and want to support fighting games for the pc, for this price you must buy this game.\n\nThe fighters have a great variety of moves but I would still like the moves to be excuted a bit smoother as somethings they seem sudden like a tacky 2D fighting game.  But overall the variety of moves and their execution is good.  The graphics are cool.  The game is easy to play.  The sounds effects and overall theme are cool.

While I do find the game's character models to be very dated in appearance I'm by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ and only care about gameplay.  I do really love the film grain and style of the game. As for the core game, it plays much better than I expected. Combos are easy to pull off and look very brutal. What I do have issue with is that the controller scheme doesn't allow use of analog sticks or to change button setup (they are backwards to me). Using the D-pad is an issue FOR ME, but maybe not for others. I found that trying to pull of moves with the D-pad was a hit or miss task for me most times. Luckily I own Xpadder and just mapped my own controller scheme, but hope that this will all be supported in game soon. The computer opponent A.I. is competent as any other fighting game when turned up a few extra difficulty levels. Characters are all recognizable to any martial arts film buff as are the stages they fight on. In a nutshell, for the price tag this game is very original and FUN and can only be better with friends. This is just an ALPHA. I can only imagine the content and features that this game will gain in the upcoming development period. Not perfect by any means, but so far so good in my opinion.  Especially considering this is a game that's been in development for less than a year using Unity3D.","December 8, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I then downloaded and and tried to play it.  Thats where I turned it off after several matches.  My main issue were the controls (using an Xbox 360 control pad), they were so bad its difficult to explain.  I put this down to it being early access so uninstalled it and hve only just re-installed it but the controls are exactly the same using both a Steam Controller, an Xbox 360 and Xbox 1 controller.  I thought that this at least would have been resolved but was disappointed that it was the same, this is no only in-game but also i n the menus,  using the left stick I moved down to goto options and it jumped right past and sat on exit.  Maybe this was what I should have done.  Then after setting up the game with the very few options I played again.  The characters are not very fluent when moving, the overall finish on the game is very poor and I do understand they were going for an aged look to the game.\n\nNormally I won't write a review unless I have played at least 2 hours of a game, by then I will have a feel for the game and eventhough I won't have done much I will know what to expect.  This game is the exception, it is beyond poor and yet I still think that if more effort had been put into it or a more experienced dev had ran with this it would have been a very big hit.\n\nSorry but everyone needs to avoild this game at all costs.\n","May 30","false","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's almost as if they didn't age and transferred into a game. The game almost feels like a mixture of tekken, virtua fighter, mortal kombat and street fighter.

Almost. I have a minor grip with the frame timing for the animations but that is linked to the controls.\n\nThe sound is buggy. Some characters are clearly much louder than others, and the sound fx seem to fluctuate at times.\n\nOtherwise the classic look and feel of Kung Fu cinema is most certainly there. This i cannot fault the game on.\n\nNext, the controls...\n\nJust..AWFUL. Spongey, unreponsive, illogical at times.

Esspecially when you consider you can't after getting knocked over or retaliate from the ground.\n\n-The roster is small, but quite well rounded, and the stages are diverse enough to be satisfactory.\n\n-Hopefully the developers will attend to these issues, in particular the controls.\n\n-My verdict ultimately is, as much as i wanted this game to be great, it just simply falls far short at this stage.\n\n\nPS: A Tutorial feature would be nice.","March 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But I feel I have to write this on a playthrough of the single player. Here goes.\n\nThis is definitely fan-service material, and the stars are easily recognizable enough to make the dream fights we all talked about when we were younger come to fruition.\n\nOK, now for the gameplay.\n\nTOTALLY COMPETENT. Its somwhere between Dead or alive and Karateka. Easy to play, thoughtful, but crazy ♥♥♥ spike in understanding the flow of fight between characters. Mainly because I'm a TEKKEN/Soul Calibur fighter, I can totally understand the allure of this fighting game style, but becuase the fighting styles are so vastly different, the hit boxes dont allow for a back and forth sway to the battles.\n\n"what would you do to correct the game?"\n\nI would not change much, but here is my list:\n\n-Keep the blocking, but strikes and kicks could double as parries because meeting fist with fist would cancel the attacks, and counter the unbalances and disadvantages between the fighters. to keep it fair, add a parry meter that depletes as strikes connect, and blocking fills the meter.\n\n-I appreciate the ability to create your own combos, but it just needs to be looser. because of the vast style differences, once the parry system is in place, the styles of the characters can flourish, as opposed to being stuck waiting for an opening. this would keep everyone using ALL of the characters, because bthe would be attacking, either in defense or offense. the parry meter would slow the fights down if the parries are used too much, causing the fighters to back down to relenish the bars.\n\n- Street fighter 2 system in strikes. IE All Short atacks do the same damage, all Fierce attacks do the same damage. the net result would be faster characters would do primarily smaller damage, while stronger characters would do more.\n\n-Action Movie Star Competition? Man, this should have been "enter the dragon 2" or something. Its already the ultimate fantasy, so Lets revisit the seriousness of the combat and the reasons why these guys fight. I appreciate the humor, but I would love to take this more seriously. All of the settings are there. but being the "best" is excellent. But every action hero had  a back story, which could be explained with a piece of art and a story behind them. OOOHH SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES.\n\nThat said, I really enjoyed the game, and I cant wait to play it with my Brother. but he will say the same thing. "ALMOST HAD THE ULTIMATE GAME"\n\nGraphics? EXCELLENT for this particular game, It could use some more animations when the game runs at 60fps, but the combat is more important. it needs to be fast and furious, so UNLOCK THOSE ANIMATIONS SO WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN ATTACKS.\n\nI especially Liked the last boss, and if you look in the background, We all know who should have wont "the last dragon". Still, Bruce leroy would have been a cool unlock.\n\nOverall, as it is, I highly recommend it, and I wish I could modify it to meet my needs, because this game basically is everything I ever wanted.Just not loose enough, but easily fixable with a patch. (smooth meaning, no consistent flow between fighters, and the fast strikers have an advantage over the method fighters, meaning nobody will pick the method fighters, Halving the roster of playables. ADD THE PARRY SYSTEM. HIGH BOCK HIGH, LOW BLOCK LOW.)\n\nBuy it, enjoy the beats, and the graphics and the gameplay. If the creators go ack to it, it could be the best fighter out there, because as much as I love TEKKEN and other games like it, I LOVE THE CHARACTERS IN THIS ONE.\n\nSo as a fan of fighting games and a purist,\n\n7/10\n\nmake the combat fixes\n\n10/10\n\nI WOULD BUY EXPANSION PACKS.\n\nyeah I said it.\n\n\n\n","October 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The characters control well, and I find it has a measure of depth in its simplicity. The characters are very different in play style, which helps to keep it fresh, as you explore the various combatants. Though I admit that I am still very eager to see the roster expanded.\n\nBeautifully rendered stages reflecting sets  from iconic martial arts movies, heavily enriched my visual experience playing through the game. While, the use of "dubbed over" styled voices for the commentator, juxtaposed with old school kung fu sound fx fused with hip hop is a beautiful marriage of sound.\n\nA fighting game based on the heroes from old kung fu movies meshed together in a fighting tounament is a stroke of genius. Backed up by great mechanics, this game is one I would defintely recommend, especially to kung fu fans.\n\nExtra points to using the Shonuff inspired charcter as the last boss, especially with Bruce Leroy draped over that vat of water in the back ground.

Also Bruce Lee was the first fighter I fought, in my opinion he should've been the end fight. Also timer runs to fast, the moves seem out of sync, some are slow and some you cant even see,  the ai needs work as sometimes they seem dumb and will stand far away and do moves, and then instantly they would become awesome fighters, like if you are winning the ai kicks into hard mode.. ??? Also last but not least, all the special movie effects I turned off otherwise it hurts my eyes flickering and trails making it hard to see the moves.

No stupid fireballs or fatalities to take away from the pure kung Fu action. Though this is early access it is darn good. Reminds me of the old Virtua Fighter games in that it is just fighting with no unrealistic speacial moves. The graphics really set the stage and though you have several characters to chose from with thier own fighting styles you can tell whom the fighters are supposed to be in the real world from Chuck Norris, Donnie Yen, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and so on. I got the game for under $3.00 USD and I have spent more than that at the arcades back in the day playing games like this.

Anyone who has seen a few films will instantly recognise the fighters and the stars they are based on.\n\nYou will also be familiar with a few of the backgrounds too such as the colosseum which was the stage for the epic Bruce Lee/Chuck Norris fight (even the cat is there!!!!). A lot of passion  seems to have beed put into this game by its creator and although it is by no means perfect it isn't that far off. It needs a few fine touches added and it could do with a decent indepth story/history for each character and a main plot, but I suppose this is early access and so I will wait and see what happens.  Even if the developer was to abandon the game tomorrow I still wouldn't be disappointed as I really enjoyed recreating some epic fights from some of my favourite films.\n\nThe fact that this is the FIRST Early Access game I have ever even considered buying should say how much I like the content so far.","April 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love how it simulates older martial arts films. However there is a bug that allows you to beat the game on the hardest difficulty by using Toa Lung.

From a pretty solid soundtrack to amazing blocking animations (and sound FX), you're basically playing a Kung Fu film. The characters are pretty recognizable ranging from Bruce Lee to Jim Kelly and the fighting styles feels just like what the game's story implies; 8 stuntment acting as their counterparts.\n\nOnly issues so far is that the hit-box seems a little off at times, the music can get a little repetitive for some, and pulling off some moves feels a little clunky.

But the problem is, when I was playing with my friends, the experience became boring. because the order of the moves are too hard to being correct and the beutiful martial art moves sometimes just beautiful but not effective, so we just beat each other by very boring moves, and it works well, although the mejority of the fighting games are designed in this way, but since you are making a game designed to do a martial art fighting, I think the martial art moves should be more powerful and effective.\n\nThe experience of playing this game makes me recall another game named Tekken, although Tekken had some characters who have super nature powers or who are man made machine, but there are also characters based on real Kung Fu moves, and Tekken is designed in a way that fight by moves, but not long distance fire balls, and what they are in common is that they both don't have ultral-cambo and don't have power bar, but what Tekken did better is the moves, it makes the order of move being simple and by following an order to press the right button, martial art moves come out, and do powerful hit on the enemy, they make the moves not only entertain but also practical.","February 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It has a great cast of characters based on real martial artists such as Bruce Lee and Tony Jaa, each doing an alright job at replicating the fighting styles of those they're based off of. But this game just... isn't very fun. Early on, the game seemed to show promise even though it was rough around the edges, so I wanted to support it, but it just doesn't tap into the potential it has. I realized it needed a lot of work when I first played it, and stopped playing and gave it time because in that state, it was playable, but not too fun to play at all. Sadly, when I came back, I just couldn't find the interest in putting a lot more time in, because the game felt pretty much exactly the same as it did months and months prior. The sound design can be somewhat annoying, especially the sometimes incredibly obnoxious background noises on levels. There are moves that look like they hit, but don't, and moves that look like they didn't hit, but did. The story mode is so barebones, it's hardly worth playing more than once. Why not at least try to make it a big deal that these characters are coming across eachother (In Mortal Kombat X, even if two characters didn't exactly meet eachother, they would still have something to say to eachother at the beginning of the fight, to make it feel more personal, rather than just another fight). That IS one of the selling points of the game, I'd say. Plus, there really is a great cast of characters, great stages (such as the same place where Bruce Lee fought Chuck Norris in Return of the Dragon, cat and all, haha), and a soundtrack that kinda gives off that Wu-Tang vibe that could work with a game like this, but it just isn't enough. I'm a kung fu film fan, but I just don't find any interest in playing this game anymore than I already have.","February 15","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Although, some his moves and roar  are similar. You must ignore the addiitional hair in front and end of his head, ignoring the hand cover like I saw in your previous trailer. Improve his eyes and his 3D view. The AI is weak and not realistic.\nThe other fighters could be more look like as real characters . I hope one by one you add, necessary improvements and corrections for better  experience.\nEquipments\n1- Adding martial arts tools like nonchuk for bruce and ..., and dresses will go your game to brilliant.\n2- Adding fighter's opponents like classic movies, for example Han and Ohara in enter the dragon and ...\nIn the end, I must tell you thank you very much for your enjoyable game.\n","April 26, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Payed it yesterday for a bit and it (almost) feels like a triple A fighting game.There are only 3 points that I would like to mention that prevent it from reaching a perfect game:\n- The first is a lack of tutorial. Since the game has a lot of moves you can easily get confused if you don't play fighting games a lot. This isn't a deal breaker or anything, but it does mean that you have a higher learning curve than with other games.\n- A second point is that the combo's don't feel accurate. I have the feeling that I need to slow down my button presses, becaues if I press too quickly the game only registers the first button pressed.\nSo say I want to press down, then right, then light punch. The game will execute a light punch as if I only pressed down when I press the buttons quickly.\n- The third thing is the roster. I feel there are enough fighters for the game to offer enough variety, but don't expect a roster like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.\n\nThese three points are minor issues I have with the game, so I do recommend buying it, but they should be taken into account since they have an effect on my/your enjoyment of the game.\n\nSomething I didn't and cannot comment on is optimization. When I messed around with after my the last reivew I noticed the game became more responsive when the settings were put on low. Right now I can play on medium, but I didn't try to go higher, so keep this in mind.\nFor reference, I can run Skyrim on ultry high, just like street figher, so my pc isn't/wasn't the problem.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThought I'd update my review again since quite some time has passed. About everything is pretty much as commented above, but I do find it necessary to mention that the start up screen of the game is black while it loads. This took me about 30 seconds to a minute.\nDo not panic if this is the case, just wait a bit and it should have started. The developers are aware of this and it seems that the reason is that the game loads almost everything at start up. So after the load screen at the start the game will not require to load all that much.","January 2, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemy/opponent AI seems pretty dumb, honestly I'm not even that good at fighting games and just enjoy them, but this game made me feel like I was ready to compete in EVO. It's too easy, the visuals are okay, and the SFX are quite grating (especially that one stage with the cat).\n\nHonestly, it was worth the sale price of like 2.75$, but I would advise against paying more than that since outside of the online multiplayer component, there's not much in this game to come back to after going through Story/Arcade Mode once.","December 27, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really wanted to like this, I really wanted this to work. If it was even a halfway competent fighter I would probably forgive it. But it isn't. It is simply bad. Mechanically bad. The controls are beyond stiff, the specials are unresponsive, I feel like there is horrible input lag as if I were online with someone in croatia even when playing against the AI (which exists as far as I know right here in my own computer).\n\nThis game has some cool style, and flawlessly emulates the Kung-Fu personas each of its characters are based off of. The dang Sonny Chiba from 'The Streetfighter' character was enough to make me smile. But it just doesn't play well. I hoped at first it didn't play well do to it being unfinished back when it was in EA. But even now in its supposedly complete state it plays worse than pit fighter.\n\nReally to bad, because for fans of old school Martial Arts flicks like myself something like this woulda been a joy to play. But it honestly feels broken and unfinished.","January 15","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't buy it right away cause I didn't own a decent gaming rig to play it on. Long story short, I got a gaming rig, got the game (on sale - $5 I think) and have played the sh*t out of it.

It's not the deepest fighter, but definitely not brainless either. I had fun playing through the Arcade Mode  on Very Hard and correctly identifying whether the CPU was going to attack high or low. You can maintain spacing and punish whiffed attacks with awesome looking combos, and of course iconic signature kung fu movesets.\n\nA few small gripes I had with the game were the easy jab combos. It's possible to land once and time the next jab to connect an 11-hit whopper easily. Damage scales, but still. Also, I think the achivements may be buggy. I played well over 100 games against my 8 year old niece (winning at least 120 accumulative not consecutive), but the achievement didn't unlock. It is in fact listed as 100 CONSECUTIVE won games, but who plays 100 games in one sitting?\n\nEither way, as a huge martial arts film fan, this game is pretty fun and definitely worth checking out.","February 13","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its not trying to be the next latest and greatest fighting game but it is trying to be and is something unique. Any flaws in the game are acceptable and overlook able there is way to much negativity out there about this game. The developer was trying to do something different and  he did a great job of it! No you don't have to be a 70's kung fu movie fan to enjoy the game. Its different then other fighting games as its not the same old characters series after series after series and best of all its from an Indie developer who will listen to you way more then any big name developer....I have no regrets in purchasing this game and I am very much waiting  for his next title(s) to be released....(shaolin vs wu tang). So if your looking for the next latest and greatest fighting game at minimum move on, but if you have respect for and want to support indie developers and all there hard work and want a fun and unique game this game is for you....With big name developers you will never see unique games like this so for that....\nThanks Jae Lee  :-)","May 4","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found it challenging on VERY HARD. It plays like Mortal Combat 4 in the way your characters move around and hit (which is a good thing), The graphics are a bit outdated, but the art direction is on point (it really feels like those old movies). The characters are great and emulate nicely their source characters (a mod which would replace their names with the actual names woudl be great) in looks as well as moves. There is a lack of  story (if you've watched old kung fu movies you don't need it, but one starting battle-cry for each character would have been great) which would drive the arcade mode.\n\nIs it worth it, maybe yes. Is it worth it if you like old kung fu movies, YES.\n\n","May 15","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
