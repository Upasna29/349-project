The game is largely about crafting and gathering which i found to be very fun, and you can have a house, which is also very fun and has a lot of perks, but there is a limit to how much you can gather or craft in a day because you have "stamina" or Vim that runs out. You don't become aware of vim until a skill reaches lvl 15, but after that you can only gather or craft 100 times, unless you use a vim potion, which you have to craft, so you spend half the day gathering so you can craft so you can gather some more etc. etc. i hate this system and for that reason alone i quit playing. It's a pretty solid game otherwise but again as you can't really buy the items you need without investing real money into the game or grinding for weeks i think it's a waste of time.","November 14, 2014","false","69.0"," 639 of 712 people (90%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","90","639","712","27","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdmagnet/recommended/263540/","nerdmagnet","nerdmagnet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdmagnet/","33 products in account","This game provides almost everything that I would want from an MMO. However, there are a few downsides. I'll start with the bad first.\n\nFirst off is the Vim System. It is kind of a negative thing for the game, but I can understand why it was put in. Vim is sort of like your crafting stamina, and it unlocks when one of your skills reaches 16. After you hit that point, everything you do when it comes to that specific skill will take up Vim points. Now, they do regenerate over time, but it's like every other game that has energy regeneration: few minutes at a time, and you only get one point back at a time. That wouldn't be so bad if you didn't need mass amounts for quests. The more you craft at a time, the more you use (e.g. one at a time for one Vim, or 50 for 150 Vim.) Gathering only takes one for each click, and sometimes you get three items instead of one, so that's not too bad. The biggest issue with this is that it greatly limits what you can do in the game each day. Sure, there are refills that you can buy (with in game tokens that you can earn, no real money required) and perks that cut down on how much is cut out, but if you don't have enough tokens or those perks yet, things can slow down pretty quickly. There are small "free" refills that you can get to drop, like 15 Vim cornucopians, but those aren't very common; there are also big refills, but that requires you to level the skill. If you're running low, and you're only around 10%, you're better off coming back later. The good side of the Vim system, though, is that it DOES slow you down. Without it, you would see level 1s taking up all of the high ranking gathering spots, and people who could actually craft with what's gathered there wouldn't be able to proceed because of the farmers.\n\nSecond off is the way your skills work. (I'm going to be giving you my point of view, since that's all I really have to work with here.) The good thing about the skill system here is that you have 6 set usable combat skills. The bad thing about the skill system is that you have 6 set usable combat skills. Now, on my priest, that's not too bad; I get a personal heal, a shield I can give to anyone, and the rest are damage spells. However, if I want to be able to heal SOMEONE ELSE, I need to find a piece of gear with that specific skill on it. If I want to keep that skill, I have to keep moving it from gear piece to gear piece, and believe me, that can get expensive pretty quickly, especially if you want to keep A LOT of skills that benefit you. If you have more skills that the free slots cover, you have to either abandon all hope for them, or use special stones to be able to tack as many on as that gear piece or weapon has space for. (You can also earn these in game, but if you're like me, and acquire a lot of pieces with great perks, youre going to run out of them VERY QUICKLY. They aren't exactly common for daily bonuses.) However, this does force you to think about which ones benefit you the most, so no one person can hoarde all of the skills and be insanely overpowered.\n\nThe third thing that I found to be a little irritating is crafting costs. Now, to craft things, you need to go to a station with all of the materials required (that you gather yourself) and craft whatever your skill allows. Now, a few friends of mine and I have sort of agreed that it's a "station rent and craft time" cost, but the higher up you get, the more expensive things get. That's a little annoying counting that I have to gather up all of these insane things to craft it in the first place. The sellback value isn't too great for them, either. The most recent thing I crafted cost me around 15 and a half silver, and it sold for a measly 24 copper. Pretty crappy, right? It feels pretty imbalanced. However, with how much hunting and questing most people do to kill time getting back Vim, I suppose most don't notice.\n\nThe fourth thing is the party/friend system. This one isn't necessarily a bad thing; it's just more of an annoyance. When adding someone to your friend list, you have to be standing right there with them. There's no "Add Buddy" button on the friend menu. You have to track them down and do it yourself. And, while we're talking about the friend list, let me tell you what you can do with your plethora of friends. You can see their name (good, that's needed), their level (also good, I suppose), and if they're online or not(very good; I mean, you can't whisper them if they're not online, right?). Aaaand..that's about it. You can't do anything with them. Can't unbuddy them, can't invite them to a party, nothing really helpful for people who are doing their own thing and then decide to be in a party. You have to do all of that stuff in person. (Well, in character, I guess. You don't have to walk all the way to your buddy's house to do things in game.) Oh, and the party invites work the same as a friend invite. Have to be able to click on them.\n\nThe last bad thing that I've noticed about this game is how you discover new areas. In most MMOs that provide a means of fast travel (which, by the way, isn't free in this game. It requires travel stones to go from one area to another.), you only have to enter the area to register that it's been discovered. The two exceptions that I've run into are WoW and this game. Like WoW, you have to activate a specific something to be able to travel there. In this case, there are travel pads that you have to run over. You get a free travel stone for discovering it for the first time, and bam. Area is now open for travel. However, that is also the drawback. If you're entering a new area that is just below, at, or just above your level, you had better be methodical about killing everything along the way. Most areas have the travel pad around the middle of the map if there isn't a town there. If you die before you run arcoss it? Better hope you have a resurrection stone. Don't have any left? You get to try again from the start. It's still labaled as "undiscovered". Better hope that things haven't started respawning yet.\n\n\n\nEven through all of the bad, there are a lot of fantastic things that I love about this game.\n\n\n\nFirst off, it's free. No pay-to-win here. The only thing that I might recommend paying for is extra storage if you like to hoarde everything. But, even that's not necessary. You get a total of three bags to start off with, a vault (with, I don't remember, 25 or 30 spaces?), and, if you decide to get the free house license, ANOTHER storage vault. So, unless you REALLY like to hoarde EVERYTHING you pick up, you don't need to buy anything with real money.\n\nThe second thing I love about this game is that there is no limit to what skills you can learn because everyone can learn everything. Want to focus soley on mining and smithing? That's cool. Want to max out just your plant lore? Go ahead. Want to be a master in all things ore, wood, clothing, food, and potions? No one's stopping you! The sky is the limit, as long as you have patience for all of the Vim you're going to be blowing through.\n\nOther than that, it's really just your basic, run-of-the-mill MMORPG. There's things to fight, places to discover, quests to complete, and lots of fun to be had. If you're looking for a casual game to play alone or with your friends, this one is one that I recommend wholeheartedly. 9/10","February 23, 2015","true","93.2"," 295 of 347 people (85%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","85","295","347","18","2"

This is true and a positive thing.\n\nBut the core gameplay is a brutal GrindAndClickFest with agressive Pay to play concept: even the training missions are about craft 50 items... what means: you sit in the front of the monitor and click in every 3 seconds 50 times.\nAlso, this game is about epic grinding. Really, there are no challenges in the game, the loot and the resources are easy to reach BUT: you have to spend long minutes and hours just to click and click and click on the same spot to have the necessary resources.\n\nAll the gameplay is about just clicking and waiting, clicking and waiting, clicking and waiting.... while there are mechanics to reduce this tedioum, everything points to the shop.\n\nHonesntly, if there would be a reasonable priced monthly fee to eliminate this click fest concept I would gladly pay for it (because I like the world and the relatively simple gameplay, and again the relatively non violent MMO concept).

All of what I descibed below is in there, though some parts edited for your sanity and bugs in the game. Even though it's long, I'll still call it a quick look since it's an MMO. Feel free to skip around if you want a general idea, or just read the short and dirty summary below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-bUgaTg8yc&list=UUsGKrLHOxr2113efbnkp5MA\n\nI'll start off with saying that the first thing you do in this game is get plopped down in a tiny starter area and get asked to kill wolves. Pretty typical right? Well as I went to fight the most docile wolves apparently terrorizing the town, I got introduced to the combat system. You have to stay perfectly still and click buttons, and I STRESS perfectly still. If you move, you cancel your auto-attack. If you turn slightly, you also cancel your attack. Heck, even if you press the attack again, it cancels the attack and you have to wait for the ability to go off cooldown. If that's what the game is like right from the beginning, I can only dread what it's like late game.\n\nBut combat really isn't the main focus of this. Crafting and socializing is. So I excused the dated and poor combat system and continued my journey. What I found out was that you can infinitely gather from nodes that require no effort to get to. It didn't even encourage exploration. Not that there was much to explore. You play in linear zones that push you along a path. But hey, maybe the crafting was where this game shined...\n\nBoy, was I wrong. It was as basic as the gathering. You click on the recipe, and let the game take care of the rest for you. There wasn't even some sort of minigame to make it more engaging. It was just a droll experience of clicking buttons and farting around.\n\nAlright, well perhaps the social part was the point of this. I wanted to try chatting to some peeps, but I rarely encountered another person. And when I did, they were doing the same boring stuff I was doing. But regardless, counting on the community to make your boring game more enjoyable isn't what developers should be hoping for. So it fell flat for me again. Even more when I discovered there wasn't a /dance command. C'mon now? No dancing?\n\nBut I dredged on. And I found several bugs along the way. Sure, I understand most MMO's have them. The games are so big, it's kind of expected. But I don't think you should be encountering so many in the starting zone, probably the most tested place of them all. Why did my character leap into the water and flop like a fish when I asked him just to fish? Why are there strange black squares following me on the ground everywhere I go? Why is a fenced area full of hens called a sheep plot? Heck, I even had a game breaking bug that kicked me out of the game and corrupted my video footage. But even after all that, I suffered through this game some more to give a better review.\n\nMost of the quests. if not all, where simple fetch quests. All you had to do was go to a place sometimes a few feet away to complete them. It's like the quest givers themselves couldn't be arsed to play their own game. The animations are terrible too. Sure, some of the attacks look flashy, but rarely do they actually connect to what you're supposed to be attacking. Walking sideways is the most laughable thing in this game. It was so bad, I actually enjoyed doing it. I even fell off a cliff and my guy was as stiff as a board all the way down. It's just not polished at all.\n\nAnd when I finally reached the last boss of the tutorial, Grimbad the Deadly or something rediculous like that, I just walked right up to him and stared at him. He didn't even attack me. The big bad boss just aimelessly wandered around, looking for a way to escape his cruel fate.\n\nThat just broke me. There is just no immersion in this game. I couldn't get a feel for it, and the point of MMO's is to lose you in their world, which this game failed miserably at.\n\nBut after being so negative, I'll list a few positives. I like the jumping flips. You go so damn high when you get a boost from some boots. I like that the game's quest helper tells you exactly what to do, even if it does hold your hand too much by saying where you can get stuff. And, umm, some of the bugs were kind of funny? Eh, I guess that counts as something.\n\nSo all in all, even if this game is free, I can't recommend it. There are plenty of better MMO's out there, some free as well. Don't waste your time here.","April 17, 2014","false","3.0"," 694 of 935 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","694","935","5","47"

Character creation is simple and straightforward, sadly there’s not much in the way of customization here, just a few sliders with generic options. There are four classes to choose from, Warrior, Wizard, Hunter and Priest. Each offer their unique ability skill trees and are good for their respective combat role.\n\nThe combat system is somewhat traditional with a few curve balls along the way. You right click an enemy to enter combat and your character will auto attack. Beyond this are your skills and abilities, these are activated by either clicking the hotbar icon or using the corresponding number. You obtain your skills and abilities two ways, first you have a set amount of class abilities that you can unlock and upgrade through levelling. Secondly, the weapons and armour you use will also carry both active skills and passive abilities. This means that if you change your weapon you can end up with different abilities and this can change your play-style to some degree.\n\nQuesting in the game is very text book MMO, go to quest giver, do quest, hand in and move on. That being said I like how some of the quests tie into the games crafting which I'll go into in a moment. There’s plenty of questing content to go through in villagers and heroes in fact there's over 1000 quests and the storyline of the game plus it's expansion the fury of the stone lord is a fun story to go through.\n\nIn zones and dungeons on top of your run of the mill enemies and bosses, you also have bounty enemies. Bounty enemy locations show up on your minimap and offer great rewards, even better they are soloable. Meaning you don't have to miss out on the XP, gold and loot that bounties provide. Speaking of loot, there’s plenty to be had and its a well designed system. Loot from enemies will contain gold, animal parts for crafting, weapons, armour and more. Those who enjoyed Diablo 2 will recognise the name Steig Hedlund, Hedlund was the lead designer on the most widely loved Diablo game, he is also the designer of the item, loop drop and crafting system in Villagers and Heroes.\n\nIn my opinion the crafting system is one of the biggest draws to the game. There are 10 crafting professions: Fishing, Mining, Bug Collecting, Plant Lore, Woodcrafting, Smithing, Cooking, Tailoring, Gardening, and Ranching. Gathering resources is simple and straight forward, simply find a node be it a mining node, fishing spot etc and flesh it out. Nodes also have levels, so as you level your proficiency you'll be able to mine higher level nodes for higher and rarer materials.\n\nThere’s also Gnomenting with is short for gnomish augmenting, this is the crafting ability to combine crafted gear,elder gear from defeating lair bosses and rare randomly found exotic gear. The developers didn't want to have the most powerful gear exclusive to the end game bosses and wanted to make crafting more meaningful. It allows the player to combine different gear in the way of their choosing. Since about half the spells & abilities come from gear & weapons, this means that some very powerful and unique items can only be created and not looted.\n\n\n\nThe best thing about crafting is not only the amount of things your able to create but how easy and accessible the whole system is. It's easy to use, easy to get into and easy to progress. While the game is not a true sandbox, it has a lot of sandbox features, crafting feels more of a joy than a painful grind. Also due to the fact that crafting is very meaningful, it means that crafting benefits you overall in the game rather than it just being a separate part.\n\nAnother big draw of the game is the player housing and village system. Once a player purchases a property, they become part of that village. Villages are player created and there are two types, open where anyone can join or guild specific. Player housing itself is very customizable with not only the ability to customize the appearance of your house but the ability to both garden and ranch animals in your own land. It means especially those looking for an immersive experience you can live on your own little farm with crops and animals of your choice.\n\nVillages themselves are also not just plots of land, they are upgradable. Villages can be levelled up by members of the Village with better facilities such as a forge and more. Villages can also grow and expand in size by opening up new neighbourhoods providing housing for more players. The developers are planning to push the village feature further in the future by allowing villages to create their own dungeons and having Village vs Village warfare, where by villages plunder each others dungeons for loot, special relics and more.\n\nNow as I've mentioned the game is a free to play which means of course there is an in game store. However its certainly far from being pay to win. The contents of the cash shop are simply cosmetic items and items that provide boosts to things such as resource gathering. There’s nothing that could really be considered as pay to win. That being said the cash shop is a little pricey but there’s really nothing you need to progress or get enjoyment from the game, which is a good thing in my opinion.\n\nVillagers and Heroes is one of those rare games that sure, it's not perfect and its no big budget MMO but what it is, is a joy to play. Its very rare that I play an MMO and don't feel pressured to be doing anything specific, or to be rushing through content. Villagers and Heroes provides a pleasurable gameplay experience. The way the crafting, player housing and village system is designed, it really promotes a sense of community in the game. Playing with other people to complete village projects and more is fun and a enjoyable experience. It's also a game that may well appeal to the roleplaying community as theres housing, crafting oh and chat bubbles.\n\nIf your an avid mmo'er who is looking for hardcore PVP or PVE, frankly you won't find it here. However if your looking for an MMO that’s a fun way to spend time playing with people that’s not too demanding on your time and energy then its right up your alley. The game is by no means perfect in any shape but the developers at mad otter have clearly tried to create a community focused game and have crafted the whole thing very well. I would also add that its a mmo that is very accessible to people who haven't played mmo's or are looking for a more relaxed casual experience with a good, helpful community.\n","April 22, 2014","true","1.3"," 248 of 357 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","248","357","3","12"

There were a few criteria for our search: 1) Both of our machines had to be able to run it (she has an older laptop with a low-end graphics card; 2) It had to be free (not interested in subscription-based MMORPGs); 3) It had to have a 'casual' feel to it so that we could focus enjoying the game rather than trying to figure it out. We sifted through the Steam searches, and came across this one.\n\nI've seen Villagers and Heroes decribed as the "not too smart, but cute love-child of World of Warcraft and Runescape." After sinking 26 hrs into it, I'd say that description is pretty accurate. It's not a very complex game, but it's a fun game. My wife enjoyed a lot more of the gathering/crafting -type quests, and I was much more interested in the dungeon crawling and boss matches, but we were both able to play through the game together and have a lot of great nights with it.\n\nThe only CON that I need to add in here is the housing system. We were both really excited to purchase houses in one of the villages of the game, but they just act as inventory space (you can't enter them, customize them, or anything). Furthermore, you need to sign into the game every week to pay your 'rent' to keep the place... and I'm away for work quite often so when I came back after a project, both of our houses (and all of our stuff) was gone. I submitted an in-game ticket for support, but one month later I still haven't received a response. Damn.\n\nOh well, it was still a lot of fun while it lasted. If I get a response back and our stuff is recovered, we may take it back up again.","November 29, 2014","true","26.2"," 108 of 149 people (72%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","72","108","149","25","5"

It's not bad, not by any length, but there simply is no nuance. You click a mob, press some hotkeys and loot falls out of said mob. Luckily, this game isn't about combat. So far, I'm having a blast with the amount of options presented to me. I can mine ore and make it into ingots ('pigs' in-game) and trade them to my neighbour for some of his or her fine produce they harvested from their garden. I can become a tailor and create garments from the loot drops my more combat-oriented village-mates receive. Oh yes, there is a housing system; you join a village and contribute to the betterment of everyone while also gaining materials and xp. A good example would be Runescape's Clan Citadel system, except the materials you gather go to you and you decide whether it goes back into building the village.\n\nOverall, the game is a fun little timewaster played with friends. Graphics are so-so for an MMO, NPCs greet you in different voiced languages (yay Slovak) and there are plenty of kill-list quests. I recommend turning off click to move - you'll figure out why when you play.","April 18, 2014","true","18.2"," 128 of 194 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","128","194","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onyxoasis/recommended/263540/","onyxoasis","Tabby_Honey_Hybrid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onyxoasis/","72 products in account","My take on Villagers and Heroes\nPros:\nLots of crafting to do\nYou can find all the materials you need in the world\nLack of Vim or energy system (removed in past patch. I saw this was a major reason for negative reviews in the past)Cons\nGets boring as you go further in\nLack of motivation to continue with lack-luster storyline\nAuction House is empty, I would never be able to make money off of how the player economy is in its current state\nEmpty feeling community\nMany bugsFurther Examination and Review    I have to say, I had some hopes for this game. I've always loved mmos that carry a heavy focus on PVE rather than PVP. When I saw this had a dynamic crafting system, I was quite pleased. I've played Runescape and several other rpg mmos that mimicked the style of Runescape over the years, I figured I would  give this one a shot and see how it hold up. And it did not.\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention had to be the lack of ambition this game gave me. In games like Runescape, I was always working towards a specific, achievable goal. I saw all the cool things you could do with construction downt he line, so my goal was to level construction. I saw all of the sick skill capes people earned through their hard work, I figured I could maybe try for one as well! In Villagers and Heroes.... Not so much. I mean even RPGMO had some interesting skills that made you wanted to level and achieve even with the old-school graphics and lack of aniamtions. Villagers and Heroes led me on a wild goose chase throughout the internet to find out what I could do with say, smithing or mining? Is mining a good source of income on the player market? Do I get cool capes or titles or SOMETHING from achieving the highest level? Why should I sit here and grind all day if nothing will come of it?\n\nThe second thing that caught my attention was the stale and empty "Auction House". This is supposed to operate much like any other player market in any standard mmo. For example in the Grand Exchange in Runescape, the economy was always bustling. The demand of the market flowed naturally in a way I was able to take advantage of and profit from. It was fullfilling to find out new ways of making money. In Villagers and Heroes, however, there were several things on the market one could purchase, but rarely anything people were willin to buy. I found it fairly difficult to find demand fro any of the materials I had wanted to sell.\n\nLastly, the community seems pretty dead. There are only a few people on at a time it seems. The villages seems pretty empty, which is a shame because I though that player owned villages was a cool a neat Idea. I wanted to join one, but could find none that were active! I think a lot of this game's woes stems from this huge problem, but I can't say I blame people for wanting to stay away from the game. This game has a Vim or energy system in the past, that made it so that players could only do so many gathering actions a day (correct me if I am wrong). After something like that is implemented, I could imagine many people moving on to better organized mmos! I just feel that after the beginning fiasco of this game, it will be hard for it to recover.\n\nI also wanted to mention the amount of bugs I experienced over the first hour of gameplay. I had a few visual bugs that I blamed on my own system. But then I started getting bugs that compeltely strained gamelay for me. For instance, I would go to talk to an NPC, only to have to wait a minute for the bubble to pop up. Sometimes quests would not be fullfilled even after I turned them in, and I would have to do them all over again. This happened specifically with the tailoring master during the first crafting quest. this really bogged down my gameplay.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty "meh" experience. It left me wanting something more from it, it made me miss Runescape more than anything because of how unsatisfied I was. the community is slow to grow, if anything at all, and it severely impacts things like player economy, villages, guilds, and other aspects of the game. It doesn't seem like people are going to go back to this game for a while after some decisions made by the developers in the past that pushed a lot of people away. If it does recover and become and interesting game to play, I will most certainly change my review. However, in its current state, I cannot recommend it over other veteran games that have conquered the PVE style for decades like World of Warcraft or Runescape[//i].","January 9","false","15.6"," 71 of 105 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","71","105","4","2"

The choice of house style is far more important as changing house style cost gold, which you'll earn by killing monsters and doing quests. Each style has its own variations and each variation has its own perk, so plan ahead what perk you want for your character. Choose the style in accordance to the perk you want, even if the variation with that particular perk is not available when you start off. You can always buy the variation you want as soon as you have placed your house. Changing one house styles to another cost a lot of gold (120 gold) though, so it's better to choose the right style to begin with and then just buy extra variations to that style, which is cheaper (30-90 gold).\n\nThis game does not deserve the bad cred it's gotten. It is constantly being improved on. There is lots of people playing it (based upon playing the EU server) and the community is really friendly and helpful. You can play it on your own but it's a lot more rewarding and fun being a part of a guild.\n\nThat you can use real money in the game is not blatantly obvious. It is a fully functioning game for free. Would you like to customise you're character a bit more though, you can visit the shop and buy extra stuff with real money.","April 21","true","526.0"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","1"

They've removed several things from the item shop (including buying gold) that made it seem that way. Ya, there are some items in there that can make the game easier, but it is still possible to play fine without them. If you watch the forums, there are often events that go on, and you can win crowns or item shop prizes from those. The game also doesn't have pvp, so its not like you're going up against other people. Additionally, this prevents a bunch of bratty kids from wanting to play, so the game is pretty peaceful and friendly.\n\nThe community is a huge part of the game too. The game is family friendly, so you do not get people flamming others and yelling profanities at everyone just for the heck of it. It also means that the game is not sexualized like so many other games.

However my actual play time is over 6,000 hrs via /playtime feature in the game.\n\nShort history, I found this game a few years ago, instantly attracted to its charm.  It is my first of this type, with the crafting mechanic etc in it.  But I have tried several games since and nothing comes close to what i'm looking for in a game as much as this one does.  I did leave (for about a year) because of some graphical/movement update that kind of took me out of the game because, well... I'm not good with changes apparently, lol..  There literally wasn't a day that went by that I didn't wish that I was playing it again, but because the new movement etc was so foriegn to me, and gave me a headache.. I just didn't try.  It took an entire year to make myself try and get used to it, and wow am I so glad I am back.\n\nThe game has improved drastically (from what was already a pretty great game).  The new starter area that has been rolled out is impressive, the story line very much intrigues me.  But it isn't all about the story line.  Sure the quests are great, combat is pretty fun (nothing overly complicated but not too simple either), crafting has certainly changed since I first started playing (and changed for the better I might add.. even tho i had no idea it could be improved!)\n\nYou could call me a fan boy (or girl would be more accurate) and you'd be right, but with great reason.  This game has such charm to it, the community is great, helpful, and only on rare occassions will you run into 'trolls', etc.  I think this is in HUGE part to the No PVP...  Just because personally, I feel like it can sometimes bring out the worst in even the nicest of people.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is really great...

It's an RPG with some elements and technics which can't be found in many games. Well the controls aren't great, but it's not a problem. There are many great things to see. The graphics are beautifully animated, and it looks like a cartoon. The shaders aren't bad as well. But let's speak about the gameplay...\n\nThere are 4 classes: Warrior, Mage, Hunter and Priest, and they have they'r own unique skills. You can craft things, from materials which you need to gather, and the crafted items are better than those you find sometimes.\nTheres even a portal to Villages, where you can buy a house. Theres a limited number of plots in a village, but it's awesome. You can design your house the way you want, and you can make a farm behind it. A house costs 20 Crowns, (Crowns can be bought with real money, 20 Crowns = 1,46 Euros i think) but it's worth it. In a village you can find every material.\nNow about the gathering and the crafting system...  There are lots of crafting and gathering activities, and each of them has it's own level. So if you mine ores, you get 100XP if you find some, and for some XP you get lvl-ed up, and you may get better ores.\n\nI think this game is pretty awesome, it has some bugs, but it's a new game, updates will come and it will be better. I would give a 7/10 for this, and not because the graphics, it's the game itself. (Graphics can't make a game awesome, only a bit better, it's the gameplay, and the mechanics what a game needs)\n\nForgot to mention i played hundreds of MMOs which are more worse, so give it a try!","April 21, 2014","true","10.8"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","26","40","0","0"

For the most part it is large empty spaces without much in the way of adventure.  The coloring is very cartoonish with little to no texturing.\n\nStory/Quest Lines:  The story can be rather humorous, however the generic grinding system leaves one rather bored.  Combat can be really buggy.  Mobs sometimes don't aggro immediately.  When ignoring mobs and running away, they will eventually drop aggro but will suddenly come back.  Mobs will sometimes randomly respawn immediately after killing them.  While testing out the archer my auto attack would randomly just stop and I'd have to attack, again to get it working.  Very buggy.\n\nCrafting System:  The crafting and gathering is even more boring, as one can pick from the same tree until you have all of the materials that tree or resource supplies that is needed.\n\nIf you are of the younger generation of gamers and have little to no experience with MMORPGs, this would be great for beginners.

People who made this game have thought a lot. And yes, it is non violent and non sexist, with classic music ambience :)\nReally, you will enjoy to play this game if you're not PVP adicted and if you seek a  smart and no-grinding craft game.\nAnd it is free, try it.\n\nNota : at level 16 in crafting/gathering you will be granted of an energy (VIM) bar : the famous action bar of many facebook-like games.  If you're a full time gamer, you will quickly solve that problem : you will create another or two other character specialized in a few skills. While one is refilling his energy bar for woodcrafting or tailoring the other is exploring maps and emptying his energy bar gathering. There are other ways to gain VIM : gardening, events, management of your leveling, tokens in Gorge; etc\nIf you're lazzy or have few free time , you could simply spend all your vim in 2 clicks, focuse on village tasks or on mob chasing.\n\nMy last explaination lead me to the conclusion : H&V is not a fast leveling pvp game and will attract merely mature players. Or younger ones without blood thirst. This fact explain why community is so peacefull, helpfull and ... well, nice.

The thing I loved right off is the simplicity, the easy going feeling you get while playing, the easy controls. I hate complicated controls, I detest the games that constantly tell you..."Go here now, do this now". I never want to see the inside of another PVP game in my life! There is no pressure in this game to do anything, you can stand still and watch, chat, look at stuff or you can actively quest or bounty. You compete against yourself! You don't have to prove anything or fight anyone.\n\nI am hoping that people reading the negative reviews (and even video's) posted by people who never even went past the introductory or the tutorial sections but still posted negative reviews will at least try the game and decide for yourself. Please do not be swayed by what other gamers feel and blindly follow someone elses lead. This game is most definetly not a hardcore game. It's not a kill each other and your friends, race to be the top dog, the first and the best. It's meant to enjoy by yourself or by you and your friends both old and new. The community is really great! The players are a wonderful group of people from all over the world, both young and old.\n\nI also love that this game was built showing respect to all players and to women especially. It's not filled with bubble-headed bimbo's, scantily clad in what they called armor, but I call disappointing scraps. Some of the very reasons the "hardcore gamers" post they do not like about this game are some of the very reasons I do like it!\n\nSo instead of letting someone else tell you how to feel about the game, how about trying it for yourself?","April 19, 2014","true","9.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

When I first seen it in the store I was like.. Ha... Not even worth a minute of my time. But I've been looking for an MMO and I figured... WHY NOT its only like 800MB... Downloaded in minutes and was up and ready to play. Now I will say this, the game crashes to desktop a little more often the I would like, The graphics even on absolute max are not anywhere near the greatest, and yes, in my personal opinion it IS pay to win (Pay to advance rather).\n\nBut just after giving this game a little over an hour of my time I suddenly found myself in love with the atmosphere, they did fairytale style MMO just freaking perfect. From some of the beast's to classes, to crafting. It's also a strong plus that all the NPC's say something in Germen... Lol... Funny little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... But anyways, The game Had my heart and soon after that hour I was drudging on 9. I Wasted my entire DAY on this game... and I ENJOYED IT...\n\nAll in all, for someone looking for something to just let out their inner child, get lost in a fairytale and enjoy a great little game that doesnt have people spamming up the chat with bots or gold farming services, then this is it. This is freaking it...\n\nI hope you enjoy the game as much as I do. And if you feel like joining me on a quest or would like to just jump in and forage some mushrooms with me then thats cool too... cause you can do that....

(As is the case in these times!) The setting and graphics are calming and charming. It is a relaxing game.\n\nCrafting and gathering are plain but interesting. Because there are many random drops and it urges you to try gathering "one more time" and "one more time".\n\nCombat is the weak side of this game. But the devs are saying that they will improve it and get rid of the "stay still to attack" feature.\n\nSocial options are enough. There are many friendly people. Maybe PvP should be introduced properly as well. IT is a big MUST.\n\nQuests are typical MMO quests. Humor is nice. There is no voice-over, but that is not something strictly needed from a MMO after all. And F2P too.\n\nCurrently it has many bugs and glitches and the servers lag. If i think these would persist, i would hate this game. But i hope they will fix those issues. Then it will be a perfect game.\n\nIf you have children, or siblings, or friends, gather them and play this game together. Partying makes it much more fun and better. You can play with your children safely as there is nothing explicit.\n\nI would like to thanks to the developers for they opted to make something unique in the F2P mmo genre. I hope the game will be improved a lot, and become fantastic!","April 18, 2014","true","19.6"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

This game doesn't disappoint.  The crafting materials are detailed and diverse, though it does take dedication to progress high in the levels.  Each crafting class will helpe the others, so leveling them all is beneficial, though not necessary.\n\nThe action aspect is the least exciting to me, though also reflects what I"m least interested in. I've only been playing since the "reborn" reset of sorts, and there have been some lag and other bugs that have needed working on.  As far as I can tell , the staff is hard at work ironing out all the bugs.  There are not a huge variety of adventure classes to choose from, but what there is is very customiziable, which I appreciate.\n\nMost of all, I have come to really appreciate the community.  The players, especially the longtime players, are committed to helping newer players get their bearings and learn the game.  Everyone can contribute to help community goals, especially building of newer villages, even if you are lower level.  I've asked a lot of "newbie" questions and always received very helpful advice.  I have played a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes out there, and I find that it is always the community of players that distinguishes games.  This game has a great community base, and I look forward to spending more time playing it.\n\nIf you are looking for a fast, bust through and win game, this might not be for you. But if you are looking for a nice place to settle down more casually, get to meet some new friends, and learn and have fun at your own pace, I would highly recommend giving this game a try.  Stick with it if you try it soon, give the dev's a chance to iron out the new bugs, I think this game is going somewhere great. Best of all, you do NOT have to spend money to succeed!!

I first thought I had to pay real money to get the licence to own a house, but you will get it if you do simple quest.\n\nFighting seems to be way to easy so far, but it's just low level and will probably get more difficult later on. The controls feel a bit clunky, but I can live with that, just something I have to get used to. The different skills and professions seem to be more entertaining so far than in similar mmo's like WOW.\n\nAs for the size of the world I cannot say anything yet, but looking at the world map it seems big enough. It's not as open as WOW but all the zones are connected through portals. For a free to play game I would definitely reccommend this game so far. Stuff you have to pay for is mostly cosmetic and for your convencience, so no pay to win here.\n\nI would suggest everyone to at least finish the tutorial until you get to the city and to villages to see the potential of the game. Because it may look a bit dull at the very beginning.\n\nI do like the friendly community so far and the Dev's have already addressed some of the issues the game has and people complained about, like not being able to attack while moving and they are currently working on it. Good to hear.\n\nAnd I do like the art design and cartoony looks.

At ultra it's nearly unplayable in cities. Also I've lost 3 characters because they are "lost in space" between loading screens. They are stuck since days. Second thing - I don't know what devs where doing, but new character is using 5-lvl gear at the start. If you will change something in your eq you can't use these items untill lvl 5. Logic? What the f...? Third thing - combat, it's nearly turn-based. Every mob or player is dealing max 1 attack per second, combat is bugged, very often the game isn't responding for actions or attacks. Loot drop is pathetic - who will first attack the boss gets 100% of loot, Forth thing - nearly everything you can buy using in-game Premium Shop. Everything.

Depending on the level of the resource you get anywhere from 25-100 exps per resource. Yeah, try getting to level 12 where you need 30k exps in that particular resource. Everytime you pop a level, your exps drop to zero again. Takes for friggen ever to get anywhere. One quest requires you get to level 10 in everything. You have 10 skills plus your charater level. At 5 hours of mostly resource gathering, my average level was around 8. Makes for a really exciting game.\n\nI upgraded my tools, didn't make any difference, still gathered at the same amount, the same items. I really don't find it fun where I have to click for an hour on the same resouce constantly, then move on to the next resource and so forth. Go craft you stuff, sell want you can and go back again for more resources.\n\nOther annoying thing I found was it's only 1 player per resouce. And I don't even see the point of have 5 resources of varying levels, where the only one that does anything for you is the highest level one.\n\nGame penalizes you for not playing! Costs 1000cp per week to have a house. I don't see myself ever getting one.\n\n5 hours of game play and I never ever want to play this junky game again. And yeah, it's a bit buggy as well, sometimes you click and nothing happens. Or you select a target and all of a sudden you're shooting at some other target and so forth.\n\nAtleast it's free, and when you get bored, just delete it, having lost nothing but time.\n\nJust looked at the store page, WHAT trading cards? Where? 5 hours I got nothing.","February 28, 2015","false","5.3"," 49 of 88 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","49","88","8","2"

I have also been unsuccessful with using third-party programs to force a frame-rate lock or vSync.\n\nSeriously. Why isn't there some way to cap the FPS? It's 2014!

No one has a monitor that runs beyond 200Hz.\n\nI have a pretty beefy computer that can play pretty much everything on max, and this game puts more stress on my system than any other game. Why? Because my damn graphics card is running it at 700~ FPS. They are redundant frames. The game does not need to run at 700 FPS when my monitor only refreshes 60 times per second.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/recommended/263540/","Littlenymph","littlenymph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/","61 products in account","Villagers and Heroes is a classic MMORPG that has been compared to the likes of Runescape and WoW. While I feel that a direct comparison to these games is less than accurate, I would go so far as to say that players from these other titles will find it an easy transition in terms of game play and mechanics. If you have not played these other titles, you will find that the base mechanics of game play are not that difficult to pick up on, thanks in large part to the games opening quest which serves double duty as a well crafted tutorial. While the game offers many of the traditional aspects found in other games of this genre, it has an acceptable learning curve. The main thing that differentiates this game from those previously mentioned is that it is more casual than hardcore, which results in a friendlier community than the average game of this nature.\n\nLike many other games in the fantasy genre, V&H has a medieval setting in which characters engage in three related aspects of game play. Combat and exploration, gathering, and crafting. There is an additional element of game play with the inclusion of villages. Characters can join join a stand alone or guild village where they maintain a house which grants additional storage, raise crops in their own gardens, and maintain a small ranch which yields components useful for crafting.\n\nDespite being squarely in the middle of a somewhat crowded genre, V&H offers a few aspects that make it somewhat unique. The most unique aspect in my mind is an add on to crafting referred to as the Gnog station. Through gnoging, a character can take existing gear and modify its looks and aspects. They can add and remove the various feats and abilities inherent to gear to create custom gear tailored to the individual needs of the character. Another feature that was added just this past year is the ability for a character to be "Reborn" which allows them to reset their combat stats and advance their character with bonuses, without the loss of non-combat achievements. My most favorite aspect of the game however does not have so much to do with the game itself as it does the games community. The owners and staff at Mad Otter Games have a reputation for being receptive to their customers, which results in player driven development. In actual game play, a player will find the game itself to be well moderated, which results in a play environment remarkably free of Trolls and Drama-llamas. Of all the on-line games I have played, Villagers and Heroes has perhaps the most friendly and welcoming community that I have ever encountered.\n\nRead more: http://mm-mysticalts.proboards.com/thread/270/villagers-heroes-revised-01-2016#ixzz3wfpDGkPC\n\n\n~LL\n\n\n*Notes:\n\n(1) I played this game for over a year before making a Steam account for it. My client account is my primary account. My hours on record as a Steam player are less than a tenth (at best) of the actual hours I have put into this game. Just saying............ :P\n\n(2) Several updates and improvements to this game since the mid point of 2015 have prompted me to revise my original review.

Mattering on what your internet is. Usually I'm working on doing either main quests or side quests and then it takes me back to where i was a second ago and turns me into a different direction. I dont know why that would happen but Im saying that its probably because of server performance.\n\nGameplay 8/10: When it comes to Gameplay it really matters on where you are and what your doing in the game. Monsters are hard to take down when your 2 levels below it's level and not equiped with any potions. I dont like the main boss that you have to take down at the beggining (Donalda Declancy) with 1800 health and a fast health regen rate as a level 10 boss. I was level 9 when i battled her and it was hard as heck, but another player who was level 11 came in and helped me defeat her. It is really hard to level up but with quests that give you almost 3000 experience its actually smarter to do quests rather than xp farm.\n\nGraphincs 7/10: Graphics arent bad, but not great. The graphics just arent as good as some of the other rpgs that ive played.\n\nOver all my score for the game itself would be an 8/10. I am recommending this game because it is a good game but could use just a little bit of work.\n\nEdit: The server stability is actually ok for the most part, it was just my old internet.","June 21, 2015","true","17.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The aspect of being "reborn" is also something that I have not experienced with other games that I have played.  You also have the choice to quest and fight, or craft and gather, or both.\n\nThe big plus of V&H is the community.  The players are amazing helpful people, and then that compounds if you become a part of guild.  People are willing to help you whether they know you or not.

I actually kind of liked the game and I think it has lots of potential.\n\nYet the main reason I would not recommend this game is because it is a massive grindfest with no enjoyable+ added into it. The gathering system seems to be somewhat okay compared to the crafting system. The crafting system is unbelieveable. Espescially after making lots of digging and finding out the grinding amount I have to do to level up my craftings, the game was over for me. Seriously you dont want to click that much, just no.\n\nOther than the absurd crafting system, the game is very unfinished with unconsistent art here and there. You see really annoying and buggy stuff generally.\n\nAs for some pros, I would recommend this game for some chilling with friends. The storylines were really fun and the humor is pretty goodly constructed. NPC voices are also okay.\n\nGenerally the game is a 4/10 for me.","July 22, 2015","false","22.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","1"

Warning: you can only garden and ranch in a village, and as of writing this review the only way you can have a sure spot in a village is if you join a guild with one. If you're into PVP and combat this most likely wont be the game for you as the combat falls rather short for a typical mmo, however being a combat person myself I still found enjoyment in some quests and mat farming.

I played this game the first day it came out, and I'm not going to lie, it was very glitchy.\n\nThe game is an MMORPG by an indie company, and it's only the first week, of course it's going to be glitchy. They are currently on top of everything, so hopefully the game is all fixed up and clean this up coming week.\n\nOn with the review... If you've played and liked Runescape, you'll love this game. It is a skill and stat based game. You do little things to level up every skill possible. Picking apples is a skill, cooking is a skill, fishing, crafting, smithing, all that stuff. You start off on a tutorial island just like Runescape where you can learn all the skills and start a main quest.\n\nThe controls feel a bit weird but they are very easy to get used to.\n\nDon't fall for all the negative reviews.

Building a character with a wide variety of skills that produce stuff is always fun.  The game does not disappoint; I had a blast harvesting a huge variety of items and it was easy to start making quality gear from what I found.\n\nMy problem with the game is with the questing.  Remember back when the first WoW expansion, The Burning Crusade, came out and the quests in the new zones were streamlined and really fun (at the time)?  Remember how awesome Ghostlands was, because the zone rewarded you for completing the quest line and you didn't have to traverse the world to do it?\n\nWell, the questing in Villagers & Heroes is very much like the questing was in WoW, before BC came out.  In short, a pain in the rear.  Its a serious slog to level up via questing here; the interface is not friendly enough to group your quests by zone, and there's some other glitches (missing quest markers) that twerk your day.  You're going to want to purchase some virtual wings (teleport stones) because your feet will be tired from the running.\n\nDespite all of that, getting to level 14 was actually a pleasure.  I may see how far I can get just harvesting and whatnot, but more questing from here on feels like a bad-paying job.","July 7, 2015","true","24.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The quests where the same as any other MMO but thats expected. While trying to kill mobbs other players would always get the first hit and then i would have to wait a couple of mins so i could complete the quest, that was annoying. After about 30 mins i got out of the starter zone and picked up a quest to join a village and get a house. I was expecting something like wildstar where i can place things in the house and move stuff around but couldnt even walk in, it was just a bank, put stuff in and take stuff out. The houseing was dull. Then wanted to look around the villege and was also hoping that it was like SWG and that you could place stuff anywhere but its preplaced structures and you can only upgrade them with other guildies. After a couple of hours of playing it seemed like a ok MMO but I give it a 6/10. For a free to play game its not that bad.

The PvE side exists (I'm still low level) but it's like the crafting and gathering is the main point of the game and the monsters are like a side quest which is pretty weird to say.\n\nThe list:\nGraphics - Cartoony graphics-ish. They're alright but don't expect RIFT quality.\nGameplay - You mean gathering and crafting? Pretty dang repetitive.\nCombat System - It absolutely sucks. Probably why they avoided PvP? Is there even PvP in this game? No there isn't.\nCommunity - Very friendly and very helpful.\nChat System - It really sucks. Should be replaced immediately...\nAchievements - Yes of course... and they give you gold as a reward for earning them (interesting).\nVoiceover quality - Meh - Some NPC's are great and some others are terrible or too loud/too quiet/bad voice acting.\nGrinding levels? - It appears it's going to be quite the grind to get everything from leveling/crafting/gathering to maximum.\nAuction house - Very meh.\nLag? - No, not really.\nKid friendly? - Absolutely. Have young ones and need to have them do something for awhile? Let them play this.\n\nOverall it's an alright game but wasn't what I was expecting.","April 19, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have only played for a couple hours thus, but I am thoroughly enjoying it.\n\nAs reviews below said, the combat is not fluid at all, but the DEVs are aware of this and are currently working on making it smoother. The gatherng is a huge load of fun, though. It's quick, easy and exciting due to random drops and the ability to discover new items and objects. You will, however, find yourself right-clicking a little more than you'd hope, IMO.\n\nAfter a little more work has been done on this game I think it will be a huge success and it is definitely worth trying out. :)","May 1, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is based on fighting to level up and complete quests, these quests can be for different, there are quests for leveling up your hero, (Eg) your player. there are four main player types, Worrier, Wizard, Hunter and Preist.\nThe Worrier is for heavy close combat fighting. Wizard is for distance, long ranged attacked but not great in close combat same with the Hunter(archer). Finally the priest, it is mainy used for healing but can fight as well. In the game you can go solo or join a party, once you join a party you dont have to stay in it, you can leave it when ever you want. If you are in the same area as some party members you get 50% of the exp they get from attacking a monster.\nAs you have read already there are areas, in Villagers and Heroes there is loads you can explore you start on a island called Ethlos this is where you willl be given a main quest, you do not have to do the quests but it is recommended if you want to level up fast, also the main quest is only to help you level up when you first start and teach you the rules and the ways around the game. Once you have completed it your done with the main and can do side ones.\n\nYou can also join a guild or a village these can help a lot as if you need something Eg (Ore) for smithing you guild or village has a vault where players can put equipment they dont need in it for others to have, the differents between a guild and a village is that you can join a village of the bat were a guild the leader has to accept you in the only way this is done is if the leader invites you.\n\nOnce you are in one of these you can make a house as you go on in the game you will unlock new looks; their are many looks out there also you can farm and breed this is a good way to make money, Money is in copper, silver and gold. 100 copper = 1 silver and 100 silver = 1 gold. monsters drop around 8-15 copper so the best way is to farm or quest. You can also get money from doing achivements.\n\nIf you realy want to get good stuff level up fast or get money fast you can do in game purcheses but i dont recommend this, but its your money.\n\nIm going to stop talking now as i will give away to much and this may stop people playing as they know most things about it.\n\nIf you need help on the game or want tips or if you have any questions just add me and message me, i will try to answer back as soon as i can\n\nHope you start playing its a great game, you nevere know we might be able to fight together.","July 2, 2015","true","45.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is very charming. It reminds or of Runescape a little.\n\nPROS\n- Crafting/gathering system seems very deep. You have smithing, mining, foraging, cooking, tailoring, wood crafting, fishing and bug catching.\n- Player housing. You get to customize it and gain different benefits from doing so. You also gain the ability to grow crops and the ability to raise animals. Once you own a house you get the option to join a village or create one of your own. Villages can hold 35-60 player houses and you will gain benefits the more houses you have in a village.\n- It doesn't seem pay to win so far.\n- Its charming. It doesn't take itself very seriously.\n- Unique backstory creator at the beginning\n- The download was just under 1gb\n\nNeutral\n- The combat system is decent.\n- The graphics aren't bad. Cell shade-y.\n\nCONS\n- The voice acting is hit or miss.\n- Seems too easy so far. Tank and Spank warrior has no trouble with enemies a few levels above him.\n- Some of the quests seem bugged. You're told to go somewhere but the quest wont update.\n- Very limited customization of your characters looks.\n- Only 4 classes with 2 different playstyles to choose from per class.\n- I didn't see many people in the starting area.

It's lacking depth imo, and it's too repetitive. It's basically like any other mmo but just a bit worse. Still, worth to give it a try. I really enjoy grinder games, however this one just takes it to a whole new level - which I like. I find myself yawning most of the time and getting frustrated with the odd spawning rates though. I have yet to try another class beside hunter, hopefully warrior is a lot more fun.","October 6, 2015","false","12.9"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","2"

Submit a ticket for nothing because it falls on deaf ears. If your like me I will never play a game that rips players off.  It promises stuff and doesnt deliver or if something happens to your sever and you have missing stuff like me you bought w crowns which can only be purchased with real money you are SOL. They tell you to submit a ticket and months later they still won't do crap about it so u just get ripped off over and over. I'm so sick of it this is the second time it's happened.

Which I entirly love.  I love to farm and craft, etc.  I could spend all day just farming and crafting and the next day go beat the living snot out of that Bounty Mob that killed me the other day.  In that respect, Its great.\n\nCons : Only problem is, the graphics are a 3/10 at best.  I have been spoiled by many games that are high demand video hogs.  So, this is more of a personal preferance.  Out of the few hours Ive played, The game window has closed 5 times with no warning at all.  Getting stuck in a wall was a pain.  Also the in game village building.... Is always full.  Almost impossible to start your own or settle in one already made.  There is in game purchases which make it slightly P2W, but its almost needed at times.  If your a crafter, the bag space you have is very limited.  IIRC its 2 16 slot bags.  Others you need to buy through in game purchases.\n\nOverall a 4/10.  The Runescape end of it keeps me playing mainly because I've been hankering for a nice MMO RPG to play thats not mainstream.  IT IS F2P at any rate.  Worth a try.\n\n","May 5, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thoroughly enjoying it! Came home from work as a bundle of stress, my usual mmo's were more "work", so I browsed for something  a little more casual or relaxed and found this gem.  Anyone who played Wizardy 101 will recognize the graphics, soft cartoony, colorful, yet easy on the eyes.\n\nAlso, a family friendly game for someone looking to play with their kids. Currently I have stepped out of the 'Heroes' part of the game and am fiddling with housing and crafting. Truly, I can't recommend this game enough for someone looking for a relaxing and fun mmo. Most beautiful part; the microtransactions store does NOT impare the gameplay for those who can't afford to use it. No roadblocks!\n\nI would also like to note, I read reviews from players prior to trying it out. Some had me a bit concerned, however it looks like the issues addressed in this reviews have been resolved. Combat is far more user friendly, no longer locked in place... can run and cast etc. Definitely will not be a "niche" game, very much a mainstream relaxing mmo with a ton of achievements and goals to aim for. Lastly yes there is raiding in high end (I have yet to experience it) and from the death notices I have seen there does appear to be some pvp elements (arenas perhaps?). I am still fairly new to the game, hooked. Let's see if it keeps my love for it!","August 2, 2014","true","20.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Maybe would be ok as a browser game but as a standalone - no way.\nIts called VILLAGERS and Heroes, it announces housing as one of its main features. Almost shocked me to find out that the houses cant be entered. Real Housing was around in mmos about 10 years ago, where you were able to upgrade, customize, add furniture, add crafting tools, invite friends - in games that didnt even mention housing as a feature. None of that is available here, houses are nothing more than storage.\nThe collecting/gathering professions, a huge part of the game, begs you to use macro cheating. Best way to level is to turn on "auto collect", define a key to send left mouse button every 2-3 sec and go afk for a day or two.\nThe graphics were ok maybe 10-15 years ago, i dont get how such thing can be released in 2014.\nThe ui is ok at best, you have all or least most basic informations. Of course you cant change anything about them, Resize/Move? - Lol. Its ok as the game just isnt very complex and a detailed ui isnt needed.\n\nThe Style is comic like, but rather childish, naiv, simple and less cute.\n\nIt also has combat, well a main part of it is combat. You can kill stuff. Thats it. Works. But thats it, no great tactics, group play or whatever, not very dynamic or challenging.\n\nHell, the game is so bad, absolutly not worth writing a single more","June 9, 2014","false","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You get to have a town.. you and many others build houses in this town. you get a farm that you planet, water and grow.  get a ranch for raising sheep/chickens and other things.  in your town you build all the crafting machines (and upgrade them), build the collecting stuff too... like mines/trees/fishing holes... and the material is stocked by using a few items from the real game (apple tree level 1 takes 20 red apples to fill it and then it contains 200 for you to harvest in your town (the apples you get from town can't be used to refill this)\n\nPROS:\nCan build your own town with all your friends (in a guild or not up to you!)\nCan craft weapons and armor\nCan play how you like.. wanna just do crafting and nothing else after the tutorial do it.. your friends can bring you 20\nof any material (ore for example) load it into the towns ore supply and boom you can now mine 200 of that ore\ntype.\nThough it does have a real money shop, it does seem to not be required to play\nCONS:\nIn game real money shop (no matter what this is never a plus in my book, even though this isn't required so it's in the\npro column also)\nSockets, You get a handfull free that's it.. then it's pay or do without.. what are sockets? they are the attrib of your weapon that gives you your attack skills.. without them you have to pick do you want slow shot or poison shot or one of 5 other abilities you can only have 4 without them.\nGame is entertaining for bit but then becomes extremely time killing.. ex: at level 21 you need 120,000 xp to level a craft.  you only get 100 per tree (without any xp boosts, I'm getting 106 in town) so just to get to 22 in gathering you'd have to click a tree/bush/mushroom 1, 200 times. (good luck)\nPAY TO WIN - you can buy things with real money and speed up your leveling .. one guy hasn't bought much been playing 1200 hours and he's only level 54(out of 75) other people have paid for stuff and made it to 75 much faster.\nEDIT: 36 hours in .. completely bored .. there isn't a point no direction can't figure out what's the point.. crafting is good for a while but honestly there is no point cause the gear you find in the wild is better than anything you can craft.\n\nI keep this as a recommend because if  you like crafting and gathering games this one is pretty good for about 30 hours of entertainment .. which is more than I can say for most games I've paid $50+ for","May 14, 2015","true","37.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Why?\n\nWas it the sub-par graphics? No. I can live with graphics being basic, but they are styled to something I'd expect in an MMO about five or six years ago.\n\nWas it the vast emptiness? Also no. While I was on there were NO other players on at all. So these vast villages and towns felt... dead. But even then, I prefer single player games, so I can live with that.\n\nWas it the bugs and massive lag-spikes? Yes. Falling through the terrain became all too commonplace. Several times I would spend five minutes running a metre due to a lag spike forcing me to re-run it. Also, why so much delay between acknowledging I've hit attack/move/speak/craft/open menu (it makes a sound and graphic when you do) and actually performing that function.\n\nSo why the immediate hatred for this game with just a few bugs? The truth is that there are far better free-to-play MMOs out there that nailed down the basics before they decided to get all fancy (Neverwinter, Rift, DC Universe just to name three). Yes, the player controlled villages was a cool idea, whilst every game needs a hook, you should always make a game PLAYABLE first.\n\nPlayers will forgive an average game that has a good (if somewhat buggy) hook if the basics are playable. Why? They'll stay long enough to give the developers a chance to streamline the hooks.\n\nPlayers will not forgive a subpar game that has a good hook if the basics are buggy? Why? They'll abandon it before the developers actually improve the game engine.","April 26","false","1.0"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foreverjustice/recommended/263540/","foreverjustice","Dacoza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foreverjustice/","89 products in account","One of my favourite games of all time. Villagers and Heroes is unique yet it got alot of common to other mmo's and mmorpgs. If you've ever heard of Runescape and you liked that, then you will DEFINATELY love this game. It's addicting and the quests never get boring!\n\nYou can choose classes, whether it's a priest, wizard, warrior or a huntsman. Ofcourse, the warrior uses swords and the huntsman uses bows, and the priest and wizard uses spells and such. You can level up your mining, smithing, woodcrafting, ranching, gathering, plant lore and MUCH MUCH more! And there is one more thing, when you level up the certain skill you get to be able to do other stuff with the skill! Me personally love mining, but that's because I love having money. Mining is a great skill if you want some quick money.\n\nAlso, you can make your own house with your own unique pets and gardens! How cool isn't that?!\n\nThe game is free, yes, but there is still an option to pay to get special perks, however, you're not obligated to pay one single cent to enjoy this game. If you're interested in using real money you can buy boosts and such, but every game has that feature. You can also buy cool clothing.\n\n\n9/10\n*Excellent graphics - With the option to change them to your liking\n*Great community - Everyone, or atleast almost everyone is helpful and kind, really a good place to have a good time!\n*Antihack/cheat - The developers made it sure that it would be absolutely no cheats or bugs what so ever, and if they ever find one they will fix it at the second\n\nI love this game and I hope you will give it a chance too!","May 17, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The animations are terrible and turning in this game using the WSAD controls is dreadful. I'm not sure why the game defaults me to use WSAD controls when they doesn’t even work properly. Also even the NPCs speak to me in a different language majority of the time or have a strong accent. It makes for a very awkward environment, emphasizing that the game isn’t very polished.\n\nThe game is also P2W. Even though there isn’t PvP, paying customers get a huge advantage like better items for gathering, socketing weapons, ect.

The graphics aren't even that amazing and the use of system resources is horrible. I play every game out there on max settings and I was seeing massive framerate drops doing something as simple as turning my character, which brings me back to the terrible controls. Movement is slow, rotation sucks and the whole layout of the movement in this game is backwards. The character modeling is terrible and I had to restart the game oh...about 10 times because it crashed every time I tried to finish my character creation, once I got through the terrible character creation screen (Which is about 85% of my time spent on this game) I was met with the disgusting control mechanism, I spent an additional 10% of my time playing around with graphics settings hoping to baby jesus that somehow they control the ugliness of the modeling, once again was met with disappointment when the models got even more jagged and I could now see (in detail) how terrible their collision checking was for their AI.\n\nAs I turned my character I was met with the terrible disappointment that for these sub-par graphics somehow I am going under 60 frames per second when I can run way more gorgeous MMO's on ultra quality without any issues. This game is a huge disappointment and I feel bad for anyone who wastes money on the in-game content, their global chat is next to dead which goes to show how many people don't want to play this game, because it's bad. I don't even care how many downvotes this gets me, because wow, just wow this game is so bad, please just stop developing this game because the team who handles your coding must still be in highschool. Uninstalling immediately and never looking back to this dark moment in my past. I am going to write this one off as a skeleton in my closet and I am genuinely a little disturbed that a game like this made its way onto the steam market.\n\n\nYOUR GAME IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD.\n\n*Edit as of 11/26/15\n\nThis game is still bad but I want to add that my specs are as follows:\n\nWindows 10 64bit\nIntel Core i7 5820k (6 physical cores 12 logical)\n16GB DDR4 SDRAM (2133MHz)\nNVIDIA GeForce 970 (3.5GB Dedicated VRAM)\n\nThe reason for adding this is so you can all understand I have a machine that is capable of running just about any new release to date on maximum settings, 4K Resolution, etc. without a problem.\n\nAnyway don't play this game, because it's STILL bad, clearly the developers have not listened to anyone or have completely abandoned support for this game. Personally I can't blame them, I would abandon my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stepchild too.","September 27, 2015","false","1.7"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","15","31","3","3"

The art style is simple but still beutiful and colourful you can tell that the creators have put alot of work into this indie game as it allows you to perform different actions such as, farming, fishing, and harvesting wood and ores. The list just goes on and on.\n\nThe rating I would give Villagers And Heroes would be a\n9.5/10\nAs I said the combat isnt the main feature of the game but if they could improve it slightly, maybe by adding some\ndramatic battle music or something like that this game would be perfect and get a straight 10/10 from me!","October 29, 2014","true","2.9"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","15","31","0","0"

'Lacks Visuals, Traveling a'Bore, Indecently Expensive'\n\nComical Liner: 'I once had this game, it was very fun until it uninstalled itself, then I forgot the game existed..'\n\n\nQuick Summary; Before you slip past the scoreboard, I'd like to say.. If this game was specifically for a kid, I'd give it a 5.5 or possibly a 6. The game seems a bit... Underdeveloped. Sure it has it's "Greats" And "Heights" Such as many other games, but this game doesn't have anything to draw itself onto "Uniqueness" - And have something new to the table of MMOs. However, even despite this it can be pretty decent for someone with a lot of time... Otherwise, prepare to spend a lot of time traveling, and playing very carefully as potions derived/created/or bought ingame, are pretty faulty; Except the Paid by real money kind. Enjoy.\n\n\nPros:\n- Game seems appropriate for a 'First time RPG'\n- The look and theme persisted- It had a WoW-like feel, a bit more cartoony.\n- Game is child friendly it seems as well, but that's about where it ends.\n- Crafting seems pretty fun. It's great that you can train any skillset.\n- Combining multi-items into better or more stylish items is neat.\n\nCons:\n- Traveling across this game is tedious; Time-consuming and tedious.\n- Did I mention traveling in the game feels like a grind in itself?\n- If you died, while traveling, get ready to pay real money to revive..\n- Or pay money to travel to wherever you attempt to go.\n- Mana and health dies out pretty quickly, so stock Lots of garbage potions.\n- Reliable, usable, and good potions are only purchasable via Real Money.\n- Generic Quests. i.e. Collect 10 XYZ, Bring XYZ to XYZ, story driven? No.\n- Controls feel like it's still in Alpha, Keyboard and Mouse sometimes conflict.\n- Everything feels instanced, get ready to wait at every turn.\n- Music.. Is.... That's all I can say without violating terms of agreement.\n- Same generic sounds played for everything; NPC, Damage, Damage Taken, etc.\n- I don't recall anyway to "Speed up travels" meaning... Real money to Travel.\n- I was told by a friend you can have a house and XYZ, but it's just a "Stash"\n\nEnding Conclusion; Don't play it unless you really... Really.. Want too, or it's already there for your niece, nephew, son, daughter.. And just wanted to play it. Otherwise, steer away, your money is worthwhile in other Indies that aren't trying to squeeze your wallet.","November 17, 2014","false","0.5"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","8"

It was released on April 17th, 2014, and published and created by Mad Otter Games, and are also well known for The Red Baron Pack. They have had an uneasy track record, and The Red Baron Pack has gotten a mixed reception, and this game is no different.\n\nThe combat isn't anything new, it's basically the exact same as most RPGs. A real-time combat game with abilities, stats, and classes. While it isn't refreshing or new, it is at least somewhat decent.\n\nThe controls on the other hand are absolutely horrible, I keep going in random directions, falling off cliffs, and doing rolls without meaning to.\n\nThe graphics are decent. They aren't spectacular to say, Star Wars: Battlefront 3, or Destiny, but they are similar to World of Warcraft and Runescape's graphics.\n\nThis game is a literal grind-fest. You have to go between Point A and B, but the crafting and gathering system is decent and well put-together.\n\nThe community is very good. It's not amazing, but it's actually somewhat helpful and if you want a good community, this is definitely something you're looking for.\n\nThe story is repetitive and dull, it's incredibly lazy and horribly written.\n\nFinal Verdict: 6/10, Slightly Above Average","April 15","true","42.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I love the idea of city building with friends in an MMO setting. I was so excited to play this game. I mucked throught the first 45 minutes of wandering tutorials and rough quest dialogue with the light at the end of the tunnel of being able to make my own town with my friend. After beating the tutorial boss we were given the quest to begin the main quest line. NO MENTION OF HOW TO CREATE A TOWN. If that is the main focus of the game, instead of giving repetitive quests and gather missions (Which every MMO does) focus on the thing that makes Villagers and Heroes unique, city building sandbox MMORPG. That is what makes this game a fantastic idea; however, the developers fail to capitalize on the fantastic ideas, instead bogging the player down in childish graphics and incoherent quest line. I would be elated to return when the focus is MMORPG sandbox city gameplay as opposed to standard ♥♥♥♥♥♥meplay.","June 3, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

So i saw this game and started playing for a few hours, i saw it had some issues but I thought it had potential. I needed a game to play until wildstar came out at the end of May, so i gave this game a real shot. I REALLY tried to like this game. I even put a fair amount of money into it. This game is definately pay to win. If you dont spend at least 50 bucks upgrading your bags, vault storage, and infiniate travel runes you will not enjoy this game at any stage. Which is fine, I was willing to put up some money to see how its end game was. Bad idea. This game is limited to just running around a few zones at end game. The zone is basically the dungeon in which you have a few bosses to kill. Thats it. Thats the end game. No pvp at all. No real instanced dungeons. Forget about raiding. The zones are also very small when compared with other mmo's. Do yourself a favor and do not try this game out for yourself to see if its any good, I already tried that. Its not.\n\nMy suggestion, if you want an mmo. Is to pre order wildstar. Ive put over 100 hours into it and its AMAZING. Great PVP, hard end game PVE raids/dungeons. Warplots (think guild wars 2 keeps but instead of defending your keep with arrow carts you defend it with missle guided lazer systems and raid bosses).

The best part about the game was it was totally free! There is however a item shop in which you can purchase crowns, the items in the shop are somewhat fairly priced. The questing system is very simple, you basically do as you would in most MMORPG's and collect things for people, and beat up villans, grind, craft ect.. Learning the game is so easy.. like seriously.. so easy, even a 3 year old child could learn this game in less then 20 mins, which i find is rather nice as it lets you dive into the game right away and not waste 4 hours trying to figure out how to craft something. I've played various free to play games, and this is one of the top free to plays if you are looking for something that is simple and enoying. If your looking for something that complicated, detailed this is probably not the game for you.\n\nNow, the good things in this game is that is has guilds, housing, currency system, mail, trading, enchanting, cooking, fishing and the list goes on. The controls are not all that bad, but i would like to see control options for people that like action/combat controls and opposed to turn based controls, i understand this game is semi what turnbased in the way that it works in combat, but i think it should move over to a move of a hack and slash style, as it would feel much more action package.\n\n\nNow for the bad about this game;\n\n-Support is VERY slow to respond, there is currently an issue with their crown system and purchasing, emailed support still no response, been 24 hours, and its not really a big game\n\n- Launcher at the time of this review crashes every 30 mins, i have a feeling there is some type of memory leak thats causing this, there is a walkaround which you can find on their discussion forums, it worked for me and i know longer crash.\n\n- Some of the doors you have to click 5-6 times before they open\n\n- When you click on NPC's to automactically combat them you sometimes get stuck on items in your surroundings like trees and rocks, instead of your character going around the obsticle, your character just gets stuck.\n\n- Auction is DEAD.. no really enough players online to support a good auction house\n\n-UI could really use some work with things like showing your current rank, question direction indicator, better mapping system\n\n-Inventory system is a little lame, could use some work to make it look better, make even make it larger as it seems rather small for a dedicated player\n\n\nWith all that being said, im still rather new into the game, and with updates this review may change, as may my opinion on the game, as it stands right now i would give this game the current ratings\n\nEasability- 10/10\nFun- 8/10\nCommunity- 5/10\nGameplay- 8/10\nUI- 6/10\nItem mall prices- 8/10\nSupport- 5/10\nStability- 8/10\nGraphics- 7.5/10\n\nOverall - 7.5/10\n\n\nI would highly recommend downloading the game and playing it, its free to play and requires nothing but your time.","July 25, 2014","true","66.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

A very good feature in the game is the village where simply...money talks bul!sh!t walks. Everyone would want his settlement to be one of the best in game but this comes to a very large price.

Well lets start off with the clear fact that its a attempted WoW clone  -1. There are 4 of the dullest classes I have seen sence Rune Scape. The enviorment is so plain and flat it's really a joke from when you first enter the game. Zero ability to kite at a archer starting off. Full of cash shop items to make you stronger then anone with out a credit card. Very poor battle feel all together.\nPlain and simple this game is worse then Tiic-Tak-toe. I would recomend forgetting you ever seen this game and move on. They should be ashamed that they released such a poor game.

If you like any of those games you would love this! the music goes with the game, plenty of quests to do, and really hard bosses! Well not that hard, but still they can be pretty hard if you don't level up properly. I like how you get to mine, fish, farm, ect. to make certain stuff. I likethe graphics on this game. Very good community. However, only one person gets the quest if ur beating up a boss with a friend or some random person. It takes probs a minuet or so for the boss to respawn. The two servers i played on were pretty full just be aware of that. You can also pick from 4 different types of classes, knight, archer, priest, or wizard/mage.

(many bad programing errors and feutures that are not polished yet)\n\nI played this game today with my wife for some fun, to enjoy a nice MMORPG. At first look it is great tones of stuff to do, open world style mmo (you dont have to do anything more than the tutorial to do things) and it was quite fun for the first hour.\n\nI encounted many issues, mainly with programing. The game works but there is many "Hacks" in the program, that can and will be exploited if not fixed. (Hack as in a way to program something in, not the right way leaving it open to be exploited, not expecting it to be exploited). It also casues load issues and in some cases can cause system to crash.\n\nThe tutorial needs to be worked on and as it sits it is great, it just does not explain "Everything" as in expecting your players to read your tutorial that is longer than 2 sentences is not going to work. They wont, they want to play and you are only wasteing time putting it there.\n\nFor the remainder of my time I spent it seeing how much you can troll newbs, and there is alot of trollability. Step one grab a auto clicker. Step 2 find a place where a newb is trying to gather stuff. step three point curser at resource. step four activate auto clicker. Then poor newb cant collect there should be a priority system giving priority to the last person that used node (1 - 3 seconds) this can and will stop this main form of trolling that is already going around in your game.\n\nso to Wrap this up\n\nFUN 8/10\nSYSTEMS 5/10 (NEEDS WORK NOT POLISHED)\nSTABILITY 2/10 (MANY HOLES NEEDS PATCHING)\n\nThis game is playable, but not a place you can build a community right now (As that is what the everyday MMORPG gamer wants).","January 28, 2015","false","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Optimisation is kinda crappy, It has 99% usage on core 0 on a 4670k oc @4.1ghz and that is it,\n. Probably requires an ssd but notice it runs choppy as hell in the intro scene and in the game, you might want to turn the distance settings down to about 70% on the sliders for the quality, view and shadows, maybe view a bit further down and lod down a bit also it wasn't maxing my gpu at max settings just it ran more stuttery.\n. Graphics are kinda poo for the character models, well they really do look horrible, graphics overall is okay but not amazing just old.\n. Not sure whether bad or not but pretty much like the next runescape.. When runescape used to be a thing this is now that thing or it should be.\n. Map useless for quest system\n\nGood:\n. Proper Free to play not pay 2 win ♥♥♥♥♥, obviously if you want more bag slots or w/e then that will require actual money but so far its been good doesn't feel pay 2 win at all.\n. Gameplay is like any other mmo in a way but less irritating stupic annoyances of fetch quests than final fantasy a realm reborn. Obviously there will be some to do but not all are and some of them that are help you get stuff you may actually need. no spoilers also not sure i haven't been paying attention to much to it i just click on people with icons and now i have a ton of quests to do\n. Runs on Potato pcs just remember to give your cpu an overclock if its not doing too good.\n. Feels like a next replacement for runescape or it should be the hype that runescape used to be.\n. Graphics do suck but they are clean and the cartoony style is actually ok and makes it bearable to deal with.\n. So far a lot of gameplay for not having paid money.\n. Not a huge download size\n\nSeems worth the time in it so far..

The community are also increadibly nice and it's one of the only MMOs I've played where I never encountered anyone trying to agro anyone.\n\nThere is a uniquely high focus on item gathering and crafting which can be a selling point for some people, but like battle exp it becomes difficult to progress after level 10 without a lot of time put into grinding.\n\nThe music can be very repetetive but is not terrible and there is a nice hand painted texture aesthetic to the world, which is also pretty huge and full of story quests, daily quests and weekly quests to keep you occupied.\n\nHowever the world being so large is also what breaks the game for me. While it is possible to teleport from place to place the items used to teleport you are premium items that are difficult and rare to find in game without buying them as extras, I get that as a free to play game they have to make their money somewhere, but for something so vital to the gameplay it seems like a bad direction.\n\nI would really like to reccomend this game because I did have a lot of fun initially with it, but with the combination of game vital premium items and a steep grinding curve after the first few levels I can't in good faith fully endorse it.\n\nThough it is free to play, so if you want to give it a chance it certainly wont cost you anything to see for yourself whether you can get more out of it than I did.","July 23, 2014","false","14.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A really terrible game! It tries to feel like runescape. (If you've ever played it). Slow Framerate. Even at low settings. Atrociously Bad Combat. *Click* Thats all. Theres no need to use your skills. Buggy Gameplay and it gets even more confusing to manage after you spawn in. Your Presented with 20 different things. Horribly Voiced Characters. Lathargic movement. (Btw way terrible Moving system.) This game is dissapointing at the least. There are alot of word that can be used to describe how bad this game is. As a matter of fact. It had me laughing at how PATHETIC EVERYTHING IS!!!\n\nNothing is special about this game. Its a waste of time. And computer Space. If you wanted better gameplay. Play Wizard101! Yeah thats right! I went there! Incredibly stupid Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe Quests are the worst part! To track it You press "J" to open up your quest journal. and hit track quest. And After you're presented with a HUGE Icon of the Quest's Icon PASTED onn the map. Not only that but the Quests are Ridiculously easy!\n\nHunters are overpowered.And everything else is just... AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGG!!!! TERRIBLE!!!! My short amount of time may have not given the game a chance. I'll take that.\nThe screenshots look nothing like the actual game. Models Arent Smoooooth Like expected. They're Blocky and pixelated.\n\nJust... No more! 1/10.

This game has so many levels so much stuff to do and allot of quests for you to never run out of things to do. I do hate the fact that you have to pay money just so you can get things like mounts, xp bursts, and even just creating packages in your professions. In all fairness this game can relate to World Of Warcraft, Neverwinter, and basically any mmo that has childish graphics and allot of things that this game contains.\n\nOk, so most of the stuff in that review was kind of stupid..but I do recommend you play this game, it's a good mmo to play if you've played mmo's before. The reborn version is great, pretty much still the same game but you know "revised."

What I remember from my experience of playing this game is this. While I enjoyed the content that this game had to offer, or at least the content until the first city where I collect wool to tailor myself a piece of clothing, what I didn't enjoy was the combat system. My combat playstyle is usually hit-and-run and AOE spells. In this game, while I couls successfully execute AOE spells, I wasn't able to 'hit-and-run' since if I moved after I ordered a basic attack but before my character actually executes it, my character never executes it. I'd recommend this game for what it has to offer, but the combat system could benefit from some polishing up.","August 31, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DraggoonPhysz/recommended/263540/","DraggoonPhysz","Draggoon Physz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DraggoonPhysz/","","I played this game a couple of months ago before I wrote this review. What I remember from my experience of playing this game is this. While I enjoyed the content that this game had to offer, or at least the content until the first city where I collect wool to tailor myself a piece of clothing, what I didn't enjoy was the combat system. My combat playstyle is usually hit-and-run and AOE spells. In this game, while I couls successfully execute AOE spells, I wasn't able to 'hit-and-run' since if I moved after I ordered a basic attack but before my character actually executes it, my character never executes it. I'd recommend this game for what it has to offer, but the combat system could benefit from some polishing up.","August 31, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Considering the game was made by a small indie studio the game is rather good. While it is playable and enjoyable there is still a lot of refining that I believe needs to be done.

The crafting gave me hope, but it was shot down when this more interactive process caused the game to crash multiple times.

The battle mechanics seem to be about as basic as humanly possible so if you never wanted a hard battle system this is for you. Lag is what really tends to be a problem. Every 10-15 minutes like clockwork the interactions you have with things will just hang. click a door 4 times and it wont work until the game catches up and summarily opens and closes the door 4 times in front of you. now before people say it could be on my end I also have a high end gaming rig.

This right here, will never be as successful as some of the amazing, detailed, and perfectly optimized games of 2015-2016. In-game graphics are terrible, there is nothing that looks smooth in the entire game. Structures are just thrown together, and placed in random areas. NPC's or Sprites, are so badly made, it's very hard to tell what it's suppose to represent. The quest tracking is by far the lowest in the industry. I could not last any longer than what I did. The music loop is God awful, it makes you want to just try to play in silence. The only thing that I thought was even worth downloading this game for is, when creating a character, you can generate a unique background story. However, that is the only thing these developers have going for them. You can clearly tell this is a low budget game, and that not much time/effort was put into it. It was just released and prayed to get people to pay for bogus items in-game to make "quick bucks". DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO PLAY THIS. Game litterally looks as if a 7 year old child sketched it. Would NEVER play this again, and would NEVER reccomend this game to ANYONE, not even my worst enemy. This game is to cruel to play, and should just be taken down from the Steam Store, and be a lost project.

It is harder when you play alone, but I would still recommend it. I don't like the way the automatic combat system works, but most of the time you are using abilities, so I hardly ever notice. The game also has much gameplay with great crafting, wich can be tedious at times, but still is helpful. There are many places to go, and many, many quests to do, which increase with difficulty the higher level you are. This game also has TONS of gameplay, as long as you work on the quests for xp, which is nice so you don't have to grind. I have at least 35 hours of gameplay or something and I am only level 12 and not even CLOSE to finishing the game or quests, let alone explore all of the areas. There are also many bosses to track down and defeat, which also adds some purpose to the game. Everything eventually leads up to fighting a stone atmy with one of Mallok's apprentices or something, but I am nowhere near the end. I highly recommend this game, especially to play with friends.","December 17, 2014","true","39.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

The key draw of this game, of course, is that it combined WoW-ish gameplay, with UO-ish housing and crafting. Unfortunately, it simply doesn't deliver on either.\n\nThe graphics, to start with, are low quality as they can get. The coding for the game is obviously not optimized, as even on normal settings, I found myself with only 38 - 40 FPS, on a rig  that can run crysis 2 on max settings, and still get 50 FPS, and skyrim, well, we won't even talk about how great the framerate on that is, even with max settings and numerous graphical improvement mods. Graphics, however, are forgivable, if the gameplay is good. Ultima Online stood on this for years, because of the depth of the crafting system, and the housing system.\n\nStability was also an issue, at first. For the first two hours, my game kept constantly, and randomly, crashing to desktop without any notice or erorr messages, every two or three minutes, while I was trying to craft things. My guess? I probably clicked a button too fast, and the game's code took offense at it.\n\nOne thing that this game -does- do well, is that a good chunk of materials can also be gathered by killing monsters, tying the crafting sections in with the combat sections and, if they had imposed some type of skill cap limit, would have made fighters every bit as valuable to a village, as the villagers themselves. Of course, the draw of the game is that you can decide to either be a villager, or adventurer. In truth, you're simply an adventurer that sometimes dapples in villager-lite actions.\n\nI was extremely excited when I finally got the chance to build my own home and enter a village, even so much that I just went to a random, newly-created town, and built it there. I was intrigued at first, that you had to actually stockpile a specific amount of resources at each node, to activate it.\n\nThis quickly turned to disappointment, when I found out that, while you only need to gather 30 - 50 of the resource to stock the node, this stock depleted. Indeed, stocking the node with 30 of an item, seemed to give it 182 charges to gather from, before you'd have to restock the bin again. Which is actually pretty great.\n\nExcept that you cannot restock the bin with resources gathered in that village, and you can only gather from your own village. This basically means that there is no purpose to loading a resource node up with any resources, unless you plan on tripling the resource and then immediately camping it to boost your own investment (Otherwise someone else can just steal it from you), or unless you want to use it to power-level the gathering skills of new players in relative safety.\n\nInstead, you're just simply better off going to a random zone, and gathering at one of the nodes that never disappears. The game also claims that you can only gather so much in a day, due to an energy bar limit, but I did not encounter this at all in four hours of gathering, though it would also be another dermit, if I had.\n\nHousing has to be great, however, right?\n\nWrong. Unlike UO, you cannot enter your house. Instead, the house gives you bonuses to specific parts of your adventurering.. but there's a catch. It costs a lot of gold for even the first bonus. Twenty-thousand gold, to be exact. The other bonuses are even more signifcantly difficult to get, requiring rare items, for very small bonuses. Then there is your little farm plot and animal pen.\n\nMy sheep went to sleep within five minutes, and I couldn't even interact with him for three hours afterwards, so I can't say too much on that process, other than the fact that I couldn't add any more sheep, because my sheep passed out and I couldn't tend to him to increase my skill.\n\nThen there's the farming. In most games, you plant some seeds, you harvest them, you get back at least 2 seeds and some crops. In this game, you plant some seeds, you harvest them, you get one crop per seed planted, which, if you get enough skill, you can re-plant once. With level 4 farming, I couldn't even re-plant the level 1 wheat crop I harvested. In the end, it's another situation of something that seemed like a great idea, but was destroyed by bad design choices.\n\nSo what's the verdict, then? Do you play it, or do you not?\n\nWell, if you're a fan of runescape-ish games, have a lot of free time, and are a farmville fan, this game would probably suit you just fine. The cash shop, at least, isn't completely in your face, and while I could see storage issues (Which are solved by the cash shop, at not too horrible prices, at least) cropping up at later levels of the game, after gathering and hording everything for four hours, I had no problem with it.\n\nIf you're looking for something that lets you decorate a home, really give you ownership of your village, and generally reward you for investing in the village, you'll be sorely disappointed, and I suggest you simply pass this one on.\n\nThe developers, for what it's worth, seem to be fairly active on the steam forums, and seem to genuinely want to make a great game. Perhaps, in the future, they will take feedback and process it. With the right alterations, and the proper polish, this game could easily become a diamond, at this stage, however, it is a decidely rough cut.","April 18, 2014","false","5.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I'm not trolling. So please hear me out.\n\nAccording to the System Requirements listed below, it reads:\n\nOriginally posted by author:RECOMMENDED:\nOS: Windows® 8, 7, Vista, or XP\nProcessor: Intel® Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz, AMD Athlon™ 64 X2 2.6GHz or better\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nGraphics: Graphics card with 512 MB of memory or more\nDirectX: Version 9.0\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nHard Drive: 3 GB available space\nNow, I am using an HP Pavillion dv7 running Windows 7, with 8GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7 Processor, and an ATI Radeon 6770M dedicated video card. In spite of this, Villagers and Heroes struggles to perform on even the lowest graphics settings. Why is this a problem when I am exceeding the system recommendations?\n\nTaking into consideration that I can run other MMOs like Dungeons & Dragons Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic and World of Warcraft at 1600 x 900 with the graphics settings at medium with no problem, there should not be performance issues. But for me, Villagers and Heroes is somehow unplayable.\n\n- even though the game is supposedly running at 20fps, it looks like 1 frame for every 2 seconds\n- Mouse responsiveness is painfully slow\n- game freezes at character creation\n- no sound\n\nUnless you have money to burn, or a monster gaming rig with an nVidia Titan, save yourself the trouble.

Still half decent, not pay to win which is absolutely beautiful.\n\nBut the ♥♥♥♥ing combat HOLY ♥♥♥♥. The combat doesn't seem like an important part of the game initially, but you get thrusted into it just to keep any interesting things in the game.\n\nWhy the combat is ♥♥♥♥\n1. It is click and wait to fire. Terrible lag makes this cringeworthy\n2. Combat levels up like any other skill, but extremely slower than the others. This means the experience ratio compared to say fishing, is way off. Level 1 spot for fishing could get you to about level 10 easy in a bit, getting level 10 in combat takes about 6x that length off level 1 enemies.\n3. The abilities run off of high costs so you can't spam if you're a wizard, so you have to wait to go into another fight.\n\n\nAdvice for combat:\n1. Instead of point>click>wait, have the mouse as an aim and you can fire off of that, in range of course.\n2. Better servers\n3. Change the exp ratios\n\n\nBut this game is good, the combat brings it down to a no.","June 19, 2014","false","16.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The graphics are cartoonish but that is an art choice, yet it requires a powerful computer to run smoothly on high "detail". Now this game is not for combat, it is about the crafting as it is fairly well fleshed out and wasy to understand. Yet the developers found out about this and placed a stopper on crafting, assuming to stop botting but all it has done is harm the actual player. This is due to the ease of creating other accounts who have no restriction on creating potions to remove this blockade put down by the devs.\n\nNext the lag in this game is atrocious there is alot of skipping, getting stuck in objects and being hit by enemies that are no where near you (this is also tied into the "combat" of the game). I did some research and this lag has something to do with the old code from this games facebook days, but this brings up the games combat system, or lack there off. It appears as a turn based combat system at first however it is real time, its just missing all forms of depth and complexity. All you do is spam combat arts and spells with the occasional auto attack and things die, but each attack has an animation and once the animation is begun it is a guaranteed hit unless a dodge is performed. Except no enemy dodges attacks only players.\n\nThis leads to my playthrough being a hammer fest of the number keys and then spamming the z key when it got too much, but that is also down to RNG it appears as i died many times during a roll. Next up is stats of the character, health and spirit restore way to slow. 40 points a minute out of combat is atrocious, this leads to players waiting for a half hour at higher levels waiting doing nothing, there are potions however yet I can only find them in the pay money to the dev section. Death is meaningless, except for the part where you do less damage and take more for 10 minutes meaning you have to wait (or pay the dev).\n\nNow leveling, i was going to beat the game until I spent about 10 hours grinding exp in an area my level only to find my total exp went up 5%. I had to check my numbers but it is about that, the requirements go up exponentially without the gained exp going up a decent amount. So now i have to wait to partake in laggy boring combat that is worth nothing... so glad i can craft oh wait my bot accounts haven't finished. I gave up and went back to EvE online as it is more exciting\n\nSo we have a crafting game that makes you pay to keep crafting or exploit a bottable set of commands, horrid lag, bare bones combat, long waiting between battles and death unless your a healer with a level up system designed by morons. This game needs to be pulled down, decompiled and remade by competent game developers who have some idea how to make interesting combat, better netcode, proper leveling system and better anti bot measures then just breaking the part of the game that is worth a damn.\n\n2/10 Not worth the time really, only play if you have so much time on your hands after watching paint dry for an hour","April 19, 2015","false","39.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

While I give it the thumbs up, I do so with a grain of salt, and a very big grain of salt.\nBut for those of you with TL;DR Syndrom, here is a short summary:  The game has graphics that look bad today, but has a good, nostalgia feel, while also giving a nice digital world look. Its a basic and standard MMO, but lacking in some content specifically, content found in other MMOs.\n\nSo, to begin with, Im into MMOs. Personally, I am interested in a social MMO, with different aspects to play. Namely, housing, PvE-content, socializing among the community, dungeon runs, RP especially like a knight (like, wearing knights armour, sword, shield, horse) and some PvPing. Yes, I'm aware VnH does not have PvP, but more on that later.\nSo, really, once you see the game world, and the store page, you'd think this game is just what I'm looking for, right?\n\nFirst off, the game is pretty entertaining in gameplay. The quests, while the standard, go gather x amount of this, talk to someone, find this, find that, can be rather interesting and entertaining enough. Crafting, while I'm not a big fan of it, plays a major role in you getting the best gear, weapons, etc.\nFurthermore, the community is so friendly that they'd simply all agree to craft you whatever item(s) you need/wanted. So it is possible to rank up your crafts at a relaxing pace.\nClasses: Its the usual class system that we've seen in all the other MMOs before:Heavy armoured, melee damage inflicting warriors, the OPed archers, the annoying healing Priests, and of course the-middle-of-all-the-classes, the wizard, who is a rather interesting class.\nThe game is also not p2w at all. There are ways to get market items for free in drops and your daily Lucky Cards. The gear that takes real money, is simply for looks. It shows it comes with no new moves, attacks, or ratings to suggest buying one would give yourself an advantage in battle.\nStorage is a problem, but it is so much better than other MMOs, especially SWTOR and Eldevin. There are literally, 28 vaults you can rent, 3 more bags, and storage conatiners you can share with your other characters.\nUltimately, without getting to the end of the game, I can tell you who the final boss will be. No darklord, no emperor, no stone lord, no evil wizard, witches, dark knights, or anything. Storage will be the final boss. The game should be called Storage Wars, as given enough time, it'll cause you tons of problems. So storage is a big time problem, but the storage you start out with, as well as the free vault, will give you a great start. The rest is for once you travel deep into the game.\n\n\nSomething I would like to see added to the game:\nMini games. Somethin to do to pass a few minutes, earn a few coins, and maybe play against another player, like checkers, chess, duel etc. The games could be simple like, memory, side-scrolling and other such little things, VnH themed! It'd certainly help the game. I'd even be satisfied with that to count as PvP.\n\nNow, for the negatives. I'll list them, then explain. As you'll clearly see, this game is lacking majorly in some content that has become the standard in MMOs:\n\n1.No mounts.\n\n2. No PvP.\n\nYep thats right. No mounts. Now, it wouldn't be such a big deal to me. I could make do without a horse to ride around on. Majorly dissapointed, yes. But not detrimental to the game.\nNow, why people couldn't raise aniamals to ride around on, like horses for example, it would fit in PERFECTLY with the game setting. Ultimately, the game is split into two halves: 50% deals with farming, gathering, and just being a neighbor.\nThe other 50% deals with setting off on adventure to kill Ai monsters. So, raising a colt to a full grown horse wouldn't just make sense, it would only add to the game's depth, adding to the theme of the community working together to build a world, making it more interesting all around! Even Eldevin, who's mechanics, and graphics are much older than this game, has a VARIETY of mounts as well as also being set in a medieval world.\n\nNext, the PvP. Players love dueling it out on the internet. PvP arenas/ zones/ servers can be found just about anywhere on an online-themed game. So why not here? To keep the the community happy, they say. Well ok, I can try to deal with that. I understand that part. Sadly, it has kept me away from really jumping into the game, wanting to spending money, etc. on it. No pressure Mad Otter. Personally, I think that the lack of PvP is really what has also kept this game from becoming something bigger and being able to compete in the MMO market against the giants of the internet.\n\nFinally we have reached the Big One. Housing. Ok, at character creation (best creation I ever went through on a game!)\nSo at creation, they ask for your house design. They list a few different styles for the outside of your house look. And, once you reach the capital city, right inside, is a guy named Donald. Who is, apparently, in love with the fact that players can own a house. He gives you a quest to go to any village and talk to his sister. The reward: one title to own a house! For free! You must simply choose the when and where! Exciting, isn't it?\n\nSo, after settling down on a spot, I buy my house. First thing you'll see is, that there are DOZENS of outside decoration looks, but they cost real money. No matter though, its just whats on the inside, right?\nLong story short, there is no housing. All that hubbub about how wonderful they are? Apparently being able to have an extra vault, with access to all your storage areas, is something wonderful everyone should have!\nScam of the game, I call it.\nThere is talk they'll add interior housing to the game, but no immediate plans of when and it dont sound like the devs are even working on it as of 11/21/15.\nFinal con: The moderators. Long story short, they're pretty much the refferee of the chat. Sounds good, right?\nWell, apparently, they feel(or have been told) that when there is one or more players who're fighting in chat for whatever, they can threaten and ban, those players from using the chat for a set period of time. Naturally, for veteran players, this would be a serious penalty. For new players, it'd simply drive 'em away from the game. Just my two cents on that matter.\n\nTo wrap it up: I'm still not sure how long term I'm gonna be on this MMO. With the lack of any sort of PvP, mounts, and housing, my interest fades quickly.\nBeyond that, the game is still nice, nostaglic, DEFINITELY NOT p2w. Some of these p2w reviews feel like a free game means no cash shop and when they see one, its "p2w" in their minds. Lol.\nI will at least keep playing off and on, seeing if the game improves. But for how long, I cannot say. If another MMO appears to have just what I want, then most likely, its bye bye Villagers and Heroes.","November 20, 2015","true","83.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't mind the graphics and I can deal with the unoriginal quests, but I couldn't deal with constant lag and the weird character movement. I didn't compare it with major games like World Of Warcraft but I have tried a lot F2P MMO RPG and I can honestly say there are better than this out there.\n\nIt has plenty of professions to lvl up and the skills are obtained by items, the items you craft and combine. This is a good twist on the lvl up to obtain the new skill model. The talent tree lacks a bit though, not much to do there. The combat is the basic shortcut but....less. The skill "manifestation" is lacking to a point that auto-attack might be more desirable to the eye.\n\nThis might happened to me only (maybe my screen settings) but at night (in game) it was too dark. Raising the brightness (in game) distorted the colors of the brighted places and raising the brightness of my monitor was blinding me when the day came. Maybe they wanted to give the real night impression like some other games to prevent to hunt at night easily but waiting for the sun to come up was adding to the lack of interest.\n\nI didn't play much so I cannot say about end game or even how it progresses, but it is a game that couldn't make me wanna hit the launch button again.  I do not hate it, it was not bad, but I didn't like it either.

Once you hit level 16 in any crafting skill there will be a brick wall that blocks your progression. This is valled "Vim." It's like stamina or energy.

The gathering/crafting system talked up for this game is very generic as well; the steps are get tool, click object, wait a second, get item, go to crafting bench, combine two items, get end product. There's no game to it, it's just another grinding simulation, like Farmville. The character models look goofy but without any kind of cartoony charm, instead just looking stiff and strange like a Sim gone wrong, with too much chin and a weird dead-eyed expression. And it's a quest based game, which guarantees you'll be grinding from start to finish; "bring me 10 spider silks and I'll let you progress". The combat system is as generic as you get; click the enemy, right click to auto attack, and number keys for skills. As for technical issues, the game would not recognize my USB headphones and would only play through the laptop speakers, and I had to install the game three times because two of those times it crashed Steam and didn't show up in my games list.\n\nIn short, this is not one of the better f2p MMO's available and I do not reccommend it.","August 2, 2014","false","1.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Im not going to talk about the ugly graphics or the bugs and glitches that sometime can be very annoying, or the server lag, that even in a half empty EU server can be an issue. Im going to talk about the bad game design:  There is no looting system, yeah right, NO LOOTING SYSTEM, party loot is ALWAYS FREE FOR ALL, imagine how that can work well in a mmorpg. Quests are the worst designed quests I ever seen, and I did play a lot of games. Tedious as hell, and often barely give you hints about what to do. Crafting looks deep at first, but it is quite boring and a very huge money sink, and the ton of different crafting mats will fill up your storage very fast, forcing you to buy space with real money, or throw stuff away. Spirit regeneration, mana-like power bar that is used by all classes (4) to use skills, is a big pain in the butt, you are probably meant to craft huge stacks of potions, because there is no food or /sit option to bring that regen up. You just stand around watching it ticking up veeery slowly all 3-4 mobs. Someone said it gets better when you level up but no idea how much better it would be. I really wanted to try it for the crafting that looked interesting, but as I seen that leveling it up burns tons of money, making you probably have to grind money for that, I stopped trying.","October 13, 2014","false","68.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harmstotheway/recommended/263540/","Harmstotheway","Harmsway","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harmstotheway/","64 products in account","I have played a lot of games, and I mean a lot. Mostly MMO's in fact. I have never seen\n\none so undiverse,  with no depth, and riddled with bugs as this one.\n\n\nTo start off, you are placed in some Hollow place, where you have to kill wolves\n\nfor a lady (which might I add may be difficult), this is the start of a almost 1 1/2 hour\n\ntutorial where you do unuseful things, such as gather wood, just so you can walk over five\n\nfeet and make a bow that you proceed to take to some guy and he gives you a better one,\n\nthus making the bow you spend ten minutes on useless. You can learn to cook, or brew\n\nalcoholic beverages, by shaking a tree and a few button clicks. The tutorial is long,\n\nbasic, uninteresting a crueling and teaches you absolutely nothing useful about the actual\n\ngame.\n\n\nLet's talk a little more about the crafting. While the crafting is much like Guild\n\nWars 2's "Click, UI pops up, click on what you want, some time passes, item pops out" it\n\nis actually very immersive in the fact that your crafting is nearly unlimited. It goes to\n\na very high point and you can basically craft any weapon, armor or anything else you want\n\nif you have the materials\n\n\nCharacters. This just makes me angry beyond all recognition. It should make you\n\nangry . A priest, hunter, warrior and mage. REALLY. You couldn't have at least tried to\n\ncome up with one ORIGINAL class. It's really not that hard. Just make a hunter with a\n\nspecial twist, but NOOOOOOO, no originality in this game. There is nothing original about\n\nany of the classes, they do the same thing that they do in every game. To add to the\n\nunoriginal characters, they have their own "Talents" where you put your points when you\n\nlevel up. There is only around 12 places to actually put your talent points. Then you just\n\nkeep putting them into the same ones, "upgrading" the talent.\n\n\nWhile the talents are not abundent, the skills are. Woodcutting, Plant lore, and\n\nfishing are just a couple. They all have unique perks and as you level up you get\n\n"Achievements" which gies you some in game money to spend. This is useful not only from a\n\nmoney standpoint, but also from a resource standpoint, you don't just grind mobs for\n\nmoney. Sadly, the fish are just recolors of another fish for the most part.\n\n\nCombat. Combat is a copy paste of WoW, just like the rest of this game. You click,\n\nand your character auto-attacks, you can use your 1-0 keys to aid with your various skills\n\nthat unlock over time. Combat is nothing special, and pretty bland. Once you kill an\n\nenemy, your loot flys fifty feet into the air and spews all over the place. Annoying. And\n\nif you help someone kill another monster, and you aren't in the same party, then you might\n\nnot get the loot. To top it all off, all the quests are "Go kill X amount of _____ animal.\n\nCome back to me when you did it." it's just a "grind" to the death.\n\n\nLet's talk about graphics & UI. The graphics aren't that great, after all this is\n\n2014. THis game honestly looks like the old Spyro games. I went to add my friend to the\n\nfriends list (if they had one, I didn't know if they did). I searched the menu until I\n\nfound the friends list, only to find that there is no search. You have to go and FIND your\n\nfriend in order to add them. When you find them they have to hold still so you can\n\n"inspect" them and then move to the top of the screen to add them. It's a bother.\n\n\nQuests. I have gone briefly over quests in the tutorial section of this segment,\n\nBUT let me elaborate. The main questline is hardly thrown together. Side quests are\n\nrepetitive, and even some of them DON'T EVEN WORK. You can't comeplete some of the quests.\n\nNot once have I ever seen an MMO where you can't complete a quest. Sometimes you can't\n\neven talk to the person who gave you the quest in the first place.\n\n\nGlitches. They are like your BFF in this game. There are too many. Everywhere you\n\nlook you may get stuck in a building or fall through the map or something else that should\n\nnot happen. As previously mentioned you might not be able to speak to the person you need\n\nto either.\n\n\nMap. The map is not open, it's just a bunch of miniscule, pre-defined maps, with\n\npre-defined spawns. In order to go to another part of the world you go to some teleporter\n\nthat isn't explained at all and is kind of just there. It's not open or free at all. You\n\nfeel confined to a small space in every map.\n\n\nCliche. There is a central city with all the merchants and teleporters to a whole\n\nbunch of different parts of the map. That is so cliche of MMO's I can't describe how angry\n\nthat makes me. With the teleporters there is also lag as it genereates, so that is\n\nuseless.\n\n\nNow let's take a nice little look at my personal ratings of this game.\n\n\nGraphics- 2.5, welcome to the 1990's where there were no graphics but boxes. Oh, and fake\n\nlooking huts.\n\nStory- 3, Thrown together by a three year old, I see no connections whatsoever to each\n\ncharacter you go to other than where they live\n\nGameplay- 1, This game is so broken it is no fun to play\n\nMechanics- 3, It is playable, but it looks as if it should not be released, almost like it\n\nis early ALPHA. The controls are clunky and finicky.\n\nReplay Value- 0, don't even bother to play it.\n\nSoundtrack- 9, THE ONE THING THAT IS GOOD!! They have a nice soundtrack, suits the towns.\n\nOverall: 3, This game isn't worth the time. It was so terrible I couldn't bear to play it\n\nthe full 5 hours I promise to do before a review.

I concur with many about the crafting system having plenty of depth, though you should probably get some more inventory slots in order to get the most out of it. I have only played the Swift Warrior class so far, which didn't get very high level wise because I was out leveling my crafting and gathering skills. And man, did I enjoy fishing. My only complaint in the four hours of gameplay is that crafting/gathering items from skill use are automatically picked up but players have to manually pick up items gathered from killing monsters, and these items can fall in areas no seen by players.

The combat system is also slow and not very fluent, if you move at all, hit a skill by accident or practically do anything while auto attacking, you will completely stop what your doing and the abilities you tried to use will go on cooldown. I can't see how that is viable at any point in the game.\n\nOkay then, I get it. The game is called VILLAGERS and heroes, maybe the crafting and exploration part of the game was what it was all about.. but that was not the case. Finding the materials is very easy and when you go to craft items, the game basically does everything for you. You can walk several feet in a village, gather the items needed to cook/fish/shear/whatever and then go back to the area, pick what you want to make and then sit back and watch your guy do every for you. How is that fun? I was hoping a minigame or something interesting to do while cooking or say you had to hammer weapons or armour at a blacksmith? wouldn't that be more fun than watching your pixels stir a pot of apples?\n\nSo at this point in the game, the combat is sluggish and outdated, the movement is awkward, the quests and zones are way to linear and the crafting/socialization of the game is completely simple and dead. I really don't understand what the appeal is.\n\nA and D turning should of been improved, and when you look at players moving, they tend to slide due to sluggish movement design. I've asked several people in game and they feel the same way.\n\nAnd why are the quest givers speaking in atleast 3 different languages when I am set to english?\nI understand its in beta, but I fail to understand why i'm being spoken to in english, russian and german.\n\nThis game is still in its early beta, so these things could be fixed and upgraded before it is fully released, but its really hard to endure even an hour of this when you have experienced quality games like World of Warcraft and other MMO's.\n\n(Thats not to say its complete garbage, as the forementioned games are subscription based and have time behind their backs to master the this subject of gaming.)\n\nThe small player base, having only several players in any given area, makes the chat dead and empty, accept for the occasional moderator snooping around, dropping filter hammers on your head.\nOn that note, I said "crap" in chat, and I was told to not use curse words or I should leave the game. Clearly, this game is highly censored, which is a huge turn off for me.\n\nI do however, like the art design very much, a nice casual blend of sharp detail and a nice mesh of colours makes it looks very pretty.\n\nCharacter design is very primitive and the players look very ugly. But thats not important.\n\nWhat is important, is the store. It has a large selection of cosmetic items, gag items and unfortunetly has Pay 2 Win, making this dead to me the minute I logged on. (combat potions. bro, those are pay to win)\n\nAll in all, its just another cheap MMO. Give it a go if your looking for a free game to play or just casually sit around with friends, but don't expect anything special.\n\nI also find it odd how recommended reviews are always highly rated up, even when there is no content. It's almost like people can't stand having this substandard game rated down.\n\nAnyway, they tried, they failed horribly and now this is another sad pimple on the face of MMO history. Enjoy :P\n\nPersonal Rating: 1.5/5","April 21, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
