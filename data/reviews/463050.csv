Very satanic / metal looking.\n+ The ambient sounds add a lot to this gloomy game, it makes you on edge like a horror game although not much is actually going on.\n\n- The gameplay itself is pretty awful and often confusing with no sense of direction or what you are supposed to be doing. Most of the game you are expected to just pace around until at some random point the game decides to advance without you doing much of anything.\n- The old English Edger Allen Poe style of writing can be a bit difficult for some to read and understand\n- Not a whole lot to do or explore, you mainly just rot inside a cell and read through the thoughts of a man on death row waiting for his death sentence.\n\n~ To be honest, this game would likely have been better suited as a visual novel.","May 19","false","9.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

I, of course, appreciate the effort (this game get closer to the novel than Roger Corman's movie) but... No.","May 17","false","0.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"
