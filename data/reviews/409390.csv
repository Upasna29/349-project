It took me around 3 hours to get gold on all 20 levels. Do not expect an ultra hard precision marble platformer like in Marble Blast Ultra or similar games. The gameplay is almost relaxing and without the typical marble game frustration, though there are a few tricky parts.\n\nThere are also some differences from other marble games:\n\n- Camera movement is scripted. This generally works well since you can almost always see where you're going without having to manuever it yourself.\n- Marble moves slower and with better control than some other games (much slower than Marble Blast, better control than Marble Madness). Even going downhill the ball can slow if you stop pushing it.\n- No jumping.\n- Marble breaks if you fall from too high, and sometimes when hitting a wall too fast.\n\nBasically, if you like roll-a-ball games or Marble Madness/Super Monkey Ball clones, but wish they were less frustrating, this game is for you.\n\nHaven't tried it with VR support yet so I can't comment on that, but may update this when my Rift arrives in a month or two.\n\nFinally, was initially unable to play the game due to it crashing Steam on startup, but developers were responsive in getting it fixed. Solution was to hold left alt on launch to bring up the configuration menu, after which I've been able to start it fine.","April 6","true","5.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","3"

The camera changes work very well with the gameplay, not at all interfering or annoying. The difficulty increase with each level certainly tests your manouvering skills, and the geography for each level is well designed and planned out. The marble is adorable with his hat. Ahh aurums.. gotta catch 'em all! :D Well done, Lightning Rock!","April 6","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Only issue is there is a fair bit of discomfort with this title, not sure if it's the speed of the computer controlled camera or another factor. Maybe a bit of camera smoothing would help, or less severe transitions?","April 14","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Specifically when the camera angle is changing and you are moving your head looking around at the same time. Perhaps instant cuts would be better than sweeping angle changes?\n\nWould not recommend until they fix this.","May 14","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As the camera angles change so does how the movement buttons affect the marble. It is terribly balanced, the camera will change to an angle which will suddenly make everything much harder, the controls are also bad. The marble tends to slide all over and you do not possess nearly as much control of it as you would like, its also nearly impossible to go in a straight direction once the camera changes. I would not recmoned this game and actually regret buying it.","April 9","false","0.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Nothing annoys me more than when you can't actually control the camera in a game where the camera angle is everything to this game. Altogether the game is really fun, but the devs really need to add in Controlling for the camera to really help the game be better.","April 9","false","1.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I've been loving my Vive and VR in general for a little over a week.  Roomscale is amazing and the games that utilize it have been awesome.  However I still yearn for some good sit down games in VR.  Let's face it, with all the current popular roomscale games out there you can only play them for so long in one go before you get physically tired.  Marble Mountain has helped fill that yearning for sit down VR goodness.  The game isn't that difficult, but it definitely delivered a fun, enjoyable, and memorable experience.  It brought me back to my NES days playing Marble Madness but on a whole new level.  Props to the devs for their hard work and also I loved the tribute song in the ending credits :).\n\nBottom line in my opinion: It's a good solid game worth picking up.  It's only about 3 hours long, but still worth the $10.","April 24","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes, I am tired and don\'t want to dance around shooting arrows or blocking laser beams.  This game is aesthetically pleasing and relaxing.  Playing in VR is like sticking your head in a little diaorama.  I can see how some might get queasy playing, but I just get that pleasant feeling like riding a roller coaster where your stomach feels like it\'s floating.  The puzzles so far have been pretty simple, but entertaining and the controls are pretty fair except for the ball seems to drift oddly when controller is at rest.  Only wish there were more levels and possibly rolling using the motion controller as a balance controller.","May 31","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
