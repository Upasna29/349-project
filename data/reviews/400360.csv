I can't really imagine why anyone would commission an entire remake of an episodic game series that certainly didn't set the world on fire upon its initial release. I will admit I am a bit of sucker when it comes to games like this set around some historical context. While many take liberties (some to the extreme) with history, painting in incredibly broad brush strokes games like Indiana Jones and The Emperors Tomb, the Uncharted series, Lara Crofts thrilling Tomb Raiding adventures and the adventure game series Broken Sword have nonetheless entertained me thoroughly through the years. With the recent surge in adventure titles like Uncharted and Tomb Raider gaining traction once again with the modern gamer, to publisher Soedesco, this probably looked like the perfect title to ride on the coat-tails of the giants mentioned above but Adam's Venture Origins is no Tomb Raider/ Uncharted/ Broken Sword despite its attempt at taking elements from all three games and trying to mash them up into one wholly original game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=676679983\nFrom a storytelling perspective -  Adam's Venture Origins biblical subtext is layered on so thick you would have to be a doofus to not have any of it register as you set about searching for the Garden of Eden with your trusty sidekick Evelyn Appleby. Yes Adam and Eve have joined forces to outsmart an evil corporation known as the Clairvaux company, who for dubious reasons seem intent on taking over the world. While I certainly don't mind all the biblical references, subtlety and intelligence is not one of Adam's Venture Origins strong suits and these references often feel like anvils dropping from the sky onto the players head. It all becomes a bit too much to bear thanks to incredibly dull gameplay that involves a whole lot of puzzle solving, a bit of tomb raiding and some seriously lackluster action sequences. Sadly Adam's Venture Origins end up nailing neither one of them. It doesn't help that the main protagonist, Adam, talks and sounds like the village idiot. In fact the voice overs throughout the entire game are consistently weak and the dialogue so trite and full to the brim with bad puns and jokes that are about as old and musty as the tombs and cities these two protagonists are required to explore in order to piece together the adventure. For the most part it is truly cringe worthy. Just wait until the underwhelming and underwritten villain finally shows up. It will literally have you scratching your head going WTF?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658469625\nAdam's Venture Origins may look good in screenshots and you may end up being somewhat convinced, like I was, that this could end up being a a decent mid-tier adventure title but sadly that is not the case. While the game can look striking , the animations are incredibly janky and not all of the game mechanics work together in unison to offer a fluid experience. Now I know that the game does not have the publishing might of a Square Enix or Sony behind it nor the technical prowess of a Naughty Dog or Crystal Dynamix creating magic out of all the bits and bytes but sadly the entire game feels so cheaply made and cobbled together. If ever there was cash-grab masquerading as potential breakout hit then this is it. Even the puzzles the game presents the player with are all pretty much of the same variation and are used countless times over during the entirety of the game. A bit more variety would have gone a long way especially since Adam's Venture ends up becoming quite puzzle heavy.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=676590788\nWhile I had my moments where I was semi-enjoying the game there was a lot of times during my playthrough where I thought to myself why am I putting myself through this sub-par ordeal when I can install Tomb Raider or any of the Broken Sword titles and get a far more fluid, better crafted and entertaining gaming experience. With a store price that is quite steep, some terribly musty and cringe worthy storytelling with some seriously idiotic written dialogue and the "neither-here-nor-there" gameplay on offer I can't really see who this remake was intended for. If you fell for the whole Tomb Raider/Uncharted/Broken Sword vibe while watching the trailer - take heed! Adam's Venture is nothing like any of them since what you end up with here is a cheaply made wannabe knock-off that is as dull as dirty dishwater to slog through.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 21","false","13.5"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","41","43","0","2"

Right now, NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n* EDIT, After miracle performance improvements. 4/21/2016*\n\nOne week later after my first words about the game i must confess the game is way better now, the game runs fluent, no FPS drops, just minos technical issues that are not game changers (graphic glitches or such stuff), and i have actually started having fun playnig the game, it seems like Indiana Jones went to a bar and founs Lara and they went updstaiers to mate, and 9 months after Adam was born.\n\nAbout the game, you must complete puzzles, many are easy, just a few may need more time, mechanics are simple, do puzzles, jump, look for pieces of stuff to open doors, use the graple and such, plays better with controller, dialogs are fun too. Adam is such a spoiled brat lol.\n\nThe game is very entertained and i must say i am glad they have fixed errors and things that made it terrible in the beginning, now i am changing the game to RECOMMEND. :)\n\nGraphics   7.5\nStory        7.5\nSounds     8\ngameplay  8.5\nVoices:     8","April 7","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Where do I sign up?! Count me in!\n\nAdam's Venture is a 3D third person puzzle adventure, set in the roaring 1920's. It's basically a remake / reimagining of the original, three-game, Adam's Venture series that was originally released between 2009 and 2012. In Adam's Venture Origins, you control the actions of our hero, Adam who, together with a female companion named Evelyn, will have to thwart the evil plans of the shadowy Clairveaux company.\n\nI've never played the original Adam's venture games, so this was actually my first experience with the Adam's Venture Franchise. I must say, I really think it turned out to be a great game! The controls are simple yet effective and the game has a nice overall look to it. Combine this with a nice soundtrack and this game is really one you want to play if you like games like the Secret Files series or something similar.\n\nYou'll begin your adventure in your father's study, who is in need of a certain book for his studies. He has sent his new assistant to collect it, but she hasn't returned just yet. At this point, your father grows impatient and sends you to find her and the book. You set off to do just that and that's how you meet Evelyn; a nice girl who will help you during your adventures (or criticize you from time to time). Adam's Venture has a nice story that takes you to all kind of cool and mysterious locations. When Adam is exploring an area, he can use his grapple hook to get around. It's a nice addition to the game and works really well.\n\nAdam's Venture Origins features a lot of cool environments and surprising events. And although I don't want to spoil anything for the people who haven't played the game yet, I cannot help but to tell you about one really cool point in the story. It occurred right after I found a certain book in a library. I went back to study and Adam's father and Evelyn are examining the book. I was able to take it from them and then I use it to open a secret panel. When I entered the newly discovered passageway, I fell into a tomb that was hidden underneath the house. You never see that happening at your own house, do you?\n\nOur protagonist, Adam, is kind of an anti-hero; He is a bit cocky, but kind and often uses some cheesy one-liners. Like when you come across a globe and you're able to spin it round. If you interact with it, Adam actually says: Adam Venture, makes the world goes round. I just love that! The developers focused on difficult puzzles for you to solve. Now, don't get anxious and start crying or something. You will eventually get the hang of it, I promise. The puzzles are intricate and solving them will really demand a lot of thinking on your part, but with some logic and by occasionally racking my brains, I was able to solve them. Adam's Venture is literally filled with puzzles and every time you solve one, you'll feel incredible!\n\nI would just like to say that I had a great time playing Adam's Venture Origins! it's a great game for everyone who likes adventure and/or puzzle games. Because there's next to no violence in it, it's also appropriate for children (PEGI 7). So if you feel like using your brain and have a great adventure, Adam's Venture Origins is one title you will not want to miss.\n\nLike this review?

I will not spoil to much of the story but it's intriguing and quite entertaining. The game also has my kind of humor, with some funny one liners. The story does not have branches, and therefor the game is quite linear. But I think the developer intended to tell a specific story with this game.\n\nThe "Adam's Venture: Origins" game has a bit of Indiana Jones feeling about it. Searching through caves, solving puzzles and visiting far away places. Also it reminded me of other interesting adventure games, like Dreamfall and Syberia. The music and sound design is really atmospheric. The game also looks gorgeous for an adventure game. I didn't get stuck on any puzzle, but some of them took some time to figure out. Adam has a new option for gameplay in this game: he has a grappling hook which can be used for traversing and solving puzzles.\n\nThe game isn't really long, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really like the fact that it didn't have much backtracking to just stretch the length of the game. If you are an adventure gamer, enjoy puzzles and some funny jokes, you will find this quite an interesting game.","April 17","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As I know the original game was not a huge hit as well, but this Origins pulls out the few elements that made Adam's Venture a little bit above the avarage mass of games.\n\nFirst, the story is full of clichés, it steals from Indiana Jones to Tomb Raider. But in reality, this title is just a counterpart of a B movie of the weaker kind.\n\nThe gameplay is boring as well. It makes you repeat lot of similar puzzles which are interesting in the first two hours but lose its sense in the remaining parts of the game.\n\nFurthermore, Adam's Venture: Origins has several gameplay elements which are rather mistakes than new features. Take the most annoying part, the hook and the climbing. It'll make you very angry when you can't reach a height after 2-3 minutes long swinging. And it is funny that if you lower the quality, you can do the swinging immediately. This is so 90s. But the first Tomb Raider in 1996 performed much better in this feature too. And I swear Lara Croft's motion and acrobatic skills were much more professional back then than Adam's in 2016.\n\nTherefore I think you should not buy this game. It is a waste of time and especially a waste of money. If you want to play an adventure / platformer / puzzle game, the Tomb Raider series are still your best choice.","April 20","false","11.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
