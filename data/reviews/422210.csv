They dropped the price big time and I can't recommend you buy the alpha hard enough!\n\nSo for those of you just getting here, the game was priced at about 20 dollars give or take for the current level of content, which was waaaaay higher than what the game was worth at the time of writing the review, but through a splash of humanity the team has dropped the price point to a much more acceptable level! See, sometimes all it takes is a bit of voice and see where it goes folks, I owe the dev team a lot of thanks for being willing to work with the community on a proper price and I'll be damned if I'm not willing to tell everyone to come get a copy!\n\n\n\nAt the typing of this review the game only has one hero to play as and one "technical" map to test on where you singlehandedly must harvest resources, build turrets, and hope for the best. Part of it feels like a splash of a MOBA waiting to happen and the other part of it feels like a Tower Defense; these are fine as the game kinda sells itself as such. You settle down on the map, you harvest resources, can build a turret or a warehouse with functional laborers, and then you defend a crystal.... the only problem at this point is the huge lack of stuff to do. I mean sure I chopped down half a forest and mined some stone, but the enemies move so slow and so do you. Turrets mow down baddies and can be upgraded and I'd be damned if not for my warehouse workers going into the field for me and harvesting resources. Edit:  For roughly 5 dollars the previous explanation for the game should be taken in a much lighter and supportive tone. For what is in the game at the moment and knowing the future of the game, 5 dollars is more than enough for the experience I received.\n\n\n\nA few things the devs need to think about doing for the sake of their game's success: [/i]\n\n1. Edit: Scratch that first complaint, the game price has been reduced to something completely manageable and far more acceptable than what I was expecting!\n\n2. Focus more on economy aid. My Warehouse was my baby, which is why I built seven more! Suddenly I didn't have to waste all my time and could just go out exploring. Let me upgrade that Warehouse, maybe add in buildings that specialize in collection instead of one major building like logging camps and quarries. Add lesser turrets to those in an upgrade so I can leave them alone for a bit at a time instead of making huge investments.\n\n3. Go a step further while your game is already still in it's infant stages; might be smarter to take the hero role to a new level and introduce customizated characters instead of picking from a list. We have one hero right now and two others on the way, but why do it like everyone else? Introduce a hero creator, add parts and components, weapon ideas, ability choices, etc. Take a step in a new direction that so few other games like this one have gone and really stand out infront of the competition!\n\nDon't think little of this game folks, it's a beautiful game with pretty great graphics and an interesting future ahead of it. Make sure you're rooting for these devs because in six months we'll probably have a gem here.","December 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keenzor/recommended/422210/","keenzor","Keen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keenzor/","958 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATE 10.12.2015: The new price is much more reasonable, while my points about the state of game remain same, if you are intrigued by the gameplay as I was it is not that of a pick up with the current price.\n\nWith the basic workings of the game let me move on to the technical state of the game. To begin with and to remain on a positive way let me mention the visual part of the game. Menu of the Rise of Keepers reminds me of Dota 2 and promises a lot, at this point though, most of the options are "greyed out" and one can only try the single player mode in which one gets to choose from four different difficulties which differ in the number of incoming waves and the time one has between each wave. Discouraging may be the absence of the settings menu (Unity?) which is accessible only upon the start of the game from desktop and lets player change resolution, graphics fidelity (no separate options for different settings), select the monitor he wants to display the game on and to change input keys.\n\nThe visual quality of the game itself is pretty decent. The textutres look actually pretty great and from the aesthetic standpoint the Rise of Keepers looks pretty fantastic, that is, until something moves. The animations need a lot of work to match the overal visual quality of the game at its current state.\n\nI do keep repeating "at its current state" a lot, don't I? Well, as I have stressed out at the beginning of this review, this is a very, very, VERY early alpha release and as such suffers from lack of content and technical problems. While the game did not crash once during the time I have played, my FPS were going unjustifiably wild considering the graphical fidelity of the game as well as my hardware. Average of 25 fps with drops below 15 with more units spawned on i5 and 660ti with the way the game looks is not acceptable even with best quality options on fHD. On later stages, with more units spawned, the game also suffers from an input lag (in singleplayer!) at the worst it took from 5-10 seconds for the game to register my mouse clicks making the game basically unplayable. If the developers manage to fix these problems the Rise of Keepers will be a much more pleasureable experience; However that won't be the end of developers work.\n\nWhat I would like to see possibly in the next update apart from the technical fixes is an improved interface, possibility of seeing the stats of the enemies on click and tooltips in the inventory. If I was the developer of Rise of Keepers I would focus on fixing the technical issues and improving the interface first and foremost before releasing the new content. Multiplayer and more Keepers would be great but at this point what the game needs more is fixing and improving not expanding. I would also suggest to hire some native English speakers to proof read or even write the texts and to do the voice acting, possibly with at least some higher quality microphone if you cannot afford a studio. You might also want to ask the youtube community to do that for you in exchange for a free copy of the game and mention in the credits. You probably won't get any of the big names; However anyone with a decent setup and native speaker level would probably do better than the current voice actors (sorry guys, don't take it personally).\n\nTo sum this up, is the game currently worth the asked price? Hell no. Will it ever be? Possibly; However the devs really need to work their butts out since this is just the beginning and they have looooong way to go. I would recommend buying this only if you really want to support the devs and are willing to risk that the game might end up unfinished considering how much work is left to be done here. Playing at this point is really just alpha testing and I would suggest to wait for the later versions.\n\nI will be updating this review in the future to reflect the development of the game.","December 6, 2015","true","4.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

Texture and models are also at decent quality at this moment.\n\nAs for sounds ambiente are good, music is great fantasy/medieval but, major dislike is awful voice-acting, It starts to be annoying from first minute.\n\nGameplay as I wrote above is impressively promissing, It's like having 4 games in one. As game store says it's single player game, no it's not, there will be multiplayer added at some point, and thats not all, you can play both PVP and PVE.\nGame runs stable, doesent crash, or have some major lags even now in alpha stage.\nI would lie if I say Im not hyped about this game, I am.  Imagine playing moba with tower deffence, in pause of waves playing it as RPG grinding, farming and collecting materials and equipment, then strategy building all variety of buildings.\nGame right now do not offer very much content, and you may get borred after few hours of playing.\n\n\nOverall;\nThis game have massive potentional to be one of Steam favorites, if developers do their thing to the end.\n5 bucks is fair money to get involved and support developers, therefore I recommend it!\n\nDisclaimer:\nKey was provided by developer for testing/reviewing purpose.","December 6, 2015","true","7.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

Rise and defend it at any cost against the onslaught of the enemy’s waves. Now….. do what you have to do to keep it safe. Keeper!\n\nRise of Keepers is a Tower defence/RPG game type of game where you have to defend your base (the blue Crystal) against waves of enemies. At the start of the game (single player), you will be able to choose what type of difficulty you would like to play. You have 4 in total from Easy to Survival. The difference is the number of enemy waves you have to dispose of. Easy has 8 waves in total with 15 minutes interval between them, where the hard one has 25 waves with 5 minutes interval between them.  For survival, you will play until you die and you have 5 minutes interval between the waves too!\n\nBetween the waves, you will have to gather resources to build your defences; chopping trees and picking large rocks will be your main prerogative at the start. You can build warehouses, each of which will give you an additional 2 workers and they will help you drastically with gathering the well- need resources.  Then you will be able to explore this huge map and come across animals you can hunt easily and some who we shall consider dangerous…. A bear for example! Foxes, deer and wild boars will give you experience points and food when you kill them (and they do not fight back, they run away).  As you explore the map you will find treasures which will be very helpful to your keeper.\n\nTo upgrade your base not only will you need to have enough resources but your keeper will need to have reached his next level experience to be able to do so. When upgraded, you can upgrade your towers, choose to level up your keeper attribute, but the most important is that your base gets additional points - more points you have the harder it is to destroy.\n\nFrom the keeper’s point of view, at this stage you will be able to play with only one keeper but based on what I can see, you will have up to 27 keepers on the final version to play with. 9 keepers with strength attribute, 9 keepers with agility and 9 keepers with intelligence.\n\nThe designers have put a “Road Map” in the options which tells you when and what upgrade will come through.\n\nOn the final version, PvE & PvP multiplayer modes will be available. This game is well presented and enjoyable to play for an early access but it needs more content, in my opinion.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good concept\n-	Nice graphics\n-	4 levels of difficulty\n-	Single and multiplayer modes (final version)\n-	Good price point\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Needs more content\n-	No achievements / trading cards\n\nRise of Keepers is an early access at this stage but has got GREAT potential and you can pick it up at a bargain price.\n\nThis is one of the games I will keep a very close eye on!\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE\n","December 13, 2015","true","6.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"
