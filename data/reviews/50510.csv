"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/50510/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Everybody loves killing zombies. Whether it’s in the first person like Left 4 Dead, third person a la Resident Evil, or top down as with Burn Zombie Burn! there’s something about their mass pack mentality that ensures a massive smile whenever your baseball bat meets their heads. Perhaps it’s because we don’t see these poor, brainless drones as humans or whether it’s just a simple survival instinct kicking in because we’re often surrounded by dozens of them at once.\n\nIt’s this mass horde attitude that plays off so well with Burn Zombie Burn! as your character, Bruce, is constantly outnumbered by more of the undead than we’ve ever seen in a videogame. Not only that but the basic AI employed by these zombies is actually more scary than if they actually had anything other than a lemming-like “follow follow”, especially when the screen is filled with a hundred of the little buggers. It might seen like an oxymoron, but the dumber zombies are the better the game. I’ll tell you why.\n\nBurn Zombie Burn! isn’t just about dispatching these sad but aggressive beings with clips full of bullets: it’s cunningly technical and whilst yes you’ll manage to get through the game bluffing it, for the high scores and the in the zone feeling that you’re playing it the way it’s meant to be played you’ll need deft dexterity and the ability to quickly think on your feet. It’s all about the combos and the clever, titular Burn! mechanic.\n\nSimply put, dead zombies drop pickups. These pickups can be significantly more powerful if said zombies were burnt alive instead of just shot, sliced or beaten – Bruce can switch between whatever main weapon he has (be that a shotgun, a baseball bat or a submachine gun, for example) and his trusty stick of burning wood. Touch a zombie with your torch out, so to speak, and they’ll instantly ignite, and any neighbouring undead will also begin to burn, like a particular nasty virus.\n\nOnce alight the pickings become richer, leading to TNT and other massively destructive items that can hugely influence your eventual score. Burning zombies, however, are faster and more deadlier and thus the game instinctively requires you to manage the danger levels against the possible rewards. Other mechanics come into play, such as specific weapon combos requiring you to not swap out your gun should you run out of ammo, and these all run in parallel with each other transferring an otherwise basic set of game rules into something much more complex.\n\nThis doesn’t ever get in the way of the action, though, which is relentless. Throughout the game’s modes the zombies come thick and fast and although Burn Zombie Burn! isn’t a twin stick shooter in the strictest sense of the word, with the lock-on button pressed and held in you can almost play it like one if you so desire. DoubleSix wanted you to look at this game as more of an old school 16-bit style shooter though, with the character firing forwards at all times, so work through the tutorial slowly and take in everything the game has to offer and the controls will become second nature quickly enough.\n\nVisually it’s actually quite nice. The environments are spooky and play up to the obvious clichés, as do the characters and even the weapons, but they’re solid and smooth enough to impress and despite the game engine managing to throw around 120 zombies at once the frame rate holds up perfectly. The sound is also exactly as you’d expect, cheesy but good humoured music complimented by a raft of moans and groans peppered with the crack from your machine gun is all we could have wished for. The game also offers a split screen multiplayer which is great fun.\n\nSo, another quality title just perfect for those afternoons when all you want to do is take our your anger on a pack of hungry zombies. Burn Zombie Burn! is well produced, smartly priced, great fun and a nice addition to anyone’s game libarary. The risk-reward nature of the gameplay in Burn Zombie Burn is enough to make the player return for more, if not the adrenaline inducing intensity. Whilst the task may, on the face of it, look repetitive, it never feels tired or boring to play. If high-score chasing gives you pleasure, then Burn Zombie Burn comes highly recommended.","March 10","true","59.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

However, these burning zombies are more dangerous. I like this mechanism.\nUnfortunately the game itself becomes boring after a short time, since it is really always the same. After 30min one has seen almost everything the game offers. There is no interesting story, no nice rewards, nothing which keeps my motivation. In addition, I don't like the crosshair, which is a glowing cursor. I had to search it all the time in the hordes of zombies.

It played well, fun to kill mass hordes of zombies, but something was missing...\n\nPerhaps I needed freinds or to play online with strangers.  I played an 1.5 hours and unlocked the third mission and found myself not wanting to play it.\n\nThe basic idea is there is an "Arena" level you fight as long as you can until you die.  So there is no exploration, no true bosses (big zombie that farts fire though), and each level is nothing more thn a different layout but more of the same.\n\nYou can only progress if you get a high enough score to unlock the next area.  I spent 45 minutes on one level with a scote off 850,000 and still only got a bronze to unlock the third level.\n\nOverall it is not a bad game, but the fast paced arena combat to get really high scores can make your brain tired because the combat keeps ramping higher and higher with no slow down or breaks.  So you can spend an hour in maximum focus... perhaps I am too old for this, lmao !\n\nNot bad, but not for me I guess.  And I normally like Smash TV type gameplay and arena combat.","June 7, 2013","false","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you right-click you hold up a torch to light zombies a blaze. This is usefull to get a multiplier to gain more points, also the zombies are easier to kill, but the zombies are faster and stronger, it such a great mechanic.\n3. If you get three combos, you can press the button (which is in the middle of the map) and it can help you kill some zombies (But in the woods, it is not usefull)\n4.

Computers come with a mouse and keyboard, hence my generalizing back there, a few lines up.\n\nNonetheless, the game is still very fun, no matter what control setup you happen to use.

Probably enough that you don't need to worry about one that came out over 4 years ago. Burn Zombie Burn has exactly one interesting mechanic, and that's that you get a melee attack that sets zombies on fire. Every zombie currently on fire adds one to your score multiplier, and killing a burning zombie can yield better powerups. However, burning zombies move faster, hit harder, and if they burn to death award you no points. So if you want to be grandmaster of zombie murder, you have to balance setting zombies on fire against mowing them down.\n\nOutside of that, you have a standard assortment of guns and chainsaws and bombs. There are some unique zombie types you've seen before like exploding ones and armored ones. You can trigger a special event for each level like the zombies doing the Thriller dance if you get high enough combos with a single weapon. The graphics are ugly cartoony, and the blood spray particle effect wouldn't render for me so I got black boxes every time I hit a zombie. Your character's hair looks like poop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Irredine/recommended/50510/","Irredine","Irredine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Irredine/","254 products in account","This is an arcade style game. From what I played, it did well with what you would expect from an arcade game such as the action pacing, score oriented goal and power-ups on the map. As far as I can tell, it doesn't offer a storyline/plot, but that wouldn't be a big detraction from an arcade game. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the game because I was easily defeated frequently as a result of both the controls for xbox controler and mouse/keyboard. The controls are not as natural as I would like it and it is difficult to strafe fire and maneuver the character avoiding the enemies at the same time. Unexpectedly, the mouse/keyboard was easier than the gamepad, simply because the gamepad left stick moves the character, but the right stick does not control aim. As a result, I had to run forward into enemies shooting as my only move-and-shoot option with gamepad. However, the keyboard allows you to strafe-and-shoot as you would expect of a zombie defense game. Unfortunately, I couldn't move the character in any other direction than cardinal directions (North, S, E, W).\n\nSimply put, i felt the controls were conflicting too much with my manueverability and being able to attack at the same time. I didn't feel interested in continuing or attempting to adapt to the controls because I was off put by them.","May 15","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Burn! first.\nSimply put the point goals have been set way too damn high and even the best of players have gone over ten minutes of enduring one level just to achieve a Silver.\n\nAlso, per Vyrastas extremely informative point scoring walkthrough\nhttp://au.ign.com/faqs/2011/burn-zombie-burn-walkthrough-1081706\nHe mentions that the R1 button feature has been removed from the Steam release. Holding down the shoulder button allowed for manual aiming apparently using one of the analogues'\n\nFrom YouTube playthroughs I have also noticed the Lawnmower weapon turning up more frequently in the native PS3 version and it is that Lawnmower + Zombies on Fire which scores and drops dynamite upgrades the quickest.\n\nBut despite the painstaking goal ahead of Steam gamers, Burn Zombie applies good old fashioned thumb-active game play and this is to be as heavily pointed out as it is commended.\n\nOn release there were many cries for twin stick shooting (unfortunately offered in sequels) thus ignoring that such unsophisticated controls not only take away much of the challenge but also removes the feature of each weapon having it's own unique manner of use: ie; rapid pressing of the fire button while holding the pistol offers quick but weak bursts while shorter and harder presses release less bullets but those shots do more damage.\n\nIn this wave shooter the number of zombies released at one time is perfectly balanced. The controls would be enjoyable for those who love getting thumb exercise on game pads and it is this alone that makes BZB worth purchase on the XBox......\n\n\nThe one omitted button function in this PC version pretty much trashed the PC port completey.","June 27, 2014","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
