Create and bake a cake accurately and quickly to achieve the most points to move on to the next stage of your baking career.\n\nI have played this game since the beginning and it is very addicting to continue even after completing the game.  I believe there is a small learning curve but once you are used to the controls and the different variations of creating the cake off you go to help the baker's grandmother to save her bakery.","June 25, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The third installment includes minigames and a greater variety. There is a far superior sequel on steam "Cake Mania: Main Street" which will probably give you more playtime than this whole bundle, for a lower price. However, if you want to play them all, start with the earlier ones to get the most enjoyment out of them.\n\nNB If you are unable to run any of the games, ensure that you are running them in compatability mode. See this post for how to do that.","March 12","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
