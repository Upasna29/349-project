The anime is a great adaptation in two ways. First, it does not cut out or distort many important plot points, although there are certainly changes. Second, it makes fantastic use of the advantages of the animated medium to create suspense.\n\nThe visual novel, however, explains several key plot points better than the anime does. Most importantly, the visual novel portrays paranoia and confusion far better than anime ever could. The visual novel really gets you thinking like the protagonist thinks, whereas the anime just has you experiencing what the protagonist experiences.\n\nChapter 1, Onikakushi, covers the first four episodes of the anime.\n\n---\n\nTwo main things set Higurashi apart from otherwise similar horror titles.\n\nSlice of Life Camaraderie\nHigurashi in its entirety isn't just a story about how bad things happen and a bunch of people die. At its core, it is a story about overcoming adversity (although the first chapter is very much about bad things happening).\n\nHigurashi's early slice of life scenes reinforce this overarching positive theme. They depict a group of friends who participate in cutthroat competitions on a daily basis. They struggle and play dirty to improve themselves and each other. It's very much not your usual slice of life.\n\nParanoia\nParanoia plays a huge role in the first few chapters of Higurashi. Many characters deeply involved in the series of murders have yet to be revealed. Two main characters have yet to be introduced. The protagonist, and by extension the reader, doesn't know why or even what is happening. In this way, Higurashi is quite similar to the visual novel Chaos;Head (excuse me, ChäoS;HEAd). An unreliable protagonist tries to survive and figure out what the hell is going on.\n\nYou could say that Higurashi is to horror visual novels as Amnesia: The Dark Descent is to horror video games.\n\n---\n\nHigurashi is phenomenal bang for your buck in terms of both quality and quantity. It is very much enjoyable as a standalone work, but also leads into a greater overarching story. What are you waiting for?","May 15, 2015","true","100.2"," 320 of 345 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","320","345","12","5"

It's had anime adaptations, its own manga series, OVAs, live-action films, even a third-person shooter. The cult surrounding this VN undoubtedly made 07th Expansion what it is today. How's the Steam release, then?\n\nReturning players will notice that the English translation has been entirely redone. MangaGamer opted to do away with the subpar 2009 official translation and redid all of EP1's script from scratch. The results are satisfying; characters speak naturally, inner monologues don't feel stilted, and wordplay is more sophisticated.\nMangaGamer contracted an artist to create new character art to replace Ryukishi07's original work. Again, the results pay off as the new character sprites look professional and do a great job at conveying the emotions of the characters. I personally prefer the new art to the old, but purists can switch between the two by simply pressing 'P'.\nThe Steam version of Higurashi runs on an entirely different engine than the original, an engine which allows the game components to be modded at the players' leisure. Players who wish to use the PS2 character art, PS3 backgrounds, etc. are easily able to modify Higurashi's files to do so. The new engine doesn't interfere with normal gameplay at all, and returning players might not even notice it.\nAll of these make the Steam version one of the greatest ways to experience Higurashi, but how's the story itself? Engaging, to say the least; first-time players often find it difficult to stop reading once they've invested time and emotion into the plot and characters. Each chapter ('Onikakushi' being one of eight) is roughly 7-9 hours in length, so you'll definitely not feel cheated for content by the time you finish.\n\nHigurashi has earned its acclaim/notoriety. If you ever wanted to get into VNs, this is one of the best you can start with.","May 20, 2015","true","10.3"," 144 of 149 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","144","149","4","4"

The Steam version is a remaster of the original Sound Novel which includes the option to switch between the new sprites or the original sprites.\n\nThe story in itself is a solid horror/thriller experience, it throws you in a shoe of Maebara Keiichi, a recent transfer student to Hinamizawa and his experience with his friend. The beginning of the game shows you an all-happy go round group of friends and kyute girls that as they go about doing kyute things. As the story progress, Keiichi discover that there was a bloody murder in Hinamizawa. Confused and curious about what happen, he started asking his kyute friends about the incident but they keep denying it happens, which makes Keiichi starting to doubt his friends. The story starts to get interesting around the end of Watanagashi festival, I won't spoil the rest of the story but expect a crazy ride after that.\n\nIf you have already watched the anime, then you must read this VN (I know I said Higurashi is a Sound Novel, but blame Chunsoft on that one) since the anime butchered a lot of content from the VN. There is no choice to be made since this is a kinetic VN and no it doesn't have voice acting even though it was promoted as Sound Novel (blame Chunsoft). Also this is just the first chapters/arcs of Higurashi so expect to shell out another $6 for Tsumiboroshi, Meakashi, Watanagashi, Matsuribayashi, Tatarigoroshi, Minagoroshi & Himatsubushi. Based corporate :^)\n\nClosing this review, I recommend any oldf*gs out there (like myself ;-;) who have played Higurashi before to play this one not only because of the updated sprite, but also unifying all your Higurashi in one place (Steam) is nice if you didn't have the physical copy of all Higurashi. If you're interested/new to the series, love horror/thriller genre or have watched the anime and still feel that it's lacking, pick this up and sate your horror/thriller need.\n\nAlso, Umineko f*cking when MangaGamer?","May 16, 2015","true","5.3"," 102 of 111 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","102","111","11","1"

Much.  Content.\n\nThis remastered sound novel contains the first four episodes of the anime.  In rough numbers, this is about an hour and a half of content.  As someone who can read rather fast, this sound novel took me almost nine hours.  This wasn't two hours of good content and seven of boring padding, but rather nine solid hours of enjoyment.  Seeing the thoughts behind Keiichi, the main character, change as the novel progresses, seeing more of the average day life that the cast goes through prior to Watanagashi, and just in general seeing things fleshed out so much more than in the show was wonderful.  The atmosphere was perfect throughout, and the character sprites were much more engaging than I was expecting as someone new to sound novels.  My only real complaint was the total lack of choices throughout.  I know through the friend that got me into this series in the first place that later chapters will have them, but it was surprising to both of us that this one was completely on rails.  This didn't detract from the story, but did feel a little disappointing.\n\nSo, do I recommend this experience?  Whether you've seen the show, or want to see what all the fuss is about before looking at either the rest of the novels or the show, I most certainly do.  For $6, you get a book complete with backgrounds, character sprites, and sounds.  You get a fantastic first chapter of a fantastic story.  You get heartwarming moments, heartbreaking moments, and a few truly creepy moments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Veltharis/recommended/310360/","Veltharis","Veltharis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Veltharis/","49 products in account","First, a brief note to the uninitiated:\n\nThis is not a pleasant story, whatever the screenshots may have led you to believe. Beneath the veneer of a cheesy, run-of-the-mill school-comedy lies a cruel world of madness, terror, and violence. Major characters die routinely; sometimes on-screen, sometimes off, but never in a peaceful manner. Nonetheless, it is a highly compelling experience, and very rewarding if you can endure to the end of the series. If this intrigues you, feel free to read on, but those looking for nothing more than a stereotypical anime-harem-style rom-com would do well to look elsewhere. Higurashi may resemble that on a superficial level, but this is a series that delights in letting the reader think they know what is going on, even as it brings the façade crumbling down around them.\n\nNow, then..\n\nEach chapter of Higurashi When They Cry is a seemingly self-contained story comprised of three distinct parts. The first is indeed a light-hearted slice-of-life comedy, centered around a mixed-age group of students living in a remote Japanese village in the early 1980s. Made up of four local girls and the protagonist, a boy who just recently moved into town, this group spends their time going to school, playing a variety of games together (usually under the threat of ridiculous and embarrassing penalties for losing), and generally goofing around. This relaxed, easy-going atmosphere – filled with ruthless card games, lunchtime chopstick duels, and treasure-hunting at an illegal garbage dump – appears at first glance to be utterly inviolate; a tranquil, serene place where nothing tragic could ever happen.\n\nInevitably, this atmosphere begins to sour, as the locals' carefully hidden secret – a four year long string of deaths and disappearances – starts to show through the illusion of a peaceful country village. Seemingly straightforward on the surface, with little reason to believe they may be connected, these incidents nonetheless have some disturbing things in common. The victims have some connection – albeit increasingly tenuous ones – to an old, hotly contested dam construction project. And each of these events occurred around the time of an annual religious festival held at the village shrine every June. While most try not to speak of them, particularly to outsiders, or pass them off as sad coincidences, these incidents invariably give rise to rumors of a conspiracy within the village to purge it of those perceived as enemies... Or, among the superstitious, of the curse of an angry god.\n\nFinally, the proverbial dam breaks and events begin to spiral out of control in a sudden, rapidly escalating drama of suspicion, violence, and murder, suffused with a pervasive psychological horror that straddles the line between a supernatural malice and one that is all-too-human in nature. Personal secrets are dredged up and sins exposed, showing characters the reader thought they knew in a very different light, while eerily echoing centuries old regional legends that speak of this place not as a quiet, insular community, but rather as a monstrous village of man-eating demons – oni, for those into Japanese mythology. Who is at fault? Is anyone at fault? Could the crime have been prevented? Do you even know what the crime is?\n\nAt times switching gears so seamlessly that you hardly notice and at others doing so with a deliberately jarring abruptness, these three elements combine together to gradually build an atmosphere of tension, terror, and inexorably approaching tragedy, even as they challenge the protagonist and reader alike to uncover the truth of what exactly is happening in this tiny mountain village.\n\nHigurashi When They Cry is a “visual novel” in a stricter sense than most, known as a “kinetic” or “linear” visual novel that lacks player choice, as opposed to the more typical form of visual novel built around branching storylines. Gameplay amounts to the same kind of “player interaction” that can be experienced by reading a traditional mystery novel – gathering clues from the narrative, building and revising a theory, and attempting to reach the correct solution before the author reveals the answers in the end.\n\nAs previously mentioned, each chapter is essentially self-contained: covering roughly the same period of time; utilizing the same pool of characters (regardless of what may have happened to them in a previous chapter); and featuring the same general situation. Yet each story also differs in various ways. Different characters and their backgrounds take on the central roles. New characters are introduced and previously minor ones are expanded upon. Some plot elements are explained away, while others are unveiled for the first time. And ultimately, a new, unique chain of events is brought about, leading to its own distinct conclusion. Later chapters toy with this formula in various fashions, one notable way being by changing the protagonist to tell, or retell, the story from a different character's perspective. All together, this allows the reader – through repetition, of sorts – to gradually start to distinguish the events that are fixed, that are certain, from those that can change, what is real from what is illusion, and try to piece together the truth, perhaps even finding the miracle that leads to a happy ending somewhere along the way.\n\nWith each chapter seeming to have no bearing on the events in any of the others, this series can be understandably confusing for new readers, who will have difficulty working out exactly how the disjointed pieces are meant to fit together. In the interest of aiding those not yet “in the know” I will offer this, decidedly non-spoiler, interpretation: consider each chapter as a particular “path” from a Choose Your Own Adventure book or branching-style visual novel, only written as its own individual story and given to the reader in sequential order. While not entirely accurate, this viewpoint should allow new readers to reconcile the apparent disconnect between chapters until such mysteries begin to be revealed in the series' second half.\n\nHigurashi is also described as a “sound novel”, owing to the developer's emphasis on the use of background music and sound effects to help shape the atmosphere of each scene. This is done exceedingly well, although many of the better pieces of music start to appear in the later chapters. At the same time, the developer, 07th Expansion, and the game's author, Ryukishi07, are very much the Japanese equivalent of an indie studio, with Higurashi being their first project. Nowhere does this show through more than in the graphics. The background images are largely ordinary photographs with a filter over them and the original character sprites, while expressive and charming in their own way, are fairly amateur work. The character sprites can be switched out to updated, more professional ones in the options menu, if so desired.\n\nThere are some minor details regarding the translation that could use some polish, but overall it is a thoroughly engaging affair alternately capable of making the reader laugh out loud and sending a chill down their spine. After letting Onikakushi and Watanagashi sit unplayed on my desktop for months due to time constraints, I just recently powered my way through both available chapters, promptly reread the entirety of the manga series, then played Onikakushi through again. I'd have done the same for Watanagashi, but my love for Higurashi's quasi-sequel Umineko has flared up and stolen away my attention for the time being.\n\nAs a long time fan of the When They Cry franchise, my only complaint is that the next chapter isn't out yet. If you have even a moderate tolerance for what one prominent video game critic refers to as “Anime Bull****”, I cannot recommend this series highly enough.\n\nWelcome to Hinamizawa.\n\n...\n\n...Is anyone else hearing footsteps behind them? *absently scratches neck*","January 27","true","29.6"," 73 of 76 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","73","76","6","0"

When you're fully immersed in a state of mind where your attention is drawn, or rather forced towards a source of fear and terror, the unpleasantness serves to pull your mind away from a life of deadlines, chores and unfulfillment. In that sense, it's a lot like drenching bland food in plenty of hot sauce - sure, your mouth may sting to high heaven, but at least you don't have to taste what you're eating.\n\nIn that sense, Onikakushi drew me in hard. The premise isn't anything that original (an insular country town with a dark history harbours an unpleasant secret that you stumble upon by chance) but the execution is exceptional. The degree to which it pulls you into the psychological state of doubt, terror, helplessness, paranoia and delusion is so extensive that I experienced horrible acid flashbacks at no less than four points in the story. By the time it was over, I felt tangible relief.\n\nThe main plot takes a while to get going - the buildup takes up almost half the story and is composed almost entirely of dumb anime tropes, if that sort of thing might turn you off (personally, I'm fine with it), but the payoff is well worth it. I'd highly recommend this, especially at so cheap a price.","October 19, 2015","true","9.8"," 67 of 68 people (99%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","99","67","68","6","0"

You expect something interesting with that hook for an opening, but 10 minutes later it feels like you're dragging your feet. The beginning, despite the very opening, is very slow and although I knew this was a big name in the western VN community, I almost put it down. It was a fellow Fuwanovel (a visual novel forum) member who told me to hang in there because it picked up once you got to the festival.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nIt picked up quite a bit before that. In my opinion the second Mion pulls out a deck of cards and invites Keiichi (our protagonist) to play a game of Old Maid with the girls, all of the little things that had grated me about each girl before washed away. The sharp eye Keiichi held playing the game engrossed me into the scenario long before the festival was held, before the children, and our main character, had to worry about the real genre at heart--a horror story.\n\nThe game ran me about 8-10 hours. There was a little idle time when I got up to go to the bathroom or grab a drink, and I played through the "Thank you" after bit for the last achievement, but it was still a good 8-10 hours of gameplay that had me laying in bed --mouse in hand-- as late as 5 am wanting to find out what would happen.\n\nThis game is $6 for more than 8 hours of enjoyment. I don't know how you could not suggest it to anyone. If you think you enjoy Visual Novels, this is a definite classic among western VN fans and you should check it out. If you like anime, manga or reading, AND you like the horror genre, I'd also hands down reccomend this visual novel.\n\nI think the most off-putting, at a glance, feature of this game is that it's only Ch 1. DOn't be fooled I believe it is technically 15 chapters within this single Ch 1 release. Onikakushi comes from the full game Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. The game itself clocks into the "Long" range according to VNDB (visual novel database) which is classified as 30-50 hours of gameplay. Ch 1 is part 1 of 4 for this first game compilation so if you were to buy all 4 parts it would be ~$24 dollars, a little less if you follow the series and then pre-order the next 3 games on MangaGamer when they offer it for 10% off. It's only $6 to buy into the series, and if you decide, for whatever reason, you don't like it then it's not much of a loss, if you decide you do VNs for this full length (30-50 hours) normally run you somewhere around $45. Overall it's a really good deal.","June 5, 2015","true","10.6"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","57","60","2","1"

A lot of mystery solving, blood and gore, and yandere. Although originally a visual novel and this being the Steam remake, the Higurashi series is widely known in the anime fan culture, and even on the internet due to some memes being born from it, as well as many scenes of the anime being uploaded on YouTube. The games in the series have been released on PC, PS2, PS3, PS Vita, iOS, Android, and Nintendo DS, as well as the popular anime adaptation and the manga adaptations. I first discovered Higurashi from the clips on YouTube and it has been one of my favorite franchises ever since. This particular arc, Onikakushi-hen is one of my favorites because I own the manga adaptation of it. I have also played Watanagashi-hen and Meakashi-hen.\n\nThe gameplay of a visual novel game is pretty basic. You click and read the text that's on the screen. Pretty simple, huh? Well, Higurashi is a different case. The story follows the myth of  Oyashiro-sama's Curse, a myth that is linked to consecutive murders that occur every summer in the town of Hinamizawa. With every murder, another person goes missing. Every story arc is like the movie Groundhog Day as you are stuck in a time-loop. There are 4 main Question arcs, and 4 Answer arcs, and many other extra arcs that go deeper into the story. You play the role of Keiichi Maebara, who recently moves to Hinamizawa. Every story arc is different because in every arc, a different character falls victim to The Hinamizawa Syndrome, which causes the character to act in strange and violent ways. By reading the story and reading tips that you can unlock, you start to figure out what's going on, who's responsible for the strange acts, and the murders of some of the main characters.

That means good.\n\nImportant Information to KnowThis game covers the first arc (Abducted by Demons arc, about 2 manga volumes long) of the story, while it says Ch.1 this game covers the first 4-5 episodes of the show and has something like 12 chapters in the game. This game is a visual novel with about 15 hours of reading. A visual novel is basically a book with relevant background music, sound effects, background art, and character art to enhance the reading experience.\n\nAbout the story - mostly spoiler freeHigurashi No Naku Koro Ni (aka Higurashi When They Cry, or just When They Cry) can be described as a Slice of Life Comedy and a Mystery Psychological Horror/Thriller, one of the bloodiest and most disturbing in the genre. Which turns many people away early on, but if you stay with it you learn it's about the human needs for friends, trust, and communication.\nWhile each arc is a completed story it does not complete the overall story of the series. Each arc shows a different version of the Hinamizawa mystery, each time showing you news clues and introducing new characters. If you stick through the entire story you will basically see the same story several times, slightly different each time before ultimately seeing an overall conclusion. It's like playing a game where you have to reach a bunch of Bad Ends before you learn how to win and get a Happy Ending.\nIt is also easily one of the most rewarding stories I have ever experienced.\n\nAreas for improvementI found myself wishing the artwork used was more manga-like, namely that characters would be drawn with objects they were holding (not just their apparel changes) and that they drew out certain key scenes.\nExamples (these are all pretty bad spoilers, beware):\nThe newer art style for Mion does not show her carrying a gun when in civilian attire. Also I would've liked to have seen the characters holding playing cards when they were playing card games. Rena carrying an axe whenever she was, Mion holding a syringe, Rena with a giant teddy bear after they win it, I could probably do without them holding chopsticks when they were eating but that wouldn't hurt the immersion either. In the later epsiodes there will be times when the characters have blood on them, I'd like to actually see blood on their character art, and I'd like to see the scar on Shion's back when they get to that part.\nDuring the Needle scene showing Keiichi's hand with a needle in it would've been great, or showing a picture of a white van when Keiichi gets hit by the van, showing some fingers trapped in the door when Keiichi shuts the door on Rena's fingers, things like this. The later episodes will show torture and murder scenes that I feel should be drawn out for the readers like in the Manga and Anime.\nCost EffectivenessCompared to other media with the same story- The visual novel costs $6 through steam and covers the first arc of the story, in Manga form (your trading in reading atmosphere for better illustrations) this is about 2 volumes which equate to around $20, in Anime form (your trading in extra content that can't be adequately described through a show, such as thought and feelings of the character for a story with better illustrations and sounds)  this is 4-5 episodes which will cost you like $40 as a DvD. While you can find the Manga and Anime online for free, you could also probably find this game somewhere online for free if you're determined to go that route.\nCompared to other games- This game ($6) has about 15 hours of reading, which is about the amount of time I spent playing Axiom Verge ($20). In my opinion this visual novel was a much more rewarding experience, and while Axiom Verge has immediate replay value, this story will have more replay value a year or 2 from now when I've forgotten about it.","May 28, 2015","true","23.1"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","46","50","3","2"

Like reading a book or short story on a tablet or your computer.\nSome give you the option to make decisions while others are simply telling a story. There are plenty of Visual Novels on other places besides Steam. Some good, bad, serious, funny, all-ages, and the more adult oriented ones.\nIf you'd like you can check out more here Visual Novel Database[vndb.org]\n\n\nTo start things off. I'm still very very VERY new to the VN scene.\nI have been meaning to delve deeper into this genre, but never got around to it.\nMy prior experience with any kind of Visual Novel was Katawa Shoujo, but even with that I never really finished it.\n(To those that have played it. I got to the start of the school festival then suddenly stopped)\nI do have a bit of "Eroge" Visual Novels stashed away for a rainy day, but my ability to read Japanese is practically Zero.\n\n\nSo about Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi\nIt would be really hard to review the actual Visual Novel without practically sticking in spoilers.\nI've never played previous versions of this VN and have not seen the Anime related to this.\nI had a rough idea of what I was getting into because of the internet, but it never fully prepared me for this.\n\nThe Character Sprites:\nThe new character sprites are done really well compared to the older version.\nI tried switching between the two sprites, but always found myself going for the more modern one.\nThe newer ones took up less screen and made the text easier to read and I really liked the emotions each character displayed.\nThe older ones would definitely give some nostalgia points to previous readers, but they ate up a lot of the screen making it hard to read the text and understand what was going on.\nThe way the older ones were drawn also killed my immersion.\nI'm probably spoiled by what Modern Anime looks like today to sway me into keeping the updated character sprites.\n\nThe Characters:\nI would love to give a detail into what characters are in the story and their backgrounds, but as I said previously I want to keep that bit hidden so that new readers will go in with an open-mindset.\nI can say that the Characters were well done and their dialogue gave me a few laughs.\n\nThe Story:\nThis is all I can really say. Absolutely amazing 8/10\nThe length of finishing this is roughly 8 or 9 hours so make sure you're comfortable.\nAs a bonus if you use a wireless/wired controller then you can use that as some sort of remote to progress through the dialogue.\nGod I wish I could write more on this topic, but it's always best to experience something with an open mind\nGo in without knowing as little as possible and use what you experienced from your playthrough to form an opinion.\n\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nI really wish more VN's would release on Steam.\nAnd I really wish that more people would actually review the VN instead of leaving dumb things like "420/10 WOULD FUG AND WAIFU LMAO" because it's "MUH ANUMAY"\nI get sick of seeing people with less than an hour of playtime reviewing the game and giving it a review similar to that."\nPlease try not to be one of those people.\nIt's an Anime related game on Steam.

The visual novels themselves have been out since 2002, but the game has seen a lot of fan updates and semi-official updates that have never been put into full effect until now. The best way to describe this is as an unofficial remake for those who had never gotten into the franchise before. In the meantime, the series has had an anime, manga and other merchandise that has made it a household name for those who are very familiar with anime, or just visual novel games in general. For those who haven't heard of this, though, Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.1 Onikakushi, is a great way to start out the series and to get into the franchise at its original source.\n\n07th Expansion originally drew all of the art of the characters of Higurashi and while he did try, they were, quite frankly, awful. But not everyone can draw, and luckily there have been updated sprites that you can switch on and off at your leisure. For anyone who just wants better art, the best mode of action would be to turn on these new sprites rather than dealing with the old ones. The background art is nice and while it is a little blurry because it's just supposed to be the backdrop to where they characters are it is still nice to look at during the very long dialogue sequences.\n\nHigurashi is a visual novel, which means there isn't a lot of gameplay but a lot of reading. This is a niche genre for a reason, not everybody likes to click endlessly through dialogue, but this game is one of the better examples of visual novels, because it does give you some choices and keeps you entertained rather than boring you with mundane conversations all the time. There will be times where you are given fairly relaxed conversations between schoolmates, but those conversations don't always stay the same tone, which means you'll be treated to some humorous moments and general character bonding activities, like eating lunch together or learning math.\n\nWhat makes Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.1 Onikakushi special is the fact that it doesn't stay very nice for very long. You play Keiichi Maebara who just transferred to Hinamizawa from the city, and the first pieces of dialogue he says may turn you completely off his character. The game confusingly starts out in a sort of future past, him recalling what happened before the events of his little monologue which is played over the sound of squishing and cracking body parts in the background.\n\nIn case you didn't know by the description, Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.1 Onikakushi is a horror game and it is the most deceptively packaged horror game you will ever see. After that traumatizing moment you immediately go to the past where Keiichi is just waking up for another day at school. From there we are introduced to his entire group of friends, all of which play a part in the events to come later on in the story. A tale of lies, deceit, gore, murder, body horror, and nightmare fuel inducing stuff all placed under the clever guise of cute girls being friends with a guy who acts like a jerk. The tone of the game shifts constantly, always keeping you on edge. You never know when a conversation will devolve into zany antics or downright sinister threats. You couldn't tell by the art style, and you'd think this was just a silly romance game, but it's not; this game is there to mess with you when you're clicking through the dialogue.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","June 2, 2015","true","1.8"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","27","30","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maeomuku/recommended/310360/","maeomuku","GG On That","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maeomuku/","57 products in account","Higurashi When They Cry is a psychological horror visual novel which originally released in Japan in 2002.  Onikakushi is the first chapter in the saga.  Set in 1983, the story follows Keiichi Maebara as he and his parents move to the quiet, rural village of Hinamizawa.  As he settles into his new school and befriends his classmates, Keiichi begins to hear of some gruesome murders that happened in the town a few years prior to his arrival and is naturally interested to find out more.  What started out as innocent curiosity leads Keiichi further into a dangerous town conspiracy, and as the paranoia sets in, he soon discovers that those closest to him may be the very ones he should be running from.\n\nPlot/Writing:Higurashi When They Cry is praised as one of the best visual novels out there for a reason, and this port does an excellent job of portraying its well-written dialogue to a western audience.  Few visual novels present the genuine sense of paranoia, loneliness and vulnerability that Higurashi does, and fans of psychological horror should look no further since this game acts as a stunning example of the genre and then some.\n\nArt:You have two options when it comes to character portraits; the original art from the game's first release or the brand new art exclusive to this port.  The latter is set as the default and I highly recommend keeping it that way; the art is slick, clean and presents the characters and their emotions well.  I'd even go so far as to say the art is more polished in this version than in the recently released PS3 port of the game.\n\nSound:Higurashi When They Cry and the later-released Umineko When They Cry are both described as 'sound novels' by their creators; meaning that there is a heavy emphasis on the sound effects and background music of each scene.  This is especially true for Higurashi; the ambience of the country village of Hinamizawa is forever set with the constant chirping of the cicadas in almost every scene, and the background music can go from incredibly bouncy to downright chilling in seconds.\n\nFlaws:Higurashi When They Cry could be easily criticised for its incredibly slow opening.  Although this serves to simply make the player feel connected to the characters before the horror scenes take place, many people could grow tired and give up reading before it gets good.  Not until midway into the chapter does the pacing pick up to the point where the game becomes too good to put down.  Furthermore, unlike other visual novels, there are no choices to be made, branching paths to discover or multiple endings to see; it is pure reading from start to finish, and although this is essentially what a visual novel is anyway, the complete absence of player interaction could be seen as a flaw.\n\nTL;DR:Pros:\nFantastic writing; easily one of the best visual novels of the genre\nTruly chilling horror scenes are worth waiting for\nPolished, sleek character art that complements the story well\nSound effects and soundtrack work together well to add to the tension\n10-15 hours of reading content is worth the cost of entry\nCons:\nVery slow opening could make players lose interest quickly\nZero player interaction unlike other visual novels could hurt player interest\nLet's hope the next chapter releases soon!","June 25, 2015","true","21.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

It was first released in 2002 as a visual novel but most here in the west are probably more familiar with the Studio Deen anime series that was an adaptation of the series. Despite the cutesy sprite art and generally energetic feel that dominates most of the work, it is solidly a mystery and thriller- or suspense-type visual novel.\n\nThis is a straight port and slight remaster of that original visual novel. It is very much a novel and essentially reads like one, with time to read depending on how fast you can read. I read through the arcs, which took around 5 - 8 hours per arc. There are no choices, no voice acting, and no branching storyline. There's also no gore to be found here, so if you are squeamish or have heard about the series' reputation, don't let that dissuade you.\n\nUnlike MangaGamer's previous version of this, the original music was restored, and additionally, more "traditionally animesque" sprites were added as an alternative to Ryukishi07's (the author). The translation, also, has also been improved quite a lot from what I remember of the previous version.\n\nI think 6$ is a fair price for what it is, a solid visual novel, and at the same price as the crappy iOS port you get a much  better product.","May 15, 2015","true","2.8"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","38","51","5","1"

I remember watching the 2nd season when it was currently airing and having an episode be cancelled due to an axe murder in Japan. Nostalgic times. Nice boat–wait, that’s School Days.\n\nHigurashi takes a while to start, but what makes it amusing to me is how cute and innocent it all is in the beginning. Compared to other visual novels, this one is linear with no routes or choices for you to choose, so there is no need to worry about making mistakes. The point of saving is merely to bookmark.\n\nBackgrounds are photographs with filters applied to them, but I recently learned this is quite common with VNs, especially if they’re older such as Higurashi(2002). Those who are bothered by it should install the PS3 mod. I played without it, but wish I knew about it earlier.\n\nThe game is mostly character portraits and text. There aren’t pictured scenes that depict crucial moments in the story, but Higurashi is more of a sound novel than a visual novel, I think. Sound novels rely more on sound effects and text. I think it’s great if you can be spooked just by a description and a sound cue. I have a bit of a guilty pleasure for them. Other sound novels I would recommend are Banshee’s Last Cry(Kamaitachi no Yoru), 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, and Virtue’s Last Reward. A horror VN I would recommend in general is Saya no Uta, but that has um.. H-scenes.\n\nAnyways some people might not like the story or think it’s over the top ridiculous. That’s fine. This is just the prologue and everything is going to get crazier from here on out.","July 2, 2015","true","14.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","20","23","5","0"

And that was with a translation that, frankly, was on par with taking the lyrics to Keiichi Oishi no Uwasa Jikenbo ABC, running it through google translate and calling it a day. Yes, the original translation was... not the best, to say the least. Still! Higurashi quickly became the franchise I most adored and loved, despite this. Now that this new translation has come out, it feels like reuniting with an old friend.\n\nStill, like meeting an old friend in real life, things (while nostalgic) have changed. Some for the better, some not. To begin, let's look at the good. The translation is better than the old one, but that's like saying being poisoned is better than being dismembered. There's still quite a few typos hanging around, nothing that will break the game (well, besides Rena forgetting to say a VERY plot relevant word at one point, but one can infer what she said easily enough, I suppose...) but it is far better than the old translation. At least I didn't see untranslated kanji hanging around anywhere.\n\nThe sprites? My Oyashiro, I loved the new sprites. They're very polished, very nice. Admittedly, Ooishi was never meant for a more realistic image and, as such, looks uncomfortable but, in the end, all is good. I'm just thankful Rena's hands are no longer indistinguishable from hams. I don't see why anyone would play with the old sprites, but as I'm about to demonstrate, I suppose people can get attached to the strangest things.\n\nAlso, is it just me or is this translation a lot longer than the previous one?\n\nAh well, onto my nitpicks. When redoing a translation, there is a burning question of how much should be kept from the inferior translations "flavour". The little detail, the minor word choices... As someone who spent so much of his time reading/watching everything Higurashi repeatedly, these little changes stick out like a cleaver in broad daylight. Ohagi has been changed to mochi, "hauu" has become "hao", 07th Mart (that one store Keiichi visits that one time) has been changed to  Smart Seven... These little details stood out to me, but they're not the end of the world by any means. In fact, if you're bugged by them you probably have little to no life. So, yeah. I was bugged by them, but that isn't important.\n\nWhat is important is the fact that Rika's "nipaah" has been changed to "yeah", it seems. This surprised me. It's such a strange change, considering that "nipaah" is basically Rika's catchphrase. But again, it won't ruin the game for you. It's just a shame that some of the original flavour has been changed.\n\nSo, overall, Higurashi remains a strong VN. It's wonderful and creating a constantly increasing state of tension and mystery. Pleasantly creepy, disturbing, unnerving... It really does keep you on your toes and jumping at shadows. Which is what it aims to do, so mission accomplished! Similarly, it makes a fantastic use of humour. I'd forgotten that Higurashi can be lighthearted and even hilarious at times (maybe it's just me, but this translations Keiichi seems a lot more sarcastic than usual.) Some of the sound decision in this game is particularly wonderful, especially now that we're dealing with the fantastic original tracks. Areas where sounds and music bleed and blend into eachother until the sound of crying Higurashi embeds itself on your eardrums. Of course, at times, the music cuts to other tracks in uncomfortably sudden ways but it's not the end of the world. We haven't reached that Arc yet.\n\nSo, all in all, whether you're a new transfer to Hinamizawa or a returning villager this game is a must buy! And a great starting VN, if you're looking to jump into the world, if I say so myself (it was one of the VNs that personally got me interested in the medium/style.)\n\nSo, check it out lest you suffer Oyashiro-sama's Curse!","May 17, 2015","true","19.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","3"

The original sprites were rather crude, but this makes a nice point of prettying it up. But more importantly, the story is immensely gripping and it really does become hard to turn away or put it down, so to speak.\n\nI for one, have watched the anime that was based off the visual novel, and even though I've experienced the masterpiece that is Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (and Kai, the second season), the story is still as gripping, chilling, and as amazing as ever.\n\nThere should be about 3 more chapters that will conclude the 4 Question Arcs of the series, and then 4 more new chapters that will conclude the Answer Arc for the series, to which I am thoroughly looking forwards to!","May 19, 2015","true","13.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

That it comes with a completely revamped translation (as MangaGamers old translation was filled with bad grammar and formating) and new sprites is just icing on the cake.\n\nStory: Since Higurashi is a Sound novel the story has to be the most important part of the game and it does that magnificently. While the first hour or so of the game is rather slow it then quickly opens up and becomes one of the most paranoia- and horror-filled experiences I have ever read (perhaps only eclipsed by the first arc of it's spiritual sequel, Umineko no Naku Koro Ni). But a note for those who are used to flag based Visual novels where there are occasionally dialogue options that often effect what happens next and what ending you will receive, Higurashi does not contain any choices. Higurashi is instead what is called a kinetic mystery novel where you, as the player, are supposed to read the story and through the hints provided in this chapter and the the other chapters in the so called questions arc (ch. 1-4 with 5-8 being called the answer arc) try to solve the mystery. So, don't expect any choices but instead, pick up a pen and paper, fire up your brain and try to solve this strange case.\n\nCharacters: Characters have always been the greatest part of Ryukushi's writing and the characters in the Higurashi is no exception. While, in the beginning, the characters look like normal people if slightly strange and eccentric, as the story moves forward you will get a whole new view of them as the darker parts of their backstories and natures are revealed. And while there are many side characters that doesn't get that much development (or even a sprite) almost everyone else receives at least one chocking reveal and many of the villains are also shown to have at least one sympathetic side to them.\n\nArt: In many Visual novels the art is usualy ranging from decent to fantastic, When They Cry usually put itself on the lower part of the curve. The background is just real photographs (taken in the Japanese village Shirakawa-go) with a photoshop filter and the original sprites are very crude. But in my opinion that doesn't really matter as the main focus is the story, and the characters are mostly there to help you get forward, make you care about them, and in a few cases give out a few laughs with how they look. But as I said above this re-release comes with new character-sprites which the MangaGamer team worked on in coordination with 07th Expansion. I think they look really good and captures the original quite well but on the other hand they do contrast a bit against the background and sadly aren't are expressive as the original sprites (compare Rena's new shocked/embarrased sprites with the originals).\n\nMusic: As the name Sound novel implies the music is one of the primary aspects of the game. But while the music in this re-release is better then the one used in the original release (as MG couldn't get permission to use it) it is still rather weak compared to the series from ch. 4 and onward. But that doesn't mean it's bad, it's just not as good as it is later on. The music often fits perfectly with the scenes and the scary scenes are often made even worse by showing that silence is often even more scary than a scare chord, by removing the music during those scenes.\n\nGameplay: As I noted earlier, there is no gameplay at all in this ''game''. The closest is that after every few chapters a couple of TIPS are opened that you can read. But while you can skip them it is strongly suggested that you read them as they are side stories that are either background material, cryptic discussions or contains further hints to the mystery.\n\nFinal thoughts: Of all the stories I have ever read, When They Cry is probably my all time number one and while I consider Umineko to be slightly better, Higurashi is still really good. So if you either want to try out what a Visual novel actually is or just want a good and engaging mystery story with well written characters and a amazing soundtrack in a new and interesting format, pick up this game.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou are invited to solve this strange case. Will you pick up the challenge or will you give up and leave it unsolved. And if you do pick it up will you succeed to find the truth or will you fail like so many others?\n\nWelcome to Hinamizawa.","May 15, 2015","true","5.8"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","0"

I personally love to read fantasy books, and enjoy the anime style of drawing, but very few actual animes because they tend to not have any real depth to them. I requested a friend of mine for a suggestion, and he gifted me this. I just downloaded and started it up without getting into any reviews or anything other than reading that it was a "sound novel," which I had no idea what that was nor did I really care.\n\nGetting into the game itself, I was a little confused at the introductory chapter at the funeral, but that tends to happen where you don't fully understand the setup that is occuring. Getting into the second chapter, I got really ticked off really quickly at Rena because she appeared to be your typical "I can't do anything for myself" female character, which I can't stand. Thankfully, this was rectified soon after... With a Mike Tyson lightning punch to the face. Not exactly what I was expecting...\n\nContinuing for the rest of the opening chapters, the character development was far better than I was expecting. The characters all mesh well together, and it feels like a bunch of school age friends playing games together. While going throughout a normal day, there a few somewhat quirky things that happen, such as Rena going to the dump to dig out Colonel Sanders, but nothing is jarring. It actually flows pretty well, but these stories of something happening a few years ago being all hush hush seems a bit funny, as well as this Tomitake-san character snapping pictures of people out in the middle of nowhere. Dude's a super creeper for sure.\n\nThe game starts to go into the main plot by starting to hint at what happened in Hinamizawa a few years ago. Some guy got dismembered? Damn, thats kinda scary. One of the perpetrators disappeared and they can't find him? Those police are definitely incompetent. And then the Watanagashi comes, the yearly ritual to praise the diety protecting the city. The anniversary of the dismemberment, where somebody has been killed every year since then. Totally not sketchy. It's obviously been a coincidence every year... Right?\n\nThe next day, everything is normal, everybody is having fun at school doing club activities. We've set up a brilliant plan with Rena to win, we just need a minute to set it up... Wait, there's somebody to see us? What happened last night?!? And my friends might be involved????? Yea, right. I'm going to believe some old guy I've never seen before over my friends. Ha. Cute. But they have been hiding some things from me... Maybe I should be a little leery about this. I'll just go talk with Rena a little bit after class.\n\nIf I had actually had a choice in this matter, it would qualify as the greatest mistake I had ever made. The music up until this point had been nice and fitting for all portions of the game. Walking and talking with Rena a little bit, it just goes dead silent. Rena asks a question, and I dodge it a little bit.\n\nLIAR!\n\nThis is where the demons came out in full force. I don't think I've ever been more scared than I was in that moment. I was terrified every time that the music went silent from here on in, and every time Oyashiro-sama surfaced, I was filled with the sense of dread of what horrors were coming. But I couldn't just leave it there. I had already become so invested in these characters, they meant something to me, I had to know that everything would be okay. They couldn't be involved in these mysterious deaths. They are my friends! This is all a hoax, right? RIGHT?!?!\n\nAnd this is just the prologue chapter of the story. I can't stand the horror genre across all mediums, but there's just something about Higurashi When They Cry that is calling to me. Are the Higurashi trying to tell me something? Are the victims trying to warn me to stay away? All I know is that I must go back to Hinamizawa.

I loved it and I will be thinking about it for a long, long time, but I had to play it in small doses because it was too intense to play for more than a few minutes at a time. If the next chapter ever becomes available, I intend to grab it immediately.\n\nThis is not a game. It's a story, like a novel but with sound and music to enhance the mood, and it is excellently effective. It usually lets you advance the text of the story at whatever pace you choose, but sometimes it takes control and makes you pause in anticipation before revealing the next line. That may sound frustrating, but it is only done rarely and only when it makes the story better. You could never get these sorts of amazing effects from reading a mere novel. I strongly recommend that everyone try Higurashi.\n\nThe art is fine and does what it needs to do. It would be nice if there were more poses and more backgrounds to more closely follow the story, but that's a trivial issue. On the other hand, it would not have been a trivial issue if the art had not been upgraded from the original version of the game. During the game you have the option of flipping between the new art and the original art, and the original art is terribly goofy and unacceptable. If I need to play the next chapter using the original artwork, then it's not worth playing. Fortunately the new art is in a clean and conventional style without huge cartoonish exaggerations.\n\nThe new art takes away Mion's gun. I never understood why Mion wore a gun; it's such a bizarre fashion choice and removing it can only improve the story.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing experience that fixes the serious flaws in the original version and turns it into a masterpiece.","June 12, 2015","true","15.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

To top it off, while this does have its own conclusion, it is still part one of a larger story and leaves you with a bunch of dangling plot threads, which is infuriating when the future translations are ??? off.\n\nI feel like I'm half-damning this when I say I would have preferred to just read this as a novel, but it really did get me to press on through, so it's not like it's the worst thing I've played in the genre.\n\n* Technically you can look at "additional documents/conversations" after certain chapters, but you make absolutely no plot decisions.

You can't tell from the screenshots, but Higurashi is a horror story.  It's disturbingly violent.  It's a heart-wrenching tragedy.  It's a murder mystery, and that's an understatement.  But at its core, Higurashi has a light that shines not despite the darkness, but because of it.  If you can stomach it, there's power here.\n\nIt's a testament to the power of Higurashi's story that a no-name indie VN with amateur art and processed photos for backgrounds managed to take off at all, let alone spawn regular adaptations, spin-offs, and updated re-releases for the past 13 years.\n\nIf you can read Japanese AND already know the story, get Higurashi Sui.  For everyone else, this is the one.  It's the only release with both updated sprites and the original story structure.  The branching format of the console releases adds a new perspective, but it's best to experience it straight first.  It's listed as Higurashi Hou, so it should eventually include six bonus arcs beyond the core story.","May 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

An intriguing story based in 1980s Rural japan, and for a super cheap price. Even if you aren't into anime/japan stuff, this is still a must-have for anyone who enjoys mystery as a genre. To the outside viewer, it may seem like a cheap, dated visual novel, with a boring introduction and a somewhat strange setting, but the storytelling in this game makes it hold its own, and probably will for years and years to come.

How unprepared was I.\n\nI had absolutely no exposure to this series prior to playing Onikakushi, but what I found here was enough to dig into pretty much everything I could find that had 'Higurashi' attached to it.

This was acceptable in 2002 when the sound novel was originally released, but it comes off as extremely lazy in 2015.\n\nAs for what was updated, the new sprites are a mixed bag. There's so much space between everybody's eyes, this causes some character's faces to look very strange (Rika and Mion being hit the hardest by this). On the flip side, Satoko has never looked better (can't wait to backpeddle that statement when Tatarigoroshi comes out..). Rena's artwork is all on point as well (even though she really could have used a sprite with her holding her axe...), which is great, seeing how she has the larger role in this chapter.\n\ntl;dr get the ps3 patch and cry that you're paying MangaGamer $6 for an inferior chapter","June 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 67 of 117 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","67","117","5","7"

Higurashi is a top-notch mystery horror visual novel with very memorable characters and a story that keeps you guessing and thinking.

The rest will be released later on. But even just this first chapter is easily enough to get you hooked for now. And for that price? Yea, worth it.\n\nAlso, this is a remastered version of the original visual novel, with some new options, a new translation, new sprite art, etc. So even those of us who have already read the original can get plenty of enjoyment out of this one.\n\nWatched the anime? Still worth it, I can assure you. It's a different experience to read it in visual novel format. It provides more details on everything and the creepy/paranoia-inducing atmosphere is much more prevalent in the visual novel compared to the anime. In general, scenes tend to be more effective and powerful in this, and it feels more mysterious.

Personally, I wouldn’t mind a few more sacrifices; make scenes nicer by giving minor characters art and re-do the tacky, old background pictures. As it stands, however, this first chapter is a gripping entry into Hinamizawa’s mystery, best enjoyed by returning players and those who watched the anime.

There is an option to switch between the new and old art in the options menu.

It introduces an absolute horror classic to folks who think torrenting and hunting down worthwhile patches is a hassle, yet it also offers original Japanese text and Ryukishi's charming art to long-time fans.\n\n"Onikakushi" forms the prologue chapter to an episodic horror plot with a basic gist comprised of eight arcs, with a few bonus chapters strewn about throughout various media adaptations. We are introduced to the core cast of the series, with transfer student Keiichi Maebara at the center, and watch his carefree first weeks in the small and isolated village of Hinamizawa take an abrupt sinister turn.\n\nThe storytelling has the remarkable ability of building up the reader's feelings of affection torwards Keiichi's new friends, then holding one's heart in a steel grip that agonizingly, slowly tightens as strange, creepy, then outright horrifying events begin to pile up. I don't speak Japanese, so I can't judge if the translation is accurate, but it certainly does convey the tense atmosphere this VN is so famous for. On top of that, there's nothing to complain about regarding grammar and spelling, and it retains elements of Japanese culture (such as honorifics) while staying comprehensible for non-anime fans.\n\nThe new art struck me as a tad bit too cutesy at first -  Rena looks very, very young - but is easy to get used to. For those who can't stand it, the original game art can be toggled in the options, but I'll say that it is more of an acquired taste than the remake art. The game's overall presentation is simplistic and focuses on the text, with atmospheric but non-obtrusive music and averagely expressive sprites supporting the mood.\n\nThere's not really any gameplay to this game, not even in the form of choices or stats as typical for Visual Novels - think of it as more of a picture book.\n\nIn a summary, you should give this game a shot if...\n...you're into tense, atmospheric horror with a tasteable dash of violence.\n...you like Japanese pop culture and have previously enjoyed other visual novels.\n...plot and storyline are of high importance to you in a game.\n...you enjoy reading.\n...you're a fan of the franchise and want to support the creators.\n\nThis game is likely not your thing if...\n...you like to be active during gameplay or influence the story.\n...you're sensitive to horror, squeamish about descriptions of violence or plain don't like the genre.\n...you don't like reading long passages.\n...you're very impatient, since you'll have to wait for the other arcs to be released to receive closure on the plot's questions.","May 23, 2015","true","10.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

In fact, this is my first time experiencing the Higurashi series, except for a few short clips that I've seen from the anime. I recently got into reading visual novels (even though this one refers to itself as a "sound novel". Even so, I'm pretty sure it counts as a visual novel), and I can say, they won't appeal to everyone, since many just want to play a game that's a game, and a book that's a book. However, I never took that much enjoyment in reading actual novels (I find it hard to pay attention while reading, usually), so a visual novel appeals more to me, since I'm required to click, which helps keep my attention.\n\nThe first 3-5 hours or so features little story, and mainly focuses on anime tropes. I personally didn't mind this section too much, since it got me to know the characters better. However, I can see how someone would take little enjoyment in this section of the "game".\n\nThe second half of the visual novel is where the story really gets started. I thought that this section was done very well.  I found myself surprised at how uncomfortable I could feel from mostly words, sounds, and also a few pictures. The atmosphere in this visual novel is done quite well in my opinion. I felt immersed in the village of Hinamizawa, even though all I had to do was click and read.\n\nAs soon as I was reaching near the end of this chapter, I knew that I wanted to read the next. Originally, I thought I would just go on to watch the anime, but now, I'm very curious to read more of the visual novel.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend buying this "game" if you are alright with just clicking and reading. If you are ok with that, get ready to be spooked m8.","January 8","true","10.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/310360/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Higurashi When They Cry - Onikakushi is the first chapter of the famous Higurashi visual novel that came out between 2002 to 2006 in 8 chapters in Japan, which was made by 07th Extension. More exactly, what we have here is updated translated version, this one released by MangaGamer in 2015. I will talk about versions a bit later, scroll down if you want to read on them. Original visual novel was also called sound novel for some reason, I didn't find any good reason for that. At least no good reason to keep calling it that.\nHigurashi is divided into 8 chapters: 4 for "questions" arc and 4 for "answers" arc. And epilogue. And bonuses. Yea, you get only the first chapter of the question mark here. Don't worry, it itself has 12 in-game chapters and is overall a good read. And I heard that all of those chapters basicly restart the main story and do "what if main hero did something else". They still recommend to read it in chronological order.\nIt also was released for PS2, PS3, Vita, NDS. Oh, and there was anime. And manga.\n\nThe story follows a Keiichi, a normal guy who transferred into the village Hinamizawa along with his family. There he is going to make new friends four girls and have everyday fun, getting from one anime trope to another, with mixture of silly fun and challenges. Life will be good. Enjoy it while you can.\n\nBecause it's not going to last for long and some crazy dark stuff will start happening halfway through. The first half of it is pretty much a build-up, so don't expect much of interesting going on. Not to say that there are no sinister things rearing it's ugly head in the first half, but you will have to endure through a whole bunch of usual anime harem tropes which go on for a while. Hopefully you enjoy such things. Like I do. Then it will work out even better. More effective.\n\nBecause after the halfpoint, you will get wrapped into things that fall into tags "mystery" and "horror" and the storyline of the Higurashi novels will want you to keep guessing what is 'actually' happening. Especially since this one can be called as prologue. Don't worry, no big jumpscares. Just maybe music stingers. Or shockers. Whatever you call those.\nOooookay, there are also graphic descriptions of deaths/wounds. Geezes.\n\nNow that I told you that it's awesome, let's see what I found about various versions. Original version was Japanese-only, so somebody had to translate it. Most notably, it had silly minigames in extra. It also has really silly looking character drawing, looking a bit like kids drawings compared to everything else.\nAnd so MangaGamers licensed and translated it around 2009-2010. However, aside from removal mini-games and such, they also had to replace some of the tracks with their own made. Something with licensing issues.\n\nAnd now they are redoing the translation for Steam releases. This time they managed to retain the soundtrack as is. Not only that, but they also drew new character sprites, the ones that can be serious. I mean, when you put male character and female girl together, you can actually see huge difference in their body build and height. Though I noticed how green-haired girl, Mion, has a handbag with what looks like a pistol in one of her outfits in original sprites, while updated don't show it. But this handbag is never mentioned in text, so I don't know what to think. Otherwise, go for updated. Oh, you can switch to original if you want.\n\nTranslation also seems to be funky. They say that it's improved however, over previous MangaGamer release. Like, for some reason they keep saying things like "-sana" after name which has no place in proper English translations. One of the sentences even had "(lol)" written after it. I also sometimes was confused at what line belongs to what character on screen. There are no voiceover in PC releases, you know. Also, protip: if you see line starting with "this old geezer" then it's green-hairer girl, Mion, refering to herself.\nOtherwise, it does the job fairly well.\n\nThough, also should mention that Japanese world of gaming in meanwhile were doing their own things, porting this VN to consoles. Starting with PS2, then Nintendo DS and then over to PS3 and Vita, they brought voiceovers, their own updated art and some neat stuff, like special drawn scenes. Even adding new additional chapters. I even heard that some incorporated all the chapters together to act as interactive novel. Depending on choice, you will go either through one or another chapter. They also had backgrounds changed and updated for widescreen.\nSadly, it all remains untraslated and unpublished in the west.\n\nAnime is also the way that people in the west found out about Higurashi. Though from what I heard it cuts up some parts from VN and instead of suspension and atmospheric build-up focuses on shock and gore. Not to say that novel wasn't descriptive about wound, but gee. No care, sounds a bit like teenager bait if you ask me. Or at least VNs sound preferably.\n\nOverall, this visual novel is hot and cool and Steam version is cool and hot. At least when viewed as far as translated or PC releases go.","February 6","true","25.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","1"

Not just because of the violence, but because it invests time in developing the characters and then makes you watch as the peaceful life they enjoy slowly slips away from them despite their best efforts.\n\nIf you enter the world of Higurashi and catch the Hinamizawa fever, I guarantee it'll leave you itching for more.","May 23, 2015","true","12.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Things are set in motion to snowball into the dark terror you expected, and when you get there it will (at least, the idea is that it will) carry that much more impact because of the time taken showing you what the characters are like when they aren't bludgeoning each other to death as well as what brought them to that point.","July 13, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Higurashi is different because it doesn't take "generic" horror cliches such as extreme amounts of gore or jump scares. If you've watched the anime or played the VN already, yes, I agree, it does take a while to get to the scary parts. But the build-up and the contrast makes it worth it. If you went into this game blind without even reading the description, you might even start to think it's just another romance visual novel. The lightheartedness of the beginning contrasting with the slowly ascending terror makes reading and continuing addicting.\n\nI played the game with the voice patch installed. However, Higurashi is by origin a sound novel, where just the sounds alone are capable of giving you a great experience. But do yourself a favor and install that voice patch anyway. The voices help bring the characters to life, and it helps set the mood with the cute to evil switches.\n\nIf you've never experienced Higurashi When They Cry before, you're in for a ride. One playthrough won't be able to satisfy all the countless questions going through your head after the ending. Read it again and live in the world of Hinamizawa again, and try to figure out the mystery yourself and where things went wrong. Before you know it, you'll finish the game at 3 am, and not sleep until 11 am in fear of Rena waiting at your door.","December 15, 2015","true","46.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game refers to itself as a prologue and there is too much left unknown by the end that I don't really feel like I have any sense of closure.\n\nWith only two parts of the eight parts translated and on STEAM at this time, I'm not sure it would be wise for those on the fence to jump on this now.  I might suggest waiting until more have been released and then trying the game when you can either get a bundle or the first couple on sale.\n\nThe art itself is great, the characters really likeable and interesting and the mystery is an interesting one, but I'm not sure the game knows what genre it wants to be.  The first 2/3's or so is an enjoyable slice of life Visual Novel with the last portion acting as a thriller.  I state thriller here because I went in expecting horror, but it really wasn't as scary as I had hoped or expected (and I'm not exactly the bravest when it comes to horror games).\n\nOne final piece is that the game isn't really a game in that it does not allow any interactions aside from advanced text and watching some mildly interesting extra scenes called "TIPS", so bare that in mind if you prefer something a little more active.  Even with all this said, I really enjoyed this Visual Novel and would recommend, but the recommendation is a lot more tepid once I've reached the "end" of this game.","January 7","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

But Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni managed to hit exactly the combination of creepy suspense. You start of as a transfer student in a rural village and join a club of all girls that play games. So much for anime tropes. The first part game focuses on introducing the characters and their antics. Then there is a cultural festival (moar tropes) and something bad happens. Gradually you become aware that there is something going on. The village is not what it seems...\nThey know. They know that you know. And they are coming for you!\n\nI knew little beforehand about the Higurashi series only that it was supposed to be one of THE visual novels. I was probably misinformed that it would be gory, but the game instead focuses much more on suspense, mystery and character driven creepyness.\nThe graphics are spartan, but the character sprites serve their purpose well. I liked the new redrawn one much more than the original ones (probably would have quit if there had been only the old ones), but the choice is yours.\nThe music was my personal highlight. There are not many tracks, but they hit the spot every time.\nThe story is well written and believable (for horror games). There are however no choices or alternate routes, so there is not much replayability.\n\nAlll in all, a definite recommendation!

Higurashi takes another path: psychological horror. And that was a wise choice because Ryukishi07 (the original author) knows, what he does.\n\nFirst off the story and characters. They're both great. While this is just the prologue for the series, it introduces the main characters, characterizes them more or less (each chapter is dedicated to one/two) and builds up an incredible atmosphere. The story is set in Hinamizawa, where around 1000 people live, and is a rural area. Not crowded places, but barely crossed streets are  a common thing. The protagonist, Keiichi Maebara, moves into this town. He goes to a school, that has about 20 students, and befriends some of them. Seems like a light atmosphere. But it isn't. An incredible aspect of Higurashi is the sudden turn of mood, that surprises and overwhelms you. You think, you can relax and nothing happens, but in the next moment, you're scared to death. While this may sound exaggerating, if you're focused on the story, you will experience these moments. And this level of writing is on another level. You will experience even more overwhelming developments during the next chapters, but that is another story.\n\nThe mood is supported by the music. While it's not that great, it expresses the mood in a way, that the reader feels like that too. Unfortunately, there is no voice acting even though this is a reworked chapter. That's really disappointing.\n\nThe sprites are another noticeable aspect. In my opinion, they fit the story, aren't too crazy, but aren't too normal as well. Some sprites will even send a chill down your spine (yes, I'm looking at you, Rena).\n\nWhile the chapter will leave you with nothing but questions, the chapter itself is well executed. I can recommend it to every fan of the Higurashi anime series as well as thriller fans. See it for yourself. It's worth its money.","January 14","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

For those who loved the anime/manga series, this will be fun to play.\nDetail:\nPros:\n+ Can switch between the new and old artwork\n+ New artwork is very nicely done.\n+ Lots of save spots for your game.\n+ Can switch between English and Japanese.\n+ A VN that has lots of hours of play. (played 10.2 hours)\n+ Had 12 chapters/parts to go through to get to the end.\n+ An exciting story that keeps you glued in for most of it.\n+ Atmosphere conveyed quite well through music and art.\n+ Achievements ,that if you enjoy the story, are quite easy to get.\n+ Learn more info through T.I.P.S\n+ No grammatical errors found from first read through.\n+ For those who love the anime, will be a treat :)\n+ Different poses for characters.\n+ Game isn't really expensive\n+ Writing is not bad :) Goes into fairly good detail\n+ (Depending on your own perspective: Has no Voice Acting)\n\nCons:\n-Based off of other VN I've went through, would have been nice to have those full images to see instead of just individual character poses all the time. Think that would have made a scarier element to it than the blotch of blood on the right of the screen.\n-Can become confusing whose talking since text goes over artwork.\n-  Felt Keiichi's progression into insanity went slightly too quick into beleiving Oyashiro-sama's curse and going against his friends.\n-Cicada noise drove me nuts after a bit.\n-A lot of reading, though I would have liked choices I could make like other VNs. Just reading through the story, which isn't that bad for me personally, but could be not as good to others who may want to play.\n- BG is weird looking. Some looks like it was taken with a photograph then blurred weirdly and than put a photoshop filter on it.\n- (Depending on your own perspective: Has no Voice Acting)\n\nVerdict:\nFans: If you love the Higurashi anime and/or manga.

That means that there is no gameplay, the entire thing is just a bunch of text, with pictures of characters and the background to help illustrate it, topped off with sound effects. If you hate reading, kinetic/visual novels are not for you.\n\nHigurashi has a total of 8 main chapters. This is only the first one. The rest are slowing going through the translation process. Some chapters relate to others, so if this is your first experience with Higurashi, I'd almost recommend for you to wait until all 8 are released before you read them all so you won't forget some of the details.\n\nHigurashi is a horror/mystery. The protagonist moves to rural Japan from the city and is adapting to his new life in a town where the population is so small that his school consists of one classroom with students in many different grades. He befriends four of them and they do a bunch of things kids do, but slowly the protagonists hears more and more disturbing rumors about his new village. As if to heighten his fears and paranoia, eventually, people start dying.\n\nHaving read my fair share of Christie and Doyle, I will say that the mystery in Higurashi is top notch. While it's not your typical closed circle murder mystery (which is the theme of the author's second work, Umineko), the author does leave just enough clues here and there for intelligent readers to figure out the truth behind the events in Higurashi. If you're like me and couldn't figure it out despite all the hints, that's ok too. The last few chapters act as an "answer key" and reveals the truth for you.\n\nTL;DR: if you enjoy reading mysteries, Higurashi is definitely for you, though I may recommend waiting till all 8 main chapters are translated.","May 16, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even knowing the story beforehand, the horror parts got my heart racing and had me checking over my shoulder for Oyashiro-Sama. In my opinion this is the best medium to tell the story since it adds so much detail and perfect atmosphere. It's a spectacular blend of cute, fun humour and bone-chilling supernatural mystery. I am looking forward to the other chapters and hopefully Umineko series as well.\nOnly thi ng that I noticed could improve my experience is a back button to rewind a scene.

Seeing the story through to the end will keep your interest piqued and waiting anxiously for chapter 2. Despite the dark ending, there is a scene afterwards in the extras section that provides some much needed denouemont.\n\nHigurashi is not so much a game, or even a choose-your-own-story game, but a strictly linear narrative (a Kinetic Novel). That might sound disapointing to some, but it uses surprisingly effective writing, artwork, music, and sound effects to balance both levity and growing tension. It even controls the pace of the dialogue to ensure that jokes and terrifying revelations are delivered at the right moment.\n\nI don't want to describe what's going on because discovery is part of the fun of a good mystery or horror story, so I'll leave you with some of the things I learned from Higurashi:\n\n- A happy childhood is a wonderful thing to have. Cherish it while you have it, or at least help others experience it.\n- Life is like a game you play where the other players don't give you all the rules up front, including the following rule.\n- If your opponents set out to win by any means necessary, you must match them.\n- Even the greatest of fortunes can be reversed instantly.\n- Today's adversaries can become tomorrow's friends, and vice versa.\n- Fight with all your might.\n- Always think outside the box and around the problem.\n- When someone warns you that you are asking too many questions, you just might be. Ask yourself if your life depends on you NOT knowing the answers you seek.\n- Girls are scary when they get mad. DON'T ---- WITH THEM. (or, Hell hath no fury...)\n- Know who your real friends are. Stick by them when they need you. Forgive them when they've hurt you, for your sake as well as your own.\n- If you think either that people are out to get you, that you are cursed by a supernatural force, or that you're simply having a psychotic episode, drop what you're doing and get help.\n\n\nI dare you to play this game late at night, in the dark, when you should be asleep...","August 5, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunbofu/recommended/310360/","sunbofu","SunBofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunbofu/","129 products in account","I'm going to take two approaches with this review: first, as a fan of the series reviewing this particular installment. Then, as someone who'd never played a visual novel before and didn't know what I was getting into.\n\nPart 1:\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, you'll find this to be a rather faithful adaptation of Onikakushi-hen ("Demoned Away Chapter"), the first story arc from the series. Everything is there exactly as it was in MangaGamer's previous release, albeit with a new translation, new features, and a new presentation (character sprites in particular).\n\nTranslation:\nThe translation of the game is greatly improved over MangaGamer's previous release. The use of honorifics and wordplay is preserved from the original Japanese, and there are only a few minor typographical or grammatical errors that are fairly easy to miss. Character voices are distinct and easy to pick out, even without the use of characters' names as headers to tell you who's talking. For instance, Satoko tries to make herself sound smarter than she is, Rena has very distinct verbal tics, and Ooishi's roundabout way of talking is very distinctive as well. Those few typos aside, I have no complaints about the translation.\n\nFeatures:\nThere's a lot of neat features in this release. Not only can you change the resolution (while the choices are limited, it's still appreciated), but you can also change back and forth between Japanese and English text at any time, or the original sprites and the new, updated ones exclusive to this release (more on those in the next section). That being said, this is just a rerelease of the original Onikakushi-hen. If you've played the console versions of the arc, you won't find any of the extra content (for instance, in the console versions of Onikakushi-hen, you can actually choose how Keiichi responds in certain scenes, which is a small but neat change).\n\nArtwork:\nThe original backgrounds are preserved, but while they have their charm, they clash quite a bit with the new sprites. The sprites, however, are perhaps the most controversial aspect of this release. Having played the game, I can say that overall, they started to grow on me. Yes, certain aspects of the design are quite different from how I'm used to seeing the characters portrayed. For instance, Rika's hair and facial expressions are quite a bit different from how she appears in the original sprites, the anime and manga adaptations, and the visual novel's other versions' sprites. Ooishi is a bit more rotund, too. Others, like Rika and Satoko, look just about how I expected. I wasn't sure if I liked Mion's at first or not, but by the time I finished, it had grown on me. Still, if you prefer the other versions' sprites, there are easy workarounds, but I'd recommend giving the new sprites a spin first, just to see if you get used to them, too.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of the series, does this warrant a buy? For about $5, I have to say yes. A lot of work obviously went into this release.\n\nSo, what about people who aren't sure if they want to play a visual novel about horrible, horrible murder?\n\nPart 2:\n\nHigurashi When They Cry (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni) is a visual novel, which means that the story is told through a mix of text and static artwork (in this case, sprites against backdrops, with occasional visual effects for mood). Some visual novels (and even different versions of this particular story) occasionally have branching paths, but this is the first of many chapters in the Higurashi series, and this particular release is rather linear aside from supplemental scenes that are unlocked as you progress through the story (called "TIPS"). These scenes shed light on aspects of the story, typically from outside from the main character's point of view.\n\nSo, this particular series is psychological horror and involves a series of mysterious deaths and disappearances. There are graphic textual depictions of murder and violence, as well as sound effects to demonstrate these acts, but there is actually very little visual gore (just some blood splatters on the screen occasionally). If a narrative description of fairly brutal violence doesn't bother you but the sight of it does (like is sometimes shown in the anime and manga adaptations), the visual novel shouldn't be too problematic for you. But make no mistake about it: beneath the cute-looking characters is a story written for mature audiences.\n\nThe story doesn't start out violent, though. You learn about the village of Hinamizawa from the eyes of Keiichi, a teenager who's the new resident of the area. Keiichi's new friends are a driving force behind the story, and in this arc, the story focuses on Keiichi, Rena, and Mion. Paranoia, suspicion, distrust, and friendship seem to be the central themes beneath this particular arc.\n\nI never played a graphic novel before Higurashi, but its interesting cast and premise stuck with me. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit despite not being much of a horror fan. If you're curious about visual novels but aren't interested in sexual content, this is a great series to jump into. Also, if you find you have a favorite character: just because something happens to them in this particular chapter doesn't mean they won't be in the next one.","May 19, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No one knows why this is…but it only happens each year after the event. Will you be able to find out who or what lead these tragic events?\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nWith its improved and updated graphics, it sure looks better than before and it stands up with today’s standard of anime drawings. They didn’t attempt anything new here and its nothing impressive. Also, most of the background art are just real life pictures with filters over them; this is fine but it looks kinda weird in some places especially when it’s used many times over and over again.\n\nStoryline: 9/10\nA very slow start, but it eventually gets to the point halfway through the novel. They’ll start telling you about ‘the curse’, past events that happened before you moved in and more about the characters themselves. This eventually leads you to start wondering if the mysterious deaths were done by humans…or by the curse, or maybe both…you wonder…\n\nSound: 6/10\nIt could’ve been better really, some of the music tracks are the same and are played repeatedly in many of the scenes which was kinda annoying to hear after a while. But that’s not to say the music is bad, they’re ‘okay’ for the most part; just not the best.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nIt took me way longer to complete this 5-10 hour VN, took me 24 hours but it was totally worth all that hours. In terms of gameplay, you have the basic menu options and you also get to choose if you want to play with the old graphics or with the new and updated one. The game crashed a few times so make to save often, there are minor translation errors but nothing too big to affect your experience.\n\nPrice: 10/10\nThey are only asking for £4.79 here, go and pick it up now and read one of the most anticipated horror mystery VN there is. You can also pay £9.99 for both the first and second chapters.

I can fix it by playing in windowed mode and maximising and restoring the window whenever it happens, so it's fine. I'm impressed it even ran at all on this potato.\n\nYes, I have a gaming PC, but I played this while moving to a new house and it was in a box somewhere, only having this game to keep me entertained. It did its job well.\n\nInsta-buying chapter 2 when it comes out.","June 9, 2015","true","19.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each telling is the same story, but added details and different end results. This first chapter gives  you a background of the story and each character, and later chapters fill in the holes and go into more details about the mystery of Higurashi.\n\nIf this VN seems slow and  you feel like you want to stop playing it, I suggest watching the anime version instead, as the story is well worth it. It is a story that you can enjoy reading multiple times as the second time through you pick up many things you would miss.\n\nIt is a VN so there is only reading.\n\nEdit: After rewatching the anime, the VN is better, has a lot more details in it.","May 23, 2015","true","12.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Plus the 8 chapters of Umineko no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni - Chiru\n\nTo all newcomer, this novel doesn't serve it's story in the standard way as all novels does, but it split up the story into different pieces. For each chapter (which happens in a parallel universe in the very same date), the same event happens at the usual time, but some part of the event will be different, and a small piece of clue will be added into the story in some strange way, and it is the reader that have to find those clue and try to piece together their own version of story. The chapters in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni are called "The Question Arc", this is the challenge handed out to all readers, once you completed your investigation, then you shall brace yourself for the up coming "The Answer Arc"...

One slice of life, please~~\nHowever, as the story progresses, the underlying shadow of the coin presents itself, and the issues of trust, friendship and the regards of one's life, merged with questionable superstition and a mysterious climax conclude this question arc, leaving the reader hungry for more.\n\nAt this point one may have already known this, or mayhaps watched the anime too. That being said, it should not repulse you from this Novel. The folks at MangaGamer did a nice job in the sprite remaster, and the same splendid quality of everything else remains. The main enjoyable factor of the Novel is such that it puts you in the shoes of the main character, rather than being an observer of events when compared to, say, watching the anime, leading to an indellible experience. If so desired, notes have been released to help patch the game with voice acting from the Playstation 3 port, which may enhance the pleasure of reading.\n\nMuch like Tsukihime and Touhou, these doujins did more than anyone could imagine and have become the powerhouses of Japanese media today, justifiably so.\n\nA horror that has no jump scares and no gimmicks but relies solely on its plot, music and ability to capture its reader so vividly making him look around and gently scratch his neck is a 10/10 in my book.","August 18, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The first 30% is mind-numbing drivel. How do they expect readers to get to the real story, by sitting through that?  My first VN before this was Sword of Asumi.  It may have been a ridiculous detective case to figure out.  Still, there were choices to be made in that story to make it interesting.  Higurashi is a spacebar VN--no choices.\n\nI can forgive some of the translation problems.  The older female student kept referring to herself as "this old man"--a cultural colloquialism?\n\nStill, punctuation should be better than a third-grader could do.  There is a reason why we invented the quotation marks.  The MC talks to himself many times and quite a few times quotation marks were not used when he was speaking out load.  Also, when 5 people are speaking in a room, you need to indicate who is speaking; otherwise, it becomes very confusing as to who is saying what.\nSat: "This"\nRena: "That"\nTell me who is talking. "This" "That" "and more."  How does the reader know that the same person is talking?  This is editing that could have been done by a sixth-grade editor.  Hire one next time.\n\nUgh. Skip the Prologue: All-Cast Review Session. They pretend to be a book club discussing the story, whether a curse was logically involved.

I'm not into slice of life at all so it was taking me a long time to read through this part. After the Watanagishi festival (I probably butchered the spelling) the storyline REALLY picks up. The storyline takes such a dark turn that I thought I was reading Saya no Uta (which is the darkest VN I have ever read) for a bit.

Since then there's been seven more chapters of the core story, ten chapters of spin-offs and additions, ports to Nintendo DS, PS2, and PS3, a 2-on-2 fighting game, two audio drama CDs, fifty TV and ten direct-to-video episodes of anime, thirty-eight volumes of manga, seventeen books, and two live-action movies.\n\nThis is that original visual novel, with new art in an attempt to make it less goofy-looking.\n\nThere's a lot of reasons why this series blew up into a multimedia juggernaut, but it's one of my favorite stories for a simple reason: I hate it when a series tries to set up some massive, overarching mystery, but they're just making it up as they go along. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ you Lost and Battlestar Galactica. This is the antithesis of that. The first four chapters (of which this is the first) set up a complex, twisted mystery, then the last four chapters solve it. Everything pays off because it was all planned from the start. That guy at the table in Tokyo (who goes by the internet handle Ryukishi07) did a better job than Hollywood usually can.\n\nThe quality of this particular release is a little uneven. I liked how the old, childish art contrasted with the events and tone of the story. The new art feels too slick and maybe a little too sexy. This is a horror story about kids; it's important that they look like kids. On the other hand, at higher resolutions the old art looks like crap, and the new art isn't as bad as I originally feared from the preview images. The big disappointment is the new English translation. The old translation was clunky and had some real groaner lines, but the new translation has issues with stilted and overly literal language and some weird affectations (are they trying to make Satoko sound like a stereotypical southern belle or something? wtf?).\n\nOverall, though, you should buy it, read it, and just put up with the stilted language and Mion's ridiculous boobtastic posture.","May 16, 2015","true","37.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It consists of 8 episodes, each of them takes about 15-20 hours to read. You are Maebara Keiichi, a 16 years old high school student who moves to a town called Hinamizawa with your parents. You quickly become accustomed to your new school and your new friends are all really nice to you. But nothing that appears to be good will last very long, there's something wrong with this town. As the story progresses you find out that this town, Hinamizawa, has a very dark history, every year, on the same day, someone gets murdered almost like a ritual. But the scary thing is, all victims have one thing in common, they were not from Hinamizawa, they were outsiders, just like you.\n\nHigurashi is a really good example of how much you can do with the visual novel medium outside of the dating-sim genre. Reading a suspenseful story with thrilling sound effects and music is a really great experience. If you enjoy reading or if you're trying to get into visual novels then Higurashi is definitely a great choice.","May 28, 2015","true","20.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

I've loved this series for years, and have always wanted to play the games, so I was looking forward to giving them a go. What did I get though? A boring read along.\n\nThis visual novel has barely any visuals at all. There are no cgs and very few variations in the character's artwork, making everything feel uninteresting and bland. If you got this for the murder, you're going to be disappointed. That is, assuming you actually sit for like... five hours to get to it.\n\nThe game professes to you of its difficulty when you start it up, and I have to ask... what exactly is so difficult about it? Sitting through how humdrum it is??? Seriously, there is nothing hard about this. You play absolutely no part in this story at all, there are no choices to be made by you. You're reading an oddly formatted book. I have no idea how this is a game. I have no idea how this is a visual novel either, really. A picture book has more visuals to it than this cheap thing does.\n\nThere are so many versions of these games, and I understand the original version had little content to it design wise, but that was only made by two people. I don't think this one has the same excuse. Why couldn't they at least stick in some cgs from the other versions??? Give us something to look at other than static characters and stock images with a PS filter over them!\n\nThe fact that they updated the character artwork isn't even a plus because it doesn't look that great. The anatomy is... terrible, especially on Mion. The old art has its own anatomical issues, but at least it has some charm to it. The new stuff just feels soulless and stiff.\n\nI'm going to try and play it to completion, but only because I don't want my thirteen bucks to go to total waste. :I\n\nHonestly, you're better off just watching the anime or reading the manga. Or learning Japanese and playing the Playstation or DS versions.","May 8","false","4.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I love Higurashi and it's one of my favorite animes of all time, but the game as it is now, is almost unplayable. The backgrounds are not appealing at ALL and the text and 'text box' is way too large. I would rather they use anime-style backgrounds as well as actual text boxes with text that fits and moves on line by line rather than keeping paragraphs upon paragraphs on screen. Anyway, the patch is amazing and even though it doesn't fix the text problem, the background graphics give the game a MUCH more professional feel, and the addition of voices makes it so that the text doesn't feel so... clunky. Despite my complaints, I was beside myself with excitement when I saw this game was coming to Steam and appreciate the effort taken in making it. I just wish it'd been more polished.","September 3, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoestar/recommended/310360/","hoestar","rofflingwaffle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoestar/","223 products in account","To start with, I should mention that I knew the gist of the story for this chapter from watching the corresponding episodes of the anime series so that may have impacted on my experience of the mystery.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of Keiichi Maebara, a boy who recently transferred to the quiet village of Hinamizawa. About half of the story deals with his daily life, and the other half deals with the mystery.\n\nI personally hated the setting of daily life part of the game. I found most of the main characters annoying/uninteresting (most are along the lines of 'cute anime school girls who do cute things') and I pretty much couldn't connect with any of them other than the MC.\n\nOn the other hand, I found the setting for the mystery part of the game great. I liked the whole 'sleepy village in the hills where strange things are happening' aspect, and I thought the details that went into the background really helped to immerse you in the mystery.\n\nIt is where the two of these parts come together that really didn't work for me. I have heard that for some, the alternation between the daily life and the mystery parts of the story and the gradual merging of the two as the plot builds up is what makes the whole VN work really well. In my case, I found that the contrast was too great and every time the story switched from the mystery to the daily life part, it lost the momentum that had been built up. My experience with this was probably affected in some part because I did not enjoy/connect with the daily life part of the story. The build up of the mystery plot is also slowed because of the division into the two parts, especially at the beginning of the game, and I was tempted to give up early on because of the balance of the two is so heavily skewed (~90:10 early game) towards the daily life part early on to build the overall setting.\n\nArt:\n\nPretty average backdrops for a VN, but they do the job and help to visually flesh out the setting. The use of heavily-filtered photos helps the reader to connect for a mystery VN such as this, in my opinion, and the use of different filters also helps to add atmosphere to the mystery parts of the story. The updated sprites look alright but I thought they were not the most appropriate for the characters as they are portrayed. I saw some of the sprites from the PS3 version of the game and they fit a lot better.\n\nSound:\n\nThe text of the story is accompanied by some decent sound effects and music (at times used to great effect for suspense, etc). Wouldn't say that the soundtrack stood out too much.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe overall experience provided by this VN was alright/good (6/10), but I would not recommend this game as it just did not work for me. The actual portion of the game dealing with the mystery does not feel all that substantial, and it definitely does not feel worth it for someone who hated the daily life portion of the game.","February 20","false","6.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","5"

I waisted 6 hours of my life on a slideshow, that is all this is, it is not a game. I will say goodish things about this before I start, I could only recommend this to die hard I love everything because it is from this fans. I love Higurashi, it's an amazing series, but I didn't get what I expected from this and it could have been so much more than what they chose to do with it. That being said I do like the extra character input they give you after your done in extras even though it does break the 4th wall. This isn't a game. You don't get any choices, nothing is different from the anime. All you do is click through hours of dialog that brings nothing new to the table really. They don't even show a picture or anything for the scary parts. Part of what makes Higurashi so scary is the visuals, actually seeing the crazy and watching it happen. I would highly reccomend just watching the anime or if you do like to read, read the manga. This is a poorly transfered novel with a handful of blurred backrounds and character figures placed over that look like they were cut strait out of the anime. I say it's poorly done because even if you take it for the value of simply having something to read they never specify who is saying what so it's easy to get lost in their conversations at times.","November 6, 2015","false","6.0"," 8 of 50 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","8","50","0","6"

"A VN Higurashi game" Steam said? Well I'll be damned, this sounds like the perfect idea for Higurashi. I bet I could make the right choices for a happy ending with Rena on my first run, I imagined.\n\nBut in truth it's really not a game but a literal visual novel, with no form of interaction, options, endings and so on. While the elite fanatics will argue with me (as if I mocked Jesus Christ himself) that VN's don't have to be games and that I should practically be ashamed of ever wanting a Higurashi game. Just calm your ♥♥♥♥ people, just because I don't like this approach doesn't mean I dislike the franchise.\n\nListening to the hardcore fans yell at me still makes my neck itch as I had at first asked about the game. Something simple like "Okay I've read over 2 hours of story, when do I get the options?" only to get talked down to by uppity folks like a condescending mother talking down a kid. "Choices? What do you think your playing? Higurashi has no 'options' only story! God, why do these casuals always think a VN is a game?" Oh I dunno...because most of them are? In anycase I was pretty screwed as I had hit the 2 hour marker and couldn't get a refund. however it wouldn't be lady like of me to complain about wasted money.\n\nIn anycase while the story is great, I just don't like how it's being delivered. If you're like me at all, you'd think given how it is, Higurashi could make for a really awesome Choice making game. Frankly I'd rather just buy the Manga or Anime. More expensive sure but I'll be more satisfied with those. But also from what I heard this version is still pretty out of date, probably cause of some of the hideous renditions or something, I wouldn't know.\n\nI can't even give this a rating as it's not an actual game...but I still wouldn't recommend it unless you want to only read, you know, like a book. (Something else I just don't get...if you want to read, just buy a book.

I'm glad I had this "thing" for free because it is awfull. It is a visual novel with NO choice to make. I thought it would be a bit like telltales games. Or at least some choices between phrases... but no.\n\nIt really IS a sound novel (And a bad one for sure).\nBut even with this in mind... It's awful.\nA novel (badly written - maybe badly translated). I've "played" only 25 minutes. 25 minutes of small talk about the weather and other boring matters between some underdeveloped characters. Flat and repetitive dialogue. And the "sound" part is awful. It sounds like some free sound effects you can find on the internet.\nThis first chapter is supposed to be a 10 hours chapters. I suffered enough reading the first 25 minutes (Went to school, see 4 girls, than go see temple and picknick... That kind of things are nice in real life... and COULD be nice in a novel if the character had some motive of were interesting...)\n\nI see in that the comments are pretty positive about this "game". You might need to be already a fan of the manga to appreciate this. Anyways, that's just my honest opinion. If you wan't a nice story, grab a real book from a real writer.\nEdit: I've read a bit more (got "kyute"Colonol Sanders out, then the festival... yep having fun doing some "shaved ice eating race...")\n\n"...Shaved ice cream eating race ... I ... I can't !"\n"As long as you can melt it a bit with your body heat, then...!! It's...! so coOoOoold!!!"\nAnd next, a Cotton Candy stand ! "Why don't we do this one next!?

One that horror fans should expereince.This was my first entrance into the series. Not knowing what to expect, i found the first few few chapters of so to be pretty dry. It seemed like a slice of life sort of deal UNTIL the watanagashi. This is the turning point of the story and things start to hit the fan from there. CH.1 starts to sweep some characters under the rug and i was kinda intrested to see how they would play into the whole "♥♥♥♥ hitting fan" situation..but was sad to see they did not get much mention in the later chapters. The horror was pretty intense and the sounds lended themselves pretty nicely, adding diffrent audio distortions really tingled my spine and the overall mystery of what was going on made me keep reading. I kept reading only to be kinda disapointed by the ending..The ending wasn't bad (its pretty dark but not terrible at all) but it jut didn't answer questions that needed answers! After compleing the story the first time, you unock a little "cast party" thing, which was SUPER great to see and was a really nice pallete cleanser to the events that just hit me like a ton of bricks. (You will all see why if you choose to ake the purchase.)\nI really do recomed this VN to anyone who wants to a good mystery..but know that it's just a prolouge with little to no answers in it's conclusion and that there shall be more to come..whenever that may be..please let it be soon..(also that cast party was fantastic imo)","July 12, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The contrast of the normal, healthy lives of the main characters really makes it all the more disturbing as you progress through the story.

I played the original, so the updated graphics are very nice.  The only thing that annoys me so far is that they completely left out the main character's sprite, thus focusing completely on the girls... it's a bit sexist, bu you can't blame the visual novel for that (just those that remade it).\n\nI usually hate visual novels that don't give you choices or alternate endings... they're just boring.  And I'll admit, I wasn't too keen on the original Higurashi VN to start with because of that very reason.... but the story is SO good! There are some things in the visual novel that the anime and manga don't have, so it's nice to play through.  And hey, I've heard this story 100 times... and i"m still not bored with it!\n\nI believe HIgurashi is a treasure of a VN, and I highly recommend it to any anime fan.... or even to those who like horror mixed with mystery.","May 26, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just finishing the novel, I have to say I was quite pleased. Despite the occasional typo, I felt sucked into Keiichi's world, and got to experience a blow by blow of his journey to insanity, something that the anime tried to do, but didn't capture it like it did in the novel. I feel like the argument would be similar to something similar a Harry Potter movie - the movies were great, but they weren't able to squeeze everything the books had to offer. The visual novel fills in a lot of the small gaps that the anime, and in some cases, the manga goes over.\n\nTL:DR\nGreat for filling in small details that were left out in the anime/manga, get a more intimate point of view of Keiichi's descent to insanity.

It's not really a game now so a little weird to be on steam. But it is AMAZING. Very funny, well writen (at this point while I write this I'm awaiting the curse parts) to put it simply, it's entertaining.

CH.1 starts to sweep some characters under the rug and i was kinda intrested to see how they would play into the whole "♥♥♥♥ hitting fan" situation..but was sad to see they did not get much mention in the later chapters. The horror was pretty intense and the sounds lended themselves pretty nicely, adding diffrent audio distortions really tingled my spine and the overall mystery of what was going on made me keep reading. I kept reading only to be kinda disapointed by the ending..The ending wasn't bad (its pretty dark but not terrible at all) but it jut didn't answer questions that needed answers! After compleing the story the first time, you unock a little "cast party" thing, which was SUPER great to see and was a really nice pallete cleanser to the events that just hit me like a ton of bricks. (You will all see why if you choose to ake the purchase.)\nI really do recomed this VN to anyone who wants to a good mystery..but know that it's just a prolouge with little to no answers in it's conclusion and that there shall be more to come..whenever that may be..please let it be soon..(also that cast party was fantastic imo)","July 12, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the first chapter of a total of 12 chapters of the Higurashi no Naku koro Ni series. Comparing this to the anime, this is better in so many ways. I don't read manga (sorry) but the anime version of Higurashi is my favorite one so far, which means I've put quite a lot of thought behind this. Examples of why this is better than the anime is because of details. In the anime you get to know what the characters do and don't and such. In the visual novel you experience what they experience, you feel the emotions of the characters, you experience the story in a different way.

The Visual Novel is so much better.\n\nFirst, there's the content. If you're a fan of Higurashi, chances are you know there are around 8 arcs in the main story. This one covers the first arc, Onikakushi. While this means you'll have to wait for the other arcs (if they ever get released on Steam), this will eat up a good chunk of hours to finish. This is a lot more compared to the four episodes in the anime, which has around 4 episodes in its first arc.\n\nAlso, almost all of the content serves some purpose, whether its building relationships between characters, or showing the thoughts behind them that tear them apart. The story is pretty well-written, and while it does take some time for things to get serious, when it does, it's really good. I should probably also mention sound design. It contributes really well to the atmosphere, especially during some of the more tense moments. One moment you'll be hearing happy slice-of-life music, and the next, you'll be hearing ominous piano pieces with cicadas in the background. It's kind of hard to get immersed in the more frightening parts without sound, so I recommend not reading it on mute.\n\nUsually when this thing is on sale, it's around a dollar or two off, so there's no big need to wait until a sale hits. That being said, hope you enjoy it!","September 27, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is set to a great pace, and they don't just dive into the horror aspects right off the bat, like some games. I recommend this game very much, but there are and will be some gripes in my review, and those are mostly with the backgrounds not being updated and the UI not getting a new look. The backgrounds are from the first sound novel and as such give it a nostalgic value (for those who played the first game), it doesn't clash too badly with the new sprites, but updating them would've been nice, to at least match the updated sprites better. The UI is the same UI as the first game, it doesn't really need to be changed functionality wise more so get a cleaner and more modern look, its simple and effective (which I like) but giving it a newer, more polished and cleaner look would've been great. I have heard of a PS3 patch, but i dont like messing with/modding and possibly breaking the game (a far to common problem with New Vegas and other games, though to a different scale, considering this is a sound novel) and no voices are fine with me, it doesn't take away from any of the characters since i havent listened to their anime voices that much nor any of their updated game voices. No complaints about the sprites, love them. Would do the patch for the updated backgrounds, but then i have to do everything else in the patch, which i don't feel like doing. Glad i grabbed it on sale, but $5 maybe $6 max seems like a good price point for this sound novel series, hoping Mangagamer doesn't get too greedy. There are also very minor translation issues, does not take away from the game, but is a nuance when first seen. I would also now like to point out the weird use of censoring later in the game, not in the tips but in the actual dialogue or Monologue.\nand my time with it is because i keep leaving it open when I sleep xD.","October 31, 2015","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He made friends, He's well liked by the village, and he joined a cool school club. Then everything changes when he hears about an incident four years ago. And a series of events slowely turns the very life that keichii once knew upside down.\n\nThe characters in this story are really well designed in personality (Rena is my favorite :)) and the sound design is pretty good (though there is no fully voice acted characters which honestly would have helped for later scenes involving Rena) there is also plenty of background art too and the new models look very similar to the anime character designs which i consider a plus since its familiar territory.\n\nThat said, there are only two complaints i have and even then the game does a good job at countering them, one was the lack of a indication as to who was talking (name over the dialogue, colored text, etc.), but what saves this is how each character has a certain style to how they talk, making it easier to figure out who was talking.\n\nThe other complaint is the lack of CGI, something to help the audience imagine what had actually happened, but the scenes are described so vividely that they would almost feel out of place. Also, having watched the Anime also kinda helps.\n\nSeriously though, check this game out, it's only six bucks ;D","June 12, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have read the manga is probably the second best option as includes extra arcs (As well the DS, PS2, and Vita ports), but now is your chance to get the real deal.\n\nOnikakushi is probably the best introduction you can get of the series, but be aware that once you get into the answer arcs the story might slightly flop. Most Higurashi arcs start slow but gradually gets momentum and suspense, and that's probably one of their main charms. It might look at first as a silly harem game, but once the jiggles run out each character have their own background covered in the next arcs. Higurashi by default is 8 arcs, but excluding extra arcs in consoles and manga there's 1-2 extra PC arcs to clarify some final points.\n\nIf Higurashi gets supported enough I hope they also localize the superior Umineko (indirect sequel but also adds stuff to Higurashi) and other works like Higanbana and Rose Gun Days (Weaker but still enjoyable).","May 18, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel like the argument would be similar to something similar a Harry Potter movie - the movies were great, but they weren't able to squeeze everything the books had to offer. The visual novel fills in a lot of the small gaps that the anime, and in some cases, the manga goes over.\n\nTL:DR\nGreat for filling in small details that were left out in the anime/manga, get a more intimate point of view of Keiichi's descent to insanity.

All it has are still visuals, music, sfx and the text is written directly on the screen, from top to bottom, instead of the traditional text in a box. It has no choices, no alternate routes or endings. Some people might find that boring, but it isn't. For one, it is very long, It took me 18 hour to finish it and I read very fast. Second, the story is top-notch. You begin a story full of color and joy. Comedy is the main part of the story at the very beginning but all of that changes soon enough. A dark, gritty story emerges and you are plunged into a very in-depth thriller.\n\nIt is one of my favorite anime/manga series and I am glad we finally have the chance to play the original game it came from in English.

Since not all chapters are out on Steam yet, i recommend watching both main seasons of the Higurashi anime to get the full understanding of what's going on, and just to overall enjoy a very well crafted story!\n\nI don't think the visual novel is as good as the anime however, and that's mostly because of the rather shoddy translation. It's perfectly understandable, but its obvious that a lot of things were literally translated, so the structure of certain sentences isn't too good. Keiichi, the protagonist, also tends to ramble on and on in a lot of cases, and his questions about what's happening around him quickly become redundant, and i'd wish the game would move on sooner than it normally does with certain things.\n\nNevertheless, this is a good starting point for Higurashi newbies, just to get a little taste of what's Higurashi about, and maybe it'll encourage you to go and watch more of the story via different sources.

I loved the anime, and I loved the game. This is a game that all Visual Novel fans should at least check out.\n\nMeet Keichii (or as I lovingly refer to him as Keichii-Kun!!), keichii has moved to the small village of Hinamizawa and everything is going fine for him. He made friends, He's well liked by the village, and he joined a cool school club. Then everything changes when he hears about an incident four years ago. And a series of events slowely turns the very life that keichii once knew upside down.\n\nThe characters in this story are really well designed in personality (Rena is my favorite :)) and the sound design is pretty good (though there is no fully voice acted characters which honestly would have helped for later scenes involving Rena) there is also plenty of background art too and the new models look very similar to the anime character designs which i consider a plus since its familiar territory.\n\nThat said, there are only two complaints i have and even then the game does a good job at countering them, one was the lack of a indication as to who was talking (name over the dialogue, colored text, etc.), but what saves this is how each character has a certain style to how they talk, making it easier to figure out who was talking.\n\nThe other complaint is the lack of CGI, something to help the audience imagine what had actually happened, but the scenes are described so vividely that they would almost feel out of place. Also, having watched the Anime also kinda helps.\n\nSeriously though, check this game out, it's only six bucks ;D","June 12, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story starts off odd, but then has a ncie 'slice of school life' feel to it.   Well,  thats where it sets you up for thinking that this will be a nice, happy story with no horror at all.  But thats where it starts because about half way through, you learn of a few, mysterious events and eventually, certain people die and well, I can't say too much more since it would spoil things and even the ending of Ch 1 leading to Ch2 is a spoiler in itself.\n\n\nWhat Higurashi does best at, is telling a story that sets things up for future reference and by that, I mean that there are things that are said that might not seem like much, but will later get revealed as having a deeper or darker meaning to it.  I'm struggling to write a good review since I'm very very much a Higurashi fan since I've read all the VN for the main series, watched al the animes, and well yeah.\n\n\nAnyway, to put it short, Hgiurashi, is an amazing horror and psychological visual novel that is perfect for those who enjoy a good, kind of slow paced story.  The visuals of the characters are new and pretty, the sounds and music are kept from the original version, and thebackgrounds have been enhanced.   Its an amazing VN and anime that I highly HIGLY recomend watching it.  And if that doesn't get you hyped to read it, then watch this OP for the anime    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRtsIJXrhqc","October 21, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not really a game now so a little weird to be on steam. But it is AMAZING. Very funny, well writen (at this point while I write this I'm awaiting the curse parts) to put it simply, it's entertaining.

While the anime was an amazing adaptation of an intricate story, the source material still stands head and shoulders above.  All of the characters are more fleshed out, and given more attention.  There are jokes and club activity scenes that didn't make it into the anime at all.  The story and backstory of Hinamizawa is given way more detail.\n\nIf you've seen the show, or have read the VNs before, on reread, you'll notice so many hints and minor details that clue in at what's actually going on, and it's really satisfying.\n\nIf you're completely new to the series, you'll probably be confused about what's actually going on by the end of the game, but let me assure you that Higurashi is one of the few works I've seen where absolutely every loose-end is tied up by the end of the adventure.\n\nThe translation is really good, way better than the original localization MG put out years ago, and I'm glad they redid it.  The new sprites are also really pretty, and I actually prefer them to the PS3 versions.  The photo-filtered backgrounds don't bug me, but from what I understand, it's easy enough to patch in the PS3 backgrounds with a little googling.\n\nWhen I first saw that MangaGamer was going to charge $5-10 per part, I was a little skeptical, but since picking up and playing parts 1 and 2, I'm eager to throw my money at them for the rest.","December 25, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a horror/mystery, so there are dark themes in this game - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!\n\nSTORY: - May be Spoilers! - again, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\nThe story has a slow start (kind of) but definitely speeds up before the halfway mark.\nIt focuses on Keiichi Maebara, a 16-year old student who has moved to the rural village of Hinamizawa with his parents due to his father's work as an artist. After living there for about a month, Keiichi has gotten used to the life there with his new friends: Rena Ryuugu, Mion Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou, and Rika Furude. While everything appears normal with the village at first, Keiichi learns from a visiting photographer, Tomitake, about some mysterious murders which occur each year. What makes it even stranger is that Rena and Mion, when asked about it, deny the existance of them. Days pass and the anual Cotton Drifting (Watanagashi) festival approaches, and Keiichi finds out from Tomitake and and a friend of his that the murders are supposedly tied to a curse from the village's god, Oyashiro-sama.\n\nFollowing the festival, Keiichi is visited by a police detective, Ooishi, who alerts to him about the death of Tomitake, and the disappearance of his friend. Keiichi is told that this is a result of the curse, and is warned by Ooishi that he could be next. Although skeptical at first, Keiichi begins to become paranoid about his surroundings, and begins to become suspicious of Rena and Mion, who begin acting strangely.\nWhat will happen to Keiichi? Are Rena and Mion up to something? Is the curse real? Will I stop asking all these questions? Find out the answer to all of them (except the last one) in this chapter!\n\nART AND SOUND:It is worth mentioning that all the character sprites that appear in the game have been redesigned by MangaGamer, however you can switch between the original and new sprites if you wish. The sprites from the Playstation versions can be used through use of mods, although I personally don't see anything wrong with botht he old and new sprites. All of the backgrounds and music remain the same as the original, and that I find is good, as it helps preserve the feel that the sound novel is supposed to give.\n\nOne part I am disappointed with is that there are no CG images used, unlike most visual novels. Some parts of the game would be better with CG images in my opinion, and it confuses me as to why MangaGamer didn't include any, considering they went through the effort to redesign the character models. If you wish to view CG images, I believe there is a patch that adds in the ones from the Playstation versions, although the game is still good without them.\n\nOTHER NOTES:The story takes roughly 10 hours or so to finish, which is short compared to many visual novels. This is due to that this is only chapter 1 of the game. For the complete story, there are 8 chapters, 4 question arcs and 4 answer arcs. At the time of writing this review, only the first two chapters are released (Onikakushi and Watanagashi), with chapter 3 currently being translated. More games are on their way, although they don't affect the main story.\n\nRATING: Buy and Play. 9.5/10","January 3","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Behind the deceitfully happy setting and atmosphere at the beginning of the story, lies an unsettling, disturbing and very intriguing story. Since not all chapters are out on Steam yet, i recommend watching both main seasons of the Higurashi anime to get the full understanding of what's going on, and just to overall enjoy a very well crafted story!\n\nI don't think the visual novel is as good as the anime however, and that's mostly because of the rather shoddy translation. It's perfectly understandable, but its obvious that a lot of things were literally translated, so the structure of certain sentences isn't too good. Keiichi, the protagonist, also tends to ramble on and on in a lot of cases, and his questions about what's happening around him quickly become redundant, and i'd wish the game would move on sooner than it normally does with certain things.\n\nNevertheless, this is a good starting point for Higurashi newbies, just to get a little taste of what's Higurashi about, and maybe it'll encourage you to go and watch more of the story via different sources.

I'm an anime person rather than a manga person, because I like listening to Japanese voices and watching the gainaxing, among other things.  I expected a visual novel to be a step down from anime, but maybe a step above manga.  I could not be more wrong; playing Higurashi as a visual novel felt much better than watching the anime!  I don't mind that the anime is kinda low budget compared to other popular animes, and I enjoyed it very much.  However, I enjoyed the visual novel much more.  I got more attached to the characters in the visual novel, which made it much more engaging and feelsy.  Also, it is a very different experience playing as Keiichi, rather than watching everyone in the third person.  Reading his every thought is an important part of Higurashi that wasn't as strong in the anime.  My feelings regarding Ooishi were totally different in the visual novel.\nHaving sprites instead of animation does not detract from a story at all.  For Higurashi, it made the characters get under my skin even more.  Anyone who is an anime or manga enthusiast should definitely try this game.  Anyone who likes Amnesia and thinks they might enjoy visual novels shoud also try this game.","July 5, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the anime was an amazing adaptation of an intricate story, the source material still stands head and shoulders above.  All of the characters are more fleshed out, and given more attention.  There are jokes and club activity scenes that didn't make it into the anime at all.  The story and backstory of Hinamizawa is given way more detail.\n\nIf you've seen the show, or have read the VNs before, on reread, you'll notice so many hints and minor details that clue in at what's actually going on, and it's really satisfying.\n\nIf you're completely new to the series, you'll probably be confused about what's actually going on by the end of the game, but let me assure you that Higurashi is one of the few works I've seen where absolutely every loose-end is tied up by the end of the adventure.\n\nThe translation is really good, way better than the original localization MG put out years ago, and I'm glad they redid it.  The new sprites are also really pretty, and I actually prefer them to the PS3 versions.  The photo-filtered backgrounds don't bug me, but from what I understand, it's easy enough to patch in the PS3 backgrounds with a little googling.\n\nWhen I first saw that MangaGamer was going to charge $5-10 per part, I was a little skeptical, but since picking up and playing parts 1 and 2, I'm eager to throw my money at them for the rest.","December 25, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The jarring tone shifts from light-hearted goofiness to cold horror are handled excellently in this translation. There are some curious choices in using far too many exclamation marks or ellipses during serious moments though, which can detract from the more horror-focused scenes. The writing is colorful, willing to break usual grammatical rules to carry the mood. While it detracted for me personally, I can't stay mad at the translation for taking exceptions to usual rules for the sake of upholding a playful, often melodramatic atmosphere. Nothing is more subjective than writing in horror, especially with a series as unorthodox as Higurashi.\n\nThere were however, a few typos and a rather unnecessary 'lol' used in conversation which did take me right out of the experience. It was brief, but it's definitely a mood-cutter. Fortunately, these typos are getting patched up pretty quickly so by the time you are reading this there is a good chance that this criticism is null by this point.\n\nBuy this visual novel if you have even the slightest interest in psychological and occult horror. You get two forms of sprites to choose from (updated and the original), and steam trading cards if you're into that kind of thing. Achievements as well, which seems silly but hey, at least they went all the way with this game.\n\nI look forward to the next chapter!","May 22, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did hear the PS2 port had CG that I think would help make this version a bit more attractive, but it's certainly outstanding by itself.\n\nIt's a great introduction to the VN medium and to an excellent series, and hopefully with your support, we can get Ch. 2 churned out faster!!!","May 24, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are well-written and really make you sympathize with them. They really elicit some real emotions out of you, especially if you're immersed, which the story's atmosphere itself delivers very well! The way the story builds a bond between you and the characters works really effectively especially when things start to get sinister, as such, it starts out all nice and slow but keeps you intrigued with bits and pieces of creepy foreshadowing events at a good pace, and gets increasingly screwed up the more you get into it! It finishes in a way that really makes you want more and look eagerly forward to the next chapter.\n\nGive it a read and immerse yourself in the mysterious, frightening and thrilling story of Higurashi - When They Cry!","June 24, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And now that it's over... it's... freak-a-ly amazing!  I can't really say anything, without spoiling the story, but it is well worth the price of admission.\n\nThe story is solid blend of daily-life, mystery, suspense, murder, horror, macabre, legends, myths, and ghost tales.  While it takes a spot to get used to how the characters "talk"(since it isn't voiced), the translation is very well done, and helps give the cast their own, unique personalities.  Chapter 1 focuses mostly on the interaction of three members of the cast, and my understanding is later chapters flesh out the rest of the townsfolk of Hinamizawa.  Music and sound effects are blended into the show to help with the immersion of the story.  I enjoyed the updated graphics more than the original character sprites; however, both do have their own charm.\n\nOverall, well worth checking out. ))","November 29, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after the first half is finished, it turns into a fast-paced thrill ride that gives you what you came here for.\n\nThe only thing I did not really like about the game is the user interface for the dialogues. It isn’t like other visual novels where the dialogue is separated by the person who is speaking. It just fills the screen with text until there is no more room left. This makes it hard for to tell who is speaking at times. I know there are some user-created patches that adds voices, but I didn’t know about it until after I finished the story.\n\nOverall, if you haven’t bought this, why haven’t you? This game is considered a classic for a good reason.\n","May 22","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The usual kind of set up was completely turned over on its head as the tension and horror started slowly creeping in to a more than excellent climax!\n\nI would suggest this for all VN veterans, but also anyone who has a passion for mystery and horror that doesn't hold your hand through the game by giving you a definite answer!\n\nI got around 10-12~ hours counting offline time, so for its current price it is more than worth the price. Go buy it and let the descent into madness begin!","May 14","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original visual novel ran from 2002 to 2006 and has been steadily adapted into different forms and has a few alternate extra chapters depending on your format. The Steam release is a re-translation and includes alternate character art as well as a few other extras. If you love visual novels where it's actually just a novel (not a choose-your-own adventure), Higurashi is an excellent experience. It's a very intense story with a winding resolution to the mysteries within. It's an intense story, and if you haven't seen it (or didn't realize the imagery you saw was from it) I recommend looking into it in some form.\n\nThat said, I'm not a huge visual novel fan. If the game had an audiobook format I would recommend that. The story is good, choose your format as you wish.\n\nAlso, "Do you recommend this game?" isn't an accurate portrayal of the experience. This is a book with images and cues to click through. Or this is a manga that happens to not change the background very often (and reuse them liberally). Or this is a movie that happens to have really statically animated characters and only background music. There is no choice, and you can even disable needing to advance dialogue.","May 19","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It makes me happy that the series is now available to a fresh audience here on steam, and I will no doubt buy every chapter for myself, and chapters for my friends as well. If you ever only play one visual novel in your life, you cannot possibly go wrong with Higurashi.","June 6","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
