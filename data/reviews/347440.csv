This game is like a mix of Portal (puzzle elements) and Stanley Parable (Comedic style with serious elements). The puzzles are not super easy, but not extremely hard. (It will take some time to figure some of the later puzzles out) (It also has some harder “secret” puzzles) Pneuma: Breath of Life does not only have superb puzzles, but it also has a great comedic and later though provoking tone. Jay Britton does a superb job with voice acting the main character. With the gorgeous graphics, great puzzles, comedic, and thought provoking tone, Pneuma: Breath of Life is a hidden gem that everyone should at lead play though once. The only thing that I could find bad about this game is the fact of how short it is. I really hope the developers decide to make another game that expands on Pneuma: Breath of Life or add more content/ bonus levels to the current game.\nPros\nGreat Puzzles\nComedic\nThought provoking ending\nStunning graphics\nGreat controller support (as well as keyboard/mouse)\nVR support\nNeat “secret puzzles”\nAwesome voice acting done by Jay Britton\n\n\n\n\nCons\nA bit too short\nNo borderless windowed mode\nVery linear\nAbrupt ending\n\n\nConclusion\nPneuma: Breath of Life is an amazing hidden gem. It’s not only a puzzle game, but a comedic and though provoking story of self-discovery. The only thing that could be said bad about Pneuma: Breath of Life is that is short and linear. I wouldn’t say this game is for everyone, but if you ever see Pneuma on sale you shouldn’t give it a second thought.

Screenshots make it look like a Myst-like experience, but it's much more similar to the recently released Talos Principle. Levels are vibrant in color, though mostly narrow and linear.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are often clever, based around perspective.  A few stand out, however, for being obtuse and poorly communicated to the player.  Ultimately, however, the puzzles never really rose above being decent; I had no massive feeling of accomplishment, owing to their generally small scope and the limited number of interactions needed to solve them.\n\nWhat I most disliked was the story.  The voiced narrator that frequently plays throughout the game annoyed me greatly. His jejune ramblings and initially arrogant tone clashed with the otherwise serene setting of the game.  He goes down a rabbit hole of metaphysics, sounding more like an idiot every time.  As the story progressed, it became so extremely self-referential that I couldn't help but roll my eyes.\n\nFinally, the game is quite short.  Nearly half of my 4 hours playtime was spent idling, and I only really got stuck on one puzzle.  I'd imagine that most gamers could beat the game in under three hours. I feel the game is priced appropriately for that length of time. Having a limited time in the world, whose narrow levels never let me explore it, and with a protagonist that I hated, made me not want to return.  Pneuma is not a bad game, but after completing it, my reaction is more of a shrug.","March 1, 2015","false","4.6"," 52 of 69 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","52","69","0","0"

All interconnected in such natural way as it really is. The thing is if you expect a puzzle game - you'd be dissappointed, it is very short and very primitive.\nA bit more existential than Stanley Parable and phylosophical in a vein of Talos Principle. Linear and some light puzzles in the mix. Pricepoint is a bit high, but it's an experience you won't regret. Just remeber that it's not really a puzzle game.

It is frankly gorgeous, for what that's worth, but it turns out that working puzzles by pointing the camera just leads to frustrating puzzles, and spending a lot of time staring at your nonexistent shoes to avoid setting things off. The puzzles aren't bad enough for me to warn people against the game—but they aren't good enough for me to recommend it either, and that's coming from someone who loves this type of game. If you're looking for a first-person puzzle game, you could do worse, but you could do a lot better too.\n\nAs for the Oculus Rift support: it's terrible. The frame rate is NOT vr-friendly even on a GTX 970. Several effects (including the near-omnipresent water) don't behave sensibly in RIft mode, which is disappointing and distracting. And on a much more fundamental level, puzzles that require you to crane your field of vision up and down are just uncomfortable on your neck. I can see how the "your gaze is a form of input" idea might sound like a good fit for virtual reality, but in this case it's just not—if you're tempted to get this as something to do with your Rift, it's really not worth it.","March 12, 2015","false","1.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The concept for the puzzles is quite new and interesting, and some puzzles might take you time before solving them. The ending is interesting, with Pneuma struggling the whole game to understand his nature, believing he is a God and that the whole world is his...oh how wrong he was, though in the end he fully understands himself.\nDespite enjoying this game a lot, i felt the concept compensates for the length of the game. For 20 euros i would have liked to see more content put into the game (free future dlc would be nice).\nA little bit of resolution issues, but otherwise, this game is a fun experience, coming close to The Talos Principle, but giving it a much funnier air (however the ideas are totally differrent: Talos Principle is about you choosing between following God or going against his word, while Pneuma is about...i'll let you find out on your own :D - great philosophy in both of the games however).","February 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","30","45","0","2"

It's a fifty fifty split.\n\nThe game is beautiful, there's no doubt about that, with all the great structural designs and the shiny colors painted on it, it's a fitting look for what the game is and the story it's telling, but unfortunately it doesn't bother paying attention to little details in its design for a player to make sense of it, and so because of the lack of detailed quality in its design, you are reminded that you're playing a game rather than being immersed in it, in the experience it's trying to give you.\n\nThe story, being god / figuring out what's in the mind of god, is interesting, accompanied with the narration of the person you play as being witty and funny, but it was presented kind of awkwardly and abruptly in the begging, but the ending was amazing and it left an impression on me, but sadly that was the only part that threw me away. It's worth noting though, that the whole game from begging to end, in a sense, is forth wall-breaking, which is kind of nice.\n\nThe puzzles are simple and fun, with most of the puzzles rely on your perspective/vision on certain parts of them, and some of them in some way puts you in a nice little ride. They're beautiful when solving it, and when solved. With puzzles, it's different from person to person, but for me, all of them were easy to figure out and solve. To put in up for comparison, it was a lot less difficult that Portal (1 or 2), and less so than The Talos Principle. I'm not seeing it's bad that it's easy, I'm just saying they are, I don't mind it, because I had fun solving them.\n\nPneuma: Breath of Life is not a bad game, it's a great fun game with good looks and great narration, but it, this will sound cheesy, failed to capture my love for it, with there being little to no charm to it, feeling empty with not much sense of life, and not much fine tuning in quality control to help immersion in its world. I can see how great this game is, but it lacked better execution in all departments, with all of these departments being decent but creative.\n\nFor the 'nice' but not 'great' experience I had with the game, with my two hour completion of it, I'd recommend it at half price. I'm kind of sad that the my experience with it wasn't amazing, as I could see how amazing it could have been, but I'm hoping the next game, with the same topic of being god and the structure of it, has more of an impact with better execution and more charm.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","February 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","25","37","0","1"

I love puzzle games, and though these were a bit simple, they were enjoyable.\n\nThe Oculus Rift support is well done.  I suspect my nausea was in part due to the speed of movement, which would be fine for a monitor but is just a bit much for a RIft.  Might want to add a slider to control that speed.  With some experience, I think that speed would be fine, so I wouldn't want it permanently slowed.","March 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

This game was surprisingly engaging.\n\nPneuma: Breath of Life is a first person puzzle game, but not quite like any other puzzle game I have played.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly simple. Some of them had me scratching my head for a bit, but none were challenging enough to make me say “♥♥♥♥ this, I need a walkthrough”. You do have to think outside the box on occasion, and I opted not to play the optional puzzles for extra achievements (who needs those anyway?). But the mandatory puzzles were all fairly intuitive, once I played around with them a bit.\n\nThe graphics in the game are marvellous. There is nothing flashy or over the top, per se. But everything is so lifelike and the transition from area to area as the world evolves is remarkable. There were many times where I stopped solving puzzles just to admire how the marble looked, or the gold trim on the walls. Simply breathtaking.\n\nThe story is captivating as well. You play as an entity that believes himself a god. Yet the entity is clearly a lonely god, for all it does is ramble to itself as it solves puzzles. But by the end, things will take an interesting turn and you will find yourself lost in thought even further.\n\nAll that being said, this game is an excellent showcase for the new Unreal 4 engine. However, the game took me less than an hour to complete. While it is gorgeous to look at, and massively fun to play, I cannot justify the $20 price tag unless you are willing to spend a fortune on nice graphics.\n\nOr you have the Oculus thing.

Bought it in a sale though and that price was a perfect fit for what I got out of it.\n\nThe game itself looks great, high quality textures and ok lighting. The objects in it do become a little repetive after some point tough. Soundseffects were quite good and the music was not distracting and kept the game alive enough. Only thing missing for me that the world you travel in seems a little to static, it would have been nicer with some wind effect's on the voilage and cloth drapings.\n\nThe puzzels themself were not to hard and had good deal of logic behind them which made the game challanging but soveable without too much gues work.\n\nAls nice narrator with a great story to tell that gives a nice view point.\n","February 7","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/recommended/347440/","tinyturtle","Tiny Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/","870 products in account","Pneuma: Breath of Life is a wonderful puzzle game. The puzzles are all clever and creative, and they're all set within a pretty world that's a joy to explore. I really don't know what else I can truly say about it. It looks good, it plays well, the puzzles are rewarding and clever -- and what more do you want out of a puzzle game? I feel like I can recommend it to anyone that loves a good puzzler. It's not quite perfect though, but even the downside isn't much to write about.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the narrator, the protagonist, who talks endlessly. The things he says rarely interesting and they do little more than make you dislike him more and more, little by little. There's an arch to it, surely, but the moment I just put the voice volume down to 0 and turned off the subtitles, suddenly I was exploring a truly wonderful world, without this stream-of-consciousness semi-philosophical blabbering. The game just got better. The other thing is a pretty blatant mistake, which raises pretty big alarms.\n\nIn the very tutorial, at the very start of the game, you're asked to interact with a lever. Click and hold, then use W/D to move it --- wait, what? D does nothing. A does nothing. W does nothing. No, it's supposed to be W/S. Backwards and forwards. Easy to figure out, but how does something like this make it through playtesting? Seriously! Anyone testing the game should've found this from the start and it should've been fixed instantly. So really my first impression with the game was "oh dear, did anybody actually test this before release?".\n\nThankfully it was the only real problem I had. A couple of finicky puzzles, sure, but all doable. The one time I actually managed to just 'break' the game was by locking myself in a room by undoing the puzzle I had solved to open the door. I slipped inside, the door closed behind me, and then the puzzle within the room was solved -- but I had to go back. But I couldn't. The door was closed. Oops. Not a big deal since I could just quit to main menu and resume again, which saved me having to backtrack to the little puzzle hub.\n\nAll in all, I liked it.","March 6, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

After that, you will have to deal with the select few puzzles which have absolutely zero guidance and solve them pretty much through trial and error.

The list price is €20, and it took me hardly 2 hours to finish this, that said I didn't get stuck very often on puzzles. I bought it in the Summer Sale 2015 for €6, and for that price it's not really an issue. I will not refund it, but for the asking price I would expect more polish. I'll list my pros and cons.\n\nPros\n* Looks nice, lighting effects are spiffy, UE4 makes it look pretty\n* Puzzles are fairly varied and not too tricky, perhaps a bit easy, but a nice balance.\n* Information is discreet but well presented so you know your progress and can figure out what to do next.\n* Dialogue is interesting and adds some context, also indirectly hints at how to solve some puzzles which is nice.\n* Easy to run in VR, just run it and start a game and it's in direct mode on the DK2.\n* The ending is interesting, definitely unexpected by me, even if I did suspect something due to reading reviews.\n\nCons\n* Lighting glitches, black panels that might go away, or not.\n* Runs worse than advertised, in VR I got judder with a GTX 970, and there is no real options to lower the graphics quality.\n* The boot menu is not in VR, it's on your monitor, you have to start an actual level before it goes into VR.\n* Reflections are used a lot, the problem in VR is that fake reflections are very easy to see, at least with so few probes as here.\n* Some puzzles include you standing on stuff while it moves, the physics can go bonkers in those cases.\n* As gaze is used a lot it would seem fitting for VR, but in VR I actually want to use my gaze just to look around, not to control stuff. It might seem like a logical control method, but for me it was less than comfortable.\n* Interacting with buttons requires me to look below it, this had me restart the game three times before I figured out how to interact with the first button, as I looked straight at it.\n* At one point there was no ambient sound at all, that was really spooky and took me out of the experience.\n* For being a VR ready title, some things are done with the camera which I doubt many appreciate. It's only at one point in the game, but some might find that jarring.\n* Way too short for the price asked, lasted me just about two hours.\n* This is a 12 GB download, I guess it's all the dialog, but it has to be possible to compress that better...\n\nI would only recommend this game if you get it in a sale, not for the current price.","June 22, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

This game strives to make a thoughtful point and make the player think about the game world they are interacting with, but it fell flat for me in the end and instead of finishing the game with a new thought to grapple with, I just finished the game a little underwhelmed.\n\nI do not want to give spoilers so I can not go into the specifics of why I was left unimpressed with the ending, but in a nut shell I just felt a little cheated. The main protagonist of this game is constantly talking about the signifigance of every moment, every nook and cranny that he could talk about in this game but all of the talk just ends up at a very obvious point with little reason to think more on it. Now I do not judge every game I play based on its theme, but the theme is so central to this game because there is little else.\n\nThe game is short. It took me two hours to complete and if I was a little smarter it probably would have taken less, if I was a little dumber though it could have maybe been three hours. Some of the puzzles in the game are challenging and some are just downright clever (or even cruel!). But the ways you can interact with the world are very limited. You can either stare at things, walk on things, or occasionally twist and press things with the interaction key. To be fair, they switched up how you would use these mechanics quite often. But these mechanics rarely excited me. Cool things would happen as a result of your stares and presses, but l always felt like I was just tinkering with a machine rather than really calculating the solution to a puzzle. So the short amount of time I did spend with the game was done listening to empty philosophey and poking and prodding my way through an environment until something happened.\n\nBut one thing this game does right is presentation. My God, is this game breath taking! It has very few graphics options, but if you are going to buy this game in the first place, it is because you saw the screenshots and want to see how this game runs on your beast gaming rig. For the most part it runs smoothly (especially if you turn off AA) and always looks amazing. I do not remember one bad texture or one scene where I was not impressed by the art direction of this game. Another part of the presentation that was done well was the voice acting. I may not have felt the script had much substance but it was performed with care and energy. Same with the soundtrack, the music was sometimes a tad creepy, sometimes really majestic. The soundtrack was varied and always set a good tone.\n\nSo I really wanted to like this game, but going around corners to see the next area always felt more rewarding than solving the puzzles, and the constent babble was well performed but lacked meaning to me. I would not recommend this game unless you really are looking for a new desktop background and refuse to use google. But I appreciate the care that the developers put into making this game and know that there is enough good stuff here to make me look at the next thing they create.\n\n","November 6, 2015","false","2.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
