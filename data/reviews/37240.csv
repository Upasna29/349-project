But sadly, there was a one slight problem with it. The game crashed whenever I clicked the play button. HOWEVER, THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO FIX THE CRASHING ISSUE!\n\n1. Open C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Diner Dash Hometown Hero\assets\downloads\_default\restaurants on your computer and you will see a bunch of folders that should be called "ballpark", "boardwalk", "disco", "museum" and "zoo".\n\n2. Go into all of those folders one by one and click on the folder inside each of them called "comics" and delete all the .swf files inside the "comics" folder that say "intro" or "outro".\n\n3. If you did everything right, the game should work fine now (but be warned, the cutscenes won't be there anymore). Enjoy!","February 28, 2014","true","4.0"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","6"

Well, I suppose that's a bit harsh, it could probably scrape worthiness by playtime as if you were to sit and play the entire thing through it would take you an hour or two (I hesitate to comment on its worth as I can think of cheaper games with more substance).\nI did, however, find the Endless mode on this game to get ludicrously hard quite quickly, no idea why. Maybe my parents taught me poor coping strategies.\n\nTL:DR - It's a fun little game that you can easily waste several hours on, over time, and it very easy to pick up and drop whenever you feel like it (the plot, for example, will not have a profound effect on your life and dreams).\nYou will also find yourself passively aggressively judging the customers when they get pissy and shake their heads at you, but it's okay, becase you're fabulous.","December 18, 2014","true","3.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/37240/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Note: this review was posted originally on Neoseeker. I reviewed Diner Dash: Hometown Hero after playing it on iWin free with ads.\n\nFlo is going back to her hometown for a journey through her childhood memories with her grandmother, Grandma Florence. But when she discovers that her favorite places are in poor state and nearing the definitive disappearance, she decides to save them by working in their restaurants with her grandma in the kitchen.\n\n\nDiner Dash: Hometown Hero is the fourth game in the Diner Dash series, featuring Flo, owner of different restaurants in Dinertown. She has to save five different places in her hometown: the zoo, the baseball stadium, the museum, the lunapark and her grandmother's restaurant, which has been closed before her birth and can be saved by a jump to the past. That's Diner Dash for you, Flo can do everything in every time.\n\nThe gameplay is still the same: seat customers, take their orders, serve their meals and collect the money. Additionally, they can also ask for a snack or a dessert. Sometimes Flo will have to use the mop for cleaning the mess kids and babies made or bring a high chair for families. She can also phone for asking help (for speaking to the customers waiting when a podium is available, for playing some music, for bringing cocktails or for bringing plates). Each customer has five hearts. The more they are red, the more higher the tip will be. If a customer loses all his hearts, he'll leave the restaurant. And you'll pay cash this with dollars in less in your pocket. Note that the last restaurant is different from others, as you get four hands: yours and your grandma'. So, it means that you can carry four things at once, instead of the usual two.\n\nThe customers are also carrying colored clothes and seating them on seats with the same color brings bonus points. There are still the usual customers met in the previous games: Cellphone Addict, Business Woman, Bookworm, Family (including mothers with babies and Father with Son), Normal Girl, etc., each with specific features. For example, some customers like Business Woman or Bookworm don't like noises, so seating them near Cellphone Addict is a wrong idea. In the contrary, the noise doesn't bother Family, so you can put the Cellphone Addict near them.\n\nThere are also new customers like the Hungry Man who is ordering twice a meal, the Teen Boy/Girl, addicted to cellphone but flirting with each other when seated near each other or the Local Celebrity, who can replenish the nearing people's hearts. Local Celebrity is as impatient as a Cellphone Addict or a Business Woman, it was already hard to keep these two happy but with a third one... Anyway, they're also the ones to leave a big tip, so, you do understand why I'm concerned by not having the time to satisfy them.\n\nWhen beating a level, you'll be giving the choice to redecorate the restaurant or to propose a new plate. Also, you can upgrade your oven/shoes/drinking station if you want. Beware though, because you have to choose between these three. Also, for the upgrades concerning the restaurant, you'll be given a third choice if you reached the expert level.\n\nBecause well, for beating a level, you have to collect money. And the more you can collect, the more you can expect to reach the expert score who is appearing after having beaten the normal score.\n\nEach level is unique. Not in the background but you will always have something new: the drink station for making patienting the clients, the podium for chatting with those waiting in the queue, a bench for seating a group, the mop, the highchair, the snack (each restaurant has his own) and the dessert (see the snack). You can also have some... rocky grounds, for example, in the museum, you have a mammouth. Well, from time to time, it's getting alive, do his noise and just hit the ground with legs, rocking the restaurant and making a lot of dirty ground that you will clean with your mop.\n\nAlso, you can customize Flo by giving her a new look, adapted to the level or the time she's serving in.\n\nIt's hard to describe this gameplay, however, it's easy to point the flaws. I'm also cursing the flower addition, because if it can bring points, it's not easy when you have a lot in your hands, to put a flower on table, I'm still forgetting it and then, well, it's not really helping for getting the already seated customers happy. Also, for making chains, sometimes, it's hard, you can loose a customer because you want to do chains. Note that it's possible to do them and that for some levels, it's necessary for getting the normal/expert score.\n\nDiner Dash doesn't need 3D for having good graphics. It's always colored and it's always getting to the essential. You can distinct easily each client, the customization presents some good choices and well, it's easy to see where the tables are. I didn't have problems with them. My only complaint will be for the HUD, where you have your clock and your progress bar. I feel like having a front of a car on my screen and compared to Flo on the Go and Diner Dash 2, I think that it was completely non-Diner Dash like. I largely prefer the ancient HUD, more of life for me.\n\nThe music in Diner Dash is always respecting the restaurant you're currently trying to save. For example, for the last one, set in Disco Time, you'll get a soundtrack reflecting it, a disco track. Even if you had to hear it for the ten levels consacred to Flo's grandma's restaurant. Also, it's easy to hear the typical sound of a baby dirtying the ground or announcing that a new client arrived. Also, it's practical to hear the menu put on the table, meaning that you have to take an order.\n\nThe game can be difficult sometimes, the previous game, Flo on the Go, surprised me with its difficulty (and it was my first Diner Dash game) and when I played Diner Dash 2, I found it too easy, except when I had to collect 34 000 dollars and that I was barely reaching 30 000. Hometown Hero is not easy and not difficult. But for beating expert score, well, if you like challenge, no doubt that you'll be coming back to play it, because by doing so, you unlock the famous third choise and can relook your restaurant if you think that this choice is better than the two standard ones.\n\nAnyway, if the price seems high for me for a product that's already 6 years old, I think that the fun is still present and it's still amusing to be the best server in town. Oh and about the crash? I never crashed, weird...","October 16, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
