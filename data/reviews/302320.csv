Like Civil War General 1 and 2 if you remember those from the 90's Sierra days.  I was left pretty disappointed.  I'm a sucker for WW2 games.  The tutorial didn't really explain much of the game.\n\nOne of the annoying things of the game is the fog of war.  It exists, but it's not marked.  Most gave used a shadowy area to show you what you can't see.  This game does not.  I think if I was a commander I'd know how far out my units could see.\n\nThe interface is a little lackluster.  I wasn't a fan of the sound effects (menu system, game).  3D terrian isn't there.  There should be hills on these maps which should be displayed by elevation (graphically).\n\nI could go on, but overally disappointed.  The concept is great, wasn't executed well.\n","June 21, 2014","false","0.5"," 90 of 117 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","90","117","0","0"

Japan as a AI player in the pacific campaign had completely overrun china and south east asia within half a year.\n\n-Sea units only very seldom encounter each other and if they do, they hardly damage each other. So in nearly every sea field unescorted enemy troop transports are shipping merrily their cheap units and you only have a chance to sink one if you have a carrier or bomber in that area. So despite I have a gigantic fleet in the Hawai Area the Japanese can constantly land units. Well you don't have to guard your transports either.\n\n-By january 43 tech 5 and 4 japanese units popped up, despite he and I had only tech level 1 and they are almost invincible for tech 1 units.\n\nSo for the pacific campagin you might better play the Hearts of Iron titles which makes a lot of things better.\n\n","April 11, 2015","false","18.0"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

You could even play as the "loose cannon" country Manchukuo  or other Asian nations as well as Australia.  Make sure to play the tutorial and read the manual -- some controls are not intuitive.","September 4, 2014","true","53.8"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","34","49","0","0"

Cant say that is enjoyable. I have tried\nto give the game several chanses but sadly no. GFx is ok but the interface feels clumpsy. The sea battles is boring. And the battles on maps you dont really feel that you have controll to manage more than moving. The tutorial could have been alot better.\n\nGFx: 6 (gfx looks ok but its hard narrow the maps with all small details)\nSFx: 7-10 (music is ok and fits the game)\nGameplay: 3-10\n\nI cant recommend this game.","January 9, 2015","false","1.8"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"
