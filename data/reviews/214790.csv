"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/214790/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","Ed Mcmillen is, arguably, a video game auteur (though, no one would really contest that). If he isn't an auteur yet, he certainly is a recognizable personality and a welcome individual to the world of video games.\n\nThe Basement Collection is a bundle of Mcmillen's flash work prior to his big hits ("Super How the Hell Did I Miscalculate That?" and "The Binding of Why The Hell Can't I Stop Playing?"). So, the big question is, do the games hold up?\n\nWell like any art or artist, it takes time to develop skill and hone one's-oh wait, nevermind these games are gold. Honestly, you would think that at some point Mcmillen and his team screwed up and made an awful game somewhere and had to bury it like a dirty secret.\n\nNone of these games are some crayon drawing that a parent puts on the fridge to make themselves or their children feel better. The games included in this compilation are all fascinating and top notch, and all of them feel very different from one another. These games all share the familar Team Meat aesthetic and challenge. Out of the games here there should definitely be at least one that will warrant a purchase from you. Maybe it will be the somber story of the adventure game Aether? Or maybe the frantic Grey Matter? Maybe Time ♥♥♥♥, the perplexing puzzle platformer with a dark twist? If you can't find one game here to enjoy, there honestly might be nothing that pleases you.","August 5, 2013","true","21.4"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","36","43","6","0"

Amazing gameplays, great music, some original stories, a great art style... A must have if you're into simple and quick indie games, and if you like other Edmund McMillen's games. Definitely worth its price.\n\nThe Basement Collection is a collection of different indie flash games, created mostly by the creators of Super Meat Boy / The Binding of Isaac.\n\nStory / Setting\n\nMost of what the games have to offer is their gameplay and art style, but some of these games have a really unique story. Meat Boy and Spewer barely even have one for example, whereas Coil is really story driven, even if its story is not really clear, and it requieres your own interpretation of the game. Time ♥♥♥♥ and Aether's stories are present and interesting, but really aren't the core of the games. Finaly, if you unlock AVGM, I'd say that its the game that has the most meaning in the list, this game is litteraly a parody of other games and is only worth playing if you understand what the games is making fun of (or if you want the achievements !)\n\nGameplay\n\nTrust me, there's going to be at least one game that you'll enjoy playing in there. Most of the games are hard to beat completely, like, really hard. Even if you reach the "end" of the game, there's going to be advanced levels or achievements that will take a while to beat and obtain.\n\nI guess you already know how Meat Boy works, since it's basically the original version of Super Meat Boy (one of the best and most challenging platformer I know of). Spewer is an amazing platformer as well, but requieres a bit more tactics than Meat Boy. Aether is like... the smallest sandbox game I've played, it's fun to play and really is different from all these really hard games. I didn't play Triachnid much but it's gameplay is quite unique, even if I found it a bit boring after a while. Grey-Matter is like one of these old Starship arcade games, it's hard to describe. It was fun but I'm a noob at it :( Time ♥♥♥♥ was my favorite one to play and has an awesome idea behind it. It requieres a lot of attention and reactivity, especially in the harder levels. I'd say that it's half puzzle, half platformer, it reminded me of Fez in a way. The only problem with it was the saving system, make sure you click "exit" on the right, under the person who speaks to you (no spoiler) so that the game saves your progress, and try to quit the game with the in game option (top left).\n\nPerformance\n\nKnowing it's a flash game... the performance was pretty bad for what the games had to offer, but it was totally playable. I did have to lower my screen resolution to play Spewer and Aether properly, as the games were quite laggy (kinda like the first Binding of Isaac was, for me). The game can't be rendered by my GPU (because it's flash I guess ?!) and uses integrated intel graphics :( Probably won't be an issue if you have a desktop PC with more a more recent CPU.\n\nStyle / Graphics\n\nAs always with Ed, i'm not dissapointed. It's not as full of weird wonderful things as The binding of Isaac, but pretty much each game has it's own look and feel. Triachnid and Aether were especially enjoyable to play simply because of their art style. Time ♥♥♥♥ wasn't especially nice visualy, (I know that the pixelated look was what was desired) but the game clearly isn't about it's graphics. Finally, the music. Wow. Danny Baranowsky is by far my favorite video game soundtrack composer. If after playing Time ♥♥♥♥, Meat Boy and AVGM, you don't have the melodies stuck in your head you must be deaf.","June 27, 2015","true","20.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

He has done almost all of my favourite games.\n\nThis gamepack does including these games :\n\nAether :\nI dont know what to say about this game actually it's kind of a sandbox game but it's not.\nIt has real objectives and it contains lots of content.\nYou're playing as some kind of guy who has a flying spiderman kind thingy who can grap on clouds.\nYou have to travel around planets and help their problems. If you've done anything the planet will be happy and you can go to the next place. As every Edmund game this has some kind of similarity to other McMillen games. It has lots of mistery and it keeps you playing towards to the end.\n\nTime ♥♥♥♥ :\n\nI think this game is a real badass thing. You are as steven who you should know from BOI if you have played it for even like 1 or 2 hours. Its style is very simple its kind of like Limbo but it has its own originality. It has some story line in it but i never did follow that i just played  like when i played BOI for the first time.\nThis game should give you a mind♥♥♥♥ if you play enough.\nI really liked this you should really try this out.\n\nSpewer :\n\nAs it says its a physics based platformer. Uhhh . yeah kind of but it has some funky and ugly stuff at the same time.\nI mean it has puking yourself in the air in it and things like that.\nIt has weird things going on. I really liked this when i played this for the first time but as a flash game its really simple and not very addictive for a longer playtime.\n\nMeat Boy:\n\nMeat Boy is a 2d platformer just like spewer and time ♥♥♥♥ but its really hard compared to time ♥♥♥♥ because this game needs some skill to play it not really just logic .\nI really liked this one as its "complete" game the super meatboy.\nIm sure you will like it if you like hard platformers.\n\nGrey Matter :\n\nOk grey matter is the game that i never liked as much as the others. It is a 2d shooter game like these old-school spaceship shooter games but with a twist. Its kind of hard and i can't say too much about this game because i didnt play with it too much.\n\nCoil :\n\nCoil is the game thats not really a game. It is a story for real. It has some s*x and i didnt really comprehend its true meaning.\nMy thinking is that its about you know.... I dont really wanna tell more about this.\n\nTriachnid :\n\nThis game is a little slow-moving and kind of turn based but its real time but its a little hard to control.\nTriachnid is a spider physics game. You do play as a spider and you have to get from point a to point b.\nIt has a real addictive way to get in love with pyhics based games. I really liked this one i hope you'll too\n\n\n","September 1, 2014","true","0.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

So, should be amazing stuff, amirite? Well, some of its pretty good, and I won't deny that one bit. But it should be disclaimed that everything of value here, you can already play on flash websites like Kongregate and Armor Games. Not only that, but they also perform better there. In fact, problems with these games actually seem to be multiplied when being ran as a program. For me, Spewer is the highlight of this stress. Due to problems with memory leaks, its just accepted by the community that yes, restarting the game IS the best way to push back against its unresponsiveness --- which only helps for a few minutes. This renders Spewer unplayable.\n\nReally, the only reason I can see that this could be considered a worthy purchase is if you want to be able to play the ORIGINAL Meat Boy without having to connect to the internet, which mind you, controls notably worse then Super Meat Boy. If you're really looking to support the "big name behind Isaac and Meat Boy", I'd advise you to maybe consider if you'd prefer purchasing their soundtracks instead, as this will likely just end up being added clutter to your Steam Library.","November 24, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No local saving so if you have to reformat or use a different machine you'll have to copy your save to usb and such, otherwise your achievements that are unlocked will unlock all your old stuff, just no save progress for long games like Meat Boy. Yeah, these are all free around the internet but these are also Newgrounds games, so actually good flash games. Classic Meat Boy is a hard as balls platformer that took me forever to 100% and all of these are completely different games. Great humor though through out all the games, and there are unlockable comics that are by the artists that is amazing, about a boy who hears a dead crow talking to him, it is adult context with a super simple look that a lot of these games posses a portion of. Yes oh yes I recommend this game because I like them to be this hard. Those flash games I would come home and play all night to beat in a sitting, now I own them and I can save there progress. I even gifted this game to a friend so they would have a variety of games to play.","May 22, 2014","true","52.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you liked playing all sorts of games on Newgrounds back in the day, like Ed McMillen's work, and want to see what his old games were like, I guess this might be for you. In all honestly, it was pretty hit and miss with me.\n\nCoil was pretty abstract and didn't really give you instructions on what to do, which was the draw I suppose. Honestly wasn't too engaging.\n\nTriachnid was pretty slow, and the physics can get really bothersome at times. Interesting atmosphere and way of telling it's story.\n\nMeat Boy was pretty fun when it was on Newgrounds, and controlled pretty well at the time. But now after Super Meat Boy came out, it really doesn't hold up. The controls are really primitive and half the difficulty of the game is just fighting the controls. Several of these levels would be nowhere near as difficult if you put them into Super Meat Boy. Not really a fan of this one unfortunately. Super Meat Boy is just much better.\n\nTime ♥♥♥♥ pretty much plays out like those old flash puzzle games. Kind of interesting and neat, and it did get a new set of levels in The Basement Collection. Unfortunately, those play out more like a ROM hack of this game instead of just being more levels fo play through. Those aren't really fun.\n\nSpewer is my favorite from this collection of games. It's a puzzle platformer where your character has basically a barfing jetpack mechanic to help him get to certain places. The levels are pretty fun, and the main gimmick has plenty of ways to work out. Unfortunately, it can get a bit finnicky at times.\n\nAether is kind of a puzzle adventure game that's kind of interesting once you play through it. Unfortunately, finding the space landmarks for the achievements just isn't fun. Kind of interesting, but not much to it.\n\nGrey Matter is a interesting game that I didn't find too engaging. It's a shooter type game, except you have to run into the enemies, and avoid the bullets. It was kind of fun, but I didn't have any real interest in the end.\n\nA.V.G.M. is an unlockable game, that's a satire on cow clicker type games. The joke ran too far, and the joke itself wasn't that great.\n\nOverall, a really mediocre collection. Get it if you're interested in Ed McMillen's old games, but there's really not much reason to get it otherwise.","July 26, 2013","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He's also a genius. He's the man behind the modern classics Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac, titles you should already recognize if you've been a Steam gamer for any amount of time.\n\nThe Basement Collection is a compilation of his old flash games which made him famous on Newgrounds. Granted, it's an excellent compilation, complete with tons of extra levels and DVD extras, but whether it's worth your time or not really just boils down to the question "How eager are you to play these games again?"\n\nI say this, because this collection mainly exists for historical significance alone. The games themselves are low-res, glitchy, have mildly-to-maddeningly infuriating controls, and most of them are simply exercises in masochism. They’re the type of game you beat just to be able to say you beat it, and that it’s finally over with. In other words, a good challenge. But if you want to unlock all the extras that make this package worth the money, you’ve got to play through the games again. So it all comes down to how appealing that sounds to you.\n\nIf these games are important to you and mean something to you, if they were the games that defined your childhood and the games you'd secretly play in computer lab in high school or something, hey, I respect that. Buy it without hesitation and support the man who gave you hours of joy in your youth. We all have our nostalgia bombs and we have every right to indulge.\n\nBut if you've never played these games before, there are much better Edmund McMillen games on the market, as well as better games to play for their historical significance alone; I recommend seeking those out instead.\n\n(Oh, and it’s also quite hard to 100%, so achievement hunters beware!)","September 24, 2014","false","40.3"," 24 of 47 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","24","47","2","0"

I knew about Super Meat Boy, so I wanted to learn more about his style with this collection. So far I've only played Time ♥♥♥♥ so I'll talk about that:\n\nThis game is the best mindf*ck I've experienced in a looong while. It exemplifies the struggle of self and identity, reality, life and death. What I love most about it is the main antagonist, who seems to be you from the future: now trapped in this alternate dimension of maze-like rooms you find yourself in (which feels an awful lot like purgatory). As you go room to room and solve puzzles, this other self constantly puts you down and spouts all sorts of disturbing nonsense, while simulatenously cheering you on and pleading for help. Imagine something like an existentialist GLaDos, only crazier and more negative. If you can imagine that.\n\nThe game itself raises a multitude of philosophical questions and really makes you think deeply beyond the creative puzzles. The puzzles themselves can be maddening; the fact you have a limitless amount of lives and continues only adds to the sense of hopelessness, but you feel so fascinated and driven to keep going and solve each one, just to see what happens next...","June 29, 2013","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

However if you come into this not having previous experience with McMillen's work, then you might find some of the things in this to be a bit strange.

Each game is unique, providing a massively different experience, and most of them are replayable, meaning you don't have to drop it when you get the golden god achievement.\n\nThey're fun, and for €4 ($5?), it's worth trying, no matter what you think of it afterwards.

I enjoy Spewer's, Time ♥♥♥♥'s, Aether's new smoother, crispier selves. Meat Boy was thrown under the bus.\n\nMeat Boy is a very good game with consistent controls. These controls, while a tad floaty, are suited to the game's design. Meat Boy jumps just within the right height and width the character needs to see to the end of the level, turning this struggle into an elegant foray of taps and clicks. Every time you press the space bar, you feel in control of the hang time and brevity of the leap. It's simple and comfortable for a game with vertically designed levels in mind.\n\nSuper Meat Boy's levels are, for the most part, horizontal, and designed for a controller.\n\nSo, whoever decided to throw out the original controls in turn for these new ones is an idiot.\nMeat Boy, as a game where it's levels are designed with the controls in mind, does NOT work with new controls.\n\nSimple.\n\nNow the game plays like an awkward, floppy piece of meat, where instead of dancing across levels, now feels as entertaining as swinging a stick around in a figure 8. Also, the stick is falling apart, constantly. As SOON as you let go of the space button, Meat Boy plummets to the ground as fast as he left. There is no arch like there was in the original, just because more people played Super Meat Boy and that's what they're used to.\n\nAnd hey, on a controller, I'M used to that too! But guess what? No controller support!\n\nAND, you can't change the controls back to the original!\n\nMAN.

I'd say right away it's worth the money, especially since it's cheap. And as for most of this guy's games the music is great.\nMeat Boy is pretty terrible. If you thought Super Meat Boy was a pain, try imagine it with unresponsive controls.\nTriachnid is interesting but barely anything you'll play for long.\nCoil - Play a sperm!\nAether is just kinda adorable and has you flinging through space. Not much to it but it's time well wasted.\nTime ♥♥♥♥ is probably the mechanically most interesting one, very much worth a try.\nSpewer is a great platformer with a nice look to it and good mechanics, but it maniacly pumps up the difficulty very suddenly. This is probably the most interesting of the games alongside Grey Matter... Which I can't really describe well, but it's quite a neat game.\n\nThe Basement Collection ain't much with much in it.

Platforming in flash is bad enough but with a keyboard it's repugnant.\n\nGrey Matter is an uninspired asteroid style shooter, Coil is some experimental wank and Triachnid is a "spider-sim" which involves you having to move each of it's three legs, one at a time by mouse. It's tedious to say the least.\n\nFinally Meat Boy is what it says on the tin; ever wanted to play Super Meat Boy with worse graphics, music, controls and on a keyboard? You're in luck! Nostalgia for the small crowd of people who were teenagers when Newgrounds was still "a thing".\n\nThe Basement Collection is certainly a fascinating insight into the works that came before Super Meat Boy and the Binding of Isaac but from a gameplay perspective it is completely primitive and tiresome.","July 4, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","7"

The music is good and there's some strange McMillen style story going on, if you're interested in this title it's available for free online (Newgrounds).\n\nTime CFUK is a puzzle platformer that deals with alternate dimentions or time travel or something.  It's actually pretty well put-together and I'd say is the highlight of the games in the collection.  I found the strange storyline appealing.  This is available for free online as well.\n\nSpewer is a physics-based platformer where you puke out goo that you use to navigate the levels.  It's alright, your typical flash-based game.   Once again, available for free online.\n\nMeat Boy - the prequel to Super Meat Boy.  Super Meat Boy is great because of its tight controls.  Imagine if Super Meat Boy had laggy controls and no controller support - that's what playing Meat Boy is like.  If you want to see what the flash prototype for Super Meat Boy is like you can find it free online.\n\nGrey Matter is kind of like a shmup but instead of shooting you use your "ship" to smash into things, creating a triangle within which the enemies die.  I'm a big fan of shmups and found this to be lacking.  If you want to check it out, it's free online (seeing a pattern here?)\n\nCoil isn't so much a game as it is art.  It was an alright piece, I found it weird and difficult to figure out.  You might like it, I wasn't a huge fan.  Check it out for free online for the same experience.\n\nBesides the above games, you can unlock the following games:\n\nThe Lonely Hermit (beat Triachnid) - never played this because Triachnid is broken.  You can find it free online.\n\nAVGM - "Abusive Video Game Manipulation (beat Coil) - a real stupid game.  All you do is click a lightswitch to make items appear and disappear.  Pretty huge waste of time.  You can find it free online.\n\nIn addition to those two if you browse to [~steamapps/common/basement/moregames] there are four more games:\n\nCarious Welting - a missile defense clone with McMillin's art style.  Available free online.\n\nCarious Welting 2 - sequel to the above, same idea.  Available free online.\n\nClubby the Seal - sidescrolling action game where you're a seal and kill Eskimos.  Available free online.\n\nDumpling - a momentum-based physics game.  Available free online.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBesides the games you get some bonus artwork and drawings from McMillen's sketchbooks.  There's a bit more bonus content but that's really the extent of it.\n\nWould only recommend if you're a huge, HUGE fan of Edmund McMillen.  Otherwise you can pass and either play the games free online to see what they're about or just skip them entirely - most are pretty forgetable.","July 6, 2014","false","5.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Plays like one of those pre-gameboy handhelds from the 90s. A brick with buttons would be more exciting.\n\nThe controls are unintuitive, the play is boring and repetitive, and half the 'games' aren't even games. I mean there's a freaking "game" where you spam mouse clicks on a light switch. That's it. Nothing else to it. Just clicking a light switch. You're not even timed. It's utterly pointless.\n\nThe ONLY saving grace of this travesty is a retro version of Super Meat Boy, but even that plays like 3 week old beef that's been left out in the sun too long. Simply put, you'd probably have more fun rolling around in your own excrement for a while than playing this crap.","June 29, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","1"

Sure, most were created quicky, but I'm surprised at how badly the controls don't work in most of them. The best game, Time ♥♥♥♥, is VVVVV with level shifting instead of orientation swapping.\n\nIs there some sort of rule that physics based Indie games must have really really terrible controls? Aether is a tedious rope swinging game that attempts to use rope physics to swing from planet to planet.\n\nCoil was the last straw. Basically, according to the dialogue, you play as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥'s sperm as you violate a woman, impregnate her, and then drive the newborn? into despair during the formation of the fetus (how does that even work?).

So I guess I'll just go by each game:\n-Meat Boy\nIt's alright, it's just like super meat boy except with worse controls. Just go play super meat boy.\n-Triachnid\nThis ♥♥♥♥en game is really ♥♥♥♥en annoying you gotta drag the 3 legged spiders legs and make it move and there is absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing way. It's not fun at all. You just die for no reason and there are stupid maggot things you gotta collect and 1 is impossible. The music in this is pretty ♥♥♥♥.\n-Aether\nProbably the best one, you just float around in space and visit different planets and solve puzzles. It's actually kinda fun even if it is really short.\n-Time ♥♥♥♥\nWTF. This is a puzzle game where you shift between planes or something like plenty of other puzzle games out there. It gets really difficult at the end and there are ♥♥♥♥ puzzles made by the community and some are actually impossible. Also the music is really annoying.\n-Spewer\nA game where you spew ♥♥♥♥ out do puzzles way too ♥♥♥♥ing hard. WTF were they thinking. It's no fun if you have to do the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t level 1 million times coz the game keeps lagging, in a bloody flash game. This game was really ♥♥♥♥ing laggy, I think maybe it was the spikes or the goo or something but it was no good. Too ♥♥♥♥ing hard.\n-Grey Matter\nYou fly around and destroy ships like geometry wars or something. Pretty boring.\n\nThen there is one where you just click a light switch and make stuff appear on the screen. you're supposed to click it like 100,000 times or something. Couldn't imagin why i would wanna do that.\n\nIn the end a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ games doesn't make a good one. I dunno why I would wanna look at pictures of Edward McMillen when he was a kid.\n\n2/12\n\nOH and there's a game called coil.

Why? Because of many, many reasons.\nFirst of all, it is a collection of games, from the creator of Super Meat Boy. All of them are flash games (like the ones you play via Internet, such as the ones from Facebook), which is something strange coming from a Steam game.\nSecondly, the games included are all quite morbid, spooky and some of them disgusting flash games. Between them are games in which you are a sperm, others in which you are some strange type of monster who can vomit indefinitely, and much more. Also, there is the original Super Meat Boy, which was a flash game.\nFinally, these are not complex games, these are just to pass the time when you don't know what to do.\nTo sum up, some good flash games which can make you have a good time when bored. But don't expect much more from the game.\n\n5.5/10\n\nReally good collection of games to pass the time, but won't keep you entertained for so much.\nBut, for only $4, I think it is a good choice, and even more if you like the imaginative Edward McMillen games.","February 16, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I can pay a cheap price to get alot of his most popular flash games on a download. Not only does it not store in a flash file or whatever but alot of the popular games are all in one package. It's great! Plus you can try earning achivements from steam. If that's your thing. Either way, I think it's a great idea "The Basement Collection". I'd also reccomend buying it to support Edmund Mcmillen and the other Devs that helped make the game. I didn't mind paying the price. This/These games are really without a doubt enjoyable. To the proto type Meat Boy to Time ♥♥♥♥, It's just great! A Bunch of good flash games in a single package. Not sure what else to say.

You play as this little  guy who has been forced to go through a series of platform challenges by his future self.  Along the way, you get text messages from yourself in the next room, sometimes helpful, sometimes not.  Overall +1\nSpewer - Fun, but to floaty.  You play as this little genetically engineered thing that propels himself using his spew.  It sounds really fun, but when you actually play it, it's way to floaty.  Overall +0\nMeat Boy - Basically just a crappier, laggier version of Super Meat Boy.  Just play Super Meat Boy for pete's sake! Overall -1\nTriacnid - Fun, and as addicting as hell.  You play as a Spider, and you have to move all three of your legs independently of each other, trying to complete the stage with your egg sack intact.  It's really fun, but those 2006 physics and hit detections are subb-par.  Overall +1\nCoil - I don't know what to do.  I get that's the point of the game, but I get tuck on the second stae.  Overall +0\nAether - Fun, but not great.  You play as a boy, riding a monster.  The monster can grab planets and clouds with his tounge, swinging himself and the boy to greater hieghts.  Ummm... that's about it.  Oh, and it can be laggy sometimes, but you can easily turn offf the stars, which helps a lot.  Overall +1\nGray Matter - Fun, but too fast-paced.  Basically, you're a dot, trying to run into other dots, while avoiding flashing dots.It really just moves too fast for me.  Overall, +0\n\nPlus you got all the extra content, revamped ♥♥♥♥, soundtracks, and more unlockable gameplay.  It's a fun collection of games, and for 2 bucks on Steam, I say take it for what it is, and buy it.","January 1, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Many of these games are ones I played during the early days of Newgrounds. It's quite nostalgic. They're still entertaining, of course, but...\n\nI think the main selling point for this game is all the extras. All the inside looks. The more I read, listen, and watch, the more I understand Edmund's way of creating games. In turn, I like to think it'll help me become better as well.\n\nIf you're at all interested in game development or Edmund McMillen (his life, games, etc), I would pick this up. For such a low price, it's a fantastic deal.","April 19","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
