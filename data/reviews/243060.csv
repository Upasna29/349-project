I do. You wanna know something people don't often remember? Urban Chaos. And i don't see why. It's a sort of spiritual predescessor to it, in an odd way.\n\nIt looks alright for 1999 i suppose. Horrid by today's standards, but for the time, it looks decent. The draw distance is alright overall, my only major problem with it graphically is that it's always night. There's ONE mission that takes place during the day; otherwise, it's nighttime. It's my only complaint i can give for the game graphically that isn't caused by the time it was released.\n\nControls are a bit odd to get used to at first, but they work. Your character has Quasi-Tank Controls. While you CAN turn while moving, it's extremely finicky, and most of the time you're better stopping, turning and then moving. The fighting controls are okay, you've got your basic punching and kicking, and the "special moves" (grapples and the like) are simply performed by hitting a particular direction while punching or kicking. It auto locks on to enemies for you, and shooting is as simple as hitting the punch button with a gun out locked on to an enemy. My only problem with the controls comes with vehicles; they control terribly. There's very little real grasp of physics with them, and while they don't nessescarily use the tank controls, sometimes when you stop the game will behave like you DO, and your car will be locked in place for no reason for a couple of seconds before being able to move again. Considering how fast your sprint is however, generally you shouldn't need a car.\n\nThe levels are fairly expansive, and lend each mission a sort of Open-World vibe. There's secrets hidden around, optional objectives, stat boosts, weapon caches and all sorts of other stuff just begging for you to go off the beaten path to find. It can be a bit distracting from your main goal at times, but overall i feel like it helps the game quite a lot, it makes it go from what would've been a barebones linear Third Person Shooter with a decent melee combat system, to a rather open, fun to explore Quasi-Sandbox game.\n\nDespite the minor flaws, i really can't see why this game isn't remembered better. If it's on sale pick it up; these day's a bloody Potato could probably run it with no issue, and it's fairly enjoyable.\n\nEDIT: Of note though, apparently the game is extremely finicky on 64bit systems. Some it'll work on, some it doesn't. If you have a 64bit system, buy it at your own risk.","November 15, 2015","true","2.3"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","5"

I spent countless hours playing and replaying this game, and it was the greatest!\n\nI remember coming home from school many times and asking to play this game, I was legitimately excited to play this. So when I discovered earlier today that this game is on sale for £1.24, how could I refuse?!\n\nIn the many hours playing this game as a child I eventually found some pretty game breaking bugs like being immune to fire with a pistol equipped. Or when you back to a wall, tap forward, back to the wall again without moving forward or back, tap forward again and suddenly you're at the top of the building. Can legit finish the jumper mission in about less than 30 seconds using that glitch. And can't figure out how to get to that enemy on the top of the building? Have no fear! The backing-into-a-wall-to-get-to-the-top-of-the-building bug is here!\n\nBugs aside, the game still runs like a dream, for its time the combat is really smooth, movement handles well on both foot and vehicle (once you adjust to the unorthidox control scheme). The max resolution however is only 1024 x 768~, which is fine for a 16 year old game, it meant that when I tried to stream it I just had to capture the game via monitor recording, rather than window/game capture, but it was no biggy. The voice acting is superb for its time too, there are a lot of old games with awful voice acting *cough* Resident Evil *cough* that make you cringe at every scene with dialogue, but not with this game.\n\nSo to conclude:\n\nUrban Chaos, a hidden gem that time forgot, sadly ahead of its time, I have still yet to meet a person who has actually heard, let alone played this game (it was released a full 2 years before the likes of GTA 3). Dated graphics and sound but great voice acting.\n\nSo that aside I give this game a solid 8/10, would definitely recommend - especially with it being £1.24 for the next couple days.","February 10","true","4.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","3"

It's levels are large and to a degree, partially non-liniar which makes them fun to explore as you do the various missions in each level, and the sound design is decent. The graphics are extremely dated, but by no means are they ugly. AND the game stars an interesting woman of colour as it's protagonist so yay for inclusiveness!\n\nThe biggest issues are going to be it's lack of native support for higher resolutions & wide screen, and it's clunky and tricky to get used to controls. You CAN fix the resolution issues if you google search it, but you need to download an alternate executable for the game, so make sure you're happy to do that or live with the default limitations. The controls on the other hand have no easy fix. The keyboard is ill suited to it, and the 360 controller seems to have troubles mapping correctly and registering it's analogue sticks. I have found reasonable success with my PS2 controller, but your milage may vary. Suffice it to say, as awkward as the controls are, they are not inpenetrable, and if you can find your groove with them, the game plays very smoothly.\n\nIf you're looking for "the origional open world game", this is not what you're looking for. You select a map, pick a mission, and go do that mission. If I had to liken it to something, it would be Super Mario 64 with it's painting worlds. But if you're willing to learn to grapple with a clunky control scheme, then there's actually a lot to like about this one!","June 22, 2014","true","1.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

After around ten minutes the game becomes extremely laggy for no apparent reason, and even the main menu seems unresponsive at times. It also doesn't handle the 360 controller very well, but I hardly expected it to. My generic joypad works fine with the game, however.\n\nI honestly can't recommend this version, but if you're lucky enough to run it without any issues or you can find an old PS1 copy of the game, give it a chance. It's an immensely underappreciated game. Open world (to a limited degree) driving, fighting, shooting, platforming and the like -- how can you go wrong? And this was long before the overused "GTA clone" label was applied to almost every similar style of game beyond the release Grand Theft Auto III.","March 10","false","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

The first of which is a game breaker which is why I can't presently recommend the game. I'm not the only one to have experienced this. It doesn't take long to crash each time I play it. I found a widescreen mod online which works really well and displays the game at my native resolution. However, due to the game's instability I'm a bit annoyed that it's listed as compatible with Windows 7.\n\nSecondly, this isn't really a big problem. In fact, I'm lucky it works at all for such an old game, which is controller support. The Xbox 360 controller only has a limited amount of its buttons compatible with old games. Most of the buttons work fine when I map them, but unless I run, I stay still or I start doing a moonwalk. I can control it with the keyboard, but a controller is so much better so I'd like to fix this. I can't even complete the first physical training course because it's too difficult to run straight and keep my balance.\n\nSo, the first one is what  absolutely needs fixing. The second would be nice. If somebody has a solution and I can play it properly, I will alter my review because it is a good game. It's a shame that my reunion is delayed.","May 3, 2014","false","0.4"," 27 of 52 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","27","52","3","0"

Maybe it played better on consoles back when it first came out, but unless you have some deep nostalgia for it, I suggest you give it a pass. Any enjoyment I might have derived from this game was lost in the numerous design and control issues.\n\nI've never been a fan of tank controls, but in conjunction with an unruly camera with no mouse support and combat that demands immediate reaction it becomes extremely frustrating. The melee system allows you to perform combos, but you never will, because it's faster to just grapple the enemy and cuff him while he's on the ground. Guns have to be locked onto an enemy to hit, and trying to get locked onto the right enemy in the heat of battle while having to keep constantly on the move to evade enemies' bullets is no easy task. There are just too many annoyances in the combat to delve into all of them; getting caught in 'melee mode' so it becomes impossible to flee, enemies constantly sliding to knock you down the instant they get close, the list goes on.\n\nOn top of the combat issues, some of the game's mechanics only serve to compound the problem. There's no map, so it becomes an ordeal to navigate to several of your objectives, especially when the only way there is via a convoluted route across the rooftops that starts nowhere near the objective itself. There are no checkpoints and no way to save mid-mission, but many missions are way too long for such a handicap, especially considering that you'll also have to redo any side events or collectibles you got if you die. The story is pretty bare bones and towards the end takes on a supernatural element that goes completely unexplained.\n\nUnless you've got a history with this game it's really not worth your time or money, even if it's dirt cheap.","December 5, 2014","false","8.6"," 7 of 30 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","7","30","2","1"

The controls were very difficult to get used since you have to deal with the tank controls, but playing this game with the keyboard is a lot worse, and the default control scheme doesn't even help at all, plus driving in this game is a big pain too.\n\nOverall, this game is not too bad. There were some fun aspects of the game, like arresting or killing thugs or whatnot, but if you do not like playing games with complicated controls, then this is not for you.","March 16","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
