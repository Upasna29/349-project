Awesome!\n\nAll is good, good except the lack of effort put into it.\nI almost feel like they were doing something good but quit half-way because deadlines or something, they didn't even do much follow up after release besides patching game-breaking bugs that didn't allow people to play at all. If I'm recalling correctly the beta correctly, they were trying to put the teleporter utility back in, but ended up not for who knows what reason (although I never got to play it at that time personally due to game launching bugs, so I watched someone else also in the beta who could).\n\nSecondly, the lack of Wompot in unraked matches despite still being workable with no bugs (tested with cheat engine), and not being able to choose your team color online is rather disapointing. What's your beef T17? You are doing no one any favours by gradually removing features every game, you actually discontented customers. I can garentee my play time would be almost double it is now if wormpot wasn't removed from unranked matches where you play with friends.\nSpeaking of lack of effort, want to know something about one of the DLC maps? It litterally looks like it was generated with the in-game map editor, but they added in a few insignificant objects to it to make it qualify as a DLC. Gross.\n\nWhat's with Team 17 and bombing their remasters? First this, now Worms World Party.\n\nI can't really recommend or not recommend this game over the older games. This is a 2 in 1 game with enhanced looks (and voice acting for W4M story), and has a huge imporvement on physics and camera movement over the original W3D (though, it is practically the same with W4M), but due to the removal of some core features it really gets brought down (I can't even play a modded game without a modded .exe now).","September 11, 2015","true","172.8"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/70600/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","For the record my favorite Worms game of all time is Worms Armageddon. The art style, the game play, weapons, level editor, and game layout (options, theme, layout of menus) were all done right. This is when games were made to be bought once, and to be bought as a whole.\n\nI saw Worms Ultimate Mayhem as a recommended game instead of Armageddon. The first thing that caught my eye was that this game was the 3D version of what I loved so much. I figured for the on sale price, I'll give it a shot. I can tell you that I am not at all disappointed with my purchase (except that Worms is still a turn based game! I wish they would make a real time one - how? Well I'm not getting paid to make or suggest games). Seeing worms in 3D is phenomenal, and the art and them style they chose to go along with the game just fits it perfectly. The game play is just as good as ever, however will take some time to adjust and get used to the new range/power system. I didn't know a worm could throw a grenade three football fields away from the map. Lesson learned.\n\nGame play itself can be seen from first person or third person worm view. Weapons are varied as usual and are cool to use and shoot. The explosive or corrosive materials found around the map can also be used to eliminate your opponent. Does the 3D land disappear after you blow it up? Damn right it does. How are the camera angles? Actually quite consistent when using weapons, can be a bit confusing or frustrating when simply observing the map. I find that even with unchecking the inverse box for camera angles sometimes it turns itself back on. This is usually fixed by simply squaring the screen with the worm again. That's essentially the only complaint I have is the camera controls.\n\nThis game does have CONTROLLER SUPPORT - which is greatly appreciated.\n\nThis deserves an 8.1/10 as worms in 3D with the game play and art style they chose, I'd have to give it a .1 over than my solid 8 average. It is a fun game - and can keep you busy for a while with the story, challenges, or just a quick match.\n\nFor future Mayhem games (or 3D worm games), maybe try getting rid of the turn based system, or play around with allowing more first person type of play. Do something XCOM : enemy unknown would do (wait, take cover and fire at the enemy when in range) with worms the player isn't using. Also, please try to improve the camera controls!\n\n(I did get this game on sale :)\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.5/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	B	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\nThe worm customizations properties are original and awesome. I call him, the FroStache\n\nSomeone is about to get punched into the water\n\nThe Fatkins airstrike is deadly (part 1)\n\nThe aftermath of the Fatkins airstrike\n\nDynamite is still my favorite explosive\n\nTwo catapults firing at him and he's happy\n\nHow can he see me through that helmet and from so far away","November 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","0"

Is this game is a childhood ruined or exchanced? I'm on the fence.\n\nThis game is more or less an expanded version of old Worms 4: Mayhem. Most notable changes are graphical upgrades and Worms 3D singleplayer campain available to beat. Those are fine additions and the core gameplay is still okay, but there are noticable problems.\n\nOverall art still is a cartoony but normal-looking 3D graphics clash with poor cel-shaded explosion effects - this combination just don't work. Old Worms 3D effects where more eye inviting. Music is completely horrible. Worms 3D (game) and Armagedonn had a distinctive styles: happy-party and grim-doomy respectively. This game is just bland with uninspiring music and no art direction.\n\nGame is slower paced than a 2D worms, which is not a bad thing on it's own. However, overall experience isn't what fun, thanks to the sluggish weapon and utilities physics. Weapons behave very strangely. Some are extremely reliable (constant 50DMG Bazooka shots) or suprisingly unreliable (Banana Bomb). On top of that, AI is still stupid as a Sheep. Team 17 never programmed a fine artificial enemies.\n\nWorms 4 singleplayer missions are uninspired. they are paired with pretty bland story around them. The included Worms 3D missions are more interesting. They are compact, focused and not bounded in half-baked story arcs.\n\nMenus ergonomy and UI needs a complete rework. Hidden important options, difficult navigation, poor visuals.\n\nThis game is somethat a fun experience, but you need other people with the same preference to the 3D Worms games as you. With friends, you will have a blast, thanks to the better controls and hilarity of events. You don't have such people around you? Make a pass. You had enough of Worms in 3D (no matter, if in the good or bad way)? Make a pass. I'm still giving this game a Upvote, but it is a close one. I feel really generous today or maybe I feel nostalgic to those original Worms 3D missions?","February 20, 2014","true","14.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

We're talking about a Worms game that belongs in Team17 Studios' 3D series, which I personally love! (Oh boy! I can't forget how many hours I've spent with Worms 4: Mayhem). The game's mechanics are pretty simple, meaning that you can Move/Scope/Shoot easily. The use of a Joypad is highly reccomended since it makes it a lot easier for you to play this specific game. Well, the game's Single Player storyline is smooth and very funny, but what is more exciting and fun to play is its Multiplayer! Moreover you have the option to customize and to create your own Weapons and of course the Worm's Outfits and Style, which I find really good and interesting if I may say. Furthermore the game's goal is simple and that is what makes it "easy" as I mentioned before. Obliterate the enemy team!.To sum up its a valid game to play if you want to relax and have some fun, especially if you have your friends with. Finally I have to mention that there are many 2D Worms releases that are also good and viable (For Example: Worms: Reloaded).\n\nI give this game 8/10","November 18, 2014","true","3.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

It has the Worms 3D campaign as well as a new one, and tons of other new features. My Xbox One controller is working quite well, although the game didnt tell me what buttons did what. You do need a mouse or keyboard to skip the launcher.\n\nIt's definitely a charming game. I really think it could have benefitted from a little cel-shading but otherwise, it runs great, and the destructable environments make things very dynamic. Of course, most fans feel like the move to 3D made the game too unreliable to play and I tend to agree, but I'm still enjoying it. It's just a very different game. You'll find arching lobbed grenades way harder, but direct line of sight attacks are much easier to hit. And it also gives you an indicator for when melee attacks will make contact, so you won't goof them up.\n\nGood game here. I'll keep returning to it, but it wont replace the 2D Worms experience.

One mission you're destroying wind machines in order to lure out a wizard, then you're escaping from a flooding dam that was blown up by the enemy, and taking care of them. You also have to protect the Professor in some missions too! Brilliant! I haven't got to play online much, but it doesn't seem very good. Sorry guys; you know what I'm going to say, online is a ghost town.\nBut the single player kicks so much ♥♥♥ that it makes up for this.\n\nBtw guys, I found the speech bank that fits with the speech of your worms in the story mode cutscenes; it's 'Asbo Boi'. He's a dlc voice though, in the customisation pack.\n\nScore: 9.1/10","February 12","true","37.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Though this 3D title may bring a little dissapointment to those who were looking for something revolutionary.\n\nAlthough it was very nice having a refreshing HD makeover, camera upgrade and fixes, and with a new level editor, and perhaps some other small changes I haven't notice, it doesn't seem apparent that Team17's heart was into this one.  This is where unfotunatly I can't give them much credit.  Even Worms Reloaded felt more more revolutionary than this even if it was supposedly a remake of Worms Armaggedon.  Which, actually, what essientially Worms Ultimate Mayhem is.  A remake, which otherwise I would call this title Worms 4 Mayhem Reloaded.\n\nRegardless, I still recomend this any fan of the 3D series if they're looking for something a bit fresh after several years with Worms 4 Mayhem.  It's also perfect if you're someone who's looking to pick up Worms 4 Mayhem again and also an affordable price.  If you're looking for something that's really revolutionary and fresh in the Worms series, you're better off going with Worms Revolution.

If you're one of those hardcore Armageddon players who didn't really enjoy stepping into full three dimensions, this is absolutely not the game for you. As for me, since I've started my Worms saga in World Party and rapidly progressed to W4M, I think this is a welcome blast from the past.\nAlthough simple and somewhat basic, weapon creation is definitely enjoyable. Add the ability to customize your military annelids  and you've got the recipe for a good first impression. Combat takes a while to get used to, with the default setting being toggled to inverse Y axis (useful for controllers, not so much for the mouse - modify that in your settings). The W4M story has the humour I remember, putting you in the place of a team of students in a quest through time.\n\nOverall, I believe it is quite worth the price it achieves when in sales (3,24€ - about five dollars) and is enjoyable alone and with friends, be it online or on the same machine.

It merged together "Worms 3D" and "Worms 4 Mayhem", two games previously released in 2004 and 2005 (Respectively). All though the game is the same old story, the whole thing still feels fresh as when it first cames out. While the game can tend to grow fairly tedious when played by one person, if you huddle up a couple friends around the computer and break out the snacks you're bound to have a good time.\n\nMuch like its predecessors, the game takes on a humourous combat style type game on unique little landscapes. Using comedic weapons that'd you expect to see in a cartoon, you battle your way to defeat all the opposing worms. It's mindless, but at the same time fun. The game can be fairly difficult in some of the challenges, but it feels just right.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is the lack of being able to easily create / import other maps. All this game needs is a level editor and perhaps a few more character creation options and it would be amazing.

It wears it's heart on it's sleeve: It isn't an A-List game and it isn't for everyone. But for me, it's one of the most passionately developed game series ever.\n\nThings have certainly moved on since the side-scrolling invertibrate slaughter-fest of the first games to the 3D variants of the game. And whilst I did love the 2D games, I have to admit that I prefer the 3D versions. Ultimate mayhem combines the best bits of two great titles: Worms 3D and Worms 3: Mayhem, keeping all the best bits from both and removing the bad.\n\nThe customisation is absolutely fantastic: Worms with Pope hats and 3D glasses shooting bazookas at Worms with Bunny ears and disco glasses has to be one of the most hilarious things in gaming.\n\nAs I said before, it's turn-based nature and sometimes fairly difficult missions are not for everyone. But if the thought of carnage, explosions, flying sheep bombs, alien abductions, an endless array of hats and voices, air-strikes and a huge concrete donkey even makes you smile, then perhaps you should give this game a look.\n\nYou won't regret it.","August 8, 2013","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrayveRose/recommended/70600/","GrayveRose","Grayve Rose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrayveRose/","52 products in account","Summary: Wicked sick man, so sick bhro. Fun and different with the 3d, I like it more than the classic 2d approach. Online play has some serious flaws and missing features, but not enough to ruin it but still despicible.\n\nCons: Online Play:\n- Missing "Worm Pot" Modifiers, unless doing local machine play. Basically the Worm Pot is an optional system of up to 3 modifiers that you set on a Slot Machine graphic (can randomize with the lever or manually select). These modifiers include things like "Wind Affects All" or "Low Gravity", and theres quite a lot of cool modifiers you can select from. Having this missing online is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bs and is unfortunate.\n- HUGE NET DELAY. There is what seems to be about a 3-5 second delay between what you're getting on your end of the game, and the person who's turn it is. Having this out of sync basically makes it so you know what happened and perhaps on mic you reacted to it; but they still have yet to see it. So if you are laughing at some epic ♥♥♥♥ of a move, or a shameful display, others won't know until later which is really just uncomfortable more than anything else. Its like having bad reception on a phone call sort of feeling of disappointment. Thing is, how does a turn-based game have this sort of ♥♥♥♥up in the first place yo? Whoever made the online play should be fired and go back to school. Even a 300ms delay (still sucky) would be 10x better than 5 seconds delay. Any other genre outside turn-based and this would ultimately break the game, obviously. But it doesnt make it okay on this nonetheless.\n- Random lags and loading. This is not as bad as the delay issue, but it still is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Its just another side effect of having bad programming for online play. In some cases it will sit and say its loading the map but just freezes, and everyone has to F4 out and reload the game, and the host has to recreate the match. Doesnt happen often but its true ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry.\n- Creating a match in general outside of local play should have more hosting options. Its just straight up lazy and insulting and quite amateur to have just map, game style, number of private slots, and a friend invite system. Those no doubt are needed, but bare minimal if you ask me. Like stated before, the Worm Pot would be a nice beefy feature to satisfy folks like my ♥♥♥, and perhaps some other settings like a game timer override or a worm health override and some other small customizations. Those can be found as options when making a custom Game Style, but its a bit of work to go and modify an existing one or make a new one since its 7 pages or so of settings and its tucked away in a different menu of the game.\n\nOther Cons:\n- Cluster Bombs dont do nearly as much damage per cluster or direct as they should. This being a step up from a normal hand grenade it should totally be doing some more serious damage. In my opinion it should be half as strong as the Banana Bomb.\n- Beating levels should unlock weapons automatically. I played through Story past the Knights section and assumed I would get the Holy Grenade as a reward to use for online. It still wasnt showing up in the shop, and was still greyed out in the Game Style options. Not sure how they unlock weapons in the game, maybe you have to beat the game. In that case and either way, I dont think that's fair since most people are probably buying this game to play local games with friends and now (buggy ♥♥♥) online.\n- Game would be funner with more available player slots. This is more of an opinion since the Worms games have always had 4 players only. Not to mention the scale of the levels might have to go up to accomodate 6 or 8, etc; but thats not a big deal. 4 player slots fill up fast when you have friends and family around that have the game. Someone will most likely get left out of the party at some point like some kid with lice; the poor saps.\n\nPros:\n- Funny as ♥♥♥♥ like most Worms games\n- Addicting Gameplay because all the choices and dynamics that give it replay value up the ♥♥♥♥\n- Customizing Worms and the things you can buy with the in game coins is pretty diverse enough to make some funny or unique creations. My team is the Ultradouche♥♥♥♥♥♥s and they are a sight to behold.\n- Despite the online plays low-blow cop-out amateur ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, its still a lot of fun and you sort of forget those issues exists because how inviting the gameplay is (still doesnt make it okay chimpdicks!)\n- Gives you a reason to get on mic and interact and take it easy. Most the times I dont really like getting on mic, but this game is a lot better when you do with friends, even with the huge delay online.\n- Awesome and creatively diverse weapons and tools. I like dropping dynamite from the air via jetpack like a baller, or dropping a fat sumo down on the peasants below. Banana Bomb is a personal favorite though and I'm glad its still around and is still devastating.","January 2, 2015","true","26.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Edited it a little, also.\n\nI have the game on the PlayStation 3 too (don't ask why I have it for both the PC and PlayStation 3). To be honest, I prefer Worms 4: Mayhem (I only have it for the PC, pirated copy from 2005/2006). It has better game-play (it's better for battling, Roping, navigating, etc. and don't ask why, hard to explain it), better tweaks (Is it even possible to tweak Worms: Ultimate Mayhem? I have the PC version of the game and I don't know how to tweak it. There are no ".xml" files.), better music (this is my opinion, the Worms: Ultimate Mayhem music is great too, they're remixes of the old Worms 4: Mayhem tracks, but it really sucks that they took out the old Worms 4: Mayhem Sudden Death theme, they could have made a remix of that), better online play (They removed the Wormpot for online games in Worms: Ultimate Mayhem! How could they do this to us?! And you can't actually pick your own team in Worms: Ultimate Mayhem for online play, it picks one of your teams automatically, and it doesn't display the name of the team at the beginning of your turn, it simply shows your player name instead.), better HUD... They even removed the Icarus Potion Cheat in Worms: Ultimate Mayhem! I have 12 Worms games, including Worms Armageddon (the so-called "best game in the series", yes, it may be the best 2D game), and Worms 4: Mayhem was always my favorite, and Worms: Ultimate Mayhem is a very close second (and Worms 3D is third, but not that close). Yes, the new HD graphics for Worms: Ultimate Mayhem are nice, so are the new sound effects and the new "Credits" screen (it has humorous cut-scenes), and I like the Binoculars (although I was hoping for all Worms 3D weapons mixed with the Worms 4: Mayhem weapons), the new online features are also nice (such as "Ranked Match", but I still prefer the Worms 4: Mayhem online system), and they also added all the Worms 3D maps as well, along with the Worms 3D Campaign, which is very important. But, to be honest, I don't think they'll ever make a game that could top good old Worms 4: Mayhem.\n\nAs for Worms: Ultimate Mayhem, the PC and PlayStation 3 versions are equally as good. For the PC version, you could change the controls for your keyboard and controller too, which is very important. In the PlayStation 3 version, you can't change the controls for your controller, you can only choose three default sets for all controls on the controller ("Goofy", "Classic", and "Mayhem"). But for the PlayStation 3 version, there's a larger limit to the amount of characters for weapon and Game Style names, which is also very important. It also has a sufficient amount of characters for team names. For the PC version, it only has a large enough character limit for team names, not weapon or Game Style names. So, as I said, they're both equally as good.\n\nBut in general, I'd highly recommend this game. It's one of the best I've ever played.","December 24, 2014","true","29.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Also, you'll be fine with a single controller, since you just give the controller to the person who has the turn.\n\nThe music: OHMYGOSHYES!!!!! The soundtrack is just amazing.

You want to see what happens to the other worms, where they will fall, how much health they have left.

If it took itself seriously, the game would suck and suck hard. However it doesn't and it's very tongue in cheek with silly elements.  Does this make up for being boring after an hour or so? That's your call.  This game really needs a demo so you can see if it's your cup of tea or not.\n\nIt's not a good strategy game (there are better ones on steam for the same price), it's not a good action game (also better ones on steam) and it's not the best multiplayer - Co-Op game on steam (or even for it's price).  Without the houmor his game would be an easy thumbs down.  If you like this houmor, grab the game .... ideally in a bundle.

I'm a totally Worms fan and I shouldn't say anything bad about this series. Not this one. Story mode is a bit boring, but I have nothing against that. Worms 3D Campaign is frustrating (Why the hell I cannot skip the intro cutscenes?!) and sometimes broken (e.g. Sixth mission - it doesn't start because I had low FPS). Versus mode bores me. In most part, I hate aiming in Bazooka or other like this type weapons. I can easily get the opponent's worm if it isn't hidden, but if it does, is pretty hard. Throwing grenade in whatever number meters is senseless (I using them like a dynamite). Shotgun is useful only in middle and medium distances. On far distances crosshair floats and is hard to hit enemy (unless I have Sniper Rifle). Challenges are good, but too easy to beat devs' times (expect Deathmatches).\n\nEventually I would rather back to the Worms 2D interface games (such as Armageddon, Reloaded, Revolution or Clan Wars) than "torture myself" in 3D version of this series. It isn't bad, but I recommend for those who thinks that 3D version of Worms didn't harm them. For now I keep away from them.\nPros: Worms in 3D; challenges; interesting sound effects; comic particles; an interesting customization; it works\nCons: Too bad it works; too easy challenges (expect Deathmatch challenges); so-so story mode; frustrating (and sometimes broken) Worms 3D Campaign; where's the old utilities (Blow Torch, Pneumatic Drill)?; no Level Editor; Versus mode bores me than enjoy; bugs; mediocre graphics; unqueal AI; ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mines; the camera works; still it's a Worms game; BOREDOM!!!\nRate: 3,5/10\n\nPS.

Searching for a multiplayer game will dim your screen permanently, you will have to restard. The netcode is just as bad as it used to be. There's a lot of paid DLC and promo items you get for buying specific other games. The menu screen is also worse than both of the old games.\n\nWorms 3d and Worms 4 Mayhem were PS2/Xbox games. Worms Ultimate Mayhem is a repackaging for the PS3 and Xbox360. There is absolutely no point in buying this if you play on a computer. The PC optimisation is poor at best, and still non-existant for Linux and OSX.\n\nWhoever was marketing this game either had no idea what they were doing, no contact with the people making the game or lied through their teeth all the way to the bank. Whatever the case, they have definitely never played worms in their entire life.\n\nMy advice: go and seperately buy the original 2 games in a bargains corner.

Thanks for that! I should probably write more informative reviews than "this sucks"...\n\nIt was mainly the framerate that makes the game unbearable, even on the lowest settings. Considering I can run high-end games on medium settings at 30-40FPS, the 8-15FPS on this game seems a bit ridiculous. Either my graphics card can't support the graphics engine (which seems unlikely), or there's a problem with the way the game is coded that's causing some sort of drag on my computer.

Why bother? It's a big price for the only bonus being steam achievements and DLCs. If you have lots of friends to play games with you, it's a nice game to grab just to mess around, and I certainly would get it for that. It supports 4 players, which is generally all you need in a turn based game like this.\n\nI wasn't amazingly fond of the game, but that's because I've fully played both Worms 4M and Worms 3D. There's not a whole pile of content new to this game unless you buy one of the currently 3 DLCs.\n\nPost-game? Why bother. It's very hard to find anyone to play with, there's never anybody in a lobby waiting for anyone to play. You'll be expecting exaggeration until I tell you there's less than 20 people who will actively play multiplayer for this game now and then. With it not being a "new" worms title, there's never any new players to fight online.\n\nYou could play offline, sure. It's alright for a while until you actually notice some of the crazy stuff the CPU' AI manage to pull off. Have you ever managed to throw a grenade like that and hit someone point blank from across some of the larger maps without having to get it stuck in a dip in the map? No? I can say I haven't, so I don't see why these bots should do.\n\nOverall? 5/10\nFun for a while, then it just sits in your library; begging for people for you to play with.","August 8, 2014","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite fun, as pretty much all worms games have been, and it's a good refresh to the series, also.\n\nThere are cutscenes (although of quite poor quality) with humorous remarks about your next mission and so on. The 3D is OK and just because you expect it to be cartoonish, the lack of complexity is barely noticeable.\n\nThe campaign is fun and tries to make sense and create a purpose for you to just keep playing level after level, sometimes just to see what the Worm General has at bay, hidden in his invisible sleeves.\n\nI'd give this game a 7.5/10.

However, there are still a few cons in the mix with all the good that can be found in this game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Solid controls (especially on a mouse/keyboard)\n\n-Customization/weapons/gameplay lives up to the creative and wacky original Worms title\n\n-The bundle of two games, Worms 3D and Worms Mayhem, for the price of $15.00 (or $2.00-$5.00 on a steam event) is quite the deal\n\n-Narration, by Guy Harris, is hands down the best spokesman in the Worms series\n\n-Team 17 did a great job with enhancing the textures from the original 3D games (updated graphics)\n\nCons:\n\n-Like Worms party, this game was slightly crippled once it was remastered, mainly due to SOME of the added content\n\n-(Speaking of content) The DLC for this game isn't miserable, but it does fall short due to the lack of effort put into it -sorry Team 17- and the lack of DLC (Even though I did enjoy the new challenge levels)\n\n-Online matches/online play is dead (which is expected from an older game)\n\nOther than that, I would reccomend this game to any hardcore or newbie Worms fan.\nGood luck Team 17, I'm really looking forward to more of your work.","November 28, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember I was excited when they made a 3D one. And I remember it had bad reviews. Now it was a good opportunity to try this game as it was in Humble Bundle. And it is not a bad game. It have its difficulties in its controls, I hate the FPS view starts based on the camera not based on the worm's position, and movement in 3D space with sensitive camera like this is a little clunky. But it is playable and enjoyable.\n\nIt even have a story mode that worth a play through. It makes you use most of the tools and weapons so it works like a tutorial too. The story is somehow bizarre and violent, it teaches you that everything is solvable with weapons :D\n\nIt has the feel of a worms game. It is a worms game.

The picture in picture with weapon shots is a very nice touch.\nThe customization so far is pretty decent, though I am not done unlocking everything,  I am satisfied if there is more unlocks available later.

Music is nice, although the title screen music gets on your nerves fast.\nMission music is better.\n\nWeapons (and equipment) are in good ol worms fashion, with additions to the lineup.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BEARBOP/recommended/70600/","BEARBOP","Sock-Em' Bop-Em' Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BEARBOP/","8 products in account","I have a soft spot for the "3D-Worms series", so it only seems fit that I give this one a fair (slightly biased) review.\nWorms Ultimate Mayhem may be considered old by now, but it still seems to hold up as an all time favorite of mine.  Even with the newer fanchise of games (Worms Revolution, Worms Clan Wars, and the upcoming Worms W.M.D) W.U.M is a guideline for ALL 3D Worms tie-ins.  However, there are still a few cons in the mix with all the good that can be found in this game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Solid controls (especially on a mouse/keyboard)\n\n-Customization/weapons/gameplay lives up to the creative and wacky original Worms title\n\n-The bundle of two games, Worms 3D and Worms Mayhem, for the price of $15.00 (or $2.00-$5.00 on a steam event) is quite the deal\n\n-Narration, by Guy Harris, is hands down the best spokesman in the Worms series\n\n-Team 17 did a great job with enhancing the textures from the original 3D games (updated graphics)\n\nCons:\n\n-Like Worms party, this game was slightly crippled once it was remastered, mainly due to SOME of the added content\n\n-(Speaking of content) The DLC for this game isn't miserable, but it does fall short due to the lack of effort put into it -sorry Team 17- and the lack of DLC (Even though I did enjoy the new challenge levels)\n\n-Online matches/online play is dead (which is expected from an older game)\n\nOther than that, I would reccomend this game to any hardcore or newbie Worms fan.\nGood luck Team 17, I'm really looking forward to more of your work.","November 28, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a worm, your job? To kill the opposing worms. Obviously, the main  components in this game is multiplayer, but there's a few other modes for people who can't use multiplayer.... for particular reasons.\n\nLet's get right into the multiplayer! The multiplayer works just like every other worms game in the series, turn based. One player goes first, attacks... or not, depends, and then after they have either attacked or ran out of time, the next player goes. Before you start a match though, there's a slot machine, that can be used to randomly select 3 twists to add to your game, your you can choose them yourself! These twists are really interesting, and make every game different from the last. Some of them are; not being able to use anything but ranged weapons, you can only move using the grappling hook,or only being able to use weapons from crates! The online mode is basically the same thing, but no slot machine, and so is single player battles, except you play against a computer.\n\nThe campaign is by far my favourite part of the game. At the start of each level, you are given an objective, e.g. destroy the building, kill the enemies, climb the tower, all that kind of stuff you would expect. The variety of different levels really keep things fresh, from a dinosaur attack, to the old western, nothing ever seems dull. At the end of each level though, you get coins, which can be used to buy things for your worms in the shop.\n\nThe shop is where you can buy more things to customize your worms. You see, before you start the actual game, you should make yourself a team. You can name your team members, dress them up, and even choose a speech bank to make them sound like English Bobby,  or even a robot! Not only can you buy things to customize your worm with in the store, but you can also buy new premade levels based on the single player missions to use in multiplayer, or even new game modes! There is also a whole load of items you can only unlock if you own other games on your steam account though.\n\nIn the end, worms ultimate mayhem is tons of fun with friends, also a whole load of fun in single player,  and with the immense variety of levels and customization options, you will not get bored soon.\n\nMy final rating is... 8.5/10","November 29, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a steep learning curve initially, but an absolute blast with loads of options including one player battles against bots.","December 28, 2011","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot customization in it, and there's also lot of maps and weapons to use on your enemies. Controls take a while to get used too, since this one's in 3D, unlike the others, but they aren't too hard to get used to. Probably not as good as Worms: Reloaded or Armageddon, but still worth a try.\n\nJust a small warning, though. The online for this game is pretty much dead, so if you're looking for online play for this game, you might as well skip it and go for the others, instead.","May 28","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grab your friends and blow eachother up and laugh when you die funny and stupid ways. The worms games have always been fun for that sole purpose... finding amusing and creative ways to maim eachothers worms and send them to their doom. Single player is okay, but I recommend buying this for yourself and gifting a copy to a gamer friend to play it with.","June 2","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now owning Ultimate Mayhem, I can play the games again and have fun with all the crazy things the worms say and do.\n\nMy only complaint is that in the Worms 4 Mayhem version I owned, I was able to obtain coins for the shop by using game styles I made/modified.  In the Ultimate Mayhem version, however, that is not the case.","June 2","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also adore the fact that Team17 included the Worms: 3D campaign because playing some of the older levels makes me very nostalgic :3\n\nScore: 10/10","June 5","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
