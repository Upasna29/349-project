"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/258070/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","The simple action of a platformer with a touch of roguelike complexity. From the mind behind Starseed Pilgrim, Probability 0 takes the straight-forward yet challenging run n' jump gameplay of platformers like VVVVVV and stirs the formula up by applying the dynamically randomized levels, skills, and enemies of the roguelite genre (Spelunky, Risk of Rain) for an end result that is infinitely replayable and impossible to master.\n\nThe challenge in P0 is refreshing, while a lot of your runs will quickly end in your swift and humiliating failure the few runs you do make it far on will feel that much more rewarding and satisfying. There are loads of powerups to play around with all located on a large and expansive skill tree that you are able to upgrade between each level you manage to surpass. Every choice will have a huge impact on how you play and every player will find their own unique path of skills on the tree to succeed by.\n\nThe game has a simple but abstract and almost horror look with a great atmosphere. There's a large variety of creepy creature designs, dark and moody colors, and a rapidly changing Probability message scrawled at the top of your screen to remind you of your impending doom. The soundtrack alines perfectly and feels dark and ominous for something so 8-bit and catchy, fitting with the mood of the game just right.\n\nAt less than ten dollars, Probability 0 is an easy buy for all fans of platforming and random roguelike elements and will be remembered by me along with the most famous of indie titles from this era.","June 13, 2014","true","6.9"," 47 of 59 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","47","59","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nillo42/recommended/258070/","nillo42","Nymlus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nillo42/","1220 products in account","Probability 0 is an elegantly designed little roguelike platformer. It puts you in the shoes of an unnamed dungeon delver who has absolutely no chance of surviving the adventure, as you might have surmised from the game's title. Instead, the focus of the game is simply to delay your inevitable death for as long as possible.\n\nThere's no traditional life bar, but you can roughly tell how much health you have left by two things. One is the "probability number" near the middle of the screen, which constantly fluctuates between various encouraging statistics such as the "chance in a million that you will ever see your family again". The second way to tell how close you are to death is that the music becomes increasingly intense, and a siren can be heard in the distance. Is it the song of the valkyrie coming to take you to Valhalla, perhaps, or the grating sound of Hell's gates swinging wide in front of you? The same siren can be heard when a boss monster appears. Coincidentally, that is also the moment where you are most likely to die.\n\nWith its branching skill tree and randomized levels, the game has much replay value. Thankfully so, because each run through the game is extremely short. Progress is measured in minutes rather than hours, and a newbie might simply perish by falling off the platform they started on. You may begin to feel burned out after dying many times in a row, so I think this game is best suited for coffee breaks, or as a filler played in between other activities. What I find most enjoyable is to simply play two or three runs each session, and then stop for a while to let the lessons learned from those runs sink into my mind.\n\nIn short: If you're looking for a platformer that challenges you without wasting your time, Probability 0 is an excellent choice. It generally takes only a few minutes for your character to die, but it leaves you with the feeling of wanting to try again and to do better next time. To exact vengeance upon your killer. To see your family again... well, the probability of that happening is zero, but it's worth trying.","June 13, 2014","true","1.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","5"

It's pure, accessible, deep, and has an eerie, mysterious vibe to it. The platforming and combat both start out really simple, and are continuously expanded upon through new abilities (like firing your ranged projectile in new directions, being able to stomp your enemies, smash otherwise solid blocks, just to name a few). It's worth mentioning that the skill tree is extremely refined and well-designed. It feels balanced, interesting, and allows for an astounding amount of customization and experimentation at the same time.\n\nEnemies start off really simple, but as you get deeper, the spawn pool gets mixed up with very interesting critters that drastically differ in their movement, attack pattern and other behaviour. Since each enemy and environmental hazard is extremely easy to grasp and learn, death is rather caused by multiple of these elements driving you into situations you didn't calculate. Each death, even if they are very frequent, feels more than deserved - an aspect lacking in quite a number of other games.\n\nI would definitely recommend Probability 0 to everyone who likes a good challenge. It can be frustrating, but in the most positive way a game can be. It's pure in its design, fun to play and very rewarding.\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","6.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

(you also lose 1 level of Karma each time you do a Karma run, but it's not terribly hard to regain the level by playing Beginner/Expert a few times.)\n\nin this mode, collecting the orbs enemies leave after death is the object -- which makes it the most difficult thing, especially since Karma mode teems with enemies who can easily get in the way of scoring the spoils of recent kills.\n\nin short, it's very replayable and lots of fun.  my only real regret is that it doesn't have more variety of music,  but that's not such a big deal, as the music that it DOES have totally fits the action.","June 23, 2014","true","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There's less of a setup and more of a high-concept motif here, with your silhouetted pixel man descending into a never-ending pit of darkness, battling strange monsters along the way. You start out only punching and slinging stars downward, but defeating enemies levels you up and allows you to select from dozens of new abilities across several tiers. There's space for some actual builds here, such as ones heavy on punching, or stars, or defense, or contact damage, and so on.\n\nDespite the advancement options, there's not much variety of gameplay to use them on. You'll encounter more and stranger monsters the further down you go but the basic structure of the pit doesn't change from assortments of blocks and spikes. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it just strays closer to an infinite runner than, well, Downwell. The fixed scrolling also means your pace is mostly dictated by the game, making Probability 0 feel the more measured and technical of the two.\n\nThe title refers to the game's most unique aspect, the probabilities that constantly flash across the upper center of the screen. This is essentially your health, as the random probabilities decrease as you get hit, from six digits all the way down to singles. It's a clever touch that really supports the surreal, striking feel of the game you get from the stark graphics and steady, low-fi soundtrack. There's two difficulties to tackle plus a mode where you can get a head-start based on your previous records, but again, not a lot of variety between runs aside from your builds. As long as you're okay with that, though, there's a pretty good chance you'll enjoy this one.","February 27","true","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The enemies move randomly and are very difficult to hit, and since the progression - at least of Beginner Mode - is done by how many enemies defeated it makes the game pretty frustrating. Also, the controls are fiddly, meaning you'll slip off platforms, walk into enemies and generally not do what you want to do. Also also, there's fall damage and a lot of the time it's unavoidable.\n\nAltogether it plays more like a budget flash game.

The only real goal of the game is to survive as long as possible as the game automatically scrolls downwards. You build up a score based on the number of monsters you defeat while descending, and you level up with the experience points that the monsters drop. Leveling up gives you new skills that will increase your chances of survival, but the odds are always stacked against you. In fact, there's 0% chance you'll beat the game.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, but tough to master. At the start, your combat abilities are shooting stars beneath you while airborne and punching. Both are pretty weak, but as you gain new skills, you'll become more formidable. There's a wide variety of monsters to face, each with unique patterns and abilities. Touching them knocks you around unpredictably, exposing you to other dangers below. If you get far enough, you'll even face tough boss enemies! The game's challenge is always in a constant state of pressure: you have to avoid getting crushed by the scrolling ceiling above while taking care not to fall into the abyss without a platform.\n\nThe game's real charm comes from its aesthetic. It features simple pixel graphics with a soundtrack that pulses and screams as you get closer to death. Your chances of success are constantly shown on the screen instead of a health counter, while the distance you've traveled is recorded in all sorts of different units. Everything is incredibly cute, which fits Droqen's style from past games, like Starseed Pilgrim.\n\nUnfortunately, Probability 0 still has its fair share of problems. There's no native controller support, and the dev doesn't seem to be responsive to players on Steam's forums. Droqen has seemed to have moved on to other projects and isn't interested in offering support. The game's engine was done in Flash, which isn't particularly favored by many players. Personally, it lags a bit for me. Some may find the game's unconventional systems to be a turn off: there's no HP display other than your odds, and the habit of monsters knocking you around is pretty frustrating. Finally, a lot of people will probably find the price to be quite steep for what it is. I'm not sure what to say to really justify its price other than that it was a true labor of love by a humble indie game developer and that it's a pretty fun score-chaser.\n\nTL; DR: For fans of Downwell, TowerClimb, Just Get Through, Spelunky, and other roguelike platformers.","September 26, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is unforgiving even in the 'Beginner' difficulty. You don't have a health bar in the traditional sense, instead the game prominently displays the 'probabilities' of several events occuring. Events such as: 'Choices resulting in a second chance', 'Chance in one million that you escape unharmed' or 'Ways to achieve anything but death'. As you take damage the numbers displayed for each of the events slowly approach zero. When the probabilities reach zero, you die.\n\nIn the standard game modes, you either break blocks or kill enemies to gather stars, when you gather enough stars you get an upgrade and there is a subsequent increase in difficulty. The game also increases in difficulty as you slowly descend. And descend you must, as the screen slowly scrolls down. If you go too far off the screen vertically you will automatically die. You will also automatically die if you fall off the screen and touch an area of the bottom border where there are no blocks to stand on.\n\nThere is a free demo available to play, which I would recommend doing if you're considering a purchase.

I enjoy speed-run and time-attack games well enough, but for me there is a unique pleasure in trying to hold out for as long as possible. This is a particularly good example of the genre, and it captures much of the magic that was pioneered by classic examples like Donkey Kong. In Beginner and Expert modes, every game is a fresh start. This makes runs comparable -- no need to wonder "did I only do better because I unlocked something?" -- which is essential in a high score game. The unlockable "Karma" mode is very comparable as well, because there are only ten levels of unlocks, and you unlock them fairly quickly by playing the other two modes.\n\nSome of the mechanics in this game feel downright un-fair. Your projectiles have a tiny hitbox, while you have a rather large one, so it's a common occurrence to throw a star straight down, miss, fall straight down after it, and be hit by the monster that your star had missed. Projectiles also travel downward a bit slower than you do, so it's possible to pass them on the way down. The distance required to trigger fall damage is quite small. Getting hit sends you into a stun animation that can launch you quite far, sometimes it will throw you helplessly to the bottom of the screen, which is instant death.\n\nThey seem unfair, but they are surmountable. Developing the level of precision and quick-thinking that this game demands has been incredibly satisfying. Much like Starseed Pilgrim, another game by the same developer, this game presents challenges that seem impossible, which makes it all the more rewarding when you finally figure out how to overcome them.\n\nThe main flaws are a lack of leaderboards and controller support. Joy2Key mostly overcomes the controller issue, but it is less convenient. The lack of leaderboards is disappointing, but it focuses the game on the learning process rather than the competition, and ultimately the learning process is where this game's greatest strengths lie.","January 29, 2015","true","52.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a small guy trying to fall down a hole, like many classic lame old video games. You only have arms when you throw your basic ninja stars, which you collect from plants on the ground, or one of the 3 possible orbs that burst out of your dead enemies. The other one is a heart orb, which heals you, or a basic orb, which does nothing special. When you get a certain amount of orbs, you level up. When you level up, the game pauses for a second. You can now pick a new skill. Now you need more orbs to level up. Rinse and repeat in epic fun.\n\nPros:\nEpic music, something to survive for.\nI personally like the graphics, but it might not appeal to all.\nA karma mode, which levels up as you die in normal mode, the higher the level, the more upgrades you can get on the start, but it goes down one level for every play.\nA large variety of enemies and upgrades, making it feel fresh every time, although it seems a bit stale if you aren't very good.\n\nCons:\nRandom probabilities flashing by too fast to read (once you die, it says something like: "probability of being brought back to life: 0")\nNormal mode scores by amount of orbs collected, and I'd prefer it to go by how far down you went (expert mode scores it on that, but its very hard)\nJust difficult all around.\nRandom terrain generator could've been a small bit better, as in no traps. although this is probably purposeful.\n\n7.5/10, small game, but very fun and original.","January 4, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You saw the trailer.\n\nBalance in single player games is something I've come to value more and more over time. I've seen too many games where one weapon or upgrade is simply the best, not even a matter of preference, and choosing anything else is tantamount to shooting yourself in the foot. Using the best option feels awful, and using a worse option on purpose feels like I'm putting in more work for worse results. I was worried that this would be one of those because I immediately said "THIS skill is the obvious choice", but if an upgrade seems like an obvious choice do yourself a favor and try the other ones too. Every single upgrade rocks the foundation of the game in a good way. The best games make every option feel like a game-breaker, but keep everything balanced. The lower tier skills are often just as tempting as the higher ones. This sounds like a small thing, but it's so satisfying to pick a useless skill and see it's great, or skip a absolutely necessary skill and see it isn't.\n\nThe platforming seems simple, but small details make it deep. The jump height, block size, and overall physics of the game are calibrated to give you as many choices as possible. This part is difficult to explain, but since the game is made of blocks in a grid pattern, block configurations can reoccur. The hang time on the jump is such that you can JUST clear a two-block gap with a ceiling overhead. The ceiling prevents you from getting the height you usually need to get across, making it difficult. But since it's a grid layout any time you see blocks arranged that way, it's the same exact jump, allowing practice to carry over. The punch hit-box is just enough that if you stand on the VERY edge of a block you can hit a block one block away. The grid size is just enough that you can jump off the edge of a block without bumping into the one directly overhead. Things like that. Little maneuvers that are tricky, practicable, and help you last a little longer if pulled off. If the physics were a tiny bit different, lots of maneuvers would go from "It's possible, but tricky" to "It's impossible", limiting your choices as a player.\n\nAside from the skill descriptions, very little is explained. I didn't expect much, but there was and still is a ton to discover. Several times I thought I had seen every enemy type, only to find another. Every skill has some additional detail purposely not mentioned in the description. Curiosity is really a one time feeling, but even after all this time there are still things I want to know. Is there something hiding down the Expert pit? Is there an ending? Is THAT bug actually intentional?\n\nAn unassuming, 12 MB, app-like game, but one of the most engaging I've seen.","July 6, 2015","true","71.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't spent too much time in this game, but gosh is it hard. I've decked a good hour or so into the game, but it takes the rouge-like to a new level of hard. The screen is constantly descending deeper, and you're tryting to keep up, but you have to grab some more star-ammo, dare you risk going for the ammo? Or should you play it safe? Now, imagine you're a time lord, and you go for option A, you rush across the screen, and  grab the ammo, but the screen passes and you die. Now, rewind time and go for B. You descend deeper succesfully, but are flanked by two flying foes, who basically bite you to death. This is Probability 0. The game has a certain old-school difficulty not successfully pulled very often today, and its by the creators of Starseed Piligrim. Overall, I'd say if you really like old-school titles, buy it, if not, wait for it to go on sale. It's a great game(Would be better with local coop.), but the price tag is a tad hyperbole.","July 1, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
