If you're coming from Skyrim or Oblivion, you're probably used to having a full set of armor, a decent weapon or spell, knowledge of basic combat, and a fair amount of gold and potions before you even start exploring the world. Morrowind isn't like that. You start the game by stepping off of a boat in a poor swamp town with nothing but the clothes on your back and a rusty iron dagger. There is no fast traveling (or at least no free fast traveling), and the map can sometimes be confusing. The only way you can find what you're looking for sometimes is by reading vague directions your character wrote down in their journal. In Skyrim, Alduin appears before you even have control of your character. In Oblivion, the emperor tells you of Mehrunes Dagon's plot before you leave the first dungeon. In Morrowind, you don't even learn the main plot of the game until you're a few hours into it, and even then you don't have all the information. Many people would consider these things to be negative, or at least intimidating, but in reality I wouldn't have it any other way. If you can get past the dated mechanics and look, I remain convinced that this is the greatest Elder Scrolls game, and my favorite game of all time. The story is wonderful, the lore might possibly be the greatest in all of fiction, the world is wonderfully diverse and detailed, and there is a sense of freedom and magic that makes even games like Skyrim feel constained in comparison. Another incredible thing is that the modding community is still strong 13 years later, meaning that nearly every problem you could have with this game (including the borderline infamous dicerolling) can be fixed. This game is truly a masterpiece and a must play if you are a fan of RPGs. Although your character starts so low, lower than any other RPG I've ever played, the feeling of satisfaction you get when you win is indescribable. You truly feel like a God, and the NPCs treat you the same. There is a reason so many people still rave about this game so many years later, and while it is intimidating, it is without a doubt worth the effort.","June 17, 2015","true","329.3"," 817 of 829 people (99%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","99","817","829","29","17"

You pick a race, class, go through the tutorial and dive right in. The controls are a bit clunky and you feel a bit awkward swinging around the first dagger you get. Well screw it, let’s see what this game has to offer. So you go up to the first enemy you see, a mudcrab. You start hacking away at it, only to find that you miss almost 90% of the time. Finally after getting hit a few times you dispatch it. Well, that didn’t go as well as you expected. Then you realize that even when running you are moving at a snail's pace and you are constantly very low on fatigue. You get your hands on better weapons and armour, but you still miss often and take more damage than you expect. Despite all  this, you play on. You get your first side quest, and then you realize that objectives aren’t marked on your map nor are you notified when they are completed. Then you find other tedious things, your magic doesn’t regenerate, there isn’t a fast travel system*, spells can fail, equipment can break, etc. At long last you snap. You run around cursing the day you ever thought it was a good idea to purchase this game in a blood-curdling scream. But for whatever reason you play on, maybe you want to see if you can get the slightest satisfaction out of the money you’ve invested, maybe a small part of you likes the game, or maybe you want to add more play time so your multi-paragraph rant about why you shouldn’t play this game will be taken more seriously.\n\nThen something magical happens, you get a few level ups and your skills improve. You start figuring out how to keep your health up without constantly purchasing potions. You start paying close attention to the quest instructions and find that they aren’t so difficult to follow. You finally start hitting more than you miss and with every hit you land and every creature you slay you get a burst of adrenaline. You grow stronger and start making short work of enemies that once made mincemeat out of you, laughing triumphantly in your sweet revenge. You start moving much faster than you ever thought you would. But that was just the beginning. You then find yourself paying close attention to the side quests and the people of Morrowind and suddenly you’ve completely immersed yourself in a game that has graphics optimized from the N64 era, but that no longer matters. The controls that once baffled you become completely second-nature. The combat that once was infuriating becomes so great you will charge at every enemy you spot.** The magic system that once seemed impossible suddenly seems like the only way a magic system should work. Even the most trivial interactions become satisfying, and at long last all the troubles you had in the past with this game make complete sense.\n\nUnfortunately Morrowind isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay. It’s no exaggeration that this game takes a LOT of patience to get into. You begin with selecting races you’re not familiar with and making choices for your character without any knowledge about all they ways they will affect you throughout the game. Then, you are put through a brief tutorial and are thrust right into the game with only an item for the first main quest and a dagger. The rest you will have to look up online or learn through experience. But don’t be discouraged, as this game get’s extremely enjoyable once you get out of the ‘rut’ of the first chunk of the game. Once you finally get a good understanding of how everything works you finally start to see that things that once frustrated you are there for good reason. The customization level of this game is extensive, more extensive than Oblivion or Skyrim. Not that those are bad games, but Morrowind offers a deeper and more challenging experience. You have plenty of classes to choose from, you can make your own class, and you choose a birthsign which can augment your stats or grant you new abilities, further increasing the amount of character builds to experiment with. Overall, if you’ve got a lot of free time on your hands and want to play through an deep and immersive RPG, I cannot recommend Morrowind enough.\n\nPros:\n+Very immersive open world\n+Plenty of ways to build your character\n+Background Music is subtle yet very catchy\n+Deep Stat/skill development\n+Rock Solid Gameplay, takes some getting used to\n\nCons:\n-Takes a large amount of time to get used to gameplay and controls\n-Outdated Graphics (Can be fixed with the right mods)\n-Sound Effects are a bit lacking (Fixed with Mods)\n\nDon’t like the lacking sound and graphics of Morrowind? Use this mod compilation, it’s safe and easy to install:\nhttp://www.ornitocopter.net/morrowind-overhaul/mgso-release/\n\n* There is a Fast travel system of sorts. (As Nerf mentioned earlier) The Mage’s guild allows you to warp to any other Mage’s guild building. The Silt Striders (Giant mountable insects) let you ride to almost any town. Also you can use intervention spells to warp you to the nearest temple, fortress, etc. When you get further in the game you can use exotic means of transportation such as jumping/levitating across the entire island. Bottom line is, just because there’s no fast travel doesn’t mean you can’t conveniently get places\n\n** Morrowind is often criticized as having a “God-awful” combat system. I have yet to figure out why but the complaint I hear a lot is the fact that you can miss, and early game you will miss a lot. I actually loved this. The higher your agility stat and weapon skill the more often you will hit. This motivated me to try and improve my weapon skills so that I could hit more often. Plus I feel like the health of enemies was lowered to compensate for this. Most of the early enemies will go down in a few hits so long as you're using your most effective attacks. So even early game when you miss a lot fights don’t last too much longer than they would in Skyrim where you hit every time. Point is, the combat system is something I love, but you might not enjoy it.","February 9, 2015","true","383.8"," 779 of 792 people (98%) found this review helpful 154 people found this review funny","98","779","792","154","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cilliswillis/recommended/22320/","cilliswillis","de_fault","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cilliswillis/","227 products in account","My opinionated review for: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\nDisclaimer : I have played all of the TES games in reverse order so my praise for the game is not pure nostalgia. Also most of my time playing this game has not been on Steam, but rather the disc version I bought from a movie & music store long ago. I believe I have put a total of 500+ hours on that version alone.\n\nGameplay: This game is the pinnacle of the TES saga. Every RPG element is here and works well. Upon startup, you are greeted with a rather bland title screen. What makes it so special is the iconic theme of Morrowind that has appeared by variation in all of the later TES games. Clicking new game will send start a skippable intro video and then the game starts. Your backstory is that you were sent to Vvardenfell under the orders of the emporer. This backstory is vague enough for you to be creative with your story, unlike Fallout 3 or Oblivion. You will be awoken by a Dunmer named "Juib" who then asks you for your name. This is the character creation process. You will then select one of 10 races, a class, and a birthsign. It is short and sweet enough to not be annoying like Skyrim's god-long intro sequence. You will collect your papers and orders from the census offices and then you're off. No intro dungeon. No forced story. Nothing. This is where most people are lost. They are so used to the handholding from the newer TES games. You will have to read your journal for info. So you open it up and it says to deliver a package to some guy in Balmora? Where is Balmora? Players will then proceed to run around and then get killed by a mudcrab because they don't understand the stat based combat. That is the beauty of this game. Nothing will be handed to you except insults for being an outlander. What would you do in this situation? Ask for directions of course. The dialogue system is made so that you can ask a npc about almost everything that your character knows of. Unlike Skyrim's 3 phrases that nobody cares about, you can ask about secrets,rumors,services,work, about the dungeon you just delved, an assassin that attacked you, and even a weird dream that you may have had. It is very in-depth. There is also a disposition system where you can ahave enemies based on race,guild, or even for the fact that you are a criminal! Not everyone will be your friend, just like real life, so stay close to those who you trust. You have a diverse range of skills that are all useful in their own ways. You cannot master them all, so train wisely! Attributes are availiable as well, unlike Skyrim. This game is a true RPG, so don't expect action based combat. If you wonder why you can't hit anyone, it is because you are not properly trained with the current weapon you are using. It makes more sense if you think about it. Some may say it is extremely boring and tedious, but I say it is fair, seeing how you should not be able to pick up a weapon and automatically start killing with it. If you prefer to stay out of conflict, there is a great alchemy system availiable. You have multiple tools to mess with and to this day, I still haven't fully understood the sytem. There are many other systems in the game but I cannot fully explain them all or we'll be here for days.\n\nArt: In order to judge and old game's graphics in a modern day, you must compare other games that came out the same year. Going by that, I say the game looked fairly well. It has a lot to look at and read (tons of books availiable!) and while the animations may be a little unbelievable and robotic, they get the job done. One thing you may notice about Morrowind compared to other RPG's, is how alien it feels. That is the prime charm of Morrowind. Think Japanese culture mixed with Mayan culture. There are not a lot of video settings available, so you may need to download Morrowind Graphics Extender if you want to fully customise the graphics and short view distance and low fov.\n\nMusic/Sound: This game has one of the best soundtracks ever. Composed by Jeremy Soule, every track is movie quality and always keeps a great feeling inside. It adds to the atmosphere in a big way. The sound design is great as well, although ambience is rather dead, the music makes up for it. The voice acting is top notch, although sometimes non-existent, or maybe I'm just spoiled by Skyrim.\n\nEntertainment Value: Like any other TES game, you can sink an infinite amount of hours into it. There is always something new to explore in Morrowind, a new dungeon, new npc, new weapon, etc. I consider it the best in the series followed by Skyrim. If you are an RPG fan and you don't care if you have to put in a little work to enjoy what this game has to offer, you will most likely enjoy what Morrowind has to offer. And if you are not pleased with how the game looks or plays, there is an active modding community available that will fix every issue you have.\n\nScore:\nI love Morrowind to death, so of course this review was biased, but I feel you cannot help but enjoy the land of Morrowind just like me. With Skywind coming soon, we may get another chance to explore this land once again.\n\n5/5\nThank you for reading.","October 26, 2014","true","47.3"," 805 of 832 people (97%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","97","805","832","28","40"

I hope our ongoing relationship (12 years now!) never ends. I remember our first meeting. I went to GameStop in 2002 with a little extra Christmas money. I was holding you and another game, Shenmue 2, and having a hard time deciding which to take home to my Xbox. I ultimately decided on you and I'm a better person for it.\n\nI still think about the first time I stepped off the boat onto Vvardenfell and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. No quest arrow pointers, no direction. I was just supposed to do whatever I felt like. The very idea was mind-boggling and so hardcore. My first trip down the road toward Pelagiad, then on to Balmora, Caldera, and Ald-Ruhn. It was days before I even started the main quest. I rolled a few characters and we had a lot of fun times, but then you changed. Yes you changed, for the better, when you decided to show me so much more with your Game of the Year release on Xbox.\n\nThe game I had already spent hundreds, possibly thousands, of hours in had nearly doubled in size. I still hadn't even done everything there was to do in the base game, but I knew I would come back evetually, so I moved on the expansions. We had so much fun together. I never imagined it could get any better.\n\nBut then, I got a PC. Oh, how I never even dreamed of the possibilities. Mods. Mods everywhere. The Unofficial Patch. Better Bodies. Morrowind Graphics Extender. I was never very shallow and didn't mind how you looked, but these and hundreds of other mods, no thousands, showed your true potential.\n\nWe've had our ups-and-downs. There's been times I have looked through old saves and realized I haven't spent time with you in over a year, but I know you'll always be there waiting. I'll admit I've cheated on you with your younger siblings. I know I'm a terrible person.\n\nI fell victim to the sway and promises of Oblivion, but it was too easy. It showed where to go and what to do. It gave me less armor and weapon choices. It tried to limit my experience. It was cold-hearted. While it was fun, it was really just a fling.\n\nI went back to you for awhile, but then Skyrim released. Sure it was new and flashy, it looked gorgeous, but that's not what it's about. It was even easier than Oblivion. So after another fling and another lesson learned, I went back to you yet again.\n\nI've purchased you 4 times over now (Xbox vanilla, Xbox GOTY, PC GOTY, Steam GOTY) and I've still never experienced all you have to offer.\n\n----------\n\nEnvironment: 10 - From the shores of Dagon Fel to the sprawling city of Vivec. From the streets of Mournhold to the Clockwork City. Very few words can describe the magnitude of the environment - sprawling is the first that comes to mind. Go anywhere you want. The sky's the limit. No really, it's the only limit.\n\nControls: 7 - Look up, look down. Strafe left, strafe right. Pretty basic setup. Combat may be clunky, but mods exist to make it better if you want. It's an action RPG, but an RPG none the less. Stat based combat means not everything willl hit every time.\n\nGameplay: 10 - Essentially, Morrowind allows you to do what you want, when you want. Play the game however you feel like. Don't feel like ever completing the main quest line? No problem. You might even forget it's there like I did. Want to kill off an important NPC that's part of the main quest line? No worries there either. There's even a work-around quest line that will still allow you to finish the main quest line if your prefer.\n\nEntertainment: 10 - Become a member of the Thieve's Guild and steal your way to the top. Rise through the ranks of the Fighter's Guild and earn your place. Join one of the three political houses for some intrigue. Go on a walk-about and see what there is to see.  You might run into a naked Nord that has been bewitched or you could possibly encounter a group of bandits. There is so much going on in this game, you just have to explore to experience some of the random and crazy things out there.\n\nReplayability: 10 - I've spent many, many hours in this game, and have only played a total of four characters. I still want to start a new character at some point. I hope that explains the score well enough.\n\nGraphics: 7 - At release, it was gorgeous. Compared to modern games, it's not much to look at. If you're a shallow Hal, there's plenty of mods available to spruce things up a bit.\n\n----------\n\nIf you've never played an Elder Scrolls game before, you have no idea what you're missing. If you started with either Oblivion or Skyrim, you have no idea what you're missing. A lot of gamers agree (no source) that Morrowind is the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series and I agree. Do yourself a favor and get the game.\n\nMost important is give it some time. After the short intro scene, you're on your own. You decide where to go and what to do. You decide how to play the game. The learning curve can seem a bit steep, but believe when I say say very simply, it's worth it.\n\n----------\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n- If you're questioning my listed hours on record, I just purchased this on the Steam 2014 Holiday Sale (12/22/2014). However, as listed above, I have spent quite a bit of time with Morrowind outside of Steam. Give it some time and the hours will begin to climb substantially.\n\n-No, I'm not truly in love with this game nor do I have some sort of abnormal gamer fetish. It's just a game I love to play that is the top of my personal "best games" list. Suprisingly to some, I do actually have a wife and kids.","December 22, 2014","true","68.7"," 701 of 721 people (97%) found this review helpful 286 people found this review funny","97","701","721","286","22"

Easily better than the previous installments, and its direct sequel, and a good debate on whether or not it is better than Skyrim. I would be in the camp to say it is better. Skyrim is nothing to mess with though, as it is an amazing game in its own right. Both have their strong points. But the weak points for Skyrim are mainly only things that were not introduced yet until later Elder Scrolls titles. The weak points for the followups would be things that sadly got nerfed later on, to make the games more console friendly. In any event, I think Morrowind is fantastic. And it has after 11 years aged wonderfully.\n\nSo what Morrowind, and its brethren are, would be best described as a massive open world single player role playing game. A game with a world so massive you could spend hundreds of hours, and still discover new things. Virtually every building and room can be entered. There are full towns, castles, keeps, crypts, dungeons, temples, and a wide assortment of other places to explore. There is a nice lengthy 20 hour main storyline, and a number of side quests that could add hundreds of more hours onto the main quest. There are guilds and factions to join. Friends to make and even more enemies to take on.\n\nThe other great thing that helps flesh out how huge the game can be would be the player. You can be pretty much whatever you want in terms of class. You can use a wide variety of preset classes, or create your own from scratch. And from there evolve it into something completely different. And there are many races to choose from, each with varying impacts on quest lines and character interactions. You can be a pure warrior. A thief. A magic user. And much much more. You can rob people. Help people. Be the local hero. Be a fiend and murder an entire town. Become famous or notorious. It's all up to you. And of course, like other Elder Scrolls games, you become shunned by being a vampire, werewolf, or carrier of a disease.\n\nThe level progression in The Elder Scrolls is handled through a number of ways. You can level up by a wide variety of skills. Not just for killing things. You could level up merely by boosting your sneak skill, or acrobatics, or whatever else. And each time you level up, the world scales with you. So enemies become more fierce. But so do you. And not to worry, as along the way you'll discover many new weapons, and magical abilities to mix and match to complete your personal arsenal. One thing I enjoy about the magic is that Morrowind allows you to custom create spells, giving you a near infinite potential to creating the perfect spells.\n\nVisually, Morrowind has aged decently, but with the use of visual mods, the game can look on par with even Oblivion in terms of world detail. Which is not at all bad I must say. In the sound department, there are only a few tracks, but they get the job done right, and are easily going to be memorable for those that play for more than a few hours.\n\n11 years later, and this still remains as one of the best Western RPGs to date. It's never too late to get into Morrowind.","November 25, 2013","true","23.7"," 933 of 1,009 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","933","1","0","38"

I hadn't even heard of a "mod", and this was the best game I'd ever played. I had so much fun exploring every nook and cranny I could find, I only ever touched the main quest once, then scrapping it after a glitch in the game prevented me from talking to the Ashlanders.\n\nFast forward ~9 years later.\n\nI picked up the Elder Scrolls Anthology, downloaded all my games and installed Arena/Daggerfall. I played some Arena, got frustrated, some Daggerfall, got bored, some Oblivion, game crashed within half an hour, played some Skyrim, spent more time tweaking settings than playing, played some Morrowind and... well, I had a good time. I ended up playing non-stop until I finished the main quest--something I was never able to do when I was younger. I gave myself a pat on the back and moved on to Tribunal.\n\nMorrowind is, in my opinion, the best Elder Scrolls Game -- nay, the best Bethesda game -- I have ever played. Not only is its artwork and story amazing, but the sheer amount of crap, loot, creatures, and NPC personality is astounding. I can honestly say that Morrowind is the only TES game I can say is completely, 100% playable without a single mod. Not even the official add-ons (although those were fun in their own right). As much as I loved Oblivion with the Shivering Isles, and Skyrim with Dawnguard, I have (after countless hours beating them on the console) had a much less enjoyable experience with them unmodded then I have with them modded. The most mods I have ever thought helpful for Morrowind are the Morrowind Code Patch and the Morrowind Patch Project. Most other mods for Morrowind have felt as though they detract from it for me (especially the MGSO, or the Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul. I have never found graphics to define a game, only to help define a game. The only texture pack I have felt fitting for Morrowind is "Morrowind Watercolored", a nice, light-weight texture pack which is similar to the Vanilla), however, I can understand that my tastes are not for everyone, so some people find some Morrowind mods rather enjoyable.\n\nMorrowind Pros:\n+++Great story\n+++Great Vanilla playthrough\n++Great job at minimizing hand-holding\n+Great leveled list and hand-placing items (i.e. makes sense)\n++Great use of game mechanics for skills\n++Players can easily RP for this RPG\n++++++Lots of artifacts, unique items, awesome/funny quests, misc items, easter eggs, the list goes on...\n+UI is rather convenient\n+Decent controls\n\nCons:\n--------Bugs, oh so many broken quests and glitchy issues\n--Non GOTY edition is a lot worse, I'd reccomend getting the GOTY...\n--lack of some (fixable through MCP) VERY helpful keyboard shortcuts\n-A little too much of NPCs saying the exact same thing as everyone else\n-It is a lot more difficult for people to be a mage than a warrior or vice-versa due to the time-consuming nature of switching to spells and back to sword/spear/mace/axe\n------Cliff Racers... them annoying buggers\n\nThings I really like but some people would greatly agree/disagree on:\n~~Interesting combat system, can either be a swing-and-miss session or someone dies in a few hits...\n~~Journal system: I find rather immersive and MUCH improved in the GOTY edition (or simply with Tribunal)\n~~Difficulty: I find the reccomended difficulty to be perfect, with no need to turn it up so I'll start taking damage\n~~It's a bit difficult for new characters, as there is very little leveling of creatures/people/items. However, with the right knowledge, you can use this to your advantage...\n\nAll in all, I'd say Morrowind is a darn fine game.\n\nThanks for reading! Peace!\n\n~PikachunoTM\n\nEdit: I actually have gotten around to modding for Morrowind -- even working on a few mods myself, and find it a real blast to mess around with the Construction Set, editing things left and right, adding new things, and more. There's so much to the game even after I've beaten it several times now, it's still worth re-visiting in my eyes. I hope other people will get as much fun out of it as I have.","July 22, 2015","true","378.5"," 343 of 353 people (97%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","97","343","353","15","29"

Instead, you will create a character with skills all over the place, run around outside Seyda Neen for a bit, then fight a rat with a depleted fatigue bar wielding a weapon you are not skilled in, die miserably and ♥♥♥♥-post on your nearest imageboard with something like "miss miss miss".\n\nIf you, however, are not afraid to figure things out for yourself, explore a vast and dangerous world filled with many secrets that are available to you right from the start with little guidance, and are not put off by reading a fair amount, then you could find a game that is unlike any other you will ever play and may capture you for hundreds of hours.\n\nMorrowind marks a turning point in Bethesdas career, before they figured out that going for the wider audience and console markets, aiming for the lowest common denominator and spending more budget on marketing than development will make more profit than making actually good games. Unfortunately, we will never see another game like Morrowind ever again, let alone a successor. Oblivion and Oblivion 1,5 Skyrim are worse in almost every way, and take away more than they add. One step forward, three steps back if you will. Fortunately, digital goods do not have an expiration date, and old games can still be played and enjoyed years after release.\n\nThe game combines modern graphics with classic functionality. As such, many things will be determined by dice rolls. Many inexperienced players have expressed their frustration when (not) hitting enemies in combat. Let me just say this: it is perfectly possible to create a character who, even at level 1, never misses an evenly matched opponent. Though this is not something a newbie would come up with. Here's a protip: weapon skills and fatigue are important. Like, really important. It is always better to use the rusty iron sword with a high weapon skill over the mace of world destruction with a low weapon skill.\n\nMorrowinds main selling point is the open world, which is available to you once you complete the short tutorial. Unlike later games in the series, where you are the center of the universe and the world revolves around you, in Morrowind you start as a nobody, dropped in a world that would exist with or without you.\nThat underwater cave at the edge of the world will not have exactly the same treasure and enemies as the dungeon just across the tutorial town. The chest at the bottom of the biggest and baddest dungeon will not contain a rusty iron dagger just because you were brave and smart (or stupid) enough to get it early. Poor bandits will not wear armor worth as much as an entire city just because you are high-level. The world is there, and waiting for you to explore it. Here, a young thief won't just have to steal silver spoons and forks because that's all he'll find. All the best gear in the game is available right from the start, although well guarded. And it's whispering to you: "come and get me... if you dare". Also, people are not mysteriously immortal just because you might need to talk to them later. Morrowind lets you do just what you want to do, without trying to protect the player from his/her stupidity through artificial barriers and limitations.\n\nMorrowind doesn't have compass and fast-travel that make you beeline from one objective to another. During your adventures you will inevitably get lost. You were sent to kill someone in a dungeon, and on your way there you find a cave. You clear it, receive skill and gold, and wander off from one interesting thing to another. After a few hours you suddenly remember what you actually came here for. Exploring is half the fun in this game.\n\nBeing on Morrowind is like visiting another planet, with alien, but consistent and credible wildlife and landmarks. The atmosphere and immersion is second to none, and as with any game, the music plays a major part of it. The soundtrack is simply wonderful, which makes it even easier to get absorbed in the game as the hours fly by. There is nothing quite like reading the ironic shortstory of a skillbook you found at the end of a dungeon, with the crackling sound of a nearby bonfire or the whispering of buried souls in the background, while listening to the tranquil music.\n\nYou can overcome the challenges Morrowind puts in your path as a strong warrior, a sneaky thief, a smart mage or any mix thereof. Notable is that all of the playstyles the game offers you work reasonably well, as long as you know how to use them. What's interesting is the spell system. Here, mages aren't simple warriors who shoot fireballs instead of swinging a sword. They have about a hundred spell effects at their disposal and can use custom-made spells to do so much more than simply deal damage to enemies.\n\nAs great as Morrowind is, it does have a few flaws. Most of the quests are simple fetchquests and not very interesting on their own. Given however that not only you'll explore the world as you do these quests, but also the way you rank up in factions, this can be overlooked. Factions will treat you as simple errand boy when you are a nobody, while you get to slay vicious monsters and claim powerful rewards as you become a high-ranked member.\nThe leveling system with its attribute modifiers may also be viewed with criticism. If you are the min-maxer type of player and want to make your character as powerful as he/she can be, you have two options: carefully select specific skills that govern specific attributes as your major and minor skills, write down all your skill-ups and control them through calculated play and careful use of trainers - or just install a mod that automatically enables the highest attribute modifiers upon levelups and gives you the freedom to play the way you want with the skills you desire. Note that if you don't care about maxing all attributes and simply play for fun or RPing purposes, none of this is necessary.\n\nThe world, the music, the lore, the atmosphere, the immersion, the depth, the love to the detail, the hand-placed items and NPCs, the ability to mod and so much more make Morrowind my favourite game of all time. It is as close to perfect as a game can be, and I cannot recommend it enough. The start can be somewhat harsh for people unfamiliar with older games, but I'll guarantee that anyone who's willing to spend the time and effort to get into this game will be more than rewarded for it.\n\nDue to a few technical issues, I highly recommend playing Morrowind using the following modifications:\nMGE XE makes Morrowind work on high resolution and in widescreen (remember to adjust the FoV). Just disable all the other stuff such as distant land and visual filters. Although there are a number of tools that allow you to do this, MGE XE is the least intrusive one, once set up.\nMorrowind Patch Project fixes bugs. Hundreds of them.\nMorrowind Code Patch for a few convenience tweaks such as removing inventory window size limit or toggle sneak mode instead of having to hold down the key.\n\nNone of the above mods alter the content of the game in any way. They're mostly of technical nature to turn an otherwise outdated game into a better experience in this day and age.","January 4","true","476.2"," 406 of 430 people (94%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","94","406","430","31","32"

In Skyrim, you are a natural hero born with dragon blood and the innate ability to speak the language of dragons, and go on to greatness as foretold. In each game, along the way, you are seen as the savior of many guilds, groups, and towns, even if they are in conflict with each other in some way.\n\nIn Morrowind, you are placed in Vvardenfell by order of the Emperor because you match a supposed prophecy. With the Daedric prince Azura's assistance to enact her revenge, you're thrown into the position of fulfilling said prophecy under guidance from the Blades, and by going to the hard work of convincing everyone you really are the prophesied one. You don't know if you really fit the bill, but you'll be damned if everyone else won't believe it.\n\nYou climb your way up the ladder of each guild or ruling house you join, fighting your way to the top each time. It's a long, hard road through many cracked and broken pathways, but you clamber up the pile of corpses you made with One-Clan-Under-Moon-And-Star wrapped around your finger, and an ancient Dwemer hammer in your hand. You reap what you sow.\n\nThis is a sign of how different this game is from its successors and predecessors. A story which questions deification, worship, and prophecy; a world wracked by cataclysmic blight storms and the threat of a mortal-turned-insane-god; gameplay that greatly encourages a close eye to character building and leveling; and a plot which culminates in the death of gods and the destruction of that which deifies mortals. This is why Morrowind is so much different than its peers.\n\nIs the gameplay to everyone's liking? Of course not. Those unexperienced with character building, and those without the patience to take in the world around you, won't find much to enjoy in this game. That's the key word. Patience. It's encouraged, and rewarded in spades. Don't play this game if you started at Oblivion or Skyrim. There's very little chance that you'll find this an enjoyable experience.\n\nFor those with the open mind and the patience, this is an incredibly worthy experience that will suck you in and never let you go. Play this only if you know how to manipulate chance and skill to your favor, and how to make your way through a harsh, unforgiving, and challenging world.\n\nBear in mind that this does not come with the Construction Kit.","November 30, 2014","true","333.5"," 328 of 350 people (94%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","94","328","350","23","3"

A lot less hand-holding as well. Unlike many other newer Bethesda  games, while you can go anywhere, you shouldn't.

Built in the fleeting early 2000s window of opportunity where there was already enough money sloshing around the industry to support a lavish open world first person CRPG but before the pressure of needing it to sell to literally every last person on earth in order to recoup costs and having to water it down accordingly.\nThe first time you swing a knife that thing's gonna slash down, give every indication of colliding with whatever you were trying to hit, and do no damage whatsoever. Because despite looking very much 2002 (the graphics slightly hokey but redeemed by unheard of draw distances and consistently on-point audiovisual design (yes even the faces dammit)) it's running old testament dice rolls under the hood. There are skill trees for shockingly useless weapon types and the game won't lift a finger to stop you from murdering and/or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off essential NPCs, offering only a little dialog box after the fact asking whether you want to reload a save or continue on your doomed quest. It's not a particularly unforgiving game but it asks that you engage it on its own terms and learn the systems in order to succeed instead of waltzing in like an obnoxious tourist on an all-in package trip to the final boss. If you can manage this, you'll find few videogame locales are as immersive (there's this almost Minecraft-ish internal concistency to the way every object and actor works in exactly the same way and a lot of emergent fun to be had exploiting this) and memorable as Morrowind's Vvardenfell.\n\nOh right and then they ported it to the fledgling Xbox where it proceeded to sell a trillion copies and in one of the great tragic misunderstandings of our era instead of going 'hey looks like console gamers have a taste for complex, immersive CRPGs too' Bethesda went 'oh there's money in open world console RPGs? better make Oblivion simple enough for elementary school kids because all console owners are idiots!'\n\n(note: my playtime on the steam version isn't indicative of how long I've actually spent playing as I also own the original CD-ROM release, the Xbox version, the DVD-ROM GOTY PC rerelease plus its Xbox counterpart and I must've logged 300ish hours over the years.)","December 27, 2013","true","94.8"," 179 of 196 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","179","196","0","5"

I have owned Morrowind (and the expansions) since the days they were released (Morrowind was released in 2002). I played Morrowind the most between its release and Oblivion's release. I only recently bought Morrowind on steam a couple months ago (to finally get a digital copy, I still have the CDs), thus the lack of play time on steam. But make no mistake, I have put many, many hours into Morrowind.\n\nField  Rating  Review    Graphics  6.5  Poor Morrowind has not aged well at all. Though not terrible, it is a bit jarring to return to from the beauty that is Skyrim.  However, with the upcoming Skywind project (and currently available texture packs), keep your eyes peeled. Morrowind is well worth exploring, despite being a little tough on the eyes at times.\n(Graphics are not used in the overall score, due to the game's age.)    Gameplay  10  The epitome of an open-world RPG, Morrowind not only pushed the envelope, it lit it on fire and hand-crafted a new one. Classic RPG elements come into play with your skills, leveled up according to you. Quest giver giving you lip? Kill him, take back your items. Short on cash? Steal it from whoever you want, just be prepared to pay the price if you're caught. You cannot go wrong with Morrowind, which captures the magic of another world like no other game out there.    Story  10  A long, arching plot with plenty of diverse character interactions. As you progress, your fame grows, and the world reacts to this. Experience the joy of embracing your destiny to save Morrowind. With countless sidequests and unique zones to explore, and tons of lore to discover, Morrowind has many stories to tell. But most of all, yours.    Multiplayer  N/A  Sadly, this game can only be enjoyed alone.    Replayability  7  Never has any game absorbed more of my time than Morrowind. You'll never play it the same twice. Once Skywind comes out, expect this number to jump plenty high, as Morrowind deserves your time, and will be even more beautiful than it was when it first released.    Overall  9.3/10  Morrowind captured the magic of exploration and gaming for me. I have extremely fond memories of this game, and highly recommend it to anyone, and everyone. Even without the upcoming Skywind mod, Morrowind is a game you should pick up. Do NOT miss out on the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series, and a legend among games.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster\n\nEdit: Reworked scoring so that the age of the game and its graphics weren't damaging the overall rating, as that's not very fair for older games. Also reworded the overall review to focus more on Morrowind instead of Skywind. Fixed some styling. Added note explaining lack of playtime on steam.","October 20, 2014","true","3.1"," 353 of 436 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","353","436","16","27"

All your questions will be answered.\n\nThe Elder’s scroll III: Morrowind is an open world fantasy role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and published by Bethesda Softworks and Ubisoft. Yeah, infamous Ubisoft. Don’t be afraid though. With mods like Morrowind Overhaul, it really comes alive with enjoyable playability. The main story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of Morrowind.\n\nYou need a good pair of eyes with this game. Morrowind isn’t about great graphics. Morrowind isn’t about multiplaying with your homies either. It isn’t about perks, or kill streaks. It’s about love. Yeah, you got it. Love. After you have played Morrowind from start to end, all the way, you know why. All those beautiful Dunmer ladies with tight skirts. Those cat like Khajiit broads with their fancy nails. Orc girls with nice biceps. With a excellent story and races like these, you won’t find any trouble replaying your game, again and again.\n\nI’m a mage lover. I publicly admit it. I love magic. I love the feeling, when I tear apart crowd of bandits with a fireball. I love when I shine like a diamond after buffs. Morrowind has really good variety of spells, and you can make your own spells too. If you are ambitious enough, you can become the leader of Mages guild, which is always nice. They have nice robes.\nYou didn’t find the answers right? You will my friend.\nWant it?

A game where you'll spend countless hours walking through the sprawling foyadas and dreary caves of Vvardenfell. Unlike it's successors, Oblivion and Skyrim, where they bring many of us to worlds that are familiar to us, Morrowind doesn't do that. Instead it brings you to a world unlike any other, the homeland of the Dunmer. From it's lush greens to the west, swampy marshes in the south and east, and deserted and diseased ashlands to the north. The questlines will take you all the way across the massive island, and no doubt will you be spending hours of your time just gazing at the beauty of Morrowind's aesthetics. Granted, it's a game from 2002 and without a doubt the graphics are dated. But with a few mods it will go a long way, and even with Morrowind unmodded, it is still a great game.\n\nAs for controls and gameplay, they are by far the clunkiest out of the TES series, and Oblivion shares this characteristic as well. The combat is 'hit by chance' and can get awfully annoying when you die five times to a mudcrab or a cliff racer. The protagonist walks and especially runs awfully slow at the beginning of the game, even with just clothing. My favorite thing, however, is the spells. Something that Skyrim definitely does not have and Oblivion could've been better with was spells and spell making. In Morrowind there is a MASSIVE plethora of spells you can use to create your very own spells, i.e. a spell I made called the Potato-Motato whereas it not only burns an enemy, but paralyzes and poisons it (Needless to say, it's pretty awesome, name aside.).\n\nAlthough the music is great, the sound effects are... okay. The voice actors seemed to had sounded very bored and that they were just reading their scripts instead of sounding like they're actually their character. The sound effects are pretty much stock sounds you'd find from any game creator program. The stepping noise is awfully annoying and loud, even on lowered volume.\n\nTL;DR It is a great game, and if you are a fan of Oblivion, Skyrim, or both, you NEED to try this game out.","June 23, 2014","true","35.6"," 86 of 89 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","86","89","0","0"

You have more skills, spell types, creature/enemy types, more dungeons/places, more quests and NPC's... Think about Skyrim, then combine it with Oblivion, and you still won't meet the scale of Morrowind. Unfortunately in an un-modded Morrowind, many people, especially those that started their Elder Scrolls experience with Skyrim,  will dislike the combat and graphics. For those of you that can't stand dated graphics, there are many mods that can enhance the graphics to match that of Skyrim. There are also mods that make combat play like it does in Oblivion and Skyrim, allow you to smith items, do every day jobs, etc.\n\nAll in all, Morrowind (with mods in tow) can give you an even greater experience than that of even Skyrim, if only because of the massive amounts of capabilities and options available to you that they removed in the newer games.

Get use to the idea of riding giant fleas everywhere as well.\n\nNow I can sit here and scribe to you of they joys collectiong the three S's. That is skulls, skooma, and (moon) sugar. Or the countless trips to sell  weapons and armor to a mudcrab. The frustration of taking over a shop like Ra'Virrs to enter and find half the items placed gone awry. Fixing your twitch to kill all NPCS in sight as I am sure you did in this great games' successors. The limitless magical artifacts that you will just have stored away. The countless hours of just reading books. I mean seriously read the books, you will read some twisted things. That no eyes will never be able to unsee! Dont forget the pain of clicking every subject when you interact with npcs just to press your luck if you updated any other quests.\n\n\nYet like any RPG known to the world sure you can make this a long game, a short game, you know...what ever stirs the gumbo. There will be some of you who always just play the main story in games. Power hungry to beat them and get over with it. The hours that can be spent in this game are infinite. With over 11 Factions, you will endure a great struggle. This is a true game based on Lore alone! A vast handcrafted world with countless years of perfecting its beauty in concept and unique dungeons.  Sure you can say most of Morrowind is ugly yet this is the time based era through the storyline. A God spreading his blight across the lands.\n\nWith all this being said if you can endure the first bump in the road to Morrowind, the dice based combat rolls ( I mean after all this play style was big in the prior era of its release in the PC gaming industry), and not your modern day graphics. (If the graphics are holding you back from this game, just go play your watered down Oblivion or Skyrim ya big baby) You will have a great time with this game. Just remember to use mark/recall, steal a collection of something, spoons, lamps, your pick. Oh and download the overhaul for this game, your eyes wont be disappointed!\n","January 1, 2014","true","149.9"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","72","76","2","6"

It's sad to see a lot of people be put off from experiencing this game due to things like ♥♥♥ graphics or a less-than stellar combat system. Certainly, the game has it's flaws, but from my perspective it trumps TES IV and V in what it does right. Morrowind is not for the faint of heart who just want to ignore any plot-lines and kill things. The game requires patience and a little bit of creativity to make the most out of it.\n\nBeing a mage sucks at first because learning spells is really expensive and magicka is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to manage in this game. Being an archer sucks at first because landing sneak attacks is finicky and whiffing all of your shots due to low agility or fatigue can be VERY frustrating. Even being a warrior sucks since melee combat can be a bit of a slog and heavy armor sucks in the early game.\n\nBut the important thing to remember in Morrowind is not to focus in one particular area of expertise, but rather try hard to excel in all of them. Quickly switching weapons and being able to cast spells on the fly makes being a diverse character infinitely easier and more enjoyable. A good warrior is bound to keep a bow around as a ranged weapon and know a spell or two to work themselves out of a difficult situation\n\nBut even more interesting than the freedom of character building is the world building of Vvardenfell. The lack of an omnipotent compass and a map that can't warp you around (gasp) make exploring the world to get things done a mandatory step in any player's journey. No spoilers, but the number of things to distract you as you journey across the island are, for the most part, all interesting and only serve to better you as a character and inform you, as the player, of the ever changing world.\n\nTL;DR: This game requires patience, but will lead to a massive payout in story and character growth.","May 24, 2015","true","509.8"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","52","53","3","0"

I was then interested in exploring all of the possible paths that one could follow while playing morrowind. It became my cult-favorite/alltime-favorite game.\n\nThen came along Oblivion which was promised to be morrowind with nice graphics and I played that and hated it. Then DLC came out and I played it again and again and again you get the picture. Soon, I found myself lost in the massive world of tamerial and it became my cult-favorite/second-most-favorite game of all time.\n\nAlong comes the big bad Skyrim and I was prepared. I expected the game to be dumbed down, and I expected it to be the last ES game that would I ever play. Because, I figured that I'd like the story and dlc but it would lose it's replay value in the dumbing down process. I played it and I hated it then the DLC came out and I hated that too. I managed to put a hundred or so hours into it and felt as though it was wasted time. Then came along 200 hours, and I said that was enough, I'm way over powered, and the game is not much fun anymore. Along comes the modding community to save the day, and that is what they did. I became addicted to modding my skyrim and playing a few levels and modding it more till I broke the game, fresh install, rinse and repeat.Then I used the memory patcher and everything just worked and I decieded that I'd play the game one more time to see if I could tolerate it as an ES title. Now, three different characters later I can say that Skyrim has become my cult-favorite/third/second-all-time-favorite game. I enjoy this more now than oblivion, but chronologically it is third :p\n\nNow I've decided to give Morrowind another play-through, right now I'm on the road on my way to balmora and loving it but not for any of the reasons stated above, but because there is a level of nostalgia that is present. I worry that the cliff racers and the terrible combat mechanics will force me to abandon my task.\n\nI WOULD RECOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO INTERESTED IN CHALLENGING THEIR PATIENCE AND THEIR MIND!!","February 12, 2014","true","28.1"," 147 of 197 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","147","197","0","0"

I will always be able to pick it up and play through it again. Why? It's difficult to put into words. But something about Morrowind's universe captivated me from the very first moment I reached the city of Balmora. I really can't explain it. There is a certain ambience that emanates from that particular city. Some people feel it, others don't. Part of me believes that this is the dividing-line between the people that can drop hundreds of hours into Morrowind in the blink of an eye and the people who just can't get into it. Both viewpoints are understandable. The other part of me thinks that maybe I'm reading far too much into a simple video game. Who's to say? The only thing that I can say for sure is that Morrowind is anything but simple.\n\nI've played through this game many, MANY times since it's release and I always stumble across something I've never encountered before. It never fails. Sometimes it's flavor text that helps me piece together a story I didn't fully understand before... occassionally I'll find some unique artifact or item that I had never found previously. There is always something out there, subtle or not, to enrich the experience for me even more. And that's part of what keeps me coming back.\n\nI highly recommend installing MGSO for Morrowind (old and new players alike). It's a compilation of some of the best mods on the market for Morrowind. It essentially gives Morrowind a facelift. I know some of you may not feel like taking the time to figure the modding-aspect of the game, but when it comes to MGSO you have nothing to worry about. It literally installs itself for you.","November 15, 2014","true","208.0"," 66 of 75 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","66","75","6","0"

Sure, you don't have many options for hair or face, and yes, the sluggish walk and dicey combat system can be a bit off-putting.  But past it all, when you've finally gotten to that comfortable place where you can run faster than a slug on a Sunday and hit more times than you'll miss, you begin to appreciate the game as more than just a piece of software.  You really do begin to see it as an adventure into a foreign land.  A place where you've never been before, but will surely uncover its secrets in due time.\n\nAnd thanks to the good people of the Internet, mods have been created that help with issues in game, such as the overall graphics (especially NPC and player models, such as the Better Bodies mod) and whatever else you might consider to be a problem or upgrade-worthy factor.  The fact of the matter is, that when the dust has settled and all is said and done, Morrowind still remains one of the cornerstone RPGs of yesteryear, and I certainly know that it'll forever be one of the defining games for the RPG genre.\n\n9/10, Thank you based Azura","November 8, 2014","true","18.1"," 65 of 74 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","65","74","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunaptra/recommended/22320/","Hunaptra","нμηαρτяα","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunaptra/","94 products in account","(TL;DR - It's a good open world RPG, if you like TES games and haven't played this then get it, get it if it looks good too. Yup.)\n\nWhat to say... Well I could start by saying its possibly my favorite Elder Scrolls game. For those of you not in the know of what the Elder Scrolls series is, let the Spectre tell you it's an RPG series started in March 1994 with The Elder Scrolls I: Arena.\n\nWhat you do in the  game is your choice, whether you want to be an assassin who's good with heavy armor, a straight up tank, or a noble adventuring mage. The goal of the series is to make you feel immersed in another universe, play another life. Now the series started to go downhill and it wasn't looking good for Bethesda. So they put Todd Howard in the lead for the development of Morrowind. Now Todd, he figured if it might be their last game they might as well go out with a bang or try to revive the series (at least thats what I think) and had the team work on Morrowind and put their all into it. Of course this worked tremendously.\n\nNow enough history, lets get back into the review shall we? Hmmm... where was I? Oh yes! I remember now, favorite elder scrolls game blah blah blah no one cares. Now let me tell why this is.\n\nPros:	1. Quests. The game is rich with quests that could take you weeks or more to complete and lots of detail and places that can take you months to see. The amount of NPCs is astonishing (even though the dialog might not always be too interesting or unique), and all of them are individually named with the exception of the respawning guards or creatures, which is awesome and immersive.\n\n2. Openess. The openess is impressive even with todays standards. You can go to any part of the map, whether it's in the ocean, or some mountain, or castle, or whatever, you can go there at any point in the game (though it's easier to do with a levitate potion or spell). You can start a new character and right after you finish the quick character creation/tutorial bit you can go where ever you want! No need for the  main quest when you've got exploring to do!\n\n3. Map. The map size is huge (though not the biggest by any means, it's 16 km2 or 6.17 m2), it will take some time for you to fill your map. You could be walking for an hour thinking you've made a lot of progress, but when you look at your map you see you only discovered a small percentage of the world. Better walk a few more hours huh?\n\n4. Lore. This game has a lot of lore, from abandoned fortresses, to extinct races, to gods, to a guide about the Fishy Stick, and much more. Since this is in the TES series, if there's a part of the lore you can't find any information too, odds are there's something about it on the wikis. It's full of history, and you're also, in a sense, creating some of it by being the reincarnation of the Nerevarine. Wanna learn some of the lore? You can either read one of the many books, talk to NPCs, go questing, stumble on it by accident, or by dicovering and learning it by some other means.	Now I could keep going with this review praising this game but ther really is no point. There are very few cons, but I'll name a couple and they won't be of much significance I can assure you.\n\nCons:	1. Learning curve. Steep learning curve for new players, trust me. It you're transitioning from a game like Skyrim then you're in for a surprise. Welcome to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Prepare to Die Edition! But don't worry, you'll learn sooner or later, just keep practicing and you'll get it.\n\n2. Lack of dialog. You could talk to 20 NPCs with the same things to say. This can get a little boring looking for quests or an overall interesting NPC. It's not really a big deal, it's just a minor thing. Although you can just download the LGNPCs (Less Generic NPCs) mod, though it's still in development.\n(The LGNPC[lgnpc.org] homepage.)\n\n3. View distance. The view distance is terrible. Now I know this game came out in 2002 but the game is made to put the entire view distence rendering on the CPU. Now I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure if most games from that time period do that but I doubt it. Bethesda just didn't optimize it very well. Whatever I guess, it's realistic right? Seriously, who can see more then 50 feet ahead of themselves?\n(Use MGE[sourceforge.net] to increase view distance.)Final\nAnyway, this game is amazing, and I don't know what it is about it but its more open than the newer Elder Scrolls (at least it feels that way to me). While it may be difficult to get into or just difficult, odds are it's going to be that way for a while with new players. But after some hardwork, perserverance, and maybe a little help from the UESP, you will find the game becomes a bit easier and you will be rewarded for your efforts in one way or another. It's filled with lore, easter eggs, and many quests, you won't be discovering everything anytime soon.\n\nI guess that will conlude this "short" review. And to all you new comers, have a Fishy Stick! I know you would like to keep reading this "amazing" review but I gotta go. This is Spectre (or whatever my username is at the time you're reading this )signing off, see ya!\n\n-Kyle (a.k.a.

It may have its glitches and quirks, but that is part of what makes the game what it is: A closed system with a set of given rules that you can ♥♥♥♥ around in to your heart's content, exploiting exploits at the corners of logic, and having a blast. Want to roam the wilderness robbing tombs and shipwrecks? Go ahead. Want to put on a cloak of constant levitation and float about taunting people on the ground? Go ahead. Want to kill a god (or two)? Go ahead. Want to follow the story (you weirdo)? Go ahead.\nSo that covers the sandboxiness of it. The atmosphere is another incredible part- awesome unique environments, incredible music (that Jeremy Soule basically just copied for the next 10 years for sequels), and memorable locales (literally- I can navigate Balmora with my eyes closed).\nSome may consider the graphics to be subpar today (I don't mind them, personally), but there are loads of mods to fix that. Some complain about the click-click-click combat, but again, once you understand the system, just play within it.\nSo yeah, if you haven't played this game, buy it now. Even at $20. NOW. DO IT.

Gone.\nOh, don't you LOVE your dual-wielding, shouts, infinite mana with the right gear, vampires that don't catch on fire on contact with the sun, followers, and anything else that is softcore? GONE.\n\nNow, I'm not saying Skyrim is a bad game, it's actually a great game. It just seems a bit too easy to me. But, luckily, before the generation of games that help you aim, regenerate your health, and let you use a sniper rifle the wrong way but it somehow works, there was these kind of games.\n\nThis game is one of my personal favorites of all time. I really enjoyed this when I was a kid on the original Xbox, so, a couple years ago, I decided to buy it on steam.\n\nIt gives you a brief tutorial, then you're on your own, and it won't hold your hand. Just you, your weapon, your skills, and your unforgiving enemies (not to mention cliff racers... oh god, the cliff racers).\n\nThe story is also great. What's that? You're the dragonborn? How about a cross-Vvardenfell idol that kills gods, vampires, kwama, etc, is the greatest wizard in the history of Tamriel, and can literally levitate and go anywhere? Anyway, the story made me feel like I was a god. I never felt like that in a game in a while.\n\nOverall, I would say this is a must-buy for any challenge-seeker, fan of classic games, elder scrolls fan, or those looking for a great RPG.

This game is very memorable, though, and I would recommend for sure.","December 14, 2014","true","73.5"," 58 of 67 people (87%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","87","58","67","16","0"

You must invest more hours it it before it shines before you in all it's glory.\n\nBattle system is one of the cons of ESIII. For those who are not in the know: battle system is based on a random chance of hitting. The higher your, say, short sword skill is, the higher the chance for your strike to be successful. Not a lot of fun, to say the least.\n\nAnimations are bad, sounds repeat too often but that's about it with downsides.\n\nPros:\n\nAtmosphere. Burnt-out ashlands, giant mushrooms, swamps... The world and lore are one of a kind. Graphics are Ok so it all looks pretty neat.\n\nMusic is epic. I loved almost every second of it.\n\nStory is engaging.\n\nMorrowind is harsh. No fast travel, no markers - just a map and your a.s.s. You have to read a f-n journal in order to understand where to go! That's terrific!\n\nWeapons and armor break and you have to repair them. Essential for RPG's IMHO.\n\nSome creatures cannot be hurt with particular weapons or skills. For instance, you can't hit the spirit with a common sword!!! Hell yeah! Now we're talking!\n\nGame's pretty hard. Anyway, you can adjust difficulty but even on easy your butt can be kicked hard in the wilderness.\n\nAnd about deepness. The world IS really deep. Earlier I thought it's just an illusion but it's not. There are some filler NPC's and generic dungeons but really... There's so much to do here! Sidequests, reading books, crafting potions, kicking creatures' a.s.ses. And main story, of course.\n\nConsidering that the game came out in 2002 (technologies, you know) all downsides can be and ARE forgiven. Must play for every RPG, fantasy and ES fan.","October 21, 2014","true","44.5"," 60 of 75 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","60","75","2","13"

I played Oblivion next, then Morrowind, and I have to say out of those 3 Morrowind is my favorite Elder Scrolls games I have played. It was extremely challenging at first since some areas have very high level monsters and it isnt leveled like it is in Oblivion and Skyrim.\n\nHowever, when you reach higher levels you become a literal god of Morrowind able to fly around, leap far and high distances, cast crazy insane spells. It's a lot of fun packed with tons of content. It is very unforgiving so one thing I learned is to save, and save often!\n\nAlso if you steal something and no one notices prepare for the Dark Brotherhood to come kill you in your sleep.

But I'll not gonna tell you that Morrowind is THE Best of RPGs, or even vouch for it like for the best in Bethesda's TES serial.\n\nIt is not fitting for every person, but quite pervasive for those who caught the flow.\n\nThere are no other game where I restarted from the very beginning so many times not because I've died from some critters, or did something wrong... I restarted this game so many for the boundless field of possibilities of what to do with your character in that game.\n\nMorrowind's game mechanics, would that be fighting, character evolution, story and quests patterns - they all may look quite dated, clumsy and unpolished. But all of those starting to make sense after you discover the biggest hook of the game. Not only it is one of the most glorious open-world adventures, it is also a great sandbox game! The greatest sandbox in whole RPG genre, that's a good definition!\n\nMorrowind giving you all the tools to make your adventure the most unique in the world. The first and the most useful tool for it is the magic. That part is much more sophisticated, then in previous and later Elder Scrolls games, for you have the immense variety of effects you can combine in spells, embed in your inventory, drastically changing not only yourself, but the whole world around you! To kill a demigod, capture his soul and use it to create the most powerful weapon... that could be a full of pathos main quest in some other game, but in Morrowind you can do it on daily basis (until you run off the demigods). And without any pointers from quest system... Or hey, forget the uberweapon, use the soul of god to warming your trousers, you can do that too!\n\nOkay, let's finish that. Morrowind was released in 2002, and vanilla version surely looks quite aged for modern standards... For graphics, for clunky mechanics, for difficulty... But with all that, it is still one of the most cunning worlds ever created. It is still looks great, it is still gives you the same enormous field to play with magic, dozens of heroic quest deeds and much more things you expecting from an open-world game. And if graphics or compatibility bothers you, there are various mods like OpenMW, Morrowind Overhaul 3 and so on, to cherish your eye...\nSo I hope you'll share the delight from this game with me and millions of other fans of that living monument of the game design.\n\nAs of mark... Morrowind does not need my 10, but even with all glitches and hardtimes that I experienced with it for those 14 years... It is worth not less than 9/10.

So I hope you'll share the delight from this game with me and millions of other fans of that living monument of the game design.\n\nMorrowind marks a turning point in Bethesda’s career, before they figured out that going for the wider audience and console markets, aiming for the lowest common denominator and spending more budget on marketing than development will make more profit than making actually good games. Unfortunately, we will never see another game like Morrowind ever again, let alone a successor. Oblivion and Skyrim are worse in almost every way, and take away more than they add. One step forward, three steps back if you will. Fortunately, digital goods do not have an expiration date, and old games can still be played and enjoyed years after release.\n\nThe game combines modern graphics with classic functionality. As such, many things will be determined by dice rolls. Many inexperienced players have expressed their frustration when not hitting enemies in combat. Let me just say this, it is perfectly possible to create a character who, even at level one, never misses an evenly matched opponent. Though this is not something a newbie would come up with.\n\nMorrowind’s main selling point is the open world, which is available to you once you complete the short tutorial. Unlike later games in the series, where you are the center of the universe and the world revolves around you, in Morrowind you start as a nobody, dropped in a world that would exist with or without you.\n\nUnlike the later games in the series, that underwater cave at the edge of the world will not have exactly the same treasure and enemies as the dungeon just across the tutorial town. The chest at the bottom of the biggest and most dangerous dungeon will not contain a rusty iron dagger just because you were at too low of a level. Poor bandits will not wear armor worth as much as an entire city just because you are high-level. The world is there, and waiting for you to explore it. Here, a young thief won't just have to steal silver spoons and forks because that's all he will find. All the best gear in the game is available right from the start, although well-guarded.  Also, people are not mysteriously immortal just because you might need to talk to them later. Morrowind lets you do just what you want to do, without trying to protect the player from his/her stupidity through artificial barriers and limitations.","June 6, 2015","true","377.4"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","30","34","3","0"

Well ♥♥♥♥ you, there's a very simple mod for that, just google Morrowind Overhaul. It's an all-in-one patch that updates the graphics/sound and adds several atmospheric mods, as well as many additional options. No ♥♥♥♥ing with anything in your files either, it all installs in one simple install wizard.\n\nNo ♥♥♥♥ing excuses now, go play it, get your ♥♥♥♥ blown away at what a good TES game would look like and thank me later you god damn n'wah.","June 25, 2015","true","42.5"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","78","39","50","19","0"

Worth playing at least once. It's weakest aspect which is the combat isn't that much of a drawback and it's pretty fun early one when you are a weakling and pretty much anything can kill you if careless so... there is that.\n\nWhat I most enjoyed was the exploration aspect of the game. Morrowind is an interesting place just to explore and see what you can find, both good and bad. The in game story and lore aren't half bad either and in comparison to the later ES games seem positively Tolkeish. A lot of fun to be had messing around with the potions and developing all kinds of cool abilities like flight or super jumps.

First of all it is much more of a hardcore RPG than skyrim and Oblivion, you will need lots of trial and error with what to do when it comes to what the right things to say to people are, where to go and how you should build your character.  There are so many quests to do in cities like Vivec that they will keep you busy for plenty of hours, and all the things to do outside like exploring caves or maybe venturing up north to explore the dangerous island of Soltheim.  Like I said earlier about it being way more hardcore, you will have to walk everywhere on foot with the acception of paying gold to people to get to major cities.  Also there are no quest markers so you will have to look at your journal for directions and go around asking people for more detailed directions.  The dialouge in this game even though not all your conversations are fully voiced, they are so detailed and emersive you will read it for 10 minutes straight because it's so intresting.\n\nThough you will need to spend lots of time to do quests and to get around in general, I find it to be much more realistic this way and it makes you feel like you're an actual adventurer in the province of Morrowind.\n\n9.7/10","August 10, 2015","true","32.9"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

I put hundreds of hours into it on the retail version, and even so, each playthrough I came across something I missed the first time - And I only ever managed to finish 2 or 3 factions out of the almost a dozen in the game. There is no explaining how deep the game and the story is and how much there is to explore. It made me immerse myself in the story so much and made me want to learn about the lore of the fictional universe like no other game has done to me before, and until now.\n\nThe game is far from easy, and not your casual gaming experience. I even feel compelled to say that you don't play this game for fun and relaxation, but to feel like you've achieved something. It had everything that could be asked from an rpg, but you had to work for it - it was a real challenge. Especially in the beginning you often find yourself close to rage quitting by how this game kicks your ♥♥♥ and makes you work to actually get good at something (best example: combat).\n\nThe game felt more realistic to me. There isn't much communication between NPCs like in Oblivion, and most NPCs shared the same dialogue about specific subjects, but it was still made clear how you, the player, impacted the world - that is by how the NPCs acted towards you, they would like or hate you based on your actions in the world.\nThe guilds are one of the things I love the most in the game, you progress in ranks over time after doing certain errands for the guild, all getting progressively more difficult. By progressing in the world and the factions you earn reputation, which each NPC will pay attention to. You also have differing reputation between the different guilds, meaning that you are hated by some if you are friends with the other, like the strife between the mages guild and house telvanni, or the temple and the imperial legion. But ultimately, you start off as a nobody and are treated as such, and if you do good deeds, you are rewarded and actually recognized for it in the end.\n\nThe quests are more fun to execute because there is no map marker to your destination. Instead, you open your journal and follow directions from there. You can even ask NPCs for hints to your current quest (ask about an item, a location or a person), and they will tell you what they know. This way, you actually work on the task and do some exploring instead of just following the marker on the compass straight to a destination, which your character logically shouldn't have any idea about because they've never been there before.\nIt's a widespread "myth" that Morrowind has no fast travel - that's not true. There is fast travel, only it's not as simple as clicking on a destination on your map and teleporting to it. There are other options, like going by silt strider (mounted), by boat, being teleported by the mages guild and using the spells mark and recall. This limited but more logical fast travelling allows some roleplay and imagination, and more importantly it further fuels the need to explore the world.\n\nMorrowind is, from my point of view, the richest game of the series. By that I mean that it had a lot of expansive and varied ingame features, more than any of the other games, and a lot of the features this game had were removed in Oblivion and Skyrim (I mostly compare Morrowind to the last 2 TES games, because Morrowind is the start of the 'new era' of The Elder Scrolls, starting with the fact that it's 3D). Some of these made it to Oblivion but were removed in Skyrim, but most of these features were removed in both games. To name a few off the top of my head:\nMuch more Skills, Classes, Spellmaking, HUGE weapon variety (look up any Morrowind weapon by material on the uesp wiki, for example daedric, and compare that to the weapon variety of Oblivion or Skyrim), a bigger armor and clothing variety, armor and clothes mixing (e.g. robe on top of armour or 2 different independent pauldrons), more complex enchanting and alchemy, more unique mobs (especially daedra), an actually useful journal with in-depth direction giving, more abilities and spells, non-repetitive, rewarding dungeons and quests, realistic guilds with lots of quests instead of just a single questline for each guild, reputation and character recognition, better immersive races (argonians and khajiit were more beastlike, and all races had according heights and face/body features, in Oblivion and Skyrim all look very similiar and humanoid), freedom of will (no essential NPCs and no linear storyline - you could just decide to kill everyone and doom the world without any restriction, only a warning), and many other little things like easter eggs, which there was a ton of - Bethesda usually likes adding hidden secrets in their games and I can recall a lot in this game.\nThere were also a lot of unique items, armor and weapons. To me it seems like in the later games, the daedric artifacts are almost the only unique items there are. Of course there are some unique artifacts, but not nearly as much as in Morrowind. Unlike Oblivion, Skyrim and the Fallout games, where I had no desire to delve into the generic dungeons unless it was needed for a quest, in Morrowind I always went into similiarly generic caves and tombs the moment I discovered them, just because I knew from experience that there might be an awesome unique artifact inside, which was indeed very often the case.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why I still prefer Morrowind over its successors. When I first started playing Morrowind a few years ago, only after I played Oblivion and Skyrim, I didn't mind the outdated graphics because I was so enthralled by the more prevalent factors of the game, like the story, but coming back to it now the graphics slightly bother me. Which is not a problem, because Morrowind has had an awesome modding community for over 10 years and still even now; there are plenty of visual mods to keep the game fresh and up to date.\nSo if you are ready for a challenge and a one-of-a-kind roleplaying game experience with a very unique setting and an in-depth story that will completely suck you in, you have nothing to lose, even a decade later, because Morrowind will always remain a masterpiece.","May 16","true","165.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiagozak/recommended/22320/","Tiagozak","Tiagozak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiagozak/","466 products in account","Firstly, don't let the Steam statistics fool you: I have played hundreds of hours before having the game on Steam. The time for me to write a review of my favourite game ever has come, and I couldn't be happier. It was the year 1996, and the fairly young videogames studio of Bethesda was releasing The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, the successor of the modest, quite unnoticed first chapter, TES Arena. Presenting you to a world with deep RPG mechanics, a map of the size of Great Britain and the freedom to do whatever you wanted in a sandbox, 3D world, it has become a true legend among the other RPGs of the time. Changing the paradigm, it introduced dozens of brand new mechanics and improved anothers from Arena, making it the turning point for RPGs. Straight after the release of Daggerfall, Bethesda worked on an expansion called Battlespire, that was later turned into a standalone game, and Redguard, a more action-like, dumbed down game that explored the universe and developed the lore. Meanwhile, deep into the studios of Bethesda, more shocking, jawbreaking ideas for a new game started to appear. Making a full, huge 3D detailed world filled with creatures, NPCs, enemies and with a full day/night circle seemed like an utopia, and it actually was. Being developed allways at the edge of the time's hardware, a new TES started to get shape, something bold, something unique, something terrifying and creative. Thus, TES III: Morrowind was born.\nWell, enough with the story. This review will be divided into 4 aspects, graphics, story/plot, gameplay and sound, and a consideration of som other aspects. Released in 2002, as mentioned, Morrowind had two additional expansions, Bloodmoon and Tribunal. Since this in the review of the GOTY Edition, it will also take into consideration all the expansions and official add-ons.\n\nGraphics: this game runs in the Gamebryo Engine, the same engine that was used to make the next TES, Oblivion, and Fallout 3 and New Vegas, so it's an engine that spaned a very long lifetime. In 2002, the minimum requirements for this game were huge, and a state-of-the-art computer was necessary in order to run it in it's ful splendor. While some would think this was a bad optimization, in this case it's just the ludicrous ammount of details and material that was put into this game. The view distance was very short, even with the settings on the maximum, just to make the game able to run in that time's hardware. Nowadays, we can unlock those restrictions and see Morrowind in it's full splendor: for that time, it was just fantastic. From the water to the sky, going through the unique flora and the weird and suffering environment of volcanic formations, strange swamps and some environments that can't even be described due to their singularity make this one of the most inimaginable experiences in gaming. 96 out of 100.\n\nGameplay: most people had their first contact with the TES series with the latest entry, TES V: Skyrim. Skyrim was good, but it was a game made to appeal to the casual masses, which it did. Some may also had their first contact with TES IV: Oblivion, which is, by far, the most equilibrated: the almost perfect balance between deep RPG, TES-like funcionalities, and accessibility for a smoother, more friendly experience. Yet, there is a more restrict group of gamers that had their first contact with Morrowind, or even with the oldest entries. These fans usually see the quality of the latest entries, but miss the deepness Morrowind had. the funcionalities Morowind had made it possible to do whatever you want: you want to be a vampire? You can! You want to be a werewolf? You can! you want to be a mercenary-like warrior working for a guild who gives you nasty jobs? You can! Of course all of that can be done in the other TES as well. the difference resides that in here you must have the appropriate skils to be able to do that and to even be able to accept various quests. This is just an example of the hardness Morrowind presents; From having to constantly sleep to recover health, to be unable to cast a spell properly, to the multiple hits you have to give and take in order to take down an adversary are, the confusion and sense of dispair is always present, making certain actions very rewardful. The only major problem are the menus, the combat system and the dialogue system: while they do their job, they are clumsy and could had been improved a lot. From the useless third person view to the very confusive journal and quest tracking, the interface and the combat is probably Morrowind's biggest flaw. And bugs, lots of bugs. Not as much as Oblivion and Skyrim, but yet, they started all here. 82 out of 100\n\nStory-plot: you, as usual, start as a prisioner. This time, you were released under the order of the Emperor himself, and were dropped in the forsaken island of Vvardenfell, which is a island that comprehends about half of Morrowind's total area, and the home of the Red Mountain, a volano that hosts a mad god-like man inside called Dagoth-Ur. After your release, you do some research jobs for Caius Cosades, a Blade that answers directly to the Emperor. After that apparently uninteresting research you were doing, Caius tells you a very disturbing truth that leads you to a seires of dangerous situations, in order to prove yourself as the Nerevarine, a hero who would save Morrowind from the wrath of the Red Mountain and Dagoth Ur himself. While this is just the main quest, there are still other multiple quest-lines and lots of sidequests that are very interesting and immersive. You can pretty much obtain a huge ammount of lore from the conversations, where you can select multiple topics. The quest-lines on the expansions are also unique and interesting: in bloodmoon, you go to the damned island of Solshteim (the same as in Skyrim's DLC Dragonborn) and involve yourself in a werewolf-related situation. Tribunal starts as a attemp from the Dark Brotherhood to murder you, and leads you to the mainland capital of Morrowind, Mournhold. Here, you will mess with the gods. Without any negative aspect, the plot, and all the TES lore is one of the best ever made for an RPG of this kind. It only sins for the bad organization of the journal, as mentioned above, and could use some more cutscenes or bold scenes. Yet, it's wonderful in it's own way. 95 out of 100.\n\nSound: this is probably one of the most epic sountracks ever written for a game. May the Dunmer Gods bless the soul of Jeremy Soule for his geniousness. Also, it's filled with details: if you are not a Dunmer, Morrowind's native race of elves, you will be called some nasty and pejorative names by the people, allways depending on your race: a Orc will be called an Outlander with a very strong negative conotation, while a imperial will be seen as a "civilized" person. There are just some bugs, like the footsteps that are annoying and faulty, and the repetitive sound of "interacting with objects". 97 out of 100.\n\nOther aspects: with a humongous longetivity, to the ammount of mods the community has made, this game can give you months of fun. The Construction Kit allows you to create your own mods in a fairly easy way (though you may need some geometry knowledge), and it has a very active community even in today's time. As usual, the final score is given by the average between the 4 forementioned aspects, plus a factor of correction based on thre other aspects. So, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, my favourite game ever, and the game that brought to me the world of RPGs end up with the great score of 96 out of 100. Greatest RPG of all time, in my opinion.\n","July 11, 2014","true","4.0"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","1"

I can remember the first time I heard about it. Toonami, on the Cartoon Network, ran a review for Morrowind when it came out. I just remember the open world, do anything you want, mechanic appealing so much to me. I was twelve then, and had not really ever played an RPG, other than Pokemon. I had no idea what to expect. When my cousin rented the game for his original Xbox, we played it all night long. I knew this was a game that would stick with me. And it has. I have come back to this game over and over again about once ever two to three years. When Skyrim came out and I finished it, most of my friends started it over so they could play a different character. But I went back to Morrowind.\n\nWhere to start Hm, well first of all, let me preface my praise for this game with a warning. A lot of modern gamers seem to have difficulty getting into these older classics. The RPG system is fairly old school. Your skill determines your chance to hit and not your damage dealt like in Oblivion and Skyrim. Some modern gamers don't like this restriction, but being a fan of the traditional RPG systems of games like FO1 and FO2, Baldur's Gate, Planescape, etc. I enjoy this system. Sure, it's hard as Hell when you first start out. You feel so incredibly weak. You're in this strange, alien world where nothing is really familiar. Instead of horses or carriages, people ride around in the hollowed out carapace of giant bugs. The abundance of plant life is generally nothing you'll recognize except for a few flowers in the more westernized cities. You really get the sense that you're alone in this wild place. You're so weak that you struggle to battle against rats and mudcrabs. Just make sure you check the "Always Use Best Attack" option in the settings menu. It helps a good deal.\n\nYou also have to really play into the RPG system. This isn't Skyrim where you, a mage, can use any weapon and still be a bad ♥♥♥. If you're a mage, then you won't be able to kill ♥♥♥♥ with a sword. Likewise, if you're a warrior, you're more likely to turn your genitals into a basket of fruit than you are to fry your enemies with magic. Try to choose a race that complements a certain class. Plan out what type of character you're going to play and then try to make your gameplay efficient in that regard.\n\nOne last thing is that this game was created before voice acting was considered necessary in video games. I still argue that voice acting isn't necessary and that I'd rather see more content than less content with voice acting included. Regardless, some people find it difficult to deal without it. Really, it's not that hard to read and it just gets you into the story even more. I find myself paying more attention to the details when I'm reading as opposed to listening.\n\nAnother warning is that the graphics are outdated. When Morrowind was released, it was the pinnacle of video game graphics. Screenshots of the game were advertised on the back of high end graphics cards you'd find in electronic shops. However, thanks to the game's wonderful compatibility with mods, this can totally overhauled with some excellent mods. It's possible to transform the game into something truly more beautiful than it was ever imagined to be.\n\nControls are going to be a problem for you if you only like using a controller. I guess it would be possible to map the controls to an Xbox controller, but it wouldn't really be efficient. I imagine you'd have a lot of difficulty aiming at anything in the midst of battle. It's just as well, though, as this game is better played with a macro keyboard and mouse.\n\nOkay, now that the warning are out of the way, time for the good stuff.\n\nThe writing for this game's story is phenomenal. The backstory and lore for this game is top notch. The atmosphere of the entire game is spot on. You get SO immersed into this world, so quickly. Some crazy things happen to your character in the main story that really just draws you in to the history of this world. The culture of the people in Morrowind is one of the most dynamic and interesting that I've ever seen in video game. The Dunmer culture was solidified in this game and it has obviously left an indelible mark on the series, even on into the future games like Skyrim.\n\nSpeaking of which, the second expansion pack for this game (being including in this GotY bundle) is the first appearance of Solstheim. That's right, the frozen island featured in the Dragonborn DLC for Skyrim is a revisit to the beautiful little island featured in The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon. Bloodmoon allows you to become a werewolf, truly one of the greatest mechanics of the series and something that was sorely missed in Oblivion.\n\nThe other expansion, Tribunal doesn't add any new landmasses, but the capital city of Morrowind, Mournhold. While the city proper isn't huge, the underground sewers, and old ruins are quite expansive. The quests and story for Tribunal is just as compelling as the main quest for Morrowind and gives you the opportunity to meet yet another living god (the first being introduced to you in Morrowind's main quest).\n\nThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is just one of those games that everybody should have in their library. It's just a beautiful game in it's entirety. It does have it's flaws and bugs, but when you take an abstract look at the entire game, it is not hard at all to see why so many people consider it to be a true masterpiece. The story, setting, detail, art, and dialogue is just all so wonderful that outweighs any of it's more "dated" aspects. This game has been with me for around twelve years now and I will probably never stop playing it. There will always be times when I revisit Morrowind, as the little island of Vvardenfell was practically my backyard for my early to mid teenage years. Buy it. It is so worth it. And even if you can't get past the graphics or the lack of voice acting, then buy it anyway and get Oblivion. If you own both of these games, you can run the Morroblivion mod and play all of Morrowind's story in the Oblivion engine. The same will be true for Skywind when that mod is finished. Neither of them have voice acting yet, but the fans are trying to record it. One day, all of Morrowind will be available, fully voiced and retouched in the Oblivion and Skyrim engines.\n\nBut you should experience the game in it's original engine at least once. The feel of it just adds to the magic that is Morrowind.\n\n10/10","July 10, 2014","true","958.8"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","3"

A pinnacle of ''freedom of choice''. The game has no set path or quest marks, it trusts you to be smart enough to figure it out yourself. An open world RPG in the way it was meant to be, simple but hard and effectively smart. The humor is always apparent and you even love the racist dark elves. To me it is the game to come back to when i dont know what to play and i always lose myself in it all over again. Ive finished it so many times and even though the combat feels dated, the modding community keeps it alive. No wonder they are still modding to a scale where they want to recreate it in the Skyrim engine, a multiplayer is still in the making and all of that for a game that is well over 10 years old. To me it is the perfected RPG before they became too easy. Thank god for not fast traveling, no regenerating health and for the love of god there is spellmaking to even deepen the endless possibilities. To me it is my nr.1 game of all time. Nuff Said, just buy, download, mod and enjoy for even a modded version doesnt look so dated.\n\n\n10/10 A Masterpiece amongst masterpieces","January 20","true","59.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","2"

I've been playing this game for many years, and I got the steam version at a later date. My hours would probably be triple what it shows on steam. No quest markers and limited fast travel may sound like a negative to some, but honestly it makes the game so much deeper. You have to talk to everybody, explore dialogue options, and make sure you pay attention to what NPC's say. When they tell you to go east and take a left at the sign post, they mean it. No arrow on the map is going to show you where to go. You have to use your brain. You cant just fast travel anywhere either. You must pay for trasportation, and only at other settlements. You can pay for a ship to take you to Sadrith Mora, for example, but dont expect to be able to warp to every little place you discover. Honestly, it feels more like an adventure this way. You must use your brain and explore your surroundings, like you would in the real world.","June 13, 2015","true","193.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

But then  i decided that 30min-1 hr without really trying to learn how the stats system works wasnt enough. So i gave it another go with a clear mind and as of now i am totally hooked.\n\nthe first thing people will ask how does it compare to skyrim and i say its better.  I have 450 + hrs on skyrim on ps3. And despite me playing this for less i still think this game is better and no this isnt a comparion between this and skyrim.\n\nThe good:\nStory: I will begin with the story and is one of the best stories in an open-world game. One of the best main stories i have seen in a open world  game second only to witcher 3 , but this game has a far better lore. The story touches upon drugs, gods, religion, racism , good and evil is always not as clear as it seems. As someone pointed out who is good guys here are you the good guy or are you helping some evil killing off the good , well that up  to you to decide , but in this game it isnt clear who the villain really is.\n\nQuests:  In this game compared to many games i have played i really feel like doing all the side quests, i feel i help the world in someway, makes it a better place. There are alot of different side quests, from assasination, fetching, clearing a tomb, steal something , persuade etc. The main quest is great and the side quests doesnt feel forced and you will probably on numerous times find out that you rather do the side quests then the main quests. Or like what happens to me alot i do a main quest then suddently i get to a new area were i get tons of new side quests, or some of the side quests i have that can be completed in the area or close to it. Some of the best quests i have seen in a long time. As i said previously only Witcher 3 comes close or surpass it.\n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere is fantastic. Every city feels unique, almost every place feels unique. The landscape/ world is huge and you really feel like you are there , also because of the music. When it comes to the places you visit you got the huge place called Vivec , small towns like Balamora and Peligrad, different forts, a huge mushroom that alot of shops and homes is in.\n\nYou can walk from a huge town then you suddently finda a field with steam or  you have come to a volcano. And the weather system needs to be mentioned too. It can go from bright daylight - to ash storms - to rainy nights.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack is fantastic and really helps creating this fantastic world.\n\nGameplay: Well lets starts with when you hit someone it use a dice based system and a variety of factors and it works. It will probably get smashed by today standards if developers did this in todays games, but if you get around the idea you will find a gameplay that is pretty great and still works al right today.\n\nThe skill system is great, with major, minor and misc skills. Major and Minor skills levels up your overall level so you can have more strenght, luck , agilit etc Misc skills is just some skills that still will help you dont focus on them too much. Your skills depnds on the class.\n\nI will also like to add that the use journal and talk to the people to find the directions to a town or do a quest without any hand holding is great.\n\nYou can enchant whatever you want with say  levitate, that makes you levitate as long as you want. You can make for some stupid reason that when you hit and enemy he will turn inviniclbe. You can enchant so you have more strength etc.\n\nThe fast traveling in this game is pretty great, instead of what alot of todays game do that you simply click on a location you have visit previously and teleporting there for a magical reason you will in this game have to either use a mage guild, slit strider, use scrolls, boat or a  mark and spot with a spell then teleport you to that spot again later.So yeah its old school but adds to the exploration.\n\nCons:\nAs of my update as i have played tribunal and after reaching around 65+ hrs, i have encountered a lot more time falling trough the floor, inside buildings and so on, at the worst time i am stuck and have to teleport out. And yes you get some atletic or acrobatic xp but is still really tire some.\nI have also encountred a few crashes.\n\nScore is redone.\nSo for me i rate this a 9.8/10\nSkyrim if you wonder 9.4/10\n\nOne of the best open world game i have played.  Only witcher 3 , and fallout 2 comes close or even supass it.\n\nN.B: When i wrote my fallout 2 review or the one for deus ex i had hard time imagining that i would fine a new game that  i would enjoy this much on pc and this one did ( not going to be surprised if days of the tentacle, total war rome will be up there too,maybe the old gta`s too). Despite whatever flaws people find in this game i will still say is a masterpiece of a game.\n\nReview might be updated or rewritten when i am done with tribunal and bloodmoon.\nI have rewritten cons and the last paragraph of the gameplay.","April 11","true","93.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","5"

I remember how my mind kind of melted of the very idea of a open world, where you could walk around and do whatever you pleased. Most gamers can relate to those specific games that did not only changed our perspective toward games but maybe even played a part in forming your very personality. I have been a big fan of The Elder Scrolls since then, and Morrowind stays the favorite because of the nostalgia. The game itself is probably not Better than Oblivion or Skyrim, but for me that does not matter.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls have really climbed since Arena, which was not a particularly good game compared to other old-school RPGs from the same age. Daggerfall was certainly an interesting game, with that HUGE world, but sadly randomly generated. Morrowind took a huge step from Daggerfall, going from 2D to 3D and I believe this is where the series really started its "golden age". When Oblivion was about to get released I purchased my first computer and built it just for that game thanks to the impact Morrowind had on me.\n\nAs to be expected, Morrowind is a western fantasy RPG, and today The Elder Scrolls are the biggest western fantasy RPG series. The very idea of the genre is that you choose your own path, build your own character and create your own adventure. Often build around the Health, Mana and Stamina system, where you have these 3... "elements" to preform your attacks and movements. Depending on the class you choose and build, you focus on a specific one of these "elements" for your favor. A mage for example should prioritize to build up mana for his/hers spellcasting while the warrior focuses health for close combat. Morrowind is a very open RPG, very much old-school, where you literally can focus on anything and still make it through the game, something that has been restricted in modern RPGs, where its expected of you to choose less "crazy" builds.\n\nMorrowind is set on the island Vvardenfell in the province of Morrowind in the world known as Tamriel. A very harsh land with the Red Mountain, a volcano, in the middle shaping a very alien and hostile world. Each time I return to this game I feel unfamiliar every time, it is clear that the developers had this in mind for the world to appear strange and unique. It appears Bethesda are very fond of putting your character in imprisonment at the start of all of their games. I like the idea of rising up from the lowest of the low to become the hero, saviour and an ultimate killing machine. In Morrowind you are to become the Nerevar, the upriser of the Dunmer people and defender of Morrowind.\n\nI can not begin to express my love for this game, and I realize that newer players will find the game very clunky and hard in the beginning. The lack of support for higher resolutions and the overall outdated graphics will surely prevent this game to shine at this age. Even so, I feel that this game have so much backstory, and the gameplay will become very rewarding over time. Besides, there are thousands of mods for it these days, such as complete overhauls to make the game very up to standards.\n\nIf you enjoy RPGs, especially western fantasy and The Elder Scrolls, then you should not hesitate to play Morrowind. You just have to get over it being old.","December 3, 2012","true","167.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","3"

There is simply put no other way to describe it in one word. The original Morrowind was my favorite Action Role Playing Game of all time so this upgrade ranks even higher on my list. The Morrowind legacy Grows.\n\nGameplay - This is where The original Morrwind really shines, and Game of the Year edition improves on an already great formula. When you first begin the game you get to start by choosing one of ten races which include everything from the traditional humans, orcs and elves, to the more fantasy like races of the cat like Kajiit people, and the lizard like Argonians. From there you proceed to totally customize everything about your character, including looks, class birth sign, and much more. Each different class and attribute, has a large effect on the game, so playing as an elf mage is completely different than playing as an elf thief, or assassin. The birth signs also come with their own special powers, and weakness's as well so each one is worth trying at least once.\n\nWhen you're finally into the game things start off a bit slow. You run a couple of errands, collect a few stray items as the game walks you through the first little bit, but you soon realize that there is a freedom here that no other game has managed to get just right. Want that piece of armor you see lying there on someone's shelf? Grab it. Want that cool looking sword you see a guard carrying kill him and take it, but be prepared for consequences.\nBethesda went to such great detail on this aspect, that almost every item in the game can be interacted with with great freedom. You can spend hours at a time simply decorating a house you've made your home base, and all items aren't simply decoration. Books are fully readable, herbs can be mixed into potions, crates, bags, and shelves can all be used for storage. Beds can be slept in, candles and lanterns can be placed in your home to light it, or carried along to light dark areas.\nAs far as character development, it's extraordinary, and a bit overwhelming at the same time. Every single action you take has the possibility of increasing one or more skills. Even something so simple as walking or swimming will lead to a faster stronger character in the end. There are nearly limitless combinations in ways to grow your character, so long as you remember every thing you do affects you in some way.\nFighting at first is a bit difficult until you increase in some skills a bit, but with practice you will soon be swinging axes, and casting spells with the best.\nThere is also an option for a third person view if the first person is not your thing, but keep in mind that fighting is a bit more difficult like this because aiming becomes harder.\n\nStory- The story in Morrowind was great, in the game of the Year it simply gets better with two completely new areas to explore, the addition of the Werewolf, and lots more surprises that I won't speak of here. Needless to say it the Story in Game of the Year is greatly improved.\n\nGraphics/Sound - My only real complaint about the first Morrowind was the choppiness in the frame rate, and the awkward way in which it made characters move. Thankfully this has been greatly improved. Characters, and NPCs have a much more fluid look, and less robot-like appearance now. Another improvement is that there is much less fog now. Before it was used to cover pop-in, but now for the most part it is used to convey mood rather than cover up for the programmers.\nThe sound and music are both fantastic. Each race has unique grunts groans, and dialect, they also speak with accents that seem proper for their race. The music has always been a favorite of mine in morrowind, and Game of the Year is no exception. It has that special way of making you feel as though you are really part of something special.\n\nPlay Time/Replayability -This is really a harder one to judge. The play time simply put is as long as you want it to be. As far as a straight walkthrough you could spend anywhere from fifty hours to one hundred plus hours, depending on how many side quest you choose to do, and the rate at which you choose to develop your character.\nReplayability is without a doubt one of Game of the Years best features. As stated earlier each of the Races are completely unique, with there own strengths and weaknesses, add to that all the different classes, the birth signs, literally thousands of different combinations of ways to get through the game, and you have a mighty big game. That's not even mentioning the completely new quest that were added in the expansion.\n\nFinal Recommendation -In conclusion I full-heartedly recommend anyone that has a PC, and even the slightest love of Role Playing Games pick Up this game. It will keep you immersed in it's world for no doubt hours at the time, and at only thirty bucks, you get a lot of added content over the original. I say that Morrowinds world is completely magic, and that's what games are supposed to be.","March 3, 2014","true","3.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","1"

Did you enjoy the hell out of it? This game may be too old school for you, purchase at your own risk. Did you play this before you played oblivion or Skyrim? What are you reading reviews for!? You should either have the game already or be buying it right now!\n\nTo summarize what I love about this game\n- The setting\n- Navigation\n- Interesting quests and events\n- Ability to become insanely OP\n- Enemies that don't scale to your level\n\nThe island of Vvardenfell remains my favourite landscape. Sure the graphics are dated. But, I still recall my astonishment as I exited the boat for the first time. The alien creatures, silt striders, Kwama, nix hounds and those damned cliff racers. The giant mushrooms, sandstorms and blizzards set the environment apart from other sandbox settings. Subtle animations such as your character shielding their face from the sand being tossed about in the storm bring the world to life.\n\nQuesting in this game is quite different from modern rpg and sandbox games. No quest markers exist, at all. Your source of directions are the locals and those you provide you with the quests. Luckily your journal will log all conversations related to quests and topics. Need to remember how to get to Balmora? Open your journal and search under B, any important conversations about the place will be recalled for you to reread.\n\nI don't want to spoil the magic of this event just in case someone reads this, decides to purchase the game and is yet to experience it. But it is just north of Seyda Neen, along the path through the swamp. As another example, further of the track near Seyda Neen, the body of an Imperial tax collector can be found. Still with all his money. What do you do? that is your choice. Tell the guards? Keep the money for yourself? Track down the murderer? No quest markers means that the quest ends when you want it to (to a degree). Of course the true ending of this quest is to track down the murderer, but there is nothing to stop you from just looting the corpse and forgetting about the whole incident.\n\nI'll sum this point up quickly. Scrolls of Icarian Flight Fortify your acrobatics by 1,000 points, making your jump send you flying into the clouds. Without a levitate or slowfall spell the landing will kill you. These are a joke item. But you get the picture.\n\nFinally, the leveling in this game. This is not like modern elder scrolls games. In both Oblivion and Skyrim enemies would scale to your level. However, in Morrowind this does not occur. Early days exploring are best spent cautiously, some enemies will one hit you, should you get too comfortable exploring a Dwemer ruin.\n\nI should also mention combat. This could be a turn off for some. The best way to explain it is that everything is determined by die rolls. Trying to hack at a creature with your sword? What is your skill with a blade? Do you have enough stamina for the swing? What is the targets dexterity? This is all taken into account as you try to hit a target. So some of your attacks will appear to pass through the enemy, missing for no reason.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yes, Absolutely. This game is a must buy (in my opinion) for any fan of rpgs. I'd like to think that anyone who's a fan of the elder scrolls series has played this game. I fear many may call it dated, and give the game a miss. There is much to appreciate in this game. If the animation and graphics are an issue for you there is an overhaul mod pack which adds much to the game, even at the cost to some of the original feel. But you can tweak it to be more faithful to the vanilla game.","November 11, 2014","true","12.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081010369/recommended/22320/","76561198081010369","Dubba_D","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081010369/","80 products in account","As a later TES fan, you may find it hard to believe that someone who actually started with Skyrim has found Morrowind to be their favorite installment in the series. But the thing is, Morrowind has a particular charm to it, despite it being over eleven years old. There are several things I'd like to discuss about Morrowind and why you should ultimately buy it, whether you're new to the TES series, or are a die-hard fan screaming for nostalgia.\n\nI'd like to create some points with Morrowind discussing its values:\n\n1. Presentation\n2. Gameplay\n3. Overall\n\nReady? Let's begin.\n\nPoint One: Presentation.\n\nAt first glance, Morrowind shows its age with the early Embryo engine with skeletal animation, and an average of 800 x 600 display. Also noticable is how NPC's stay within a general area without eating, drinking, or sleeping (sounds like a serious insomnia epidemic, no?). But besides that, there's nothing really flawed about the graphics, and it's actually reminiscent of Oblivion's. This gives Morrowind a sense of familiarity to begin with. You start off the game with a cinematic intro, as you awaken on an Imperial prison ship that has docked on an Imperial colony, Seyda Neen. From there, you enter your name, choose your race, and once you enter the Commision Office, you are asked to choose your birthsign, favored attributes, and class. From there on, you are asked to deliver a message to a man named Caius, and thus your quest begins. Or at least, the main quest begins. Like other TES games, what you do there on out is up to you. Fight monsters and bandits, loot tombs and ruins, join guilds and political factions, basically what you'd expect from an open-world RPG. That said, the island of Vvardenfell is wonderful, given you can see it, with the render distance and all. Cities aren't closed in separate maps like they were in Oblivion and Skyrim, and the geography is very immersive as you walk around, looking for your objective or simply looking for a dungeon to pillage. As you walk around Vvardenfell, you will encounter strange creatures, such as the Nix-Hound, the Alit, the Netches, and the infamous Cliff Racer. Imagination was really put into these monsters, and some of them won't be so easy to kill. As for the islands residents, Vvardenfell is home to the Dunmer, the ash-skined elves you've seen in the later or earlier installments. Their culture is reminiscent to that of Asian and some tribal cultures, as they may live in the shells of ancient arthropods, adobe buildings, giant mushrooms, and nomadic tents. You will also find your typical Imperial stone structures, things you may yawn about. The in-game literature in Morrowind is very well-written, providing fictional stories to amuse you with, informative tips about the local governments, cities, and religion, and even books that hint on certain gameplay aspects such as vampirism. It truly is something to see the thought lingers in your head.\n\nPoint Two: Gameplay\n\nAs for perhaps the most important aspect of any game, the gameplay element in Morrowind is quite different from the later installments ( and definitly Arena, but we aren't comparing.) The game offers a wide variety of skills to use, with various weapon types, from typical swords and warhammers, to spears and throwing stars, to crossbows and staves. There are also a wide variety of spells to use, from your average destruction and restoration spells, to teleportation, and even flying spells. Filed Soul Gems can be used on epuipment to enchant them, and an alchemy set can be used with flora, fauna, and even raw minerals to brew potions and poisons. Dialouge with NPCs is somewhat different, though, as they will communicate with text-based responses to the selected topic, and there are many things to talk about with NPCs. The thing about dialouge is despite these many topics, what they say is usually the same as everybody else. Copy-pasted, in fact, thus rendering many NPC void of real personality, unlike Oblivion and Skyrim. As for conflict with enemies, you may either hate it or simply don't care, as it works more like D&D role-playing games. Based on your skil with a certain weapon type, or the Agility attribute itself, you may miss an enemy point-blank while they take crackshots at you (though still able to miss.). Magic works similarly, as using less skilled magic type while tired out will usually result in failure to cast the spell. Aside from those questionable gameplay elements, however, there's still plenty to be had with Morrowind. You can't simply fast travel from the map so you could skip treking all the way to a destination, but rather you use public transportation, teleportation spells, and spells to increase your speed to move around Vvardenfell. Personally, this gave Morrowind a really huge look at the world map, even though it's only 10 square miles + 2-3 from the Bloodmoon expansion and about an additional one from Tribunal, compared to Cyrodill and Skyrim (16 square miles each) or even The Iilic Bay from Daggerfall, with a whopping 480,000 sqare miles (randomly generated though). Plus, you really got to know the geogrophy of Vvardenfell, as the game references landmarks and cities to help you navigate the world, all written in your little journal. Speaking of which, the journal system is probably the closest thing you'll have for a friend in this game ( besides Ahnassi, of course ). Quests and Topics are recorded on your journal with every indication. Viewing your journal is always very helpful if you've been sidetracked from looting dungeons or completing other side quests. That's not to say it isn't flawed, of course. Some quests give really bad direction and can be sometimes misleading. If you don't believe me, join House Redoran. This was really compensated in later installments with a quest marker, as a mere convinence. But don't let the gameplay issues deter you from purchasing this amazing title. Overall, the game function very well and even a late audience can find enjoyment out of it.\n\nPoint Three: Overall\n\nMany thing can be said about Morrowind to criticize it. The fact that NPCs had nearly no personality at all, a cumbersome combat and magic system, and even some broken quests do hurt Morrowind a little bit. But despite these cons, Morrowind is uplifted with many pros. Its lore will fascinate you, the landscape will amaze you, and your impact on the game world will really matter here. You truly can be what you want, whether that be a noble knight, a malevolent mage, an infamous assassin, or a troublesome thief, Morrowind can provide.\n\n\n\nThis game has been Dubb-approved","November 26, 2013","true","437.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Then, Doc Brown in a wizard robe fell from the sky.  I stole his icarus scrolls and his sick banana wizard outfit, then headed down the road through the 2spooky4me forest.  In this forest, I walked with swag, fought some skribs (heh heh... skrubs), and learned that you miss less if you use a smaller sword (wtf).\n\nSo I made it to Balmora.  Having learned of the <cough> excellent combat system in Morrowind, I went to the Mage Guild hoping to learn some good spells so I didn't have to deal with melee combat anymore.  Enemies could dodge and I couldn't, plus my Banana Wizard costume didn't have much armor.  On my first assignment for the mage guild, after I was done laughing at the... ahem, well-animated... khajit walking animations, I was sent on a noble and dangerous quest of... fetching mushrooms.  This is some Elder Scrolls Online ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I didn't sign up for AHEM\n\nSo anyway, I made it to the 2spooky4me swamp.  I stole some mushrooms, then took a nap.  When I woke up, a Dark Brotherhood guy came after me.  I just knew he was after my mushrooms, which he wanted to make weed out of.  I ♥♥♥♥♥slapped him with the sword and swung it a million times for 1000000x1 damage.  After he had been beaten to death with a glorified dinner fork, I stole his armor set and left.\n\nOn my return, I was gladly welcomed with-- another fetch quest.  But wait, this time it's flowers!  NO.\n\nI tried to flip the table.  Sadly, there's no physics-grab button like in Oblivion and Fallout 3, so the table was bolted to the floor as was every item until you picked it up.  I walked out as if I had flipped the table.\n\nDespite my hatred of the combat system, I go to the fighter's guild.  I'm sent right to the house next door to fight some baddies, but before I go I'm given full access to their arsenal.\n\nSo yes, this game taught me an important life lesson.

It is one of the greatest games of all time... now, after perhaps the buggiest release of all time.  Much of the fun was in breaking the game, despite the issues.  The atmosphere was msimply too brilliant for one to be bothered.  Jeremy Soule's soundtrack is perhaps one of the greatest game musical compositions, if not one of all media's greatest scores, enrapturing one in the turmoil & beauty of the lands.  Listening to the music inspires one to adventure, making even the most mudane of tasks seem exciting.\nMagic, similar to how the materia system of "Final Fantasy VII" is far better than 8, 9, or 10, thus the combination of all systems by "Final Fantasy XI"; a pattern we are hoping to find in "Elder Scrolls Online" but as of yet have not.  If you prefer "Skyrim" it is because you prefer movies to games, and the illusion of power, as opposed to actual hard earned skill.  "Skyrim" holds the player's hand, "Oblivion" less so, but just as much guilt.  "Morrowind" is open-ended, free, & a true adventure that more oft than not is out to kill you.  What makes that great is all of the ways one could circumvent death, notably levitation & the godly acrobatics skill, letting the player eventually create their own god.  The progression from nothing prisoner to god-killer feels right, usually around 40-100 hours depending on play style.  You will get there if you try, no matter the path, & that's amazing.\nFew games allow for such versatile gameplay style.\nYou must survive.  The Mods make this game epic, in the true sense of the word, with 1000s of miles and hours of player made content.  The plot of the regular world is incredible nonetheless, & the portrayal of power versus illusion is phenomenal.  The religious overtones are masks for the subversive nature of philisophical gnosticism...  This game will change you.   The lore is as real as "FFXI" yet more accessible, if more ethnocentric, most Pagans should find it refreshing to hear a proper rehashing of some of the more negative remnants of christian slander against witches & sorcerers.  Werewolves & Vampires make this game relavant to the popculture as "Morrowind's" lore is much more dependable than a lot of the garbage being floated around out there as vamp, or lycan, or fronts for far worse.\n\nBe safe, kids.  A lot of this is real, a lot is fantasy, just remember this;  It doesn't matter if someone calls themself a Vampire, Werewolf, or any sort of dangerous humanoid if if they are a crazy psychopath whom believes enough that it simply doesn't matter what you think.  Worse still, they could be a crazy psychopathic monster... and what then?  Don't take chances.  Don't do Skooma, stay in school, & actually read all the lore in RPGs.\n\nNow go, Vagabond!  Mod those graphics & remember you are discovering a story with hidden ancient lore and arcane secrets woven within.  This is not merely a game, it is a tome of riddles with the promise of truth & magic trapped for the ignorant, enchanted for the wise.  Therein lay a treasure for the Hero to unbind & wield:  The Philosopher's Stone, coicidencia oppositorum.\n\n"Morrowind" is the great American ARPG:  9.7/10\n\n- Found pipe, made Skooma, smoked... *Would Smoke again!* ...& again.

There's a lot more depth to this game than any of the Elder Scrolls games that have come since.\n\nI've probably spent a thousand hours playing Morrowind, and I still feel like I haven't seen it all (I haven't even spent much time on the two expansions).  In 2002 when Morrowind first came out on PC and Xbox, it was my life.  I loved the game so much I bought it for both systems.  My friends saw me playing it and several of them became addicts as well.  I was never turned off by the slow start or the difficulty in using your low level skills.  In fact, that was part of the fun for me - watching my character grow from someone who could hardly do ANYTHING in this world to a god-like juggernaut that could do ANYTHING in this world.  It's so satisfying, and much more satisfying than the character growth in any other game I've ever played, Elder Scrolls or not.\n\nThe spell creation system, which is sadly missing from newer Elder Scroll games, is so fun to play around with.  If you have the skill and money you can mix ANY of the spells together for some fun effects.  And there are a LOT more spells in this game.  Some are a little pointless (I've never figured out the point of the "Sound" spell) but some are tons of fun.  Levitate is a blast.  See something up high you can't get to?  Just Levitate up to it!  And the Jump/Slow Fall combo of spells is great.  You can do an uber-powerful jump, quickly flying through the sky for miles (or more/less, depending on how powerful your spells are) and then slowly, gently fall back to earth.\n\nThere are more weapons/stats including medium armor, spears and crossbows (great fun).  There are more factions.  The standard Fighter/Mage/Thieves guilds are there, but there are also TWO Dark Brotherhood type guilds, the Imperial Legion, the Blades, two religious guilds, vampire guilds, and three "House" guilds (although if memory serves me, you can only join one house).  And there is a LOOOOONG main quest.  So when I saw there's hundreds of hours of gameplay here, I don't mean hundreds of hours of aimlessly wandering the world.  It's real, substantial gameplay.\n\nBut the world of Morrowind is a world you'll WANT to spend hundreds of hours wandering.  It's exotic and different, espcially when compared to other Elder Scrolls games.  Giant mushroom trees may dot the landscape, some cities are built using the shells of huge craps, you're transported around the world in big bugs, wizards live in enormous plants, violent ashstorms darken the sky, animals or people disfigured by sickness attack you.  And around every corner you'll find something, such as large, bizarre looking Daedric temples; sunken ships or underwater caverns in the sea; or a lone farm in the wilderness.\n\nIf you've enjoyed Skyrim or Oblivion, you HAVE to play this game.  If you hear people complain about the graphics or clunky combat, ignore them and just play this game.  If you haven't played Skyrim or Oblivion, you HAVE to play this game.  It may take a little while to get past the old look and feel of this game, but you WILL get past it and you'll find that the more time you invest in Morrowind, the more satisfying and rewarding it becomes.  You'll feel a sense of accomplishment when every single one of your sword blows hit your opponent and when you sucessfully cast your spells every time.  Don't give up out of frustration because the questing system doesn't show you EXACTLY where to go, or because you can't fast travel EVERYWHERE.  That's a purposeful design choice to encourage exploration, and it promotes the feeling of a huge, open world.  In short, you HAVE to play this game.  It's the most rewarding game I've ever played, and it probably will be for you too if you allow yourself to become immersed in it.","July 28, 2014","true","227.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

However, this is a considerably unforgiving game overall.\n\nYou have to be careful not to go off the beaten path too much as enemies don't scale in level the way they do in this game's successors. There are also diseases which can give nasty effects to your character such as debuffs potentially lasting until the disease is cured though it can easily be done with potions that you should always have on you.\n\nYou also need to be sure you make good choices when it comes to creating your character so you can maximize your chances of survival and killing potential. It's probably best to select a predesigned class or even look online to get an idea of building your character effectively. This does NOT mean you have to follow them exactly and use cookie-cutter builds to succeed. They're just general rules of thumb which you can better understand with. This way you won't go around missing every swing and dying instantly to enemies.\n\nQuests take more attention than they do in successors because there's no compass pointing you to your objectives meaning you must read your journal to see the directions there which aren't always 100% accurate. While this can be confusing and you may just not enjoy it, it serves to better immerse you into the experience and encourage you to explore the surrounding areas of the quests.\n\nThe last possibly negative things I'd like to mention are the various exploits and bugs. You should definitely install the fan made patches, that you can find online for free which should fix the majority of the bugs that would otherwise make it a terribly glitchy experience. As far as exploits, these can be avoided if you choose to and play the game normally, but from what I've heard, alchemy can really unbalance the game with things like flying above enemies and shooting them and buffing up to near invisibility. However, you might find this to be a fun aspect of the game.\n\nThere are many other things to learn that I didn't cover like this such as disposition and fatigue so I'd encourage anyone to look up some information to guide you a bit where a manual might have if you had a physical copy. This won't take anything from the experience (depending on where you look), unless you're the type who likes to go into a game and figure everything out the hard way, and it will probably prevent a lot of frustration for a beginner.\n\nTo talk about the good, I'm sure you could easily look online to find a cult following gushing about this game, but from my own experience, the reason I enjoy this the most in the series is it's complexity, depth, and thematically alien feeling. You can look up what makes this game comparatively deeper and complex than the others with things like each individual weapon type being a skill and how the many factions interact with you and each other, but I just want to mention the world.\n\nMorrowind is a very strange place compared to the other games and real life in general. The environment includes ashlands which are essentially barren shadows of past volcanic eruptions that have caused dry, dusty terrain with calderas mostly providing the only form of pass through the many impassable (without flying) mountains. There's also the 'West Gash Region' which is hard to describe, but definitely unusual. There are other places more familiar like the 'Bitter Coast' being swampland, more that I can't name that are grasslands, beach, shallow waterered areas with stones and land sticking up from it with giant thorn trees where flying wizards reside, a lake area with different plantation grounds where slaves work. Most of the biomes contain giant mushrooms which act as trees. There's even an island in the Northwest, provided in one of the expansions that come with this version where there are traditional forests, ice areas and snowy places. So Morrowind cetainly has the most various environments of the last three Elder Scrolls.\n\nThe native npcs themselves where insect armor, ride giant insects to other areas, use large reptiles to serve as mules, have a strange religion featuring many of their own gods not seen in the other games, have cities on water and shun any 'outlanders'. There are also ash dwellers who live in tribes that celebrate the banned god Nerevar who acts as a central plot - point to the story.\n\nThe story is compelling enough, but it's the presentation that makes it great. You don't know a lot of what's going on when you first get to Morrowind and you only find out through books, npcs who are reluctant to inform you, and other npcs who help further the plot along. It's a very mysterious game.\n\nSimply put, this game demands a lot from you, but it's extremely satisfying when you succeed and win the main quest, not to mention all the side quests and definitely rewards you for being invested in the story and lore which are truly deserving of the word 'fantasy'.","May 9","true","139.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

An incredible journey of discovery, betrayal, deicide, vengeance, and conquest spreads out from there.\n\nOpen world game with heavy RPG elements and storyline.\n\nThe Good\nVery well-polished game with the old "Daggerfall" Kirkbride lore touch, which is to say "you can drown in the world's content".  The plot is sublime, with hours of invested time needed to complete it, with epic proportions matched only by juggernauts of the gaming industry.  The engine allows for an incredible amount of flexibility and freedom - you can spend time to become any kind of character you would desire, and there are multiple paths to get to the final plot.\n\nDetail is given to pretty much everything in the game, and if you are a curious explorer, you can get lost in the environment.  Despite the outdated graphics by today's standards, the sheer level of content is overwhelming, and sets a standard that is sadly unmet since.  The musical score matches the scale of the setting, and fans of the game will instantly recognise the strains of Morrowind's soundtrack - along with the pang of longing that it will bring.\n\nBethesda kept to it's normal tradition of making the game extremely moddable, and even supported the game well past the three expansions they released for it; more quests and equipment has been released officially[www.elderscrolls.com] simply to enhance the game that little bit more, and if you wish to mod it further with extra content, the Nexus[www.nexusmods.com] holds a lot of quality content.\n\nThe Bad\nThe UI is often confusing and convoluted*, with bizarre choices for default keys (E to jump, space to interact) and there is often a lack of explanation for terms and controls.  The melee interface is not intuitive, and for modern gamers will feel lacking for the effort you need to take.\n\nModern players will be more than slightly turned off by the very aged graphics*, and the sound effects are somewhat lacking*.  The plot does not often leave much explanation for steps needing to be taken, which can leave confusion and frustration in it's wake.  Almost everything in the wilderness wants to kill you.\n\nAs usual, Bethesda's game engine is less than stable; an official set of patches are available here[www.paulcarr.com.au], and here[www.nexusmods.com], to counter this.\n\n* Suggestions to alleviate this are listed below.\n\nThe Ugly\nCliff racers.  The begging elf in Tribunal.\n\nSuggestions\nPlayers will likely want to download and install the unofficial patches[www.paulcarr.com.au], and the code patch[www.nexusmods.com], to stabilize the engine; then the Morrowind Sound & Graphics Overhaul[www.ornitocopter.net] to improve the quality of the UI, default sounds, and graphics somewhat.  Following that, the official content patches[www.elderscrolls.com] add extra content, and the Tamriel Rebuilt[www.nexusmods.com] project will add even more to the sandbox you have to roam in.\n\nAfter all of that, if you care to do some more modding, the game world is, proverbially, your oyster.\n\nThe Summary\n9/10 for this one, simply because the sheer amount of content and effort they put in overcomes a good portion of the poor graphics, the bugs, and poor UI choices they made.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 25, 2014","true","85.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

I predominantly spent my time playing it on the Xbox.\n\nSome say that it is a bit dated on the graphics front but you have to remember that this game is 12 years old. Despite this, however, I think as far as the graphics and the general game play goes it was way ahead of it's time.\n\nWith Morrowind you really don't start with much and you really don't get a lot of help. The sheer fact that you have to work hard to get other characters in the game to like you enough to actually tell you anything worthwhile is gripping.\n\nYou can join a whole host of different factions and this helps to build your character. As some factions do not like each other you can end up being slightly more disliked by one faction or race than another.\n\nUltimately the games main story line never changes but the multitude of side quests is mind boggling and if you can't even be bothered with those you can spend an age just running around collecting valuable and rare items and increasing your stats to almost godly levels\n\nThe animals: If you think that Dragons are bad my goodness you haven't met a Cliff Racer\n(Be mega wary of the diseased or blighted ones especially if you are a weaker character)\n\nFavourite 'Easter Egg': It has to be the Mudcrab Merchant. If you find this little guy make sure you have a Mark and Recall spell so you can find him again as he is situated on a tiny island in the middle of no-where. He is the richest merchant in the entire game\n\nLittle tip: Listen to the music. The music is set to warn you of any impending danger. If you are being attacked it will change quickly, if you are going to be it will be more subtle (But don't be fooled sometimes the game likes to play the first few notes of the attack sequence music before launching into the normal calm outdoors music)\n\nI did write a slightly longer review originally but couldn't fit it all in.

It is still the best of all the Elder Scrolls games, because of the magnitude of the game for its time and the back-to-basics approach in role-playing - tremendous storyline, realistic characterisation, interaction and progression.\n\nThere are weaknesses to this game however, the UI is not particularly helpful to meta-gamers (c.f.

What I am saying is that the game did not have very many repetitive quests. I could go on for ever, but in the long run I absoulty would recommend this game!","July 19, 2015","true","10.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Player choice and character skill is what matters. In Skyrim and Oblivion, progress in the game is controlled by point-and-click combat and mini games where player skill is what matters. In Morrowind, the skill of a character is what matters, with hidden dice rolls and comparisons controlling successes and failures.\nSome will complain that the combat is clunky, and that they hate missing a rat 20 times and dying as a result. But if you have a skill of 5 in short blade, why are you using a dagger? Building or picking a class, allocating attribute points correctly, and choosing a logical strategy for your character is what makes this game so much different from Skyrim, where anyone can cast spells, swing swords, and sneak with extreme proficiency.\nBy making you start off small, learn and mold your character's strengths and weaknesses, and lick the boots of every NPC around you, Morrowind lets you grow from a worthless, scummy, ex-con n'wah to the all powerful, well respected Nerevar Incarnate.","May 31, 2014","true","103.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

On this level, as a game to be interacted with Morrowind required much improvement, partially done by modders that covered over and developed the game in directions the smaller group of original developers would never have managed.\n\nMorrowind is still an excellent game if you want to truly explore a fantasy environment that is utterly unique, and become immersed and explore an alien world, with skills and abilities that far surpass those offered to players in earlier and later Elder Scrolls games. Although not as technically accomplished as its sequels, Morrowind more than excels them in its vibrant and diverse world.","December 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It has a few features which other Elder Scrolls games failed to accomplish. The ability to kill every single npc in the game you want, regardless if it's part of a quest or not; The lack of quest markers and instead having to rely on directions and your common sense; The privilege of taking any house you want and call it your own. Not only that: the world feels completely different. It's not your average fantasy game filled with unicorns and dragons, instead the game throws more unique creatures at you: Kwama's, Nix-Hound's, Netches, Ogrim's, Kagouti just to name a few.\n\nCombat\nSome people hate it. Others love it. It depends on how you look at it. While in combat hitting someone does not necessarily mean it actually hits. Lots of factors play a role in this, such as the amount of stamina you have, how skilled you are in the weapon category (daggers, spears, longswords etc) and your agility attribute. If these parameters are high enough the game makes it count as a hit. The more you use a weapon in a certain category the more skilled you will become and thus essentially making you hit your target more often. This however also means you cannot easily switch from weapon to weapon. If your skill in daggers is 90 and you found an axe which does approximately 10 more damage than your current weapon it might be a better idea to stick with your dagger and move on as your low skill in axes might put you at a disadvantage.\n\nExploration\nExploring is extremely rewarding. There's always something cool and new to discover such as finding a wood elf plummeting to his death who carries the infamous scrolls of icarian flight which allows you to jump tremendous distances. Or who could have known the legendary dragon bone cuirass is locked away in a closet on a random island in the middle of nowhere? You will never know what treasures and garbage a cave has hidden.\n\nQuests\nAs mentioned above there are no quest markers present in Morrowind. Instead you will need to rely on your brain and directions given by npc's. Quest items can also be freely sold to any merchant even though this may mean permanently breaking the entire quest once the merchant has stocked up on different wares.","July 31, 2014","true","107.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Imagine three times the quests and content of Skyrim compressed into one small island, with so much lore and depth that you can lose yourself for hours and hours. Sure, it isn't a really pretty game, but slap MGSO on it and you've got an astonishingly good looking game to complement it's other aspects. You see, in Skyrim you find out you are dragonborn... cool! Yes, that means you get to incinerate people, make them fly off of cliffs etc. In Morrowind though, you start off as almost weaker than mudcrabs, but become a GOD by the end of the game, quite literally. Feel like flying around the whole map without even needing console commands? Go ahead. Want to jump like a super hero from Seyda Neen to Balmora? Do it! Kill the end game boss in one hit? Yes, you can do that. The possibilities are endless, and even though all of the above is true, that doesn't mean you're the strongest thing around, there are still monsters that are quite dangerous even in the late game, see what's different between newer entries and Morrowind? Yes, FREEDOM, to become whatever you like. Now, Morrowind isn't perfect, but it's probably the best game in the series. These days, even though it has aged well enough, it can be very difficult to get into, and since you are thrown instantly into a massive world with only a small dagger, quite confusing. But don't give up. Keep playing, and you could turn your 3 hours of frustration into your 300 hour playthrough of the best game experience you've ever had.\n\nSo I don't think I need to tell you how much I recommend this game. But as I said, it's not without flaws, it's simply that the strong points make it so amazing that you won't need to worry about the flaws. I think there is something in this game for everyone, and it's an experience that can't be missed. Grab it in the christmas sale (it's almost always on sale then), grab MGSO, also known as Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul, and make sure your body is ready for one of the best PC games ever made.

Thank you, because it is much better than Skyrim or Oblivion. All are good, but Morrowind is the divine roast beef among fast food cheeseburgers. The gameplay is excellent, and requires specialization in order to perform well. This contrasts with the other games, which try to tie all of the weapon classes together and kinda make everything simple and boring. Exploration and world design are oh so beautiful, and travelling around Vivec completing various guild quests fills me with a special feeling. Wow. MMMMM. OH YEAH. Even though I've put less hours into this game, I never got that in the rest of the series. Instead I just had the desire to get to the next objective as quickly as possible.

Never touched em. Always wanted to.\n\nThen one day I got this craving to look into it. I saw a video on youtube about "why you should play Morrowind in 2015" and it made me want the game so mcuh I cried a little. So I got the game. And modded the ♥♥♥♥ outta it! Jesus... my game looks so good now and has so many cool new features. I actually really enjoy the fact combat is treated like dice rolls (but far far far more complex... actually the game is so complex it would be a nightmare to actually write out the formulas for a good 1 vs 1 fight). I love Skyrim. I love Oblivion. I love New Vegas. I love Morrowind. Each of these are so different in their own way but to me they all end up being a tie. Plus the fact there are so many amazing mods for each of these games.\n\nIf you grew up playing pen and paper RPGs like I did, you enjoy reading in your video games, you enjoy old skool progression (start out weak as heck and end up super over powered) and you want a completely amazing new experience... then this is your game.

I thought that my game was bugged because I was getting point blank misses. Now, however, this is my favorite game of all time. Though it was a hard start, I can tell you why this game is so amazing.\nYou start the game extremely underpowered, with a set of terrible clothes, a dagger, 87 gold and, if you are smart. some extra trinkets to sell and a terrible lockpick.\nI would also like to note that this is a hardcore RPG with a few action concepts, such as real time combat. However, much of the game is based on your character's skill, not your skill. So, if you have a bad short blade skill, you will get at least 9 out of 10 hits as a miss. In fact, I would even argue that this game and skyrim (I have played both) can be classified into different subgenres because of the differences.\nLater in the game, it is the opposite of the beginning. You become an unbeatable god. It is the greatest feeling I have ever had in a game. This is why I reccomend this game.\nOne more thing to add.

You can even go to Solstheim and do lots of cool stuff there that is also there in the Skyrim version of Solstheim. There is alot more good things but its hard to say them without spoiling it so go check for yourself.\n\nTHE BAD STUFF:\nOnly few bad things was I didn't like was combat, its like rolling a dice or something to hit the enemy so if you have bad stats you will miss alot, BUT if you take time to level your stats up or go to trainers for your skills you will rarely miss, unless someone casts spells to lower your stats or you fight an enemy with high luck/agility. Ranged combat sucks even more if its not leveled up high enough, you will waste so much arrows but it does make some fights easier. Another kinda bad thing is the game is really slow compaired to the other games but you can make potions and spells or find enchanted items to make you move faster.\n\n\n\nI reccomend this game if you love difficult RPGs and Elder Scrolls, with a few mods you can fix up all the problems and have lots of fun!","August 7, 2011","true","93.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

If you havent ever tried Morrowind, but for an example played Skyrim or Oblivion, you most likely cant enjoy this game. Morrowind still has more RPG elements than Oblivion or Skyrim has, and that makes Morrowind so much better than the newer installations in the series. Want to kill gods and use their souls to make extremely powerful weapons? Did you happen to kill an important character that is connected to the main questline, but still want to complete it? Possible in Morrowind, but not in skyrim or Oblivion. In Morrowind each time you start a new game, you are thrown into the world as a new person, not dragonborn or "the hero of Kvatch". Each time you have the opportunity to create a character of your own choise and not let the game make decicions for you, like in Skyrim or Oblivion. Morrowind is not only the best game I have ever played, but also contains the best DLC pack I have ever played; Tribunal.

(and Dagoth Ur, remember that place from Arena?)\n\nIt's amazing how you start as such a lowly and disgusting outlander, then you start to hone your abilities and stay true to who you're loyal to, and then you have the power to do anything you want! Then you're an invincible demi-god with 1000 acrobatics EASILY jumping across and around the whole map. The game for me is about the freedom to do anything, anywhere. The only limitations are the hardware and the engine, so go frickin' nuts.\n\nThough the game DOES have its flaws.\n-  RNG based combat (dice rolls) Excusable though, seeing how this is an RPG. Just seems odd to have RNG based combat in a game like this though.\n-  Uninteresting NPCs and boring towns\n-  Bugs.. Every (especially Bethesda) game has these though.\n\nRegarding the combat, I don't think combat has ever been good in an Elder Scroll game, especially the swing your mouse at the enemy type of combat in Arena in Daggerfall. The combat is this game fortunately doesn't depend on swinging your mouse like a madman (and RNG!).. but instead is dependent on dice rolls(same thing). The game takes every possible factor from how much fatigue you have to how far your enemy to your agility to your weapon skills is to determine whether you'll hit or miss. Your skill with a weapon also determines your chance to hit with that type of weapon, for example, you're more likely to hit enemies with Spear 100 then Spear 25 while using a spear.\n\nDespite its minor and/or major flaws, these can be fixed, and Morrowind still remains as a masterpiece that can never be replicated, which is why people are STILL playing the game in 2014, and why I'll still be playing in 2015.","December 6, 2014","true","245.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

It's plenty easy to be turned off by its dated graphics and interface, but if you stick with it, you'll find a real gem of a game. As much as I like Oblivion and Skyrim, they both feel like they've gone through a streamlining process that left them as much more generic fantasy worlds. Morrowind has a lot of character that its sequels lose, and provides the player with many more options than they have in Oblivion and even Skyrim. If you're a fan of the series, Morrowind is a must play game, and since it's a Bethesda game, there are plenty of mods out there to help make the game look and feel a little more modern.\n\nPlus you can totally enchant a pair of pants with a slowfall enchantment and name them Parachute Pants.","January 30, 2014","true","0.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Started actually playing the game after periods of playing for a bit and then stopping for ages. I'm hooked now. Im only level 3, but I'm so enthralled by the game and how fun and addictive it is. I've played almost all the Bethesda games, Skyrim, Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. I loved them all, so naturally, I thought I would try it out after hearing so many positive things about it. It's extremely hard and unrewarding at the beginning, because it does'nt hold your hand. Also, the combat is a dice roll mechanic, meaning the more skilled you are with a particular weapon, the more likely you are to hit your target. I know it sounds a bit odd, but it's a gem of a game. Stick with it, it's so worth it. Keep grinding and keep your eye on the prize, and you'll have no problem with the game. 10/10 definitely recommend.","July 18, 2014","true","21.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've played oblivion, skyrim, and online too, and I still always come back to play Morrowind.\nTo get a good idea of the level of detail and vastness of the game, have a look at the Morrowind UESP Wiki. I loved browsing all the stuff I didn't yet know about on that wiki.\n\nI'll put the game in perspective though... It's old, looks old, feels old. It can be boring and slow at times, and very hard. You may die a lot at first as your levels are crap, you may keep inflicting no damage hit after hit in combat untill you get your levels up. Walking will take ages and you will probably get lost and not be able to find your destination. BUT if you can push your way through the hardships at first and get use to the game and the world of Morrowind, then you will find some very challenging and enjoyable rpg game play! As you get the hang of the game, you will also love that the learning and discovering does not stop there! You will keep finding new and awesome things!!! Have a look at my positives list for why I loved the game and what it's main attraction points are.\n\nAnyway, positives and negatives!!!\nPositives:\n-Extremely rich detail in all key game areas! Loads of different armour types(and I recon the old quality graphics makes everything look really detailed and realistic due to a more rough/worn look). Loads of different weapon types, there are spears, staffs, throwing knives, even ninja stars!!! Loads of unique items. A lot more guilds/factions than the other TES games, there is fighters, mages, thieves, imperial legion, imperial cult, east empire trading company, morag tong, tribunal temple, aundae/berne/quarra clan, ashlander tribes, and all the Great Houses of Morrowind(Hlaalu, Redoran, and Telvanni).\n-Great sound track! Classic Elder Scrolls amazing music.\n-Good voice actors(lol oblivion), the unique and outlandish voices for some of the cool characters/races really serve to immerse you in the game. If it bothers you though, there is a narrow range of different voices...\n-Awesome spells!!! There are levitation spells for goodness sake!!\n-Ban Hammer item :D\n-Detailed quests/game information/history.\n-Good books, (The Lusty Argonian Maid).    ;)\n-Dungeons and ruins and tombs and ship wrecks and dwemmer ruins and forts and caves and bandit camps and bandit hideouts and tons of cool locations EVERYWHERE! You will never run out of places to explore!\n-Some very uniqe scenery/settings in Morrowind. The tree/plant/mushroom buildings of the Telvanni people are awesome!\n-Great loot everywhere, hidden.\n-Also, just the level of detail put into the game by the developers is great. Rarely will you have a 'boring' quest or dungeon, there is often cool little features put in, or cool background stories that serve no purpose but to intrigue! I can remember many occasions where I have gone into a cave or such and been really challenged with actually navigating it, the path to the objective/destination can be hidden really well.\n-I have to emphasise the point of amazing in game detail! xD I just loved how there was so much to do and all of it felt unique and challenging. I loved moments like breaking into vaults filled with treasures in Vivec. Or finding amazing loot just placed in hiding spots for you to find, that could really help you in game, I recall the 'Sword of White Woe' being hidden in a guard tower ontop of a tall wardrobe. I could either use my stealth to get it, lure the guard, or assassinate the guard... I assassinated. :D\n-Differnet quality lockpicks, and probes(probes are used to disarm traps on doors/chests). Also different quality alchemy tools, and not  just a mortar and pestle, but also alembic, retort, and callcinator! I really felt like an alchemist with all those tools in Master Quality.\n-The enchantments on enchanted items can be cast as normal spells! A ring can have healing on it and may have 5 uses an ingame day, so you can keep that ring handy to heal you through out your exploring! (Fargoth heuheu)\n-Your player gold as an actual item!!! So you can store it! I really liked that. :)\n-Jiub.\n\n\nNegatives:\n-Walking is really slow... So when you have to make that inevitable long trip where there are no transportation or teleportation methods, it will take ages.\n-Cliff Racers.\n-Some people may hate the lack of guidance in the game; I loved the extra challenge though and I found it forced me to get fully immersed in the game. I really had to listen to/read and remember what people said.\n-It's hard to sell your really expensive items as there are not many vendors with large sums of gold...\n-"You are over encumbered"....\n\nSkyrim why u no have levitation :(","December 8, 2014","true","113.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

No other game in the franchise manages to give you a sense of scale than Morrowind, sure Skyrim and Cyrodiil are bigger in terms of Map size, but Morrowind just "feels" bigger. What you will notice right off the bat is how intricate the combat system is,  this isn't just hack and slash until your enemy dies, your skill level with the appropriate weapon type determines how often you land a hit. If you have a great Long Blade skill but use daggers, you are going to have an agrivating time. The graphics won't blow you away, not by a long shot, but the feel and the exploration more than make up for it. 9/10 You need to play this.","January 2, 2015","true","10.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While traveling across the province of Morrowind, you will encounter a wide array of NPCs, both mundane and intriguing. The combat is the worst of the past three Elder Scrolls, but you have a sense of peril unlike the more recent installments in the series. Some people give the idea that Morrowind is the most "hardcore" Elder Scroll game, which will cause some to waffle on purchasing the game. In reality, Morrowind is really not that hard of a game, sure, when you first start off things WILL be difficult, but once you get the hang of things and level up, it becomes a pleasant experience. Overall, if you find open world games, western RPGs, and/or adventure games your thing, you should purchase Morrowind.

It is a bit buggy, the combat is outdated, the fighting noises are laughable, there's not enough storage room in containers and you have to actually read stuff from the quest givers otherwise you will have no clue.

Its one of a kind and the very eccense of the game series, the difficulty and over all the unforgiving world you'll be in for the next several months will be tough, you will get lost and figure out how to walk for once instead of quick travel. Almost every action you make will take effect on things in the world. Npc's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but they learn to grow on you and begin to enjoy your company as the game progresses. Just about everything in this game will make you work for it there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doubt about it. but once you figure out how everything works and just be enthrawled into morrowind you will be satisfied like taking a huge dump. Morrowind is one of those challenges that we all must play in gaming atleast once, to remember that rpg's like this are slowly slipping away. I recommend this to any hardcore gamer or just anyone up for a challenge :) this has my thumb of approval.","September 13, 2015","true","26.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I had first played Morrowind back in Middle School on the old Xbox system and fell in love with the world, the mystery, and the open endedness of the game world. After wanting the game really bad, I decided to purchase it on Steam and it was a wise decision. Morrowind gives the player the ability to truly do whatever they please, create the character of their dreams, and explore an enormous world with amazing characters, creatures, and cities to explore. The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is certainly one of the best Elder Scrolls games I have played out of the entire series and I wish more of the game would have the same feel as Morrowind. I would certainly recommend Morrowind if you love a good RPG, but also if you love open ended exploreation and the ability to go anywhere and do anything you please. Out of 5 stars, I would give Morrowind a 5.\n\nAlso included in this purchase is the official expansion packs for Morrowind as well. The first expansion pack The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal takes the player to a new location called Mournhold the capital of Morrowind Proper. The expansion is exciting but after a few hours of exploring it does get boring as it is possible to discover everything you can in this expansion. The city does add more quests to the game which is exciting but the quests are certaintly not easy and may take a while, but that is what makes the expansion great. Of course if you purchase Morrowind on Steam you will automantically get this expansion, but out of 5 stars, I would give Tribunal a 3.\n\nThe second expansion pack is The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon, which adds a large island territory called Solstheim which the player can travel to and complete new quests to stop the Bloodmoon prophecy from taking place. The island adds even more beautiful scenery, creatures, and towns and cities to be discovered. It is certainly an entertaining expansion as the player is exposed to new landscapes different from those of Vvardenfell and it adds yet another good 15 hours to the already massive game. Of course if you purchase Morrowind on Steam you will automatically get this expansion, but out of 5 stars, I would give Bloodmoon a 5.","May 12, 2015","true","13.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This easily one of the best games ever made. At the very least, it's one of the best RPGs ever made.  (THE best in my humble opinion.) It's depth and complexity is completely unlike any game made today. There is infintely more to every single aspect of the game than just what meets they eye. The quests, the main story, the characters, the magic, the stat system.\n-There is absolutely no hand holding\n-This game will never forgive you for being inexperienced\n-You can't just go around chopping everything in your path to bits like you can in Skyrim. There are creatures that will absolutely decimate you without mercy.\n-You'll get lost trying to find places (A lot)\n-You'll get confused and stuck on quests\n-You will struggle to create a character with decent stats\n-You will miss important items or details\n-Spend hours upon hours trudging through the wilderness at a snail's pace\n-I'm not joking. Speed is an ACTUAL SKILL you have to level up.\n-You will fail to hit a mudcrab standing right in front of you with your weapon\n-You will be forever finding new gameplay mechanics, locations, or items you never knew existed.\n-You will love the music\n-You will develop and ungodly hatred for cliffracers\n-YOU CAN KILL MAIN QUESTLINE CHARACTERS. Pay attention. If you kill certain characters you might not ever be able to complete some quests or guilds.\n\nThe game is not without it's shortcomings, but (some of) it's flaws are part of the fun. Yes, the graphics are bad but it's 15 years old for crying out loud. That's what mods are for. The combat system can be frustrating at first when your skills are low. There is no magicka generation. Glicthes, bugs and exploits are not uncommon.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE- This game is an absolute masterpiece. Buy it right now. Cherish it, bask in it's glory.

Well this game is hard, at first. Your journey from level one to two is probably going to be one of the hardest journey's you'll face; leveling up for the first time is truly an achievement. Well the kind of player who has played this about a hunderd times might say Morrowind is easy-there are so many exploits, yes that is true but I doubt a first time player would know that you can make effects permanent by soul trapping yourself, or that you could lower your skill to zero and receive training for one gold. Well Morrowinds first immpression might not be the best because well the graphics might make you want to regurgitate, but some of the areas in the game hold up fairly well, but then again you do get the areas that make you want to regurgitate, but thanks to some truly talented modders have released a wide array of mods to fix that. Well combat is rather infuriating, my friend recently picked this up and we almost threw the laptop he was playing on in the ocean, but there is a mod called accurate attack to solve this problem. Most problems with Morrowind can be fixed with mods but don't mod the living hell out of it because you're really not going to get the full experience, I know I did and I enjoyed Morrowind alot more without all the mods. I think Morrowind is a master peice and that's because so much thought and detail was put into this,this really felt like a living breathing world; everything from the fast travel to the factoin clothing,even the fact that you could equip 15 different clothing pieces and that siad clothes influence how society looks at you. I can go on and on about depth but this is really something to experience for yourself. There is just so much to find and do; this really is the type of game where every time you play it you find something new and you become more educated about it. I really love this game it's definitely one of my favorite games, but then again this isn't for everyone but if this game is for you I really recommend this 9.5/10.","April 14","true","169.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trapgrandpa/recommended/22320/","trapgrandpa","trap grandpa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trapgrandpa/","17 products in account","I'm splitting my review into a few major talking points - feel free to skip to  the end for a tl;dr. If you haven't played Morrowind, you should buy this game and at least attempt to play 3-5 hours before deciding you don't like it.\nFor a new player that hasn't been recently/ever exposed to, or doesn't enjoy, old games - Morrowind will require effort to play for the first few hours. I purchased Morrowind GOTY Edition in 2003; I've easily logged 400+ hours of gameplay over the last 13 years, and this is by far, my favorite game of all time.  Depsite this fact, it did take some time after just recently buying this game on Steam to adjust to the gameplay.\n\nTalking point breakdown:\n\n1. Morrowind was released in 2002. You can bash the quality of the graphics, the seemingly clunky gameplay, and the numerous gameplay bugs - but you need to realize, this was two-thousand and ****ing two we're talking about. In 2002, an above-average computer would have less than 512MB of RAM, a 50GB HDD (keeping in mind SATA didn't exist yet), and a single-core processor that may rarely exceed 2GHz. Today, you can buy a mobile phone with equivalent or greater processing power, storage, and memory for 1/10th of the price. That being said, you can't expect this game to be the lovechild of Skyrim and Crysis 3. This game was incredibly advanced for its time, and managed to be years ahead of competing RPGs for several years following its release.\n\n2. Morrowind was designed and developed, in its entirety, by a team of less than forty engineers, artists, musicians, and writers. Skyrim, the most recent installment of the TES series, required ninety people to make a game that is effectively equivalent in size to both of its two predecessors (Oblivion and Morrowind).\n\n3. Morrowind features depth in character development, lore, dialog, and faction stories that is unparalleled, even by modern standards. During this game, we're put into a world of religious fanatacism, xenophobia, feudalism, political struggle, corruption, and betrayal. Though this game may not feature the faction mechanics of Fallout 4, players who invest their interest will be put in the position to question their role in shaping Vvardenfell's future.\n\n4. Morrowind uses cultural, geographic, political, and architectural variety to create an incredibly unique world for the player to explore. In my opinion, recent TES installments (futhermore, modern games in general) seem to fall short when it comes to giving players an environment with any form of variety. Both Skyrim and Oblivion (the latter of which I enjoyed thoroughly), feature textbook fantasy land and cityscapes with left-versus-right conflicts/themes (Oblivion vs. Empire, Tamriel vs. Dragons). In comparison, Morrowind features six local political factions, three skill-based factions, three religious factions, and four large-scale government-like organizations. The combination of these political, geographical, and religious influences effectively shape the architecture, social behavior, and demographics of each area.\n\n5. Morrowind's skill, leveling, and difficulty systems are significantly more complex and intimidating than Oblivion's or Skyrim's. In Skyrim/Oblivion, you can walk into an arbitrary dungeon on your first day and fight levelled enemies with armor in your current tier. In Morrowind, you can stumble into a dungeon only to find that the enemies are anywhere from 1-30 levels above you, with weapon/armor tiers anywhere from iron to daedric. Players need to understand that this is how the game was intended to be, as the difference between entry-level and end-game areas/content should be fairly clear. As for the division of melee skills into weapon classifications, that's just how it was done - you'll learn to adapt into a clear playstyle once you actually play the game, instead of writing a scathing review after you realize this isn't an old, shot-for-shot remake of Skyrim.\n\n6. In Morrowind, the development team wasn't afraid to push the boundries on creativity of flora/fauna. The game features everything from sky-jellyfish to dinosaurs, and fire-blasting beetles to hog-riding snowpeople. This is something that isn't really seen, at least to the same extent, in Oblivion/Skyrim - whose worlds feature fairly mundane creatures in comparison.\n\n7. Morrowind's journal/navigation/quest system was designed to have the player commit to their role in the game. As it is in real life, you don't immediately know where a foreign location is because someone tells you about it - you need to explore, ask around, and eventually locate it yourself. Furthermore, if you want to understand what is actually going in, you need to pay attention to the dialog. Unlike Skyrim, the quality/depth of the story is greater than that of middle schooler's creative writing assignment - so it's worth paying attention to what's going on.\n\n9.  **** This is my most important point **** - if you haven't completed, or even played Morrowind previously, DO NOT USE ONLINE GUIDES OR VIEW QUEST WALKTHROUGHS WHILE YOU PLAY. When I first owned this game, I did not have Internet regularly available to me. This game features puzzles, riddles, clues, and directions that are effectively spoiled if you cheat and use guides.\n\n9. Finally, I do have to address some of the points that many of the negative reviews on this game dwell over.\ni) The combat system is not seamless; you don't always hit with arrows and swords, and (especially at the start) casting spells successfully is quite annoying. Whether or not these features are intentional is debated; however, it does not by any means make the game unplayable.\n\nii) Players who started with Skyrim/Oblivion may not like the way enchanting and alchemy are carried out.\n\niii) The graphics to this game, obviously, aren't on par with Skyrim or Oblivion. Just remember that this game is probably older (or at least more mature) than you, if you started on Skyrim/Oblivion.\n\niv) Morrowind still has many bugs, some of which can be gamebreaking.  Do not be afraid to investigate how to use the console to fix issues. Useful commands include PlaceAtPC, RA, and PCJoinFaction - at least for resolving issues with disappearing characters, quest glitches, etc. Bethesda games have, and continue to feature many bugs at/after release, and Morrowind is no exception.\n\nv) Morrowind is, by no means, optimized for the modern computer. This game was designed when people considered Windows XP to be advanced technology.\n\nvi) Since the class/level system is more complicated than Skyrim/Oblivion, first-time players may have difficulty effectively creating/choosing a class. For a first-time character to explore all content, I recommend a custom class with 2-3 melee weapon skills (long blade, blunt weapon, and short blade offer the most amount of weapons), 2-3 magic skills (destruction, restoration, alteration are most entertaining, in my opinion), 2 armor skills (light and heavy are most useful long-term), marksman (because of throwing stars, darts, crossbows, bows), and athletics/acrobatics/whatever else you like.\n\n**** tl;dr ****\nMorrowind is a great game; personally my favorite. If you've never tried it before, I thoroughly recommend you put in the effort and give it a try, Though Morrowind is old and very different mechanically than Oblivion/Skyrim, it's quite possibly the best installment in the TES series because of the uniqueness of the environment, story, and lore.","March 5","true","78.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I had heard many great things about it, mostly about how it emulated Gothic and the Might & Magic series which made it seem very interesting to me. And while I don't hold it in the same high esteem as many other fans it is still a game I did enjoy despite it's many flaws.\n\nMorrowind is an exploration driven RPG. What that means is essentially that the story, combat and skills take a backseat to a huge open world that you can explore at will with little or no boundaries imposed. Now what separates a good exploration RPG from a bad one is both the uniqueness of the locations you can explore and especially the challenge of those locations. One of the worst mistakes an exploration RPG can make is to use leveled enemies or any similar system. If the chance of you entering a new cave only to be running out 30 seconds later with a big scary monster in close pursuit is a non factor then it will quickly become boring and predictable. Likewise if every location is too similar to the last one you will lose that driven to find new caves and castles to loot.\n\nWhile the challenge you get from skipping too far ahead is not quite as good as you can find in other games and the locations do have a number of repeats Morrowind still does a good enough job that you will want to keep searching for new locations and secrets. A number of very cool travel abilities, in particular the one that allows you to jump halfway across the island in a single bound, makes for some very good exploration at times.\n\nIn terms of combat however the game is very simple and not very entertaining, killing enemies feels more like a chore than anything else and although the spell making system and enchantment system is somewhat interesting it doesn't help enough that you won't find yourself dreading running into yet another enemy. The equipment and loot system is fairly detailed but not very well thought out, mostly notably the clothing/armor system is needlessly complicated without that complexity actually adding anything to the game.\n\nThe storyline and dialog is not particularly impressive, not as much because of a lack of quality but because there isn't really enough of it to be judged and what little there is tends to be very generic and not very detailed. The quests should be mentioned as some of the most mind numbing that an RPG can dish up with, the majority being simple fed-ex jobs that challenges only your ability to stay awake.\n\nIn the end, despite every negative thing I've brought up about this game and every negative thing I've forgot to bring up, I still enjoyed it. I enjoyed it simply because the core gameplay mechanic, the exploration, worked. And that is the most important thing for a game to accomplish. It might not be a hall of fame game in my book, but it was still a good play and a game that played to it's strengths.","November 28, 2012","true","523.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

The combat system is terrible. The later games may be simplified, but the combat systems actually work in those games. This is the only real flaw I have with the game. You can defend it all you want, but the combat is terrible, and drags the entire game down, and is one of the few areas the sequels actually did better in.\n2. Difficulty. I like difficulty, but those who like Oblivion and Morrowind spoon-feeding you will hate this game. I think it makes this a real RPG, but some may disagree. However, the difficulty can be annoying, as some enemies can kill you in a single swing, or in twenty swings. It is really inconsistant.\n3. Navigation: As said above, the game does not hold your hand at all. There is no compass, quest markers, or other forms of game help, just your ability to ask questions and follow directions that your character puts in their journal. This once again enriches the RPG elements, but may put off those coming from its sequels.\n4. Oblivion and Skyrim are much easier to play. They are Action-RPG games; this has more RPG elements than its successors. This makes the game seem better for some, but can be a pulling factor to some.\n5. As it’s older, it naturally won't look as nice. The game has aged somewhat fine, but other games have aged more gracefully. The Morrowind Graphics Overhaul mod makes it look great though, leaving you with the now outdated gameplay mechanics.\n6. There is a lot of text to read. If you can't read or follow text directions, ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nOutside of this, the game has far more focus on the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe as well. The land is far more alien than Cyrodiil or Skyrim, and the variety of environments is far wider than what is found in subsequent instalments. The world is therefore far more interesting and engaging than later instalments, and this is the final Elder Scrolls game to not include fast travel (outside of transport services), so like it or not, you will walk, sprint and jump your way across the world.\n\nIf you are ready for the last Elder Scrolls game to focus more on RPG elements than action elements, then I'd recommend. However, if the many broken elements of this game put you off, then don't bother. Morrowind is the last Elder Scrolls game really aimed at a niche market.","July 16, 2014","true","58.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

While Skyrim drew the attention of casuals and babbie's first RPG's, Morrowind has always been a game to respect the player and his choices.

That's your choice, live with the consequences or reload a save. Sold a quest item? Shouldn't have done that, all your fault. It feels more like a game as opposed to a sandbox.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViridianGames/recommended/22320/","ViridianGames","ViridianGames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViridianGames/","284 products in account","TL;DR Review:\nMorrowind is a unique entry in the Elder Scrolls series that is just as fun, engaging and addictive as its big brothers Oblivion and Skyrim, but you will have to work a bit harder to get to the rich nougaty center.\n\nLong Review:\nMorrowind was the first Elder Scrolls game to be released for the Windows platform, and it's clear that Bethesda rewrote the engine from the ground up.  Gone were the problematic, randomly-generated dungeons of Daggerfall.  Now all content would be hand-created, using specialized tools to still allow the massive amounts of content that hallmark an Elder Scrolls game.\n\nThe setting deserves a special mention - it's as far away from your standard generic fantasy setting as possible.  Green gives way to volcanic grey, red and purple.  You fight giant insects, dinosaur-like creatures and steampunk constructs.  Trees give way to cities built under huge mushrooms and massive stone formations.  You travel between cities tucked inside the hollowed-out shell of a giant bug.  It's almost like adventuring in an alien world instead of a fantasy one.\n\nThere is a lot to do.  Over ninety dungeons to raid, four cities and thirteen towns to explore, three noble houses and four guilds to join - each of which has their own questline.  And that's not even touching the main plot, which is arguably the best one ever written for an Elder Scrolls game.\n\nDownsides?  Of course.  There's no fast travel, so you'll initially be doing a lot of walking around.  But between the silt striders (the giant bugs mentioned above), teleportation between mage's guilds, scrolls of intervention and the Mark and Recall spells, you'll eventually be jumping around Morrowind with ease, and it feels more realistic.\n\nThe leveling system isn't quite as broken as the one in Oblivion but it's not as good as Skyrim.  And the progression isn't balanced well - you'll spend a long time feeling like a shmuck and then suddenly you'll be a godling.\n\nAlso, because this version includes both expansion packs, early on in the game you'll be attacked by a fairly difficult enemy.  This fight can be hard for new players, but if you persevere your reward will be an excellent set of light armor that will make the rest of the early game much easier.\n\nI'm not big on mods for Morrowind, but I'd recommend the Morrowind Code Patch, especially if you play a stealthy character because it enables sneak-toggle (by default you have to hold down the sneak button for as long as you're sneaking).  It also does other silly, inconsequential things like fix a ton of crashes and savegame corruptions.  You can learn more about it and get it here:\n\nhttp://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes3Mod:Morrowind_Code_Patch\n\nIf you've never played an Elder Scrolls game, I would strongly suggest you start here.  If you played Oblivion or Skyrim and want more, Morrowind will pay off for you in spades.  I highly recommend it.","December 5, 2013","true","74.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

When I saw it I was blown away that I could be who I wanna be and go where I wanna go. And that was exactly what I got back then when I played it. Im sure I put over 1000 hours into it easily by now.\n\nWell i recently picked this game up again. Added the graphical overhaul 3.0 and its definatelly stunning in comparrison to the original so highly recommend getting that. 100%\n\nWell I definately love Skyrim to death and I think the combat in Oblivion is good but the rest of the game is Ehhh... okay.. i guess. At best.\n\nBut the way the world of Morrowind it self is crafted is like no other open world RPG befor or since. Just the level of love they put into every area and every detail is fantastic. The world it self is what grips me in these type of games and this world is everything but "just slapped together". Its very detailed, it has enough dungeons to explore around every corner and I love that when im exploring I can open a chest and potentially I could find anything. Kinda like Diablo. Loot finding is awesome. Great variaty. Not just the same kinda things over and over like in the other Elder Scrolls games.\n\nCombat may not be for everyone though and I can understand that. Its alittle dull. But if your willing to get used to it you will definately have a good time.\n\nFor me personally even when it comes to playability today this is my favorite Elder Scrolls game. Though I also love Skyrim as well. This is the perfect "in the middle" of the series game, in that i mean, it has the action and feel of the newer ones while keeping it classic RPG like Daggerfall and Arena. Its the perfect middle man.\n\nBut The reason I recomend it most of all is beacuse of the world of Morrowind it self. To me its the best crafted and most lovingly detailed Open World RPG of all time. Its kinda like they relized the possibilitys of creating and open world and they persued it passionately as hell. It is definately a trail blazer game that was built with a passion.\n\n9.7/10","December 15, 2014","true","60.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes it's graphics are dated, and the gameplay can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ if you're only used to newer games, but trust me, Morrowind is amazing. The atmosphere of the game is, in my opinion, almost unrivaled. Small things like the sound of a siltstrider in the distance or the sandstorms blowing through towns completely immerse you in the world of Morrowind. While the story features no real character developement like some newer games (and duh, it's a western RPG they never do anyway) the main narrative is epic, there is no other word for it. Bits and pieces of the story come together slowly and little things fall into place as you do side quests, Morrowind lets you live out one of the best realised fantasy worlds ever, without the irritating limits on choices that are enforced in Skyrim and Oblivion. So seriously, buy this game, and get on to the Elder Scrolls website and get all the free addons.","August 29, 2014","true","206.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In particular, combat and its related skills are a bit unrefined.  For example, you won't be able to hit anything with melee attacks until you raise your melee skill, which is only raised by successfully hitting things.  Luckily, this game was very popular and you can find many mods to get around the aspects of the game that aren't up to modern snuff.\n\nIf you have the time and see what fantasy can be like when it isn't just piggy-backing off of Tolkien, play this game!","September 7, 2014","true","185.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Its almost the polar opposite of titles like Skyrim. Morrowind encourages exploration and flatout tells you to deviate from the main story to become more experienced and come back when you think you're more prepared to progress. There is no fast travel, only Striders which are basically buses. And there are no quest markers. The game instead gives you directions which you then write down in your journal. Personally I had a much better time trying to figure out how to get places based on hints and directions than just walking mindlessly towards a beacon on my map. This game is flawless, a masterpiece. Granted it does take an hour or so to get past the "terrible" graphics. And you may one to get an HD overhaul mod or two. But with the previous set aside, RPG/Adventure games can't get any better than this.\n\nPros:\n-Blinding nastolgia\n-Amazing exploration\n-Beautiful world design\n-Stunning character design\n-Easy to use UI\n-Great story\n\nCons:\n-YOU RUN SOOOO DAMN SLOW!!!\n-Its incredibly hard to do a brute character.

Granted, it still has mechanics and gameplay aspects that are still unique to this day.  Though disregarding its modern day competitors, the environment, story, lore, and immersion of this game still hold up beautifully.  Any fan of The Elder Scrolls series absolutely need to play this game.  It enhances the story and immersion of the newer games in the series considerably (especially the Solstheim DLC in Skyrim.)

I had to have it, I was blown away. I got the PC version as quickly as I could and discovered it had an active and ambitious modding community that at the time I had never even thought was possible and I was hooked even more.\n\nFast forward something like 13 years later and I still love this game. It brings me back to my childhood and the still-active mod community has helped extend its life and helps it keep competing with its younger siblings: Oblivion and Skyrim. While those two games are better in other areas, they never succeeded in recapturing the charm, or sense of boundless adventure and exploration that Morrowind excelled at. It's reflected in the music of each game, Morrowind's theme just fills you with wonder and awe, just as the game world did.\n\nMorrowind is easily one of the best games ever made and it'll keep on living for some time yet. I cannot recommend it enough, though I stress that it not be played in its vanillia, or unaltered, state. At the very least you should install Morrowind Overhaul Sound & Graphics along with it. It has all the essential patches and mods and can set your game up good to go right there. And if certain things like standards set in Oblivion and Skyrim that aren't in Morrowind bother you (such as health/magicka regen or attacks always hitting) there are mods for that as well as ones to help you get around more easily. Just about every "it's not like Oblivion/Skyrim" issue has mod out there to address it. This game's strength is how far its mods can go. Something that Oblivion and Skyrim were never as good at.","June 9, 2015","true","118.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I first played it on the Xbox. When I first saw my brother playing it I thought it was stupid as I seen my brother wandering the world and I always refused to try it. But one day he made me try the game and then I was addicted. When I first played the game I didn’t do any quest I just got a house the good old way by killing its owner in Ald-Ruhn, Gnisis and Khuul. Later on in 2008 I got the game for the PC and made mods that I dreamed of playing. I don’t mod the game anymore but I still play the game and it never gets old. I also play the game for quests now unlike I did when I first played and that the best part of the Elder Scrolls series. Your free to wander, kill, steal, help others, betray, travel by foot, swim, travel by boat or silt strider which is their stagecoaches, it was endless. And If you got bored I always started a new save and it was memories all over again. The two expansion packs Tribunal and Bloodmoon are the best expansions packs I've ever played in any Elder Scrolls game, especially Bloodmoon. It adds a green forest and snowy environment which isn't available in the rest of the game. And the Tribunal expansion only added a city but a big city to the game with a 20 hour main storyline which I thought was impressive and very enjoyable. And the free little add-on DLCs that were made by Bethesda are pretty cool too especially the Seige At Firemoth plug-in. I recommend this game to anyone who hasn’t played an Elder Scrolls game and if you have played an Elder Scrolls game you may want to get mods and high-res textures that make it more like the newer Elder Scrolls game so it doesn’t seem old to you such as the games combat, menus, or graphic. Its an older game and for some gamers its maybe too old for them and not enjoyable.

They do, just not on the same scale.\nAdvancing in a Faction requires you to be proficent in their favored skills, not just doing the quests.\nThere are NO limits to what you can do if you really think about it.\nHave you ever wanted to make a ring or amulet that lets you Levitate forever?

The game is brilliant once completely modded with those two overhauls. But if you really want to play the original version like so many, such as myself, did when it was first released, have at it. ;)\n\nYou won't be disappointed.","May 7","true","80.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Used to have almost every location in the game world memorized because I'd played it so much. Even Skyrim, as good as it is, lacks a few things that Morrowind has. Morrowind doesn't try to hold your hand and ask you how you're feeling. It throws you in the game world and says good luck, buddy. Pretty sure it was because of this game that Bethesda couldn't get over the "start the player as a prisoner" schtick. Someone might want to send Bethesda the news; it wasn't the prisoner thing. It was simply the fact that this was a damn good game.","May 27","true","171.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Everything is different, to the odd fungus flora, to the floating jellyfish that are the Netch. You start as a lowly Outlander, and are constantly told that you, are a worthless outlander. And you don't belong. But as you progress, that will change. You will become an Outlander who barely can swing a sword, to the Nerevarine, legendary Dunmer Saint who can kill gods, and capture their souls.\n\nThe satisfaction of this makes the game very rewarding and fun to play. Not to mention the amazing spell-creation system, that allows you to create any spell imaginable.\n\nNow other than that, let's talk Story. Morrowind tells one of the greatest stories you will ever partake in. The 6th House has risen, and a blight pollutes Vvardenfell. Will you be the one to save Vvardenfell from this blight, and destroy the evil Dagoth Ur, who dwells in Red Mountain? Or who knows, you might just become arch-mage of Great House Telvanni. All of this is up to you.\n\nI definitely recommend Morrowind to anyone who enjoys a good story, a great RPG/openworld game, and a piece of art. But don't let graphics put you off! Morrowind is an amazing, must-play game! Alas, some people may be scaared of these "bad" graphics. That's why there's Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul! It makes the game look like any modern game, so haha, there's no excuses now!","May 6","true","201.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unfortunately though there are a lot of bad ideas/concepts in this game but regardless, I believe it to be the best in the series.\n\nLet's start off with the good things. The story is amazing, the questlines are fun (I haven't even done them all) and Vvardenfell is an amazing, beautiful world with plenty of things to discover. Alchemists and mages will love the amount of customization and potions/spells you can create and the sheer amount of weapons in this game is astounding. This game is extremely open-ended and you can tackle anything you want whenever you want, and this can lead to some funny situations where enemies are way too powerful for you. There also aren't waypoints or quest markers, you have to fill the map out yourself and you HAVE to listen to what people say and use your Journal and your brain overall to figure out where you should go next, or how you should go about doing certain quests (investigations for example.) You're an outsider, and the residents of Vvardenfell make sure you know it. You have no name for yourself when you start off and you have to get on people's good side, you have to earn respect. It's not just given to you like it is in say Skyrim for example where you're held with high regard pretty much right from the start. This game absolutely does NOT hold your hand, there's no "essential NPCs" in this game. You kill someone vital to the main questline? Congratulations, you destroyed the entire questline and cannot continue it unless you have an old save file to load from.\n\nThat being said, this game isn't perfect. Combat isn't fun, it's frustrating since you're "missing" more than you're landing hits. Spells can also "fail" to cast and when in dire situations and desperately need a healing spell this can bite you in the ♥♥♥. There also isn't much voice acting, most of the dialog is text-based and while I personally don't have an issue with it there are some that will think it takes away from the immersion. There also aren't mounts like horses and your character runs pretty slow, even with Speed at 88 it takes a while to get around unless you use console commands to warp to places, or use Silt Striders. The game is pretty buggy too, I fall through the ground every now and then but usually automatically teleport back to where I was. I've had the game crash on me a few times too but that's no big deal.\n\nThe graphics obviously are dated, meaning any PC can run this game. Not joking, my old Compaq desktop from the mid-late 90s could run this game, and that's saying something since the game came out in the early 2000s. You can use mods like Morrowind Overhaul or Morrowind Graphics Extender to make this game look as good as/better than Oblivion but I don't use either of those mods. The only mods I really use are mods that allow beast races to wear boots as well as a mod that improves the quality of the in-game text since this game doesn't support 1080p without modding and without the mod the text is blurry and hard to read.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who likes Elder Scrolls. It's hard to get into at first but once you do every TES game after it will feel incredibly easy and dumbed down.

However if you're any fan of more classic RPG's, you need to give this game a look. Before Oblivion's more medieval landscape (Shivering Isles exheunt) and before Skyrim's Canada, Morrowind built a beautiful fantasy landscape, filled with spectacular creatures, varied characters, dwarven mechanations, and original quests.Technically speaking, the sound and graphics aren't much to speak of (though the music is adventurous, and really ups the experience). There is not much voice acting to speak of in most of this game, instead Bethesda opted for text boxes to save space. However, this opens the door for so much lore, and flavor text (which is important, damnit!) that this feels like the best crafted version of the Elder Scrolls universe.\n\nThe game isn't levelled like it's predecessors, the world stays as it is, and you start out pretty weak. But it pushes you to be strong, and if you put the time in, you can overcome every challenge. There isn't a lot of emphasis on balance, because like a classic RPG, this game doesn't hold your hand. There isn't a compass to help you find quest points, instead you have a journal which subjectively directs you to your quest goal. For example, "The cave is north of Seyda Neen, a bit past the bridge on the river." It feels like a real adventure, going through it.\n\nIf I were to price it: 30-Full price due to the age. But the game now can be found for incredibly cheap, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hard RPG experience.","December 24, 2013","true","8.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I do have to say though this game is very strict with character classes so whatever you choose in the beginning, stick with it or you will have to start over because you ♥♥♥♥ed up your character. If Morrowind is not your cup of tea because of the diceroll system, other gameplay mechanics etc. Then I reccommend Oblivion.

The main story of Morrowind (which is the only real questline in the game without the expansions) is simply many levels above what is presented to us in Oblivion and Skyrim as I see it. Even though the graphics are now very outdated, I still feel the game world in Morrowind feels more "real" than in the two latest games - the reason for this is probably that Morrowind is much more lore-rich and that no matter where you go and what you do you still feel connected with the main plot and the workings of Dunmer society (which you will be intimately familiar with in this game).\n\nMorrowind's greatest asset is probably the sense of wonder and strangeness the game world instills in the player and its very rewarding exploration. Some have called Morrowind "the last real TES game", and while I'm not going to make that claim it is clear that the dumbing down of the series and the extreme hand-holding of the player in say Skyrim has not exactly made the series take a direction that I'm very happy with. In Morrowind you often have to read to discover what to do and where to go at times and at other times you will have to think - there are no quest markers in this game to ruin this part of the game.\n\nMany people complain about the combat in Morrowind, and reasonably so if the game is to be compared to modern action titles - this was never the point however: this game is supposed to be an RPG with many mechanics taken from table-top RPG gaming. Seen in this light the combat system is altogether decent and in my opinion can be quite fun. In vanilla Morrowind for instance you can not manually block with your shield, something that probably sounds ridiculous to modern players - it makes perfect sense though seen from the perspective of old-school RPG-gaming where it is your character's stats and abilities that govern the outcome of an action and not the players own skills of reaction and button-timing and what not.\n\nAll in all I strongly recommend this game and I urge all fans of TES to try it out no matter their feelings about the lack of an action-oriented combat system, because in my opinion this game is simply a better RPG experience than we get in Oblivion or Skyrim. A far better one. Oblivion and Skyrim are games I will probably never play again (been there done that...), but Morrowind I will return to again and again.","July 5, 2014","true","319.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The beautiful world of Morrowind set in Vvardenfell in the third era is breathtaking, with vibrant and exciting places wherever you go, instead of the same Nord settings copied and pasted multiple times.

I recently found Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim on sale with all downloadable content/expansions for cheap here on Steam, so I bought them. I loved the sheer variety of the paths you could travel and guilds/factions you could join. You could enchant your clothing/armor and weapons with magical effects, pick locks, cast awesome destructive abilities, heal, affect your enviroment, etc. I liked the fact you had 10 major/minor skills that leveled you up, but I hated the level 50ish limit on your levels. In order to maximize your stat bonuses you needed to micromanage your skill growth to an absurd level in order to achieve the 100 stats.  Also, after you do the available faction quests (again, you can't join but ONE of the three Great Houses, which does make some sense, but you can join opposing factions, such as the thieves guild, and the imperial legion, or the morag tong, which is almost the same boat.) and the Great House of your choice and the expansions, you can roam the lands to find random quests from people along the roadways.\n\nOverall grade: 9.8/10","September 3, 2014","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is crafted for fans of role-playing games, not casual minded gamers.\n\nWho should buy this game? Fans intreged by the idea of a game that doesn't hold your hands. Fans of older RPGs. Fans who love depth, lore and replayablility.\n\nWho shouldn't buy this game? People who do not like RPGs, who REQUIRE modern "babby" mechanics like quick travel and regenerating health.

The combat system is incredibly complex and has nothing to do with dice rolling at all. (fine it has a little to do with dice rolling but not like a board game) There are so many variables used in one swipe of your sword u cant even count. You have to account for the length of the weapon, how long the weapon, if it hits the enemies hit box, how much strength u have and how long u hold down the mouse button. Is your level with the weapon type in question somewhat high. What is your lvl with the type of weapon. All these things with a press of a button and u dare to call it some simple dice roll. This by far is a great game. Its story is rich and fulfilling unlike oblivions stupid press this enter this clear this find this storyline. There is so many items u can find ull never get bored.

It is not for picky, complaining adults who point every little fault out and refuse to enjoy games for what they are. Morrowind is for hardcore RPG players, the people who can just get lost in the world for days at a time wanting to find every city and do every quest. It's for those of us who can sit down, start up the game, and find our way through with no in-game quest markers at all, instead using strategy, creativity, and logic. And above all, Morrowind is for true Elder Scrolls fans, with history books scattered around the world and a story that ingeniously weaves it's way deep into the past and present of the Elder Scrolls timeline. Overall, if you are a hack and slash fan of Skyrim and not the whole franchise, who will pick apart a game just to find something to complain about, this game is not for you, so don't buy it. Period.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bassospades/recommended/22320/","bassospades","Bassospades","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bassospades/","191 products in account","Morrowind is quite possibly my favorite game of all time. Don't let the number of hours played on my profile fool you; when I had this for the Xbox, my main save alone was probably at least 200 hours. Morrowind was my introduction to the Elder Scrolls series, and as such it holds a special place in my heart. Anyone who is a fan of RPG's and hasn't played this game yet should do so immediately. The gameplay is solid, the plot is rich and engrossing, and the world is enormous and almost alien in the way that it looks nothing like what you would expect a fantasy world to look like. Really, that itself is the beauty of the Elder Scrolls games. Bethesda has created a world which draws on the typical fantasy ideas, and then turns them on their heads to create an atmosphere which is completely unique. Where else would you find cannibalistic wood elves, dwarves who aren't really dwarves, or bipedal lizards who worship a race of magical, sentient trees? Only in The Elder Scrolls.\n\nA word of warning, though: for anyone who is used to the gameplay in Oblivion/Skyrim, you may be in for a rude awakening. While the newer Elder Scrolls games have become more "streamlined" and "action-y," Morrowind is an RPG in the truest sense of the word. The most noticeable difference is in the way combat works. In Oblivion/Skyrim, you stand in front of someone, swing your sword, and hit them. In Morrowind, you could be right in front of an enemy and completely miss. This is because Morrowind uses the old-school dice-rolling mechaninc to determine if your attacks are successful or not. Even your spells can fail to cast if you're not proficient enough in that particular school of magic. No, it's not lag. No, the hitboxes are not broken. That's just the way a real RPG works. Things like this can be frustrating to newer players who aren't used to it, which is completely understandable. But for those who persevere and get past this learning curve, you will be treated to one of the most rewarding and memorable gaming experiences ever. You won't be disappointed.","December 22, 2013","true","49.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

I cannot yet speak for any of the earlier games (as I haven't played them), but Morrowind really is the best TES game I've played. I started with Skyrim and worked my way back. It isn't just nostalgia bias talking when people say Morrowind is amazing; it truly is a culmination of very hard work and insane attention to detail. It rewards you and doesn't insult your intelligence by putting the solutions to puzzles on the wall *cough* Skyrim *cough*. Everything you do, from joining the Temple to fulfilling the prophecy of the Nerevarine, has a noticeable impact on the world. People react to your actions; Bethesda nails this quite well. Whether you're going out to kill Mudcrabs that dragged off a Guar from some random lady's farm in the wilderness or playing politics to manipulate the ebony trade in your house's favor, every moment of Morrowind is rewarding. But that's also the beauty of it: It doesn't force you into anything. Nothing just screams out at you. You have to put the work in to enjoy the game. And once you do, the world and its story slowly unfolds before your eyes. There are so many moments in Morrowind that grabbed me and opened my eyes on a new range of perspectives that there's absolutely no way I could ever hope to count them. Don't let anyone lie to you; this game is incredibly frustrating and difficult at times, but the reward for working through it is one of the best gamplay experiences of all time. My only hope is that Bethesda will make a game as well-crafted, clever, and gripping as Morrowind again some day.","December 25, 2014","true","313.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat system is incredibly complex and has nothing to do with dice rolling at all. (fine it has a little to do with dice rolling but not like a board game) There are so many variables used in one swipe of your sword u cant even count. You have to account for the length of the weapon, how long the weapon, if it hits the enemies hit box, how much strength u have and how long u hold down the mouse button. Is your level with the weapon type in question somewhat high. What is your lvl with the type of weapon. All these things with a press of a button and u dare to call it some simple dice roll.

Before Skyrim ever came out, just about when Oblivion was released, I met this game and fell head over heels in love.  And I freely admit that this is my favourite of the franchise. Why?\n\nYes, it has lesser graphics than the others (cut-scenes in Skyrim are gorgeous, no lie).  But the story. Oh so immersive, like a visual book. It draws you in, giving you reason to learn more, wanting to see what's just around the corner. And no matter how many times I replay it, I still find myself entranced.\n\nSo for those curious about this game, if it's still worth getting? Yes. I've had it in the past on other systems, rebought it on Steam to continue to get lost in this world, and would buy it again and again.","June 16, 2015","true","59.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I understand many people love Oblivion, or Skyrim. For many that's because its the series they came into the Elder Scrolls on, and I can understand that. For me though, I've seen the game-play simplified and degraded from Morrowind, to Oblivion, and to Skyrim. While Skyrim went back to its Morrowind Roots a little more, it was still extremely simplified. Health, Mana, Energy for your stats.. that's it?...\n\nMorrowind is a testament to itself, as even in 2016 its a widely loved, played, and even modded game to this day. It has all the old school gameplay which gamers should love in an RPG. Extensive and in depth stats, deep and meaningful gameplay, immersive quests, situations, and world. Thousands upon thousands of hidden little side stories, quests, and situations in the world you could easily over look if you weren't paying attention. For every minute you immersive yourself in this game, you'll get that back ten fold in enjoyment. This game truly is a true open world in terms of being able to play how you want, when you want, where you want, and being able to make your character be who you want them to be with virtually no limitations.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Character and your Stats\n\nYour character in Morrowind has very deep and meaningful stats. Unlike Oblivoin and Skyrim, each weapon type, Armor Type, etc. (and there's more than Oblivion or Skyrim), has its own stat tied to it.\n\nCharacter Skills: Heavy Armor, Medium Armor, Spear, Acrobatics, Armorer, Axe, Blunt Weapon, Long Blades, Block, Light Armor, Marksman, Sneak Athletics, Hand to Hand, Short Blade, Unarmored, Illusion, Mercantile, Speechcraft, Alchemy, Conjuration, Enchant, SEcurity, Alteration, Destruction, Mysticism, Restoration\n\nCharacter Stats: Agility, Endurance, Intelligence, Luck, Personality, Speed, Strength, Willpower, Health, Magicka, Fatigue, Encumberance, etc.\n\nThese skills and stats allow you to truly make a character be exactly who you want them to be however. Want to make a real berserker that actually acts like one? Major Skill into Axes, Unarmored, Light Armor, Speed, with Minors being Block, Armorer, etc. Run around in almost no armor wielding axes.\n\nMake a mage that feels like a real mage, with Unarmored, and the vast variety of magic skills and spells. The coolest thing about MOrrowind is you can make spells that never existed easily within the game. I'll go into that more.\n\nExploration, Quests, and the World - It's open ended\n\nAs this section says, it really is open ended. There are nearly 500 quests in Morrowind with its expansions. (I believe the exact number is 490ish give or take a few), and most of these are open ended quests.\n\n"But wait, what does that mean?" It's a situation which you rarely ever see in games anymore, and this includes Oblivion and Skyrim. These quests let you play your character how you want to play them. There are logical and realistic ways to beat quests in this game, and many many of them let you do it how your character most likely would.\n\nExample: One quest for a guild which you can join asks you to go and get a land deed from an old lady. Simple quest right? If it was in oblivion or Skyrim you'd go talk to her, maybe do a side quest she asks you to do, quest done, and move on. Right? Well not in Morrowind. In Morrowind 99% of every quest item is already in the game, somewhere. Just waiting to be found. There is none of this magickal "Oh you want this for this quest? let me conjure this key or item I want you to take or that you need out of thin air". If they have it, they have it on their person, or somewhere nearby.\n\nYou can complete this 1 simple quest by either doing a side quest for her, which asks you to go find her lost love who disappeared in a cave (this actually opens up several MORE alternative ways to finish the quest), Obvious choice if you're RPing as an adventurer, you can kill her resulting in you not needing the land deed as she's now dead, a good choice you could do as an assassin character,  you can steal the land deed from her chest in her house if you're RPing as a thief, or if your character is more of a merchant, trader with good speechcraft, you can go to the main city of Vivec, go to the government offices there, talk to a head dude, and get a forged document of the land deed while pushing a few coins under the desk in a shady manner.\n\nThis is just 1 simple quest, and there are nearly 500 of them, many of them open ended in ways  such as this. Most of these alternative ways are not straight forward, the quest will not say "you can do this, or this or this". You gotta figure it out on your own, but  most do have alternative ways that are not always apparently obvious.\n\nAs you're exploring you may run across a quest item without even realizing it. I remember years ago exploring a cave, finding a nice weapon, and selling it. Several days later I got a quest to go find a lost sword in the same cave. After exploring the cave I realized the sword that I needed from the quest I just got, I had sold to a merchant days ago...\n\nThis now created an open ended situation in the game I created myself. Now I have new options. Buy the sword back, pick pocket it off of the merchant, or kill the merchant, and steal everything. Or I cound abandon the quest, and just say, nope, none of those things are workable, I'll just say sorry dude can't get your sword, I sold it!"\n\nMy biggest complaint with Oblivion is after you've gone into a few caves or ruins they all just started feeling the same, it didn't feel "lived in", and the area's didn't have much of a soul or atmosphere to them. The ruins and caves felt like an obstacle course, or stage. Not real. Skyrim fixed this for the most part, but to me still didn't entirely capture how Morrowind is.\n\nIn Morrowind the exploration is top notch. So many little things hidden in nooks and crannies. Or things that go along with immersing yourself in the world. Go into a random house in a random town, and talk to an NPC, word is there is unhappiness with one of the families, talk to the wife and she says she isn't happy, and wants to deal with the problem. Ok simple right? Nothing here to immerse yourself with, or at least thats how it'd be in Skyrim and Oblivion, Just some more back story to spam through and take no interest in. However in Morrowind, usually there's something more... if you sneak around the house, and lift up one of the pillows you'll find a dagger underneath...\n\nPerhaps she plans to kill her husband one night while he's asleep? Who knows... But its those tiny little hidden touches that really makes the world feel alive.. Even if the characters don't ever actually move. (Except for the guards)\n\nI literally ran out of room typing this, so excuse me if this last part is extremely rushed. I could go on for days about how awesome Morrowind is.\n\nThis game has tons more armors, weapons than Oblivion and Skyrim Combined, The magic itself is something which mage lovers have been suffering tremendously in both Oblivion and SKyrim, but is soooo open ended in Morrowind.\n\nYou can create spells that do not exist stock. High level mages, with a good amount of gold can create epically powerful spells and name them themselves. Want a Spell that binds all enemies hit in an AOE, that strikes lightning down, sets them on fire, and freezes them, while also blinding them? You can!.. Well.. that will cost a ton, but you can do it. There are vast majority of spells in this game that do not exist in Morrowind or Oblivion.\n\nAs I said, I only wrote about 20% what I meant too.. I ran out of room. If you're interested in Morrowind look at this page: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Morrowind Everything you could ever want to know of how things work. The amount of content Morrowind has...\n\n\n\n","February 12","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a rich and complex lore. There are lots of quirky characters and some downright silly side quests. There is a sense of epic scale, both in geography and story. The two expansion packs offered solid additional adventures for the protagonist. You can be just about anyone and do just about anything. Graphics are dated but easily spruced up with mods--and there is of course a robust modding community still out there. Dealing with even simple encounters in the early few levels can be frustratingly difficult (especially given the percent chance to hit based on skill level, so even point-blank perfectly aimed attacks often miss), and if you have adequately leveled your character then the very end-game content can really reduce the game to a pattern of repeated clicking to kill things, barring a few overpowered encounters (rather disappointing, as it really makes obvious that so much of the way the player interacts with the game is through violence); besides these points, though, I would describe the game as nearly flawless (if it wasn't infamously and maybe even fondly known for a bevy of bugs). I would highly recommend, whether you've played any Elder Scrolls games or not.

It is not for picky, complaining adults who point every little fault out and refuse to enjoy games for what they are. Morrowind is for hardcore RPG players, the people who can just get lost in the world for days at a time wanting to find every city and do every quest. It's for those of us who can sit down, start up the game, and find our way through with no in-game quest markers at all, instead using strategy, creativity, and logic. And above all, Morrowind is for true Elder Scrolls fans, with history books scattered around the world and a story that ingeniously weaves it's way deep into the past and present of the Elder Scrolls timeline. Overall, if you are a hack and slash fan of Skyrim and not the whole franchise, who will pick apart a game just to find something to complain about, this game is not for you, so don't buy it. Period.

It is a very different game. I am not going to spend the entirety of this review telling you it's better than Skyrim and that you have to agree with me. You're a modern TES fan and want to play Morrowind? Hmm. I'm not going to tell you to go back to Skyrim, as I haven't played it personally and my entire view of the game is based on what I hear from friends and YouTube. Here's the problem with playing Morrowind: It takes AGES to actually get into the game and start enjoying it. Character creation takes ages and needs to be thought out. Also, the combat system. Most people will tell you that the combat system is dated and terrible. While the former may be true, the latter certainly isn't. Once you're a few levels up, combat becomes more mindless. Your character will have tons of stats and skills, all of which have an effect on one or more gameplay elements. Combat is based on dice rolls. Whenever you swing your sword at an enemy, there is an initial dice roll. This dice rolls is affected by your many skills and other stats. I'm not going to ramble about starting out and what you should do, but I'll leave a link to my favourite guide at the end of this review. Once you have done some of the main quest, levelled up a load, and know how to succeed in combat you can start exploring and side questing. This, in my opinion, is the best part of Morrowind. Join the mages guild and learn how to make your own potions that you can sell for a profit. learn to enchant and make a cloak of invisibility. Make a ring that allows you to fly whenever you wear it. Boots that let you run at ridiculous speed. None of these are pre-programmed items, you can make them yourself. Maybe you'd like to join the Morag Tong, a shady underground association of assassins. You could literally just wander the lands of Vvardenfell and look for adventure. Morrowind has an excellent main quest, but it excels at letting you do whatever you like. Two expansions have been released, which increase the length of the game. Tribunal lets you visit the capital of Morrowind, Mournhold, which in itself excites me. Bloodmoon adds in the small frozen island of Solstheim, also seen in Dragonborn. These are both included in the Steam version. The game looks VERY dated, but this is easily fixed by the MGSO mod, which imporves graphics and installs tons of other patches to combat bugs. I recommend downloading it even if you're on a low end PC or a laptop and just turning off the really demanding stuff. Tamriel Rebuilt is a community made expansion that increases the size of the world map and is also highly recommended.\n\n\nThis is now very much a rant, so I'm going to end off here.\n\nTL;DR\nThe Elder Scrolls III is extremely hard to get into, but also extremely worth it. The insane amount of freedom given to you is more than worth the first few hours spent missing attacks on mudcrabs. At the time of writing, I am exactly 100 hours into Morrowind. I have done less than half of the main quest. Don't be fooled, you don't have to spend hundreds of hours trying to beat this game. You could probably clear it in less than 50. But if you want to spend hours on end adventuring, questing and exploring, this game allows you to do that too. It has it's flaws, but those can easily be fixed by the power of mods or outright ignored.\n\n17/10 would lose all my friends and CHIM again.\n\n\n(You may have noticed that this  rant  is rather similar to SorcerorDave's 'Why You Should Still Play Morrowind in 2014' video.

The game brings the province of Morrowind, more specifically the island of Vvardenfell, to life. Its an unforgetfull experiance just wandering through one of the more "interesting" regions of Tamriel. This game is one of the finest examples of an RPG in the early 2000s and it amazes me how much lore and intrigue Bethesda put into this game, it's great just going up to an NPC and just hearing their backstory.\n\nThe Dungeons were also great with some unforgetfull puzzles along with the interesting architecture that surrounds almost every building in Vvardenfell. RPG elements too are all present which any RPG fan will appreciate though it could be jarring to someone who started on Skyrim which seems to throw most of the elements out the window.\n\nSometimes I have a hard time deciding whether Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind or Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall is my favourite in the series but you can't be wrong either way, this game is a fantastic entry in the series, every Elder Scrolls & RPG fan needs to play this game.\n\n100% recommended.","March 30, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a rich and complex lore. There are lots of quirky characters and some downright silly side quests. There is a sense of epic scale, both in geography and story. The two expansion packs offered solid additional adventures for the protagonist. You can be just about anyone and do just about anything. Graphics are dated but easily spruced up with mods--and there is of course a robust modding community still out there. Dealing with even simple encounters in the early few levels can be frustratingly difficult (especially given the percent chance to hit based on skill level, so even point-blank perfectly aimed attacks often miss), and if you have adequately leveled your character then the very end-game content can really reduce the game to a pattern of repeated clicking to kill things, barring a few overpowered encounters (rather disappointing, as it really makes obvious that so much of the way the player interacts with the game is through violence); besides these points, though, I would describe the game as nearly flawless (if it wasn't infamously and maybe even fondly known for a bevy of bugs). I would highly recommend, whether you've played any Elder Scrolls games or not.

I understand many people love Oblivion, or Skyrim. For many that's because its the series they came into the Elder Scrolls on, and I can understand that. For me though, I've seen the game-play simplified and degraded from Morrowind, to Oblivion, and to Skyrim. While Skyrim went back to its Morrowind Roots a little more, it was still extremely simplified. Health, Mana, Energy for your stats.. that's it?...\n\nMorrowind is a testament to itself, as even in 2016 its a widely loved, played, and even modded game to this day. It has all the old school gameplay which gamers should love in an RPG. Extensive and in depth stats, deep and meaningful gameplay, immersive quests, situations, and world. Thousands upon thousands of hidden little side stories, quests, and situations in the world you could easily over look if you weren't paying attention. For every minute you immersive yourself in this game, you'll get that back ten fold in enjoyment. This game truly is a true open world in terms of being able to play how you want, when you want, where you want, and being able to make your character be who you want them to be with virtually no limitations.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Character and your Stats\n\nYour character in Morrowind has very deep and meaningful stats. Unlike Oblivoin and Skyrim, each weapon type, Armor Type, etc. (and there's more than Oblivion or Skyrim), has its own stat tied to it.\n\nCharacter Skills: Heavy Armor, Medium Armor, Spear, Acrobatics, Armorer, Axe, Blunt Weapon, Long Blades, Block, Light Armor, Marksman, Sneak Athletics, Hand to Hand, Short Blade, Unarmored, Illusion, Mercantile, Speechcraft, Alchemy, Conjuration, Enchant, SEcurity, Alteration, Destruction, Mysticism, Restoration\n\nCharacter Stats: Agility, Endurance, Intelligence, Luck, Personality, Speed, Strength, Willpower, Health, Magicka, Fatigue, Encumberance, etc.\n\nThese skills and stats allow you to truly make a character be exactly who you want them to be however. Want to make a real berserker that actually acts like one? Major Skill into Axes, Unarmored, Light Armor, Speed, with Minors being Block, Armorer, etc. Run around in almost no armor wielding axes.\n\nMake a mage that feels like a real mage, with Unarmored, and the vast variety of magic skills and spells. The coolest thing about MOrrowind is you can make spells that never existed easily within the game. I'll go into that more.\n\nExploration, Quests, and the World - It's open ended\n\nAs this section says, it really is open ended. There are nearly 500 quests in Morrowind with its expansions. (I believe the exact number is 490ish give or take a few), and most of these are open ended quests.\n\n"But wait, what does that mean?" It's a situation which you rarely ever see in games anymore, and this includes Oblivion and Skyrim. These quests let you play your character how you want to play them. There are logical and realistic ways to beat quests in this game, and many many of them let you do it how your character most likely would.\n\nExample: One quest for a guild which you can join asks you to go and get a land deed from an old lady. Simple quest right? If it was in oblivion or Skyrim you'd go talk to her, maybe do a side quest she asks you to do, quest done, and move on. Right? Well not in Morrowind. In Morrowind 99% of every quest item is already in the game, somewhere. Just waiting to be found. There is none of this magickal "Oh you want this for this quest? let me conjure this key or item I want you to take or that you need out of thin air". If they have it, they have it on their person, or somewhere nearby.\n\nYou can complete this 1 simple quest by either doing a side quest for her, which asks you to go find her lost love who disappeared in a cave (this actually opens up several MORE alternative ways to finish the quest), Obvious choice if you're RPing as an adventurer, you can kill her resulting in you not needing the land deed as she's now dead, a good choice you could do as an assassin character,  you can steal the land deed from her chest in her house if you're RPing as a thief, or if your character is more of a merchant, trader with good speechcraft, you can go to the main city of Vivec, go to the government offices there, talk to a head dude, and get a forged document of the land deed while pushing a few coins under the desk in a shady manner.\n\nThis is just 1 simple quest, and there are nearly 500 of them, many of them open ended in ways  such as this. Most of these alternative ways are not straight forward, the quest will not say "you can do this, or this or this". You gotta figure it out on your own, but  most do have alternative ways that are not always apparently obvious.\n\nAs you're exploring you may run across a quest item without even realizing it. I remember years ago exploring a cave, finding a nice weapon, and selling it. Several days later I got a quest to go find a lost sword in the same cave. After exploring the cave I realized the sword that I needed from the quest I just got, I had sold to a merchant days ago...\n\nThis now created an open ended situation in the game I created myself. Now I have new options. Buy the sword back, pick pocket it off of the merchant, or kill the merchant, and steal everything. Or I cound abandon the quest, and just say, nope, none of those things are workable, I'll just say sorry dude can't get your sword, I sold it!"\n\nMy biggest complaint with Oblivion is after you've gone into a few caves or ruins they all just started feeling the same, it didn't feel "lived in", and the area's didn't have much of a soul or atmosphere to them. The ruins and caves felt like an obstacle course, or stage. Not real. Skyrim fixed this for the most part, but to me still didn't entirely capture how Morrowind is.\n\nIn Morrowind the exploration is top notch. So many little things hidden in nooks and crannies. Or things that go along with immersing yourself in the world. Go into a random house in a random town, and talk to an NPC, word is there is unhappiness with one of the families, talk to the wife and she says she isn't happy, and wants to deal with the problem. Ok simple right? Nothing here to immerse yourself with, or at least thats how it'd be in Skyrim and Oblivion, Just some more back story to spam through and take no interest in. However in Morrowind, usually there's something more... if you sneak around the house, and lift up one of the pillows you'll find a dagger underneath...\n\nPerhaps she plans to kill her husband one night while he's asleep? Who knows... But its those tiny little hidden touches that really makes the world feel alive.. Even if the characters don't ever actually move. (Except for the guards)\n\nI literally ran out of room typing this, so excuse me if this last part is extremely rushed. I could go on for days about how awesome Morrowind is.\n\nThis game has tons more armors, weapons than Oblivion and Skyrim Combined, The magic itself is something which mage lovers have been suffering tremendously in both Oblivion and SKyrim, but is soooo open ended in Morrowind.\n\nYou can create spells that do not exist stock. High level mages, with a good amount of gold can create epically powerful spells and name them themselves. Want a Spell that binds all enemies hit in an AOE, that strikes lightning down, sets them on fire, and freezes them, while also blinding them? You can!.. Well.. that will cost a ton, but you can do it. There are vast majority of spells in this game that do not exist in Morrowind or Oblivion.\n\nAs I said, I only wrote about 20% what I meant too.. I ran out of room. If you're interested in Morrowind look at this page: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Morrowind Everything you could ever want to know of how things work. The amount of content Morrowind has...\n\n\n\n","February 12","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The lack of way-points gives you a reason to read every bit of text to find out where you're going to be headed and makes this game very engaging. The combat system led me to stop playing the game for about a week until I looked it up and found out that you had to be skilled in the weapon you were using and that enemies could dodge. Also I learned that you should sell items to earn money when you're starting off. Those made me be able to enjoy the game. So far at the time of this review I have 5 hours and I haven't gotten anywhere in the quests so I can expect this game to be a very long game. This game has aged very well for being 13 years old.

I understand many people love Oblivion, or Skyrim. For many that's because its the series they came into the Elder Scrolls on, and I can understand that. For me though, I've seen the game-play simplified and degraded from Morrowind, to Oblivion, and to Skyrim. While Skyrim went back to its Morrowind Roots a little more, it was still extremely simplified. Health, Mana, Energy for your stats.. that's it?...\n\nMorrowind is a testament to itself, as even in 2016 its a widely loved, played, and even modded game to this day. It has all the old school gameplay which gamers should love in an RPG. Extensive and in depth stats, deep and meaningful gameplay, immersive quests, situations, and world. Thousands upon thousands of hidden little side stories, quests, and situations in the world you could easily over look if you weren't paying attention. For every minute you immersive yourself in this game, you'll get that back ten fold in enjoyment. This game truly is a true open world in terms of being able to play how you want, when you want, where you want, and being able to make your character be who you want them to be with virtually no limitations.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Character and your Stats\n\nYour character in Morrowind has very deep and meaningful stats. Unlike Oblivoin and Skyrim, each weapon type, Armor Type, etc. (and there's more than Oblivion or Skyrim), has its own stat tied to it.\n\nCharacter Skills: Heavy Armor, Medium Armor, Spear, Acrobatics, Armorer, Axe, Blunt Weapon, Long Blades, Block, Light Armor, Marksman, Sneak Athletics, Hand to Hand, Short Blade, Unarmored, Illusion, Mercantile, Speechcraft, Alchemy, Conjuration, Enchant, SEcurity, Alteration, Destruction, Mysticism, Restoration\n\nCharacter Stats: Agility, Endurance, Intelligence, Luck, Personality, Speed, Strength, Willpower, Health, Magicka, Fatigue, Encumberance, etc.\n\nThese skills and stats allow you to truly make a character be exactly who you want them to be however. Want to make a real berserker that actually acts like one? Major Skill into Axes, Unarmored, Light Armor, Speed, with Minors being Block, Armorer, etc. Run around in almost no armor wielding axes.\n\nMake a mage that feels like a real mage, with Unarmored, and the vast variety of magic skills and spells. The coolest thing about MOrrowind is you can make spells that never existed easily within the game. I'll go into that more.\n\nExploration, Quests, and the World - It's open ended\n\nAs this section says, it really is open ended. There are nearly 500 quests in Morrowind with its expansions. (I believe the exact number is 490ish give or take a few), and most of these are open ended quests.\n\n"But wait, what does that mean?" It's a situation which you rarely ever see in games anymore, and this includes Oblivion and Skyrim. These quests let you play your character how you want to play them. There are logical and realistic ways to beat quests in this game, and many many of them let you do it how your character most likely would.\n\nExample: One quest for a guild which you can join asks you to go and get a land deed from an old lady. Simple quest right? If it was in oblivion or Skyrim you'd go talk to her, maybe do a side quest she asks you to do, quest done, and move on. Right? Well not in Morrowind. In Morrowind 99% of every quest item is already in the game, somewhere. Just waiting to be found. There is none of this magickal "Oh you want this for this quest? let me conjure this key or item I want you to take or that you need out of thin air". If they have it, they have it on their person, or somewhere nearby.\n\nYou can complete this 1 simple quest by either doing a side quest for her, which asks you to go find her lost love who disappeared in a cave (this actually opens up several MORE alternative ways to finish the quest), Obvious choice if you're RPing as an adventurer, you can kill her resulting in you not needing the land deed as she's now dead, a good choice you could do as an assassin character,  you can steal the land deed from her chest in her house if you're RPing as a thief, or if your character is more of a merchant, trader with good speechcraft, you can go to the main city of Vivec, go to the government offices there, talk to a head dude, and get a forged document of the land deed while pushing a few coins under the desk in a shady manner.\n\nThis is just 1 simple quest, and there are nearly 500 of them, many of them open ended in ways  such as this. Most of these alternative ways are not straight forward, the quest will not say "you can do this, or this or this". You gotta figure it out on your own, but  most do have alternative ways that are not always apparently obvious.\n\nAs you're exploring you may run across a quest item without even realizing it. I remember years ago exploring a cave, finding a nice weapon, and selling it. Several days later I got a quest to go find a lost sword in the same cave. After exploring the cave I realized the sword that I needed from the quest I just got, I had sold to a merchant days ago...\n\nThis now created an open ended situation in the game I created myself. Now I have new options. Buy the sword back, pick pocket it off of the merchant, or kill the merchant, and steal everything. Or I cound abandon the quest, and just say, nope, none of those things are workable, I'll just say sorry dude can't get your sword, I sold it!"\n\nMy biggest complaint with Oblivion is after you've gone into a few caves or ruins they all just started feeling the same, it didn't feel "lived in", and the area's didn't have much of a soul or atmosphere to them. The ruins and caves felt like an obstacle course, or stage. Not real. Skyrim fixed this for the most part, but to me still didn't entirely capture how Morrowind is.\n\nIn Morrowind the exploration is top notch. So many little things hidden in nooks and crannies. Or things that go along with immersing yourself in the world. Go into a random house in a random town, and talk to an NPC, word is there is unhappiness with one of the families, talk to the wife and she says she isn't happy, and wants to deal with the problem. Ok simple right? Nothing here to immerse yourself with, or at least thats how it'd be in Skyrim and Oblivion, Just some more back story to spam through and take no interest in. However in Morrowind, usually there's something more... if you sneak around the house, and lift up one of the pillows you'll find a dagger underneath...\n\nPerhaps she plans to kill her husband one night while he's asleep? Who knows... But its those tiny little hidden touches that really makes the world feel alive.. Even if the characters don't ever actually move. (Except for the guards)\n\nI literally ran out of room typing this, so excuse me if this last part is extremely rushed. I could go on for days about how awesome Morrowind is.\n\nThis game has tons more armors, weapons than Oblivion and Skyrim Combined, The magic itself is something which mage lovers have been suffering tremendously in both Oblivion and SKyrim, but is soooo open ended in Morrowind.\n\nYou can create spells that do not exist stock. High level mages, with a good amount of gold can create epically powerful spells and name them themselves. Want a Spell that binds all enemies hit in an AOE, that strikes lightning down, sets them on fire, and freezes them, while also blinding them? You can!.. Well.. that will cost a ton, but you can do it. There are vast majority of spells in this game that do not exist in Morrowind or Oblivion.\n\nAs I said, I only wrote about 20% what I meant too.. I ran out of room. If you're interested in Morrowind look at this page: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Morrowind Everything you could ever want to know of how things work. The amount of content Morrowind has...\n\n\n\n","February 12","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a rich and complex lore. There are lots of quirky characters and some downright silly side quests. There is a sense of epic scale, both in geography and story. The two expansion packs offered solid additional adventures for the protagonist. You can be just about anyone and do just about anything. Graphics are dated but easily spruced up with mods--and there is of course a robust modding community still out there. Dealing with even simple encounters in the early few levels can be frustratingly difficult (especially given the percent chance to hit based on skill level, so even point-blank perfectly aimed attacks often miss), and if you have adequately leveled your character then the very end-game content can really reduce the game to a pattern of repeated clicking to kill things, barring a few overpowered encounters (rather disappointing, as it really makes obvious that so much of the way the player interacts with the game is through violence); besides these points, though, I would describe the game as nearly flawless (if it wasn't infamously and maybe even fondly known for a bevy of bugs). I would highly recommend, whether you've played any Elder Scrolls games or not.

In order to progress through the game you have to read through your journal in order to get directions for people you need to find.

That game is good and I did have fun. BUT it is too much work and dedication for me personally to play through. Call me a casual but I like how the newest elder scrolls tell you where to go and makes it fairly easy.\n\nIf you do decide to play this game I recommend adding some mods.\nThere are many quality of life mods for this game that doesn't change the overall feel of the game but simply make it a better gameplay experience. Updated graphics being one of the best.\n\nTL;DR: I do recommend this game if you have the time and dedication for it.

It completely blew my mind, I was hooked. I have no idea how many hundreds of hours I played in on the original XBOX, later on my XBOX 360, and later still on the computer before even learning what Steam was, and now you can see I have over 80 hours clocked. There will always be a place in this gamer's heart for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.\n\nThat being said, if I might take off my nostalgia goggles for a moment... visually... it has not aged well. There's a mod for that however, which makes it gorgeous. The only other real drawback of it is the combat system which I really don't mind. Essentially you can level up a skill to 100, and the lowest a skill starts at is 5. That is basically the percentage chance of hitting. You could be fighting a Kwama worm thing that has a disease which renders it  immobile (I assume something that decreases its already pitiful strength), and you will have a VERY hard time hitting it if your skill is only 5-15. *MISS* *MISS* *MISS* *MISS* *HIT* *MISS* *MISS*, etc. Same goes with spells, except it's your chance of casting it. The bright side is however, each race has specific things they're good at, and you can select traits Major skills which are basically what you're really good at, and Minor skills which is what you're somewhat good at.\n\nMajor skills get a boost of something like 25-30 points as I recall, while Minor ones get around 15 or so I think. There are also teachers all over Morrowind who can teach you various skills, and the lower level you are, the cheaper it is. So if you want to level up something that's only at 5-15, then do some training with a professional first. Get it up to a solid 25 or so at least before training on real enemies.\n\nOne fascinating thing about this game however is when everything loads, that's how your world is. If you know where to look, you can get some SERIOUSLY good weapons/armour, though if you end up in the wrong place at too low a level, you can get SERIOUSLY messed up by a powerful enemy. Morrowind is quite unforgiving, but if you have the patience to get to know it well, it's very much worth the effort. There are many mods available that can help clean up the visuals, and who knows, there might be some which changes it so that you ALWAYS hit but the damage done is dependant on level, like Oblivion. Though as stated, personally, I don't mind the hit/miss system. The first character you make will just be a test run, I imagine. Getting a feel for the game, trying new things. If you've played Oblivion and/or Skyrim though, and already know all the skills, then that'll give you a great head start.\n\nUltimately, if you don't mind lacking graphics and somewhat clunky combat systems (if you use skills you're not good at though; if you select your race/skills properly, you'll start with level 35-50 with your primary skills, then the combat is more fluid), then I can't recommend this game enough. If you DO mind lacking graphics but don't mind somewhat clunky combat systems, then I still recommend it if you know how to mod. If you mind both, do some research, see if you can mod it so that the combat system is more like Oblivion/Skyrim, and if so, have at it. This game is truly a gem. I believe it has less land than Oblivion or Skyrim, though there are DLC (which I believe is included) which adds an island and an independant city to which you can teleport, and I also recall that Morrowind has more caves/tombs than Oblivion or Skyrim so it likely has more underground terrain than the two of them.\n\nI hope I addressed the pros and cons equally here. Oh, one thing that's always bugged me is that magicka doesn't automatically regenerate. You have to drink potions or sleep... but I never bothered looking up a mod to fix this... namely because I found it fun to simply have a drink every time I drink a potion to replenish my magicka :P As for fatigue diminishing as you run, I LOOOOVE realism, so I was saddened when I found it missing in Oblivion, allowing you to jog in full armour anywhere you like, but a mod helped fix that problem so now I lose fatigue by sprinting in Oblivion as well :) Cheers, and hope you enjoy the game! God knows I did and still do!\n\nOh yeah, as for armour customization, there's helmet, cuirass, left pauldron, right pauldron, left gauntlet, right gauntlet, greaves, and boots. You can LITERALLY wear 8 different types of armour if you so choose, which is an impossibility in Oblivion or Morrowind.\n\nMy most common character choices are probably as follows:\n\nRace: Imperial (Sometimes Nord)\nGender: Male (always)\nHair: Dark Brown (either short or long)\n\nMajor Skills:\nLong Sword\nDestruction\nSpeechcraft\nMarksman\nMedium Armour (Sometimes I go with Light Armour instead, but NEVER Heavy Armour or Unarmoured. Yes, Unarmoured is an option)\n\nMinor Skills\nAlchemy\nMercantile\nBlacksmithing\nBlock\nAlteration (Learn to FLY! Though sometimes I go with Mysticism so I can capture souls in gems more effectively)\n\nI can't rightly recall the exact number, but with this combination, my Long Sword starts around 50 give or take 5 levels I think. Speechcraft is way up there as well, and Marksman is not too bad at all. Speaking of which, are there crossbows in Oblivion or Skyrim? I don't recall, but they are most certainly in Morrowind, along with throwing knives, darts, and shurikins or whatever they're called. Ninja stars. Sounds kind of lame, but you find enchanted arrows/shurikins/knives somewhat commonly. Adds some magical damage, which helps.\n\nAlright this is basically the second time I'm ending this review, cheers!

It certainly doesn't looks as good as those games, and the combat isn't as sharp, but it outshines them both in challenge and in freedom. Morrowind does not hold your hand; it does not direct you to points of interest and give you tips on how to improve. It simply offers a massive world to you and lets you do with it as you wish. Of course the main story wil show you a path, but don't expect waypoints or fast travel; You want to progress? It's all on you.

This game is hailed as one the greatest TES game by some, nice blast from the past by others. Whilst I haven't got far in the way of story I have certainly gained enough expirirence to talk about it. The first question I asked myself is if this game will hold up to previous TES titles. The answer is, it does, it's over a decade old and can still hold up in comparison to the later titles such as Oblivion and Skyrim in fact, Skyrim had plenty of references to Morrowind (Music from Morrowind soundtrack, Destroying the Dark Brotherhood, random assasination attempt on your life etc.). Morrowind, like the later games, rewards you for exploration, I once found a lovely Nordic Battle Axe (for which I had been searching for for quite some time) in a cave I reluctantly entered. I felt happy with myself for making this choice and made it a rule that I shall walk everwhere on foot because I will likely get rewarded for the extra time spent and I get to admire the scenere (Which whilst outdated graphically, still makes me want to stop and enjoy and plus Graphics isn't the greatest thing about the game). I once found myself looking for a bunch of Thieves held up in a cave with no idea on their exact location. I chanced upon a camp (of sorts) inhabited by three dunmir in robes. I proceeded forward, believing them to be friendly, to which I was blatted in the face by three seperate spells and was nearly killed (me and my friends have taken to calling this expirience TES Z). Overall, Morrowind is a brillaint game with a lovely world and great gameplay (considering it was released a dozen years ago I think we can excuse it on some points as it was grounbreaking for it's time). I would certainly reconmend it to any TES fan or RPG fan.","September 23, 2014","true","34.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

My clocked hours is misleading, as i played most of this game during a car ride across the USA, btw. But to the point, this game is beautiful, in many ways. My favorite part is the environment and the atmosphere. Vvardenfel is such a strange place, you feel like your on another planet sometimes. Wandering through the ashlands, trudging through the swamps, or delving into a daedric ruin, there is tons of stuff to explore.  The dark elf culture is so vibrantly displayed, as is their reactions to other cultures. The customs and armors (especially bonemold, i love that stuff) are so peculiar and awesome, its like nothing you'll find elsewhere.  The sounds are great as well. The soundtrack fits perfectly with the game, however it is only 30min long, and the repitition gets a wee bit annoying sometimes.  The thing that i love the most about it is its complexity. This is not an easy game, and you need some knowledge to get through, unlike Skyrim, which was dumbed down for all the console CoD fans (still a great game tho). The leveling system works very well, the combat system does not. Using melee weapons is okay, but magic is freaking impossible. The graphics on this game are amazing, especially for 2002. They impress me even today. All in all, this is a great game. Highly reccomend it.","June 14, 2014","true","36.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I had always been interested in the other games if nothing more then for lore.\n\nMorrowind is an interesting game, from my perspective. Coming directly into this after Skyrim, it's a much different experience. I bought the Game of the Year edition to get the full experience, as I had been told this was probably the best Elder Scrolls game. I booted it up, and started playing.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is... Morrowind is NOT too kind to new players. You're thrown into the world with little to no direction other then go here and deliver a package. Which is not entirely a bad thing. Morrowind gives a sort of feeling of freedom, and pushes you to discover how things work on your own. While in Skyrim, there WAS a sort of feeling of "freedom", but if you did not do the main quest immedietally, or at least go into it, quite a few things were sealed off, like shouts and dragons. And the main quest always sort of felt like it was looming in the background and that I was screwing up by not playing it. Morrowind however, presented more of a... "Take your time to get to know the place" feel. How I can describe it from what I've played thus far? It's a lot like Dungeons and Dragons. You're thrown in, you pick your race, what you're good with, and your special skill/sign. Then you go into a world, get told your main quest... And then you do whatever you feel is right at the time. What REALLY gives it the DnD type feel to me is probably the dialog, which is fairly unique in feel.\n\nI'll probably come back to redo this review once I get a few more hours in, or at least enough knowlege of how to play the game correctly. This is my first impression review from someone who never played Morrowind. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.","December 31, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What you witness before you is hands down one of the greatest games of all time. A stunning masterpiece bearing odd design choices and bugs, but equally cherished for its charm and flaws.\n\nUnless it’s cries of “Absolutely fantastic!”, “Bloody marvellous!” or “♥♥♥♥in’ awesome!” To sum Morrowind up in a single paragraph is a crime against nature. Therefore, please read the rest of this lengthy review!\n\nKiddie Steam reviewer verdict: “left boat. gave fargoth his ring. went 2 inn. stole magic sword, escaped chasing guards. saw wizard fall frm sky, stole his clothes. rat attked me, so I killd it aftr 50 clicks. ran up mountain, killed by cliff racer. 10/10 wud mountain climb again.”\n\nLong ReviewBack in 2002 Morrowind was bundled freely with my Nvidia Ti4200-8x 128MB. I installed and fired up this game that my friend would just not stop talking about. A 15 year old at the time who disliked RPGs, Morrowind slapped me in the face and revolutionised my gaming experiences forever.\n\nGraphicsHard to believe these graphics were state of the art once upon a time: indeed, this was the first time I’ve seen water shaders used and it blew me away! However the draw distance is miniscule and it’s clear Morrowind was designed this way as using mods to increase the draw distance kills my frame rate on a PC that eats Skyrim + ENBs at a fluid 60fps. Still, I do recommend a draw distance mod because it’s not 2002 anymore and you need to see where you’re bloody going.\n\nDespite the short view, low poly meshes and blurry textures, the graphics themselves are by no means terrible and make the game world feel alive with a healthy organic colour palette, knowing when to dull the scene out or add vibrancy without becoming over saturated. This was before the dawn of post-processing turning everything either ♥♥♥♥ yellow, ♥♥♥♥ brown or losing your contact lenses.\n\nSoundDat menu music, wow. If like me you opened the game for the first time and hear the low drum beats followed by that sweet soothing melody caressing your eardrums, that’s a virgin experience no one can take away from you.\n\nThe soundtrack is a collaboration of traditional orchestral instruments, very easy on the ears and sets the mood of the game very well. Thanks to clever and deliberate use of subtle tones, I personally never found the music too repetitive and certain cues would instantly conjure up visions of my previous adventures. Jeremy Soule has outdone himself tenfold and really brings “Soule” into Morrowind, heh.\n\nSadly, Morrowind seriously lacks in the vocal department, and your journey across Vvardenfall will consists of lines of repeated dialogue from about 5 different actors. Not like other games don’t do this, but you’re expected to read large amounts of text rather than use your ears.\n\nSound effects are pretty decent, with a mixture of unique and generic FX bundled together. Not ground breaking stuff, but works extremely well in the world of Morrowind.\n\nCharacter DevelopmentNow here’s where Morrowind truly shines. Unlike most typical RPGs, Morrowind forgoes a strict class-based system in favour of allowing the player to do whatever the hell they please with their character. Be a magic dabbling barbarian or sneaky thief in heavy armour, the game won’t stop you.\n\nStealth mechanics are governed by skill more than anything else. You can nick a suit of armour right in front of an NPC in broad daylight and he won’t notice, but swipe a handkerchief from the dark room behind him and he’ll instantly become alerted. If it wasn’t clear, light has NO EFFECT whatsoever, so be prepared for a very strange stealth experience. Stealth is still fun though as nearly all my Morrowind characters have been thieves!\n\nRaising your skills occurs from repeated usage of said skill. Whilst ensuring you’re putting at least some elbow grease into levelling up, this system is widely open to exploitation, with well documented cases of repeatedly running up stairs to raise athletics or entering someone’s house and stabbing the ♥♥♥♥er to near death to raise combat skills. And speaking of combat...\n\nCombatThe notorious combat system is Morrowind’s biggest flaw, yet biggest charm. A supposed complex system that involves everything from skill level, fatigue, luck, random dice rolls and other RPG-ish powers that be, it all just boils down to frantically clicking the mouse button so that your 1 out of 20 hits will actually hit the ♥♥♥♥in’ thing – LITERALLY. An extremely illogical and tedious system where your 6ft spear magically misses the girth of a hungry bear, combat will be the bane of your existence during your fledging moments. Still, once you raise your stats to a worthy degree and able to one-shot all who dare stand in your path, the sense of progression from grasshopper to terminator feels VERY satisfactory!\n\nGame WorldThe island of Morrowind truly steals the show. The landscape is so diverse it’s ridiculous, with each region so rich enough it might as well have come from an entirely different game! From the swampy fishing villages in the Bitter Coast region, to the dark looming Red Mountain from the Ashlands, to the twisting architecture of the Telvanni district, to the floating building in Vivec City… Morrowind surprises, delights and surprises every single time, even for veterans commencing their 50th playthrough.\n\nNot many fast travel options available so expect to have to walk everywhere. A bit of a chore at times, but the island actually isn’t terribly large – it just feels that way because of the amount of love and care crafted into it. You will need to take your time with this one and plan for the journey ahead.\n\nAs per usual RPG standards you can find all manner of hidden caves, secrets, side quests and lewt. A pretty static gameworld, characters tend to stay in a single spot and all shops are open 24/7 at your convenience. Realistic? No. Beneficial? Yes. Don’t forget that full day and night cycles were rare back then.\n\nAll common NPCs share the same batch of (very well written) dialogue, so whilst it’s very handy to get information quick and fast, this results in most NPCs being just walking information booths (or punch bags) devoid of personality. Of course, many many NPCs still have their own unique text, so you’ll still enjoy a good dose of story telling.\n\nLastly the lore in the game is as thick as tar. Different races, religions, guilds, conflicts... Wanna know the history behind something? Find an in-game book about it. Curious about the conflicts between certain factions? Interview each faction about it, perhaps side with one, with both or none at all.\n\nNotesMorrowind used to crash back in the day. A LOT. I have played it in recent years and noticed much less crashing, however as a golden rule - save early and save often: if the cliff races don’t get ya, the CTDs will.\n\nSince this game is so old, it runs silky smooth on modern hardware, so no issues with optimisation.\n\nAs ever, there are thousands of mods to alter your game with, so like or don’t like something: there’s a mod for that.\n\nFinal WordsI really couldn’t tell whether Morrowind will appeal to you as a modern gamer, because the unforgettable experience I had of playing it as a teen has permanently blinded me with nostalgia. All I can say is this: Morrowind has left its mark on gamers and the gaming industry. It’s a masterpiece, it’s flawed, it’s epic, it’s fun, it’s frustrating, it’s magical, it’s scary, it’s emotional, it’s weird, it’s… yea.\n\nI guess you need to accept the mechanics and that it’s a product of its time. Whether you like it or not, I do hope you can at least acknowledge the impact it left on the gaming world back in 2002.","February 17","true","6.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rustiee/recommended/22320/","rustiee","lions r dum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rustiee/","134 products in account","*This article is somewhat unfinished. I definitely could add more, and I may update it later. Although, it is comprehensive as-is for a game review.\n\nOne of the greatest games I have ever played.\n\nI just want to highlight the skill system here, for some of the good and inherently bad things about it.\nThe thing about the skill system in Morrowind is that it has many skills and possibilities, but it is solely based on the gods of the RNG. The thing that's so bad about this, is that everything you do is based on a percentage, a number, and a chance or just that sliver of hope as a new character. Which means even if you are an extremely powerful level 50 character, you still have a chance of just completely missing the enemy and doing no damage.\n\nAnother thing I see people fail to realise in midst of their nostalgia for this game, is the Fatigue system. There is literally no reason for me not to be able to throw fireballs at people's faces because my Fatigue is low and the chance of casting is significantly lowered. And that's all I'll say about that, it's incredibly aggrevating.\n\nThe Graphics in this game- all I can say is that they're extremely dated and about 13 years old. They haven't exactly aged well. But although this game doesn't look terrible, it can still be jarring for a new player to come from Skyrim or Oblivion into this game (Like me...).\n\nThe Gameplay of this game is incredible, despite it's odd skill system. It's Classic RPG fundamentals are, in a way, the lifeblood of this game, despite it's oddities. In no other game can you walk up to a slow-moving mudcrab at level 1, completely miss every swing, and get yourself killed. Despite this, you can do anything you want, kill anyone or anything you want, steal, plunder, or even become the Grandmaster of almost every guild. Despite this, the game does NOT hold your hand. You have to work for what you want. Don't have enough gold for that Dreugh Helmet? Go to that dwarven ruin over the hill, kill everything inside, and find the treasures within. This game really captures the scope and expanse you would expect of an entire continent in the world. You can be prancing along in the rolling hills of the grazelands, and the next minute you're in the middle of Molag Amur, in the midst of pools of lava and ash. That being said, it still takes a while for that transition. Even for an old game, the map is huge (And there's much to do in that map!).\n\nThe Story is one of the pinnacle of this game. In more recent years, the story has not been bland, per se- but rather, it has been turned into this constant story that the game will try to make you feel rather inclined to stay with until that story has ended. For example, in Skyrim the main story was very heavily forced upon you. They try to create this false sense of "urgency" that you just do not find in this game. You are thrust into this world with no money, no hope, and no future. You are not respected as an outlander. People just do not like merging the ignorant "n'wahs" into their very complex and diverse society. As with anything in this game, you must earn their respect. There is tons of side-quests which, I will argue, are about 40% "Go fetch this for me" quests or, "Go kill this man for me". But even in these quests, Morrowind most definitely has an extensive story to tell, and quite an enthralling one at that.\n\nThe DLC in this game is phenominal! Much like the other Elderscrolls games, the downloadable content in this game is extremely good. (Minus the horse armor from Oblivion!) Rich, and deep with story- the activites and things to do in them are quite extensive. The first time I had gone to the Clockwork City in Tribunal, it was one of the most amazing experiences for me. Seeing the Clockwork City for the first time, I was absolutely astounded that I was really in a world created by a man-turned-god. Which is a feeling you don't get in most games today.\n\nAll-in-all, I think that this is a great game- and definitely stands the test of time today. With a few mods (which are still being made in 2015), this game can definitely net you countless hours of mudcrab-bashing fun. Definitely worth picking up, if you haven't already.","March 19, 2015","true","160.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

First time I played this game I was amazed with the graphics.  Definitely an improvement over Skyrim's.  The next thing I noticed was the voice acting.  Unlike the previous games that primarily used text, npcs will now actually talk to you.  After only 30 minutes of playing I noticed something that made this game stand out from all the other games.  It has an absolutely EPIC combat engine, based entirely on skill but focusing even more so on creating smooth, satisfying animations.  The first time I killed an Argonian slave was the moment I will never forget.  One more strong point of the game, before I focus on the negative ones.  This game was designed around stealth.  Caves, forts, ruins, and houses always give you the opportunity to use stealth rather than raw strength or use of magic.  It's entirely possible that you won't even have to kill one guy to complete 90% of the quests!  Now it's time I warn you of the game's weak spots, for there are many.  The main quest is a very cliche "defeat the Dunmer trying to turn himself into a god at a volcano" kinda deal.  It's obvioiusly stolen from Lord of the Rings and doesn't appeal to me or other loyal Elder Scrolls fans.  I have also noticed that this game has forgotten about the role play aspect of The Elder Scrolls.  No longer does combat, lockpicking, speechcraft and other skills rely on character skill, but now they rely on player skill.  There is also the problem of bad landscape designers; it all seems very bland and a little too repetitive.  In Skyrim we had mountains, Oblivion we had wonderful hills and forests... in this game we have nothing good, nothing new.  Feels like I'm exploring my neighborhood, not a new fantastical world.  Aside from those main issues, there are only a small amount of bugs and quircks about the game.  For example, the loading times are ridiculous when compared to newer games like Skyrim.  If you're looking for a beautiful, action packed, incredibly realistic game, then this is the one you want.  If you liked the original Elder Scrolls games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, and Elder Scrolls Online that focus more on role play and, at least for Skyrim, a good storyline then I'd suggest you skip this one and wait for The Elder Scrolls VI.  Don't take my word for it though!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kouplek/recommended/22320/","kouplek","CoupleK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kouplek/","246 products in account","I love Morrowind. I've played probably around 300 hours of it and there's still lots of unique quests to explore. That being said, if I take off my nostalgia glasses, there are some pretty major flaws that I feel anyone playing it for the first time today should be aware of. Breaking it down:\n\nCons:\n* Combat of all types is boring. Magic/Stealth/Archery/Melee are all essentially reduced to keep-clicking-until-it-dies. On the magic side of things, the spell creation system is fun and there are lots of neat base spells to choose from, but in essence the combat itself is overly simple.\n* The leveling system functions fine if you just don't pay attention to it, but optimal leveling is a tedious chore. If you are the type who just can't pass up an opportunity for maximum stat gains, this might be a big detractor.\n* The dialogue is text based and most NPCs are just walking lore encyclopedias. The persuasion and bartering systems are laughably simple, and again, boring.\n* The graphics haven't aged well, though it does have a strong artistic concept at its core.\n* The menu interface is sub-par, but gets the job done.\n\nPros:\n* Exploration is really well rewarded. Everywhere you look there's some small detail that hints at a story, or a unique artifact with interesting properties. Many of the ruins have secret entrances and places that you could easily miss.\n* Morrowind does a good job of making you feel like your actions have impact. It could be better, but it is satisfying when factions will hate or love you depending on what you've done, and there are many unique dialog lines based on how famous you are.\n* The quests are unique. Sure some of them blend together a little bit, but overall they are NOT just cookie-cutter quests. Most of them give you some insight into the world and how it works, or have some neat little twist.\n* You can fly. It seems so trivial but I keep coming back to this as an example of the game's overwhelming freedom. It's fun scrounging around in the early game for limited-use levitation spells or the infamous Scrolls of Icarian Flight which make you jump so high you'll certainly die on your way back down. You start out so weak but there are powerful scrolls and spells to exploit that can change the entire game... the wild variance in the power of the enemies and items you encounter is one of Morrowind's stronger points.\n* A final important pro is the modding community. If there are things you don't like about this game, chances are high there's a mod that can change it. In particular, I have a had good luck with graphics mod compilations and just general expansion packs. Of course, modding is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea.\n\nIn summary, this game has many great features and in some ways the sense of depth and scale you get when immersed in it is unrivaled by any game since. However, it requires a certain type of gamer, (or a certain amount of modding,) to get past its unpalatable quirks and into the wonderful world beneath.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Just going to address a couple points that have come up in the comments.\n* Discrepancy in my playtime listed vs what I have on record with Steam. I played Morrowind in 2004 just after the GOTY edition came out, which was before it was on Steam. I later purchased it on Steam because I had lost my physical copy.\n* I love Morrowind yet gave it a non-recommendation. I wrote this review for the general gaming public in 2013 and I did not think it would be a good experience for the average 2013 Steam gamer because of the points listed above, hence my non-recommendation.","August 12, 2013","false","5.9"," 544 of 1,069 people (51%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","51","544","1","14","64"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Rabbit42/recommended/22320/","The_Rabbit42","The Rabbit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Rabbit42/","191 products in account","Disclaimer: I have only played the three most-recent Elder Scrolls games: Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. I am sadly ignorant on the quality of the earlier installments.\n\n---\n\nMorrowind is my favorite modern Elder Scrolls game. Period.\n\nThere are some downsides. Graphically, Morrowind is increasingly dated. It comes from an unfortunately time (early 2000's) in history where full 3D games tried to portray realism without the resources to do so convincingly. Environments are fairly low res. As far as NPCs are concerned, they're not uncanny valley. They're just kind of crappy-looking, and lack the individual daily schedules that NPCs have in later games. Here, they wander within a short range, but people who you encounter outside will forever be standing outside, never to even set foot in their homes. Mechanically, the game can be rough around the edges. In Oblivion and Skyrim, furthering one's combat skill means increased damage. Starting out in Morrowind, low sword skill means you're unlikely to even hit your target when you swing. It's a steep curve, to be sure, and representative of how the game approaches skills and leveling up. Additionally, the quest log -- the game's system for tracking general learned information and info pertaining to specific active or inactive quests -- is unorganized and difficult to work with. It is barely a step above remembering what you're actively doing, and trying not to take up any other tasks until it is completed.\n\nSo what really separates Morrowind from later Elder Scrolls games?\n\nThe world is large and real. This isn't scandanavia or medieval England. This is a world unlike any other, with giant mushrooms and huge insects. It is interesting, unique, and worth exploring. And explore you will, because there is no fast-travel. The best form of transportation are via specific routes between certain cities -- boats, Mages Guild teleportation, large land beasts, etc. Anything else, be it going to off-the-beaten-path settlements, or simply getting to one of those hub towns, requires hoofing it. It adds a staggering degree of realism that later games stripped away. The world isn't actually larger, but the game presents itself that way. There are more guilds and organizations. More missions for those guilds. More cities, towns, and people. There's an openness to it because the cities aren't walled in, a separate level from the outside.\n\nThe player also has a degree of agency that hasn't existed in Elder Scrolls games since. The degree of skill customization is extensive: more kinds of weaponry to specialize in, more kinds of armor, more branches of magic and spells within those branches. The player also has a lot more freedom to affect the world in permanent ways. You actions in one guild will affect other guilds. Everyone can be killed, including quest givers and NPCs integral to the main story. The world is yours to take. Oblivion introduced the concept of player-bought houses. No such game-sanctioned method exists in Morrowind. Instead, acquiring a house involves using your freedom. You could find a house that appears abandoned and move in, or you could find a nice house, murder the occupant, dispose of their body, and make it yours. There aren't items that are free to take and items that constitute stealing. There's just items, and you can steal them.\n\nThe NPCs that inhabit Morrowind offer vastly more variety. With brief exceptions, the game has no voice acting. All dialogue is simply textual, and different personalities can be revealed through the text of their dialogue. Every NPC doesn't have the same voice, creating the impression of world populated by artificial clones. This fact alone almost certainly influenced the rest of the game, because it meant that something as simple as adding another Thieves Guild quest didn't involve more voice and audio work.\n\nThis, in a way, describes the game as a whole. It's clear that, when the game was being developed, there was a lot more freedom to add content and run wild when developing the game. It bleeds into almost every aspect of the game. It's not as smooth, nor as pretty, as later installments, but it's a world worth exploring,","November 27, 2013","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, there is room here for an incredible amount of customization in how you build your character. If you have the patience for it, this is well worth your time. Be warned though, the graphics have not aged well.\n\nLike all of these though there is a ton of mods available for graphical updates and people are still adding content today. With the Tamriel Rebuilt project still going on, you could sink an insane amount of your life in here.\n\n","November 29, 2014","true","76.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was not disappointed when I started playing Morrowind. The game is a bit dated, graphically and gameplay-wise, but I think it offers a lot of fun times and interesting ways to play.\n\nPros:\n-text based dialogue gives more information and options that aren't limited by voiceovers\n-intricate magic and leveling systems allow for truly amazing customization\n-main quest is really interesting so far (I'm about 30 hours in)\n-the lore is vast, making it seem like a living, breathing world despite the aged mechanics\n-the creature designs are simply amazing... creepy and intimidating...\n-varied map makes the world seem even bigger than it is (in-game fast travel options add to immersion too)\n-in game strip club with some swag moves\n-score by the same guy who did Skyrim's soundtrack (and SW KOTOR and Bounty Hunter)\n\nCons:\n-lack of tutorials means you have to either experiment for endless hours or get help online with gameplay mechanics\n-some stock dialogue gets repetitive\n-soundtrack is limited... you will hear the same explore tracks over and over again\n-graphics are dated (though I really enjoy the oldschool feel)\n-difficult to tell what you can and can't do in-game... some enemies look tough but get killed easily and vice-versa\n-those who know what they're doing can totally break the game and become godlike (Is that a con? Still not sure...)\n\nBasically, this game is really cool. Even if it were worse than Skyrim or Oblivion in every aspect, it's still really unique and offers a lot of cool exploration. I suggest looking up videos about why Morrowind is the best TES game. They'll do it more justice.\n\nI definitely reccommend this game to anybody who wants to see a little more of Tamriel.","December 3, 2014","true","81.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xabu1/recommended/22320/","xabu1","Sphaarx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xabu1/","326 products in account","The Gold Standard of open world RPG. The mother of all RPG games to come after it. Morrowind revolutionized the idea of an open world game. There is depth to the world that is unparalleled in both games released before this as well as afterwards. The game is dated, so there is something to be said about how smoothly the game runs and looks and feels, but there are many mods that can be used to remedy those issues (http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36945/?).\n\nThis game begins with you as a prisoner. No history, you can become whatever you want to be. You can create a character who does anything you want. The depth of the character development allows you to become anything you want. You can choose follow a pre-built class chosen from a list of 21 including classes such as: sorceror, thief, and warrior. Or you can be something new and creative by creating your own class. If you want (and I did this), you can be a walking tank with a two handed battleaxe wearing plate armour imbued with the blood of demons. You can choose to be one of one of ten races, each with their own characteristics, each with their stereotypes that generate responses unique to that race from NPCs. You can even choose to become a vampire or (with the bloodmoon expansion included in the Game of the Year edition) werewolf!This means you will have a unique experience in your game that nobody else has quite experienced.\n\nWhile the character creation system is very powerful, it can be confusing for a starting player. The key is you don't have to worry about it. The system has very specific things you can do to optimize your character, but you can enjoy the game just as well without employing those strategies.\n\nIn playing this game, you find yourself planted in a world, complete with history, religion, science, and anything else you would expect and more. You can find books with conflicting religions. You can worship demons known as daedra. You can read about Vivec ascending to godhood and the religion surrounding them. There are several religious texts in the game that you can read. It is quite a project to learn about the world, sometimes I wonder if I know more about the Elder Scrolls universe or the outside world.\n\nThe province of Morrowind is in a time of peril. The longstanding religion of worshipping AlmSiVi, the tribunal, is wavering. An old enemy is rising again. You have complete control over what you do with the world. You can completely ignore the world's issues and go to set out to just explore caves, crypts, and other areas on your own. You can go join a guild and rise through those ranks, You can even kill people who are essential to saving the world. You can save the world, or you can just as well doom it. The game is whatever you want it to be.\n\nThis game is the gold standard of RPG for a reason and all current open world RPGs are based off of this amazing game. If you enjoy any open world RPG,  it is a must to come back to the roots of the genre and play the amazing game that really started it all.","November 7, 2014","true","159.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is because at the time it's graphics were good, tons to explore, and most importantly, it was the first ES game to port to a console and do it succesfully. It established standards for open-world games and earned itself "Game of the Year", and Bethesda celebrated that by re-releasing it at the time with 2 Expansion packs, eah with their own intrigueing stories and atmospheres. We are going to explore this game and why it is such a huge success and why it is a classic, but also why it might not appeal to newer fans of ES that started with things like ES IV or V*\n\nPros:\n\nStoryline\n\nThe story is well thought out and is deep and enaging, but also mysterious as well as intrigueing. Without spoling too much, the story consists of you following the story of the ancient dumner hero known as "Nerervar" and why he is so important to the native tribes of Vvardenfell as well as the people of the civilized part of the island. Your exploits soon discover  a secret cult, shrouded in mystery and dread, known as the "Sixth House", ans soon dsicover they have a lot more planned than the world even knows a the time. With these secretive and covert ops, you come to blows with the local religious establishment known as the "Tribunal Temple", which rules most of Morrowind through a merciful, but inquisitive, theocratic state. All of these factions are aware of prophecies of the acient island, and harbor dark secrets that are known to themselves and why they commit to their odd actions.\nThe background lore is solid, with many books and inside lore to fill the mind of the confused player who is embroiled within this conflict. You must persuade and threaten everyone from simple commoners to living gods to determine what the whole scheme of things is and to reveal the whole plot to the player.\n\nExploration\n\nFrom artifacts to mundane bonemeal, you almost never know what you will find in the next cave or tomb you enter a stupid cave with nothing, or you could find a secret daedric ruin within a tomb, and follow it's path to find a long and sought after artifact! Only you can wll yourself to explore, and is there a LOT to explore. There are som many dungeons, so many caves and tombs, that I havn't even foud everything, and i've played this game for YEARS.\n\nFully Customized Characters\n\nYour cosmetics might not be that open to possibilities, but the stats of your character are completley open to experiment with. FInd the best combinations, etermine your playstyle, which can be literally ANYTHING you could imagine. Unlike in ES IV and V, your playstyle is not pushed in a certatin direction. Nope; you can be a jumping, fireball throwing lunatic, a naked sneak-theif, a half- naked mage, you can play however you like.\n\nAvid Modding Commute\n\nEven though Ste.Wor.Sho.* doesn't support, their are 10,000's of mods out there for your choosing, from graphics to gameplay to sound and body mods, the mod community continues to thriveto this day. One mod that is essential, however, is the "Morrowind Code Patch" mod, which fixes many bugs and bad scripting that unfortunatly takes place in this game.\n\nJump Across a Continet in under 5 min. of Gameplay!\n\nPretty self explanatory, just go out of town and follow the path till you see a book on the ground and hear screams.\n\nCons\n\nMelee Combat\n\nMelee combat is sadly a joke in ES III. Everything is based off of chance, and so you can be swinging a battleaxe into someone's face, but if your skill is too low, you still won't hit, which can be rather immersion breaking.\n\nGraphics didn't age well\n\nTHis is an old game, and the graphics didn't age well at all. Bad polygon count, poor view range and bad lip synce plague this game. Many graphics mods change many of these features, however, and fix most problems quite nicely. Thank the mod community.\n\nBegginers Beware\n\nIf you don't know what you're doing, watch out, for yo will find yourself in the wrong cave fighting a level 30 monster who wants to rip your n*ts off. Just think carefully before you go anywhere to dangerous and don;t be afraid to run away if things get too rough.\n\nNeed a wiki?\n\nYes, even with it's deep, underlying story, some things are never explained in terms of quest objectives, what to do, as well as some lore issues, and some explanations as to where someone is. I presonally reccoment UESPWiki to help with many of your dilemas in this department.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, an ageless classic and well worth your time, for it lays down the doundations for many of the ground breaking features in later ES games, and introduces so many lore points tat willl you will be for more.\n","January 27, 2015","true","95.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing it throughout the years, since it first released on Xbox back in Spring of 2002.\n\nYou have a huge, carefully-constructed open world to discover with dozens upon dozens of unmarked caves and dungeons and ruins to explore. Hidden easter eggs and references scattered throughout :0\n\nExtensive and thought out skill system. Customize your character into whatever you want. A rouge that favors spears and uses paralysis spells and wears medium armor. A mage that focuses on alteration to bend the environment to their will, while also specializing in sneak to steal anything not bolted to the floor. Splendid combinations!\n\nLevitation as well. Don't feel like climbing or walking around a giant mountain? Drink or use a levitation spell and you'll soon be soaring through the skies... with cliff racers D:\n\nTwo other expansion packs, Bloodmoon and Tribunal, further expand upon the story and offer new locations, powerful items and other goodies. Definitely well worth the time to play through those. I quite like Tribunal as my favorite =]\n\n\nAnd, of course, there are the hundreds of mods available, if you don't quite like the vanilla game in all it's low-resolution meshed-together glory.

To make long journey/story short, it was mind blowing experience. After reading people's opinions about it's predesor, Morrowind, I have decided on one golden midsummer afternoon to give it a go. And boy was I in for a journey. My first thought going in to the game "looks boring!" and my first thought fighting some monsters "what the ====?". But I did not let those two things stop me from playing. I kept at it and believed that I would have an unbelievable experience. and Boy did I get it. I spent nearly my whole half of the summer playing Morrowind! Each day felt like a dream (in a fantasticaly good way). Walking outside was different after I have played the game because I was so "high" from the game! The details.. my God! The quests were so fun and the traveling was realistic. Items were actually fun to collect rather than just ignoring every thing you came by. I loved that the items that were placed on the environment were actually part of the environment! It was as if you could take out a pot in a painting and put it back without breaking the "morrowind" immersion! (unlike achoo Skyrim). Give this one a go. I loved playing it and I just started playing once more. But just so you know, the game is not so social. If you are naturally a quiet and a smart individual, you will like this game.

No other game I've played has introduced me to a world so unique and compelling. It's not the writing or the gameplay that does it, but the design of it.\n\nA few things were present in Morrowind to aid this that no later Elder Scrolls game had, and they suffered for it; the complete lack of radar, the journal system that let you forget about quests you didn't care about, the ability to kill any NPC and the ability to levitate. The Elder Scrolls series at its core, to me anyway, is about discovery. It's about being thrown into a vast open world with something new around every corner, and the freedom to get lost.\n\nMorrowind does that better than any game I know.

While the look of the game was fantastic when it was released, Morrowind has the smallest game world of a true Elder Scrolls game and it takes some thorough exploring just to get a handle on the unique nature of this region in Tamriel and the grave threat facing its inhabitants. There's a wide variety of quests you can complete and a solid variety of guilds to consider joining, but Morrowind can be somewhat difficult to find entertaining these days due to the age of its graphics engine and the more than minor detail that almost no characters are voiced. Neither is the fault of Bethesda when you consider the limitations of CD-ROMs and hard drives of its time. I'll definitely say Morrowind was a step in the right direction for the Elder Scrolls series, but sadly no where near the resounding success that Skyrim would be a decade later. 2 1/2 stars out of 4.","June 9, 2013","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He was so excited, kept rambling on about how you can fly around the map and stuff, still didn't really interest me much. Finally I got to try it out after him hyping it up...and It just didn't really click for me. Maybe it was because I was so young, or the fact that I just didn't play that many games back then, I just couldn't get into it.\nTook a couple years till i finally got a PC, and remembering this game I saved up for it, and wow, I don't know what changed, but suddenly this was the best thing I had ever seen. Seriously, ignore my hours on steam, I've put so much time into this game, its pretty much impossible to even estimate how long, and funny enough, I've never beaten it. That's how much stuff there is to do, not only that, but this game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard haha. Not in a bad way, but I remember being stuck on the first quest (that damn dwemer box...) for months, and still had fun just ranking up in the fighters guild until i realized I could just look it up online....\n\n\nRanting aside, this is an awesome game. If your into RPG's, need something that will (almost) definitely run on your rig, or just wanna see some old school Elder Scrolls history of sorts, I'd say buy it.\nThe main flaws you will probably hear about it is the combat being weird (random dice rolls on every hit, meaning you could be standing there swinging at something and missing over and over when your inches from your opponent...a little weird i have to admit), and maybe the out dated graphics.

You are only given typical "turn by turn" directions to quest locations and are expected to find your own way in the world with almost no hand holding after the first 30 min of gameplay. The combat is all based entirely on character skill and not player skill, not that your wits won't take you longer than your stats in this game because they will. There are thousands of hours of quest lines and intriguing untold stories to explore throughout the vastness of the world. I played it for untold hours on the xbox and PC before this steam version were released and thanks to the overhaul mod I will probably play it for many more hours still.

The music, world, and plot are all top-notch. The only problem is the game itself is well, a bit of a chore. The combat, frankly, is quite awful, as it lacks both the tactical appeal of a top-up party based western RPG like Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age and the fluid action gameplay of a proper action-RPG like Skyrim. You just click repeatedly and hope you hit. Like all Elder Scrolls games, you level up what you use, but the way Morrowind does it can lead to some mildly ridiculous metagaming. (eg: Oh dear, I'd better avoid jumping for the rest of the level or my Acrobatics stat will get ahead of my Short Blades stat.) I would prefer Morrowind's multiple attributes such as strength, speed, intelligence, and willpower to Skyrim's three, health, stanima, and magica, if the sole purpose in every stat in Morrowind was not to raise your health, stanima, or magica, or to raise damage/resistance, which Skyrim did via skills and perks. For example, your character's dialogue isn't any different if he's got an Intelligence of 60 or 30, so why bother keeping count? In Dragon Age, you got unique dialoge options based on your cunning stat, and low intelligence characters in Neverwinter Nights talked reel dum liek thiz. If the only purpose of Intelligence is to get more magica, then honestly, they were streamlining, not dumbing down when they got rid of it in favor of the Magica stat directly. While exploration is much touted, enemies aren't leveled, and as such, may be ridiculously easy or hard depending on the area. This is, of course, more realistic than enemies always being just tough enough for you, and wouldn't be a problem if leveling didn't feel like such a damned grind. To be brutally honest, there are times it feels like a MMO in a vacant world. Other things touted as "perks" by Morrowind afficianados may be tinted a bit by nostalgia as well, I suspect. For example, some people decry that gauntlets come as sets in Oblivion and Skyrim, but to be honest, it feels a bit stupid when a store has three left steel gauntlets and no right ones for sale. Does it cater to one armed men or something? I won't criticize the game based on technological inferiority to more modern games because doing so would be grossly unfair and with all Elder Scrolls games, it's fun enough to ♥♥♥♥ around in. However, in all honesty, I reccomend the game more for the fact that it's required to run the upcoming Skywind mod for Skyrim which modernizes the graphics and gameplay while maintaining Morrowind's unique aesthetic and story than the game in its own right. Morrowind is a dated masterpiece, a labor of love to be sure, but if anyone tries to tell you that it is a perfect game, and that more modern games are for stupid illiterate mouth-breathing console peasants, you should gently inform them that it is that sort of attitude that makes Lord Vivec cry.","July 10, 2014","true","60.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably the truest RPG Bethesda has ever made. If you can get a handle on the somewhat challenging character growth system, enjoy a game with older graphics, and put up with a few odd bugs, it's one of the better entries into the TES series. Main questline good and quite lengthy (30+ hours). With plenty of factions to join and interesting side quests it will keep you busy for weeks or even months. If you can, get the GOTY edition; Tribunal and Bloodmoon are both fantastic and Skyrim's Dragonborn DLC will make a lot more sense. Only minor complaints would have to be 1) shields auto-block which makes combat feel a lot less skillful; 2) it's impossible to retrieve arrows from the environment which makes arrows a scarce commodity. I was afraid to use my good arrows for basically the entire game because of this; 3) fast travel is only from city to city, which means there is a lot of walking involved. Not necessarily a horrible thing, because there are some cool random NPC encounters along roads, but it does slow the game's pace down a bit and it would be nice to be able to fast travel from the map screen like you can in Oblivion and Skyrim. Overall though it's a great game, especially if you're a TES fan. 9.5/10","March 17, 2014","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But with a game this vast, not even an hour or two, let alone half an hour, is nearly enough time to take it all in. The level of detail is astounding, especially when compared to it's sequels. Oblivion was a reletively large area with only a few different landscapes, and each location seemed reminiscent of the last, and while Skyrim is a huge game, full of detail, it still lacks the complexity of Morrowind. For anyone tolerant enough to get over the sub-par graphics (they were fantastic for their time however), and anyone patient enough to get over the initially frustrating combat system, they will love this game for it's diversity, complexity, and character. If you're a fan of Elder Scrolls games, but have only tried the latest ones, or a fan of RPGs in general, get this game.

My childhood in a nutshell. I was psyched to see that it was on Steam, after my obnoxiously long playthrough of the Xbox version. I didn't know what to think of the game when I first started, to be perfectly honest. That day my brother threw it to me and said he didn't like it, I took it upon myself to learn about this game and see what it was about.\n\nBoy, was I in for an adventure.\n\nI don't think I had ever heard of the Elder Scrolls series before I picked up this game. I took it as one of those silly, few hour adventure games that I could simply blow through and not care what was going on. The moment I stepped off that boat at Seyda Neen...yeah, I was DEAD wrong. I immediately jumped into the story with a hybrid thief/warrior build Argonian that I took it upon myself to name 'Trogdor,' due to my at-the-time obsession with Homestar Runner, and the plot literally sucked me in. I could play this game for HOURS and never get bored. Just exploring the environment and doing the main questline was enough to keep me interested. The characters were definitely memorable than I thought they would be, and the story really made me wonder why my brother had tossed it aside so quickly.\n\nOne of the points I have to make is about the combat system. Since this game was the prequel to Oblivion, it's to be expected. Back then, I really didn't care about weapon accuracy being based on your weapon proficiency, but when you're constantly exchanging blows with your opponent, you can't help but rage when you only hit about 10% of the time. That is, until you've got about 70-80 in your preferred weapon type. Jumping back from Skyrim or Oblivion...it may be a bit difficult to adjust from being able to land every hit on your opponent at level 1. Enemy movement is also a little bit clunky, but it just takes a bit of time to get used to.\n\nThe endgame had to have been one of my most favorite parts of the game, especially when you're mowing down enemies with more powerful enchanted weapons and spells. It may become a bit unbalanced, but, come on, you're the Nerevarine. Does it really matter? The extra content and locations provided by the DLC also add to the experience, especially scaling the enemies to a more comfortable and somewhat challenging level.\n\nAll in all though, I'd definitely recommend this game for anybody looking to get into an engrossing RPG with branching questlines and a memorable world. For those of you that prefer a more...streamlined experience, you can't go wrong with the many graphics and combat system overhaul mods that are out there. Give it a try, see if you like it.","June 29, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If Oblivion and Skyrim are great, this is a masterpiece. It does have flaws however, which we will touch on later. You probably think my opinion is tainted by nostalgia. Well it isn't. I picked this game up in 2014, after playing Oblivion and Skyrim, beat the main questline with no mods and loved every moment of it. It doesn't speak to everyone, though. Some will hate things like the lack of fast travel or quest markers, the huge map, the complicated plotline, unforgiving creatures, unfamiliar environments and cliffracers, but others will thrive on them.\n\nBut let's get into the features. This episode of TES is set on the Island of Vvardenfell, a land full of of ash, dunmer, daedric ruins and cliffracers. Probably the most unique map I've seen. To the south there is swamplands, governed by House Hlaalu, to the east we have the grasslands of House Telvanni and to the north the ashlands of House Redoran. There is also the Island of Soltheim (Yes, the one from Dragonborn) and the capital city of Mounhold. The game has the same ten races of the other games in the series (Dunmer, Altmer, Bosmer, Redguard, Nord, Orc, Imperial, Breton, Khajit and Argonian), and allows you to create your own character from scratch. You can be a warrior, a wizard, an archer (I don't recommend archery) and more. One of the things that makes Morrowind shine is the character development. Unlike Skyrim, where within about 5 hours you're a badass known throughout the lands, Morrowind took me 48 hours to become that. At the start you will be laughed at and mocked by the native Dunmer, but by the end of the main quest you'll be a hero 10 times as epic as the Dragonborn.\n\nSpeaking of main quests, Morrowinds story is great. You'll start off doing jobs for the Blades, but gradually you will learn of an ancient prophecy, and how you may be the fabled 'Nerevarine'. At the end, it will still be uncertain whether you really are Nerevar reborn or not. No matter what you do, you won't pleaser everyone. You will meet all kinds of characters, all with different beliefs. While many NPCs are basically made of peanuts, the different groups shine through. The Empire technically rules Morrowind, and aids you on your quest. House Hlaalu are peaceful with the Empire, but still Dunmer at heart. House Telvanni hate the empire, and stay to themselves in their mushroom towers to the east. House Redoran live in the north, in odd shell houses. The ashlanders are the native tribes of Vvardenfell, believing in ancient prophecies of Nerevarine, but are being prosecuted by the Tribunal Temple.\n\nAs always, I recommend learning some basic lore before starting. Take a look at this series https://www.youtube.com/user/ShoddyCast , or read some ingame books.\n\nMorrowind is much more like a table-top RPG then the rest of the series. Certain parts will require a little imagination, for example, instead of having a cutscene take place during a disturbing dream, you will read a textbox. Or instead of voice acted conversations, you will have to read.\n\nThe game still has a strong cult following 12 years after its release, with many lore sites, D&D style RPs and an active steam community, and its easy to see why. If you find the game too hard, there is a ton of mods to improve that. Or you could just stick with it for 10 hours or so like I did, and eventually you'll enjoy it.\n\nHowever there are some constroversial negatives (Some find them positives) such as: No voice acting, unfamiliar environment, lack of voice acting, cardboard NPCs, harsh environment, odd style, no fast travel or quest markers, bad journal system (Not really a problem, the GOTY fixes this), dice roll combat, confusing story, "bad graphics", lack of humour, lack of guns, lack of explosions, ability to 'fail the main quest' (If you do this, there is always the back path), deep and interesting lore, Fantasy setting, etc. Personally I like some of those, others not so much. Overall I recommend this to anyone who thinks they can handle a hardcore RPG, or is looking for a hardcore RPG to start off with.\n\n9.5/10","September 20, 2014","true","62.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

My personal quest was to score a Glass War Axe, as shown in the loading screens... it took me a few years to find one.

Morrowind allows freedom that the two games that followed just cant replicate. Spells, and enchanting bassically allow you to create things so powerfull, you would think it shouldnt even be allowed in the game, BUT, you can only achieve such things if you are smart enough to figure out how. Which brings me to my next point, everything in the game is layed out for you, the only things holding you back are skill levels. Once you get high enough levels, you can litterally make a spell to give you the abbility to fly, and shoot nukes at what ever the ♥♥♥♥ you want. You cant buy a house, but that doesnt mean you cant break into some dark elfs manor, kill him, and make his house your's. you can then drop your items where you want them to display them, tons of artifacts to collect. Bottom line, this game is very challenging, it sepparates the real gamers from the posers, the men from the children, It requires you to use youre head once, think about things, it doesnt force you to explore, it doesnt force you to talk to people, but if you dont, and you are lazy about it, this game will eat you alive, and you will be stuck. you literally have to LEARN.. you HAVE to learn, the lore, the skills, the weapons, the artifacts, the land, how to fight and survive. it makes the game very special, to me at the very least. You cant just bull ♥♥♥♥ your way through, quests are hard, there are no quest markers, dialouge is all text based. if you kill the wrong person you can doom the world which makes it impposible for you to finish the game or complete certain quests. the sad thing is, that its hard to get into this game these days, the graphics are dated for sure, the combat has some major flaws..  but if you can get past that, this game truely is brilliant, its fantastic, its simply more than words can describe. there is so much content, that im not sure any single person on this planet knows every little thing of information, item, or quest. If you think you can handle all of that.. then buy it, dont think, just do it.

There is no magical arrow in the sky showing you where to go, and even the smallest of encounters can be deadly. Fast travel exists only in the form of paid transports, running everywhere will render you too exhausted to fight effectively, untrained spells will fail and unpracticed attacks will miss.

This is the 3rd main title in the Elder Scrolls series, the first fully 3D game and the first with 100% hand crafted enviroment. This version includes both official expansion packs released to the game. While the game is excellent by itself, it is highly modable and let's you upgrade almost all aspect of it. In my opinion it's significance can only be compared to GTA 3 and Final Fantasy VII in their respective genres. A must have experience for RPG fans everywhere around the world, highly recommened. NOTE: There are independent content patches for this game and I'm not sure if they are included in this version. These can be found on the Bethesda website.\n\nLong review\n\nFirst of all sorry about this 'short' review, I had to cut the review in half and redo it completely to fit it in this tiny space. Also this is my first review, so bare with me. Let's get on with it then. Let me start with the beginning, character creation and tutorial. You start as a prisoner released to freedom by the emperor. For what reason? That you'll have to find out in the main quest. Sadly the game don't have too many options coming to character creation, it's very simplistic. Rather focus your attention to your race, class and birthsign: these will determine how powerful your character will be at the beginning. Why just the beginning? Because there is no limitation in skill progression in this game. You can max out everything. To help out newcomers I give a nice melee character combo: Redguard - Knight - The lady. The first building serves as the tutorial area, so examine everything you find, or just skip it entirely. In this game nothing is forced on you. After you got your relaese papers and fee, you are free in every possible respect. While you got pointers to where to go first, you are not forced to, you are set to explore the island of Vvardenfell. At first it seems like just a regular fantasy setting, except for maybe the giant bug you see right next to the village. Yes, that is just the beginning.  As you venture into the island the first thing that stands out are the giant, 10 meters high mushrooms in the grasslands. And further traveling in the island there is nothingness. Vegetation gone and vulcanic ash everywhere. You bump into ancient ruins of Dwemer, Daedric and Dunmer in origin, far from being abandoned. You can find cities made of giant crab shells and magicly altered mushrooms. Your travels will be slowed by ash storms, thunderstorm and bandits. But you'll have to walk, as you have limited ways of transportation in this game. Not all is hostile to you tho. You can find several towns and cities with merchants and inns to sleep in, but most importantly you can find guilds and factions to join. They not just give you additional quests, but they will provide discounted services for you and additional storyline . Speaking of quests, there is of course a main story in the game, which I don't want to spoil too much, is a great epic journey of a prisoner becoming one of the empire's blades agents and at the end ascending to godhood. The main story is about politics, religion, revenge and redemption. You are going to set things right in this land. As your adventure goes forward you will learn a lot about this land and the empire from NPCs and books. Books are also good for leveling your skills, which is mandatory, as this game is all about skills. Skills can go from 0 to 100, representing your chance to succeed in use of given skill. This is important, as the game doesn't make it a secret that everything you do is based on those hidden dice rolls and skill chances. There are no mini games here, even your sword swing is just a start of a dice roll. Skill are also important in leveling up your charater as there is no XP in this game. Instead you have to level 10 major or minor skills to level your character. And when you do, you can increase 3 of your attributes. You can add a multiplier to those attribute levels by leveling skills governed by that attribute. While character creation is simple and hard to do unique characters, the itemisation is very extensive. You can choose from several armor sets and weapon types. If you do not prefer weapons, there is a huge selections of spells to choose from. Even better, you can create your own spell. You can also create magical weapons and potions in the game. Voice acting is good in the game, even if the game is not fully voice acted. Every race has it's unique voice in the game. The music is excellent, composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule. While listening to the nice relaxing medieval melodies traveling the wilderness, it can quick turn to a battle chant when you got attacked. Outside of the game world one of the most important aspect is modding. This game can be modded by almost any way you want, or the engine lets you to. Glitches can be patched, graphical fidelity can be upgraded, new stuff can be added to the game. You can make this game feel and handle so much better if your are not satisfied with it's original ways. And there are some things to address here. The leveling system need some tweaking or complete overhaul. Character animation is bad for some races. Characters can use some more polygons just as better textures. A whole graphical overhaul is also can be on the table, especially the viewing distance. Player housing is completely missing from the game just like mounts. NPCs are few and very static with missing day/night cycles, you can change that too.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven if the game has several faults, it is nothing short of an ambitious project succeeded. The game has a unique feeling to it, loneliness is weightet heavily on your shoulders as you traverse the vulcanic wasteland of the island or it's catacombs. As you progress through the game and a greater evil force your hand to act, you slowly find a purpose and a goal, even the gods starts to smile on you. It can take 100s of hours of your life easily with one character, not to mention more. I hope I've encouraged you to try this or any of the Elder Scrolls games, they are great experiences. Also, if you are looking for the previous games, you can download the Elder Scrolls 1-2 for FREE from Bethesda.\n\nFeel free to comment and send me messages. Good gaming everyone!","August 17, 2014","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If Oblivion and Skyrim are great, this is a masterpiece. It does have flaws however, which we will touch on later. You probably think my opinion is tainted by nostalgia. Well it isn't. I picked this game up in 2014, after playing Oblivion and Skyrim, beat the main questline with no mods and loved every moment of it. It doesn't speak to everyone, though. Some will hate things like the lack of fast travel or quest markers, the huge map, the complicated plotline, unforgiving creatures, unfamiliar environments and cliffracers, but others will thrive on them.\n\nBut let's get into the features. This episode of TES is set on the Island of Vvardenfell, a land full of of ash, dunmer, daedric ruins and cliffracers. Probably the most unique map I've seen. To the south there is swamplands, governed by House Hlaalu, to the east we have the grasslands of House Telvanni and to the north the ashlands of House Redoran. There is also the Island of Soltheim (Yes, the one from Dragonborn) and the capital city of Mounhold. The game has the same ten races of the other games in the series (Dunmer, Altmer, Bosmer, Redguard, Nord, Orc, Imperial, Breton, Khajit and Argonian), and allows you to create your own character from scratch. You can be a warrior, a wizard, an archer (I don't recommend archery) and more. One of the things that makes Morrowind shine is the character development. Unlike Skyrim, where within about 5 hours you're a badass known throughout the lands, Morrowind took me 48 hours to become that. At the start you will be laughed at and mocked by the native Dunmer, but by the end of the main quest you'll be a hero 10 times as epic as the Dragonborn.\n\nSpeaking of main quests, Morrowinds story is great. You'll start off doing jobs for the Blades, but gradually you will learn of an ancient prophecy, and how you may be the fabled 'Nerevarine'. At the end, it will still be uncertain whether you really are Nerevar reborn or not. No matter what you do, you won't pleaser everyone. You will meet all kinds of characters, all with different beliefs. While many NPCs are basically made of peanuts, the different groups shine through. The Empire technically rules Morrowind, and aids you on your quest. House Hlaalu are peaceful with the Empire, but still Dunmer at heart. House Telvanni hate the empire, and stay to themselves in their mushroom towers to the east. House Redoran live in the north, in odd shell houses. The ashlanders are the native tribes of Vvardenfell, believing in ancient prophecies of Nerevarine, but are being prosecuted by the Tribunal Temple.\n\nAs always, I recommend learning some basic lore before starting. Take a look at this series https://www.youtube.com/user/ShoddyCast , or read some ingame books.\n\nMorrowind is much more like a table-top RPG then the rest of the series. Certain parts will require a little imagination, for example, instead of having a cutscene take place during a disturbing dream, you will read a textbox. Or instead of voice acted conversations, you will have to read.\n\nThe game still has a strong cult following 12 years after its release, with many lore sites, D&D style RPs and an active steam community, and its easy to see why. If you find the game too hard, there is a ton of mods to improve that. Or you could just stick with it for 10 hours or so like I did, and eventually you'll enjoy it.\n\nHowever there are some constroversial negatives (Some find them positives) such as: No voice acting, unfamiliar environment, lack of voice acting, cardboard NPCs, harsh environment, odd style, no fast travel or quest markers, bad journal system (Not really a problem, the GOTY fixes this), dice roll combat, confusing story, "bad graphics", lack of humour, lack of guns, lack of explosions, ability to 'fail the main quest' (If you do this, there is always the back path), deep and interesting lore, Fantasy setting, etc. Personally I like some of those, others not so much. Overall I recommend this to anyone who thinks they can handle a hardcore RPG, or is looking for a hardcore RPG to start off with.\n\n9.5/10","September 20, 2014","true","62.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The infamous 'do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want' or an open-world RPG game from the early 2000s.This game deserves its' GOTY award.\n\nThis game takes place at the 3rd era on the Elder Scrolls' world of Tamriel. You are a prisoner, being released in an island called Vvardenfell, located in Morrowind, the home of the Dunmers, or the dark elves. From there, you decide your own fate, whether becoming the savior of Tamriel or being a petty bandit, it's totally up to you!\n\nOkay, aestethically, it doesn't look pretty impressive by today's standards (well obviously, being a game made from 2003). They did gave it a try on giving water movements and its' damp, tropical enviroment can be felt from looking the meshes and textures. It's pretty good as well. Sound, it's a bit too random (e.g. when fighting some creatures that uses bites for attacks, it sounds like you were punched, and if it missed, it's like missing a thrust/blow). The music in this game is a bit more memorable than the other successors ,because ambience, dungeon, and towns used the same set of music all over again.\n\nCompared to the other successors of the game, TES4 and Skyrim, this game is FAR more immersive than the 2 of them. For example, we're talking about marksman weapons. Morrowind has everything (both thrown and archery weapons exists, which made the game's universe is a bit inconsistent, but it is a good idea after all). Next, fatigue/stamina bar (green bar) affects most of your actions, such as lockpicking, hitting stuffs, casting spells. And a Mount and Blade-ish combat styles (directions affect the damage of your weapons, such as katanas deal better damage  when swung sidewards, etc). And yeah, you would not be able to freely roam like in both skyrim and oblivion (fast travel), so, backtracking is a running theme on the game. Please do note that NPCs has fixed levels and items (meaning that you can get a full set of the best armor ingame, while being a low level character).\n\nTL;DR here are some pros and cons:\n\n+ Immersive world\n+ Decent graphics for its' time\n+ Many weapon types and variants (broadswords, spears, halberds, axes)\n+ You can basically do whatever you want (ignoring the main quest and killing essential NPCs)\n\n- Imbalanced (fixed levels, making early game really tough to get through on some classes)\n- Primitive combat system (still using the dodge factor, despite being an FPS RPG)\n\nThis is my final verdict for this game,\n8.5/10\n\nOverall, it's a good game for any diehard TES fans and dont mind a little challenge from outrageously hard enemies.\n\nbongvox","August 21, 2015","true","82.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

True Flame best sword in Elder Scrolls. The fact they have a huge diversity of weapons, armor, clothing and magic means it is the best as well.

Sure, there are a lot of features that Skyrim and Oblivion players would be lost without (such as the compass), but it is still a fun medieval fantasy RPG.\nAlso, I highly encourage you to check out the mods for this game.

Don't like fast travel? This is your game! Also be warned if you think the hit detection is off, well its not, your skill is just too low. I like Morrowind but oblivion really polished off the rough edges. I mean if you aim an arrow point blank at someone and still miss, really? Skyrim is a completely diffrent game than Marrowind so if you are coming from skyrim you probably wont like this game. Its really an emersive experience but its hard try playing on normal (0) setting its HARD. I dont like playing games on anything less than norma but my god! I beat this game on the xbox and picked it up on steam and its really slow paced the monsters dont level with you so you cant just go where you please. Which can be good or bad depending on your perspective. If you play a thief you can acquire glass weapons right off the bat! Old school rpg rules apply talk to everyone get advice and little secrets!!! Stock up on potions and be prepared to die (save a lot)!!!! Nastolgic YES! Can't say its for the new comers to rpg's lets face it skyrim brought a lot of new fans that otherwise wouldn't touch the genre if this is you buy when its super cheap cuz you probably wont like it!

I know already what it is like. This is a game that for half of the game you will have no idea what you are doing. It is amazing. You feel like the charactor. Your confused, there is NO hand holding, you have to explore and live off the things you find, you will need to follow vague directions. It is very immersive and they did a great job of making it beliveable. In the begining of the game you can't even kill a mudcrab. Your charactor is pathetic, but then..... You start to relaize you are walking faster, A LOT faster, you arent missing every swing of your sword, you are become awesome. I bought this game and didn't really play it because it seemed too grindy., but WOW was I wrong not to play it. IF  you can get past the old graphics and grindy gameplay, you will not be dissapointed. (If you are prone to rage quiting don't play this game for it can be difficult)\n\n\n\nI do have one huge problem with this game, there is barely any voice acting, just simple phrases and the main storyline.

This classic jewel of a game is a must buy for MOST\nES fans out there. I emphasize *MOST* for there are a few things that would keep the veterans begging for more while other newer fans out there might be thrown off.\n\nTLDR Version:\nDiscover destiny in all it's glory as you become embroiled in politcs, war, and prophecy.\n\nPros:\n+Deep, meaningful storyline\n+Exploration at it's best\n+Fully customizable character optimization\n+Very avid modding community\n+Jump across a continent within 5 minutes of gameplay!!!\n\nCons:\n-Combat isn't engaging for melee characters\n-Very weak graphics without mods\n-Not friendly to the unwary begginer\n-Some things are never explained and need a wiki\n\n9.5/10 BUY IT!! BUY IT!! BUY IT!!!\n\nLong Version\n\nQUick Backstory:\nYou are a prisoner on a boat headed for the island of Vvardenfell* for unknown reasons; but they must be important for the Emporer himself ordered your travel there. You are disturbed by foul dreams as a voice speaks to you and says you have been "chosen" and that the voice "will be watchful". You awaken on the boat to be dropped on your sorry ♥♥♥♥ in a small village, and are given orders by the local authorities to find a man named "Caius Cassades" and follow his orders to the letter. YOu will follow his orders to the letter and soon find yourself involved in disputes with a theocratic state, battle the forces of a living god, and discover Morrowind in all it's glory, prophecies, and destinies. But in the end, you carve your own destiny...\n\nMorrowind is the true ES game which expanded the influence and started ES on it's road to fame and recognition. This is because at the time it's graphics were good, tons to explore, and most importantly, it was the first ES game to port to a console and do it succesfully. It established standards for open-world games and earned itself "Game of the Year", and Bethesda celebrated that by re-releasing it at the time with 2 Expansion packs, eah with their own intrigueing stories and atmospheres. We are going to explore this game and why it is such a huge success and why it is a classic, but also why it might not appeal to newer fans of ES that started with things like ES IV or V*\n\nPros:\n\nStoryline\n\nThe story is well thought out and is deep and enaging, but also mysterious as well as intrigueing. Without spoling too much, the story consists of you following the story of the ancient dumner hero known as "Nerervar" and why he is so important to the native tribes of Vvardenfell as well as the people of the civilized part of the island. Your exploits soon discover  a secret cult, shrouded in mystery and dread, known as the "Sixth House", ans soon dsicover they have a lot more planned than the world even knows a the time. With these secretive and covert ops, you come to blows with the local religious establishment known as the "Tribunal Temple", which rules most of Morrowind through a merciful, but inquisitive, theocratic state. All of these factions are aware of prophecies of the acient island, and harbor dark secrets that are known to themselves and why they commit to their odd actions.\nThe background lore is solid, with many books and inside lore to fill the mind of the confused player who is embroiled within this conflict. You must persuade and threaten everyone from simple commoners to living gods to determine what the whole scheme of things is and to reveal the whole plot to the player.\n\nExploration\n\nFrom artifacts to mundane bonemeal, you almost never know what you will find in the next cave or tomb you enter a stupid cave with nothing, or you could find a secret daedric ruin within a tomb, and follow it's path to find a long and sought after artifact! Only you can wll yourself to explore, and is there a LOT to explore. There are som many dungeons, so many caves and tombs, that I havn't even foud everything, and i've played this game for YEARS.\n\nFully Customized Characters\n\nYour cosmetics might not be that open to possibilities, but the stats of your character are completley open to experiment with. FInd the best combinations, etermine your playstyle, which can be literally ANYTHING you could imagine. Unlike in ES IV and V, your playstyle is not pushed in a certatin direction. Nope; you can be a jumping, fireball throwing lunatic, a naked sneak-theif, a half- naked mage, you can play however you like.\n\nAvid Modding Commute\n\nEven though Ste.Wor.Sho.* doesn't support, their are 10,000's of mods out there for your choosing, from graphics to gameplay to sound and body mods, the mod community continues to thriveto this day. One mod that is essential, however, is the "Morrowind Code Patch" mod, which fixes many bugs and bad scripting that unfortunatly takes place in this game.\n\nJump Across a Continet in under 5 min. of Gameplay!\n\nPretty self explanatory, just go out of town and follow the path till you see a book on the ground and hear screams.\n\nCons\n\nMelee Combat\n\nMelee combat is sadly a joke in ES III. Everything is based off of chance, and so you can be swinging a battleaxe into someone's face, but if your skill is too low, you still won't hit, which can be rather immersion breaking.\n\nGraphics didn't age well\n\nTHis is an old game, and the graphics didn't age well at all. Bad polygon count, poor view range and bad lip synce plague this game. Many graphics mods change many of these features, however, and fix most problems quite nicely. Thank the mod community.\n\nBegginers Beware\n\nIf you don't know what you're doing, watch out, for yo will find yourself in the wrong cave fighting a level 30 monster who wants to rip your n*ts off. Just think carefully before you go anywhere to dangerous and don;t be afraid to run away if things get too rough.\n\nNeed a wiki?\n\nYes, even with it's deep, underlying story, some things are never explained in terms of quest objectives, what to do, as well as some lore issues, and some explanations as to where someone is. I presonally reccoment UESPWiki to help with many of your dilemas in this department.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, an ageless classic and well worth your time, for it lays down the doundations for many of the ground breaking features in later ES games, and introduces so many lore points tat willl you will be for more.\n","January 27, 2015","true","95.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The more I play the more I feel that I missed out all those times I played the other games, mostly Skyrim. The things that might be unlikeable in this game are easily fixed with mods like MGSO (Morrowind Graphics ad Sound Overhaul), a face and hair changer, and MCP (Morrowind Correction Patch, which includes many fixes and maybe much wanted features). Imagine playing skyrim, with slightly worse (but actually cool) graphics, more freedom, a prettier world, prettier art styles, more weapons, more creatures, a better cast of NPCs, more lore, and A STRIP CLUB! Its fantastic, and it is a game about learning and putting time into your choices. It won't be an experience where it's hack and slash all the way, but the combat is "click click click" as I've heard some people say. Dont let that give you the wrong idea. RNG isnt that bad in this game (players of DnD and that sort of game will understand), it's just that people overexagerate it. You also have to open your menu and consider spell choice and which magic items would work well in that situation. On the topic of magic, you can also make your own spells by combining others and use sliders to make it perfect for you (this goes the same for enchantments), so knock yourself out.\n\nTo put it simply, it is a colorful, free choice world where you LIVE and dont PLAY.\n\n11/10 would do moon sugar again","November 23, 2015","true","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay wise it's not bad.  I feels like the weapons and armor you use give some personality to your play style, and there is a large array of weapons anddd armor.  I do especially like that there is no beginning mission that wastes 20-30 minutes every time you start a new game.  The world is most certainly a large and open land just waiting to be discovered.  But I can't praise this game with the problems that you do face, and all the things I mentioned already do have some problems within the good.\n\nThe world, while expansive, feels confined to the path that is presented to you.  It never feels like you can go off the path, which makes all the area in between towns feel very dull and hollow.  Everytime that I came across a dungeon or a cave I would feel this overwelming joy of discovery, that would soon be lost seeing as all the dungeons are small, especially for the small amount of them there even are.  The combat is not very good because you hardly ever hit the target unless you are in their face and then you might just land a hit, and I am pretty sure that each hit only deals damage if you have some stamina which takes for ever to recharge.  The controls are the worst seeing as each button has a seperate funtion, which means you'll have about thirty keys in use for every thing and often get lost in your keyboard.  This also most definitly ties into the iffy combat.\n\nThe functions and game modes that are in Morrowind are as expected, the open world and beautiful (I'll be it polygonal) that are home to your custom avatar, but the game does also have a very nice soundtrack.  Every track is full of magic and wonder that gets you in the mood for an adventure, and they melt from note to note perfectly, ESPECIALLY the opening theme.\n\nI usually would make a section for the basic layout of the story here, but the beauty of this game is that it gives you no story, which leaves you to do everything that YOU want to do.\n\nThis game would be perfect in my opinion if all the problems with the controls where fixed and there were maybe a few more dungeons, but everytime that I load up this game, I hear that theme and I makes me calm and ready for any challenges that face my way.\nSo in conclusion, my final rating for this game is a 6/10, probably 10/10 if not for so many problems.","December 18, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It welcomed me back with open arms and a smile, as I have left it to play its newer arrivals. gave it a facelift with the textures and sound packs and other improvement mods and addons, looks excellent. Don't get me wrong, I like Oblivion and Skyrim a lot. But Morrowind has its own special feel, Like I am at home., Know where I am goin.\nDo yourself a favor, Buy this! add some of the improvements to the game, you can get it to look a lot like skyrim.","June 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best way I could describe Morrowind's combat is that it is similar to most JRPGs, but in first person and in real-time. When you first pick up this game, I assure you that you will hate its combat. Don't give up on it. As you progress through the game, raising your skills and getting better gear, it will get easier. Eventually it will make perfect sense.\n\nAs for the story, I loved it. It was interesting throughout the whole thing and the Tribunal DLC quest line is a great compliment to it. I would highly recommend finishing the main quest, then Tribunal, then Bloodmoon. Tribunal acts as a sort of epilogue to the main story. Bloodmoon doesn't relate to the main story much at all, but it gets hard quick.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9.5/10","July 4, 2015","true","103.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game will start out slow but gets much more interesting later. Many Skyrim fans claim that "Skyrim is the best ES game ever!" but they haven't even played any other ES game... ? They looked at Morrowind pictures, but say "I refuse to play it because the graphics are bad." and yet they claim that Skyrim is way better that Morrowind. I don't get them. If they have played any other ES game it was Oblivion, which was a good game but probably not the best. Well, now that I come to think of it, they quit after an hour of "too bad of graphics.". There is no doubt this game is the best ever, great story, awesome mechanics, challenging, ingaging, millions of quest, so much loot, open world, makes your decisions impact the story (Unlike some other game I know) AND BEST CHARACTER CLASS CREATION EVER. So many possiblities with the customisable class, wheras Skyrim makes the whole game feel like a preset.

Unlike newer games in the series, this game is an old-school CRPG that pulls no punches; map markers are nonexistent, fast travel is only possible through in-game transportations systems (silt strider ports, mages guilds, boats, etc), almost every game mechanic is based on a 'dice roll' of sorts (this is why you'll miss nearly every sword swing in the beginning), and enemies/gear in no way scale to the player's level. Make no mistake, this is a game that will absolutely kick your ♥♥♥ for the first 10-15 hours on a first-time playthrough, but if you have the patience and are willing to invest a decent amount of time into your character build, I think you'll find an extremely rewarding experience at the heart of Morrowind.\n\nNote: I higly recommend using Morrowind Overhaul if you want to get the most out of your experience.

Morrowind allows freedom that the two games that followed just cant replicate. Spells, and enchanting bassically allow you to create things so powerfull, you would think it shouldnt even be allowed in the game, BUT, you can only achieve such things if you are smart enough to figure out how. Which brings me to my next point, everything in the game is layed out for you, the only things holding you back are skill levels. Once you get high enough levels, you can litterally make a spell to give you the abbility to fly, and shoot nukes at what ever the ♥♥♥♥ you want. You cant buy a house, but that doesnt mean you cant break into some dark elfs manor, kill him, and make his house your's. you can then drop your items where you want them to display them, tons of artifacts to collect. Bottom line, this game is very challenging, it sepparates the real gamers from the posers, the men from the children, It requires you to use youre head once, think about things, it doesnt force you to explore, it doesnt force you to talk to people, but if you dont, and you are lazy about it, this game will eat you alive, and you will be stuck. you literally have to LEARN.. you HAVE to learn, the lore, the skills, the weapons, the artifacts, the land, how to fight and survive. it makes the game very special, to me at the very least. You cant just bull ♥♥♥♥ your way through, quests are hard, there are no quest markers, dialouge is all text based. if you kill the wrong person you can doom the world which makes it impposible for you to finish the game or complete certain quests. the sad thing is, that its hard to get into this game these days, the graphics are dated for sure, the combat has some major flaws..  but if you can get past that, this game truely is brilliant, its fantastic, its simply more than words can describe. there is so much content, that im not sure any single person on this planet knows every little thing of information, item, or quest. If you think you can handle all of that.. then buy it, dont think, just do it. Oblivion, and Skyrim wouldnt exsist if this game wasnt so incredible, thats a fact.\n\nEdit: i will note that i only have 13 hours in this game on steam, but all of my play time comes from xbox when it was first ported. i was also only in 7th and 8th grade when i spent all my time playing this game.","October 19, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Down from the sky, some flying lizard stabbed me with its tail and I was done.\n\nI've been hooked ever since.\n\nDon't be fooled--- I have thousands of hours invested in this game, having played it on-and-off since I first got it for Christmas in 2003 on xbox; from xbox to pc-cd, then to Steam. It has held up as my favorite game of all time.\n\nMorrowind--- more specifically Vvardenfell--- is a strange and unforgiving world; you will spend many frustrating hours just trying to figure it all out, and many more before the feeling comes that this place is just as much your home as it is theirs.\n\nIf you don't know what you're doing, this is the most difficult game you'll find. If you do know what you're doing, it's the easiest--- and still the most fun.\n\nYes, there are balancing issues, yes there are exploitable features (not counting glitches, but the mechanic itself) and yes there are ways of becoming "overpowered." And I still enjoy myself all these years later finding ways to make myself unstoppable in record time or wealthy beyond measure at level one; or pushing it as far as it can go late game.\n\nThe combat has also been criticized (my brothers are always making fun of the corny woosh sound of my weapon "missing" even though it clearly made contact with the enemy). I found the combat logic of Morrowind rewarding with the satisfaction of learning how to use a class of weapon you've been wanting to try out--- especially at a higher level when you think you've seen it all. One moment you've pigeon-holed yourself into sword play, useless with anything else, train your blunt a bit, and suddenly you're knocking enemies to the floor with Veloth's Judgment.\n\nBut enough defending what noobs protest--- onto Morrowind's irrefutable triumphs.\n\nThe game's story is as beautiful, captivating and imaginative as the world in which it's told. A dark medieval fantasy infused with the steampunk footprint of the long-gone Dwemer, dipped in the mire of orwellian despondency, and injected with lovecraftian nightmares, Morrowind is a serious and brutal world (even though the story's more violent details are tastefully entrusted to suggestion).\n\nThere is a prophesy that foretells of a person born of certain conditions who will bring peace to a troubled land. The people of Morrowind took these prophesies seriously. The empire chose to exploit this by finding someone who fit the prophesy to send to Morrowind and act as a spy. You assume the role of the person the empire chose, releasing you from prison into this strange land for this very purpose. Your undertstanding is that you are a spy playing a dummy prophet, pretending to be the reincarnation of an old saint. Then you start to experience dreams and visions: the villain behind the nightmares plaguing Morrowind begins to talk to you as if he knows you.\n\nThe Great Houses of Morrowind bring more personality into the backstory and politics of the world. House Telvanni, the bitter geniuses who sit jealously in their towers, as madly hateful of the world as of one another; the noble Redoran, whose corruption-sprinkled house of nobility stands on the brink of elimination by the madness that surrounds them; the deceitful House Hlaalu, whose grip on Morrowind grows stronger through their influence with the controversial imperial presence. In all this, certain characters stick out of course, but the way they all mesh makes each house a riot in their own way.\n\nVivec and King Helseth rival Robert House and Mike Toreno as some of the best characters in gaming. Their inextricable complexity and seductive mysteriousness take you by the hand and pull you into their world, into their ways of surviving it.\n\nFrom the moment you step off the boat, you start to taste the flavor of the land. In your starting town of Seyda Neen (wherein I suggest you hang around for the first hour or so), you realize the rivalries and conflicts, the bitterness and xenophobia of a turbulent and backward country.\n\nOne "issue" that the modding community was quick to "remedy" was the claustrophobic view distance. It took me some years, but I've come to regard this restriction imposed out of necessity as a complement to the atmosphere.\n\nWhen exploring the hostile wastelands of Molag Amur and Red Mountain, you cannot see the oceans or the pleasant greenlands in the distance; this not only tricks the mind into making you think you are a lot further from home than you are, but often makes you lose all sense of direction, leaning more on your compass. It makes the world feel bigger.\n\nStraight magicka use in combat is for the most part obsolete, to put it kindly. It's good to know some cure spells and the intervention collection (including Mark and Recall) so as not to have to carry them in potions and items; maybe a few destruction spells for the rats and worms at level one and two when the sparksword you picked off the crazy flying wood elf keeps failing to connect. Enchanting items (or hell, the enchanted items already available) will quickly dispel any habit of fighting with your magicka pool.\n\nTo me, Morrowind's only major setback has been the AI. Were that improved to the point where NPCs could do anything the player can do (including jump), and included all the dynamics of Radiant AI, I would have never needed Oblivion or Skyrim.\n\nIn a word, Morrowind is the best-written story, most imaginatively-constructed and thought-provoking world, and the best game ever made.","July 18, 2015","true","65.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite these flaws, the game delivers an outstanding atmosphere and immersion. The background and lore are rich and not only that they are actually interesting. I cared about Vvardenfell and the Dunmer when I played this game. I cared about the inner politics of the Mages Guild and House Redoran.

Gameplay wise it's not bad.  I feels like the weapons and armor you use give some personality to your play style, and there is a large array of weapons anddd armor.  I do especially like that there is no beginning mission that wastes 20-30 minutes every time you start a new game.  The world is most certainly a large and open land just waiting to be discovered.  But I can't praise this game with the problems that you do face, and all the things I mentioned already do have some problems within the good.\n\nThe world, while expansive, feels confined to the path that is presented to you.  It never feels like you can go off the path, which makes all the area in between towns feel very dull and hollow.  Everytime that I came across a dungeon or a cave I would feel this overwelming joy of discovery, that would soon be lost seeing as all the dungeons are small, especially for the small amount of them there even are.  The combat is not very good because you hardly ever hit the target unless you are in their face and then you might just land a hit, and I am pretty sure that each hit only deals damage if you have some stamina which takes for ever to recharge.  The controls are the worst seeing as each button has a seperate funtion, which means you'll have about thirty keys in use for every thing and often get lost in your keyboard.  This also most definitly ties into the iffy combat.\n\nThe functions and game modes that are in Morrowind are as expected, the open world and beautiful (I'll be it polygonal) that are home to your custom avatar, but the game does also have a very nice soundtrack.  Every track is full of magic and wonder that gets you in the mood for an adventure, and they melt from note to note perfectly, ESPECIALLY the opening theme.\n\nI usually would make a section for the basic layout of the story here, but the beauty of this game is that it gives you no story, which leaves you to do everything that YOU want to do.\n\nThis game would be perfect in my opinion if all the problems with the controls where fixed and there were maybe a few more dungeons, but everytime that I load up this game, I hear that theme and I makes me calm and ready for any challenges that face my way.\nSo in conclusion, my final rating for this game is a 6/10, probably 10/10 if not for so many problems.","December 18, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not going to judge the entire game from its graphic though.\nGameplay... Confusing. Very. I picked a few skills at the beginning, picked up a sword and couldn't even hit the enemy. Because apparently I needed skill in sword to be able to deal damage. Ok. Weird.\nSpells are highly confusing.\nTraveling is also annoying. Slow, and no fast travel, and it looks so similar it's easy to get lost.\nQuests, oh god. No quest markers. NO QUEST MARKERS. You have to find your goal completely by reading things like "Go to the club at the north side of the city and turn right and go up the stairs then go left and go up those stairs and follow the water and up a hill and there is a house you need to enter"\nI spent hours trying to find a house for a quest!

It can be difficult at early levels, but honestly, there's nothing too hard about it. A lot of problems that new players find have simple solutions.\nThink movement is too slow? Go with Sign of the Steed.\nCan't hit anything? Stop running around near monsters. Slow down. Or pick Sign of the Lady for the +25 Agility, or Warrior for the all-around attack boost. Or make sure your racial weapon bonuses and class bonuses line up with your weapon.\nStill having trouble with Stamina? Amulets of Stamina are pretty easy to find once you get to Balmora. Just visit the enchanter in the Mage's Guild, or spend some pocket change hopping between the guilds until you find one.\nIs money getting you down? Sell everything you find, do some quests. You'll have more than you know what to do with soon enough.\nGame crashes a lot? Save often, or get patches. Actually, do both. The Morrowind Code Patch is amazing, and saving often, in different slots, never hurt anyone.\n\nCan't fight off chains of Dark Brotherhood Assassins who keep interrupting your rest? You got me there. Those guys are pretty tough. Don't wander so far from civilization that you can't take some trips to Ebonheart after your first attack, I guess.\n\nEnemies to watch out for early on include ghosts (you will want silver or magic weapons for them), that mage in the newbie cave (he might kill you in 1 hit, often takes 2), and pretty much any enemies in dungeons that aren't in the starter area. Not all dungeons are like this, but save before you check out each one.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the game, you'll find that everything you do can be OP if you play your cards right. I've walked into Daedric ruins at level 2/3 and killed some of the high-level NPCs in there for really nice loot, like Ebony and Orcish armor. It took a lot of potions, but it was worth it. (Hint: save your game before you try some as inherently suicidal as this).\n\nFinal advice: save often. Especially if you like jumping.","February 6","true","146.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a game in which I never had any clue of what to do, but simply enjoyed screwing around. You can choose your own adventure; do you want to do missions? Be a thief and ♥♥♥♥ the system? Be a mage and kill everyone? In Morrowind it's fairly difficult to find out what to do, to be honest. I've found myself wandering around a whole lot, never following the questline due to difficulty (and my lack of english skills back when I was 9, when I mostly played this) so I went the easy way and cheated my way to the top. I became a mage that could kill literally the entire world in 1 spell (quite boring) but then decided to start over and become a skilled marksman and steal whatever I could, trying not to get caught but when I did, I killed the whole town.\n\nMorrowind is an extremely unforgiving game; you steal a loaf of bread and everyone in the world tries to kill you. It stimulates good behaviour but doesn't prevent you from breaking the rules. Morrowind is one of the best games I've ever played, still up to today, and it will permanently have a spot in my childhood memories.\n\ntl;dr: would recommend, 8/10 due to graphics and engine limitations","February 13","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Personally, I started the Elder Scrolls series at Oblivion and then went to Skyrim. I tried Morrowind after that and just couldn't get into it. Then, I got into a situation with work where I had a lot of time where I couldn't be with any of my friends when I got any time off. Fortunately, I had my PC with me. That's when I tried to just grind out Morrowind--mostly for the lore. I'm glad I did. Once I got past the first five levels or so, the game became exponentially more enjoyable. On all of my other start ups (I think there were three.), I just couldn't get too far because I would get so frustrated with how bad the combat was and how long it took to get from place to place. If you can get a few levels in and get lucky on finding some decent gear early on, I guarantee you that you'll start to enjoy this game more. If you are hungry for a little Elder Scrolls lore and haven't ever taken the time to try out Morrowind, that is my advice to you. Grind through the first few levels. It gets better.","February 13","true","57.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Morrowind is just like Skyrim, except its not trash. Although I hate to blame it on "casuals", casualization was the Elder Scrolls downfall, but Morrowind was before this. It is a much better game and story.\n\nTo start off the gameplay. The combat and other parts of gameplay. follows an attribute and skill system like many other RPG's that take elements from D&D. You will be using these to go through Morrowind. Morrowind is a place is much like Skyrim, except its not trash. The enviornment of Morrowind is much more diverse than that of the next two Elder Scrolls games. The quests you will be doing will also have better writing and will take place in a variety of locations that aren't random cave in the ground where you will either fight draugr or bandits over and over again. Along with quests, Morrowind still holds the journal system in tact. There is no compass to guide so you will have to use the words people tell you and what is written down in the journal as you go to guide you. This is a much better element if you wish to immerse yourself in an RPG, BUT Morrowind isn't perfect and the further you go in the more cluttered your journal will become. This will only be remedied if you have the Tribunal expansion which will give you a better way of navigating through it. Morrowind has a fast-travel method similiar to Skyrim, except its not trash (to be fair though, Oblivion started it). You will pay for transport between major cities, and this will be your only method of major travel. This will not break immersion like fast travel does. What WILL break the immersion however is the AI. Although the writing is much better then the games to come, Morrowind will still suffer with not so intelligent artificial intelligence, in which NPCs will spout copypaste dialouge and will do very unnatural things. Horrifying really. Going back to combat, Morrowind has combat just like Skyrim, which at times WILL be trash. Morrowind has a weapon proficiency system which will determine how accurate you are with your weapon. At the beginning it will be dreadful, if you wish to try something new later on, it will be worse.\n\nAs far as Bethesda games go, this is their best game they've made in my opinion, so good on you Todd. The game is the most RPG like RPG they've made and hasn't been casualized, which would remove the more intricate and longer parts of the games to appeal to a larger audience. The game has a few flaws which can be fixed with mods, BUT if a game needs mods to be good, its not necessarily a good game then. Fortunately, Morrowind IS a good game and even without mods, its pros will give a great experience and its flaws and be annoying but will not ruin the game.","February 14","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you want to truly understand the world around you in this game then you'll not be disappointed, it's one of the most expansive stories ever told in any game that I've played.\n\nI will admit, the combat side of things is on something crazy, it's infuriating at times. If you're one to just run around and killing various people/creatures and have no intentions beyond stabby-stabby/shooty-shooty, avoid this game. That doesn't make it a bad game though, in fact it says so much about this game that it can be hailed as one of the best games ever, an icon of its time, despite the fact you can stab some prick in a cave eight times in a row and not damage it in the slightest.\n\nAnd damn does this game actually take time, you can't get off the boat with the only weapon you have being your ♥♥♥♥♥ and then end up punching an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with god-like powers just a few hours later. I explored a nearby cave about three hours into the game and got lit up by some necromancer.\n\nBloody hell I love this game. Invest in it, immerse yourself in its story, love the hilariously weird graphics and never look back.","February 29","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game doesn't hold your hand like Skyrim and Oblivion does. It makes you think and you need to be smart to have a good time in this game. Definitely not for casual gamers. Only bad thing is how outdated the game is. If you are playing this for the first time I reccomend downloading the 3.0 overhaul and if you are a returning player, I reccomend atleast a 1080p mod since it only goes up to 720p(I think). It is a VERY good game and a nice pc port. 10/10","June 25, 2015","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The province of Vvardenfell awaits, full of its enigmatic people, the Dunmer (aka Dark Elves), from the Great Houses and the Temple to the nomadic Ashlander Clans, Vvardenfell has much to offer a traveller to its shores. Solstheim, a harsh unforgiving island to the north and Mournhold, capital of Morrowind. There are many things waiting to be discovered.

Not for those who hate reading, however, as there is lots of text dialogue throughout the game. Extremely immersive gameplay, although minor quests can get tedious (as there can be a lot of "courier" work).

This game is brutal, only get it if your alright with getting screwed over many times for some satasfaction in the end.  Its not Skyrim or Oblivian.

Don't Adventure TOO much.  Steal stuff to make money.  Don't ♥♥♥♥ people off, it might just be me but I have been attacked by the Dark Brotherhood many times  (Sell their gear).

Whoops couldn't tell) and the story just sucks you in. With a plethora of mods available, you can get textures, models, whole landscapes, lighting, water, and even sounds up to the standard of recently released games.
