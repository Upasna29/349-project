Also only used controller which worked fine unless it timed out, causing it to de-sync.\n\nSTORY\n\n- Served it's purpose, but unless you have the hots for the history of the Crusades then you'll probably shrug it off like I did and get confused as they jump around locations (they give some historical information during certain cutscenes but I can't say whether it is accurate or fiction for the game).\n\n-Voice acting ranges from decent to awful.\n\nCOMBAT\n\n- Has a little more depth than most hack n' slashers with the numerous weapon combinations with their own different moves and animations (including gory and visceral finishers) Just mashing works well but it is methodical and not fast paced.\n\n-Enemies highlight briefly before they attack, and hitting the block button at that time deflects it. As the game progresses the enemies acquire armor and can deflect your attacks so you may be whacking them a lot longer than you'd want to unless you freely use the curse power.\n\n- Someone mentioned annoying QTEs, which I'll admit are a little obtrusive but not as bad as they claim. They do not appear during combat unless you are stunned or fighting against a couple bosses, and during regular play most of them as partner actions (like opening a door or boosting onto a ledge) and are not timed.\n\nFLAWS\n\n- Biggest is the checkpoint system, sometimes they're right where you expect them to be after each section, other times you have to restart the whole level after progressing so far and dying. Especially bad in later levels when you get surrounded by multiple enemies that can deflect your attacks and stun you and you just can't block/counter fast enough (there is no dodge move)\n\n- SPOILER (maybe) game ends abruptly without a solid conclusion, and it's unlikely a sequel will come\n\n- Game crashed a couple of times but other than that I didn't find any noticeable bugs/glitches\n\n\nOverall it was enjoyable with co-op, but I don't think it would be worthwhile going solo. Probably best with a sale price.","February 25, 2014","true","14.3"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","45","54","0","3"

It's, actually, a great Hack N' Slash with decent graphics, entertaining story and amazing gameplay.\nPerhaps 20 bucks might be expensive for some people, because it's not a very long game. But, it's amazing playing Local Co-Op or via Internet.\nThe graphics are not so bad, considering that it's an indie game and was released almost 3 years ago. The curse part is just great. It's pretty interesting to enter that realm of hell and fight spirits and dead men alike, and use the great powers of purification.\nThe sad part is that the game has a couple of issues and bugs. Nothing to worry about. But, you may encounter a couple of glitches along your playthrough.\n\nShould you buy this game? Absolutely.\nShould you buy it at full price? Well, that depends if you really want it or if you can wait until it's on sale. But, I've seen it on sale just a couple of times.\nWhat calification I would give to it? Well, I really liked this game. For me, it would be 8/10. But, I'll let you to be the judge of that. So, if you have the money, give it a chance. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.","August 1, 2014","true","24.1"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","0"

This was challenging and a good bit of fun. Cut and smash as you fight your way to remove the curse and find the holy relics before your enemies.\n\nThe 'finishing moves' are great but can become boring after a while depending on what you have unlocked for each weapon. The difficulty can spike way up at times with no reasoning at all. Enemies you could kill in a few hits just seconds ago are now four times stronger. However with a little patiences and planning this can be over come.\n\nSome bugs and glitches but most were pretty funny and never caused the game to become broken and/or unplayable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/recommended/106000/","matseb2611","White Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/","317 products in account","Cursed Crusade is a 3rd person hack and slash taking place during the Fourth Crusade in history and follows a story of Denz, a templar who set out to find his father who hasn't returned from a previous crusade, and Esteban, a mercenary who is always after gold but gets mixed up in the crusades and becomes Denz' best friend.\n\nThe game spans a few dozen of missions in various locations of the world. The missions for the most part just require you to participate in sieges and battles, and are mostly combat-oriented. Some of the battle scenes are executed really well and feel epic in my opinion. A few of the missions here and there do something different, like have a boss fight or find yourself in a nightmare where you learn new powers.\n\nTo me the best part of the game is the combat. It's fun, rich, and visceral. You can choose to use any weapon combination ranging from maces, to axes, swords, and even spears. You can use a weapon as stand alone, or you can dual wield, or wield it with a shield. There are some two-handed weapons too. Each weapon stance has its own unique moves and unique executions. In addition, weapons can break during combat, so you often have to change what you use as you pick up new stuff from fallen enemies. Sometimes this mechanic can be a tad annoying, but it makes sense in the context of the game and at least encourages you to try out new weapon combinations.\n\nYou learn new moves and improve your attributes after completing missions. At the end of each mission you earn Victory Points. There's a default amount for each mission, but many also can grant you bonus points if you've done secondary objectives such as found all the coffers or purified a crucifix.\n\nThe combat also features a curse mode. When the player enters curse mode, the environment around them turns all fiery akin to hell, they become stronger and fight more effectively, they can use fire spells, and they also find weakspots in walls and other structures, which they can smash to make a new doorway.\n\nAdmittedly the game is heavily combat-focused. So if you're expecting platforming or other types of gameplay, you won't find them here, aside from occasional first person shooting with a crossbow. I don't personally mind this too much, as platforming wouldn't make sense in this game. Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is very heavy on cutscenes, some of which can be lengthy.\n\nThe story felt so-so. It starts off on a promising note with some good chemistry between the two main protagonists who quickly become best friends, and the antagonist seeming very charismatic and perhaps even noble to a degree, but in the second half the story starts going vastly downhill. The plot feels very unfocused, with no build up to climax. Just very random events happening. The antagonist becomes a 2-dimensional cartoon villain who wants evil for the sake of evil. And the ending does not resolve anything at all and feels very abrupt, as though the story was cut at a midpoint.\n\nOverall the game is definitely worth trying out. I think most of the critic reviews are way too harsh on it and the game is not as bad as most of them make it out to be. Sure, it has some strange hiccups here and there, like the annoying quick-time event in the very first mission where you have to escape Death (honestly, don't give up on the game at this point; this part is the hardest part of the game if I am honest). But in general I can't deny that I've had fun playing it and I think anyone who is up for a nice story-driven hack and slash should enjoy it.\n\nA couple of last notes:\n\n1) The game can also be played co-op with a friend. I've not tried it myself, but since the two main protagonists are always together, I believe the game was made with co-op aspect in mind from the very start.\n\n2) I would highly advise to play with a gamepad, as the controls for it seem much better and more intuitive than with M&K.","March 9","true","11.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

The two characters go through what can only be called a Mideival Buddy Cop Movie-like story, with the two working together as if they'd been "on the force" for years and it's just another day on the job.\n\nThe combat's rather well done; fluid and easily manuverable, and it has some rather neat combos that are centered in (mostly) reality, and while your character can wield any weapon in the game, they're not experienced in every weapon, and so you can actually train (to a degree) just how well your character can use weapons, and which you prefer. Because of this, however, you can also nick the weapons off of your slain enemies or even from walls where they're set in armories. Which is necessary, because all of your weapons, armor and shields can (and will) break due to wear and tear.\n\nThe game can be a bit weird at time with camera angles and some wonky movements when the camera shifts suddenly, but overall the game is a fun, enjoyable mideival party. And while it's obviously meant for, and would be fun with, two players, the single player alone works just fine, and is built in such a way that a co-op partner can hop in whenever. Thankfully, the AI that controls your co-op partner is intelligent and dependable.","January 31, 2014","true","4.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Had some fun while was at it. I used keyboard and mouse, so my opinion can be biased.\n\nI will suggest you try this game when it's on sell. It has nice graphics and exciting fighting mechenics. It's main selling point is in the fighting. It falls short in replayability due to its linear story progession. Unlock weapon combos is nice, but once you finish the game you might not have the motivation to start again. Story lacks some depth, and enemy design is quite generic. But you will enjoy the fights while you are in the moment especially when facing against multiple enemies. I give it a score of 7/10, its not a game that will keep you up late into the night.\n\nFollowing is the detailed breakdown of my gameplay experience:\nGraphics:\nOverall the game is greatly optimized, there are no lags even when hoards of enemies are on screen. Graphic quality is not bad, not much to complain about. Environment texture could use a bit more work, some came out pixelated, character models are done decently though, they have great details. Lighting is beautiful.\n\nAnimation:\nAnimations have varying quality. Combat animations are nice, especially when you perform your combos correctly and end with a finishing move. But cut scene animations have funny bobbing movements to every act. They probably motion captured but didn't smooth out the keyframes. There is absolutely no facial expressions (or just one). Mouths move in good sync, but you can't see any emotions whatsoever.\n\nCamera:\nCamera system is a mess. Free chase cam is totally insensitive, you want to change angle but it just doesn't do it fast enough, especially when you are fighting multiple enemies at the same time. Some areas will automatically switch to a fixed camera or a far away camera, they were also placed at the worst positions possible. Some even are behind trees that block your view you can't see a thing (they should have make obstructions transparent). Some far away cams are so far away that you can't really see what is going on.\n\nCombat system:\nWay too many combos. You can't possibly remember them all, and you cannot check the combo list mid game so you end up not able to practice them unless you write them all down on piece of paper. Best way is to just unlock the longest  combo streak for each weapon type then just mash your buttons away. Battle mechanics not bad, counter and dodge moves keep your fingers busy and game pace relatively exciting.\n\nRanged weapon:\nHorrible aiming controls. The crosshair will move a chunk of space at a time, if you are good at counter-strike kinda game, you might break your mouse in frustration. Appearantly there is a auto-function when you hold shift while aiming, but i only discovered 2 chapters before the final mission. The "duck and shoot" part of the game feels like a Mario Party mini-game. I guess it's added to give the game some variaty, but i rather hoped ranged combat was not included in the game at all..\n\nCurse:\nHonestly, entering curse mode just gives you a slight advantage over enemies (faster attack speed and fire spells). It feels like a gimmik to make the graphics cool, but the implementation gives  no variability to gameplay. It doesn't give any complementing elements to the story either. Sometimes it bugs out too, and leaves objects on fire when you exit the curse mode lol..","November 2, 2014","true","11.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andersgeek/recommended/106000/","andersgeek","jello ツ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andersgeek/","3706 products in account","Man, this game is a slog. You don’t want to play it. Believe me. It’s so badly designed on so many levels. It doesn’t even have a proper end. Yet, when you play, it is oddly compelling -- just to see whether you can beat it, or it’s going beat you. Still, don’t. Just don’t. For your sanity’s sake.\n\nBut one thing at a time… ‘The Cursed Crusade’ is a hack-and-slasher set during the time of, you guessed it, the Crusades. Which one(s) exactly isn’t exactly established. Or rather, if it is, the game’s throwing everything and anything related to the Crusades into a mixer, anyway. Jumps in time and locales make following the game’s time-line pretty hard to impossible. The story is about Denz, son of and himself a Templar, who is trying to break a family curse. Although, it’s more of an “everyone’s cursed, anyway, not just this particular family” deal. He’s hired to fight in the Crusades where he befriends Esteban, and hence the hacking and slashing can commence.\n\nGameplay-wise, it’s basic hack-and-slashing with forced Bro-op sequences, a buttload of QTEs, and crossbow shooting for good measure. The titular Curse offers little to enhance the experience, except maybe even more QTEs.\nEnemies level up with you, meaning you have to flail at them several times in always the same way. It gets annoying instead of challenging rather fast. The levels are oftentimes irritatingly designed, very much not helped by forced camera angles. There’s even one level that is entirely played like a 2D brawler, for some reason. I could see this working as some kind of reference to The Olden Days™, but, really, the game is trying to take itself too serious. Incidentally, it’s failing at that, too, with stonily delivered references to the likes of Frank Miller’s/Zack Snyder’s ‘300’.\n\nTo top all this off, there’s exactly one female character in this game. Which, to be fair, could be justified with “It’s medieval war, for chrissake! There were no women”. Yet, when said female character is introduced -- she doesn’t even have a speaking role, but is mute instead.\n\nIf all this doesn’t throw you off already and you still want to play it because you want to hunt for achievements, be warned that the fighting system’s flaws make it a chore and ordeal to beat the game in Nightmare mode [the hardest difficulty].\n\nThere’s one really good thing, though: The levelling system. Pieces upon pieces are added to your armour when levelling up, and hundreds of different -- and rather brutal -- moves can be unlocked for the myriad of weapons/combinations. There is something compelling hidden under all the other bad decisions, which is sadly not brought to its full potential.","November 26, 2013","false","18.6"," 43 of 84 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","43","84","0","2"

But every combination of those weapons leads to a new skill tree with a ton of unlockable moves(so for example, a one handed sword has one skill set, you can dual wield swords for a different skill set, a sword and shield is another skill set, sword and axe, etc etc)\n\n-combat system also includes parries and guard breaks, tha the enemies will use against you as much as you use it against them.\n\n-weapons break mid combat, but there are always tons of new weapons too pick up so you are never empty handed, this is cool because it encourages you to master new weapon styles and keeps the combat constantly interesting.\n\n-brutal finishing moves, unique to every weapon and every combination of weapons.  These finishers are some of the coolest I have seen in a game and make every kill very satisfying,\n\n-good story, this may be a con depending on your preferences.  There are cutscenes before and after every mission.  The game is well written and the voice acting is great.  If you're not into story, you can always skip the cutscenes.\n\n-co-op, although I did not play the game co-op, the option is there and this is a great co-op game.  If you choose to play solo, your AI partner is far more competant than you would expect, a nice change of pace from the brain dead AI that litters so many games like this.\n\n-lots of pickups on every level, each level has hidden souls, chests and a crucifix to purify.  Finding these grant you more points to upgrade your weapon skill trees, not necessary, but I did have fun combing the levels looking for them.\n\n-fairly tough enemies-one on one you should be able to take down anything, but once 2 or more guys start attacking you need to be on your toes.\n\ncons:\n\n-the story just ends, I wont spoil anything for you, except to tell you that there is a cliff hanger ending and I am reasonably sure there will not be a sequel.  When the credits started rolling all I can think was wtf just happened.\n\nOverall a very good, deep and strategic hack and slash.  Well worth the money, but just be warned that the story will never resolve.","December 12, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First game I've played where you can fight French, Hungarians, remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire, and demonic zombies.\n\nInteresting setting and story. You can tell the developers were on a budget though. I recommend this if on sale.","February 27, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good game without claiming to be something more.","March 19, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Naszym bohaterem jest młody templariusz Denz de Bayle, który dołączył do IV krucjaty by odnaleźć ojca. Towarzyszy mu najemnik Esteban Noviembre. Ciąży na nich klątwa templariuszy- moc która zwiększa szybkość, odporność i obrażenia w walce. Podczas krucjaty przyjdzie im sie zmierzyć z wieloma przeciwnikami   i w końcu z samą śmiercią, która chce zabrać ich przeklęte dusze. Gra daje nam duży wachlarz broni, możliwości korzystania z klątwy i brutalnych wykończeń wrogów. Jest to gra dla ludzi lubiących dużo akcji i przemocy. Serdecznie polecam.","June 19, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
