I've played a sizeable number of them since, but the ones that made the biggest impression on me were the ones where it's not all about the platforming, but really exploring the game and trying to figure out every single secret hidden in it. And secrets have become such a de facto standard of the mainstream 2D platformers to the point where the secrets and locations of them have become rather formulaic. The wonder of finding them has all but disappeared.\n\nThat's one of the reasons I love Knytt Underground so much. The fact that the world is so huge makes just getting around it a great endeavour in itself, but there's also so much stuff hidden under the surface if you care to dig into it. And it's mostly not about finding an equivalent to a star coin or a 1-Up, but rather about getting intimate with a game world that's so carefully and lovingly crafted. It's about talking to an NPC that isn't a step towards beating the game, but piecing together another part of the lore of the people of the underground. And it's about exploring amazing locations just for the sake of exploration; not because there's a carrot dangling at the end of your journey.\n\nIn short, this is probably my game of the year.","November 17, 2013","true","42.5"," 65 of 67 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","65","67","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/recommended/248190/","yellowlab","YellowLab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/","566 products in account","Knytt Underground is a 2D platform game of exploration with a quirky story. You play as Mi Sprocket who is a mute sprite. She is chosen to go on a quest (because her brother freaked out or something) to ring the six bells in order to prevent the world from being destroyed. Along the way she picks up two pixies who are her voice. Dora and Cilia couldn't be more polar opposite. One is kind and considerate. The other is brazen and brash.\n\nThe first two "Chapters" of the game are a kind of tutorial. The first shows you Mi. She can run and jump and climb. She also picks up colored lights and can activate them for a one time special power.\n\nThe second introduces you to Bob. Bob is a ball, and can bounce. Pretty high. He also can create a static field around him that will pull him to special robots to allow him to play Tarzan the ball.\n\nThis will take about 90 minutes. Then you get to meat of the game...Chapter three. The map in Chapter three is a rectangle 30 by 48 (1440) screens. Plus several secret areas not on the map including a small inverted world and you have a huge world to explore.\n\nThere are side quests to complete and some symbols hidden in what seem to be extremely inaccessible areas. There are other sprites and pixies around the world that tell a quirky story about some sprite "religions" having to do with technology.\n\nThe environments are unique. The different areas of the underground each come with different theme music. The part I liked best was trying to get items that seemed to be inaccessible. Many times you look at a screen and say "No way" can that item be picked up. Then you go through the game and learn some tricks that will allow you pick them up. The mapping system does a good job marking these items (i) as well as quests (Q) on your map.\n\nThere have been many discussions around the internet regarding the controls for this game. Personally, I didn't find them to be an issue. I have been playing games with a keyboard for a very long time. Arrows to move, "A" to use the special power, and "S" to switch between states. The only issues that I had were on some of the timing puzzles and pressing the wrong button (A instead of S). I thought keyboard controls worked well with the game.\n\nI would say to try the demo, but this only lets you play through the first chapter. While this will give you some feel for the game, the real meat and potatoes is in the third chapter. All I can say is I had a lot of fun exploring this game and having the story unfold.","June 28, 2014","true","27.7"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","1"

Knytt Underground looks like a small and cute trifle with nothing but a cool photo-collage backgrounds paired with primitive art-style and rather abstract jokes. And it ends with explosions, quite literally. Well, at least the author inserts himself into the game to tell you this in person. First two short chapters (out of three, mind you) don’t look like much. The player is introduced to the base mechanics, of which there aren't really a lot of: you can jump, climb any vertical wall, transform yourself into a big rubber ball (this particular one can be seen only in demo-level, which is included along first two chapters and has its complete separate level) and gain access to higher jumps. Occasionally you can collect a one-time-use-power-up which looks like glowing flower bud; and most of the time this “special ability” is nothing more than some fancy high jump or short free-fly-mode for getting where you couldn’t just climb up, because the wall isn’t completely even.\nSo I was ready to write it off with I a notion “I certainly understand why it’s so highly praised on indie scene, but…”. But then the third chapter happened. Forty minutes later, when I was realising in panic that I haven’t seen even 10% of the map and found a single save point, I realised I got into the rabbit hole; what I didn’t know is, that it would turn out to be a truly amazing adventure. The seem-to-be-obvious primary purpose of “just following the story” is being crushed by the enormous world size. You don’t really know the right path, there’s a lot of obstacles and, finally, the path to the story points is blocked by some treasure-hungry NPCs; so you have to wander off. And that’s where it becomes firstly mysterious, then great, and finally, near the end, obvious. You didn’t come here to just play it through. You’ve come here as a discoverer of sorts. The one that boldly steps into the unknown and makes a map of the journey; all this quite literally: the world is divided into a familiar grid of separate screens and there’s no telling what will you see in the next one for most of the time. The game also acknowledges this fact without a single doubt: formal purpose is what it is — formality, cause for an adventure.\nSo what did I discover here? I found a whole surrealistic underground world inhabited by sprites and fairies, who barely remember the history of this world, but call themselves strange names, like “The Internet”. They remember though the catastrophic events of war waged by humans, that ended with the world being reduced to these scattered survivors, living in ruins, holding mystic beliefs and treating leftover household items from pre-war times as magical powerful artefacts. And yet these folks have enough in them to give you a good reason for watching them in natural habitat, exploring their lives and getting from them pieces of history. It will never, though, become clear what really happened. You didn’t really expect that from a game, which literally is dedicated to uncertainty and meaning of seeming obscure final goal? Yep, that’s it, fourth wall is a regular punchbag here.\nAside from the cryptic story and chilling ambience of the scenery, there’s more too. The gameplay makes a sudden skyrocketing, shifting from “mindless jumping” to “carefully solving puzzles with jumps”; and not only with jumps. Rubber ball form now becomes useful not only for jumping higher, but for doing all kinds of tricks. Those simple power-ups now require planning before their usage. One wrong move — and at best you’ll have to try again, sometimes dying from contact with molten lava or not-so-friendly-robot laser beam. And that’s not worst that could happen, sometime you’ll fail so bad, you’ll fall to the other screen; getting back up isn’t an easy task for most of the time. But with enough focus and thinking you’ll get all those coins, and flowers, and keyboard keys, and maybe even some secret symbols. Even if you don’t it won’t change much; a game that is filled with secrets won’t hide that much if you won’t find all of them. After all, that was the message of it. If the goal isn’t clear, or doesn’t really make sense, it will be the false one.","September 9, 2014","true","13.7"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","2"

There so much to explore, and so many secrets to find, it's unbelievable. The story might seem a bit strange to begin with, but while you explore the giant world you'll find various pieces of lore that helps with the bigger picture.\n\nThe game builds around a very simple puzzle mechanic: you can switch between a girl that can jump and climb, and a ball that can bounce higher and move faster. This works very well, and you'll meet some smart puzzles throughout the game where this comes in good use.\n\nEven the art style is beautiful.

I've Put almost 100 hours into the PSN and DRM-Free releases, and I know I'll be playing through a fifth time with the Steam release. The reason I can return to this game so frequently without getting bored is the world. It's the biggest game of its kind, and every single area has recieved a genuinely impressive amount of care. The story might seem inconsequential at first, but it explores some very sensitive topics with sincerity and handles its subject matter well. After you've finished the story, there's piles of ultra-challenging bonus areas and secrets to explore, too. The whole package is finished off with one of the best soundtracks in video game history, period. You can find it free on the developer's website, and I suggest you do. It's five and a half hours of outright brilliance.  If exploring is your cup of tea, you should've picked it up when it first released last year.\n\nJust a side note. It might not seem like it, but the game really does deserve that M rating. It has some serious subject matter in it that I wouldn't reccommend for kids (or for that matter, some adults).","November 25, 2013","true","13.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","1"

At least, that's what she's doing if you listen to the angel on her shoulder; her shoulder devil is of another mind.\nIt's also about life after us. The little buggers who built their civilization on whatever garbage we left behind seem to be doing just fine, impending doom notwithstanding. Vexing, but hardly surprising.\n\nBut, at its heart, what Knytt Underground is really about is an impossibly large map.\nMan, that thing is big. There's about 1,500 screens in the main world, and there is even a little extra hidden beyond the boundaries.\n\nThis is not quite a metroidvania -- your "verbs" are limited to jumping, bouncing and the occasional single-use power-up used for the trickier platforming puzzles (firing one shot, double jump, limited flight ability). A lot of the Nifflas experience is going through vast areas with no real challenges, taking the scenery in. All the same, it's not just a stroll in the park: there are also tricky jumps, shortcuts and hidden passages galore. While your palette of actions is limited, the controls are tight enough that this is all doable on a keyboard.\n\nThe backgrounds in this game are pretty, even if they're mostly saturated pictures of nature. Character portraits are kind of goofy. As for the writing, it can be grating in an indie games kind of way, but it's just self-aware enough to land on the "charmingly quirky" end of the spectrum.\n\nBut again, this is a game about a map. A huge map. It beckons.\nIt's calling out to you.\n"... Heeeeey", it says.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NegativeZeroZ/recommended/248190/","NegativeZeroZ","MalikNZZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NegativeZeroZ/","184 products in account","The name of the game is secrets. Secrets Underground. That's what this is.\n\nNifflas, creator of the Knytt series, is a whimsical developer who just up and makes whatever he feels like making, usually a whimsical game about whimsical creatures going on whimsical adventures, and while Knytt Underground draws on that in its story and its visual and audio design, the characterization is a drastic change in tone. It handles serious and sensitive issues, and there's plenty of heavy language to go with that. Maybe it's the sheer unexpectedness of it that contributes to the M rating, whereas plenty of games with way more "questionable content" keep their T rating because their general tone is darker. But that's not what the game is about. The game is about secrets. The game has way more secrets than achievements. There are often secrets within the secrets. Sometimes there are even secrets in THOSE secrets. How about a 4-layer secret? Don't put it past Nifflas; he'd do it. Nothing is too obscure. Very few players get the achievements in this game, and it's for a reason. Even if you find them all, you could still be missing a lot. Fact: Nifflas hates progress bars.\n\nThe Knytt series is a bit of a Metroid "lite" with the emphasis on exploration and platforming challenges scattered throughout. Enemy encounters are infrequent, and they are not very aggressive, letting you take in the atmosphere even when they're around. Even more rarely will you actually have to confront the enemies, as most of the enemy-based challenges are about avoiding enemies or using them to your advantage. The biggest obstacles in the game are the NPCs, who are more than happy to make their living by setting up doors in the way of your goals and charging you in rare artifacts to open them. If you take this gameplay mechanic at face value, it can seem like the biggest gameplay element in Knytt Underground is a bunch of annoying fetch quests, but this is not necessarily true. Yes, if you've been staring at the map the whole time and heading straight toward your target destinations with no effort to explore on your own, you will be sent on fetch quests, but if you've been exploring adequately throughout your experience, very rarely will the NPCs actually succeed in making you turn around. The quests are also pretty lenient, as you don't have to find every item in the game to pay the tolls, and, in fact, you don't have to pay the tolls at all. If you're very skilled at navigating the world, you can find shortcuts around these annoying characters. The fetch quests aren't here to draw out the game length, they're there to offer a loosely guiding sense of purpose as you whimsically (there's that word again) explore the world and enjoy its atmosphere--just as how in Minecraft, the "goal" of taking out the Ender Dragon is not the main appeal of the game, and if that were all you ever set out to do, you'd be missing the point. This isn't the kind of game you want to try and plow through quickly. If you do, you're seriously missing out, and probably not having a very good time.\n\nThe information in the above paragraph does not mean that Knytt Underground is braindead easy, however. There are plenty of hidden challenges that will test your platforming mettle, no matter what your background is. The key word here, though, is "hidden." They are far from mandatory to advance the story, and not necessary to complete in order to enjoy the game. They are there because Nifflas gets bored and makes them, and hides them in the game so there's something for everyone.","January 28, 2014","true","20.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

The game is comprised of Three chapters, the first two are 30-45 minutes each and will leave you worried the game is going to be 2 hours long. Fear not. Chapter Three offers the vast Kyntt exploration we know and love.\n\nThat is to say, Kyntt is a Metroidvania exploration game without the normal character progression you'd normally see holding you back. Instead there are a number of clever puzzles that are challenging but shouldn't leave you frustrated (in my experience so far at least). Instead the game reigns you in through, first and foremost, a vast world that forces you to explore your local area or you'll miss much of the beauty of the game, but at the same time makes it extremely clear that you've reached a deadend on the map so you're not left wondering if you can make a jump or not.\n\nThe second way it gives you a sense of progression comes by letting you try things. In some instances it explicitly warns you not to until you know more about this or that and if you ignore the warning chances are you're going to fail unless you already know what you're doing. It's a nice way of developing the story and mechanics for first time players without forcing repeat players through lengthy tutorials.\n\nThat's the kind of game creator Nifflas is. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n\n(Also, he's make a lot of other games with Knytt and Ball.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuv_u/recommended/248190/","wuv_u","suu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuv_u/","264 products in account","tl;dr: Knytt Underground is a 10/10, it's amazingly detailed and has so much charm that it's practically oozing out. Brilliant Sound design, fitting music, intelligent dialogue, addictive gameplay, and a massive world to explore that's handled expertedly.\n\nI'm in love with this game, when I first got it I knew that I was going to love it. The sounds, the music, the backgrounds, the art, the gameplay, the characters, everything! It just feels so thought out like a giant complete puzzle. As such, I'll be going into detail about things that make this game great, and also replying to the most Popular Negative Reviews here on Steam.\n\nGameplay -- The most important thing in any game is of course how it plays. And Knytt Underground plays execellently. It's an entirely physics based platformer with neat power-ups that don't make you stronger, but instead allows you to navigate in different ways to get past obstacles. There's also a transformation that turns Mii Sprocket (The muted character you play as) to become a bouncey ball, where you can bounce up to high places. This transformation is entirely physics based, and it's damn accurate! It's very addictive.\n\nExploration -- Chapter 1 and 2 of the game are basically Introductions to the World, Tutorials, and the primary characters. Chapter 3 is where the training wheels are removed and you're allowed to freely explore an underground world of massive size with varying environments and hundreds, thousands of secrets to discover. There's even secrets in the main menu!\n\nThemes -- Probably the second most important thing in games, at least in my opinion. Here in Knytt Underground you have some pretty serious themes that you have to stop and think about, they also reflect the Modern World in a way or too. Religion, Atheism, Emotional trauma and finding happiness in the little things play a major key in the story and even gameplay in the form of quests. "Hey! You're that Sprocket Explorer kid, right? I don't suppose you could help me by going up into some dangerous caves to fetch me my dead Brother's skull? I need to complete his grave. He blew up, you see. In a nasty dangerous awful accident-- blah blah blah blah~" Dialogue is usually like that, except that you can reply, in an interesting way...\n\nArtistic Themes -- The literal themes of the game are very pretty, sometimes dark, and othertimes just bizarre. There's some characters who look like a Child drew them, othertimes there's characters who look batshote crazy, but each is charming in their own way. I love how there's basically zero limitations to the amount of characters you'll find. A weird monkey creature and can speak fluent English? Yup. A 6-inch high Ninja Warrior who wishes to kill you? Yup. A literal blob that's just chillin' around toxins? You bet'cha!\n\nDialogue -- There's hundreds of different and unique characters in Knytt with who you can interact with and even alter their futures, past sometimes as well! However, being the Mute Video-Game-Protagonist, you can't talk, you can certainly think, but never talk except for dreams. Instead you have to find two Fairies, a Moon Fairy called Cillia and a Sun Fairy called Dora. Their elements reflect their personalities. Cillia is dark, sarcastic, and down-to-earth, emotionally limited on the outside. Dora is the opposite, a bright optimist who's willing to give everyone a chance, but has a very dark past, and most likely a dark future. The dialogue for every character is usually really well written and is light-hearted at times, and dead-serious at other times. There's a secret where you find a Dead Body and you have to learn about the Dead Body's past, pretty grim stuff.\n\nInteractivity -- To interact with this world's characters, you must send out two of your fairies; Cilia and Dora. Black and White. Moon and Sun. Negative and Positive. So you're limited between being Negative and Positive with your response, very black and white. There's no middle line, no silver lining, no inbetween that you can pick. Instead the characters of the world which you interact with are the Grey between these two choices. There's no perfect person in the world of Knytt Underground, they are realistic with the fact that they have problems and personality traits unique to them. So it's up to you to decide how to deal with them. Your choice will affect other outcomes and Cilia and Dora themselves. Pick Dora too much and Cilia will feel like she's a third-wheel. Pick Cilia too much, and Dora won't think that you're too good of a person. Not even Cilia and Dora are perfect at what they represent, Dora can be mean, while Cilia can sometimes be nice. Very realistic and solid.\n\nSound Design and Design in general -- I'll start off with Design in general. There's no Main Menu, instead you play through the menu and enter different path ways, it can take up a little too much time, but it's very pretty to look at and is always a good way to prepare you for your saved game. Sound Design is brilliant! It's super crisp quality that's authentc from the sounds of waterfalls, to mechanical robots, to the sounds of magical chimes.\n\nStory -- I won't give away any spoilers, but you're an Explorer called Mi Sprocket of the Sprocket Family. You have been chosen to save the world by serving a Religion called Myriadism, where they believe in a God and have no respect for technology that was left over by Humans. Also forgot to mention that it's set after Humanity has killed itself, so the surface is a no-go, thus Knytt UNDERGROUND. Then there's the Internet, where they believe that the Human's technology is God-Like in design and activation, they value technology, but don't care too much about life of others. The Story is often interrupted and recapped to you by Nicklas, the developer and creator of the Knytt Series where he breaks the fourth-wall quite often. He's a really chill and cool guy in real life, and his personality and wall-breaking comments don't ruin the flow of the game.\n\nMusic -- The Musical Musicsky Musics of Knytt Underground are really relaxed and really fit well. There's a few songs which I dislike, but they did fit their environment. Some of the secret musical pieces are pretty repetitive since in their context they were just 10-second loops and entirely optional and don't impact the game in any big way.\n\nDifficulty -- Chapter's 1 and 2 are very easy as they're tutorials. But some of the puzzles and platforming in Chapter 3 are really frocking tough, and sometimes will take at least an hour to nail down. But being such a large world, you can usually always skip through the platforming and puzzles via a secret path or completing certain quests.\n\nReplayability -- I've never really heard of a replayable 2D Platformer before, except for maybe Mario Maker, but that's not really a game. But I've replayed Knytt Underground a few times now. A typical playthrough, focusing just on story takes roughly 5 hours. Filling up the map of each chapter, roughly 15 hours. 100 percenting that playthrough takes around 50 hours.\n\nModability and Community -- Since Knytt Underground is such an underrated and hidden gem in Steam, the community is small and inactive, likewise is the modding community. Infact, there's little to no mods, nothing major at least.\n\nTIME TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!\n--\n"The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art"\nThis is to avoid distracting the tight platforming.\n--\nNitpicks -- I always go against Nitpicking, but for a masterpiece which is claimed by many or myself, I will point out issues. There's very little impactful nitpicks in Knytt, thankfully, but there is some. When you transform into the ball, you can sometimes bounce at the very top of slanted edges, but this can be dismissed as being on purpose. Realistically, the same thing would happen.","January 25","true","46.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

Yet, I can safely say it's an amazing platformer and very well put together. I got until the last chapter by myself but after exploring most of the rooms I just couldn't bother to exploring every single one of them so I just went on Youtube and saw a walkthrough from where I was until the end and I loved it. While at first glance Knytt Underground may look like just another puzzle platformer amongst the many others that have came out on recent years, it's not. Knytt Underground tells a story, a very strange story that will only make sense by the end of the game. The story is told in a hidden way, just like an hidden message and there are places online where you can see peoples explanations of the story in case that's the only thing that interests you. Besides that, Knytt Underground is a very well made platformer, very fluid, responsive controls, possibly Super Meat Boy level of controls along with some minor teleport and flying mechanics. The soundtrack on this game is nothing short of amazing, very calm and charming along with the brilliant visuals that decorate the background and they vary alot from level to level. Overall, it's pretty safe to say that you can't go wrong with Knytt Underground, either if you're looking for a great platformer or for a great story, it is an incredibly well made game.","December 22, 2013","true","4.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

If so, buy this game. If not, buy this game anyways.\nKnytt Underground is, by and large, one of the best 2D platformers available on the PC.\n\nThe game has beautiful environments, an excellent soundtrack and level ambience that can put sites like asoftmurmur.com to shame. Simply put, it's therapeutic to the nth degree. The platforming is simply top notch with (no exaggeration) perfect, 1:1 controls and level design that can get pretty nintendo hard at times. The 'overworld' itself is freaking massive - and like any other Nifflas game, it's packed to the brim with secrets. You will miss secrets on your first playthrough, guaranteed.\n\nHowever, KU is not without its faults. One terribly massive con - no native controller support. It's very easy to work around this, (try ControllerToKeyboard for Windows, Enjoyable for OSX, or qJoyPad for Linux) but you'd think for a PC platformer it would come with partial support at the very least. There is also a surprising amount of dialogue for such a game, but you're really not missing much if you skip through all of it. If you're capable of reading a minimap, you can skip through all the dialogue you want.","July 20, 2015","true","5.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Playing the original Knytt felt like a sweet regular nintendo game with way better sound.\n\nKnytt Underground feels like if the franchise just came to Super Nintendo as it significantly sets the bar higher than the previous game. Everything is improved and worth paying for.\n\nYears ago, I played Knytt which was a free platformer game from some guy i never heard of. He or someone provided a level editor and pretty soon, I was playing dozens and dozens of fan mods (essentially the same game concept but with different locations, music, puzzles and enemies and some pretty infuriating gameplay mechanics)\n\nWhat drew me into Knytt and kept me coming back was the great feeling of size and scope. The sound design was always brilliant. Wonderful ambient music (which is some of my favorite kind of music) no voice acting (good thing) , satisfying sounds of scuttling along, jumping, crawling up walls, splashing into water, ect. You feel like a little beetle bug just trying to get somewhere.\n\nGenerally Knytt games revolved around a very bare bones narrative story, just simply enforcing the idea you had to get somewhere. Sometimes the motive was silly, sometimes it was supposed to be serious.\n\nDepending on which map you got, you might have a giant maze world full of keys you have to collect to advance, like a typical metroidvania, and/or was simply set up in a way that required abilities to be found and progress. Sometimes it was both.\n\nnever did the game hold your hand. It generally pointed you to go "left" and that's all the instructions you usually got. Figure it out on your own.\n\nKnytt Underground is all of this, still. But its better. the new gameplay mechanics immediately feel welcome and a great add on to an already winning formula !\n\nThe only criticism I have for Knytt Underground is the art style of the "sprites" (as in, the characters who identify as sprites, little magical beings). I don't mean the pixelated sprite that represents a game character in a 2D pixelated game. In action, the sprites look fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing.\nhowever, the points where the game pauses for dialog with a NPC are where I have issues.\n\nThe original Knytt, if I recall correctly, didn't do this. Character's 1 line or so of dialog would simply display as you walked near them and the dialog disappeared when you got a certain distance away.\n\nNow the dialog is initiated by pressing a button, which is fine ! No problem with this. The problem is the hideous enlarged profile portrait of a sprite when you are talking to it (or when your sprite character is talking).\nSuddenly all that beautiful art style you were enjoying gets shattered by the worst looking MS PAINT quality blotches of color I've ever seen in a game. (ok, i've probably seen worse but the point is these are completely out of place).\nI wish they either re-did these to look smaller (as the larger presentation is what reveals how crappy they look) or simply use their head instead of the whole body. Because they simply look awful. I do not like.\n\n\nOther than that, I pretty much covered it all ! Watch some gameplay vids of the original Knytt to see what i'm talking about.\nA great experience. I recommend.","September 2, 2014","true","1.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

These games, created by a lone developer called Nifflas (also of NightSky and Saira fame), are some of the finest exploration-based platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Knytt Underground is the most recent in the series, and while it might be the most ambitious, it makes some unexpected departures from the previous games.\n\nYou know you're in for something special when the game loads straight to a tutorial that turns out to be the main menu. There are three chapters in Knytt Underground, though the first two are essentially introductions to the massive third. You play both as Mi Sprocket, a mute little sprite, and Bob, a sentient bouncing ball from another early Nifflas game, Within a Deep Forest. Together they embark on a grand journey through the underground of a post-apocalyptic Earth far more mysterious and colorful than anything you've seen in Fallout. The surfaces you traverse are all shown in silhouette but the backgrounds are vibrant, animated collages of Photoshopped worlds. Every alien landscape you can imagine is represented here, with enormous gardens, crystal caves, blasted deserts, crumbling temples, ominous graveyards, and sinister machinery among them.\n\nWhile you have a massive, massive map to explore, don't confuse this with a metroidvania. Mi and Bob never gain new abilities to navigate with, though their own basic skills provide a wealth of options. Mi can climb walls and Bob can bounce, and switching freely between the two allow you to pull of some surprising maneuvers. There are also colored seeds that grant Mi a one-time power like flying in a straight line, and robots that Bob can tether to. Creative use of these resources can indeed get you anywhere you need to go, no matter how impossible the passage seems. The result is almost like a puzzle game, where you'll find rooms that look like they need special powers to traverse, but eventually you'll have that eureka moment and puzzle it out yourself.\n\nYou'll have tons of items to find as well, and the denizens of the underground give quests that'll reward you with what you need or point you in the right direction. These items are used to pass the gates barring your ultimate objective, but there's some welcome flexibility to the collecting. One gate might require 5 items out of a possible set of 8, and if you find some of the game's well-hidden coins you can substitute them as well. This means you'll never get stuck on a particular puzzle for a single item, and exploration will always reward you with something you can use.\n\nPrevious Knytt games had stark pixel graphics and a distinct sense of isolation to them. Nifflas often populates his strange and alien worlds with little harmless critters but not sentient creatures, usually leaving you alone to explore the vast spaces in solitude. Knytt Underground is a sharp departure here, adding not only loads of characters to talk and deal with, but also giving them incredibly unexpected personalities. Everyone speaks with modern sensibilities, almost like irreverent sitcom characters. They'll call out their own foibles and contrivances, and denigrate a lot of your quests as pointless busywork. One of your two pixie companions is also as foul-mouthed as you can imagine, frequently telling people to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves and eat glass and such. It's such a weird departure in tone from the previous games, even moreso in how their hideous, blobby portraits clash with the clean lines of the rest of the game.\n\nThe NPCs are the only major knock against an otherwise atmospheric experience, and to be fair, seeing their character arcs through redeems the worst offenders. Even on top of the 10+ hours of exploration the game offers, there are a host of secrets to find. Some are tied up in the game's unique and challenging fast travel system which I won't spoil, but be aware there's no easy teleporting around the enormous map until you master it. Just like the rest of the game, though, it's worth putting the time into to experience. Knytt Underground is a marvelous journey from start to finish, one that's easy to immerse in and immensely rewarding to play.","February 4","true","12.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I've spent most of my day today playing it because it's just that engaging.\nIt's a beautiful combination of exploration-based gameplay and 2D platforming. The game map is huuuuuge. And that could be a bad thing, but exploring it is a joy because of the diverse atmospheres and all the little bits of story scattered throughout. I filled out the map simply because it was fun to explore. There's hundreds of puzzles and plenty of hidden objects to find, and the map's nice enough to mark mostly everything for you. The only thing you have to find on your own are the hidden passages (which on a few occasions are really difficult to find and figuring out how to reach hidden rooms is quite the epiphany~)\nThat's not to say the game is easy, though. There's plenty of difficult action sequences, and if you plan to get all the achievements you really need to master the controls and the game's physics, because it can be HARD. Not quite as difficult as some precision platformers get, but you can spend a lot of time on the same screen or two.\nI really can't properly describe how this game pulls you in. Personally, I'd sit down, boot it up, and start filling in more of the map, only to discover that two or more hours had vanished while I was making progress. It's a game that demands your attention and doesn't easily let it go.

I'll try to make it simple.\n\nKnytt Underground is a platformer with puzzle mechanic. Most of the time these puzzles are simple.  switch between 2 forms (human for climbing, and ball for bouncing) and  use "right one-use-power" at the right time to get to hard to reach places.\n\nThe thing is some solutions are not so simple and not very obvious on first sight so you might end up trying to go around some areas ... often leaving you in this "what the fudge" state. That made me use a uncovered map i found on google :P.  And made me revisit most of the areas and try to "re-reach" areas if there was some hidden passage. And belive me there are lots of them. But there are also areas only accessible if you uncover lore about characters. Just do every quest you find(or events marked as "?"), so dont get frustrated if you cant reach something now.\n\nFirst two chapters are more of a tutorial short and simple. Real challange is chapter 3 wich is HUGE, map covers WHOLE SCREEN. played almost 20 hours of it to reach to the end (i started to use uncovered map after having about half of the map reveald and it had lots of uncovered holes).\n\nThere is this teleporting mechanic wich lets you teleport across the map but i havent use it ... cause i didnt know how so i ignored it.\n\nIn overal the game is challenging. ESPECIALLY if you plan to unlock all steam achevements. so if you are aiming for that i suggest reading steam community walkthroughs cause there is one achevement you get for "not paying bell guards for entrence" wich i did unfortunately.\n\nOther reviews state that dialogues are bad ... well maybe because this world is confusing, maybe that was the aim for the creators to make strange relations between races while engaging in some dificult topics about main characters. Depends on personal tastes . I didnt find them that bad. Some funny more or less. (there is even one adult joke but i wont spoil it :P)\n\nBackground pictures are amazing. Music is calm and pleasing. For adventurer LOTS of secrets to uncover.\n\nIn overall its a average game, good choice if you have nothing to play, Would be nice addicion for a mobile game.(there would be problem with implementing chapter 3 world map).\n\nI "kind of" liked it.\n\nEDIT: This game seems complex but there is no wiki focused on this game unfortunately, wich would be usefull since there are lots of secrets, world lore, and interactions with NPCs in it.","April 13, 2015","true","19.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A solid design that invites you to explore the well told story. A nice sequel.\n\nReview\nDesign:\nThe graphics in this game are extremely cleverly made. The highlighting of important things are a good guide through the game, while the real setting is rather introvert but very beautiful. The athmosphere of the game is keeping up the whole time from the very first until the last second of the game. Even though it kind of remings me of Braid, it is still it's own in a kinda way. 8/10\n\nMusic & Audio:\nWhile the audio is deeply integrated to the game, the music is kind of lost. Long phases without music playing in the background are taking the fun of the game, but when the music plays, it is very breathtaking and keeps up the morale. 8/10\n\nGameplay & Addiction:\nBesides that forced humor that is kind of annoying, the story of this game is told very great and is worth as much as the original Knytt. The gameplay is familiar and very clear, even though the level designs feel like labyrinths sometimes, but that's good. The long and sometime difficult levels are very fine and provide a lot of gamefun and playing hours. 7/10\n\nCost-Benefit Equation & resumé:\nThis is truely a great sequel to the platformer that will take your breath. A kind of funny told story that is worth it's money. The gaming duration is worth it, if you like to play interactive stories. Who cares about books? Play Knytt. 7/10\n\nFor the cheap price of 6.99€ (1.99€ in sale at the moment!) you get more than you can ask. Sell some of your useless DotA2/TF2/CS:GO stuff and buy this game.\n\nThank you!

The big game mechanic here is that your character can switch between being a girl and being a ball at will. Yep, it sounds ridiculous, nobody in the story seems to care that this happens, but it's a fun mechanic. The girl can climb up walls, and the ball can jump high and gain some serious horizontal uncontrollable speed, which is fun, until you hit a ledge or something. You can climb to a high distance with the girl, then change to the ball and gain some extra jump height, or you can jump high with the ball and get to a climbing spot the girl couldn't get to before. Cool little mechanic with momentum.\n\nExploration is the main part of the game. There's little mini stories scattered all over for you to find. It's a big map, so there's quite a few of them. Fortunately, if they ask you to get something, it's usually nearby, so you don't have to take 30 minutes traveling across a 2d maze to get a McGuffin, just a few minutes at most. The world is a maze; nothing is straight forward. So have fun traveling as a ball one direction and ending up somewhere on the map you didn't expect.","June 23, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One thing I would recommend is playing in windowed mode as the graphics appear stretched in fullscreen.\n\nKnytt Underground is one of my favourite games that I have played this year, totally unexpectedly. I came into this thinking I'd mess around on it for half an hour but what I found is one of the most deep and immensely enjoyable puzzle exploration 'complete the map' games I have ever played. I can't really explain it, but I found the mechanics really fun and easy to get the hang of yet difficult to master and the game has an unexplainable charm to it that I haven't found in many other games this year. Initially in the first two chapters the game seems small and limited, but this is simply a tutorial or prologue if you will to the massive chapter 3 which is when the whole game's map opens up. It's addictive to try and discover and explore each of the grids in the game's map system and to discover the secret and story behind each area. Many areas involve puzzles which make use of enemies and hazards and the game's climbing and jumping mechanics to solve, and the ability to *SPOILER* transform into a ball and use momentum to bounce and reach previously unreachable areas *SPOILER* which is fun in itself.\n\nIt's one of the games that looks simple and low-budget and to an extent it is, but it also has this deceptively deep story and an incredible atmosphere and soundtrack which to me at least is one of the hardest but most important elements of a game to get right.\n\nTo say go play this game and see for yourself isn't very helpful I know, but it really is something that you need to play to understand the points I'm making. If you're feeling hesitant, buy it on sale, but keep it on your wishlist because this is a game that you need to play.","December 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The movement in this game feels great - once you hear your little feet scamper up a wall as you climb it you'll fall in love.\n\nThis series of games proves that indie games don't have to hide behind quirky graphics and a "message" (*cough* LIMBO *cough*) to be worth playing.

As it stands, the game does better with controller enabled, but since it's lacking support.. you can use workaround like Joy2Key to have controller support.\n\nFor the game itself, It's an exploration platformer, meaning you won't find many enemies to pawn like in Giana Sister or Mark of the Ninja. What you need is to move around, get past puzzle and do some tricks to advance. There are some annoying puzzles though that require you to be precise with the jump timing, or backtracking quite a bit when you fail. I guess it's part of the game.\n\nThe OST is a complete opposite of Electronic Super Joy with its hard punk - or whatever it's called - OST genre. The OST is pretty bland and unnoticed at times, well I don't think about it too much, the game's pretty slow paced as well.\n\nAll in all, a quite unique game.

Perhaps one of the best, period. The world of Knytt is so brilliantly atmospheric and immersive.\nI found myself more drawn into the world, the story and the characters in this game than in any other game I've ever played.\nThe platforming and puzzle elements are generally quite fun and  challenging. Challenging, but never to the point that I lost my ♥♥♥♥. This is partly due to the fact that I spent much of my time simply exploring it's brilliant world and talking to the interesting, amusing, and complex characters.\nThe art style is absolutely brilliant, and mostly consists of black sillhouette foregrounds, cartooney characters and backgrouns made of photos of various things like rocks and flowers, and such, pieced together in interesting ways.\nThe music is often times quite trippy and kind of melancholy, which really adds to the lonely atmosphere of the game. It's surprising that a game about sprites and fairies in a post-apocalyptic world, could have some of the most realistic, and  deep characters of any game I've ever played.\nBottom line, this is a game that has so much fun platforming, puzzle solving, exploration, atmosphere, and heart that...just buy it already!

(If you haven't played them, go and do so. They're free, and give a good grasp of the feel of Nifflas' games)\n\nWhat really differentiates Knytt Underground from Nifflas' prior work is the story. I've seen all too many reviews disregard the story, saying it's weak. An awful lot of reviewers have evidently missed what the story is. The central plot is not the story. It's little more than a framing work, something to give you a reason to go and explore the hauntingly beautiful landscape.\n\nThe real story is on the side-lines. It's about religion, and whether it matters if there's a god, and WHY it matters to people whether or not there is. It's about the good, the bad and the ugly of faith and belief and all the little insecurities of life. It's supported in this by a very human cast. (Which is vaguely amusing given the lack of humans present.) I actually cared about Dora, and Cilia, and even the little side characters who did little but add flavour to the world, building it up to something that feels real.\n\nMy love of this game can only be aptly compared to my love of the works of Tove Jansson, whose Moomin series holds a strong resemblance to the work.\n\nLet this vaguely aimed and rambling essay tell you: This game is worth it.","March 15, 2014","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The enjoyment of this game for me comes in with the characters, the atmosphere, and the setting.  While there is no combat or complex puzzles and a lot of quests dead end and have no rewards, what you are left with is a game you play for the story.  If the story isn't to your liking here then you probably wont like the game, but it worked out pretty well for me.  I liked the interaction and development between the characters, and the game doesn't feel held back when it comes to discussing a few unpleasant topics or having characters act vulgar or make violent expressions when it fits (hence the game's Mature ESRB rating).  The game's art-style for character portraits was initially a turn-off for me but I found myself not really minding it later into the game.  The game also has good sound and art design for its environments, and can be very nicely ambient in atmosphere.  The setting and lore of the game was very appealing to me too, and gives the player a few humorous moments thanks to meta-knowledge that the characters in the story dont posess.\n\nPerformance - No issues, runs fine, rebindable controls, graphics options are satisfactory.  Controls are fairly tight and platforming is not very problematic.  Some puzzles are hard, but not excessively so, and the game is very much non-punishing for failure-retry in its puzzles.  There are optional parts with quite difficult puzzles, but those are presented completely aside from the main setting of the game.\n\nIts a very good game, and quite long too for an indie game.  I spent a lot of time enjoying myself and exploring things, and seeking out a few optional achievements, and put in about 20 hours into the game.  I know this sort of enjoyment that is more story than gameplay driven is not for everyone, so a lot of people might find the game boring or lose interest, but I would definately reccommend it.\n","May 19, 2014","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The two most notable of these titles are Within a Deep Forest and Knytt. Within a Deep Forest had players taking control of a sentient bouncing ball that had to save the world from a bomb. The game focused on the bouncing physics of different types of balls of different weights and materials.\n\nKnytt focused on a little hero of the same name needing to find parts to fix a crashed spaceship so that he could get back home. The mechanics here dealt with the notion of climbing and sticking to walls. Both of these games have now been combined to create Knytt Underground which marks Nifflas’ first move into the realm of console gaming.\n\nSplit into three chapters, Knytt Underground has players take on the role of the mute Mi Sprocket as she explores a huge environment. Her aim is to look for human artefacts and complete quests in a Metroidvania style. The first two chapters act as short tutorials to help players understand the mechanics of how Mi and then Bob the ball handle. By chapter three the two characters have magically been morphed together allowing players to change from Mi to Bob at will.\n\nThis allows for some situations requiring lightning reflexes as you change from Mi to the bouncing ball mid-air to cannon off the landscape at all sorts of weird and wonderful angles in order to reach new areas. As well as the bouncing and climbing there are different coloured plumes of smoke which give temporary abilities. These range from turning Mi invisible, making her jump higher or turning her into a set that can shoot horizontally or vertically.\n\nEverything is designed as a means for you to get to another locations and this is where Knytt Underground really works well. Nifflas games before this have always focused on short bursts of quick reflexes and skill. When Knytt Underground asks players to do the same it comes to life in a flurry of ever changing physics and colourful plumes of smoke. (Note to developer – a colour-blind filter would really help with those plumes of smoke)\n\nHowever, in Knytt Underground there are often long stretches of exploration through empty screens to reach these areas. Sometimes the beautiful graphics and sound create a haunting and ambient environment which you don’t mind trekking through. At other times it can all be a little dull as you wander through empty screen after empty screen. This was an issue on the PS3 version but strangely, seems to be much less of an issue on the PC. Maybe we’ve mellowed a bit, or maybe it just fits the system a bit better.\n\nWhen Knytt Underground works it works well but when it doesn’t it can feel a bit  empty. This isn’t helped by the seeming lack of progress you make. There are numerous quests and items to discover but on completing or collecting them it doesn’t seem to mean much. Of course it all adds up in the end but the game could do with tweaking its risk reward system to help players feel a greater sense of achievement after they have overcome some of the incredibly fiendish screens.\n\nIt is worth highlighting just how lovely the game looks and sounds. This game is beautiful and the music is of the highest standard. We expect no less from a Nifflas game and in that department Knytt Underground can never be faulted with a stunningly ambient atmosphere created throughout. The spaced out save points also seem less of an issue in the PC version, even though some of them are still some distance away from tricky sections of the game and back tracking is something that can begin to hinder the experience. We lost count of the amount of times we trekked along a tunnel for five or six screens only to reach a character telling us we needed to bring a certain item to them. This then meant trekking back through all the screens again. There really isn’t a need for this and you wonder if the game would have benefitted from a slightly smaller, more focused, map without many of the empty screens - or at least the ability to teleport between save points.\n\nOverall, Knytt Underground is another promising game for Nifflas. The look and sound of the game is gorgeous and easily rivals the best 2D artwork out there. The game itself gives players a huge world to explore but many may well feel that it lacks focus and a real sense of rewards for the skill you need in order to progress. Those looking for an adventure set at a slower pace will love it, while others will be left wanting a bit more excitement.\n\n7/10","February 4, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, this is not just "more of the same", and does see him treading new ground.\n\nGameplay is exploration heavy and very atmospheric. Many areas have puzzles or hazards like enemies and lava, and in some cases (mostly in secret levels) those can be quite difficult. However, those are not the focus of the game, and many other areas there's only platforming or even no obstacles at all. You don't gain permanent powerups, but areas may have objects that give you temporary abilities. Emphasis is on the scenary and atmosphere instead, and on the story.\n\nYes, the story.

You spend most of the game with two companions with layered personalities and backstories, and can choose which one of them will talk for you with most NPCs. As you explore you'll uncover more of their backstory along with the mute protagonist's. The story defies a lot of genre conventions; quests don't always end in a way the characters find satisfying (though they usually do), people are occasionally unable or unwilling to compensate you, and ultimately a lot of doubt is cast on the claim that your quest to "save the world" is actually doing anything. Combined with the unusual backstories and themes, it is a pretty unique experience.\n\nThe game becomes extremely nonlinear once you beat the introductory chapters. You can explore in any direction as far as you want, and the world is huge, but if you want you can "beat" the game before seeing huge portions of it. There's also tons of secret rooms and levels, both within the game world and accessible from exploring the menu/hub world.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend trying this game. Just don't expect any aspect of it to be fast paced.","April 9","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now available on Steam, the game has you playing the role of a little girl who looks like some kind of evil doll. Look at her run, that’s evil. Freaky little legs swinging around like sticks. But either way this little girl goes on a metroid style quest to explore temples and dungeons. While the game may look like a first grader’s attempt at drawing, the level design is pretty solid. The dialog is a bit strange, and for some reason the game got an M rating because somehow characters get into sexual conversations and curse a lot. There’s something a little… special? about this game. If you can get past that, you will find some fun platforming and metroidvania style platforming. Plus now I’m going to beat it just to find out what that M rating was for.\n\nWatch the full review on ShotGaming.com Steam Shots EP124","November 25, 2013","true","1.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

However, the result is not something which I can call worthwhile.\n\nGraphics:\nUnfortunately, the transition to higher res graphics is not flattering at all. While Stories used simple sprites, the low res meant that this could pass for a purposeful aesthetic and it worked. Underground, by contrast, looks generally incoherent. The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art - they are impossible to take seriously.\n\nAudio:\nThe music and sound effects are consistently fitting, minimal and and atmospheric so a good job on this count.\n\nGameplay:\nThe platforming mechanics here are fairly good, the level layouts are smart and there are a good number of save points along the way. The chaper two mechanics are pretty neat. However, progression through the game is not rewarding in the same way that a good Metroidvania should be. A lack of character upgrades and variety makes progression feel less like purposeful exploration and more like aimless stumbling around and backtracking. On a technical note, there is no controller support. The creator suggests using joy2key or xpadder but having tried this, it is clear that design choices in the keyboard conrtrols make this impractical.\n\nDialog:\nThis is one of the more frustrating parts of the whole experience. It is clear that there was an attempt to be whimsical here but in reality, the dialog just serves to pull you right out of the game; creating a feeling that neither the characters or the writer are invested at all. Rather than being charming, it just kills the neat atmospheric mood that the game partway manages to establish.\n\nOverall:\nUnfortunately, I can't recommend this game. Play Knytt Stories instead. It is free and feels much more complete and satisfying than Underground in every way. If you like Stories, then maybe consider buying this to support Nifflas almost as a donation for that game.","August 25, 2014","false","2.5"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","1"

I would also note the great fairy companion Cilia, her intelligence and cynicism really brought a few smiles for me.\n\nIf you like slower platforming games and exploration, pick it up, it can come with some pretty big discounts during sales, there should be a demo somewhere on the internet, not much of a free roam but shows some of the gameplay to test.\n\nEdit: Actually I think it's one of my favourite games ever, while Knytt Stories are endless, Underground is huge and complete, and I'm happy to have 100% completed it. If Nifflas decides to make the same type of game, but expand it to the point where I could zoom and scroll through the map, and it would stretch so far that it would require me to plan entire travels, because of how "open-world-rpgy" long they would take- then that's the game that I could take on a deserted island.

It's Too Much of A Good Thing.Genre: Indie 2D Platformer Exploration Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Nifflas' Games & Ripstone\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, PS3 and Vita.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Game & Story Thoughts\nKnytt Underground is a 2D platformer/exploration/physics puzzler developed by Nifflas’ Group. It’s the third game in the series though you won’t likely have heard of the previous two games as they never made it to Steam. You follow the adventures of Mi, a mute sprite who must ring six special bells in this underground world in order to save it. She is joined by a sentient, yet also mute, bouncing ball and two fairies. So, with this quirky cast of characters, you are tasked to save the world….and fetch every single item in this vast world of sprites.\n\nYou begin with a couple of short tutorial chapters to get you familiar with the game mechanics that Knytt has. After that, the game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you in chapter three. The game world is huge and there is a lot to see. Much of the game is focused around exploring every nook and cranny while listening to a pretty darn good soundtrack. There's also a story involving your two companion fairies that gets fleshed out during your adventures though I found the writing to be wonky. Basically, there's a science VS religion theme going throughout the story and I'm not convinced that it pulls it off that well. The two fairies themselves are also a bit two dimensional and predictable to how they'll treat each situation. It's not well written.\n\nLevel Design\nWhile the game has over 1,800 rooms to explore, a lot of them are empty corridors and dead-ends. A very large majority of the quests in this game are fetch quests and the rest are finding somebody. (So, just ½ of the fetch quest). Most items are obtained after solving physics-based puzzles that get continually harder as the game progresses. Getting around the world is a chore as the fast-travel system is very gimmicky and tricky to get to the area that you really want to be. The whole shadow world that has you rushing in a netherworld to get to the exit but if you don't get there in time, you'll be thrown into a random room that doesn't help you progress forward. It can get extremely tiresome to deal with.\n\nThe Game's Content\nI will say that I enjoyed the exploration...for a while. I enjoyed the puzzles...for a while. I enjoyed the fetch quests...for a while. It’s really a testament to the game that I tolerated 14 hours of fetch quests. But towards the end of the game, I just wanted it to end. The game’s content is bloated, repetitive and lacking in interesting new mechanics to explore after a while. While being able to transform into a ball is a little different on the platforming genre, I think its the worst part of the game as some areas and puzzles require extremely precise jumping in order to pass.\n\nRagequit\nThe game ended for me when I got to the 5th major locked door in the game. Each bell that has to be rung is locked by a jerkface sprite that demands you hand over items for varying reasons ranging from “I’m just like this because reasons” to “You need to PROVE yourself”. (This goes back to my complaint that the story isn't well written). When I was told, at the 5th door, that I still needed more items in order to pass, (and hence complete the game) I pretty much said this: NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE. I’M DONE, I’M FINISHED. I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. And promptly quit the game. I do understand that there are ways to get around the bell without paying but it requires trial and error to get around him through the other world system. I can only tolerate so much of the same repetitive activity. The enemy variety is lacking and many of the >physics< puzzles consist of a lot of trial and error. An absurd amount of trial and error dependent on nailing skillshots at the right time in the midst of bouncing around the room. It can get very quickly frustrating after dealing with it for 10+ hours. There's nothing there to really vary it up.\n\nPC Settings\nKnytt has rebindable keys and audio sliders. Graphics settings are extremely basic, allowing for changing full screen and some enabling/disabling minor effects. That's all. It's a stunningly basic settings menu. While 2D games don't necessarily need a lot of settings, not even having the basic such as V-Sync or Resolution is not ok. One last note: the character running around in the chapter-select screen is cute but please don’t add it to future games. Adding time to entering the game (especially when its the longest path of all the three chapters) gets very old. Using a regular menu UI is much more preferable to getting us into the actual game. No need to make a repetitive game out of entering the actual game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI can’t recommend Knytt Underground. The game is unique with a great soundtrack and solid enough presentation for sure but the repetitive gameplay and frustrating trial-and-error puzzles drove me insane. It’s a large ocean of a world with the depth of a puddle. Adding different kinds of quests and less item questing would have made the experience more enjoyable in my mind. The game is far too long considering its story and mechanical depth. You'll realistically see most of the game's mechanics in the first two tutorial levels before moving onto the main world. Said world will only slightly change things up, but depend far too much on what it first designed to create challenges. The story itself takes too long (mostly due to the game's pacing issues) and has a central, if uninteresting, conflict between religion and science that has been done better elsewhere. This is, bemusingly, too much content for this game's concept and execution.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","August 6, 2014","false","14.7"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","7"

I wanted to like it, but frankly it's just as disappointing as I found Nightsky.\n\nThere are two main problems. First, the -mood- of the game is terrible. Yes, it's called "Underground", but the art style and background style is far far too gloomy. The aesthetics are just a huge turn-off. The background images tend to be real images or 3d rendered images that seem completely out of place. The terrain is simply all black. The color palette for the entire game is a poorly chosen collection of neons and gray hues, clashing with the cartoonish style. It's just all terrible.\n\nSecond, the gameplay isn't any good. The dev has had 5 games to polish it up, but the new mechanics introduced like switches and really inaccurate swinging are more annoying than fun.

While retaining similar mechanics to previous games (running, jumping, exploration and fetch quests), the games adds in a lot more characters and dialogue making it a somewhat "chatty" experience. But the dialogue is tacky. It feels like something I would think was cool in middle school, and if I was trying to write something in a second language. The scenery consists of photoshopped fruits and hardware that feels tacked on, like early 90's CG in action movies. The story is juvenile and plodding. The game forces is episodic, and each episode ends up with you retracing places you've been before, but rather than being part of the exploration or platforming it's just something that makes you run back and forth.\n\nThese games are all about the atmosphere and solid mechanics as you explore an otherwise featureless world for vaguely defined reasons. The formula didn't work so well in this incarnation. To sum up: cringe-worthy characters and dialogue, passionless art, less-interesting level design than previous fare. Only for hardcore Nifflas fans, or if you're really bored, I guess.","August 1, 2014","false","3.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

The control-switching feature makes for interesting challenges and feels well-suited to smooth, efficient movement when exploring (although you might prefer to slow down and admire the backgrounds). Furthermore, the game is overflowing with secrets, to the point of having secrets nested within secrets.\n\nThe game stars a mute sprite named "Mi" and later a pair of fairies that speak for her - your interactions with other NPCs serve to characterize the trio. The game is sometimes silly, but it also sometimes touches on weighty issues. The world's inhabitants, despite being mythical creatures, are relatable and act very human.\n\nAn excellent game, well worth your time.","January 31, 2015","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Underground's predecessors might even be older than some of the folks reading this review.  Fortunately, they are all available on the developer's website, free of charge.  Since 2006, I've played them many times; seriously, they're some of the most charming games out there.  If you're on the fence about this title, look up Nifflas and give Knytt Stories a test drive - you won't regret it.\n\nKnytt Underground is a game of simple two-dimensional platforming and exploration, broken up into three chapters.  The first two chapters are short mini-stories introducing your characters - one, a humanoid who can scramble up walls, and the other, a strange ball with elastic properties.  The third chapter is the main draw, and has the two main characters join forces to accomplish a great quest.  The quest itself is basically a series of mini-fetch-quests, but that hardly matters.  The fun comes from exploring the enormous, intricate map.  Level design seems relatively minimalist, but the gradual change from region to region, and the charming, easter-egg like decorations on every screen are the real reward.  Expect a lot of soft, ambient lights, soothing sounds and music, and a satisfying, effortless grace to your navigation.  There's no frustration here, and navigation is pure joy.\n\nIf you're coming for hardcore gaming, I'd stay away; this is not that game.  Also, don't expect much in terms of story; Underground has inexplicably included a couple of fairies to join you on your grand adventure; neither of them are very interesting, none of the dialogue is well-written, and one of them has a penchant for dropping F-bombs, detracting from the family-frendliness of the game.  It's kept to a minimum, though, so it's not enough to detract from such a joyful exploration experience.  Give the original Knytt games a go, and if you love them as much as I do, go ahead and get this, too.  Support this developer.  This is every bit as good as I was hoping, and I would love to keep revisiting this series for a long time to come.","January 20, 2015","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let the first two chapters fool you, those are just to ease you into it. After that you'll experience a great deal of freedom while traversing the map.\n+ Beautiful atmospherical graphics. Just look at those screenshots.\n+ Nice music as well. No wait, the music is awesome, and so is the sound design.\n+ Very simple but fun, tight mechanics.\n\n~ Don't expect any kind of deep emotional storyline. It's cute and funny at times and there is some (actually quite some) intruiging lore to try to make sense of, but the way it's conveyed didn't work quite enough for me, personally. I would have loved a bit more of immersive style of writing, the wit of the dialogues pull me out of it too much. Or rather they fail to draw me in.\n\n- Unfortunately the fixed resolution is kinda low, especially on a 27" monitor. I have played this before on the PS Vita (one of my favorite games on that platform) and there it looks pretty clean and sharp. Not as much now, although it's still pretty enough to get fully immersed in. So arguably the PC is not the best way to play this game, maybe. Maybe.\n\n\nHaving said that I would nevertheless heartily recommend this game for anyone fond of 2D platforming world exploration kind of games. It's very satisfting discovering new areas while jumping around like the most agile spelunker in history.

It is the sort of thing that you can play for ten or fifteen minutes and feel like you accomplished something, or intend to play for an hour and find yourself still playing after four.\n\nThe ball mechanics are as close to perfect as you can find in a game.  Importantly, there is some ability for course correction mid-air, so you are not bound to just ricocheting around based only on your bounce.  And the transformation mechanic lets you move in ways that neither the sprite nor the ball could alone.\n\nThe core of the game is exploration.  Puzzles are usually “how do I get there from here?” and typically aren’t more than four or six rooms.  They are spread about often enough to be interesting, yet sparse enough that at no time does it feel like you just completed a difficult challenge only to be rewarded with a harder one, and in fact almost always do reward you.  The rewards vary from inventory items (which may be quest related) to story exposition, and sometimes earthquakes that open up new paths elsewhere.\n\nDeath is mostly non-punishing, typically at most it resets you to the last safe position you were in, which is usually in the room you are currently in.  If you collected an item just before dying, it does not reset the item.  That said, you do have to then make it to a save point to keep the progress after leaving the game.\n\nMi, the character, is mute.  When you have a conversation with an NPC, you can choose if you want your friends Dora or Cilla to answer for you.  Dora is generally going to give an optimistic or positive answer, while Cilla tends to be cynical if not mean.  But they can and will also surprise you.\n\nWhile I very much enjoyed this game, the experience was certainly heightened by having played the developer’s previous games, which are not currently available on Steam.  I think it stands alone well, however there are many references to several other games (including ones for both Knytts and the Ball) that were very cool for those in the know.\n\nAs much as a third of the game’s rooms are hidden off-map.  Some are short or long challenges or even just “easter eggs” accessible from secret paths accessible from the chapter select area - hidden in secret tunnels.\n\nAlso please note the rating!  Cila in particular can be quite vulgar, and both of the fairies have histories that might be surprising and a bit colorful.\n\nI do recomend this game!\n","February 12, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Underground's predecessors might even be older than some of the folks reading this review.  Fortunately, they are all available on the developer's website, free of charge.  Since 2006, I've played them many times; seriously, they're some of the most charming games out there.  If you're on the fence about this title, look up Nifflas and give Knytt Stories a test drive - you won't regret it.\n\nKnytt Underground is a game of simple two-dimensional platforming and exploration, broken up into three chapters.  The first two chapters are short mini-stories introducing your characters - one, a humanoid who can scramble up walls, and the other, a strange ball with elastic properties.  The third chapter is the main draw, and has the two main characters join forces to accomplish a great quest.  The quest itself is basically a series of mini-fetch-quests, but that hardly matters.  The fun comes from exploring the enormous, intricate map.  Level design seems relatively minimalist, but the gradual change from region to region, and the charming, easter-egg like decorations on every screen are the real reward.  Expect a lot of soft, ambient lights, soothing sounds and music, and a satisfying, effortless grace to your navigation.  There's no frustration here, and navigation is pure joy.\n\nIf you're coming for hardcore gaming, I'd stay away; this is not that game.  Also, don't expect much in terms of story; Underground has inexplicably included a couple of fairies to join you on your grand adventure; neither of them are very interesting, none of the dialogue is well-written, and one of them has a penchant for dropping F-bombs, detracting from the family-frendliness of the game.  It's kept to a minimum, though, so it's not enough to detract from such a joyful exploration experience.  Give the original Knytt games a go, and if you love them as much as I do, go ahead and get this, too.  Support this developer.  This is every bit as good as I was hoping, and I would love to keep revisiting this series for a long time to come.","January 20, 2015","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The control-switching feature makes for interesting challenges and feels well-suited to smooth, efficient movement when exploring (although you might prefer to slow down and admire the backgrounds). Furthermore, the game is overflowing with secrets, to the point of having secrets nested within secrets.\n\nThe game stars a mute sprite named "Mi" and later a pair of fairies that speak for her - your interactions with other NPCs serve to characterize the trio. The game is sometimes silly, but it also sometimes touches on weighty issues. The world's inhabitants, despite being mythical creatures, are relatable and act very human.\n\nAn excellent game, well worth your time.","January 31, 2015","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely worth the money.\n\nThe game is first of all visually impressive - just as expected. Sometimes I wonder a bit if the experience wouldn't have been even better if the ground wasn't all black, throughout the whole world. One gets used to it, but the other knytt games had colored background, which looked a bit more friendly. However, it may be that black is a good choice to clearly differentiate between the background scenery and the ground you're walking on.\n\nStorywise, well, forget the story. It is really not necessary. Surprisingly, this game is much more about characters than about story - something I didn't expect. There are *lots* of NPCs to talk to, and almost every one of them has an own story and personality. What impressed me most is that once you reach the third chapter, you don't have any red line to follow, so you get the dialogues between the two main (talking) characters in some random order depending on which places you visit in which order. But although there are some main themes repeatedly exploited in the dialogue, it never gets messed up if you change the order. As for the dialogue itself, it's really excellently crafted and highly intelligent.\n\nWhile you're exploring the - really vast - world, you'll also explore the protagonists and the history of this world. Most games are about story advancement (and sometimes character advancement), but this one is purely about exploration. There's so much to discover you'll hardly remember an area you already visited. The game also features quite some subtle humor if you pay attention.\n\nAnd did I mention the soundtrack yet? It's awesome.\n\nNow, nothing is perfect. I'll flag the following comments as spoiler although it really is just a very mild one.\n\nOne thing I don't like about this game is that it's breaking the forth wall. Having the protagonists talk to the author talking steals away some of the atmosphere. But this only happens rarely, so it's forgivable. Another thing is that one does not get to know the main protagonist much. We do get to know something about her family, but almost nothing about herself. I know that this is a usual technique to make the player identify himself with the protagonist, but in this world where everyone else has a story, it's really strange that the protagonist lacks one. We don't even know whether she actually cannot speak or just doesn't want to.\n\nOh, and the super secret challenges section is really, really, really nasty.\n\n<rant>Just one last side note: I really cannot understand why this game got an M rating by the ESRB. Is critical thinking forbidden for teens in the USA? Yeah, it may be offensive if you're some fundamentalist, but seriously, why should such people dictate which games are appropriate for teens? Here in Germany, it's approved for age 12 and up.</rant>","December 19, 2013","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/248190/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","I want to start the review of Knytt Underground with one statement up front: I do not believe it to be a bad game, exactly. It does what it sets out to do, and does it well. The problem is that Knytt Undeground intends from a game design standpoint is not what I enjoy from games of its genre. I knew from the outset that the game is somewhat unconventional, but hoped I would enjoy it regardless. I did, for a time.\n\nWhat the game does right:\nDespite taking place underground, the game has a wide variety of backgrounds to its locations that can be quite beautiful.\nThe game prepares you relatively well for its platforming mechanics, which effectively make a great deal of its rooms into puzzles.\nThe feeling of finally making the tricky series of jumps required for some of the exploration/puzzles is satisfying.\nThe setting, if not the plot, is intriguing.\nWhy I lost interest regardless:\nThe first two chapters of the game are brief and relatively linear, and basically tutorials for the extremely non-linear chapter 3. The lack of any sense of focus in chapter 3 felt more to its detriment than benefit.\nAfter the beginning of chapter 3, the player receives no new abilities that change the gameplay in any significant way. Powerups are instead temporary, scattered through the map for the specific purpose of navigating one or a few rooms.\nBecause of the temporary nature of powerups and unchanging nature of the player's capabilities, the game lost all sense of progression. I could explore the third chapter's map to its loosely defined goals, but never felt rewarded for doing so outside satisfying my own curiosity. I did just that for a few hours, before the lack of perceived advancement made Knytt Underground more boring than entertaining.\nSo, do I recommend Knytt Undeground? Yes and no.\nDo you feel that exploration is its own reward? Then by all means, play it.\nIs curiosity alone enough for you to play a game for hours on end? If so, you'll probably have a good time.\nDo you need greater motivation in gameplay terms than either of those things, as I did? Then, unfortunately, Knytt Underground probably won't be very satisfying.\n\nI genuinely wanted to like the game, and I hope others do, but it was not for me.","April 1","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With past experience playing both Knytt and NightSky, you could be forgiven for saying that KU is something of a midway point between the two, with the sprite design of the former and background and atmosphere of the latter.\n\nThe controls take a bit of getting used to, but are eventually smooth and fluid and make for a lot of moments that make the player feel like a badass. There is a bit of flab in the plot, and I eventually defaulted to skipping the majority of the dialogue, but there's something innately satisfying about exploring, pulling off jumping puzzles, and finding all the little nooks and crannies in the map that would otherwise go unexplored. The tone isn't too light-hearted but also(thankfully) doesn't feel the need to take itself seriously, and the background design has this amazing, almost Pikmin-esque quality to it that looks incredible.\n\n\nEDIT: I wrote this review right as I was beginning to explore the full map that's revealed to the player a fair bit into the game. I will say that the map is kind of ridiculously huge, and the fetchquests get way, way too numerous to care about or keep track of. Also, something I failed to mention in the beginning is that the sprites look pretty odd, and it doesn't seem to be a stylistic choice. In-game character sprites all have this very weird look to them that makes it hard to take any serious moments seriously.\n\nHOWEVER. Everything I already said still stays true.

The stories were so spread out and so jumbled over the many hours of play, it was difficult to necessarily remember characters from time to time as they came up.  Even with the three protagonists, this was a problem, as I couldn't always recall what details were true of which one.\n\nThe second thing that didn't work out was the warp zones.  The entries to them were so spread out, and the exits not marked on the map at all.  So it always seemed better not to use them and walk straight to where I was going, rather than possibly walk the same distance and break a crystal.\n\nWhat is great is the feeling that you are exploring a real space.  This isn't an over map and castles, everywhere is connected to everywhere else, there are no barriers.\n\nThere are also some quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces, with music that wonderfully accompanies them.\n\nAnd as in Knytt, the pitter patter of the running and jumping is very satisfying.\n\nFinally, I have not idea why this game is M-rated.  Because one of the characters is a lesbian?  I find making a game M-rated simply because lesbians exist extremely offensive.","January 18","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However its story and characters have their unexpected quirks which may put you off, while late-game can get tedious with lengthy backtracking.\n\nThis game has left me with very mixed feelings, but my overall enjoyment still outweighs the frustrations and disappointments. For the measely $5 there's plenty of quality content even if you ignore the main story.\n\n\nPROS: Fantastic platforming.\nIf there's something Nifflas is good at - it's creating fun, responsive and challenging platforming with great stage design and interesting mechanics to go with it.\n\nHuge world.\n1440 unique rooms in the main story alone, not even including indoor areas or any of the extra content. That's impressive. Admittedly, many of them offer nothing beyond a pretty scenery, but plenty of others provide fun challenges and secrets to spice up your quest.\n\nAtmosphere.\nGame's massive world is filled with distinct areas and landmarks, surrounded in pretty glowing colors and over 100 tracks of fitting music. All this combines into an overall serene, beautiful and mysterious feeling. Just getting from point A to point B can be a very zen experience.\n\nExtra content.\nMain story is actually only about two-thirds of the content. Another big chunk is stashed inside all sorts of hidden areas, even in the main menu and credits. Extra content includes short story levels, silly stuff, rhythm-platforming, easter eggs, and pure rock-hard challenges.\n\nCONS:  Huge world.\nThe world is perhaps too big for its own good. Backtracking gets dull after a while and game's "fast travel" system is so contrived and inconvenient that it's often faster to just walk. Many areas are there just for the scenery, which some of you will find atmospheric while others will see it as boring filler.\n\nCharacters & Writing.\nThe biggest shocker for me. I was expecting a weird fairy tale, akin to Nifflas' other games. Instead I got angsty teen drama complete with swearing, daddy issues, relationship problems and more. It's like discovering that the big friendly Mickey Mouse you just took a picture with is now a fat sweaty dude in a back alley on his smoke break cracking dirty jokes with a colleague. While there is some interesting character development, the characters themselves act like they're from a completely different game.\nThis and this screenshot sum it up (spoiler free).\n\nStory & Quests.\nThe game pushes the idea that "it's not about the destination - it's about the journey", and it shows. Story and quests are simplistic and not really something to get excited about. The real "story" is exploring the world and learning about its inhabitants by completing their little errands. Don't get your hopes up for the big reveal - that's not what the "journey" is about and the game will make sure to remind you. (tip: if you're underwhelmed by the ending - one of the bonus levels does offer some closure).\n\nAlso the game never explains where the ball character came from, what it is, or what's its purpose. Even other characters don't seem to notice its presense. If you played Nifflas' other game - "Within a Deep Forest" - you'll know a bit about the ball's past, but present and future still remain a mystery.","December 24, 2015","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the main storyline may not be exactly brilliant, I found myself so fascinated with the world, the characters and the puzzles that I kept wanting to return, eager to see where my next adventure would take me.\nThis is much more of an exploration game than a puzzle one: it is not the destination that matters here but the journey itself, and there are dozens and dozens of secrets scattered around just waiting to be found, the characters are also surprisingly fun and well-written, and some puzzles very cleverly crafted.\nMy only complaint is that due to its open-worldy nature and the sometimes overwhelming freedom that you're given, the pacing will often feel a bit off.","January 16","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
