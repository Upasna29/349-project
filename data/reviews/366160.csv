Instead of BUFF it was put under as Netmarble games.\n\nThe game looks ok for what it is and it plays ok however there are a large amount of bugs that make the game unbearable.\n\nFor starts the games enemys can,will, and do quite often spam cross map grenade with pin point accuracy.\nThey also are literally aimbots in challenge mode and can do most of your health in damage before you can even move to some form of cover\n\nthere are also enemys that walk right through walls,cars,doors,buildings,barricades so on and so on.\n\nThe dodge roll in the game is for show and dosent really do much of anything in Pve other then use energy.\n\nEnemys that can grab you will do so from many feet away from you and either drag you back to where they are standing or simply teleport onto your person, Again dodge rolling away from them does nothing they will still garb you regardless.\n\nThe bosses in the game can knock down spam you to death along with many other enemys in the game doing the same to the point of getting knocked down while knocked down only to be then grabbed and knocked down again.\n\nThe more people you play with the more the enemy will do damage to you and get large almost silly amounts of extra health.\n\nHead shots in the game against the base enemy tend to blow there heads clean off but dosent outright kill said now headless enemy, Which then some how without said head can still find you and hit you with psychic melee attacks.\n\nSometimes your rounds do nothing to the enemy, they pass right through them and do not even bother to register an hit but take your ammo away regardless.\n\nEnemys can hit you with psychic melee attacks from many feet away from you much like the grabbing, Again dodge rolling does nothing and once they swing you are getting hit regardless.\n\nTo make endgame gear is a nearly insane, unreasonable amount of work to the point of taking a year or two of grinding out 1 and 2 bits of material per run of a game with a chance of getting nothing at the end of said game in terms of materials you need.\n\nHere is a list of the ingame requirements to make a tier 2 to tier 5 suit.\n\n19,250,000 gold\n\n6750 U tokens\n\n120 tool boxes (handmade cost 7200 rayon, fabric, epoxy, 960 Hrc steel)\n\n550 L tokens (handmade cost 5500 U tokens)\n\n850 A tokens (daily quest reward)\n\n5540 carbon steel (handmade cost 166200 Iron 55400 nicrome)\n\n100 memory alloy\n\n200 Alloy mat box (rare mat)\n\n1360 Hrc steel (handmade cost 27200 Nicrome 5440 carbon steel)\n\n200 shaped derivative additives (epic mat)\n\n250 super polymer bioactive resin (legendary mat)\n\n200 kevlar synthetic fiber\n\n166200 Iron\n\n82600 Nicrome\n\n7200 rayon\n\n7200 fabric\n\n7200 Epoxy\n\nat 375 hours of in game manufacture time for just the armor parts not even taking into account the time needed to make all the handmade mats. There is also a Limit to how much you can que up in said manufacture npc.\n\nAll items stack to 100 and you have very limited space in game for storage.\n\nitems needed to expand your storage and production ques are priced at 750,000 to 1,000,000 gold a pop.","February 2","false","37.9"," 115 of 145 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","115","145","7","2"

And yet I can hit a mob all the way in the distance with a headshot with the same rifle, and I'm not talking sniper rifles here.\n\nThere is work to be done by the devs, and then maybe there will be more players in the future. lets hope as the game has got a future (unlike Humanity).","April 5","true","44.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","1"

Just at very start that you need actualy to pay for game is lowering chances by 99% to have cheaters,hackers and those lovely trolls that speaks all possible languages than english.\n\n\nReviewHounds: The Last Hope is mixture of FPS and RPG, in a way it reminds me to old Shadowgate Londond from some reason,\nbut much better in any way, graphic,sound,gameplay...\nAltought it is multi-player game, you can easy play it solo (no bots), because game addopt dificulty of levels by number of players and it's levels. So you can play missions on your own with no problem.\n\n\nGameplay:\nI fell in love with game within first minutes of playing, very helpful tutorial to start and friendly community if you are stuck with something. Someone in game is always willing to help or answer any question you got.\nHowever at some points when you take many quests, and you got help or info pop outs, you can get your monitor overcrowded with text, ONLY outside missions.\nI will say in some way that this is one complete game, because I think devs implemented everything there is in it.\nRpg elements,FPs, crafting system, market, PVP, PVE, all kind of tasks and missions that will keep you playing this game until servers die from age ^^\nWhen I said friendly community, I mean it, beside positive attitude of players, while playing game everyone knows what to do, so dont be surprised finishing missions from first attempt.\n\nGraphic\nIs very very good. Awesome models, textures and animations, and it is good optimized that can work great on wooden PC's, just look at the bloody system req, It's a joke.\n\nSound:\nSame as graphic very very good. Enjoyable action music, awesome voice-acting, and overall in-game sound is great.\n\n\nOverall:\nGreat and fun game, definetly worth it's price, BUT regarding this DLC's is it a joke?! C'mon people 74eur for 2 DLC's ?\nI can't approve that, you can buy one if not two AAA games for that, and only so you can build high tier stuff.\nIn a way I may say OK to that if it had bloody more content in it. My recommendation and suggestion that DLC's like this should NEVER cost more than 4,99.\n\nI am highly recommending this game as a safe buy, BUT WITHOUT damn overpriced DLC's.","January 29","true","7.8"," 80 of 141 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","80","141","5","17"

I wouldn't invest in this game at full price, it is just not polished enough to warrant that but it is a fun game to while an hour or two away on.\n\nIt is fun and interesting to play. Graphics are okay but not spectacular and the game mechanics work quite well too. Each mission can be a bit varied from escorting to waves of enemies, to more objective based ones, to a Boss fight :)\n\nA few things I think this game is lacking is information on what and how to do things. Like for instance what are the "Luck Items" and how can you obtain them from the end mission reward screen if at all lol. How can we turn off that repetitive and annoying song that plays in our private room on a 30 second loop without nerfing all the ingame music?\n\nThe game is quite grindy to actually get anywhere in terms of gear, everything costs a fortune in ingame currency to produce and thats not including the materials. As said in other reviews there are some glitches like enemies being able to grab you from 8 feet away. But overall it is reasonably well balanced.\n\nAs with faults with this game: My first is the community it is not very accessible. Some players will only allow clan members into teams and you may find yourself kicked during party searches. I can understand it but considering the community is small I don't feel it is helpful or constructive to it's own growth.\nMy second fault are the developer updates... they are rather sparse in content. My hope is that in the coming future they will make the patches more extensive.\n\nBottom line, this game is fun and can be a welcome addition to your library but my advice is to join this game with a friend or two to make it a really fun experience which it can be :)\n\nUnderneath a few negative elements the devs have made a game that is enjoyable and entertaining to play. My only wish is that in future, the game will grow a bit more and be refined giving features like keymapping, music control and just more polish with new content!\n\n7/10","April 10","true","108.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Sure it have some small bugs on maps but its great to play a game like this. This game is totally different than the other games i played. Its easy to learn and u learn a new tactic to play a mission everytime u play a mission so for starters it have a good tutorial to cover most of the things and the story as usual and the crafting systems is a bit expensive but its suitable for a game like this.And there is CO-OP and PVP so u can choose each other playing grounds when u need to Go have some fun.Well i recommend this game for everyone Join and play u will see the difference! if u got trouble learning just give it a time and this game is new to the steam platform so even GM's are helping to play missions and they make loads of events just to get u hounders on board to survive and defeat the zombies and protect the mankind.Anyways I love this game, Thumbs up Hounds :D And goodluck with the Development :D Have a nice day !","April 5","true","868.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

It's filled with action and blood :) Sure it's a grindfest but that's very common these days. Only thing that's not so fun is the low population. For me The price has been worth it the 27gbp I paid, I would say that it should be a 14.99GBP game instead and it would probably attract more people.\n\nIt's sad, because the game is overall really cool and would most likely become bigger and better with more people playing it. So I hope others tag along, if you can afford it and spend a few hours then you'll probably like it and stay for a bit :)\n\nAlso I find this game very stable. Haven't crashed even once, haven't had any technical problems with it whatsoever.\nIt also works very well with SLI. But you need to go to the control panel and set it manually.\n\nIt looks cool, it's gory and it's got decent content.

Only avatar can make you look different but still the same if other people have it too\n- No dyes on weapons unless you buy the dlc ones\n- Controls cannot be changed ingame unless you mess with the ini file, this leads to some people cannot use space\n- Pvp ranks are quite grindy they could at least give it double exp rate\n\n\nExpect to grind alot to get tier 4 and 5 weapons. So far I have no problems with it but if you dont like grind games this game might not be for you.\n\nI have a lot of fun so I definitely recommend it.","April 16","true","147.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

If you think normal mission is too easy, then you will start changing your mind when playing Hard mission. Even with good equipments and high level, without good teamwork the squad will still being wipe out in no time.\n\nPVP are interesting and fun, but for some weapon it is too op and buggy as well.

You can be forgiven if you think the game sounds easily disregarded, but what you'd be missing is a fairly solid game that takes the standard 3PS model and does it right.\n\nThe first game I thought to compare it to was ZMR and so far it's still a fair comparison overall, however Hounds does not use a cover mechanic. Really, it doesn't NEED one. Unlike ZMR, which boasts are wide variety of enemies, Hounds has a fairly set type of enemies that the game has even gone through the trouble of labeling, classifying, and building *really bad* dialog around. This means that as you see certain (but not all) enemy types you actually have to change your tactics a bit, like when large monsters with shields make forward assaults nearly impossible or creatures with chainguns/rocket launchers have you scrambling for cover. (Remember, most of the time cover isn't important, so these guys basically pull the rug from under you) So unlike ZMR (save the boss fights and even then...) you actually have to use some tactical consideration during combat and even consider using the terrain effectively. (Choke points and possible cover should the ranged enemies arrive) When you add to this the otherwise standard 3PS combat it's actually fairly effective at keeping you involved in the combat.\n\nThe levels are considerably detailed, more so than I expected, and the music and atmosphere has a cinematic effect. Initially I almost expected this to become over-the-top but to my surprise it never really achieves that, keeping itself relatively serious throughout. This, in turn, actually creates some immersion I otherwise lose in 3PSs, even worse so MMO 3PSs. (DC Online, ZMR, APB, etc) While this is slightly hindered by otherwise dated graphics the limitations are actually still utilized well.\n\nNo cash shop. None. Zip. THIS pleased me. Oh, you have to pay for the game. No wonder. The game price is high and that's really one of the biggest problems with the game, but while playing I noticed something interesting: No Brazilians, no Russians, no hacking that I could witness, quiet and tolerable use of chat channels, etc. In other words, so far as I can tell the pay wall acts almost as a checkpoint or special entry door that prevents the crowd(s) that ruin other MMOs from entering this one. With that in mind, yes, a decent community in-game.\n\nVoice acting it bad. It's the same male (a Texan, I think) and female voice over and over. You get used to it, but it never fails to make me cringe a bit. It's not so much that it's a constant Texan but that there's no variety. Even worse is there are typos in the subtitles and other times the subtitles go by too fast or simply make no sense, so hearing the voice acting is really the only way of understanding what's going on if you, in fact, WANT to understand what's going on.\n\nAll in all this is a solid game and a lot of fun. I can see it being more fun with friends you can talk to but not doing so doesn't really harm the game any. If the game is on sale it's worth it, or if it brings the price down in the near future. The only negative to that is, as mentioend, if that happens be mindful that the in-game community might suffer for it.","January 31","true","54.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Join the Hounds and be part of the last hope of mankind!\n\nHounds: The Last Hope is Third Person Shooter/MMO/RPG game where you take control of a member of the Hounds unit forces. At the start, you will play a tutorial mission which will teach you how to use the game controls and initiate you into the storyline with good cut scenes.\n\nThen you’ll create your first character (possibility of creating up to 5) and will have four classes to choose from: Assault, Specialist, Support or Tech. Each one has specific attributes attached to them. As you finish your character creation, you’ll find yourself in a town (a lobby, if you like) where you can access quests from a large number of individuals. The armoury and your own private room will be available to you. In the private room you will be treated with a funky soundtrack and while your character is sitting down puffing on a ♥♥♥, you will be able to access plenty of options: the mail system, storage, shop, consignment sales, upgrade and crafting weapons and more.\n\nWhen you are ready to play a mission, you will create or join a room and then jump into the thick of it. The gameplay is really impressive - whether you play by yourself or in Co-op (up to 6 people in the group), it is fast and fluid. Each time you kill an enemy you will get points. As you go along in the mission, you will reach at least 3 spots where you will be able to re-supply ammunition or repair your weapons. Make sure you get all the orange boxed along the way as they have coins and other goodies in them. At the end of the mission, you will be presented with a set of 6 cards and each of them has a specific a reward attributed to it. Then they will be shuffled and you will need to choose one - hopefully you will receive the one you want the most. Additional rewards, yeah!  Talking about rewards, each day you login in you will get a reward as well as each hour you play in the row.\n\n5 PVP modes available in Hounds: sabotage, occupation, annihilation, close Combat and death match.\n\nGraphically this game is really good and easy to master in regards to the controls. The soundtracks is great and to be honest with you this game is just missing you! The only thing I am a bit disappointed about is the voice over. It is ok but could have been better.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great graphics\n-	Plenty of missions\n-	Good interface, crafting, upgrade, mail, storage etc\n-	Fun and addictive\n-	In game achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No Steam trading cards / achievements\n-	Voice over could have been better\n\nHounds: The Last Hope is a fun and addictive MMO third Person Shooter. Come on ladies and Gents, join the Hounds and save the world!\n\n8.9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

From what I've seen no one has bought it) and a great community.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated looks like something that came out like 3-4 years ago.\n\nThe gameplay itself is kinda like a good version of Operation: Raccoon City as you have a mix of zombie melee classed enimies and then you have the ranged solider type bad guys so it gives nice pacing from craping yourself with over-swarms of zombies to a semi-tactical shooter when you have advanced AI troopers attempting to gun you down.\n\nOverall:\nPositives:\n+Fun to play\n+ An amazing amount of content\n+ Good crafting and upgrading system\n+ Co-op is fun and challenging with 2-6 players and more players = more challenging with more monsters and advanced enimies spawn\n+ Nice competitive PVP (Unlike the free-to-play where it's P2W)\n+ Voice acting is good\nNegatives:\n- Dated graphics\n- Due to the price not many people actually play the game (even though it's actually quite fun)\n- The Price (If you can find it anywhere cheaper then go get it.

There's no avoiding that statement and I may as well get it out of the way quickly.  The Controls are loose and janky, the shooting doesn't feel responsive, and the aesthetics waver between Grimy and Icky.\n\nReading through other reviews, the grind allegedly gets pretty bad and it's not really solo-friendly but it's a Korean MMO so I'm not sure what those people expected.\n\nThe Voice work is touted as being professional in the store page and that might actually be true, technically.  Actually, the voice work is fine, I blame the direction and the writing.\n\nWith that said, the game is Charming despite its many flaws.  After you get through the tutorial stage, you get dumped into the character creation screen and the music that plays during that is pretty KICKING RAD and I'll admit that it got me pretty pumped up to play the game.  Bashing obstacles generally involves you sparta kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of a crate and that will always feel really good.\n\nTL;DR: The game is really close to something I'd actually try to con my friends (I don't have friends but work with me here) into playing but it's not something I'm going to ask someone else to drop 30+ bucks on just so I have someone to play with.","April 4","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can really see that the creators of the game really wanted to try to balance the game, especially with assualt class. The shield and pistol combo is obviously a valid tactic that has great DPS and allows you to act as a wall for your teammates. The PVP is very balanced and the character customization is so indepth that I still wonder if I could have gone back and adjusted one little thing here and there. My favorite part about the game is when you get close to NPCs they actually acknowledge your presence and start welcoming you in their own way. They don't use words but you can really feel their energy through the sounds they make. The game has so many armor styles that I have never actually seen anyone else with anything close to what my armor looks like. I can definitely reccommend this game to anyone into action and horror game genres. The realism is so intense that the game litterally leaves me in tears. This game respects women by the way it shows them as not always barbie dolls. They actually have body mass and they don't have unrealistically large chests. There are so many people playing this game all the time I feel like I'm walking through a dense city everytime I log in. Not to mention the music is all original and it's definitely not the same song repeating again and again for an eternity. It doesn't have bugs like other zombie games where the zombies will litterally run right through walls. I've never played a game THIS good. But don't buy it now, these developlers deserve the full $35 dollars they usually charge for this game.\n\n𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:\nFor people who haven't played this game yet, it may not be entirely obvoius that this is a sarcastic review. I personally think this game is awful and that you should not buy it. It has many bugs, NPCs litterally make sexual moans if you get too close, the graphics look earlier than 2005 graphics, zombies run straight through buildings, there is little to no balance, very few people accually play this version of the game, women will destroy any kind of immersion this game might produce by wearing very skimpy clothes, the voice acting can physically harm you, and the characters scripts appear to be done by a grade schooler.\n\n... And if you do get the game, don't choose assualt or use the pistol shield combo. It's just bad. The pistol doesn't accually do any damage and it has the worst accuracy in the game. The shield itself doesn't block very much damage at all.","April 9","false","2.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","42","5","12","6","3"

But i think it's actually enjoyable.  It reminds me of FUSE and Left 4 Dead in a sense, maybe  throw in a little bit of Lost Planet.  I really like how simple the gameplay is, and it's something there to kill time with a few random people after a stressful day of work.\n\nPros:  It's an enjoyable shooter with manageable mechanics.  It's quick to get into.  There are reasonable amounts of customization options at the beginning, and I hope more are on the way.\n\nCons:  The graphics are OLD... i mean, almost PS1 old.  The voice acting is appalling, either they try too hard, or hardly try.  I swear, someone probably just said, "F#!* it, let's ham it up," the rest is for your listening pleasure. I mean, some of the lines are just laughable...\n\nVerdict:  It's a solid shooter with plenty of action.  Not the best graphic or sound quality, and the story seems cliche and recycled.  But it's still FUN.   If you're looking to kill time and the undead with a few friends, this game is for you.\n\nA solid  6.5 / 10","January 31","true","1.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","1"

I feel it's more of a $10.00 dollar range game, especially considering it is very similar to ZMR and that is a f2p game. Hounds is a fun little action game though, with really good graphics. The visuals blow ZMR out of the water, but the over $30.00 price tag, just kills it. There is simply just not enough game to justify the expense, therefore I cannot recommend it.","February 23","false","3.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

It has a lot more gameplay variety than the Killing Floor series. Art direction is a cheap Chinese knockoff of the Resident Evil series, but at least you can make a customizable hot chick. It seems to be made in China or Korea.\n\nPositives:\n- The Steam version of this game has no cash shop. Everything can be obtained through the in-game currency.\n- Gameplay is pretty fun. You shoot hordes of different kinds of zombies and aliens, and get good feedback for both body shots and headshots. There is also a lot more variety than the whole Killing Floor series.\n- The girls are pretty decent. There is also a good variety of races - if you have yellow fever, then luckily for you this game was obviously made in China or Korea. You can also create white, ebony, and latina characters.\n- Playable both solo and co-op, with up to six players per co-op mission. It has a Clan and Friends system, to ensure that you can continue to play with lots of people.\n- PvP matches for those who like to have PvP in their co-op games.\n\nNegatives:\n- Made in China or Korea = poor English. Voices seem to have been written by an American, then subtitled in Chinese/Korean, then the subtitles were translated back to English. User Interface requires some translation from the game terms to common English. It takes effort to understand what non-voiced NPCs are saying.\n- If you play it as a solo game - then it doesn't have the shiniest graphics that you would expect from a AAA game. Graphics and animations are only "good enough", but at least they put a lot of work into the female characters.\n- There seems to be only one female body shape. Very unlike many other MMOs like Tera and Warframe, where you could get both curvy and slim female shapes.","January 29","true","5.7"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","6","18","2","0"

Each situation, you can hear their voices racked with anger, despair, sorrow and fear. As they speak, you feel immersed in the plot and it is almost as if you are there, with them, by their side. You can smell the smoke in the air, the charred flesh, and the smell of the yellow rain as it drips down the undersides of your legs. Each time you hear the characters speak, you feel a tear sliding out from under your eyelid and slowly roll its way down your cheek.\n\nNot only this, but the wiki has got it point on when they say that the Assault class is the strongest class with his Shield & Pistol weapon combo, utilizing the strongest DPS and strongest defense.\n\nThe quote from the Wiki page:\n"Assault is the tank on each team standing between enemies and allies.\nUsing the Shield & Pistol, the Assault class is not just a wall but also has strong DPS.\nThis is a well balanced class between offense and defense."\n\nThis couldn't be more true! The Shield & Pistol are so ridiculously overpowered that they seriously need a nerf. This game is so unbalanced with the Shield & Pistol around! Everytime I enter a PvP match, I end up facing someone utilizing the Shield & Pistol and they absolutely destroy me within a couple shots. Even with my minigun and grenade launcher at my disposal, they just glance at me and I feel fear shaking me down to my boots. I feel my bladder letting loose as I stare at this man holding a fearsome shield and pistol.\n\nOther people might tell you that the Tech class might be the most overpowered, but they've got it wrong. Nobody can beat the Assault class and his overpowering DPS with his Shield & Pistol combo.\n\n\nPros:\n- The reticles are amazing, the pistols are all overpowered (not as much as the Shield & Pistol, of course!)\n- Wickbrokes can just clip straight through walls and be at your side when you need them!\n- The grenade launcher is an exact representaiton of how it operates in a real life situation!\n- The minigun is not OP at all, it is by far the most underwhelming weapon in the game!\n- SMGs are so ridiculous with their incredibly high recoil and it is nigh impossible to aim with them.\n- The game is buy-to-play!\n- There are so many people online that you feel like you're in the real world, except online!\n- The pump-action shotgun and the bolt-action sniper rifles are the third best weapons in the game!\n- Sprinting looks so real and authentic.\n- Mobs have 100% accuracy with guns and grenades! Amazing coding!\n- Mobs really want to give you a hug from an astounding 10 feet away! What long arms you have, grandma! (All the better to hug you with, my dear ♥).\n- Rolling is the most useful thing in the game.\n- No jumping allowed! We wouldn't want to make you a bigger target, now would we?\n- Best voice acting in any game 2016. The voice acting is so excellent and emotional that you can't help but go back and play it over and over again!\n- The subtitles and the dialogue are 100% matching!\n- Mobs can hold you in an eternal stun lock until you die!\n- Just a cheap cheap price of $34.99!\n\n\nCons:\n- None!\n\n-------------------\n\nSummary:\nGo play this game! Its normal price is a mere $34.99 and it's well worth the price!","April 9","true","15.8"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","0"
