"http://steamcommunity.com/id/die_alpha/recommended/238210/","die_alpha","Die Alpha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/die_alpha/","148 products in account","The cult classic sci-fi horror FPS-RPG has returned.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is an interesting game to review in 2014. When it first came out in 1999, it was met with a lot of praise from the gaming press, winning over a dozen awards, including several “Game of the Year” titles, and since then it has appeared on several “Greatest Games of All Time” lists. However despite the praise, not many people actually bought and played it.\n\nIt feels like System Shock 2 has been granted a second chance though. The success Irrational Games has had with BioShock and BioShock: Infinite has interested people enough to want to check out System Shock 2, which was the first game Irrational created. This is great news, because while you might not expect it, I feel that System Shock 2 is the best of all the “Shock” games. It makes you realize that for all of the steps forward we have taken in terms of technology, in a lot of ways modern gameplay has taken a few steps backwards.\n\nSystem Shock 2 takes place aboard the world’s first Faster Than Light starship the Von Braun as well as the UNN heavy destroyer the Rickenbacker which was tethered to the Von Braun so it could make the FTL jumps as well. You, the player, wake up from Cryo Sleep 5 months after the ship has left earth. It appears that while you were sleeping some force has managed to hijack the ship. You spend much of the game trying to figure out what exactly happened while you were sleeping, getting ship systems back up and running, and coming up with a plan to stay alive. The primary story of the game is told through many audio logs scattered around the ship that were left by the dead crewmembers, as well as visual clues in the levels that shed some light on what has been going on. This was one of the first games to do this, which has only recently started to become popular.\n\nBoth the Von Braun and Rickenbacker are both pretty large ships, and the game does not have any real “levels” in the traditional sense. The ships are broken up into decks (medical, engineering, hydroponics, operations, etc), and each of those decks are broken up into sectors that are separated by bulkheads which often require keycards to access. You are always free to move back and forward between decks and sectors you have gained access to. The game treats the ships as one large persistent game world. For example, if you come across some heavy armor that you do not have the required strength to equip, you can always come back to it later once you have the required stats. Or if you drop an item in a hallway that you do not have space in your inventory for, you can come back and get it hours later if you feel the need to. In fact, this sort of back tracking is sometimes necessary, as certain areas of the ship are only accessible after you do something in a different area. While the game in linear as far as some areas are locked until you find the keycard or access codes, it often lets you tackle multiple objectives in whatever order you see fit.\n\nSpeaking of stats like strength, the game has an interesting RPG like system that determines what you can and cannot do. As you complete objectives, you are granted access to “Cybernetic Modules” that you use to upgrade your cybernetic implants. You spend these points at upgrade stations around the ship. There are four main categories of upgrades: stats, psi, weapons, and tech. Stats include things like strength, endurance, and agility. The weapons category contains sub-categories such as standard weapons, heavy weapons, and energy weapons. The tech category is where you find the skills associated with hacking, repairing, and modifying. The Psi category has five separate tiers of power, which need not be learned in order. Each tier includes seven individual powers. These powers compare pretty favorably to the plasmids from Bioshock, and include abilities like Photonic Redirection (turning yourself invisible), Enhanced Motion Sensitivity (shows enemies nearby), and Projected Pyrokinesis (shoots a ball of fire).\n\nThe game has more gameplay systems then just the skills. Let’s use the weapons as an example. Each weapon as multiple fire modes that have strengths and weaknesses, such as an overload shot for a laser pistol that does more damage but is energy inefficient. On top of this, each weapon can be modified, provided you have the appropriate skill level. Examples of modification include increasing the clip size, increasing the rate of fire and decreasing kickback. Each time you fire a weapon, its condition starts to degrade, and you must use maintenance tools to keep the weapon in working order. If you neglect a weapon long enough, it can actually break. At that point you need to repair the weapon before you can use it again. On top of this, many of the guns have different types of ammo such as armor piercing rounds and anti-personnel rounds. How does one know what type of ammo to use against each enemy? That is where researching comes in.\n\nWhen you kill enemies, they often leave behind organs that you can collect from their bodies. If you have a high enough research level, you can research these organs to learn more about the enemies you are facing. It will tell you what types of weapons they have resistances to, which types of weapons they are extra vulnerable to, and it will also give you a buff to all damage done to them. Researching isn’t limited to enemy organs either. You will often find exotic weapons and items that you cannot use until you have researched what they are. Researching items requires different chemicals as well. Which chemicals are required depends on the item. Each deck of the ship has a chemical storeroom that contains a selection of most (but not all) of the chemicals that you need for research. If you are researching an item that requires a chemical that is not in the storeroom on your current deck, you will need to locate the proper chemical somewhere else.\n\nSince System Shock 2 is a survival horror game at its core, you spend a lot of time managing and rationing your supplies. You don’t always want to fight every enemy you come across, otherwise you might find yourself out of ammo. Running from or sneaking by enemies are always valid tactics. You can sometimes take more creative approaches as well, such as hacking a turret and baiting enemies into its firing range. There are also vending machines located throughout the ship, which you can spend money (Nanites) that you collect on items such as ammo and health. Not every vending machine sells everything, and you can hack the vending machines to offer you better prices. Nanites are also the currency used to hack, modify, and repair items, so it is up to you to determine the best way to use your supply of them.\n\nAll of these layered gameplay systems are what make System Shock 2 stand out as surprisingly modern when compared to current games. Even Bioshock, a critically acclaimed modern game, feels a bit shallow when you compare it to System Shock 2. I would even go as far as to say Bioshock is a watered down version of System Shock 2. This complexity also opens the game up to be played multiple times, and each time you can build your character in drastically different ways. Want to play the game as a stealth character, only killing when absolutely necessary? That’s possible. What to build a melee weapons only character? That’s also possible.\n\nThe only thing about System Shock 2 that feels dated are the visuals, and even that can be mitigated to some degree with mods. The story is great, the audio design is both haunting and impactful when it needs to be, and the gameplay was so far ahead of its time that even modern games feel shallow in comparison. If you can get over how the game looks, I would absolutely recommend giving this first person survival horror RPG a try. It might just be your 2014 game of the year… from 1999.","January 9, 2014","true","161.0"," 833 of 852 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","833","852","0","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/238210/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","System Shock 2 really is one of the best games ever made.  It's one of those games where all the elements mesh together so well that it still manages to be a great game 10+ years after release.  There are graphic mods available which I highly recommend (check the game hub for a guide) though they definitely aren't necessary to enjoy the game.\n\nThe gameplay is a mesh of FPS and RPG similar to Deus Ex, though gun accuracy does not suffer due to a low skill level.  Many objects are interactible and you will need to utilize mouse interfaces quite often.  One unique thing about the game is that it does not pause when interacting so you need to be aware of your surroundings so you are not attacked while doing so.\n\nThe game uses the old-school style of giving you objectives without marking exactly where they are so you need to pay attention to where you're going and what you're doing.  The one thing I wish the game had was markers on the map for mission locations once you discover them as it can be difficult to find them again when you need them.\n\nThere is a good variety of weapons for melee, ranged, and psi combat.  The guns are very accurate unlike Deus Ex, though the recoil can throw off your aim.  Melee combat is definitely a weak spot in the game with the range and hitbox being very short and unclear, as well as the melee attacks being quite slow.  There is an overhead attack upgrade you can get that unfortunately makes these problems worse.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in the atmosphere, writing, and of course, SHODAN.  Even with the very dated graphics, this game manages to be the creepiest game I have ever played.  I admit I have not yet played Amnesia, but I do believe System Shock 2 could give it a run for its money.  SHODAN is an amazing character, and really adds to that atmosphere as well.\n\nAbout the game difficulty: I've heard many people say the game is too hard.  I didn't have much trouble though I am very experienced with FPS's.  I do know that psi builds are very difficult compared to others.  Total completion time: ~12 hours.\n\nPlay this game!  You will not regret it.","August 26, 2013","true","14.1"," 164 of 173 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","164","173","0","1"

After a few short (and, thankfully, optional) tutorial VR simulations, you chose one of three 'classes': a gun-wielding Marine, a psi-power controlling Psi-Op (otherwise known as a wizard!), or the middle-of-the-two Navy -- and are then dutifully assigned to the Von Braun on its and humanity's maiden faster-than-light voyage. Put into cyrogenic sleep until needed, you are rudely awakened to find your memory erased and the ship seemingly empty, barring a Doctor Janice Polito who offers you help over your communicator. You quickly find that a force of seemingly alien beings have taken control of the ship and its system-controlling AI (along with a fair amount of the on-board monkey population!), as you and Polito form an alliance to try and regain control of the ship...or at the very least re-enable the needed systems to call for help.\n\nThe game plot initially focuses on your player-character receiving orders from Pollotio, who's quite handily barricaded in her room on the Operations deck. With a primary objective of attempting to reach her and call for help/escape, she keeps you updated with any objectives that need to be fulfilled to gain access to further areas of the ship and slow down the advance of the enemy where possible. I say 'initially focuses on' as things soon change, and, without spoiling anything, System Shock 2 will spin the story on its head -- and treat you to one of the most wonderfully constructed plot-twists in gaming history (well, it had more of a kick in 1999, anyway). It isn't ground-breaking story-wise, but it's exceptionally executed, and has left an impression on everyone who's ever played it; Ken Levine certainly engrossed right from the beginning.\n\nThe Von Braun itself is split into several different sections, each deck providing a different function for the on-board science crew, and each providing you a different type of environment to explore; from the cramped and radioactive engineering deck to the more open shopping and recreational deck, each section feels individual -- although all of the decks feel as cold and oppressive as you'd imagine a floating tin-can to be. Make no mistake though, the game is quite linear: objectives rarely span more than one deck, allowing you to constantly pursue and explore new and interesting areas -- however you may wish to back-track across previously-visited decks to research artifacts and weapons which will provide you with bonuses for later on.\n\nWhile there are a few survivors dotted around, you never really interact with them; most of the plot is advanced through either the environment, with words written in blood covering the walls -- or through voice-logs and emails of the recently dead, much like in the game's spiritual successor, Bioshock. You're never taken out of the game; you're always in first-person perspective, and always quite alone...with mainly just the voices of the dead to keep you company!\n\nSystem Shock 2 isn't all roses though, especially with age. Games have moved on quite a bit, and without nostalgia to help ignore the flaws, new-comers might find the low-polygon creatures a little cartoonish, the graphics a little underwhelming, and generally just lacking the kind of polish you find nowadays. The game-play itself requires a more cautious-than-usual approach too -- not quite as cautious as the Thief series, but not quite as guns-blazing as most first person shooters -- which may put some off.\n\nIf you're not afraid of rough edges and want to experience one of gaming's classic playgrounds, black out your room, slip on some surround-sound headphones, and enjoy.","November 25, 2013","true","15.7"," 158 of 174 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","158","174","0","0"

It's regarded as one of the best games for PC ever made, as well as one of the best for its genre... and it is wholly deserving of all its praise. System Shock 2 is a game that defies any real review, to do so would to really spoil the experience. It needs to be played to understand why it is so good, and that is what playing it is: an experience.\n\nThe game is a rare example of design, gameplay, aesthetic, atmosphere, and presentation all working in near perfect harmony to deliver an engrossing experience that pulls you in and keeps you going until the final hours are passed. The RPG elements are almost completely free form, allowing you to build your character in almost any way you like focusing on what you want as you want it (though in the early game you'll do well to focus on your initial strengths as to not spread yourself too thin), and while initial enemy placement is pre-determined you'll find out that they respawn with alarming frequency in random numbers and placements to constantly keep you on your toes.\n\nThe game is not perfect, mind, and has some flaws. Most notable are the level designs for the final areas of the game don't seem quite as well designed as the rest of the game and some other small nitpicks, but these are minor gaffes in System Shock 2's excellent imageand are easily forgiven. If you like science fiction, survival horror, cyberpunk, body or eldritch horror, free form RPGs, first person shooters, adventure games, or any combination thereof of them, then System Shock 2 is well deserving of your attention.

Anyone familiar with the game will already have their mind made up on it, and it's often hard to convince those who aren't to try it. I haven't played System Shock 2 since its release ages ago, and I'm happy to report that it holds up surprisingly well for newcomers and veterans alike. Not for the whole game, sadly, but for enough of it.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is one of the originators of the FPS/RPG genre, which spun out Deus Ex, Vampire, Bioshock, and all manner of dense shooters. You play a hacker stashed aboard the USS Von Braun, mankind's first faster-than-light starship. It becomes immediately apparent that issues have arisen during the voyage, and it's up to you to hopefully make things right. You do this by scavenging weapons and gadgets, hacking devices, upgrading your skills, researching the odd artifacts you come across, and killing lots of really, really freaky monsters. There's an enormous range of activities involved in growing your character, and a little of everything is required to keep up with the surprisingly varied enemies you encounter.\n\nThe story is among the best the FPS genre has ever seen, detailing the final hours of the Von Braun's crew and leading you through every nook and cranny of the enormous ship. A competent minimap and extensive log of the audio files you find through the game help keep you on track as you progress through the ruined decks. Unfortunately, the game starts to come apart after you leave the Von Braun. The open maps and fully-realized levels give way to isolated setpieces and cramped, confusing halls filled with monsters. It's very clear the back end of the game was rushed, and it suffers terribly for it. Abuse of the quicksave system is a must near the end, which sadly drains a lot of the tension from the game.\n\nIt really cannot be overstated how good the atmosphere is either, which makes its collapse near the end all the more tragic. The sound design is incredible, with unsettling cues popping up at all the right times. Well, except for the music which you should mute immediately, unless you have an irrational love for 90s programmer techno. Even the graphics hold up, with the bold colors and boxy designs masking the incredibly low-res textures. You'll feel like an idiot the first time a chunky-looking enemy makes you jump, but your heart will be pounding too much to care.\n\nIt very much is a classic for a reason, and the precipitous drop in quality near the end still can't sully the first 8 or so hours. It's a long, long game, with plenty of secrets and scares to keep you engaged. If you've never played System Shock 2 I guarantee you're in for a treat, and if you haven't replayed it recently I can still promise the same.","October 4, 2015","true","10.6"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","68","70","0","4"

For one, it's damned frustrating and very difficult and takes quite a bit of patience, even on its easier difficulties, so if you're one to easily get put on tilt, this game isn't for you. Also, if you're obsessive over graphics, this game is not for you, because while there are add-ons that improve the graphics, the game still doesn't look nearly as good as modern games, with the one exception maybe being the corridor lighting, which still look fairly good today. System Shock 2 is an incredibly tense and scary experience; the game literally plays with your paranoia, with enemies that you can hear from far away and constant enemy respawn, you will never really feel safe. Unlike other select survival horror titles, the classic System Shock 2 can scare while still having excellent gameplay; it was one of the first titles (if not the first) to effectively merge the first person shooter and rpg genres. Additionally, it has open-world style level design that feels claustrophobic and fresh to this day and for days to come.\n\nThough most would agree that the majority of System Shock 2 is excellent, everybody who has played the full game will know what I am talking about when I say that the end bosses (which I won't spoil) are terrible. The unanimous consensus is generally that the ending is downright awful too; even people who enjoyed the ending (myself included) would tell you that it's only enjoyable because of how terrible and cheap it is.\n\nThat being said, what are you waiting for? Go play System Shock 2, but only if you plan on playing it in its entirety, from start to finish.","June 29, 2015","true","37.3"," 73 of 79 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","73","79","5","1"

In her limitless imagination, SHODAN saw herself as a goddess, destined to inherit the Earth. That image was snuffed out by the hacker who created her...\n\nIn September 1994 Looking Glass Studios shocked the PC gaming world. Famous for their work on Ultima Underworld, they had decided to branch out into the realm of science fiction, and so System Shock was born. Thought it was never commercially successful, its successful blend of sci-fi action and horror gained a massive cult following. In 1999 Looking Glass partnered with Irrational Games to produce a sequel, System Shock 2. It also fared about the same commercially as it's predecessor, quickly becoming a cult classic as well. To this day original copies are still highly sought out by collectors, often fetching exorbitantly high prices. However thanks to the efforts of a mysterious hacker named le Corbeau, System Shock 2 has now been remastered and re-released on Steam with full compatibility for modern PCs.\n\nSystem Shock 2 takes place a full 42 years after the events of the original game. As the events on Citadel Station fade into memory, the Faster-Than Light starship Von Braun is on its maiden voyage, and you are a soldier assigned to the military vessel Rickenbacker to provide security during the Von Braun's shakedown run. Things however do not go as planned, and all hell breaks loose. You awaken with amnesia some time after everything has gone south, and it is up to you to try and find out what fate has befallen the two ships and their crews. The stunningly written narrative is presented to you by audio logs and emails left behind by crew members, and it serves as a chilling reminder of how alone you truly are out here in space.\n\nGameplay-wise, System Shock 2 is quite similar to its predecessor, seemingly being a first person shooter at first glance. Once you get into the fray however, it quickly becomes apparent that LGS has created a seamless blend of RPG and survival horror. The controls may seem a bit strange at first, but they add a whole range of movements rarely seen in the genre. However if you want a more traditional WASD setup, you can quickly remap everything to your liking. Near infinite possibilities exist to customize your character as the game progresses, letting you mold your game experience to suit your playing style.\n\nIf there are any failings that I could point out about the original System Shock 2 it would be the limited video options and a handful of rampant bugs that can seriously put a damper on what can be considered to be the greatest game ever made. However the Steam release fixes all of these problems, and has completely redefined the experience. If System Shock 2 is the king of all sci-fi horror games, then consider this to be an extra layer of polish on its crown. If you consider yourself at all to be a PC gamer, then you owe it to yourself to buy this game. There is still nothing currently out there that can match it, and there likely will not be for a very long time.","November 25, 2013","true","1.6"," 91 of 124 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","91","124","0","0"

Infact it's almost an EXACT CLONE of this game (and whats the first weapon? That's right kids, it's the wrench).  You say "EVE", I say "PSI". You say upgrade stations? i say upgrade stations, aaaannd finally you say ADAM i say cyborg points. Fans will also notice a rather large "Dead Space" feel as well and to be honest, many think that Dead Space was in early development going to be System Shock 3... (if this is so, THANK YOU STAR INSURANCE! WE LOVE YOU FOR NOT LETTING THIS HAPPEN! *ahem*).\n\nThe graphics (to some) are low budget and a little to old, as well as the models (we shall ignore these people, they are fools). However saying this the lighting and levels themselves still manage to give it a dark, moody atmosphere walking round the cyberpunk infused science vessel "INNNNN SPAAAAAACE!" (and i deny ANYONE to say cyborg mid-wives have lost their freaky edge). Also, in true old-style FPS fasion, there are alot of keys to use to the untrained eye, however players soon realise they are not mandatory and to be honest are there only for other play styles from that era (believe it or not some players used to use keyboard ONLY on fps back then... I know can you believe that?).\n\nSo yes for new and old gamers BUY THIS, either on GOG or here. Doesn't matter, its worth it and if you dont like the graphics then there are literally 15 years worth of mods (many of which got updated due to it's re-release) and yes as its Night Dive the community did most of the work for them and as usual, used it :/ (you will notice this recuring pattern with them) so they could not F"$% this one up even if they tried to.\n\nAlso once again, thank you star insurance for making sure no one took this and "EA'ed" in all these years (fingers crossed this new one won't do this either... ).","October 26, 2015","true","59.5"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","0"

Though it didn't take off in the mainstream til Deus Ex and Bioshock. SS2 remains as legendary as the careers it jumpstarted.\n\nEverything about SS2 basically took a defibrilator to the original game and kickstarted it into overdrive. The plot was expanded to the point of reading like the good Aliens sequel we never got. The gameplay was treated like both an actual RPG and an engaging first person shooter, complete with unique ever changing environments and weapons.\n\nBut that's not even touching the surface of this game. The most memorable aspect of SS2 is it's horror atmosphere. The electronica soundtrack only adds to the tension of how scary this game is. Enemies shuffle and appear in corridors you thought you cleared already, weapons jam if you don't take care of them, and you're constantly searching and praying to find someone alive. But unfortunately as you search, it seems more and more likely you're the only one still human.\n\nSS2 is truly a work of art, and it's great to see it fixed up and running in modern resolutions. Considering how often this game goes on sale, you owe it to yourself to see where Bioshock and Dead Space all got it from.

I had never and have never played the original System Shock but that never put me off. I'd seen and heard good things so I was eager to try it out. And try it out I did! So, what did I think?\n\nIt blew my F**KING mind! So complex and way ahead of its time. The first FPS I had played with an inventory system, audio logs and options to upgrade your statistics. It was very different to other shooters I had played. This was in a whole new league. Graphically it looked really good with music that complemented the eerie feel of the game. Speaking of eerie, this game is scary. The voices of the enemies is creepy and I'm not even going to mention the psychic monkeys, lest I break into a fit of pure terror. Combat is good though you must maintain your weapons if you don't want them to break. Melee combat feels slow and clunky.\nThe story... ah the story. From beginning to end the narrative manages to hold your attention and takes you on a great adventure, exploring every nook and cranny of your environment. The 'female' antagonist is one of the best ever portrayed in a video game.\n\nA truly fantastic game back in 1999 and a great game now in 2015.

Sites all over the net made it clear this is a must play game, being in numerous top 10 games of all time and top 10 RPGs of all time lists. And I have to say it's certainly made mine too!\n\nFor starters the setting; Sci-fi/Cyberpunk. It looks great! Obviously to today's standards the graphics are poor but if you're like most sane and decent gamers you won't let that stop you from playing it. If it makes you feel any better there are mods to improve the graphics, but I always recommend playing games vanilla first time through to get the intended feel of the game.\n\nThe game is a First-person shooter/Roleplaying hybrid that is well known with classic Looking Glass games. Again to today's standards the combat may be a little but clunky but overall get's the job done. My only minor nitpick is the wrench as it's so damn annoying to attack smaller enemies because it's constantly missing! In terms of roleplaying you have a lot to work with, with the potential for 3 different types of characters it adds a lot of replay value as well as the potential for many character builds. Personally I went in as the typical soldier/'warrior' build and just beefed up on strength and my guns but you could master tech hacking your way through levels opening chests and disabling security or you could us PSI (Psionics - Imagine it as System Shocks 'magic') This type of character gives you tonnes of skills like shields, telekinesis, firing projectiles and so much more. So many potential character builds and different ways to approach the game.\n\nSystem Shock 2 also comes under another genre, survival horror. Now for the most part I'd say it is a First-person shooter, action roleplaying game, However the atmosphere in most of the levels of this game is intense. The enemies themselves creep around the decks of the ship stalking you and I'm not going to lie they made me jump and made me scream like a little girl on numerous occasions, especially earlier in the game when I felt underpowered. The way the NPCs speak is also quite chilling at times. I would say however that as the game progresses, some of the later levels lose that horror edge, but it doesn't completely detract from the game.\n\nNow a few final things to finish up on. The major thing I disliked about this game was movement, again It's an old game, old engine, old physics etc, but getting stuck in tiny nooks and crannies was seriously frustrating (I'm looking at you last levels!) And although I love the climbing in this game (It works like Thief) some times it was unresponsive and unpredictable.\n\nAnd of course we can't forget the story. It's great, It's not the best story but it's certainly good and I think you should experience it for yourself!\n\nSystem Shock 2 - 9/10","January 9, 2015","true","31.4"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","1"

Why? Because otherwise it would spoil everything.

This is just for old-timers.\n\nIn short:\nEvery game you play (from FPS to RPGs) has been directly or indirectly been inspired by this true masterpiece. So if you do not have it, well it's like missing Dante's Trilogy in your home library (well not that so, but say something like a must-have).\n\nOkay this looks like a game with inefable emotions attached to it.

System Shock 2. Mixing RPG, FPS, Survival Horror and Adventure.\n\nAfter 30 years, TriOptimums went to bankruptcy and all the stock was bought by a Russian company named A. Korenchkin, who restored the company after a decade and its signing now weapon contracts with politicians and military organizationes.\n\nThen 12 after the events in Citadel TriOptimum is restored, in fact is now testing a new FTL ship, called the Von Braun which is not alone. Another ship is following it, named Rickenbacker. Why? Simple, Rickenbacker does not have a FTL device, so it needs to be "attached" to the Von Braum for the trip.\n\n5 months after and you´ll wake up in your cryo-tube inside the Von Braum to find out that something has happened there...\n\n\nThis is just an introduction about the plot, which is very interesting. Now lets move to the gameplay.\n\n\nSystem Shock uses the Dark Engine (yep the same as Thief: Dark Project) but it is slightly different. It wasnt finished so the programmers were fixing bugs when encountered. BUT this only makes things better, because they were working closely with the engine code allowing them to "create" or "write" additional features. Thats why we said that the Dark Engine in SS2 is the Enhanced Dark Engine. In addition to this fact the DE (Dark Engine) was able to display a wide variety of colored lighting, thats why SS2 uses some tricks with lighting and sounds to create a perfect atmosphere of terror.\nThe worst part about the DE is the limit in the polygons (only 1024), but this can be fixed with some mods, besides if you´re not a Graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ you´ll deal with it.\n\nAs i said above, this game has consciousness about his best points, sound and lighting, but we are not talking about screamers. We are talking about subtle Terror full of hues, as the good terror-touch should be. Just an example, during the game, youll heard the enemies claiming this response "We are part of the many" this "many" is the "Hive" created by the enemies to defeat the human beings in the ships, now they know (and WE know) that you are alone, and they try to delve into that fact to psychically destroy you.\n\n\nAs for the RPG, SS2 keeps a good Skill-System that allows you to perform a wide variety of actions during the game, this is possible with the "Cyber-modules" given as rewards for searching or completing objectives. But this is a good CRPG system so you wont be able to upgrade EVERYTHING. Here it is why:\n\n-First, it encourages you to replay the game. Every skill build will be different, each one will provide you something, and EVERYTHING can be a tool to achieve your goal, win the game.\n-Secondly, and the most remarkable. It adds difficulty to the game. Difficulty its not a way to qualify a game. But it helps to define it, here in SS2 you wont be able to restore your Cybermodules, they are limited, valuable and its use will reward you, so be mindful of your purpose.\n-Thirdly, motivation. Want to be the best Psico/Hacker/Soldier/etc..? Give your best. Dont expect to be the best being a passive-player, the more you risk the more you´ll achieve. Some room will have nanites (money) or another item that you need, and OF COURSE they´ll be enemies around, turrets or security robots, so break your mind, build up your tactic and try to overcome adversity in order to improve your character.\n\nApart from CRPG, Adventure and Horror the shooter part is so well oiled, i mean seriously you have an entire arsenal to use, every weapon has its own stats, effects and mechanics, so you can ALWAYS get another weapon, avoiding that bland part in every game when you only get 1 weapon for all things...Also the game includes a degradation and maintenance of the weapons and a variety of ammo.\n\n\nBack in the day this game was relevant, nice scores, many awards, positives reviews...But only the time bring System Shock 2 to the summit, it has a lot of followers, a Cult Follower, an active community of modders since 1999... I know that i left a lot of things in the inkwell, but this game is that sort of game that must be played, not read.","October 8, 2014","true","19.5"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","28","35","4","1"

The elderly graphics don't bother me too much, but then I am used to older games.\n\nThe story is fantastic and you can easily see where the developers incorporated the plot from this game into BioShock.\n\nSHODAN is easily one of the best video game villains of all all time.  Her voice is both terrifying and seductive and she gives me the absolute creeps.  The Many was no slouch, either.\n\nIt's not easy to find a scary game that disturbs me.  I've seen a lot of horror and I'm not easily freaked out by monsters, gore, or jump scares.  System Shock 2, however, provides a haunting experience that I highly recommend.\n\nThere are clunky aspects to the game, however, since the RPG stat-building elements are not well-balanced.  Some paths are far more viable than others, and the game practically begs you to take hacking as a skill.  Even so, it can be fun to make a strange build to provide a greater challenge.\n\nAnd speaking of challenge, I appreciated what I experienced in System Shock 2.  It's very easy to die in this game, and you need to be conservative if you rely on ammo to kill most enemies because they do respawn.  If you're careful and focus on melee during the early levels you can do well near the end game, but even when I did that the final areas took me a few tries to complete.  When compared to BioShock, which provides most of its challenge at the beginning of the game, this was very refreshing.\n\nIt's my favorite game on Steam for a reason!","October 11, 2014","true","47.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","0"

And I don't regret it. The comparisons between this and BioShock are pretty much spot on, but I must say that this game seems like a more complex version of BioShock; a great thing, in my opinion.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty varied, from the number of different weapons you can get, to the psionic abilities. The RPG aspects are pretty good as well, allowing you to customize your character according to your playstyle. The weapons get damaged over time, which means that you must perform maintenance on them periodically, otherwise they'll end up breaking (you can still repair them, though). The hacking mechanic is good, and the research function, which sometimes requires you to find the appropriate elements for your research is excellent.\n\nAs far as environments go, you can go almost anywhere. You can return to earlier sections of the ship to look for stuff you left there, and all the different decks have their unique style. There's a good variety of enemies, each with their own weaknesses and strength, which you can learn about by researching their organs after you kill them. It also has a good soundtrack, and the story, without spoilers, is excellent.\n\nI really recommend this game, especially if you enjoyed the original BioShock.","November 15, 2014","true","17.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","3"

Infact it's almost an EXACT CLONE of this game (and whats the first weapon? That's right kids, it's the wrench). You say "EVE", I say "PSI". You say upgrade stations? i say upgrade stations, aaaannd finally you say ADAM i say cyborg points. Fans will also notice a rather large "Dead Space" feel as well and to be honest, many think that Dead Space was in early development going to be System Shock 3... (if this is so, THANK YOU STAR INSURANCE! WE LOVE YOU FOR NOT LETTING THIS HAPPEN! *ahem*).\n\nThe graphics (to some) are low budget and a little to old, as well as the models (we shall ignore these people, they are fools). However saying this the lighting and levels themselves still manage to give it a dark, moody atmosphere walking round the cyberpunk infused science vessel "INNNNN SPAAAAAACE!" (and i deny ANYONE to say cyborg mid-wives have lost their freaky edge). Also, in true old-style FPS fasion, there are alot of keys to use to the untrained eye, however players soon realise they are not mandatory and to be honest are there only for other play styles from that era (believe it or not some players used to use keyboard ONLY on fps back then... I know can you believe that?).\n\nSo yes for new and old gamers BUY THIS, either on GOG or here. Doesn't matter, its worth it and if you dont like the graphics then there are literally 15 years worth of mods (many of which got updated due to it's re-release) and yes as its Night Dive the community did most of the work for them and as usual, used it :/ (you will notice this recuring pattern with them) so they could not F"$% this one up even if they tried to.\n\nAlso once again, thank you star insurance for making sure no one took this and "EA'ed" in all these years (fingers crossed this new one won't do this either... ).","April 23","true","1.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","18","20","3","0"

It combines complex, deep and challenging gameplay into one sweet result. The game feels overwhelming at first but once you get past the 2 or 3 hours mark you slowly start to understand how the game works. The game's complex level design makes exploring very satisfying, and very rewarding too. Audio logs contains usefull passwords and stuff, really easy to miss. So its really important to look everywhere before continuing on. Enemies spawn at random too, so you can come back to an earlier zone and there will still be hybrids roaming around. Kinda forces you to stay on your guard at all times.\n\nThe game features a pretty elaborate research system, too. If you pick up a strange item, you can research it and get damage bonus on certain enemies or even use the items as temporary upgrades on you. However there's a catch, you can't just research everything you want. You have to find special chemicals stored inside rooms in some levels. Not all levels share the same chemicals too, so you have to check in every room for the required chemicals. I thought that was pretty deep and well conceived. I thought there was too few items to reasearch too. theres maybe 10~ total.\n\n\nThe game features an evil AI called Shodan. Probably my favorite antagonist in any game ever. The developpers made sure to handle the characther with great care, every single of her quotes are all very memorable and devilishly creepy. The atmostphere in this game is perfect. Don't let the old graphics scare you away. The graphics adds a certain charm to the game, there is nothing quite like the atmosphere you can find in System Shock 2. I believe its atsmophere is what makes the game so special in its own way.\n\n\nHacking seems complicated at first, but it becomes pretty simple when you discover that you cant do anything about it and that your hacking stats does everything for you. Basicly, you just have to click the blue squares and hope something good happens! Its a good idea to upgrade every hacking skills though. The game actually requires you to hack something to make progress. So you cant run away from it.\n\n\nAll in all i think its a fantastic game and is worth everyone's attention. Its captivating gameplay and atmosphere is sure to make any hardcore rpg fans very satisfied!\n\n\n\n\n","July 19, 2014","true","28.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","4"

System Shock 2 arguably created a type of genre that has been and is still being mimicked/used to this day in the gaming market; and that genre is what I call the FPS/RPG survival hybrid; you see this ‘inventory and upgrade’ based system in many of today’s games for both survival and shooter style games alike.  System Shock 2, although somewhat antiquated for today’s standards was very groundbreaking for its time (this could be said about both SS1 and 2), but without saying more repetitive rhetoric that’s already been said I will get down to the pro/con list in this game that I think is appropriate:\n\nPros:\n-Groundbreaking FPS/RPG hybrid that works very well even to today’s standards.\n\n-Very immersive atmosphere (it really does feel like your there).\n\n-Fluid and extremely customizable and varied control scheme system (you can even save your control scheme setup!).\n\n-Varied options in terms of playstyle and choice of weaponry.\n\n-Various interesting choices and options that actually make you THINK in which a lot of modern games today even lack.\n\n-Small options and features that only add to the immersion such as weapon customization and maintenance, hacking games, inventory management perks and sub-perks, and a currency system for hacking and the purchasing of items via ‘value-rep/vending machines’ (you can even add markers on the mini map and name them as well as add markers in the level in real-time).\n\n-Occurrences in the game that were some of the first of their kind (‘meeting shodan’ for example).\n\n-A game engine that seems to have stood the test of time (with the recent (and even old) updates to the game it runs extremely fluid on pretty much all modern systems).\n\n-Fun and satisfying combat.\n\n-The game creates an overall feeling of fear and tension that was done well.\n\n-Interesting and diverse enemies to fight against.\n\n-Very high replay value.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the options available for upgrade/purchase can be redundant and useless (although every option does have its uses depending on playstyle and skill level of the player).\n\n-Some minor bugs/exploits.\n\n-cyber interface and control scheme can be somewhat complicated for new players.\n\nOverall I consider System Shock 2 to be one of my few personal all-time favorite games and I place it high on my list.  I feel that if you enjoy FPS games and like deep immersion you really should consider giving this game a try.\n\nMy rating breakdown:\n\n-.1 some redundant upgrade and weapon choices dependent somewhat upon playstyle\n\n-.1 minor bugs/exploits\n\n(10-.2 = 9.8)\n\nFinal rating of 9.8/10","October 3, 2015","true","23.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Rebind the keys, check out PC Gaming Wiki's modding guide to improve the archaic graphics, put on some headphones, stick it up on a good-sized monitor (something that takes up a lot of your field of view, ideally), get past the initial opening hump, and experience the game that inspired so many greats, from Bioshock to Portal, Dead Space to Fallout 3.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is the game that inspired a friend of mine to say "hey, you're right, Doc, it is better than Bioshock!" One of the highest-rated games of all time, but System Shock 2 outdoes it. It's a better horror game, a better adventure game, a better RPG, and an all-around better game than Bioshock. Its widespread influence on gaming is undeniable, and at least, if not more influential, than Half-Life.\n\nYeah, it's old, so it looks ugly and doesn't have the kind of animation quality you might find in a newer game. Yeah, the weapons degrade, and some people don't like that. Yeah, the key bindings are weird and awful. But it's great.

There are fewer, if any, better gaming narratives than this.

Their first project was to work with Looking Glass on a sequel to one of the most innovative FPS games of all time. The end result was of the most atmospheric, immersive, frightening and enjoyable games I've ever played.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is a thinking man's shooter, a complex RPG, a stealth game and a survival horror nightmare combined with an amazing story to tie it all together.\n\nThe game is set in the year 2114, 42 years after the events of the original game and, while it helps in a few places, you do not need to have played the first game in order to fully enjoy this one.\n\nYou start as a nameless soldier applying to enrol into the UNN. After 4 years of service in your chosen branch of the UNN military, you are called upon to join the crew of the Von Braun, which is about to take her maiden voyage into the furthest reaches of space. You wake up on-board, with no memory of the last few weeks, to find that the crew has been slaughtered by an unidentified force.\n\nIn System Shock 2, every single bullet is crucial to your survival as you explore the open-ended environments. You will also have to think about what ammo to use against what targets, maintaining, repairing and upgrading your weapons to keep them in good condition, hacking computers, replicators and security systems and upgrading your cybernetic gear to allow you to carry more items, run faster, hit harder, hack better and take more damage. You will not be able to purchase all upgrades or master everything so choosing wisely is essential.\n\nDon't expect to be guided by the hand however, you will have to find your own way around the ship. You can and will have to revisit previous areas of the ship and any items you have left there will still be there on your return journey. Don't expect cleared out areas to remain safe however, the game will keep you on your toes by re-spawning enemies making very few areas safe for long.\n\nTalking about environments, this isn't a dark, miserable, flickery lighting infested place. This is a place where people had to live; you'll not only visit warehouses, docking areas, loading bays and shuttle bay areas but also living quarters and recreational areas, a casino, movie theatre and even a botanical garden!  There are some other amazing places too but well.. where's the fun in me telling you everything? ;)\n\nAs for the story, its told in a way similar to that of the original game; you'll find audio logs around the ship made by the crew. From every day chores they had, love interests, moaning about co-workers to what is happening to them as they're recording, the logs give you a picture of what happened to them and may even help you find things hidden around the ship for your own survival.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is built on the same technology Thief uses, known at the Dark Engine. Because of this, the advanced character controlling and stealth mechanisms are carried over to Shock 2. You can hide in the shadows and observe enemies and their behaviour. Enemies can hear you and can be distracted by noise, they'll search the area if suspicious of your presence and will alert their allies if you are seen or manage to escape from them after a fight doesn't go as planned.\n\nFor all its amazing points, the game does have some faults; some of the RPG skill branches don't make much sense, the level design at times feels rushed. The character models, even for the time, were incredibly ugly and whilst the game's story ends on a high note, the ending is a massive 'To be continued...' bombshell that may never get fully answered.\n\nThis is the pinnacle of 90's PC Gaming. Games like Deus Ex and BioShock would never have been made without this and games like Borderlands, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Dishonored, Mass Effect and Dead Space all went on to borrow elements from this one game.\n\nAbsolutely 100% recommended!","May 10, 2013","true","67.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I started with the vanilla version but I spent most of the time with a modded version (community patch, various texture and graphical mods). So my experience is mostly based on a patched up SyS 2.\nAs many others, I knew Bioshock before I've heard of SyS 2. I was aware that Bioshock was heavily influenced by Sys 2, the one can be seen as the spiritual successor or the other way round SyS 2 as the predecessor.\nSome say that SyS 2 is the better game and I was sceptical about that because of the game's age and Bioshock's quality. Well, it's a matter of taste and I won't debate it here.\n(Let's finally start with the review at this point.) However what SyS 2 delivers is downright beautiful. I actually turned the new NPC models (mod) off because the original ones with high poly scare the pie out of me.\nThis refers to my first point: -Atmosphere- The setting presented is executed in a brilliant way. Music (ambient one, not the DnB/Techno - at least for my taste) and surrounding are intertwined beautifully. Additionaly the mechanics and gameplay add to the hostile feeling and environment because you're constantly short on supplies. You are worried about every next step. This again meets with the urge to explore. The game does it right, because not only you want to explore, you also have to because of the supply shortage. And you don't feel forced to as well as you will get rewarded for your curiosity without making the game predictable.\nI forgot to mention the customization which goes far deeper than in e.g. Bioshock. Your character can be developed in innumerous ways - not only in terms of common classes. In sum classes and specialization are very "fluid". Everything makes sense in-game - it isn't just there, so you can do it but it's thought through. The way this game makes you making choices is just hard to be matched.\n-Realism- Some people classify this game as a "sim fpsrpg" and that for a reason. E.g. every weapon wears off. You can maintain, repair and modify objects. Certain weapons work on certain enemies etc. You have to know and can research your enemies weaknesses. It boils down to stats eventually but also on how you approach every single situation. Gunplay (if focused by your way of playing) itself isn't very satisfying but it serves its purpose.\n-AI- Well the AI has aged but it has implemented the stages of awareness you might know of the Thief titles - being suspicious, alerted, etc. It may be clunky but pathfinding works good and it strangely fits the game. It is bone-hard to beat anyway, and the AI makes it even scarier.\n\nSome final words: Of course the game has faced enough criticism as well for being clunky and overly complex but I guess the community patches have brought some extra balance and smoothed out the rough edges (graphically and figuratevly speaking). And the mod manager let's you turn mods on and off (!) in a matter of seconds which is a big advantage compared to dumb copy and paste of modded directories. Simply put, the (modding) community is great - also thanks to Looking Glass Studios.\nAd Backtracking criticism: I don't consider this as a problem. As aforementioned - it makes sense and is part of the realism. Furthermore it adds to reduce linearity so often seen in games and it rewards players who can memorise stuff.\nFinal words: SyS 2 reminds you of what a game can be and what a game can and should do right. I recommend it to everyone and plead for some patience of those who feel e.g. overwhelmed at first.\n\nYours,\nB.","July 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Scary at some points. Something about monsterus humans screaming about how you should run because they don't have control of their bodies gives me the creeps.\n\nThe game is an old deus ex like shooter. It has all the fun stuff like save scumming and an overly complex character customization system. I mean there are like 7 systems in place at the same time to consider when upgrading your character. Psy stuff, stat points, weapon proficiency, etc. All different categories. On top of that there’s weapon durability to consider, (weapons jam and have to be hacked or repaired in a different way when warn down) type of armour that’s best for a situation to consider and the whatever-they’re-called things that give passive bonuses but run out of rechargeable energy things to equip. There’s a whole lot of complicated systems at play in this game. SS2 comes from an era before game systems were dumbed-down for players.\n\nEnemies respawn but supplies don’t meaning that you’re always sort of on a clock until you’re screwed with no ammo. At some points there are ‘hallways of death’ that are over-tuned and spawn too many enemies every time you have to pass through them. The game encourages specializing in one weapon type but is sparse with ammo suggesting the use of multiple weapons be the best course of action.\n\nIn the early part of the game character logs that play back audio are great. Latter on in the game enemies are way more powerful and there’s not really a moment of downtime to listen to them. They stack up. This isn’t a big deal.\n\nThe whole psy stuff is cumbersome. Basically the game has a system of using things similar to dues ex augments. Stuff like ‘use this much energy to get a 2 minute long damage reduction shield.’ It’s hard to specialize in psy weapon stuff when you don’t know ahead of time if you’ll ever even use half the abilities they provide. Changing abilities in battle is also hazardous.\n\nThe game has a great pace. The game introduces new enemies one at a time. It builds up to the moment and the enemies are really hard when first encountered. Then as time goes on and the player becomes more powerful and new enemies are introduced the old enemies become easy to deal with. This is fun and makes you feel powerful despite your power increase coinciding with the increase of power of enemies.\n\nThe game can’t be stealth’d. This is no dues ex. If an enemy is close they know where you are.\n\nThe game has a fun twist where you were being directed by the evil AI the entire time. Going-in to the game, basically reading any sort of thing such as the description of the game you’d know ahead of time this was going to happen so this isn’t a spoiler. The thing is: since you know it’ll happen you sort of just wait for it and it’s a bit of a let down.\n\nFor some reason the main character can just sort of see ghost custseans every so often. The game explains it with some techno mumbo jumbo. It’s as if the game devs wanted to put everything into the game including the kitchen sink. They really packed the game with stuff that seems unnecessary. Remember before when I mentioned the 7 systems at play at once. Same sort of thing here. There’s no need for randomly 5 or so ghost events to happen for no reason.\n\nThe game sort of has a pothole where the AI you’re working with takes over all the ship’s systems but security cameras and bots and stuff are still against you. Wtf? By the way the entire game, well most of it is on a super massive space ship. It even has a shopping mall. It feels like a ship that can support having a shopping mall in it. It’s just that big. There’s a bit of backtracking in the game. It’s fun to go back to old areas. The first wing of the game is basically getting access to 5 main floors of the ship. It feels like a cohesive world when all floors are accessible. Then the game’s like whops there’s a new elevator and now the game is a more linier path forward until the end. Then eventually the player gets to a point of no-going-back and it feels bad to never revisit all the areas cleared of alien infection. BTW there’s an alien parasite sort of thing and that’s why everyone’s dead. The AI you work with made it in SS1.\n\nAnyways. Good game over-all. The very end’s trippy. The final cutsean of the game’s hilarious. No spoilers.","May 8","true","25.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

Setting the flag for the survival horror schifi rpg genre, SS2 is a game lots will enjoy, and few can handle without any help from walkthroughs and maybe cheats as well.\n\nFind yourself alone in a ship far away into the dead space in the middle of a chaotic hostile and evil environment. Choose your skills well. Your moves even better. Trust the machine. Scavenge. Hack. Kill. Survive.\n\nThe game is scary, creepy, spooky (insert more synonyms here) and good god it's so hard.

Perfect voice acting. Voice audiologs way so perfect for its time. Perfect script and story. Good graphics for its time. No major bugs. You can install mods. Environent design and scary elements that makes this game the Dead Space of 1999....on crack. Replayable due to class selection and different way to handle the fightsystem (if you got enough pills with you)\n\nCONSLots of backtracking. Difficult game to beat.\n\nFan of the genre?

You fight monsters that are transforming out of human.\nThe story is simple but nice and has some surprises.\n\nThe best of the game is the atmosphere for me! The most I liked is the cool voice editing I guess. Regulary you hear some voices in your head and these are edited quite good. The creepiness comes along with scary monsters and creepy voices. The monsters respawn randomly so you actually can never cool down. Additionally, you are alone all over.\n\nThe RPG part consists of a skill system. So you can hack consolses and more but you have to have the knowledge for example.\nMoreover, there's a research system and for some objects you have to find chemicals. I really like that idea.\n\nAltough System Shock 2 is from 1999 it's great. It's a classic game. I really like old games. You too?

It's over a decade old and you've got these people yammering on about how good it is, and now you might be wondering if you should bother with it or not.\n\nThis is the first time I've played this game and I have to say that there is some excellence to be found here and some annoyances, just like in any good game.\n\nThis is an FPS with RPG elements, with heavy emphasis on RPG. You'll want to research a bit about character creation before you start, or you could just have a go at it, if you don't mind maybe having to restart half way through.\n\nThe sound design in this game is what really makes it for me. I turned the music off as soon as I started. The atmospheric sounds really hit the spot. I played with 2.1 speakers (that's two speakers and a sub) and it really worked that sub. The character logs in the game are fully voiced. You can also replay the logs and you will probably have to because sometimes you'll be walking along, listening to a log and a scripted log will come up, playing the two simultaneously, which was kind of annoying.\n\nYou'll want to reconfigure the controls for a more modern set up. WSAD and all that good stuff. The game feels pretty natural after you get set up.\n\nThe gameplay, coupled with the forboding machinery and sound effects, is really tense. I found myself making extensive use of the leaning keys (Q and E) in order to peek around corners to see if I could get the drop on an enemy before they got one over on me.\n\nThe story, while not a direct sequel, does borrow heavily from System Shock 1. Having never played the first in the series, the story still works for me because they fill you in on the basics in the intro.\n\nThe level design is, for the most part, pretty good. I didn't have to wonder or wander too much in order to figure out where I was supposed to be and exploration was rewarding. Things start getting a little weird near the end and I have to say that, while at first, I felt the game was stretching out a bit for time, it ended up making me feel like the last two or three hours were a necessary trial. BTW, there's no waypoint markers, in case you were wondering, but then what's the point of exploring if you've always got an arrrow telling you where to go??\n\nSo, if you can deal with reconfiguring controls, dated graphics (there's a few texture resizing mods that are good), some old fashioned exploration without waypoints, and the last few hours feeling a little like a hail mary denouement, it is pretty good.\n\nI don't have the rose-tinted glasses to tell you that it's a cornerstone of PC gaming or that everyone who has business calling themselves a gamer should have played it, but I would say that I might actually play it again someday and that's not something I say often.","June 13, 2014","true","15.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game is one of the greatest computer games I have ever played. From the creators of Thief, and it’s just as good. Anyway, let’s get into this.\nDISCLAIMER: This review will include some forms of spoilers\n\nGameplay- The gameplay is very nice; very easy to get into. Admittingly the two different forms of HUD were a little funky at first, but I quickly got use to it, and I enjoyed running in one direction away from Hybrids while trying to reload my gun with a different set of bullets. The “Cyber Modules” system was also good. Using Cyber Modules you can upgrade the player’s Stats, Weapons Skills, Psi Powers, and Tech. At the start of the game it’s easy to get into upgrading your character with the different Cyber Modules you are given or pick up throughout the Von Braun, and then as the game goes on Upgrades start costing more and more Cyber Modules to the point where each Cyber Module you receive is like the greatest thing ever, and that my friends, is how you do a Upgrade system. I never actually got into the Psi Powers, so I can’t say much on that, but of what I did it was pretty cool and snazzy.\n\nGraphics- The game was made in 1999 for Computers… So that should say something about the graphics. But the graphics aren’t horrid, they’re easy to look at, but it actually took the “Horror” aspect of the game down a bit because of how laughable some of the enemies look. There are some mods are textures you can download however to increase the quality of the textures, and those do look good so I would recommend them.\n\nSetting- As I mentioned above, the game is “Horror”. However, it is much more than just a Horror game(and as I mentioned before the graphics make it not all that scary). In the first few parts of the game you’ll come across the occasional severed limb or head. But as the game goes on they start appearing less and less until they’re just gone for good almost. In my opinion that shows that the developers weren’t trying to make a full out Horror game (of the Hollywood variety anyway). There are also a couple dead bodies hanging from the ceiling with horrific face expressions, but I only find like three of those. The main enemies in the game are Hybrids, which look like humans with a worm coming out of their chest biting onto their head, but really, it’s not all that scary. Now that I’ve covered the Horror parts of the game, it’s time to talk about how the game isn’t actually a “Horror” game. As I said before there is so much more to the game. It is definitely a Suspense game, and that it does perfectly. The game depends on the mysteries and suspense to creep you out rather than gore, which is great for the game. There are also the many Audio-logs left by the dead crew members. Many of these Logs help flesh out the history of the ship and it’s inhabitants, and all that happens before the start of the game. Some of the Logs you’ll wish you never read… Ehehehehe\n*Spoilerriffic stuffs start here*\nSHODAN is also a very important point of the game. Starting from her reveal up to the end of the game the game is at it’s best, with her constantly talking to you and prodding you along in her distorted yet adorable(I kid) voice. SHODAN’s interactions with the player are some of the best parts of the game: “I AM SHODAN”, “I-I-Insect!”, “Can’t you do anything right?!”\nI was actually pretty disappointed when she betrayed me, I thought me and her had something, D:\n*End*\nVERDICT- This game is great, but probably not for everyone. If you are a fan of darker games or just want to play a game that’ll scare you(DARN ROBOTS!) but not give you nightmares, play this. Also I recommend this to fans of the “Thief” series, as it is made by the same studio and shares many voices(Stephen Russel, FTW!). This game took “Sci-Fi Horror” and made something great. I would really like to see a third game someday… *looks off into the sunset*\nAnyway, 8.5/10!

It was probably sometime when I was looking up Bioshock, itching to find out about its story and symbolism. It was free on most abandonware websites, so naturally I decided to get it and try it out. It was probably one of the first horror games I'd played that legitimately instilled a feeling of unease with me. The design of the levels, music, and sound design made for a truly immersive game, despite the limited graphics of its time.\n\nAnd then I played System Shock 2. Bar nun one of my favorite games of all time, it managed to take what the original had and raise the bar to a level of quality that to this day has yet to be reached. While complex and bogged down by the limitations of its time, System Shock 2 manages to work around or even with them to create an experience that is so indescribably harrowing and deeply disturbing, so shocking and haunting, that to say it legitimately scared me, that it actually made me panic, would be an understatement.\n\ntl;dr ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants 11/10","August 14, 2014","true","25.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Great techno music during combat, great writing and a fun and creepy story.\nIt's still an amazing game i just think that most gamers are spoiled with the hand holding in modern games and they will never be able to get into this kind of game and experience it which is sad. You have to figure out what you have to do and where you have to go by yourself. There is no magic waypoint all the time telling you where you need to go. You have to read logs to find codes for doors to progress and research specific items needed to progress using different chemicals that you have to find in the levels. You have to carefully manage your inventory and supplies throughout the whole game or you won't be able to progress. The game forces you to use your brain and you get a great sense of accomplishment when you complete a stage you have been on for hours (engineering).\nThis game also rewards you very nicely for exploring every area of the game with items which encourages taking your time and exploring every area of the ship. This game has some of the best sound design of all time with the voice of shodan and the sounds of the ship and the music and sound effects etc. It's still honestly one of the best games ever made i would put it somewhere in my top 20 i can't really think of anything i dislike about it.\n10/10 (Masterpiece)","April 21","true","12.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A very diverse gameplay style and unique quality which many games of the new mdoern generation fail to have. An art style that feels like Deus Ex. This game feels like the blueprint for future first person action games to come. It's also a horror game. This game is filled with Scares which will make you wanna wet yourself, but also do it in such a good way that makes it such an immersive experience.

It works like a charm @ 2048x1152\n\nThe game mechanics where far beyond it's time, that's why after 15 years SS2 stills holds up pretty well.\nIf you don't mind the dated graphics (and you shouldn't moederneuker!), play this game! seriously, buy it as soon as it's in the steamsales @75% discount!\n\n\nIn my 20+ years of gaming this game most def. ends up in my top 10 pc games.\n","July 2, 2014","true","39.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The atmosphere, the story, the difficulty... all of it culminates together to create an experience that makes you afraid to get into combat, the enemy is truly dangerous, and you feel small compared to the power the enemy wields. I will never put this game down for good.\n\nOkay, now that the worship is over.\n\nThe Controls\nThis game came out in 1999, 15 years ago. That being said, the default controls are a little out-of-date, but once you change them to a more modern FPS format (A and D strafe instead of turn, maybe use R for interaction because the lean on Q and E are very useful), it is much more comfortable. Mantling is something I had never seen before in a game, and it's popular now, but this is the first game I had ever seen it in. (long time a go folks!)\n\nThe Story\nWho doesn't want to find out what is going on? Everything has gone to hell and you are confused, alone, and know nothing. The perfect place to start. Even as you progress, the elements of the story are told from the perspectives of so many others,  creating a world much like a book would. Story after story unfolds before you, each one telling a small piece of what is happening to you. You never quite have all the pieces, and the mystery grows and grows until the end...\n\nThe RPG Elements\nEveryone likes RPG Elements in good games like this. Getting to make your own choices, living with those choices, and adapting to them is what an RPG is about. Each choice you make feels significant, and as the game progresses, you succeed or fail by the decisions you make.\n\nThe Difficulty\nI would have to say that the game is incredibly difficult if you are unprepared. The game forces you to play smart, to look around corners, to conserve your resources whenever possible, to take your time... This is a good thing, because it gives the game a feeling that you are always in danger, and without the difficulty it wouldn't be as frightening. This is an aspect of games that has been lost over the years... and now many games, even on the most difficult setting, is not too difficult. I've yet to try and beat this beast on Impossible... Kudos to any masters who have done it.\n\nThe Graphics\nThe Graphics are from 1999. The textures are ancient. Yes. We know this. Go Download SHTUP and follow the instructions to update your textures if it's that big a deal. For the time, they were pretty darn good.\n\nJUST BUY IT\nYOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED","August 9, 2014","true","31.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Often considered ahead of its time, System Shock 2 is a great FPS/RPG with a great horror/sci-fi setting, and is one of the few survival horror games that gives an actual sense of survival with very limited ammunition and healing supplies.  It set the bar for story telling and atmosphere in a way that few games since have matched.  If it can be said to have any flaw, it would be its dated graphics, but even those aged fairly well when compared to other games of the time.

I played on hard difficulty with constant quicksaves, finished the game with more than 1500 nanites (the currency in this game) and over 40 med hypo.\n\nYou can play the game anyway you want with numerous different builds you can try. You can be an all melee character, a psi warrior or a boring soldier wielding common standard guns. Always remember that the wrench is you friend, and it is year 2114 - not knowing some hacking is almost the same as being illiterate.\n\nThe enemy AI is in consistent. Sometimes they see you, sometimes they don't (maybe because I was in the shadow?).

Giving the player choices of which particular skills to require before the game-proper actually begins, does indeed give one the feeling that you are forming the player character out of your own choices and decisions and this further increases one's emotional involvement.\n\nAs you slowly begin to explore the craft and pick up clues as to what has caused such havoc, the tension is palpable. From emails and voice recordings which you discover as you journey onwards, a sense of an actual place which was once full of living, breathing humans definitely starts to take shape. In addition to these manifold good points, the graphics themselves still look great even 15 years after the game was made.\n\nHowever, there are more than a few droplets of vinegar mixed in with the Ambrosial honey.\n\nPrimarily, the main drawback, or perhaps a kinder word might be ;challenge', to System Shock 2 is the often bewildering complexity of elements at your player-characters disposal. In order to make intelligent progress, akin to how one might actually behave in such a real-life situation itself, the player has to juggle a veritable myriad of game-world stimuli. Emails, personal data assistants, logs on computers, notes and letters found on bodies, a constant stream of voice-messages in your character's earpiece, and much more of the detritus of exploring the seemingly dead spaceship, constantly seems to bombard the player until at times one can feel at a loss as to what to take note of and what to ignore. Perhaps this can be seen as part of the character's real-life predicament, but if the designers had taken the trouble to give more structure and order to the bombardment of information thrown at the player throughout it could have led to a less confusing and more enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe I'm just a bit slow at times, or too methodical and tidy in my own personal way of dealing with tasks so I do hold my hand up and offer that as an explanation to the above constructive criticism.\n\nEven so, I have heard from several other sources of note, such as some seasoned gamers and highly respected gaming press, that System Shock 2 involved far too much traipsing back and forward through similar-looking corridors in search of a vital key or door-code or something of the like, without which further progress was not possible. Yet, for the gamer, completing these tasks became distinctly arduous, often extremely monotonous and frankly, unpleasantly exhausting. Elongating the play-time of a game in such a manner is frowned upon these days and for good reason.\n\nHowever, these constructive criticisms are as nothing compared to the monumental depth, complexity, tension and intrigue of this computer game behemoth, which also includes one of the most legendary and infamous end-of-game bosses in the annals of video-gaming.\n\nTo play this game is not just to steep oneself in an immersive, tense and believablely frightening world, but it is to experience a piece of computer-gaming history.","December 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's not even very dark most of the time, most of the horror is psychological and is driven by you doing your best to survive.\n\nI feel that from a gameplay perspective, this vastly outshines Bioshock, or at least Bioshock Infitite. Well worth a try if you enjoyed the Bioshock series and are disappointed by the continual dumbing-down of its gameplay, or if you enjoyed Deus Ex, as it is very similar in terms of being a hybrid of tetris-inventory RPG and FPS gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are definitely where the game has not stood up the test of time, as even when it came out in 1999 it didn't look very good. However, there are mods such as SHTUP and Rebirth that improve the model and texture quality, the models being the most lacking back in the day.\n\nIn short: worth a try. It is perfectly compatible with modern systems, thanks to the recent NewDark patch, and is definitely worth it to see how much Bioshock Infinite has thrown away the series formula. And if you thought GLaDOS was the universe's scariest evil AI, you're in for a surprise.","April 16, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's audio log system adds so much to the atmosphere, and while not every audio log is required to advance the game, the extra logs add so much ambiance and story.  This reminds me of a time when it wasn't only graphics that were important, but telling a good story, sucking the players into the game.\n\nGame installed perfectly and ran perfectly on my Windows 7 system, something that blew my mind, because I remember trying to jimmy this game into working on older OS's, but newer than what it was designed for, and it was a huge pain in the rear-end.\n\nThere is really no reason not to purchase, install, and play the hell out of this game...  unless graphics are the only reason you play games.

The gameplay, while a mesh of three different genres, does it very well. Combat works well, and is satisfying. Movement is a bit wonky, but it's easy enough to get used to. I love the character building element, meaning a different experience depending on what you choose to upgrade, both early and later in the game.\nThe story is great, as well as the atmosphere. Listening to the audio logs to fill in the story, all relies on you, and it really sucks you into the game. I love how you can explore the whole ship, and it IS a ship, complete with everything you expect a ship to contain, including bathrooms (minor detail, but again helps the immersion). After a while, you really begin to dread most things, especially once you slowly realize just how alone you are on this ship full of monsters, killer cyborgs, and murderous AI's.\nWhile the game looks old now, being it's been 15 years, you can easily mod the game using the new engine (included with the Steam release), as well as other aspects. The music, amazing, though a tad out of place in my opinion (only the hyper-techno sections, the normal "horror" segments are great for the feel). While it didn't "scare" me as much as I had hoped, I still got a little spooked just at the story alone, as well as some of the enemies (Cyborg Midwives, holy crap). As I said, atmosphere is king, and you do well to allow yourself to get "sucked in" to the game.\nOverall, a great release; and after playing it from a modern standpoint, I still think it holds up well today. I believe now when people say it's one of the most "innovative" FPS games in the last 20 years, as well as it's overall quality. Worth a shot, definitely now that it's available to everyone on modern machines thanks to Steam.","January 11, 2014","true","23.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Apart from having the standard arsenal of fps weapons, you get to use psi powers ("magic abilities"), such as shooting energy bolts or pulling objects to you. Though the main appeal of the game is its story. Dark and enthralling, System Shock evokes feelings of utterly loneliness on a space ship were everyone has died or turned cyborg. Immersion is deepened by recordings that can be found throughout the ship, and makes the player curious to find out what exactly happened.\n\nThe bad: The game came out in 1999, and its age is showing. The graphics are blurry and outdated, and combat is clunky, so don't expect anything state of the art. I personally wasn't too bothered by the outdated graphics, as it lends it a nostalgic feeling. Though there are mods that enhance the graphics, such as hi res textures and new gun and enemy models.\n\nThe verdict: An absolute classic when it comes to PC gaming, and still very much playable today. Top notch story, combat and freedom to create ones own character. Many of its features can be found in Levine's other fantastic game, Bioshock. Dystopian topic, immersive story through sound recordings, plasmids instead of psi powers and a mini crafting system. Without this, games such as Deus Ex would have never existed.","December 28, 2013","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Does these names ring any bells? Gaming tvrtka Looking Glass zadužena za sve ove naslove okupivši par u to doba amaterskih programera koji su radili side projects na ovim igrama je izdala pod svojim bannerom System Shock 2.\n\nKako ocijenit igru koja je izašla 1999 godine u 2014toj? Nemoguća misija?! Varate se, kultni naslov nikad ne gubi svoju čar. Iako sam sam igrao igru malo nakon što je u orginalu izašla (konfiguracija mi je bila p4,1GB RAM,Voodoo Graphics) sad nakon 15 godina imam isti osjećaj. Thank you STEAM na playable verziji igre! Pa pogledajte samo review ove igre prije 15 godina, sve te silne nagrade, jednostavno naslov je masterpiece! Od kraja do početka, jedna od rijetkih koja ima što se kaže u našem žanru "dušu". Koncept, ideja, storyline, atmosfera. Nimalo zahtjevna a ako volite ovaj žanr (Cyperpunk, Sci-Fi, RPG, Horror) i dalje igriva i držat će vas za tastaturom.\nUkratko o System Shock-u:\nIgra se odvija na zvjezdanom brodu u 2114 godini. Igrač preuzima ulogu usamljenog vojnika koji pokušava zaustaviti epidemiju genetske zaraze koja je poharala brod. Gameplay se sastoji od igre u prvom licu i istraživanja. Također uključuje elemente sistemskih razvijanja jedinstvenih vještina i osobina, kao što su hacking i psionic sposobnosti. Sama igra uključuje elemente RPGa te ima odličnu horor atmosferu.\nMožda novije generacije neće htjeti i neće imati želje da se vrate ka ovom starom naslovu ali ja kao već sad "old-gamer" itekako želim.\nNemojte zaboravit da iza ovog naslova stoji Ken Levine "mastermind" koji je osmislio i ostvario multi milionski projekat, igru "Bioshock" nasljednika, te kroz nju progurao sve elemente gameinga zastupljenog u System Shocku. Čak je u više navrata rekao da je System Shock sa svojim uspjesima i razvojem te načinom igre bio orginalno prethodnik Bioshock-a.\n\n\nhttp://theigraison.wordpress.com/","June 10, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Amazing story with astounding amounts of lore? Check. First person shooter? Check. RPG Elements that aren't overpowered by gunfire? Check. Incredibly scary atmosphere that could make the most strong minded powerful man curl up into a ball and cry? Check. Enemies that act as more than just bullet sponges? Check.\n\nThe graphics are dated, but really, for 1999, the graphics themselves were far ahead of their time. It shouldn't be a problem, because the gameplay is the best you'll find anywhere. I could pick my brain trying to find a flaw in this game, but it's just so...perfect.\n\nThe atmosphere. Alone on a spaceship. No one to help you but yourself. Infected crew members. Just...agghhh. The atmosphere is terrifying no matter who you are. It screws with your head on so many different levels, and then, after it reaches the top level of screwing with your head, it keeps tormenting you. The fear flows throughout your whole body and you'll have insane knee-jerk movements and will jump at ANYTHING if you're playing this - whether it be in the game or in real life. This game will scare you in ways you've never been scared before.\n\nThe FPS aspects are also more than just "Kill, complete objective, kill." The weapons can become damaged and ammo is scarce, so hoard that stuff like you're trying to get on a bad reality TV show. The RPG elements aren't just there to look pretty, either. They WILL affect your gameplay and you need to do more than just "oh, I'll allocate the cyber modules to this skill because the place to do that is right here next to me." You need to plan out what you improve on and put a lot of thought into it. Cyber Modules, like ammo, are scarce, and if you waste any you're S.O.L.\n\nThis game is much more psychological, in case you couldn't tell. It's scary, but it scares you in ways that don't need a lot of violence or blood or anything like that - the fear you feel is genuine fear. It also makes you put thought into the most trivial things and the game can get impossible if you ♥♥♥♥ up too many times with your judgement. First playthrough, I didn't get a single point in my research skill until I *had* to to continue the game, and even after that, I neglected the invaluable skill that I'd find to be a necessity for the survival of all classes. What happened?\n\nI didn't research things, naturally. I didn't know that'd come back to bite me in the ♥♥♥ so hard, but it did, and the game got INSANELY difficult because I went the wrong way with my cyber modules. I actually had to backtrack and dig in every nook and cranny in the spaceship to get some to up my research skill, but I was lucky that I found enough to up it to a barely adequate level.\n\nPoint in me telling this? If you make poor judgement calls, the game doesn't give you a break.\n\nHmmm...there's pretty much something for everyone in this game. The only type of person I *wouldn't* rec this game to is someone who doesn't like horror at all, because this game is scary as *♥♥♥♥.* Other than that, buy it. It'd be the best 10 dollars you've ever spent.\n","August 30, 2014","true","32.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There is something called "fan missions", fan missions are levels that you could download off of websites, fan missions are my favorite part about system shock 2 because you could create your own custom levels and the fan missions you could get are VERY fun!

SHODAN, the music, the creepiness, the level design, the futuristic science fiction theme and the amazing story..I love this game with all of my heart, I could never get tired of playing it or getting spooked by it. One of my top favorite PC games of all time. SHODAN will always be my favorite "villian" and I love her voice and the effects they put on it. The soundtrack suits the atmosphere so well and it's so different. The gameplay is fast paced and exciting and you're always anticipating something to jump out at you.

I was pretty much, hoping for the author to pop out all of the sudden and say "I plan to update this game completly, everyone who bought System Shock 2 Will get a free copy of the new updated game System Shock 3 :)" But that didn't happen, Oh well, at least we have you system shock 2. The game itself is good, if you know what to do and how to do it, if you don't know what to do or where to go, then you might as well be trying to eat pie without your mouth. I really enjoy it, and i was suprised on how good the game was considering the fact it was made, a while back, not only that but i was also suprised on how smoothly it ran throught the whole time i was playing, perhaps it got scared of the old graphics. I would recommend this game to the people that are open minded when it comes to old games, don't mind playing old video games, and people who like scare's now and then. Would not recommend to people whom Dislike horror games, outdated graphics and plots, ect ect. Other than that I would rate 11/10 Cats.","August 23, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has plot twists that sucker punch you like The Sixth Sense, and depth that challenges your mind like Inception.  The atmosphere alone is enough to make you feel a sense of fear and dread while playing.  Be warned though, if you're idea of a great game is the latest eye-candy-scripted-shooter you can play through in 10-12 hours, you may miss the point and experience of SS2.  You actually have to read and think to fully experience the game ;-)  In case you spring for it, here are a couple of links to help you get the most out of your first experience:\n\nSS2 Modding\nSS2 Newbie Guide[www.shtupmod.net]\nTTLG SS2/Thief Fan Site[www.ttlg.com]\n\nI highly suggest loading all the mods in the steam forum post, as they will improve the graphics significantly.

The game takes place on the worlds first star ship "The Van Braun", unfortunately, the ship has been taken over by an hybrid force known as "The Many", you would then have to explore and do certain task to reach your main objective.\nThe level design is great the graphics are not great but you could download mods to optimize your graphics. There is something called "fan missions", fan missions are levels that you could download off of websites, fan missions are my favorite part about system shock 2 because you could create your own custom levels and the fan missions you could get are VERY fun! The soundtrack for the game is one of the best that I have ever heard, some songs are creepy, some are awesome, but sometimes they will start creepy and then they would sound kick a♥♥. The gameplay is slow paste at first, but the more you level up, it will start to become a bit more fast paste and at some points chaotic. There is multiplayer, but you would need to download a program in order to play with your friends.\n\nThe story and chrectors are well written, the AI could be stupid at some points but its usually not a problem for this game.\n\nI give this game a 8/10","February 6","true","95.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In simple terms you can say that it's similar to its contemporary Deus Ex or its successor Bioshock, but I'd say that it's an experience entirely of its own. The main reason for this is that it's gosh dang scary. The logs and character writing give the creepiness depth, but I can't give enough credit to how much atmosphere the game derives from enemies and graphics that by today's standards shouldn't be enough for much more than a jump scare. Instead, even when the hybrids become easy to kill (one of the few flaws is the lack of enemy variety), their appearance and quavering sounds as they approach get me paranoid every time. The player progression is also far deeper than that of the Bioshock games even if it lacks the same in-universe hook to its upgrade system that Bioshock had in the Little Sisters. Overall, System Shock 2 holds up incredibly well as a game that makes being deeper than Bioshock and scarier than Dead Space seem completely effortless. 9/10\n\non second thought the hacking in this game doesnt have those BS pipes so 10/10","April 26","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having loved Bioshock 1 and 2 equally and the love I have for the dead space franchise (even though it's annoyingly console oriented), I thought "eh it's only like £1 on ♥♥♥". The major dissapointment of Bioshock: Infinite, granted I only played on it on console, made me want to explore the roots of two of my favorite games. I did research into Irrational Games throughout the late 90's and thinking of those programmers, sound engineers and art designers crammed into a tiny room creating this gave me a whole new appreciation for video game creation.\n\nSo on starting the game, I found all the different elements confusing at first (as with a lot of games), but immediately started noticing the similarities between bioshock and SS2:\n- PSI = EVE\n- Cybernetic Modules = ADAM\n- Security Codes\n- Wrench\n- and much more.\nGiven that this game was created barely a year after I was born, it has aged phenominally well and feels like a modern AAA title just with worse graphics. Also SHODAN is now my favorite villian of all time, maniny due to the creepy apperance and voice(s). The Many is also a VERY creepy villian and ALMOST tops SHODAN and how I noticed the similarities between The Many and The Corruption.\n\nI didn't feel as if playing the first game was nessasary and I think even after playing this I would find it just too dated. I didn't however, use any additional mods or graphical enhancements and played on easy because I'm bad :P. I can't wait to play the user created levels and maybe even the multiplayer if people still play it.\n\nSo in summary, this game is near perfect and DO NOT EVEN HESITATE to buy it, seriously. The Many flesh levels and the rather underwhelming boss fight were the ONLY bad things (I actually liked the ending, made me chuckle). And then we have news that System Shock 3 in development and Terri Brosius is again voicing SHODAN which is the best news ever. I feel as if this game was made for me, as do so many others. I'm really into Drum and Bass and it was very popular in the late 90's early 2000's, hence why this game is full of it.\n-----\n98/100 - a.k.a BUY IT","May 15","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I replay it every couple of years.\n\nHere I sit, having just completed my first (and last) playthrough on Impossible difficulty.\n\nAll things considered, some tips from a veteran:\n\n-Every class starts with level one Standard Weapons, so you might as well go for that assault rifle by maxing out Standard Weapons ASAP.\n-Don't bother with powered armor. It's not worth the shortfall between charge stations. Get enough for Medium Armor and move along.\n-Save at least three ICE-PICKS for the very end of the game. Trust me.\n-Scavenge jammed shotguns off Shotgun Hybrids. Yes, they are useless, but they always have at least one round in the chamber.\n-Go Navy. They master in two categories straight out the gate.\n-Enemies aimbot. They don't shoot where you WERE, they shoot where you are GOING TO BE. Go into every encounter able to put down a baddy before it can fire, or be prepared to run.\n-You only need just enough to Repair your weapons, not modify or maintain them, until later in the game.\n-Even if you don't go Psi, invest enough cybernetic modules for Psi-Pull and Cryokinesis early on. This gives you access to many secrets as well as a modest fallback weapon when your guns jam or the bullets run dry.\n-Don't horde syringes. Strength Boost + Speed + Wrench works wonders on spiders.\n-Hacking, hacking, hacking. Those security crates won't crack themselves.\n\nLastly, don't spend too much time fretting over cosmetic graphics and balance mods. The game looks and runs fine in vanilla mode.\n\nLight some candles, put on some headphones, and enjoy one of the best FPS / RPG hybrids ever made!","May 29","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a game which is completely ahead of its time by all means, it has a powerful story, an awesome pacing, well crafted narration and the gameplay is so unique there are tonns of options you can use while playing. These options are basically character development, you have a deep system of Stats, Skills and Attributes just like an RPG game and thus adds up to the replaybility. Even weapons come in variety and you have to stick to a specific class of weapons, energy based, bullet based, explosive, melee or even your cybernetic powers like telekinesis and stuff. There is a lot of exploration, you scavenge the environment for ammo, health and other things to survive, the premis of the game speaks for itself, story comes to you by means of PDF's and audiologs found all around the area.

This is a game which is completely ahead of its time by all means, it has a powerful story, an awesome pacing, well crafted narration and the gameplay is so unique there are tonns of options you can use while playing. These options are basically character development, you have a deep system of Stats, Skills and Attributes just like an RPG game and thus adds up to the replaybility. Even weapons come in variety and you have to stick to a specific class of weapons, energy based, bullet based, explosive, melee or even your cybernetic powers like telekinesis and stuff. There is a lot of exploration, you scavenge the environment for ammo, health and other things to survive, the premis of the game speaks for itself, story comes to you by means of PDF's and audiologs found all around the area. The story is suspense and as it unfolds, it drops your jaw.\nThe atmosphere is thick and the musical score if composed by non other than the pioneer Eric brosius.\n\nThis game comes from the same people who later on developed Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, this is Ken Levines first Master Piece...Im not a fan boy but i can confidently say that SS2 does a lot many things much better than Bioshock.\n\nIf you like Cyberpunk, RPG, FPS or even if you liked the first Deus EX, YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME...","February 27, 2014","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This includes setting the difficulty in most games to a high enough level that it requires me to put thought into how I invest my limited resources, yet not so difficult that I'm trying to save precious ammo (or health, etc) by fighting a single fight only to run back to the last point of safety to re-group. I also appreciate (somewhat) linear narrative games with in depth plots and character building...\n\nREVIEW - I found this game extremely enjoyable for almost it's whole duration. The plot was something I could imerse myself into and get hooked. The character depth was slightly limited (with respect to some of the newer games that have come out) but not so much that it felt like it lacked something. Putting myself back into the year this game was released, I would have indeed called it revolutionary. A great game overall.\n\n(SPOILERS) However...\nI was extremely irritated by one HUGE miss... throughout the game, the choices I made left it literally impossible to defeat the final boss. I had chosen to invest my point in skill other than hacking, which when it came time to fight SHODAN without ICE-picks it was literally impossible to defeat her. I did not find this out till later. I spent a long time fighting her, intrigued and perplexed by the difficulty, I kept telling myself that there was something I'm missing. This increased my anticipation for the moment when I finally figured it out. Eventually I explored what seemed like every option. I resorted, to what I consider my LAST resort, I looked up how to defeat her online. If any of you share my personality, you know how difficult a choice this was. What I discovered was that, in fact, I was doing all the right things, but because of my choices ealier in the game, I could not finish the game. This left me irritated and frustrated. In my opinion one of the best things about a game is the nostalgic feeling that you get when you think about a game that you had finished awhile back. The final boss SHODAN removed this feeling from this game for me entirely. My suggestion... if you really want to experience this game as the revolutionary and awesome game that it truly was... Put at least one point into Hacking!\n\nIf you take my advice you will experience a great game, unfortunately my own was ruined by a design miss on the developer's part.","February 16, 2015","true","28.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Then you may well enjoy the Serious Sam games...and should probably give THIS one a wide ♥♥♥♥in' berth.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is one HARD sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ of a game.  At first I thought it might just be me - as it so often is - but a quick chat to a Steam friend who's much more of a "natural" at games than yours truly confirmed that not only had he found it challenging, he had in fact found it SO frigging difficult that he just threw in the towel altogether, before the match had even officially begun.  This game is NOT from the user-friendly era which we're so used to nowadays, in which kind-hearted games essentially hold your hand for the entirety of the journey, like an oh-so-generous "self-help" coach who won't let you give up, no matter how hard times might get.  This game is more akin to a brutish boot-camp commandant, who just can't wait to push your worthless face down into the mud one more time, just in case you weren't suitably humiliated by the first ninety-nine times.  In short, this game DOES NOT PLAY NICE.  But for the most part, it does at least play FAIR...unlike, say, the recent Slender: The Arrival, a game whose difficulty can be mostly attributed to rather dubious design and execution.  Whereas System Shock 2, for all its frustration-inducing mean-spiritedness, is in fact an EXCEPTIONALLY well-designed and executed piece of work.  But a game for the weak-hearted or impatient it most certainly is not.\n\nWeapons jam and need to be repaired, frequently.  There's ♥♥♥♥-all healing, certainly in the earlier stages.  And the maps, one of my few genuine "complaints" about the game, almost require a degree in Interstellar Architecture to follow.  To make matters trickier, there aren't any arrows helpfully pointing you in the "right" direction at all times, and it's basically up to you (or the always-generous Google) to work out just what the hell all those items you keep picking up actually do (and which ones you should bother to keep, when your limited Inventory space inevitably fills up almost every time you search a new area...hell, it took me a while to realise that all the pot plants I'd collected were basically extraneous)!  And what about all those different skills you can choose to spend your all-too-precious "cybermodules" on..."What the hell do I need a "Research" skill for, you crazy, crazy game", I hear you cry?!  Well, the simplest answer to that question is, "That all depends on HOW you want to play the game."  Put another way:  Don't expect to explore all the possibilities System Shock 2 has to offer on the first play-through.  I personally didn't even TOUCH any of the "Psi" attributes, and only barely scratched the surface of all that the "Tech" stream of abilities has to offer.  (For all the dumb-♥♥♥ people out there, like me, maybe just stick to being a half-decent fighter to begin with...doesn't take a genius to work out what a gun is for, while the worthiness of the "Hack" skill, for example, may be a tad more obscure at the outset.)\n\nSo okay, I get it, it's hard and it's complicated, but is it actually any GOOD?  Well, one need only look at its LEGACY to see how important and influential this game has been.  Unfortunately for System Shock 2, it appears to have been released at much the same time as a certain tiny little piece of gaming called Half Life, and it would appear that that game and its subsequent franchise stole much of SS2's thunder.  But have you also heard of a series called the Bioshock games?  Well, this is the "spiritual predecessor", designed by much the same people.  You can also spot the influence this game has had on, say, the Dead Space and F.E.A.R. franchises from several small galaxies away.  The more "RPG"-ish aspects of Borderlands, et al, would also appear to owe something of a debt herein, what with the space-age vending machines you can use to purchase items and ammo and healing and what-not from.\n\nA true trail-blazer of a game indeed.  But how do the graphics and sound stack up against modern games, then?  Well...okay, the graphics have dated a little.  But they're more than made up for by some of the most imaginative and downright disturbing sound design in VIDEO GAME HISTORY.  It's nothing less than a work of art, ya'll.  And the story, while suffering from the limitations which are unavoidable when you're talking about a game where you basically traverse large distances while killing lots and lots of "baddies", is about as good as you can reasonably ask such things to be.\n\nLook, it's not a completely "perfect" game.  As well as the aforementioned maps, there's other frustrations to be overcome and/or tolerated, such as the incredibly irritating tendency for a completely random "wandering" enemy to waltz into the room in which you thought you might finally have sufficient breathing space to listen to that "PDA" you've been carrying for the past several minutes.  You're gonna have to learn to do things like bring up the Inventory screen and heal yourself WHILST RUNNING down a corridor avoiding enemy fire.  And most of all, you're gonna learn to Save just about every time you pick up a new item or defeat a fresh enemy.  But with a little patience and just a teeny tiny bit of skill - Lord knows, I have precious little of the latter - you might actually manage to defeat the completely insane HAL - whoops, slight slip there, make that SHODAN - and emerge triumphant in a world ruled over by rampant technology.  Sounds like a nice change from your "real life", day-to-day existence, don't it?\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who enjoys a not-entirely-mindless "shooter", and an absolute must-play for anyone with an interest in the history of such games.  Doom, Quake, Half-Life, THIS...that's just about the list, I believe.  I guess I should probably play System Shock 1 some time, too...dang, no rest for the wicked...\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.","July 6, 2014","true","32.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

If you didn't know, that should be enough to convince you, but let me re-iterate it's historical importance and worthiness.\n\nThis is the game that not only inspired Bioshock, but everything else like it since (that includes anything from Fallout 3/NV to TES: Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim to Borderlands). Here's the basic formula: they took an FPS, added actual RPG elements, a real story, plus a horror atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi theme, and basically created a new genre. That's pretty significant, so if you've played Bioshock and haven't played this, you really should be ashamed of yourself... Fortunately for you, all hope is not lost as SS2 is now available on Steam and fixed to run on modern rigs so you may yet redeem yourself by playing it. Yay!\n\nA word of advice, though SS2 looks and sounds as old as it is, there are excellent texture/model/sound replacement mods available and they work fine with the Steam version. Despite all that, it still feels and plays better than most games of the genre today and remains a very special and highly memorable gaming experience nonetheless.\n\nLet me assure you that if I could have but one single wish answered by the Gods of Gaming it would be for a proper, actual sequel. But for some stupid reason, the license rights are of course tied up in limbo thanks to the absolutely rificulous bureaucratic state of the world, and so us poor gamers are left to suffer without it.\n\nGame like it was 1999!","May 16, 2013","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Therodel/recommended/238210/","Therodel","Zachrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Therodel/","165 products in account","As one of the all time survival horror classics, System Shock 2 has been on the top of my to-do list for a while.  Now that I've finally finished the game I've been telling myself to play since 2007, here's my thoughts:\n\nStory: The story was very well done, and it shows how much it's influenced future games of its type, like Bioshock and Dead Space.  The basics are simple enough: you wake up on board a starship with amnesia, and someone starts barking orders into your ear while you're attacked by mutants with wrenches.  Not the most inspired start by today's standards, but what really gets the story moving are logs from other people on the ship.  These recording from before and during the attack build a large world around you (as large as you can get on a spaceship), with other characters carrying out their own subplots around you.  Some of the lines can be a bit narmy, but it's kind of saddening when you find a log from a character you've been hearing of for the past couple levels, only for it to be a recording of their last moments.\n\nThe active plot is wonderful as well.  SHODAN being the main villian has been spoiled since the original box art in 1999, but the build up to the reveal is quite well done, both in story and atmosphere.  The story about The Many is superb as well, and everything is wrapped up in a satisfying ending.  That's not counting the final boss fight, of course, but I'll get to that in a minute.\n\nAll in all, there's nothing to complain about here.  A very well told story from start to finish.\n\nSound: I'll split this section off into a couple different sections.  The overall sound direction is great: there's a lot of little ambient sounds that add to the atmosphere, and hearing security bots and mutants in the distance makes the game feel very tense.  You'll get a couple jumpscares, too, with unexpected explosions here and there as the ship degrades.\n\nThe actual music in the game is excellent, but some of it doesn't quite fit for it.  On the very first level Med/Sci, you're treated to an energetic techo beat that seems more conductive to running & gunning, like something out of Unreal Tournament.  But, at that point, all you have to your name is a wrench and (maybe) low level Psi powers, so a run & gun style is just going to get your head bashed in with a pipe wrench.  It gets much better after that, however, with tracks that really keep you on edge.\n\nThe voice acting is, to put it nicely, really over the place.  The lead character is mute (save for 1 line at the end of the game), so all of the voice work is done by the supporting characters.  SHODAN and The Many sound great, with SHODAN being a standout performance.  Some of the enemies (like the mutant hybrids) are good, too, and can cause some jump scares hearing their distorted voices coming up fast behind you.  The rest of the cast and logs range from "great" to "hobo they pulled off the street, and are paying with vodka & cigarettes".  Some of the voice acting just...wasn't convincing at all.\n\nGraphics: I won't touch too much on the graphics, considering the age of the game.  It looks great for the time it came out in, looking a lot like Half Life, Thief and the above mentioned Unreal.  The level design was outstanding as well: I never found myself getting lost, and the setup of the ship makes as much sense as a starship would make.  A special note goes to the final two levels of the game in terms of level design, but I don't want to spoil to much here.\n\nGameplay: the gameplay is just as polarizing as the sound direction is.  The core gameplay is a pretty functional FPS, with some platforming in a few places.  There's some RPG elements in the form of 'Cyber Modules' that you earn by completing plot related objectives, as well as by looking in some hard to reach places.  These Cyber Modules can be used to upgrade profeciency with weapons and tech related things (such as Repair and Hacking), increase your base stats, or unlock psionic abilities.  It's a pretty neat twist to the Fighter-Mage-Thief setup that many RPG's use.  The game gives you a lot to choose from, and no two characters are going to have the same build (unless you're reading from a guide or something).\n\nHowever, these same RPG elements are one of the core failings of the game.  The above mentioned weapons you can train in are horribly imbalanced: some weapon classes are much better than the others, and picking the wrong build (or running out of specific ammo near the end) can render the game completely unwinnable.  It's especially apparent in the final levels of the game: the second to last level renders an entire set of weapons useless, while the final level renders another set of weapons (one that was good against the enemies in the previous level) equally worthless.  If you relied on only one of these sets of weapons during the game, then time to restart!  This is more likely to happen on Impossible difficulty, however: Easy and Normal give you more than enough modules to modify your build if you notice anything wrong, and even Hard is pretty generous with them once you're on deck 3/4.\n\nThe RPG elements also add some replay value to the game.  While I completed the game with a lot of Tech and Standard Weapons training, I may do a 2nd playthrough as a completely Psionic character next.  The difficulty also spikes the higher you go, and I'm honestly dreading trying up the game on Impossible.\n\nOverall: An extremely well told story and some legitimate scares, woven into a functional yet flawed FPSRPG.  If you're considering this game, the biggest question to ask yourself is this: can you stomach 'meh' gameplay for a great story?  If so, I highly recommend this game.  But, I can freely admit it's not everyone: feel free to stay away if you're not into survival horror games, or if you like your FPS's feeling a bit less 'broken'.","July 21, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean, the engine couldn't be too powerful, how scary could they make it?\n\nVery.\n\nMany games come with the recommendation "take a break between every hour of play", but this is the only game where I've actually done that. Although this game does have the occasional jump scare (turning a corner in to a previously empty hall and there's a monster RIGHT THERE), most of the terror is of the slow, suspenseful kind, where you're sitting on the edge of your seat, are quietly mumbling "moommmyyy" and wish that blasted light in your ceiling fan didn't flicker ominously.\n\nThis game has aged wonderfully, and is well worth the price - especially if you can pick it up on a sale!\n\nHowever, there are some caveats. There are five kinds of people that should not get this game:\n\n1: Graphics snobs. This is an old game. Don't go in to it expecting Crysis.\n2: People with weak hearts.\n3: People that like being able to sleep at night.\n4: Small children (This should be self explanatory, but y' never know.)\n5: People absolutely incapable of forward planning. No respecs in this game (Although it does allow for save-scumming if you feel like it.)\n\nIf you don't fall under those categories, and you like the idea of scrambling for survival in a spaceship infested with horrors-that-cannot-be-more-specifically-described-because-it-would-ruin-the-plot, then get this game.\n\nOr put it on your wishlist and wait for a Sale. You already have a huge backlog of games already (we all do!), and this game gets massively discounted during Steam Sales.\n\n","August 6, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Therodel/recommended/238210/","Therodel","Zachrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Therodel/","165 products in account","As one of the all time survival horror classics, System Shock 2 has been on the top of my to-do list for a while.  Now that I've finally finished the game I've been telling myself to play since 2007, here's my thoughts:\n\nStory: The story was very well done, and it shows how much it's influenced future games of its type, like Bioshock and Dead Space.  The basics are simple enough: you wake up on board a starship with amnesia, and someone starts barking orders into your ear while you're attacked by mutants with wrenches.  Not the most inspired start by today's standards, but what really gets the story moving are logs from other people on the ship.  These recording from before and during the attack build a large world around you (as large as you can get on a spaceship), with other characters carrying out their own subplots around you.  Some of the lines can be a bit narmy, but it's kind of saddening when you find a log from a character you've been hearing of for the past couple levels, only for it to be a recording of their last moments.\n\nThe active plot is wonderful as well.  SHODAN being the main villian has been spoiled since the original box art in 1999, but the build up to the reveal is quite well done, both in story and atmosphere.  The story about The Many is superb as well, and everything is wrapped up in a satisfying ending.  That's not counting the final boss fight, of course, but I'll get to that in a minute.\n\nAll in all, there's nothing to complain about here.  A very well told story from start to finish.\n\nSound: I'll split this section off into a couple different sections.  The overall sound direction is great: there's a lot of little ambient sounds that add to the atmosphere, and hearing security bots and mutants in the distance makes the game feel very tense.  You'll get a couple jumpscares, too, with unexpected explosions here and there as the ship degrades.\n\nThe actual music in the game is excellent, but some of it doesn't quite fit for it.  On the very first level Med/Sci, you're treated to an energetic techo beat that seems more conductive to running & gunning, like something out of Unreal Tournament.  But, at that point, all you have to your name is a wrench and (maybe) low level Psi powers, so a run & gun style is just going to get your head bashed in with a pipe wrench.  It gets much better after that, however, with tracks that really keep you on edge.\n\nThe voice acting is, to put it nicely, really over the place.  The lead character is mute (save for 1 line at the end of the game), so all of the voice work is done by the supporting characters.  SHODAN and The Many sound great, with SHODAN being a standout performance.  Some of the enemies (like the mutant hybrids) are good, too, and can cause some jump scares hearing their distorted voices coming up fast behind you.  The rest of the cast and logs range from "great" to "hobo they pulled off the street, and are paying with vodka & cigarettes".  Some of the voice acting just...wasn't convincing at all.\n\nGraphics: I won't touch too much on the graphics, considering the age of the game.  It looks great for the time it came out in, looking a lot like Half Life, Thief and the above mentioned Unreal.  The level design was outstanding as well: I never found myself getting lost, and the setup of the ship makes as much sense as a starship would make.  A special note goes to the final two levels of the game in terms of level design, but I don't want to spoil to much here.\n\nGameplay: the gameplay is just as polarizing as the sound direction is.  The core gameplay is a pretty functional FPS, with some platforming in a few places.  There's some RPG elements in the form of 'Cyber Modules' that you earn by completing plot related objectives, as well as by looking in some hard to reach places.  These Cyber Modules can be used to upgrade profeciency with weapons and tech related things (such as Repair and Hacking), increase your base stats, or unlock psionic abilities.  It's a pretty neat twist to the Fighter-Mage-Thief setup that many RPG's use.  The game gives you a lot to choose from, and no two characters are going to have the same build (unless you're reading from a guide or something).\n\nHowever, these same RPG elements are one of the core failings of the game.  The above mentioned weapons you can train in are horribly imbalanced: some weapon classes are much better than the others, and picking the wrong build (or running out of specific ammo near the end) can render the game completely unwinnable.  It's especially apparent in the final levels of the game: the second to last level renders an entire set of weapons useless, while the final level renders another set of weapons (one that was good against the enemies in the previous level) equally worthless.  If you relied on only one of these sets of weapons during the game, then time to restart!  This is more likely to happen on Impossible difficulty, however: Easy and Normal give you more than enough modules to modify your build if you notice anything wrong, and even Hard is pretty generous with them once you're on deck 3/4.\n\nThe RPG elements also add some replay value to the game.  While I completed the game with a lot of Tech and Standard Weapons training, I may do a 2nd playthrough as a completely Psionic character next.  The difficulty also spikes the higher you go, and I'm honestly dreading trying up the game on Impossible.\n\nOverall: An extremely well told story and some legitimate scares, woven into a functional yet flawed FPSRPG.  If you're considering this game, the biggest question to ask yourself is this: can you stomach 'meh' gameplay for a great story?  If so, I highly recommend this game.  But, I can freely admit it's not everyone: feel free to stay away if you're not into survival horror games, or if you like your FPS's feeling a bit less 'broken'.","July 21, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game fascinated me from the first moment with its atmosphere and chalenging gameplay. As someone who rarely plays shooter i got sucked in by the setting and mostly the fact that this game isnt the usual splatter horror  or some fancy action shooter, but a rare gem, that shows that it is possible to build a story driven shooter that has more to offer than simple run and gun spiced with some rpg elements. The game gives ppl the possibility to play smart, as it requires some amount of skillpoint, inventory, health and ammunition management and requires the player to tend to his weapons, as they can break if not maintained and can be upgraded (nothing fancy, just sth like lvlups). All of those actions require some skills that can be accuired for your character. Those features would be considered "fun-stoppers" nowadays, but honestly this is what makes games playable for me. This game was made by the ppl who later developed the "Bio Shock" games (the name is similar), this  game is the spiritual predecessor of those games and i liked it more than Bioshock. This game is aswell considered a classic as it influenced many games modern A+ titles, e.g. Portal (it is said that "Glados" from portal is inspired by "Shodan" from system shock) and Dead Space (inspired by the gameplay of System shock 2).","July 13, 2014","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay was certainly ambitious in 1999; FPS+RPG elements; well, its successor BioShock saw very little need to update the formula. I like to think of this as "BioShock done right," which is both correct and cringeworthy.\n\nSHODAN is a proper, taunting villain and unreliable narrator. The game has good pacing and a good story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravingmonk/recommended/238210/","ravingmonk","MONTY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravingmonk/","68 products in account","'System Shock 2' is terrible...at first. If you play the first hour then give up never to install the game agin, I wouldn't blame you.\n\nEven on the easiest setting, you start the game and suddenly your taken through a series of choices that do things to your character you don't understand. Then your placed into a fight and find out that you chose everything wrong and must start all over again. Repeat about four times and eventually you'll be able to get through the first level. Then you get to the second and yell "OH FOR GOD SAKES" at the screen as the game does the 'Half-Life 2' method of story-conflict by giving you a really simple objecive - take an elevator to Deck 4 - then adding various numbers of contrived complications.\n\nHere is how the game starts: You wake up, try to take the elevator, find the power is down and you must go down to the Engineering Deck. But the door to Engineering is locked, so you have to get the code from an NPC. You try to get to his quarters, but the door is locked. You find the key, only to find he's not there - he's in his office. So you go to his office and he gives you the key. Then you get to Engineering only to find it's flooded with radiation and you have to clear it - but to clear it you need to access a locked door, and the key is in the cargo bay. Once you unlock the door, you find the computer is broken so you have to travel across the level to fix it. This is all just to ride a stupid bloody elevator!\n\nIf you can just accept that it's going to take you three levels and almost four hours of gameplay just to ride a elevator, and once you've worked out that the best way to play the game first time is to screw the fancy PSI powers and use a Shotgun and Assault Rilfe combo then you are in for a blast.\n\nLittle things such as the fact the game doesn't pause whilst you fiddle with your inventory will at first be an annoyance, but once you finish this game and return to another - you'll miss it. There is nothing more frightening than trying to do something with your interface when suddenly a hybrid pops up and you have to quickly close it down and fumble with the hotkeys until you find your melee weapon. The 'fiddly' nature becomes necessary, as does the unforgiving nature of the rest of the game.\n\nThere are two reasons why this game is surprisingly terrifying despite it's dated graphics:\n\nFirstly, you feel vulerable throughout. The game only gives you enough tools to get by, and if you squander those tools then it's your fault. It may feel like your being showered with upgrade points, but if you waste those points then they're not coming back. There is also a catch to everything. Your melee weapon never deteriorates, but of course melee leaves you highly exposed to ranged attacks - which almost all the enemies use. Your shotgun can't attack robots, your Assault Rifle degrades like it's make of paper, your Grenade Launcher uses rare ammo, and you need to research Exotic Weapons before you can use them...plus the ammo is even rarer. It's the complete opposite to 'Bioshock's approach - where the right combination of weapon upgrades, tonics, and plasmids can completely break the game.\n\nSecondly, want to know where 'Bioshock' ('System Shock 2's lesser, yet still worthy son) got it's outstanding atmosphere from? Due to how underpowered you feel, your already scared of enemies - but they all have unique, terrifying sounds that make you dread their presence more. The audio-logs are not as well voice-acted, but there are more of them and they progressively become more disturbing throughout; much more so than 'Bioshock'.\n\nThe only problems with the game are how the story often takes the ♥♥♥♥ (there's a combination lock, and the only way you can find the code is to go round this large level - that you've already been around about three times - looking at paintings. Or...you could just look the code up online) and the ending feels like the developers ran out of time - and that's because they did. The final few levels become much more linear, which is a shame because the last map introduces an ingenious concept that should have been expanded on, and the ending cutscene is laughably bad. It's still not as bad as the ending of 'Bioshock' - although 'System Shock 2' suffers from the same compulsive need for a 'big boss' when this is a game that's above such cliches.\n\nOverall, 'System Shock 2' is like ramadan. It might be gruelling at points, but you will emerge a completely different person.\n\n(There is no need to play 'System Shock 1' before this. Just look up the plot on Wikipedia to get the story so far.)","July 26, 2014","true","48.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes System Shock 2 so special is that it was the predecessor for modern fps games. The mechanics in this game may not feel new, but System Shock 2 was released in 1999. This game was years ahead of its time in terms of gameplay. System Shock 2 is quite atmospheric and is pretty damn scary at times. You have basic skills such as weapons, computer hacking, repairing, and psi powers that you can level up as you progress. You can basically play the combat however you wish, either using melee weapons, guns, or psi powers (kinda like a mage). One thing I have to compliment on this game is just how good the sound and voice acting is. The music is awesome and the voice acting is just superbly done. I can't think of any bad things about this game. System Shock 2 is the progressive title that modernized and ushered in a new era of FPS games. If you like atmospheric FPS, I highly recommend System Shock 2. This is the pinnacle of the genre. System Shock 2 takes about 15 hours to complete.\n\n10/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)","August 9, 2013","true","26.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are a soldier assigned to a great expedition ship. You awaken to find out that everything has gone pretty bad. Basically you will find a lot of things that all seem to try and kill you. The game is challenging and unforgiving. Your weapons fail, your ammuntion will run low and every now and then you there is an enemy lurking right next to you scaring the crap out of you. This will force you to be focused all the time adding a certain tension to the game.\n\nThe tension is enriched by a deeper plot line. After all your puny existanse is a small thing compared to the fate of the ship and so on, and there are people that will remind you of it. To make a few quote "You must move faster. Your mind cannot conceive of the stakes we are dealing with."\n\nThis is only a glimbse into to the game and revealig anything else would be a major spoiler =)\n\nStrongly recommended.

It is one of the best shooters i have played so far, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. With a great sound system, a menacing antagonist who will occasionally appear to make you feel more uncomftorable than you thought possible (and then some), and some nice level design, there is alot about this game the developers did right. There is an average variety of enemies who can, at times, prove a real challenge and some controls that you will have to get used to. However, once you look past that, there's not much bad about this game. With the main setting in space on a ship that has been through everything you can imagine, there are several sectors that you will get to explore, very nice level design, and sound that goes along great with the enviornments of the game. Shock 2 also has a nice RPG element to it, with three classes to master, which are the Psychic, Soldier, and Hacker. These classes come in handy in situations from fighting enemies to outsmarting complex security systems. The game's story is nice too, with some twists that will leave you astounded, and an interesting back story that will keep you wanting more. With all of this in one game, i would say the only real flaw is the textures of the characters and levels. However, this is a minor flaw at that, and with everything else to make up for it (and considering the time it was made), this game is a must-have for survival-horror fans and shooter fans alike.","August 23, 2013","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A truly amazing game that is still really fun to play even though the graphics are a bit dated.\n\nThere are 3 branches of Service to go into at the start of the game. The Marines the Navy and the OSA. The Marines are tailored towards heavy, energy and standard weapons to make the most use out of those, while at the same time be a walking tank.\n\nThe Navy lets you get more technical skills such as being able to hack into computer systems or replicators, and let you research objects in the game to expose the weaknessess of your enemies and discover exotic alien weapons, armor and implants.\n\nThe OSA are tailored around Psionic disciplines which let you use an amplifier to shoot out large balls of energy at your enemies, increase your resistance to damage and heal yourself among other abilities.\n\nDon't like horror games?

Something I have always held up as an example of excellence in game design.\n\nThough I played it nearly a decade after its release, it was still a far scarier and far more emotionally gripping experience than any "horror" game I have played to date.

However, one question that comes to mind is this: Does System Shock 2 still hold up today as a truly spectacular action-horror experience? In my perspective, the answer is really not that simple.\n\nIn case no one has ever heard one of Irrational Games's very first foray into video games (since they had no part in the prequel), here's the premise: 42 years after the events of the first game,  you control a lone survivor trying to find out the reason for why a technologically genetic outbreak has devastated the starship he's on called the Von Braun. However, through hearing audio logs left by the deceased crew and witnessing the abominations brought out by the infection, you must put a stop to it while staying alive, even if it means forming an alliance with your worst enemey.\n\nLet me just start off with what I feel System Shock 2 does the best at: atmosphere. This is largely in part to its extremely exceptional audio design. While a few of the sound effects leave a lot to be desired (some of the guns sounded iffy and not that powerful to me), they managed to incorporate a creepy ambiance with the use of miminal sound courtesy of mostly background noise. It truly brings a good amount of tension to the game, especially when you don't know what's going to occur next. It's subtlety like this that really adds to the turmoil and uneasiness within the game. The frantic techno music, however, sounds out of place and doesn't accelerate the stressful situations you will face. Plus, I may be one of the only people who didn't find this game to be all that......scary. There were a few moments which provided a fair share of jumpscares (mostly from enemies waiting right when you enter a door), but I felt that it didn't warrant high praise. There is, however, one aspect of the game that left a very dark mark in me, and that will be explained right now.\n\nHow they mixed the vocal performances is something to admire, especially in the cases of the Many, where the voices are multi-layered and showcase a very unsettling tone to their threats, and Shodan, who is the most terrifying of them all, exhibiting a uncomfortable stutter with a barrage of fluctuating vocal patterns, malfunctions, and a combination of three different voices to make you cringe. There's other vocal performances to be had here, but they can make you cringe for the wrong reasons. These come from the audio logs read from the majority of the characters. Despite adding in some much needed backstory and dimenson to the overall plot, the actors/actresses that comprised a good chunk of them just sound horrible; exhibiting a stale and wooden facade that wouldn't make you take the accounts of their circumstances seriously. (Like they just had some staff members "read" from the script and called it a day). There are a few exceptions, but don't play this game looking for some high quality voice-acting (though Shodan's voice actress REALLY make you fear her). For a time when voice acting wasn't a huge prevalent factor in video games, this is only a minor nit pick and shouldn't ruin the entire experience at all.\n\nThe story is decent enough. It often felt a tad predictable and even ends on a mostly sour note for me, but the audio logs (that I mentioned earlier) really add a lot of depth to the game. The interaction you have with either the Maker or Shodan also adds a lot of character and fear amist the insults and "praise?" you receive. It's no wonder these were further implemented in future games, especially in the case of Irrational Games' later masterpiece series, Bioshock. Overall though, it's not a terrible story by any means. I just didn't find it that memorable. Where it gets it right, however, is with Shodan. She is, perhaps, one of the most frightening villians ever to be conceived. Yes, the idea of a artificial intelligence getting a corrupted conscious and trying to play God isn't new, but her dialogue and speech patterns are the things of future nightmares.\n\nThe graphics, unfortunately, have not aged well. While the overall level design remains influential and well-designed, and a good portion of the creature and gun models do have a nice amount of detail to their design, the models look extremely outdated, displaying ugly, blocky textures. It also doesn't help that the game suffers from the occassional glitch and bug, especially in terms of enemies phasing through doors and objects as well as some you aren't even able to kill. Here's hoping that I was the only one who dealt with that inconsiderate predicament.\n\nThere's hardly any complaints with the controls at all, as they felt intuitive and very responsive to the action. You may suffer from a hint of lag, however, when you try to jump.  This led me to a good amount of frustration in the long run. Other than that though, I was most pleased with how well it controled.\n\nLastly, the gameplay aspect is where I felt the most conflicted. For one, it incorporates the standard first person shooter genre with the traditional gunplay. However, it also adds some character customization to the mix (thus giving forth its RPG elements). You can either become a battle hardened soldier with access to some top-gear guns, a Navy officer with a mastery over research, hacking, modification, and repair, an OSS soldier with mastery of Psionics (where it be shooting ice, pulling objects to you, or much more), or a combination of them all. You can upgrade your skills, as well as your overall stats, by collecting cyber Modules usually won for completeing a task (some can also be found). While this can lead to some diverse tactics and unique customization, I felt like it can often feel unbalanced. This is especially true if one wants to develop skills outside of their job choice, but I thought it held more leniency towards the Navy class. This is especially true for the most irritating aspect of the game: the weapon deterioation. Your weapon wears off and lacks functionality the more times you use it, and if you don't have much repair/modify skills (or disposal maintenace tools), you normally end up getting rid of the weapon and trying to find a spare one. Seriously though, this system seems way too unnatural as normal guns wouldn't break so easily. It also hurts that resources are quite limited. You have to rely on having good management on your resources because ammo, nanites (currency for buying supplies), hypos (either for medical, psi, brief stat boosts, etc) and more are scarce. If you waste your money too often, you may regret it when you end up running out of ammo, leading to a most unfriendly experience.\n\nWhile the enemy variety is most impressive, their intelligence almost leaves something to be desired. Yes, they can kill you in an instant if you're not properly prepared, but I sometimes just ran up to them and swung my wrench to easily defeat them. It's also not in the enemies' favors when they're often stuck in a loop where they can't get out of (walking towards a wall and keeping the pace, anyone?)\n\nIn conclusion, while the ugly graphics, flawed gameplay elements, and lackluster ending sorta make the game for me too overrated, its stellar sound presentation, terrifying characters, interesting back stories, and overall control scheme still left me with a good impression, as it paved the way for influencing the games to come afterwards. Shodan, you sadistic hater of flesh.\n\n7/10","April 19, 2014","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of the best shooters i have played so far, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. With a great sound system, a menacing antagonist who will occasionally appear to make you feel more uncomftorable than you thought possible (and then some), and some nice level design, there is alot about this game the developers did right. There is an average variety of enemies who can, at times, prove a real challenge and some controls that you will have to get used to. However, once you look past that, there's not much bad about this game. With the main setting in space on a ship that has been through everything you can imagine, there are several sectors that you will get to explore, very nice level design, and sound that goes along great with the enviornments of the game. Shock 2 also has a nice RPG element to it, with three classes to master, which are the Psychic, Soldier, and Hacker. These classes come in handy in situations from fighting enemies to outsmarting complex security systems. The game's story is nice too, with some twists that will leave you astounded, and an interesting back story that will keep you wanting more. With all of this in one game, i would say the only real flaw is the textures of the characters and levels. However, this is a minor flaw at that, and with everything else to make up for it (and considering the time it was made), this game is a must-have for survival-horror fans and shooter fans alike.","August 23, 2013","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's tense and even frightening at times. The atmosphere is wonderfully realised and the audio still stands up as an example for modern developers to be inspired by. I think this is why I can appreciate the game so much more in 2013 than I did back when it originally came out, as its juxtaposition against modern games like the Bioshocks emphasize System Shock 2's accomplishments as even more groundbreaking than they once were.\n\nThe only criticisms I have with playing it in 2013 are temporary criticisms. You'll first want to download a model replacer for npcs. The original low poly models now look a bit silly and clash with the experience the game intends to provide, so get a model replacer mod set up prior to playing.

What a blast.\n\nI'm normally one to have difficulty reverting back to older games as each successive generation comes forward, but System Shock 2 is such a solid game that it betrays hardly any hint of its age (15 years!). I happened to buy it when it was only 99 cents (90% off), and I can say I would easily pay the full $9.99 for an experience like this. I was totally blown away by virtually every aspect of it: the presentation, the story, the RPG mechanics, the action, the intricacy of the environments—even the music.\n\nThe only gripe I have, after playing through the whole game once, is that managing the inventory can be quite frustrating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikriontra/recommended/238210/","Nikriontra","Nikriontra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikriontra/","161 products in account","System Shock 2 is the grandfather of modern FPS shooters. Despite it being quite underrated, System Shock 2 was the influence behind games like Bioshock and Half-Life. It is a dark and gritty game that combines a dark and scary atmosphere with surprisingly enjoyable exploration, crafting and research.\nAs far as the story goes, you start out as a recruit and get to select your main path of game style. You have the Marines which will eventually allow you to get your hands on weapons ranging from pistols to grenade launchers and EMP rifles. You have the Navy, the "tech" class which makes it easier to hack machines and security systems. The last path is the OSA, which specialises in 'psi-powers' which allow you to use your mind to attack enemies, move items and objects from a distance and disable cameras. Afterwards, you are given a selection of three 'subpaths' which give you points in specific skills. Afterwards, you can level up your skills using cybermodules which are generally given to you as a reward for completing missions but you may find them in the world. Players are not restricted to the class they chose e.g those who picked the Marine path can invest their cybermodules in PSI powers. While a "jack of all trades" approach is tempting, it is best to stick to your chosen path because you may find it become incredibly expensive to maintain skill trees at the same time.\n\nWhen you're finished, the game begins. You find yourself onboard the Von Braun, a ship which has succumbed to a strange infection. All hell has broken loose and you must save yourself from the hybrids and other alien lifeforms, and from the psychotic Artificial Intelligence known as XERXES.\nThe player can paint a picture of what happened to the Von Braun through collectibles, which are often recordings made by other crew members. Much like in Bioshock, they also may contain important passcodes and give away locations of important items. Through this method, following the story is optional and all those simply wanting to beat the game do not have to concentrate while a NPC goes on and on. (In this game, the only NPCs who talk to you are SHODAN and whatshernameagain.)\n\nSystem Shock 2 has some of the best level design I've ever seen, and some of the worst. Backtracking is one of the biggest issues this game has. While the levels are big and non-linear allowing for player freedom, they encourage backtracking. As you continue through the game, you are able to explore the Von Braun fully. An elevator located on every floor of the Von Braun allows you to return to an already explored floor (for the purposes of research, farming, healing etc.) What makes the level design superb is that it gives the player not only a sense of discovery and exploration, it also gives the player a sense of confusion and being lost. Some levels contain branches where you have to explore them, find an item and return to the main "hub" part to accomplish a mission to progress further. This does often lead to a sense of misdirection. This is something System Shock 2 does good. That being said, some levels basically have major chokeholds which don't allow the player to use different strategies if an enemy is blocking them.\nEvery level contains security cameras monitored by the rogue AI XERXES. If it spots you, it will activate a security alarm which essentially sends a horde of enemies at you. It is always vital to watch your surroundings.\n\nCombat wise, the game offers a large arsenal of weaponry. Guns, grenade launchers, sabres and many more. Of course most weapons require a specific level in that particular skill line (e.g EMP Rifle requires an energy skill of 6.) As I mentioned earlier, the player is given the freedom to invest in the weapons skill tree even if they picked the Navy or OSA.\nEvery weapon is degradable and you have to repair it if it becomes broken. While this degradable feature does make it substantially difficult for the player if they don't monitor their weapon's level of quality, it can be a bit annoying at times. The player can also modify their weapons using the modify skill, which basically increases the stats of that particular weapon.\nCombat aside, another unique feature of System Shock 2 is Research. On your journey, you may come across an item that is 'unresearched.' To research it, you require a table, and the required chemicals. To get these chemicals, you have to go to a chemical storeroom, which are located in almost every map. However, each chemical storeroom is not identical and you may to have to explore until you find the storeroom with the chemical you need. Upon researching an item, it will tell you what it does. For instance, some enemies may drop one of these items. If researched, it gives you a % damage boost against that particular enemy. While researching objects is an optional feature. It is best to invest in researching, as enemies later on do become difficult and the boost would help.\nPresent in System Shock 2 is a hacking system, where you have to click on squares to create a line. Hacking is used to open crates, hack machines and disable security systems as well as terminating security alarms.\n\nSystem Shock 2 also offers a variety of enemies, ranging from psychic monkeys to annelid spiders and giant robots. As the game progresses, you have to face a growing variety of enemies. It does get incredibly difficult later on. Each encounter with enemies rests on the path you have chosen before. Marines can simply charge in, wreck the enemy and let that be the end of that. A Navyman can backtrack and find a way to avoid the enemy, and a OSA can use their PSI powers to stealthy kill the enemy. Enemies are generally randomly placed on the map, (apart from some pre-set robots.)\nLevels are not saturated in enemies, and there are times when the map can be empty. This gives the player plenty of freedom to explore, and makes each encounter with enemies unique. As the player progresses, enemy difficulty increases substantially. This difficulty can be eventually lowered through research. It does not matter what weapons you have, you will always be underpowered. You have to be incredibly observant of your surroundings, and this is something that System Shock 2 does very well.\n\nPresent in this game is a co-op mode, which allows you to play with two other people! I strongly recommend that you finish System Shock 2 solo before playing co-op, because playing with a partner is a different experience. Knowing that you have backup deducts from the game's overall atmosphere. Co-op, although it is generally stable and bugfree, does contain some issues. (Not surprising for a game made in 1999.) I have encountered some bugs and glitches such as: unnoticable lag where automatic doors open for the host and not for the other players. The elevator can get stuck and won't change the level essentially trapping you (this can be fixed by all players restarting the game.) Enemies can [rarely] get stuck in their default model (aka 'mingebag' ) position and not do anything apart from making noise. A friend and I also encountered a glitch where NPCs would spawn in places they're not supposed to be. (We encountered some live crew member NPCs on one of the decks.) If playing co-op, i would save right before the SHODAN room (Most glitches tended to start after this scene in my case.) Apart from this, Co-op is fun to play with friends.\n\nOn one final note, the atmosphere in this game is excellent in making the player feel weak and underpowered. While the game's music is topnotch quality, it doesn't always fit in with the feel of the game. Regardless, the dark, gritty and scary environments keep the player awake and observant. Just remember to keep in mind that this game was made in 1999 as the graphics have not aged well.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is a must-play for Halflife and Bioshock fans. It combines a range of unique aspects and abilities. it is an underrated yet enjoyable experience.","May 7, 2015","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes System Shock 2 so special is that it was the predecessor for modern fps games. The mechanics in this game may not feel new, but System Shock 2 was released in 1999. This game was years ahead of its time in terms of gameplay. System Shock 2 is quite atmospheric and is pretty damn scary at times. You have basic skills such as weapons, computer hacking, repairing, and psi powers that you can level up as you progress. You can basically play the combat however you wish, either using melee weapons, guns, or psi powers (kinda like a mage). One thing I have to compliment on this game is just how good the sound and voice acting is. The music is awesome and the voice acting is just superbly done. I can't think of any bad things about this game. System Shock 2 is the progressive title that modernized and ushered in a new era of FPS games. If you like atmospheric FPS, I highly recommend System Shock 2. This is the pinnacle of the genre.

However, one question that comes to mind is this: Does System Shock 2 still hold up today as a truly spectacular action-horror experience? In my perspective, the answer is really not that simple.\n\nIn case no one has ever heard one of Irrational Games's very first foray into video games (since they had no part in the prequel), here's the premise: 42 years after the events of the first game,  you control a lone survivor trying to find out the reason for why a technologically genetic outbreak has devastated the starship he's on called the Von Braun. However, through hearing audio logs left by the deceased crew and witnessing the abominations brought out by the infection, you must put a stop to it while staying alive, even if it means forming an alliance with your worst enemey.\n\nLet me just start off with what I feel System Shock 2 does the best at: atmosphere. This is largely in part to its extremely exceptional audio design. While a few of the sound effects leave a lot to be desired (some of the guns sounded iffy and not that powerful to me), they managed to incorporate a creepy ambiance with the use of miminal sound courtesy of mostly background noise. It truly brings a good amount of tension to the game, especially when you don't know what's going to occur next. It's subtlety like this that really adds to the turmoil and uneasiness within the game. The frantic techno music, however, sounds out of place and doesn't accelerate the stressful situations you will face. Plus, I may be one of the only people who didn't find this game to be all that......scary. There were a few moments which provided a fair share of jumpscares (mostly from enemies waiting right when you enter a door), but I felt that it didn't warrant high praise. There is, however, one aspect of the game that left a very dark mark in me, and that will be explained right now.\n\nHow they mixed the vocal performances is something to admire, especially in the cases of the Many, where the voices are multi-layered and showcase a very unsettling tone to their threats, and Shodan, who is the most terrifying of them all, exhibiting a uncomfortable stutter with a barrage of fluctuating vocal patterns, malfunctions, and a combination of three different voices to make you cringe. There's other vocal performances to be had here, but they can make you cringe for the wrong reasons. These come from the audio logs read from the majority of the characters. Despite adding in some much needed backstory and dimenson to the overall plot, the actors/actresses that comprised a good chunk of them just sound horrible; exhibiting a stale and wooden facade that wouldn't make you take the accounts of their circumstances seriously. (Like they just had some staff members "read" from the script and called it a day). There are a few exceptions, but don't play this game looking for some high quality voice-acting (though Shodan's voice actress REALLY make you fear her). For a time when voice acting wasn't a huge prevalent factor in video games, this is only a minor nit pick and shouldn't ruin the entire experience at all.\n\nThe story is decent enough. It often felt a tad predictable and even ends on a mostly sour note for me, but the audio logs (that I mentioned earlier) really add a lot of depth to the game. The interaction you have with either the Maker or Shodan also adds a lot of character and fear amist the insults and "praise?" you receive. It's no wonder these were further implemented in future games, especially in the case of Irrational Games' later masterpiece series, Bioshock. Overall though, it's not a terrible story by any means. I just didn't find it that memorable. Where it gets it right, however, is with Shodan. She is, perhaps, one of the most frightening villians ever to be conceived. Yes, the idea of a artificial intelligence getting a corrupted conscious and trying to play God isn't new, but her dialogue and speech patterns are the things of future nightmares.\n\nThe graphics, unfortunately, have not aged well. While the overall level design remains influential and well-designed, and a good portion of the creature and gun models do have a nice amount of detail to their design, the models look extremely outdated, displaying ugly, blocky textures. It also doesn't help that the game suffers from the occassional glitch and bug, especially in terms of enemies phasing through doors and objects as well as some you aren't even able to kill. Here's hoping that I was the only one who dealt with that inconsiderate predicament.\n\nThere's hardly any complaints with the controls at all, as they felt intuitive and very responsive to the action. You may suffer from a hint of lag, however, when you try to jump.  This led me to a good amount of frustration in the long run. Other than that though, I was most pleased with how well it controled.\n\nLastly, the gameplay aspect is where I felt the most conflicted. For one, it incorporates the standard first person shooter genre with the traditional gunplay. However, it also adds some character customization to the mix (thus giving forth its RPG elements). You can either become a battle hardened soldier with access to some top-gear guns, a Navy officer with a mastery over research, hacking, modification, and repair, an OSS soldier with mastery of Psionics (where it be shooting ice, pulling objects to you, or much more), or a combination of them all. You can upgrade your skills, as well as your overall stats, by collecting cyber Modules usually won for completeing a task (some can also be found). While this can lead to some diverse tactics and unique customization, I felt like it can often feel unbalanced. This is especially true if one wants to develop skills outside of their job choice, but I thought it held more leniency towards the Navy class. This is especially true for the most irritating aspect of the game: the weapon deterioation. Your weapon wears off and lacks functionality the more times you use it, and if you don't have much repair/modify skills (or disposal maintenace tools), you normally end up getting rid of the weapon and trying to find a spare one. Seriously though, this system seems way too unnatural as normal guns wouldn't break so easily. It also hurts that resources are quite limited. You have to rely on having good management on your resources because ammo, nanites (currency for buying supplies), hypos (either for medical, psi, brief stat boosts, etc) and more are scarce. If you waste your money too often, you may regret it when you end up running out of ammo, leading to a most unfriendly experience.\n\nWhile the enemy variety is most impressive, their intelligence almost leaves something to be desired. Yes, they can kill you in an instant if you're not properly prepared, but I sometimes just ran up to them and swung my wrench to easily defeat them. It's also not in the enemies' favors when they're often stuck in a loop where they can't get out of (walking towards a wall and keeping the pace, anyone?)\n\nIn conclusion, while the ugly graphics, flawed gameplay elements, and lackluster ending sorta make the game for me too overrated, its stellar sound presentation, terrifying characters, interesting back stories, and overall control scheme still left me with a good impression, as it paved the way for influencing the games to come afterwards. Shodan, you sadistic hater of flesh.\n\n7/10","April 19, 2014","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/238210/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","System Shock 2 is a mix of FPS, RPG and even survival horror, Irrational Games's sequel to the the Looking Glass's classic using their Dark Engine, released in 1999. You probably know this game as "that some random game that every classic gamer is required to be bonkers about". It also was supposed to come out for Sega Dreamcast but didn't. Shame.\n\nThen in 2013 this game got rereleased digitally thanks to Night Dive studios. Who are quire a heroes, managing to bring this IP out of legal hell, as it was owned by three companies. With some insurance company being one. Now they own it and thus were able to re-release System Shock games so we can all buy it legally and digitally. They also updated the game to work on modern system.\n\nTechnically, this game should work pretty nicely on modern systems. It supports widescreen too.\nHowever I had a strange glitch where cutscene movies will not play if I had Firefox Internet browser running. No idea what was conflicting there. But I guess it's just your everyday PC Oh-So-Master Race thing. HA!\n\nThis game also includes coop multiplayer. Not sure about multiplayer community, after all it doesn't use server browser, you have to connect directly to IP. So don't expect to just play with random, gotta nag friends up.\nAnd from what I heard multiplayer is there because EA, the original publisher, demanded it. It really is single-player experience. So I guess it's something just-for-funz, not designed for. I just know that they would put game on Hard difficulty. But I didn't yet play it.\n\nPlotwise the game is a direct continuation of the first System Shock, a cyberpunk setting. Or sci-fi. SHODAN's returns once again, as spoiled by cover art. But there is a new horror you must defeat as well on Von Braun ship, the first ever Faster Than Light ship with unknown side effects, accomplished by the Rivenbark ship for security. Or rather, because PsiOptimum and UNN don't trust each other.\n\nGame itself is often called a father of Bioshock games, as well as infulencing other FPS games. There are similar things to it indeed. There is a wrench, there is magical PSI powers, there are logs to learn stories and codes.\nYou will explore the ship, trying to survive and often backtracking. Ammo is rare and you often will have to use wrench. While also having RPG system that will decide what you can do and what you currently can't equip.\n\nAnd when compared to System Shock 1 it pretty much adds two things heavily: RPG elements and Survival Horror.\n\nYet I can't help but to feel dissapointment in this mix of FPS and RPG. Probably because I loved the first one more. The first game was about world immersion, it was about combining all the elements into one belivable game. It had RPG elements, but cleverly implented. You was growing in power, but you did it not with some stats management but by finding new weapons and new hardware, which gave you new powers that you also had to use wisely.\nIt also gave you full feeling that it was YOU who was taking on SHODAN. No pointers, no objective clearly written, you had to figure it all out by yourself from logs.\n\nThe sequel hovewer decided to add much more videogamey RPG elements to it, that it pretty much screws the original ideology of System Shock. The stats building ones, yep. And yea, it's one of those cases where the abstraction of RPG elements doesn't fit perfectly with FPS immersion. Like, for example, you need to have at least 3 points in "standard" weapons category to equip shotgun. Like, we aren't talking about shooting horribly, it's about not knowing how to pull the trigger, it seems.\n\nIt also isn't well balanced either. There are options that are much more efficient than others. And some options are so unefficient in how much precious points they require, it's hard for me to say that this game is designed for variety of playstyle. More like for punishing for not knowing what's ahead. It's a linear game after all, with 10+ hours requirement, so it's not sliding. Like, here high investments into hacking, mantaintance and standart weapons are requirements, but no one will tell you so.\nOk, I just did. Welp, at least was lucky that my build was using those so I didn't screw myself.\n\nThat, and it feels a bit more dumbened down as well. Ok, more specific, in the name of RPGness, the hacking mini-games were changed from the proper puzzles into just stat-checking RNG thing. And lots of PSI magic weren't so useful.\n\nSHODAN also felt less signifant here, strange that she gained any reputation of character and made every second person on retro forum have her as avatar because of this sequel. That, and I felt much less like I was the one who was moving on storyline, instead being felt like an errand boy. With all objectives clearly being told to you in PDA notes, along with all codes that you have ever saw, so there is only a single time you have to kinda remember and analyse it yourself ("art" part).\nI mean, it's not exactly what I would usually complain much. I don't hate what people call "casualized" fun. Like it, even. But we are talking about sequel to System Shock 1. And not just sequel, but the one which is called hardcore old classic and has 96 metacritic score and just gets praised as best game ever. And I came in with my body and mind ready for such thing. But oh well.\n\nNot to say that this sequel is a lost cause. After all it adds more of survival horror to it and some of it is awesome! Thanks to technology of 1999 too. It feels even less abstract and more like real ship. And with such technology, it can show horror much more effective. Mind it, there are no jumpscares. Just twisted, trippy things going on, especially as the end comes closer. It really is quite experience. With nice ambient music occasionally. And action ones too.\nHeck, it even makes you often feel unsafe. There is nothing like being busy reading a newly acquired log only to notice a mutant walking into the room where you are hiding.\n\nI also liked the fact that it was taking itself more like survival horror gameplay-wise too, where your ammo and recources are scarse. And everything costs nanities (money thing) now. Well, they kept respawning chamber thing which may not fit with survival, but at least it costs nanities too, even if very very cheap.\n\nIt even makes ammo scarse and all guns are easily breakable. Which sounds like survival horror thing. Almost. Because they didn't manage to balance it right, as early in game guns break so much that they are more scarse than ammo. And later in game the whole survival horror feels to go away and instead replaced by just hard corridor shooter. And hard corridor shooter isn't same as hard survival horror.\n\nNot to mention that while other Survival Horror have "shoot or run" thing, this one has "WRENCH THEM ALL and sometimes shoot". No, seriously, melee there is pretty much for everything aside from worms because they are too tiny. Annoying thing. System Shock 1 also had you using melee a lot, but that was because it was very effective and thus mixing of melee/ranged was fun. In SS2, I dunno, it just isn't. You use unfun melee because game doesn't want you to have fun.\nOkay, I actually had a fun. And as said, I got lucky with my build. Just a shame that in beggining it will not be much fun for most with those gun breakage while at end it deflates. Then again, later levels, after Von Braun ship, are quite generic and mediocre, really.\n\nAlso, research mechanic was interesting. Real-time slow process which also requires visiting chemistry rooms for some chemistry, as there are too many to carry.\n\nBut you know, it's quite a goody adventure otherwise. Albeit not the best game ever, sure thing it's not. Quite overrated. But hey, that happens sometimes. Hopefully System Shock 3 will be more in line of what System Shock 1 was standing for.\nThat, and I want to take one of those maintaince bots to my house. Too cute.","February 27","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Something I have always held up as an example of excellence in game design.\n\nThough I played it nearly a decade after its release, it was still a far scarier and far more emotionally gripping experience than any "horror" game I have played to date. Its systems are statisfying, its world both varied and gratifying to explore, and for once in a game like this the resources you have the manage make the experience more engaging for how it's all balanced together.\n\nAll of the character options are not necessarily balanced, and the finale isn't the best, but the narrative is stellar, the audio design blows a lot of modern games out of the water in many ways for what it accomplishes, and the game is just viscerally fun.

That is the best way to describe System Shock 2.\n\nThe game itself plays like it's predecessor System Shock and it's spiritual successors, the Bioshock series. What makes it different is that players are given the choice on what class to pick based on the military: Navy, Marines, and OSI. The atmosphere is suspensful and oppresive. You'll never know if the next corner has a pipe-wielding crewman with worms sticking out from his head to the torso, a kamikaze service droid, or even spider that was once human.\n\nDespite the graphics being outdated (It was made in 1999 so cut it some slack. There are mods that make it look better), the gameplay itself shines like a diamond, giving replayability for those that want to literally adjust the skills of their character, whether it's spending some cyber-modules on an OSI upgrade to run past enemies undetected or improving your hacking skill so the crate doesn't explode when you hit a bad node.\n\nAnother high point to mention aside from the atmosphere and gameplay is are the audio logs. Each log found gives off a bit of backstory as to what is going within the game, whether it's a conversation between to leaders of the ship you are on or of a scientist who is voicing her concerns regarding what enemey is worse. Another high point to mention is a key character of the game, SHODAN. So as not to spoil too much, SHODAN is someone who will help you out though not without voicing her or its displeasure towards you, especially since you are a fleshy insect.\n\nSystem Shock 2 a game to recommend to anyone that would want to play a good game. If you want an FPS game that has good atmosphere, gameplay, and replayability, look no further than at System Shock 2.","December 28, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It's regarded as one of the best games for PC ever made, as well as one of the best for its genre... and it is wholly deserving of all its praise. System Shock 2 is a game that defies any real review, to do so would to really spoil the experience. It needs to be played to understand why it is so good, and that is what playing it is: an experience.\n\nThe game is a rare example of design, gameplay, aesthetic, atmosphere, and presentation all working in near perfect harmony to deliver an engrossing experience that pulls you in and keeps you going until the final hours are passed. The RPG elements are almost completely free form, allowing you to build your character in almost any way you like focusing on what you want as you want it (though in the early game you'll do well to focus on your initial strengths as to not spread yourself too thin), and while initial enemy placement is pre-determined you'll find out that they respawn with alarming frequency in random numbers and placements to constantly keep you on your toes.\n\nThe game is not perfect, mind, and has some flaws. Most notable are the level designs for the final areas of the game don't seem quite as well designed as the rest of the game and some other small nitpicks, but these are minor gaffes in System Shock 2's excellent imageand are easily forgiven. If you like science fiction, survival horror, cyberpunk, body or eldritch horror, free form RPGs, first person shooters, adventure games, or any combination thereof of them, then System Shock 2 is well deserving of your attention. And hell, even if you don't like any of that stuff, it may be worth looking into just to try new things! You might just find yourself surprised.","March 23, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A learning curve (I feel like I should have read the enclosed game panphlet)\n\nIt was a bit overwhelming for the first 1-2 hours to figure out all the mechanics, stats, and upgrades, but after I got over that hump, System Shock was a heck of a fulfilling experience.","August 23, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

System Shock 2 is a HUGE cult classic, and if I was the kind of person who easily picked favorites, this would have a good chance of being it. If you don't want to read my entire comment here, the summary is at the bottom.\n\nThe most important thing about this game can be summed up in one word, and that is: atmosphere. This game has a dark Drum & Bass soundtrack, and like all old game soundtracks, it's perfectly suited for the game. It adds to the game's horror atmosphere, which has it's strength in anticipation rather than jump scares. Those of you who have played Dead Space, it draws quite a bit from System Shock 2. A horror game on a derelict ship invaded by strange creatures, with logs of the dead giving you an idea of what happened. System Shock 2 invented that and more.\n\nAs Yahtzee said, this is an Action RPG, not an action game with RPG elements. The character customization has a huge effect on your character, and you have to build him carefully. Screw it up, and you'll find yourself in a pretty bad situation, sometimes unable to progress if you really botched it. The higher the difficulty, the more unforgiving that system is, though later game it isn't as bad(in my experience).\n\nSo in short, System Shock 2 is a highly atmospheric, creepy, pioneering, often unforgiving RPG, that is probably one of the best games I've ever played. It's WELL worth over twice it's price, there's no excuse for you to not play it. If you want to be seen as a true gamer and not a stereotypical COD fanboy, or if you just want to experience one of the best games out there, then you may want to add this game to your collection of things you've played. No matter how advanced graphics get today, just like Doom, Quake, Unreal and Deus Ex, System Shock 2 is one of those games that left its mark on gaming, and will never go away.","May 13, 2013","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Hell i honestly like this game more than Half Life.(DON"T HURT ME)\n\nThe music,the atmosphere,gameplay,combat,just huegggggg.\nThe story of this game is well typical. You get sent to a Ship know as the Von Bruan and you uncover what happened on the ship slowly via Audio Logs and exploring. Pretty much your typical Sci Fi space ship horror setting. So story isn't too special but who gives a damn about story when you have awesome gameplay? Exactly. Music fits in with each area.\nSo the gameplay is very unique and fun. FPS elements mixed with RPG elements.\n\nInstead of XP you get cyber modules which are like XP which are gained by exploring and doing the current objectives.\nAnd there's 3 classes to pick from. You can become a Marine,Navy Seal, or O.S.A. Agent.\n\nMarine:Mostly for guns and stuff. Good if you're a fighting type but be careful since weapons have durability+lack of ammo in the beginning decks.\n\nNavy Seal: Mostly focuses on skills like hacking,modifying,computers,repair,ect. Good if you're the type that would rather let the ship deal with lots of problems since you can hack cameras and hack turrets. Also good for beginners of this game.(My personal favorite class too)\n\nO.S.A Agent: Now i'v never played this class but from what i'v seen it focuses on your psi powers which are sort of like plasmids from Bioshock. PSI from what i'v seen is pretty fun and while you're weak in the beginning,you end up becoming a powerhouse later in the game.\nThat's all the classes.\n\nNow let's move onto the ship itself.\nNow the Von Bruan is by far probably one of my favorite video game settings. A huge badass ship with six decks.\nDeck 1:Engineering(Self explanatory)\nDeck 2:Med Sci(Medial and science area of the Von Bruan)\nDeck 3:Hydroponics(Plants and stuff?)\nDeck 4:Operations(Again self explanatory)\nDeck 5:Recreation(Living quarter area of the ship)\nDeck 6:Command(Self explanatory)\nAlso this game has two of the best AIs i'v ever seen. SHODAN and XERXES.\nAnd of course there's the main enemy. The Many, and boy they are like the Flood from halo AKA Creepy.\nAll in all. I love this game,it is seriously IMO one of the greatest games ever created. Sure the graphics are really outdated but a few mods will fix that.\nThis,Serious Sam,Painkiller, and F.E.A.R. have got to be some of my favorite FPS games of all time.\nHow do i rate this game?\n10/10~Everything to love about a FPS AND RPG.\nCan you face a perfect,immortal machine?\n","June 20, 2015","true","86.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Replayed this year.\nAnd i have to say. I'm Impressed!\n\nThis game, is one of the hidden gems that you find rarely, that have all the things that match perfectly.\nI love it, not only for the style, that is actually my favorite one (Cyberpunk) but even for the gameplay itself.\nI cannot recommend this game to normal players AT ALL. It takes a lot of TIME and SWEAT to finish this one.\nAnd if you are here to search for an FPS, you are in the wrong place.\n\nSystem Shock 2 starts in a gigantic ship in the middle of the space that is actually attacked by something unknown.\nYou do not remember anything. You wake up in a cryogenic bed, with everything destroyed and people everywhere that died.\nYou HAVE to FIND a way out to put a end to it all.\n\nPROS:\n+ Fantastic Atmosphere\n+ RPG elements to upgrade and make yourself stronger\n+ Challenging. Hard even on Normal difficulty.\n+ Really INTERESTING Story\n+ Original\n+ Awesome Mapping\n+ You can choose different classes (Heavy, Standard, Energy) and use different guns of every type\n+ The cost is REALLY low.\n\nCONS:\n- The ending is not one of the best ones. But it made me laugh a bit.\n- There's no CHECKPOINTS and AUTOSAVES. Only when you go from a room to the other. And quicksaves doesn't exist either.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nVote 9.5/10\n\nThis game, was a BIG adventure for me, and it's a really good for everyone that actually likes the type.\nI Suggest to EVERYONE that is reading this review to buy it immediately on FULL PRICE.\nIs a real MASTERPIECE of his genre and it values all the money you can spend on.\n\nThanks for reading,\nLaguna's out.\n","April 27","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I could recommend it solely because of the atmosphere it drapes over you. It's the only game I've played that actually reached in through my eye sockets, curled its wires around my spine, and really, truly made me feel powerless.\n\nImagine, if you can, my situation. I am trapped, trapped inside the twisting bowels of a vast machine, with just a little space to move around. And the more I move around, the more I realize, I am tangled in two machines - one of flesh, the other of hissing steel. A voice is guiding me, helping me, but it's just a voice. And as I wrench myself free from deep within this machine, violently stumbling out of the clutches of one chamber and into another, always the steel is watching from my front, and the flesh is grabbing at my heels.\n\nI am never allowed to forget that between my scampering body and the dead vacuum of space lies a thin layer of aluminium and glass.\n\nThis game is not a cake-walk - it's a tough journey and a tough experience. If you like horror, you HAVE TO experience System Shock 2, the acme of the genre. There are a few brilliant moments in the game that made my brain drop whatever it was doing and just kind of kick and whimper. I recall saying things like "Ga! It can't, wait, how? Oh hell, what?? No!" (And I'm a pretty jaded guy.) Some of these moments are big, others are small enough to miss for a while - and then, when they do hit, they hit really, really hard. It's just brilliant, singularly brilliant.\n\nEven with the horror that is the graphical technology of 1999, the visuals in SS2 do a fantastic job. The NPC models are blurry by today's standards, but somehow so disturbing that they never lose their impact. The dying spaceship you're on is a masterpiece of design: corpses and debris are meaningfully scattered, each piece telling an aching story. The stellar sound design (by far, by far, the best I've encountered in any game) begs to be experienced. A sprawling RPG skillset and intrigueing sets of tools and weapons let you survive in any number of ways, all of them challenging.\n\nI recommend playing the original System Shock first (the enhanced edition with all the sounds); it's not essential, but will give you a little more context and back-story. It is definitely worth playing just to experience the first chapter of what I think is the best villain in a video game. SS2 does a great job of painting the full picture, though.\n\nI could host a week-long seminar about the great things this game achieves, but the truth is, you should simply experience it for yourself. Get the game now, and try to play it as coninuously as you can to avoid fragmenting the experience.","May 19","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But considering SS2 was first it basically means BioShock is "FPS System Shock 2 set under the sea". But I digress.\n\nSS2 takes place on the Von Braun, a spaceship that's surrounded by the darkness of space. After training for four years (or four minutes in our lives) you wake up on the Von Braun. If that's not enough to feel claustrophobic, early on you also find out something mysteriously and equally terrifying had happened on the ship on your absence. Guided by another survivor you start from the bottom of the ship and you work yourself to the top to uncover the ship's secrets. No marks, no hints, you're mostly on your own and there's little to no holdings hands (as it should be). Gameplay wise it holds up great, the combat is deep, the pacing is good, and there may be some dated animations here and there, but nothing too serious. Combat can be experienced as a little less flexible than BioShock for example, but that's because you're "stuck" with your current build, due to the skill points you invested in it, which means you can't drastically change your play style in SS2, which was possible in BioShock. But on the other hand, it means the replay value is higher in SS2.\n\nThis is the first time I played this 16 year old game and I'd definitely recommend this for other people who like a good RPG dripping with atmosphere that doesn't hold your hands, like most of the games nowadays.\n\n+ An isolated feeling, claustrophobic, drips with atmosphere.\n+ Main antagonist is very sinister and interesting, good story.\n+ Optional audio logs you can find add to the atmosphere.\n+ Expansive gameplay with lots of options to suit your play style.\n+ Little to no holding hands. There are no markers of any sorts.\n\n-/+ - No subtitles. Which isn't a big problem, even for non-native English speakers like me, but sometimes there's a lot of background noise in-game which makes it a little hard to hear. But there's a log system that you can use to reread most of the dialogues and diaries.\n\n- Some (not all) songs are way too "bombastic' and sound somewhat out of place, they don't have that feeling of isolation and claustrophobia to begin with.\n- Some enemies, at least at first, spawn very quickly, which can lead to some frustration. Especially in the beginning when you're not exactly full on Medical and Psi hypos.\n- The final boss battle ends on a ridiculous and downright out-of-place note that may leave you with somewhat of a sour taste in your mouth. "Nah." The final cut scene after that is good though.\n","August 12, 2015","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a surprising amount of realism available. Firearms degrade with use (A bit quickly, granted, but it's still interesting to see a mechanic like that in such a relatively old game), and those stim pack things slowly improve your health as apposed to automatically switch you from severely wounded to mildly wounded, or mildly wounded to suddenly completely healthy. There's some mild parkour abilities, like holding space to grab onto a ledge at about chest height after a jump, and pull yourself up the rest of the way. There's the ability to level up VARIOUS different abilities/stats. Lots of food/drink/booze/cigarettes available, and there's also no regenerative ability (so far), which is cool. After all, how does one heal in seconds or minutes from blunt force trauma, funky psi attacks, or gunshot wounds? You have limited inventory space, which is larger or smaller depending on your strength.\n\nOh, this game also doesn't hold your hand. Even on Normal difficulty, it's not an easy game. There's no arrows pointing you in the direction to go, and so far there isn't even a minimap. You have to wander around, start to become familiar with your surroundings, and try to manage your way to where you figure you have to go. Ammo is also QUITE scarce, so try to conserve what you can. Luckily there's surgical table things that are automated, and they're scattered around the area. Not very common, however they only cost you 5 nano-whatsits, which is essentially money, so it's worth it to use one if you find yourself under half health.\n\nThe atmosphere is very well done, the graphics are dated of course, but not exactly an eyesore. The story thus far is quite engaging, I find myself enjoying the game immensely in spite of the difficulty and lack of in-game assistance, and I look forward to finding out more. Searching new areas is always enjoyable because you never know what stuff you might find, and you can also backtrack to previous areas if you like. I have kind of an OCD where I have to do things in sequence; I've owned this game for months, but didn't play it because I wanted to find the first one. Finally I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I was missing out. I don't know what else to say about the game other than that I am really enjoying it. If you enjoy survival horror games, then I advise you to check this out.\n\nEven if you're not into using firearms, there's different ways of defending yourself. Different modes of attack, as it were. There's even select fire capabilities, kinda lol Anyways, I look forward to playing it more and seeing how the story turns out. If you don't minds somewhat dated late-90s graphics, enjoy FPS games, survival horror, and the ability to upgrade your character to your own play style, then I truly believe you'll come to enjoy this experience as much, or possibly even more, than I am.","February 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

CalhOUn","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198131446547/","29 products in account","If you enjoy eerie games of the 90s, System Shock 2 is the perfect game for you. You are an unnamed soldier given cybernetic upgrades after being recruited as a crew member of U.S.S Iforgotthenameoftheship (sorry). Your recruitment is essential, as it gives tutorials of the different play-styles (guns, technology, and psionics) and, more importantly, your customization options. You're given 3 classes, or rather careers: Marines, Navy, and OSA members. Marines are your standard class if you want to have a run 'n gun experience. Navy Seals specialize in hacking and strength, and OSA members specialize in Psionic abilities. Customization options continue depending on "missions" you take during a "tour" preparing for your career while aboard the ship. I quote these terms because they are not actual missions filled with action, merely filler explanations as to why you start with certain skills.\n\nAfter performing a your "tours" for three years you are upgraded in your cybernetic form and placed in a cryo pod, only to wake up to ship-wreck crawling with parasite-human hybrids and monkeys. This is where the gameplay begins. It resembles a survival horror game at first, with your only weapon being a bloody wrench. Soon you will discover nanites, or currency, data logs, and cybernetic modules. Data Logs actually contain quintessential information for learning more about the game's story. I actually enjoy listening to them, as they add a new layer of depth to the game. Listening to the logs of now deceased crew members is awfully eerie, meaning that this game is fulfilling its purpose in trying to make the player immersed in an uncomfortable fashion. Cybernetic Modules are the experience points of the game, allowing you to upgrade skills or psionic abilities. These, however, come far and few between, and you have to be prepared to make certain decisions regarding upgrading your skills at upgrade stations because said upgrades are permanent. Do not, I repeat, do not spread your skill points thin. You won't have enough to make it beyond mediocre.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the game is very creepy and unsettling. What makes it even more unsettling is the fact that game is set in space, the setting one would least suspect as a subject for horror. Thoughts of a starship exploring the vastness of space usually leaves one with a sense of pride and overall positive thoughts. But this is no U.S.S Enterprise voyage accompanied by Captain Jean Luc Picard himself, or anyone for that matter. You're essentially alone, left to fend off against twisted creatures that were once human, and, more importantly, the highly intimidating, highly intelligent, highly creepy computer AI known as SHODAN. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is she creepy. Once in a while, when you least expect it, she'll begin a short monologue describing how much inferior you are. Her voice is mangled, fluctuating between an almost human, female tone and a demonic, twisted, deep voice. I almost jumped when she first spoke.\n\nI can safely say that the gunplay is alright, but it is clunky. If you're skill set does not have strong Maintenance, you will discover that guns break quickly, which really gets annoying at times. Furthermore, ammo either runs out quickly, or they cost too many nanites at dispensers (the equivalent to shops). This could either be a good or bad thing. The advantage of limited, expensive ammo is that it adds to the survival-horror element of the game, as it forces the player to conserve ammo and strategize how to plan their next move. The disadvantage is that it can be near impossible to progress without it, especially later in the game when there are more long-ranged threats. Luckily your psionic abilities counter this problem, if you're skilled. Psionic abilities essentially feed off of an energy meter, granting you super powers of sorts. They can come handy, such as the defense and cryokinesis (basic attack) abilities. It definitely adds to the otherwise sketchy combat.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game, however, is your inventory interface. The game does not pause while it's up, which leads to many problems. For instance, the only way to switch weapons is to manually do so through the inventory interface. Now imagine that you run out of ammo for a particular weapon while a few hybrids are chasing you down. You don't have enough time to manually switch weapons before being clubbed to death by the hybrids. But you have to switch weapons if you don't want to lose progress being forced to run back. Furthermore, enemies respawn, meaning that if you visit an old area you might run into even more hybrids and monkeys. There is absolutely nothing you can do except die. I tried switching weapons in a similar scenario and managed to survive, only with 11 hit points and no health packs or healing station in sight. It was even against one basic hybrid while I had armor on. To top it all off, when I made it back, there was another hybrid, waiting for me. The enemy-respawn and user hostile inventory interface add questionable difficulty.\n\nIf you're a newcomer to this game, like I am, I warn you that this is a very difficult game, even on the normal difficulty. However, System Shock remains as one of the more positively sophisticated and creepy games I have ever played, a game that still deserves to be critically acclaimed by many. Just turn off the music while playing; it ruins the creepy atmosphere.","December 23, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The stories aren't directly related so don't worry about jumping straight into this one. The first took place on Citadel Station, where an AI named SHODAN, stripped of her ethical restrictions, went batshit crazy with dreams of Godhood. She failed. Fast-forward 40-some years and you play a soldier on the maiden voyage of a FTL spaceship, built by the same company who was responsible for Citadel Station - TriOptimum. You wake up after cryo-sleep and, conveniently, suffer from amnesia - the favorite theme of infinite game developers world-wide. Needless to say, something bad is happening on board, but I'll leave the rest for you to find out in game.\n\nIt reminded me a bit of Dead Space (or, rather, the other way around - if I had played the games by their chronological release), but it isn't a jump-scare "horror" game as I was led to believe. Creepy, yes. Disturbing, indeed. But it's not frightening in that traditional sense of changing your underwear. There aren't shocking twists and turns in the plot - no wheel is reinvented in this sci-fi space crisis. If you're approaching this at 2014 after being around the gaming and movie block for a while, you'll probably be familiar with most of the developments. You probably know SHODAN as the iconic villain from the game that is well-loved (out of character). I'm sorry for the upcoming blasphemy, but I didn't find her too different from the generic granduer-obsessed villain. Maybe it's because I'm playing this game 15-years late and I've been exposed to all sorts of antagonists. Maybe I'm just a dim-witted gamer who can't see the sophistication. She did have some shining moments, however, that made me realize that this is one messed-up cyber girl. And while my remarks here might make it seem as if I consider the game bland, that isn't the case. I enjoyed the ride, just more due to the gameplay rather than the story (which is the other way around with BioShock: Infinite).\n\nI played System Shock 2 after the BioShock trilogy and was immediately surprised. The amount of gameplay functions was a bit overwhelming at first, especially when you're used to modern gaming standards. I won't list these said functions down because I don't think it'll make any sense to a reader who hasn't played the game. You need to experience it to understand. After the tutorial and an hour or so into the campaign, however, I got the hang of it. More or less. Once I grasped the basics, the further I got into the game the more I felt a growing regret about how criminally streamlined the last installment in the BioShock series - Infinite - is, compared to its ancient ancestor. Now, I ike BioShock: Infinite, I really do. But it pains me to think how magnificent it could have been if it maintained some of SS2's complexity in RPG mechanics.\n\nIf you've played the BioShock trilogy you'll quickly notice the shared DNA. Shock 2 has the audio recordings you probably like (I certainly do) that help tell the story. It has its "magic" abilities (like Plasmids and Vigors), it has hacking of security cameras and turrets, it has vending machines, it has research of enemies, it has big maze-like levels that make you open your map time and time again - and as I wrote earlier, it has a lot more than that; things I enjoyed a helluva lot that I wish were in later games, too. The RPG is strong in this one. From ability scores to expertise in different sorts of weapons, this game offers you much more than your average shooting (which is good, considering shooting in 99's standard isn't as exciting and challenging as it is today).\n\nActually, I should confess about the challenge - I started out on Nightmare (the last out of four difficulty levels), and early on lowered it to Easy. I know, I know. "A filthy casual." Maybe it's becuase I didn't have a lot of time per day to play and didn't want to waste what little of it I had respawning and refighting the same fights. Maybe I didn't enjoy the combat mechancis of a 15-year-old game. Maybe it was just honestly too tough for me. Maybe a bit of all, or something else entirely. I can speculate that on Nightmare this game truly /is/ a challenge. Your HP is extremely lessened, I suspect enemies do more damage, and every upgrade requires many more "Cybernetic Modules" (think of them as XP points you find throughout the game). Maybe one day I'll replay it as a different class (I went for a Tech\Hacker sort) on the highest difficulty, because SS2 certainly has replay value between a Tech focused character or a "Magic" (Psi) one. But it is not this day.\n\nSpeaking of 90s game - the graphics are, obviously, dated. However, I played it with mods which made the game look surprisingly pleasant and I strongly suggest Googling quickly for some prime graphical enhancements.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is a brilliant game whose age isn't half as felt as you might expect it to be, and shockingly offers more complexity than many modern products. A creepy sci-fi setting with an iconic villain, complex RPG mechanics while still capable of being played as a shooter, and a challenge to be found if you have the patience for it. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the BioShock trilogy in particular, and FPS-RPG games that amount to more than taking cover and shooting in general.","November 27, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Luckily there's surgical table things that are automated, and they're scattered around the area. Not very common, however they only cost you 5 nano-whatsits, which is essentially money, so it's worth it to use one if you find yourself under half health.\n\nThe atmosphere is very well done, the graphics are dated of course, but not exactly an eyesore. The story thus far is quite engaging, I find myself enjoying the game immensely in spite of the difficulty and lack of in-game assistance, and I look forward to finding out more. Searching new areas is always enjoyable because you never know what stuff you might find, and you can also backtrack to previous areas if you like. I have kind of an OCD where I have to do things in sequence; I've owned this game for months, but didn't play it because I wanted to find the first one. Finally I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I was missing out. I don't know what else to say about the game other than that I am really enjoying it. If you enjoy survival horror games, then I advise you to check this out.\n\nEven if you're not into using firearms, there's different ways of defending yourself. Different modes of attack, as it were. There's even select fire capabilities, kinda lol Anyways, I look forward to playing it more and seeing how the story turns out. If you don't minds somewhat dated late-90s graphics, enjoy FPS games, survival horror, and the ability to upgrade your character to your own play style, then I truly believe you'll come to enjoy this experience as much, or possibly even more, than I am.","February 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The voice acting and sound design MAKE this game scary and it gives you the feeling of survival, rather than action *coughResidentEvil6cough*. I wish more games would be patient and take the time to set up the atmosphere rather than take shortcuts with cheap jump scares. The only jump scares you get are the ones you create YOURSELF, simply because you don't check behind enough times.

I never thought I'd see the day where monkeys would make me paranoid and make me scared to turn the corner.\n\nIf you're a fan of BioShock, you'll find System Shock 2 to be very similar to that series, is I believe this is the spiritual predecessor to the series. It has great game feel, in my opinion, and it has this eerie feeling to it, and that's just increased so much more by the respawning enemies. Hell, the hybrids still freak me out to this day, and I love it.\n\nWhile it's an old game, it's a damn good one at that, and for $10 it's definitely worth the pick up if you're into sci-fi FPS games, with a horror-theme.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/238210/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","As tends to happen when people don't experience a "classic" until long after they came about, they are sometimes skeptical. I am not very skeptical about games that much, usually. In fact, I will often assume a game is better than what people say, but you can't do much more if they say the game is the "best" ever, which many people say about System Shock 2. But after completing it, I have to say:\n\nPlay this game! Get it! If you've ever wondered about it, don't wait any longer!\n\nThis game has landed in the group of my favorite games of all time. It stands the test of time in just about every aspect. And for a game in the 1990's, that is a great feat. I have played all of the BioShock games before I have played this predecessor, and I have to say that System Shock 2 has pretty much all of the features of the BioShock games, and even more. That is not to say that it suddenly changed my opinion of the BioShock games. They are all put together very well in their own ways and I love them too (hence why I have them on Steam after beating them on console).\n\nSystem Shock 2 is a challenging game, but very rewarding. I will advise not to play on the hardest difficulties on your first try though, as the game will quickly throw you aside. Technically, you don't have to worry about dying if you want to keep reusing the regenerators that you find in each level, but they cost money (unlike in the later BioShock games), thus you can't keep dying forever. However, I find that doing so will ruin the atmosphere of the game, so do your best to play it well; but don't try to be a perfectionist either, or you will ruin the fun that way.\n\nI liked the RPG aspects of the game, being able to modify items and upgrade your character. In some sense, they were just there to make the game harder as you can't use some items for a while, or hacking is worse. But they are still relatively balanced for the most part, except for PSI Powers. Honestly, most of the PSI Powers are useless and even if you invest heavily in them, you won't get that far. I feel like on hardest difficulties, using them at all wouldn't do any good. Others may say you can get far with them, but I just stuck to standard weapons and melee for the most part.\n\nExploring the ship(s) was interesting, as the environments were relatively different in certain decks. The creatures around were very creepy, though eventually wore off on me and I wasn't as freaked out as I was at the start of the game. The game requires you to backtrack a lot at different times, which was rather bothersome, but the story kept me focused, and the audio logs that you find are very well-done for a game made at this time. It is interesting to see how a small set of characters made it (or didn't) through the events with the Annelids.\n\nThe sound in the game was relatively well-done, aiding in the atmosphere. I enjoyed the music itself, but it did take away from the vibe of the game, and also makes it hard to hear enemies at times. Thankfully, it wasn't played that much in most areas, so I left it on. As said above, the audio logs were really well-done. All of the voice acting was great and kept me engaged.\n\nSpeaking of voice acting, the best part of the game was SHODAN. A very interesting character with a very interesting backstory. All throughout the game, I felt very afraid of her, wondering how things were going to turn out. I think that the voice alterations done for SHODAN's audio were perfect and that she made the game entirely. She made the story much better, as I feel like the general exploration and backtracking would have worn you down without such a captivating person (or thing!) at your side the whole time.\n\nThe only thing in the game that didn't really hold up well is the graphics, which isn't that surprising. But most games are still playable if you don't worry too much about the physical appearance. If you are, however, a stickler for how a game looks (even when it's as old as this one), then you'll be happy to know that there are very good mods you can download to improve the looks if need be.\n\nReally, the only thing that disappointed me about the game was the ending. I won't go into any detail here, but many people agree with me. It ruined the tone of the game and was rather sloppily done. I wish there had been something better done with it, as essentially throwing your players' hours of hard work away is terrible.\n\nBut I have to say, play this game. Everything is put together well, especially for when this game was made. I only grew more excited as I kept playing and never got bored. As I said, I think the largest factor of that was SHODAN and the story with her. Easily one of the best video game characters of all time.","February 10, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Music critics have long recognized that the greatest musicians of all times are Beethoven, John Coltrane and The Velvet Underground, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Film critics rank the highly controversial Stanley Kubrick over talentless hacks like Christopher Nolan who is highly popular with folks around the world. Game critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Legend Of Zelda sold more than everything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Music critics grow up listening to a lot of music of the past, movie critics grow up watching a lot of motion pictures of the past. Gaming critics are often totally ignorant of the video games of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that The Legend Of Zelda did anything worthy of being saved.\n\nIn a sense, The Legend Of Zelda is emblematic of the status of game criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it Call Of Duty or Minecraft) and too little to the merits of real developers. If somebody creates the most divine gaming experience but no major publisher picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of game critics will ignore him. If a major publisher picks up a game which is as stereotyped as can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said game. This is the sad status of gaming criticism: The 'journalists' are basically publicists working for major publishers, distributors and multimedia stores. They simply highlight what product the industry wants to make money from.\n\nHopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great video game like System Shock 2, which never sold much, and commercial products like The Legend Of Zelda. At such a time, game critics will study their gaming history and understand which developers accomplished which feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.","October 2, 2015","true","36.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Shock 2 is the one they all spring from and it's still the best and with the help of several mods you can get this old gem looking fairly spiffy. Make no mistake Bioshock is a great game, but it's still just a copy of an even better one.\n\nA perfect merger of first person shooter with role playing game, its difficulty settings scale fairly well for newcomers and veterans alike. To say nothing of an excellent plot with one of the best concieved villains gaming has ever witnessed, they really don't make them like this anymore. Shock 2 is one of the few games that actually managed to scare me and the horrors of the Von Braun still stand out today.\n\nCo-Op is more of a joke since the game losses a lot of its fear factor when you're playing with other people, but it's still fun especially after you've finished a few times alone. There also several patches to rebalance gameplay that are pretty easy to find on the discussion sections for people who are worried about that sort of thing.","August 4, 2013","true","2.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

At first, I was very skeptical as to why there are alot of good reviews on this game because it is almost, if not, 15 years old. So, I watched/read more reviews about it, and it peaked my interest. I bought it on the humble bundle store for a mere $2 and I would now buy it at full price if I didn't already have it. I'm about 10 hrs into the game already and close to being finished.\n\n-Story- (SMALL SPOILER)\nThe story seems generic at first; some unidentified threat aboard a human aircraft in space. The sight of the hybrids didn't help either; however when you start piecing together all the logs/emails you start to notice that it is something more than just alien-like creatures in space. In addition, since I did not play the first System Shock, I was very surprised when I was introduced to the main threat in the game. As I stated earlier, most of the story is threaded by the emails and logs that you collect; some of the story is also given to the player to interpret by the atmosphere and the environment (text written in blood on walls, bullets scattered around the floor next to a human holding a gun, walls torn out showing electrical wiring, etc). Like I said, I'm not finished with the game yet, so the story might completely change towards the end, but I still believe the story is one of the good elements of this game. The only con that I had with story, (SMALL SPOILER) was the absence of living NPCs. The game might have intended for you to feel isolated and alone, but I wanted to hear someone's opinion about the whole disaster without just listening to audio logs.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThe gameplay to me is reminiscent of the old survival horror games such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Dino Crisis in terms of resource management. The layout of the RPG elements remind me much of Deus Ex Human Revolution and Dark Souls 1(you have to carefully attune your skillpoints, if you don't you will die lol). Like all the games mentioned above, the player can choose to go a stealth route or a gun-toting maniac, this allows the player more freedom to choose what type of playstyle he/she wants to do and this is good in a pretty much linear game (although you will need to backtrack at some areas). Also, the tutorial is pretty decent, but in your first hour, if you are like me, you will be confused as a rock as to what exact skills to upgrade and invest in. The only con I would give this game in terms of gameplay is how in the beginning, you are sluggish in terms of movement, which is bad imho because it makes the game feel slow and lengthy.\n\n-Sound Design-\nThe background music and the soundtrack is pretty amazing. The background music is ominous and mechanical. All you head most of the time is the clang and moving gears of machinery and the sound of broken wires. The soundtrack is pretty fitting too; its sounds futuristic and somewhat scary. Although I love the soundtrack, I recommend to turn that down or turn it completely off because its hard to hear the sounds of the enemies footsteps and dialogue\n\n-Graphics-\nThis game was made in 1999, so obviously it is pretty dated. However, if you add the visual enhancements via mods, the game becomes entirely different (There are also mods for music enhancement and other things). So the only gripe I had, was Steam should have released some form of HD version of this game with the mods already pre-installed. Although the mods aren't really a pain to get, an improved and visually ready version of this game would be convenient.\n\n-Overall-\nPros: Story is brilliant, gameplay is top notch, sound design is pretty good\nCons: No NPCs, slow game in the first couple of hours into the game, soundtrack overpowers the brilliant sound design of enemy movement and background machinery, graphics are pretty dated\n\nThis game should be a must play for BioShock, Deus Ex, and Resident Evil fans. Its too good of a Survival Horror game to pass on.\n","June 1, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also you are required to have a research skill of 1, and a hacking skill of 3 in order to finish the game.\n\n-The GUI is awkward to use and just doesn't look good, especially the map.\n\n-Music completely ruins the atmosphere.

Although navigating the inventory can take some time to get use too. The difficulty can be challenging even the easy difficulty.\n\nAs a survival horror game, this game is very creepy (as long as the music is on mute) The main antagonist Shodan is one the best villians I have every seen that she just taunts you through the entire game and sounds creepy as well.\n\nIf you love Bioshock you will love this even more and let people know about this masterpiece, also there are plenty of mods online that can make this game look great","August 12, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Not the biggest, nor the best, nor the one with the best graphics (the enemy models were considered poor even back when it was released, but you can update them now via a community mod).\n\nThe main character (nicknamed 'Goggles' by the community, due to his eyewear) can be upgraded in many ways. There are three main areas of expertise: Weapons, Tech (hacking etc.), and Psionic (magic, basically). On top of that, you can also upgrade your personal stats, like Strength etc.\n\nSadly, this is one of those games where there is a 'right' and 'wrong' way to level up. I will add, though, that it's hard to make your character completely useless. But not upgrading certain skills can make it VERY tough at the end of the game, similar to the Vampire: The Masquerade videogame.\n\nSo why do I think it's the greatest?\n\nAll the parts come together to create something greater than themselves.\n\nBecause, for me personally, they've nailed the atmosphere - and nothing else gets in the way. It's that simple.\n\nFor instance, Deus Ex: Human Revolution does a lot of the same stuff, gameplay wise. But I HATE the 'hacking' in that game with a wrath, which is why I will never reply it, ever. the hacking 'gets in the way'. I also can't stand the story or any of the characters.\n\nThere's only a very few cutscenes - and only the intro and end cutscenes remove control from the character. The rest of the story is told along the way, and the audio logs can fill in the blanks - or be ignored. Compare that to, say, the recent Fallout entries, which remove player agency far too often for me to be able to truly enjoy them. Oh, I LOVE them, don't get me wrong. But I don't need to deal with that at all here, because it never 'gets in the way'.\n\nI can rebind keys effectively (I did not pay for a gaming mouse so that the extra buttons can be ignored, thanks), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.\n\nthe music isn't overly annoying (even if it should have been replaced with mood tracks and ambient sounds), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.\n\nI don't need to install another Steam-like shopfront in order to play a game I bought on Steam (I AM LOOKING DIRECTLY AT YOU, GHOST OF GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE), so that doesn't 'get in the way'.\n\nI don't need to install an inventory mod, because the inventory makes sense to me and doesn't 'get in the way'.\n\nAnd while she's showing her age (well, the game is), SHODAN remains one of my favourite villains in any medium, ever. While her insults can be intrusive on a personal (to the character, not the player) level, they don't 'get in the way' of me enjoying the game.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that really 'gets in the way' for me when I play this game is...\n\n...yep, you guessed it: Real Life.\n\nI award this game 100 Cybermodules out of 10, because I hate maths.","November 7, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is an exploration game that is one you will kind of just wander around through and slowly but surely make progress in. It's kind of cool to see how much bioshock was inspired by this game considering its many similarities. System Shock 2 is at best, a cruel game. Any firearms break down quickly and have limited ammo, so it's impractical to use them. In truth you are better off using the wrench for all your killing needs. If you miss one hit, you could find yourself getting battered to death by a ton of angry polygonal beef jerky monsters that used to be people but now carry lead pipes and shotguns all the while begging you for death.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/recommended/238210/","neogunhero","kuri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/","311 products in account","MOST OF MY TIME WAS SPENT ON A COPY BOUGHT FROM GOG, NOT STEAM.\n\nConsidered by many to be the spiritual precurser to Bioshock, System Shock 2 is a FPS-RPG with stealth and horror elements.\n\nThe gameplay still holds up to this date. While not overly complex, you'll find that the gameplay is more advanced than your average shooter. There are some puzzles here and there that will require you to use your brain or require you to obtain a certain object in order to proceed. The gunplay is fairly standard as well, you point and shoot. Guns have a efficiency rating, so the more you use your gun, the more it will deteriorate. This can be fixed by repairing it.\n\nThe RPG elements come in the form of player stats and classes. There's four categories: Stat, Tech, Combat and O/S. The Stat skill comes in the form of your average stats: strength, endurance, psionics, agility and cyber affinity. Tech comes in hacking, repair, modify, maintain and research. Combat deals with standard guns, energy guns, heavy guns and exotic weapons. O/S helps with your body's operating system, and can enhance it with modifications such as being able to run faster, jump higher, increased stats or being able to do other things.\n\nThe classes include Marine, Navy and O.S.A. Agent. Marines are for the people who love to use guns and overall combat. You first learn to use standard weapons, then later learn to use other weapons. The Navy class is for players who want to play with the Tech side of the game. They are better at hacking, repairing items, modifying weapons and things like that. O.S.A. Agents are the most interesting and fun classes to play, but can also be the most challenging. This class uses Psionic Abilities, which gives you this ball that you hold in your hand that can allow you to do many different things, such as shoot energy balls, telekenisis, heal your self automatically or give you stat advantages.\n\nThe graphics in this game still hold up today. The game looks a lot better than any other game that came out around that time, so better than HL1 or Deus Ex. The textures are smooth and nice, and with a few Steam updates, it runs really well. The athmosphere is at first a somewhat familiar one if you're a fan of Deus Ex or Mass Effect. Set in a futuristic space station, it's been overrun by an AI O/S called Xerxes. Pretty much, him and SHODAN (another AI) control the whole ship and there's zombies on it and other monsters on it. They've also programmed the robots to be hostile towards you. The whole ship is very unsettling. The whole ship has a cramped feeling to it, and combined with it being dark a lot of the times does not help it at all. It really provides a very scary athomosphere when playing.\n\nThe sounds in this game are phenominal. If you're a audiophile, you will not be dissapointed by this. The ambient noises are eerie, the voice acting is surprisingly well for it's time and the music is awesome. I'd recommend using a pair of headphones for this game. Hearing the Hybrid zombies in the other room or the hostile mechs marching across the hallway is always frightening.\n\nNow, for some cons about the game.\n\nFirst off, I feel the interface is dated. It's really small, and doesn't upscale good enough on large monitors. It takes a while to get used to and it's hard to use if you don't have great eyesight.\n\nThis game can be pretty challenging even on easy modes, and while this isn't really a con, it does put a lot of new players off, especially people who don't play older games too often.\n\nAlong with being challenging, the controls are a little wonky. They make sense after you get used to them, but that's the thing, you have to get used to them.\n\nThe lack of a journal system can leave you flustered. You have to make sure you pay attention to the lady speaking to you telling you what to do. PDA's help a little bit though.\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is very great, with very few bugs and cons. Challenging, fun and exciting everytime I play it. I recommend this game for people who are just getting into retro gaming. This is a good introduction into what games were like 15+ years ago. Other than that, I also recommend this to players who like horror games, FPS with more depth than your SHOOT DA BAD GUYZ muscleman games and RPG fans.\n\nMy personal score: 9/10 [MUST PLAY]","January 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","1"

Object interaction is also dynamic: You can drag batteries onto world objects to power them up, drag $ITEM onto $ITEM_2 to kill $SPOILERS, or just drag objects onto the ground to drop them.\n\nLikewise, stealth is a dynamic affair, not limited to simple cover-based mechanics with rows of waist-high crates. The game uses the same stealth system as Thief, taking multiple mechanics into account, including darkness, cover, and sound, with multiple levels of enemy awareness.\n\nFinally, the game's survival-horror elements are made all the stronger by its lack of hand-holding. Instead of relying on cheap jump-scares, SS2 terrifies the player through heavy ambiance and a constant sense of aloneness and vulnerability.","March 9, 2014","true","63.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Play this masterpiece for two-hours and I swear you'll be hooked. It is one of the finest games ever developed and in my time I've just about played them all. The game is creepy, frightening, and intelligently written - enough to make veteran gamers shutter - and that's saying a lot. It's no wonder System Shock 2 has earned a place within the Gaming Hall of Fame. Once in your lifetime you must experience this game. I have only one regret. I wish the developement team that made this masterpiece could be reassembled to give the game a proper make-over with today's moderen graphics. I would tremble like a school-girl at the possiblities.  SS2 holds its rightful place within my top-ten games of All-Time. Its Number One.

Because BioShock took everything it has, from SystemShock 2.\nThat is not even a generalisation.

When games were actually hard? This is system shock 2. A challenging but very satisfying game. The graphics of course are dated but the immersion and atmosphere is not. When you level up your character you pray that you put your points in the right way because you'll regret it at the end when you’re up against powerful enemies. Some things did bug me, like how enemies keep respawning, draining your resources. However that adds to the uneasy feeling of this game that you want to get off this ship as soon as you can. Which- it took me about 23 hours to beat this game so you won't be getting of this ship soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/recommended/238210/","neogunhero","kuri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/","311 products in account","MOST OF MY TIME WAS SPENT ON A COPY BOUGHT FROM GOG, NOT STEAM.\n\nConsidered by many to be the spiritual precurser to Bioshock, System Shock 2 is a FPS-RPG with stealth and horror elements.\n\nThe gameplay still holds up to this date. While not overly complex, you'll find that the gameplay is more advanced than your average shooter. There are some puzzles here and there that will require you to use your brain or require you to obtain a certain object in order to proceed. The gunplay is fairly standard as well, you point and shoot. Guns have a efficiency rating, so the more you use your gun, the more it will deteriorate. This can be fixed by repairing it.\n\nThe RPG elements come in the form of player stats and classes. There's four categories: Stat, Tech, Combat and O/S. The Stat skill comes in the form of your average stats: strength, endurance, psionics, agility and cyber affinity. Tech comes in hacking, repair, modify, maintain and research. Combat deals with standard guns, energy guns, heavy guns and exotic weapons. O/S helps with your body's operating system, and can enhance it with modifications such as being able to run faster, jump higher, increased stats or being able to do other things.\n\nThe classes include Marine, Navy and O.S.A. Agent. Marines are for the people who love to use guns and overall combat. You first learn to use standard weapons, then later learn to use other weapons. The Navy class is for players who want to play with the Tech side of the game. They are better at hacking, repairing items, modifying weapons and things like that. O.S.A. Agents are the most interesting and fun classes to play, but can also be the most challenging. This class uses Psionic Abilities, which gives you this ball that you hold in your hand that can allow you to do many different things, such as shoot energy balls, telekenisis, heal your self automatically or give you stat advantages.\n\nThe graphics in this game still hold up today. The game looks a lot better than any other game that came out around that time, so better than HL1 or Deus Ex. The textures are smooth and nice, and with a few Steam updates, it runs really well. The athmosphere is at first a somewhat familiar one if you're a fan of Deus Ex or Mass Effect. Set in a futuristic space station, it's been overrun by an AI O/S called Xerxes. Pretty much, him and SHODAN (another AI) control the whole ship and there's zombies on it and other monsters on it. They've also programmed the robots to be hostile towards you. The whole ship is very unsettling. The whole ship has a cramped feeling to it, and combined with it being dark a lot of the times does not help it at all. It really provides a very scary athomosphere when playing.\n\nThe sounds in this game are phenominal. If you're a audiophile, you will not be dissapointed by this. The ambient noises are eerie, the voice acting is surprisingly well for it's time and the music is awesome. I'd recommend using a pair of headphones for this game. Hearing the Hybrid zombies in the other room or the hostile mechs marching across the hallway is always frightening.\n\nNow, for some cons about the game.\n\nFirst off, I feel the interface is dated. It's really small, and doesn't upscale good enough on large monitors. It takes a while to get used to and it's hard to use if you don't have great eyesight.\n\nThis game can be pretty challenging even on easy modes, and while this isn't really a con, it does put a lot of new players off, especially people who don't play older games too often.\n\nAlong with being challenging, the controls are a little wonky. They make sense after you get used to them, but that's the thing, you have to get used to them.\n\nThe lack of a journal system can leave you flustered. You have to make sure you pay attention to the lady speaking to you telling you what to do. PDA's help a little bit though.\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is very great, with very few bugs and cons. Challenging, fun and exciting everytime I play it. I recommend this game for people who are just getting into retro gaming. This is a good introduction into what games were like 15+ years ago. Other than that, I also recommend this to players who like horror games, FPS with more depth than your SHOOT DA BAD GUYZ muscleman games and RPG fans.\n\nMy personal score: 9/10 [MUST PLAY]","January 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","1"

Just because I don't like it doesn't the game is objectively bad, it just means that you have to really make sure it's something you'll enjoy before you spend your money.

Long story short this is where BioShock came from. You can trace it back to System Shock, but System shock even in comparison to 2 is a primitive, vastly inferior game.\n\nEssentially SS2 plays out very similarly to BioShock games. You're a dude, thrust into a situation - although System Shock 2 being far heavier on the RPG elements actually gives you a training course and an entire section during which you create your character and choose their path - and things spiral out of control as you, the player, move the story forward and realize you're nothing but a pawn. Setting those nuances aside, SS2 is still very much an FPS first and an RPG second. You will be killing a lot of things, with a lot of different weapons, and a lot of them will probably break too, not to mention be beyond your ability to mod or repair for a significant portion of the game. Fortunately for you, if you're terrible at aiming, the hit boxes for enemies are very large, considering the game is from 1999.\n\nAnd yes, you'll probably get killed by a monkey, and turrets, and radiation.\n\nMany sources will tell you SS2 was a landmark for storytelling and player driven narrative (though HL1 is probably more so) but SS2 basically took the concept of finding plot bits in written form - like in Resident Evil - and converting them to audio. It gives life to the characters, and adds a new layer of immersion when you unravel a story as if you are actually listening to the audio logs or reports or whatever left by these people. Just like BioShock 1, 2, 3, and Dead Space 1, 2, and 3. Other than that, SS2 is definitely one of the first games that screwed with you - a lot.\n\nYou can easily get this game for 1 dollar on Steam and pretty much anywhere else, when the sales are right, and after you do that, there are a wealth of well preserved mods on the internet to try and update the 16 year old graphics to something slightly more pleasant on the eyes. Unfortunately there is no complete remake, and likely never will be, but if you're going to take the leap, you may as well play the original anyway.","January 6, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

This is no Deus Ex.  DX has stealth, conversations, and an engaging story.  SS2 seems to be an old-fashioned shooter that may have story elements to it, but I don't have enough peace from being attacked to listen to any of the logs and understand it.  About the only similarities I see to DX are the graphics and the fact that they both start out relatively hard -- but SS2 is MUCH more difficult to start than DX.  I started at "normal" but immediately had to reduce to the "easy" mode and I still die over and over.  The narrator says things, but I have no idea what she's talking about.  "Go to Storage Room Blah-Blah and get a Something-or-Other."  The storage room isn't marked well on the map, which requires you to tab out to see and then needs a magnifying glass to read it.  If you can see what you want, it's at the far side of a maze and you can't find your way there without constantly re-opening the entire map -- which is usually when you get attacked, so you might as well just roam around and hope you come to the right spot.\n\nYou can easily understand the advances in gaming since this game was high tech.  There is no tutorial; the map is poorly designed; every alarm you set off brings fresh hordes of attackers; when your inventory is full and you pick up something, the game drops something else for you, which you may not notice; and items on the floor may disappear without notice.  Another thing I've noticed is that the guides for this game are written by experts who assume more knowledge than I have.\n\nOne thing I'm not complaining about are the graphics or the sound; there are enough mods out there that these are not a problem for me.  Just the gameplay.  I've had numerous restarts and spent a couple of hours roaming around and trying to figure things out, and it's just not fun, so I'm giving up on it.  Thankfully it was cheap so no great loss there.","April 30","false","1.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","6"

In System Shock 2 it's a much different story. The attack animation is ridiculously dated and there isn't even a mod to improve it.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the aforementioned problems with the weapons and RPG elements were better.\n\nAmmo is way too scarce and powerful weapons like the shotgun and grenade launcher for example require you to level up certain skills before you can even use them even after you've found them. So, for a nice few hours of backtracking and getting enough cyber modules just to use ONE WEAPON(that still may only last you for so long due to scarce ammo), you'll be using the wrench.\n\nIt's a grind fest on the level of unbearable sometimes and God forbid you set of an alarm. You'll be battling hoards and hoards of zombies like enemies until the alarm passes and it's always THE SAME DAMN ZOMBIE. At best he may have a shotgun some times to "mix it up" and there's also the occasional gun turret and kamikaze robot. -_-\n\nYou will be using the wrench A LOT unless you already know ahead of time to enlist with the OSA and build your psi powers more than everything else. Do NOT pick the Marines if you decide to play it anyway because as I said before you will be screwed and doomed to wasting more hours to make progress than what should be necessary.\n\nThis game was made more for PSI players than anything which sucks because I'm the type that uses PSI powers as SUPPORT for things like firearm combat. Not the other way around.\n\nI would have likely enjoyed this game more with a few minor things improved and again I can see why people loved it so much in 1999 but let's be real here...\n\nIt's not 1999 anymore.\n\nI'm overjoyed to know the IP has been picked up and we can expect some new System Shock games for THIS generation but System Shock 2 in this state is not one I can recommend to anyone unless they just like wasting their own time.\n\nWait for System Shock 3 and the remake for this one and the first and if you have yet to play Bioshock play those instead.","January 22","false","1.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

What I found was a game that resembled BioShock in every sense except fun. The combat was bland, the looting was bland, the research system was annoying, and navigating the ship and figuring out where to go next was so hard it caused me to simply stop playing multiple times. In the end, this just makes me wish I were playing BioShock. And any game that makes me wish I were playing another isn't a good game in my book.","April 30","false","16.8"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","0"

I've tried to get used to the unfair, pointlessly difficult AI that you can't hear until you're dead, the turrets that kill you in one shot and basically prevent you from continuing through the game, and the amount of ambiguity of what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go also doesn't help.  Do not go into this expecting a Bioshock game.  I figured I loved the Bioshock series so much I'd give this a shot; I did and I'm sorely disappointed by the results.  I'll wait for SS3 to come out or the HD remaster to drop with improved mechanics and gameplay.  I'm aware the game came out in 1999, so age is sort of working against it, but when your game is being praised as one of the best of its genre, I did expect more.  With that said, I sadly cannot recommend this to anyone who wishes to have any kind of fun playing games.","April 27","false","3.7"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","1"

I played for a few hours with a friend. A mistake I guess, but I probably wouldn't have had the patience playing solo even for that long. I played using NeutralX2's Mod Pack (better visuals).\n\nAudio was pretty basic, albeit monkey screams echoing and hybrids telling you how sorry they are had more of a comical effect rather than a scary one. If only all the remade textures had worked, visually I wouldn't have much to complain considering the age. Everything is just a fistful of polygons, but stuff is at least recognizable most of the time.\n\nThe controls feel sluggish at times. It's hard to describe what it is, everything just feels numb. The wrench, the few weapons I could try, climbing ladders, running, jumping - the last two were perhaps just a problem in the co-op network code, but they were quite horrible. I watched some speedrun videos, and things looked a bit different. The players were flying through the corridors, but that's not what the average player is going to encounter.\n\nI usually dislike the strictly linear nature of modern games. Here things seemed the opposite: you have to go back and forth all the time. The only joy we got from that was when we got lost all the time and laughed about it. The transitions themselves weren't really fun, especially when enemies spawn randomly to the rooms you just cleared. I get it, it's meant to give you this feel that the place is living were you there or not, but it's hard to suspend my disbelief when another service bot just spawned right from nowhere just to annoy the player. In an old school FPS game you are encouraged to explore the non-linear maps, but it's rarely enforced. Here, you reach X just to realize everything was in vain (scripted events), and you have to go back to Y first, and then return to X. It felt mainly tedious.\n\nThe mechanics will take some time to get into. Nowadays I'm not that patient a player as I used to be, and quirks and small things that as a kid might have seemed cool, felt unnecessary and complex in a bad way. E.g, I figure the weapons breaking only after a few shots is to to discourage the player to shoot'em up through everything, but when you have several skills and items to tackle the problem, it just feels dumb. There are psi skills, software upgrades, implants, but they usually seemed to be just buffs like "+5 % health" or something. Things seem very deep, but in the end aren't really, as basically you are shooting stuff either with a psi-amp or weapons, so why not just drop the other. Arguably variability like this adds replay value, and probably you can micromanage yourself a nice "build", but for a casual player, it's not entertaining or interesting. It's more like statistics and numbers than tactical choices. There's also currency you can use to buy stuff from vending machines, you can hack the machines to get discounts etc. Ultimately, it's all again just micromanaging, and the unpolished GUI isn't helping a bit.\n\nThe atmosphere is what everyone mentions as great. The game might have been scary fifteen years ago, but it isn't nowadays. Things felt a bit comical. I don't like survival horror, so it wasn't a good base to begin with, but it was hard for me to imagine suspense here. The audio and visuals have much to do with that, but with the clunky and heavy mechanics it felt hard to get immersed in the world.\n\nWhat makes all this funny is how much I loved BioShock 1 and 2. All the mechanics - psi-skills, hackable vending machines, respawning enemies, audio logs, running back and forth - were there. But most of the time, interface and playability was smooth, there still was a lot of variety for weapon/psi combos. BioShock got things right. I have respect for SS2 in pioneering things, but the truth is, it just isn't enjoyable anymore.\n\nOn a side note, as some have already mentioned: the Linux version is actually wrapped with Wine, and there is no multiplayer option by default. You have to do some manual work to get it there, and even then you probably encounter some network issues as I did. Eventually I just played using Windows. It might be worth your time to install OpenAL in Windows to get echo effects - it's included in the Linux/Wine version by default, but not in Windows, but I read that you can get it to work.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to check out a relic that introduced some new mechanics to the world, do try SS2. You might actually enjoy it. For casual gamers, you're probably a decade late for this ride.","July 27, 2015","false","5.6"," 21 of 59 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","21","59","0","9"

I wanted to play this outside of finding mods that might fix this, but as is it's just so unenjoyable. "W" moves forward, "A" turns your camera to the left, "D" turns your camera to the right, and "S" toggles crouch. Peeking around corners is just undoable as you might as well be a backing up truck trying to get back behind cover. Also this makes combat way more difficult than it needs to be. This is my main gripe with the game, so if you can find a way around that you'd probably enjoy it\n- I'm increasingly surprised at how difficult the combat is. There's no nice ramp up or settling valley with difficulty, it's just "did you get there first and swing your wrench? no? alright you're probably dead".\n\nI can understand why this game has influenced as much as it has.

What could I possibly say that wouldn't have me under fire by fanboys automatically. My job here isn't to tell people what they want to hear but to tell them what they need to hear. System shcok 2 has all the components of being fun, but it's not. I'm reminded of playing doom half the time, not because of the constant action, which btw action sucks in this game, but I'm talking about that parts in doom that were tedious and you had to look up several walkthroughs on youtube to see what to do! Literally half of this time I spend walking around trying to find out where to go. I usually love games like this. I loved all the bioshock series and people tell me all the time about how bioshock 1 was a clone of this, so i figured it would be good, but no. This game is tedious, you search too much, you use your wrench half the time, you'll be walking around wondering WHERE THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO GO! half the time, not to mention that guns break after literally 10 or 20 shots! I guess after all the money the military paid for their ships they had a low budget so they bought wal mart brand shot guns and pistols? which by the way do jack ♥♥♥♥ against most enemies. You know you have a ♥♥♥♥ed up game when you'd rather use your wrench againgst other enemies rather than your actual firearms because the guns are that ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Honestly guys, this game didn't age life fine wine, it aged like milk. And if you don't want a metaphorical swig of old chunky milk in your mouth, then I suggest you not buy the game. Watch a lets play if you really want a good experience.\n\nYou know, it kind of sucks because I had so much fun the first couple of hours. Literally, I searched for 75% of the time wondering wtf to do. It's god awful. Idk if I'll ever finish the game. Maybe in a couple of years when I literally have nothing else to do I will try and play this painfully tedious first person "shooter," (or i guess I should say swinger, since you only use your wrench 80% of the dang time!) If you want to play an oldschool game, or play an easy to run FPS buy ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR 2000 on steam. You'll find yourself with your thumb up your ♥♥♥ significantly less often than this game. Now I'm off the look at walkthroughs for the game and If the game is any different once I finish it, I'll make sure to come back and say so. *slaps forehead in disappointment.*\n\nLet the angry fanboying commence.\n\nOkay, so after plugging many, many hours into this darn game. I have to say that My stance has changed to a 3/10. This is my honest review, even for a guy that was totally optimistic about this game, it's design is just way too ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

The blend of FPS-RPG elements seems haphazard at best and very clunky in implementation. The gameplay doesn't help either. The Dark Engine clearly wasn't meant for head-on combat (as exhibited by the Thief games where combat is mostly avoided) but unfortunately the player is forced to combat enemies all throughout the game. The pacing isn't very good either; I spent four hours just trying to get off the first floor I started on. The story is okay in most areas and I did like the concept of The Many, but the ending literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to no end because it ruined an otherwise satisfying sequence and basically turned the entire game into one big joke. However, the voice acting for characters, the textures, and the sound design was top notch, just like the first game. Now comes the points on why this isn't a very good game and some points on it being good:\n\n- Gameplay is clunky and very bad in some areas (guns constantly breaking in the beginning and the middle section of the game, movement is awful and feels very awkward compared to other games at the time, melee combat is also literally the worst thing I have ever experienced in a game like this; I fail to understand how you could be standing in front of someone and miss with a melee weapon, etc.)\n- Skills are often split into seperate skills for absolutely no reason other than to overly-complicate things (Why is maintenance and repair seperate skills? Doesn't it take some maintenance knowledge to be able to repair something and vice versa?)\n- Story is alright mostly, but the ending is quite possibly the worst videogame ending I have experienced in quite a long time. (The comedic relief was completely out of place and ruined the whole ending sequence turning the game almost into one big joke.)\n- Pacing isn't very good. I spent four to five hours just trying to get off the medical / science (and engineering) deck to be able to explore the rest of the damn ship. After finally getting off those floors, the game started to pick up again but falls flat once again once I reached the Command deck and boarded the Rickenbacker. The Many's flesh home also suffers from being terribly boring and monotonous (kinda like Half-Life's Xen section) and also slightly ridiculous at the same time!\n\nThere are some good things about this game however:\n\n- The voice acting is excellent for the time and is top notch just like the voice acting from the first game was.\n\n- The textures are great and the level design is alright, but somewhat monotonous as I managed to get lost a few times.\n\n- The sound design is excellent, nothing more to say.\n\nAll in all, this isn't really that great of a game, and I don't understand how this overshadows the first game so much. The first game is superior in literally every way. I might have missed a few things so I might come back and edit this review later.","June 13, 2015","false","23.6"," 8 of 36 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","8","36","0","0"

The gameplay is ok, but it does a VERY poor job explaining things as I got stuck at a door because I didn't have high enough hacking level. Why? How do I get more? When you chose what branch you were going to, I wanted a little more information and walked down the corridor. Suddenly I chose my path.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/recommended/238210/","derungrund","Der Ungrund","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/","388 products in account","One of those classics that hasn't aged well at all.  As demonstrated in the Thief games, the dark engine can pull off stealth beautifully, however it falters when it comes to straight up combat (it's floaty, awkward, and really doesn't work as an FPS engine).  Thief 2 wisely avoided combat entirely for this reason, but unfortunately too much of "System Shock 2" is just straight up combat. The early portions of the game when you are just getting your bearings and exploring the ship level by level are entertaining enough, but as the game progresses it turns into a much more tedious corridor shooter.  Ammo is scarce, enemies are repetitive and, even worse, they repeatedly respawn. Like Thief, the levels are massive and thus easy to get lost in, but unlike Thief they are not all that varied or well designed.  And as the game progresses too much of your time is spent back tracking over areas you've already covered on tedious object hunts which usually don't amount to much more than cleverly disguised "find the red, blue, green, etc, etc keys to advance" style of game play that used to be 1990s FPS' stock and trade.\n\nThere are some brilliant ideas here (it has tons of atmosphere, the scarcity of ammo really creates a palpable sense of desperation and fear at times, and Shodan is one of the most memorable and influential video game villains ever for reasons that would probably be too spoilery to go into), but for all its innovation and clever ideas unfortunately the core game play just isn't that fun.","August 5, 2013","false","20.8"," 33 of 100 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","33","100","0","5"

I suppose it's not fair to give it an earnest review now that the game is so old, but I'm going to do it anyway.\n\nI sort of knew what I was getting into with this one, but I was bored and curious and it was on sale.  Playing this game was sort of like going back and watching Blade Runner for the first time because you heard everyone talking about what an inspiration it was to later science fiction movies.  You could see all of the influences System Shock had on the genre.  You could see the amorphous, rudimentary blobs of creation that would eventually evolve into enjoyable gameplay mechanics in later titles.  You can also see the cancerous growths of an unforgiving and largely cryptic leveling system that punishes you later on if you didn't happen to level the way the game never told you you should.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is a relic of an earlier era.  I would not argue with people who claim that the game was revolutionary for its time, or that it was the progenitor of many of the modern games that I love -- assuredly these assertions are true.  However, I am forced to ask simply, "Is the game still fun to play?", and sadly I must answer "No."  Ignoring the draconian advancement system, the game feels sluggish and poorly optimized, and the interface is a complicated counter-intuitive mess.  Also, I hate to say it, but the dated graphics seriously hurt the ambiance the game attempts to create.  I've been told that the game can be made less unpleasant through the use of mods, but I simply can't be bothered.  The game is old.  It was probably good for its time, but it's old now.  Let us give it the respect it deserves and allow it to fade into a pleasant, nostalgia-laced cocoon of obscurity.","June 3, 2013","false","1.7"," 42 of 123 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","42","123","0","4"

I'm a huge gamer - and I especially love old PC games, challenging games, obtuse games.  But I just can't quite dig System Shock 2.  I tried a playthough doing the PSI route, and it was so insanely hard that I thought I was missing something, or not understanding the rules of the game.  I tried again going the Military route, which was much better, but after a few hours of gameplay I think I've had enough.\nI love challenging gameplay - I'm a decent gamer.  But there are design issues as far as I'm concerned.  You can save/load anytime you like - but the game is so brutally unforgiving (there are many times you literally can't do anything about just constantly losing health, from radioation or toxins, etc) that it becomes a "save, load, save, load" kind of experience.  You can use anti-toxin hypos, but because of the design, its almost better just to reload and try again, because hypos are so ridiculusly rare.  There are places you can regenerate in the game, which seem redundant with the save/load always available.  I invest in maintenence, but there are no repair tools.... like, for HOURS of gameplay.  I invest in repair, but I'm not even sure how I'm supposed to repair things.  I invest in energy weapons, but after so many saves and loads I seem to have left an energy weapon somewhere, so that's out, as I won't see another one for another hour probably.  It's one nonstop annoyance after another, this game, as far as gameplay mechanics.\nThe atmosphere is great, sure.... the story and audio logs are amazing.  I can't think of any other game I was more excited to actually listen to the audio logs you find throughout the world.  The creepy factor is superb. I love the arcade, old-school style challenge.  But the whole ability to save/load at any time sort of undermines the experience.... it's almost just as good to use your wrench and just keep doing save/loads until you get lucky and get through a series of hallways.  I invested in research, and the chemicals I needed were in a DIFFERENT chemical storage room, far away.  Really?  How many dang chemicals are in this game?  Sheesh.  Is it worth it?\nIt seems to suffer from nerds-designing-games.  It's incessantly complex, but it feels arbitrary.\nI'm genuinely confused at the good press and reviews.  I think I actually hate this game on a gameplay level.  I think only if you designed it, you would know how to play it.\nThis is just my opinion - but I've played games for decades, I'm a fan of tough games from Another World to Dark Souls, Doom to VVVVVV.  But this just feels kind of sloppy and "save, die, load, save, die, load, save, die."\nI'm sure people will say, you don't know how to play it, or something.... but I actually feel like I don't.  I tried a few times... it went better the second playthrough, but.... I think I'm over it..... just my opinion.","December 8, 2014","false","0.7"," 10 of 47 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","10","47","0","6"

Now, this is by no means a bad game- there is a ton of story to unravel and there is a wide variety of playing style. Now, since I have the binary "Yes or no" options, I'm going to have to say "no" to if I would recommend it or not for these reasons (These are why I personally cannot recommend it I should say):\n\n1- The graphics, although great for their time, are dated and are hard to follow\n2- The game requires a great deal of focus and attention to get the most out of it\n3- Things aren't really explained, security cameras are bad apparently and it's not discussed why that is until its too late\n4- Weapons degrade with use and repairing them is costly, this might be the "survival horror" aspect, but the game feels more like a "stealth shooter" than a horror game.\n\nI wasn't able to play the game as much as I wish I could. I ended up restarting my game multiple times trying to figure out what play style worked for me and really didn't find anything that suited me. Don't let my review stop you from trying it for yourself, but just be prepared that this is an older game and one of the origional "immersive horror" games... it would be like playing the origional Resident Evil game after having played Resident Evil 6- It just has a completely different feel that stands solely on the nastolgia factor.","August 26, 2014","false","0.8"," 15 of 60 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","15","60","0","0"

I was running in circles and didn't even notice it until several minutes later.\n\nOn top of that the game is full of death rooms filled with radiation and security cannons that kill you as soon as you enter, which completely discourages any exploration. The voice acting range from passable to god-awful and the graphics haven't aged well at all.\n\nI do not recommend System Shock 2.

Before anyone accuses me of being a troll, I want to state that I am 40 years old, and played this game when it came out. If some subhuman millenials weren't stupid enough to think that it's some sort of "forgotten gem," people would still recognize it for what it is: Crap. When this game came out, every reviewer and audience member hated it. The only reason people like this is because they are stupid hipster kids who can't listen to an old person's wisdom and understand that maybe if someone is twice your age they may have learned a thing or two. So if you are anything like me, avoid this game like the plague.","July 2, 2015","false","92.1"," 2 of 41 people (5%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","5","2","41","7","4"

(unlike some games *Bioshock awkwardly shuffles out of the room*)\n+great voice acting\n+amazing soundtrack (seriously, get it)\n\n+/- quite a bit more complex than Bioshock, it is not like Steel Battalion (1, not the crappy kinect one), but it is a far cry from most modern titles\n\n-really bad first half hour\n-you know how I said VIRTUALLY no cutscenes? there are a couple.... and they are HORRIBLE, the main character looks like an origami swan\n\nthere is no reason not to buy this game now, it is one of my favorite games form the 90's (I was going to say my favorite, but I am afraid Doom beats it to that), and I am sure that anybody reading this will love it too.\n\n(plus, it is on sale now)","October 26, 2013","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But now, everywhere I turn I see these annoying "System Shock 2" fanboys preaching me its praise. They keep saying how its "overall a better game" with more "horror" elements. Yeah whatever. They dont get the hint that I'll only play a game because I want to. God, theyre like a thorn in my brain...it hurts...it ♥♥♥♥ing hurts...\n\n---------------------------\n\nNIHILUSION 10.JAN.15\nre: first go\n\nOkay, so I gave it a shot. You know what? I gotta say, it isnt half bad. This game keeps you preoccupied with many things such as managing inventory, stats, nanites, modules, but all of it easily handled; its never complicated. And the funny thing is that it never feels like busy work. Sometimes in Bioshock games I felt like I was simply going from point A to point B, but every step in System Shock 2 carries a purpose...yes...a greater purpose. Yes. I feel...content. I mean, I guess its good, and I can see why SS2 fanboys like it, but Im not really sold on it's SPLENDOR...maybe I'll just play it for another hour and call it quits.\n\n_________________\n\nNIHILUSION 11.JAN.15\nre: vision\n\nYes...yes! I can see it now! How could I have been...SO BLIND. It bathes me in its elegance like the cascading sunlight.\nI'm am part of something...I am an organ of the MANY. Come, and welcome the embrace....................\n\n_________________\n\nMANY 12.JAN.15\nre: awesome game\n\nBioshock games? You should get System Shock 2. Its overall a better game and has more horror elements.\n\n\n","January 12, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the best games ever made. System Shock 2 and Thief: The Dark Project terrified me when they first came out. I still hate spiders and zombies. If you like shooters, play this game. If you like games like "Deus Ex", then play this game. If you like retro-creepy-you wont sleep for a week-games, then play this game. System Shock 2 is creepy, the soundtrack is superb, there are VERY funny moments (both intentional, and unintentional) throughout the story. Yes, it is somewhat linear, but that is to be expected from the age of this game. No, it isn't open-ended or open-world, which is NOT problematic. This game is incredibly immersive, challenging, fun, and is the original idea behind many modern games.\n\nPros: Gameplay, soundtrack, immersion, creativity, story, voice-acting, terrifying.\nCons: Dated graphics...*sigh* rats. Oh, and that's about it. This game still stands on its own.","January 15, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
