I'd consider this to be in the "travel defence" genre, a bit like Space Run.\n\nPro:\n\n-Nice borderlands style graphics.\n-Good music which really ties in well with the atmosphere of the game.\n-Literally, a rail shooter.  But in a good way.\n-Each level can be re-played for more cash and better upgrades.\n-Without giving anything away, some of the upgrades feel really great.\n-Difficulty seems spot on, with a mild curve, but the game is understandable and easy to learn quickly.\n-Developers are friendly and actively encourage feedback.\n\nCon:\n-Voice acting is a little shaky and unbelievable.  Should have got some real Southerners! The main voice (in the intro and trailer) is really quiet due to the "droney" Southern style accent and is hard to hear.\n-Can get stuck on levels if you do too well - killed a boss within seconds and it made the level uncompletable. (Devs looking into this)\n-Although the graphics are nice, some things don't appear until you've already gone past them.  This means you're costantly looking backwards, which seems odd. It's not that big of a deal, but some missions ask you to destroy scenery which may or may not spawn by the time you've gone  past it.  (Found out that this is due to the graphics settings - just turn it up if you can.)\n-Other niggly bugs, like the launcher has an "empty" button which doesn't mean anything.

What feels initially like the smooth gameplay concept of Star Fox, mixed with the accuracy capabilities of a FPS and the challenge of managing health and damage, is an enjoyable experience. With the ability to jump right in and play, this game requires little learning curve and allows (requires, really) you to jump right into the fray.\n\nIt looks pretty, with graphics that remind me much of Borderlands art style, which is not a detrement at all and fits quite well with the Western layout. And at a cost of $5, this game is a steal. Hopefully the developer continues to develop and releases additional courses, with possibly even a tool to create your own courses and share them online.","May 31","true","1.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

In fact, short of the limited nature of the game style itself I really haven't found much wrong with it. Maybe it's a tad too difficult? (But then when a game gets to that stage these days, I generally save my time somewhat by cheating a little.. /cough)\n\nMore than once, I was put in mind of the ground levels of Starfox 64.

Had to quit to main menu and restart my game to progress\n- On one particular level (Redoubt Pass) if you kill the last generator in the middle before you enter the middle circle, it would lock you in the switch up part.

The game is $5. The cheapest McDonalds meal you can buy is $5.69. Have you ever eaten a Mc Donald's meal for 7-10 hours? More like 10 minutes. Have you ever played a pinball game for 10 hours with $5? Have you ever done ANYTHING for 10 hours of entertainment for $5? They are basically charging you .50/hr to play this game.\n\nThe art style is very, VERY good. You are treated to authentic train maps and rotating items in the game during loading screens (like in Skyrim). The voice acting is really cute and amusing, and MAN the music. The music is absolutely phenomenal, it's BETTER than the music in most professionally released games.\n\nThe only cons I would say is that there isn't more of it, more levels, multiplayer, VR, etc, but if your biggest Con is that there isn't more of the game (and what I said about $5) then how can you complain. These guys are indie developers and built this passion project from the ground up. Mad respect.\n\nThis game has extraordinarily fun and engaging gameplay, an original concept (MOVING tower defense) and an intuitive interface so that you don't need instructions on how to do anything in the game, it all is designed to be played without a complicated tutorial or manual.\n\nLET THE TUMBLEWEED ROLL OUT!","June 3","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Hell I think its worth more then that honestly. If you like Rail Shooters, well obviously... this is what you are looking for. Difficulty flows well and each upgrade feels worth it. You can replay levels for more $$$ with a few more challenges and some levels even have more then 1 path to take.\n\nAfter upgrading to multiple train cars I do wish there was multiplayer where you and your friends each control one Car and battle for survival and scores.\n\nReally great concept and I hope the developer continues to make more awesome games!","May 31","true","4.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay mechanics all run very smooth, the upgrade system hits the 'just right' mark where you can replay missions for contracts (essentially challenge missions) to fully upgrade as you do along, or you can stick with the normal upgrade pace.

The graphics are very borderlands-esque. It it a neat concept and depending on how far the Dev's wanted to go with it, it could become a pretty big game. I will list some pros and cons\n\nPros\n-Reasonably priced. For only $5 it well worth what you get\n-Great graphics, engaging environment.\n-Unique gameplay\n-Fun, levels aren't too long and they do a good job of mixing things up, and integrating new enemies.\n-Story line actually isnt half bad. World is believable in a sort of post apocaliptic meets steam punk-ish world.\n\nCons\n-Short, but again I believe long enough to be worth $5 or more\n-Some levels aren't the best, or just have weird quirks that are annoying. Most are good though. Only 2 come to mind\n-Voice acting is pretty bad.\n-You need to destroy cacti for a few of the challenges, but their spawning is really weird.\n-After you unlock all four train cars and get some guns on them, at normal dificulty, the game kind of plays itself. You really only need to pay attention for switching tracks, lowering bridhes, and clearing road blocks. Not much to worry about after a certain point.\n\nI enjoyed it. It would be fun to be able to customize the look of your train, switch which car you are controlling, add more stuff to the engine, etc. There is tons of potential in this game.\n\nTo the devs: Cheers!

The train upgrading is fun, missions make each level more interesting, and the style is cool.\n\nOn the negative side, I\'d say the boss battles are too easy, but I did also make sure to be fully upgraded before each one.\n\nAlso wanted to add that the linux support is a big plus. I probably wouldn't have bought the game without it.","June 1","true","6.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The upgrade system and contracts add a lot of replayability to each level and keep it from getting stale. It\'s cheap and fun enough that I can easily overlook some of the smaller flaws and minor bugs of the game.","May 31","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You'll get about a dollar an hour out of it. Genuinely entertaining.\n\nCons:\n-Voice acting. Can be laughably bad sometimes.\n-Story is meh\n-Some game breaking bugs. Last boss would disappear mid fight or become invincible. Had to fight last boss 4 times before he would die.\n-No way to skip in game cutscenes.\n-NO WAY TO SWITCH BETWEEN TURRETS ON CARS BESIDES SELLING AND REBUYING TURRETS. EXTREMELY ANNOYING. PLEASE MAKE AN OPTION TO BUY MORE TURRETS FOR EACH CAR AND SWITCH BETWEEN THEM.\n-No way to just turn of turrets for cars besides selling them. They get in the way of a lot of side missions.\n\nStill fun enough to 100%","May 31","true","5.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Upgrades are neat and make levels replay-able to earn achievements. The voices are funny and I can only imagine how fun they would have been to script/record. Really cool. Nice job devs. Will def be putting more time into this. Kudos.","May 31","true","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
