You use this mask to enter God State to manipulate the area. By moving the earth, controlling the sun and moon, and making it rain, you solve puzzles to progress. I almost always enjoy puzzles in most games, so this game was no different.\n\nThere were a couple areas that I died repeatedly, so I did find that the platforming got a bit harder towards the end, but I admit that I am not the greatest at platformers to begin with. Fortunately, the game is very forgiving. All the crystals you earned before you died still remain collected, so you don’t have to find them again. Also, with a fair amount of checkpoints throughout the game, and infinite lives, the game is friendly to people looking for a more casual experience.\n\nPros:colourful, cute, and visually appealing animation style - everything looks great\na nice mix of puzzles and platforming with good gameplay mechanics\nmap showing all the checkpoints, and where you haven’t been to yet\nmap also allows for teleportation to certain checkpoints that you've already activated\nawesome narrative - it was done extremely well, and it did an amazing job telling the story\ngood story: it conveyed a strong, positive message that some people might have forgotten...\nCons:puzzles were too easy throughout the game\nThe Beggar’s Ride took me about 3-3.5 hours to complete. Normally, I don’t pay much attention to mobile games, so I had never heard of this game until its Steam release, but I am glad that the developers ported this over to PC. I enjoyed the game, and am completely satisfied with the purchase. If you're a fan of casual puzzle platformers with story, it’s a solid buy.","May 6","true","4.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

At first I thought it would be a poor choice as a large part of this game is casual platforming, but I was rather surprised that it actually works quite well and helps slow the pacing a bit so you can enjoy the environment.\n+ Great soundtrack\n\n- The one downside is the cutscenes are incredibly short, and I wish the narrator who has a great voice could have read through more of the dialogue you encounter throughout the level which would have enhanced the experience a fair bit.","May 28","true","9.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Well it isn't, it has a pretty intresting bigger backstory to it that I won't spoil.\nThe music is pretty great and provides a nice calm atmosphere to the game, while the gameplay itself is AWSD to move and a right click to jump kind of control.\nThe gameplay mostly involves solving puzzles that may sometimes be completely easy and sometimes might take a couple of tries, it may not be the easiest puzzle game but it kinda is easy. The graphics are cool and whenever you switch between your beggar self and god-like self the world around you changes in a cool way.\n\nHowever, I don't know if it's just me but the manuvering in the game and going through levels to unlock different powers is kinda hard, like rn I'm kinda stuck cuz I don't know where to unlock my last power. The level manuvering is kinda messed up because you don't know if you're sometimes going ahead of where you should be or if you're on track. That's probably the only negative thing I've noticed...\n\nI would recommend you get it but it's not rly a must-buy, it's still a pretty great game and I'd give it a 7/10.\nIf the game is on sale (like it is the time I'm writing the review) then it would be pretty great to grab it.\nHope I helped anyone with this review...","May 5","true","3.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Not optimized as they should have been (and this take its toll on the game's enjoyability)\n- Some puzzles are just absurd\n- Lacking full controller support (seriously, this is a must for this genre)\n\nOverall it's a fun and relaxing game.\nRecommended.","May 8","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
