Wildlife Park 2 Fantasy is a small EP that is worth the $1 price (if your a fan of this game). this pack contains two types of animals, dragons and unicorns. This is where the pack becomes a little bit disapointing where there is simply a lack of other fantastical creatures such as; ogres, trolls, imps and other creatures based around mythology. Overall this pack will please fans of this game and delivers a new idea that is never before seen in zoo simulators.","July 22, 2014","true","1.6"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"
