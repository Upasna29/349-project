Henry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/munkelschmunkel/","81 products in account","Wobbly Jungle - Review\nGameplay:\nWhen I first looked at this game I didn't expect much from it. Looked like a very basic, simple platformer. And whilst it isn't revolutionizing the genre, it certainly did a very good job at offering challenging, long lasting and varying gameplay.\nThe controls are very basic - move and jump - with the addition of double jumps and wall jumps.\nWhilst the game seemed to be quite simple at the first few levels, I soon was faced with a repertory of crazy and challenging\ntwists - forcing me to act both fast, and cleverly.\nThe game offers 60 levels, which come with lots of hours of diverse adventure.\nThe only real problem I encountered whilst ingame, was the camera management - often you don't see where you need to jump and you're just forced to leap and hope for the best.\nThus, the gameplay overall is solid, what is missing are some other things:\nThe menus are very confusing and lack some features (for instance the ability to manage the volume!), and the game comes\nwith only one track, which repeats every 3 minutes.\nFurthermore, great potential was given up, by leaving out the ability to create own levels and share those.\n\nPros:\n+High variety in gameplay\n+A lot of content\n+Challenging\n+Simple controls\n\nCons:\n-Poor menu management\n-Soundtrack consists of one track\n\nConclusion:\nAlltogether I can praise this game for both its length and challenge and can only recommend it.\n8.5/10\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 26","true","5.4"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","1"

And I doubted I'll manage to make a quick run with it.\nBoy, I was right. The game is quite challenging just from the start, and I really don't know how many hours of pain and rage-quitting it will bring to people, but I'm sure there will be plenty.\n\nI'm still not that deep into to name Wobbly Jungle a rival for the Super Meat Boy... But surely, it is much, so much more killing than any of the Dark Souls, self-proclaimed "hard games".\n\nSo. The game is tough and challenging, yet gratifying. I strongly recommend to use a joystick, though, as your keyboard arrows and space button aren't that precise and durable, as the game demanding.\n\nThe only noticeable downside of the game (unless you're a sissy which afraid of the real challenge) - is music. Sure, the looped track sounds nice... for a first hour or so. Yet, there are absolutely no means to tune the volume in the game. It really, really lacking such option. Jeez, even the most most basic flash games have a "mute" button at least! I really hope the devs will do something about it, as the frustration is growing with every hour I'm spending on the same level, with the same track - without the possibility to do something about it!\n\nSo far I can recommend the game for the little sessions (about 10-30 minutes long) for the players who are fit to break hard platformer games. This little piggy holds much we're all so fond of, from the times of the first Mario game.\n\nMy mark 7.1/10.\nPS: I got this game for the free, for that I'd like to thank my friend Petar!","April 21","true","5.3"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/437090/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Forget the cute graphics and presentation. Sourena Game Studio’s second game on Steam, Wobbly Jungle, is one of the most difficult precision platformers that I have ever played. And that’s a wonderful thing. The studio based in Iran previously developed Legends of Persia (not to be mistaken with Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia franchise). I have to admit that I was almost going to quit the game without having completed the second level as it wasn’t immediately clear where I had to go after reaching a certain point in the level. Thankfully the skill that was being taught in that level, the double jump, held the answer to my prayer and I was able to continue on and complete the level.\n\nI unfortunately do not have very much to write about the game because of just how difficult the game is. This is a game that I want to dedicate some time to so that I can write a better review. I find the graphical presentation to be more than suitable except when you’re left guessing at what is off screen which resulted in most of my deaths. I would argue that this is unfair but that’s my personal opinion. The music sounds good but unfortunately becomes quite repetitive. This is a little bit of a disappointment because had the soundtrack been more varied it would have been a very good soundtrack. The controls are a little on the floaty side but not to the point where it is a detriment to the game. If you spend enough time with the game they will become comfortable.\n\nAlthough I haven’t gotten very far into the game as of yet I am definitely leaning on the positive side. There’s just the right amount of charm to keep you engaged with the game thanks to good, not great, production values and factoring the sub-$5 price tag.","May 2","true","2.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

In this game you have same goal like in other same games, just pass you current level. Here you will find a lot of different levels and at all level different enemies. Sometimes you can kill enemies, but better always avoid them. This game is very challenging and require you best skills to pass it.Also you will find here a very cute and nice world. The game controls are enough good with gamepad, but with keyboard i think even better to not start this game, because its bring for you only frustration. The music also good, especially if you like a electronic style music.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ cute world\n+ nice electronic music\n+ steam achievements\n+ challenging\n+ a lot of various levels\n\n- no steam cards\n- hard control with keyboard\n\nThis game is enough good, have nice cute world, a lot of various levels and nice music. If you like platformers games and your are looking for a challenging gameplay this game for you.","April 23","true","2.2"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

Seems simple but it is not! I really like platform games and levels are very complicated. The enemies are also cute, I always expect bad guys, zombies, etc but not there are many cute things in this game.\n\nI played with the keyboard but I think this is a game for a joystick, due the quantity of jumpings needed to complete each level. Also, sometimes you cannot see anything but the little islands in the sky be afraid of kill tour character and restart level. Is not easy, I promise.\n\nThere are good things ahead, try to complete the levels and you'll see new tasks and difficulties.\n\nArt concept is cute and the music very nice, so I really enjoy playing this game.\n\nThanks, devs!\n\n\n\n","May 12","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
