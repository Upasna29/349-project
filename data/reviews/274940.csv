"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/274940/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nI approach a dark cave with my team of divers, illuminated by our flashlights and some pulsing, bioluminescent jellyfish. S.T.E.V.E., our submersible bank robber, is looting a safe nestled in the wall of the cave. We're all two weeks from retirement and this is our last haul. Captain Stubbs is safely leading this expedition from his boat (he lost his arm in a bizarre arm wrestling accident, presumably). It's at that moment I hear rapid tapping on glass and muffled cries – shark! We scan every direction and realize just how dark this little cave is... you can't see more than a foot in front of your face. Jacques Cousteau (unrelated) is greedily ransacking the ocean floor for bits of treasure when two tons of predatory evolution slams into his torso, shredding him in front of us. I fire my harpoon and the shark goes belly up, but so has Cousteau. We sigh collectively – lightning doesn't strike twice. It's at that moment that two divers disappear, yanked into the dark abyss; the bits of treasure they were carrying tumble to the floor of the cave from a cloud of blood. Not only does lightning strike twice, but it's apparently learning to work in tandem.\n\n(Translated from Sharkenese:)\n\nThe intruders from above have returned, pillaging our underwater home, peeing in it, and leaving behind uncut six pack rings. They're entering our secret underwater clubhouse that Jerry spent months, *months* filling with bioluminescent jellies – do you know how difficult it is corral jellyfish? They have no brains! We swim around them silently, keeping to the shadows. These humans are well-armed and fidgety. Jerry spots one stealing his conquistador treasure (Jerry had a lot of hobbies) and his black eyes, like a doll's eyes, can only see red. He charges and snaps his jaws around the meatsack, shaking him mercilessly. In his fury he failed to notice the human with the primed harpoon gun (he was two weeks away from shark retirement). Seymour and I won't be so reckless.\n\nDepth is great fun; some of the best multiplayer I've experienced in 2014. It's a simple enough concept – you're either Team Tooth or Opposable Thumb. Humans have to gather treasure from the ocean floor and bring it to S.T.E.V.E. – money you make will allow you to purchase guns and items. After S.T.E.V.E. loots enough safes you'll surface with the booty... assuming you live long enough. The sharks, meanwhile, have to stop you by doing what sharks do best. As they tear humans apart, destroy their environment, and slam into S.T.E.V.E., they'll gain points to unlock perks that will better help them hunt. When the humans surface or either side runs out of lives, the game is over.\n\nThis kind of asymmetrical gameplay means you're going to be playing two different games – one a pulse-pounding underwater horror shooting gallery, the other a twisted game of cat and mouse in which you're the cat. The balance is some of the best I've seen in a multiplayer game. Neither side is overpowered, assuming you're a team player. Humans need to stick together, avoid open water, and purchase items like mines and flares to even the odds. Sharks need to work together, hitting the group as a unified force and snatching any isolated stragglers. Sharks can also alter the environment, slamming into walls and ceilings to open up more directions to attack from.\n\nOn the graphics front this is one good looking indie title. Humans killed by sharks bob in the water, horrifically gored, and sharks gunned down loll and drift. The underwater worlds are beautiful and varied, from gloomy waters sullied by an oil rig disaster to clear blue tropical seas. And it's all populated with marine life and awesome set pieces (WWII wreckage, decaying whale corpses). The controls are some of the tightest I've experienced for an underwater themed game. Historically swimming in video games... is less than stellar. I was more than a little apprehensive about spending an entire game in the big blue, but divers and sharks alike feel completely natural. Divers move sleekly, and sharks sleeklier-er. And the utilization of the mouse movement for shaking a victim to death? Brilliant.\n\nBut things aren't all lollipops and rainbows, no. I do have a few criticisms, namely lasting appeal. At the moment there's only a few levels, three human skins, one kind of shark (Great White), and one kind of game mode. And while the bots are some of the best I've seen for a multiplayer game, this is the kind of game that benefits from you having some good friends to play online with. Hopefully there will be some updates and DLC releases adding those aforementioned features.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with Depth. It's surprisingly frightening to play as a diver, swirling around, peering into the gloom, knowing at any moment a shark can materialize and lunge. And it's equally exhilarating to prowl around as a shark, plotting your next move. If you're getting tired of the same old zombie/medieval/heist multiplayer, I'd recommend you grab a few friends and take a dip. The water's just fine.","November 3, 2014","true","20.5"," 962 of 1,071 people (90%) found this review helpful 199 people found this review funny","90","962","1","199","31"

If you're like me, and you're COMPLETELY sick of the overused military FPS genre - then this game would be worth a shot. The movement and combat style has so much depth (See what i did there? So clever :D) and playing with friends is hilarious.\n\nYou can play as a shark - huge Great Whites (slow but take a beating), a Mako (Super fast, but weaker), or a Tiger Shark (kind of a mix of the two) and you can adapt throughout the game to best hunt the players you're after.\n\nEqually, if you decide to play as a human (whether pub matches or with friends), you are nonstop upgrading yourself as well. I've found that they reward me for kills, assists, collecting gold, etc. and you can use all of it to buy better weapons (everything from a tiny little pistol [looks like a .22] and a spearfishing pistol all the way up to explosive harpoons, assault rifles, and mines to blow sharks to pieces.\n\nI absolutely love it - (and it's built on the Unreal Engine - so it's relatively solid and has good FPS regardless of the system.) --- I've had no problems whatsoever on my AMD 8-Core, my brother's Nvidia Quad-Core, or my dad's mid-range laptop.\n\nIf anyone's interested in looking into it more, here's some gameplay footage (recorded by myself) that kind of showcase what the game is "in a nutshell".\n\nGameplay as a shark (Megalodon Mode):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jbSXnOerwY\n\n\n\nGameplay as a Diver (Blood & Gold Mode):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbSNsUD7bc\n\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 9/10. - It's got refreshing gameplay and controls (like the movement), and every match feels different (as the maps have plenty of corridors and sharks/humans can adapt to each others' playstyle). The only thing keeping the game from being a complete 10/10 is the fact that they need a bit more content, and a few minor fixes.\n\nNOTE: They have released the DepthED (editor), allowing players to work on their own maps, models, and mods for the game! I can imagine this game being my G.O.T.Y. very soon!\n\nCome get eaten (er... survive!) with me!","December 26, 2014","true","42.0"," 445 of 486 people (92%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","92","445","486","78","0"

Playing as divers sees you take on mutliple different sharks in often claustrophobic and submerged corridors or in dark, wide open spaces where your reflexes are the only thing that will keep you alive. As a shark you have one goal and one goal only, tear every last diver to shreds and prevent them from completing their objective.\n\nThe game currently has two game modes and I'll briefly explain them now:\n\nFirst up we have 'Blood and Gold'. In 'Blood and Gold' four human divers must protect an underwater robot called S.T.E.V.E while he travels around the map opening old safes to find loot. With the objective to kill the divers and stop S.T.E.V.E we have two sharks, killing humans rewards the sharks with skill points which can be used to unlock skills making the sharks more powerful. In 'Blood and Gold' both teams have 30 respawn tickets, the sharks win if the humans use all 30 respawn tickets and the humans win if the sharks lose all 30 respawn tickets or they safely get S.T.E.V.E back to the dive boat with all the loot. This game mode focuses on close encounters in cramped rooms.\n\nThe second game mode which was recently released in a free content update is called 'Megaladon Hunt'. In 'Megalodon Hunt' five divers take on the Megalodon, a far more powerful version of the Great White. The divers are tasked with killing the Megalodon and whoever gets the kill then becomes the Megalodon, divers can get better weapons by collecting treasure along the sea floor. The objective of the Megalodon is to stay alive and kill divers but with no health regeneration in this game mode this player must also hunt seals as they dart around the map which provide the Megalodon with more health. This game mode focuses on map-wide combat as the divers chase down the powerful shark.\n\n+Great graphics\n+Fantastically gory, if you manage to escape the shark after being in its jaws you're gonna be a bit torn up, literally\n+Following the content update on April 2nd there are now four playable sharks\n+A wide variety of weapons and consumables\n+The controls are fantastic, divers feel agile and graceful in the water and sharks really feel like they have some weight to them\n+Quite a few maps now that there have been some new ones released\n+The divers hear a heartbeat which increases in volume as the sharks get closer to warn them of impending danger but this also makes this very tense for the divers as they could be attacked any second\n+Sharks take divers in their jaw and must shake the mouse to kill them which provides the diver in question (using a knife) and the other divers a few seconds to kill the shark before they become chum\n+Very dark environments which make it hard for divers to see where sharks are coming from\n+The skills for sharks to unlock are fantastic and really add to the gameplay\n+The Devs have already posted two DLC-worthy content updates since the game's release adding more content\n+Has an editor mode and the Devs are fully supportive of modding in the game\n+Performs well\n+If you can't find anyone to play with you can practice against bots\n\n-Sharks are considerably more fun to play as, I found this led to me and my friends arguing a lot about who should play as the shark next\n-Unless you have friends to play with (as I do) you're gonna spend a lot of time waiting in lobbies as there aren't many people playing this and it relies entirely on matchmaking, i.e. there's no server browser\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nThis is easily one of the best multiplayer experiences available on Steam with great asymmetrical gameplay and all the gore you could hope for this is well worth full price as I paid for it.\n\nEl K.","April 2, 2015","true","6.4"," 394 of 437 people (90%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","90","394","437","27","14"

Game is hard.and slightly barebones\nThis could be one of those MP games you invest a lot of time in. OR just another one to "OOOH" at for a few hours before you lose interest like always. That's a broad statement, I say it because this game has endless replayability without a ton of variety or incentive to invest so much time.  It will take a little bit to unlock everything but once youve used the first couple guns/upgrades and played the one single popular gamemode, you've experienced almost everything to offer.\nThere arent any skins or nameplates, nothing for those mindless unlocks we all crave... However, that isnt anything to gripe about. in-fact, there's nearly nothing to complain about with this game. It just works, and its fun.\n\nIt's a very unique and smooth experience. It has endless replayability because its an online MP of freaking sharks vs. divers deathmatch. Thats enough to give it a try imo.\n\nBeing a shark feels almost like playing L4D as a special zombie in vs mode. And well, being a diver feels like youre going to need therapy if you ever want to go to the ocean again. It's incredibly fun on both sides, and a lot more enjoyable than id thought on the divers side.\n-Although there isnt a huge arsenal at your disposal and you will often play the same loadout through different matches, each gun feels unique and can be upgraded with poison, bleed, tracker, ect. The equipment(similarly limited and unique) also makes up for it.\n-There are about 9 or so maps and they all look really good and are fun to explore. A lot of detail was put into this games scenery. You wont often be off exploring, but you will be looking for treasure more and more as you get better, so it takes a while before a map loses its luster.\n\nEven tho the game is about sharks vs divers, the game mode is about treasure-hunting and it doesnt feel like that most of the time. There is no voice acting, or any events happening, the environment is all static and nothing really changes. All of the treasure you find is the same crap all painted gold, scattered around aimlessly. i just wish it was more..eventful\n\nABOUT THE GAME:\nThere is pretty much only 1 game mode.. there is also another neglected one nobody plays\n-each team has a set amount of tickets(spawns/lives).\n-[4 divers] scour the map for loose treasure, whilest following a bot that travels around the map occasionally stopping to crack a safe.  You gather loot to gain money to buy/upgrade weapons/equipment.\n-[2 sharks] must hassle the divers as much as possible, trying to kill enough of them before time runs out and they end their treasure-hunt. You kill for points to upgrade your shark with perks.\n\nid give it 7/10 - good panic attack sim\nplaying with friends would make this twice as fun.","June 28, 2015","true","10.8"," 350 of 391 people (90%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","90","350","391","45","10"

Depth allows you to pick one of two sides in a never-ending battle between Man and Shark.\n\nAs a human, you have a few options to use to help you and your 3 team mates. You and your friends must find creative ways to outsmart 2 blood-lusted Sharks. You have an array of weapons at your disposal from guns, net-guns, spear-guns, grenade launchers. You also have tools like sonar blasters, speeders, and more. On top of your mission to ensure your team's survival and exterminate the sharks who attack you, you must escort a sub-aquatic robot companion named S.T.E.V.E from one end of the level to the other. Fortunately, there is tons of cover. Unfortunately, the 2 sharks you face are strong enough to break the environment.\n\nAs a Shark, you will swim swiftly through the waters and kill as many divers as you can. Using swift speed, powerful jaws and sheer cunning stealth of the animal instinct you are powerful and fast enough to hunt the divers one by one. You will get to choose from a variety of sharks, from the nimble Mako to the almighty king of the sea, the Great White and anything in between - each having their own unique abilities to match their dangerous personality! You will see humans no matter where they are but they cannot see you so that already gives you the advantage early on. However, can 2 sharks constantly keep 4 divers from collecting treasure to upgrade weapons and tools? Or will you destroy their robot companion to stop them dead in their tracks?\n\nDepth goes by matches/rounds. It's in the same catagory as Evolve, Natural Selection 2 or Primal Carnage: Extinction but it's much more balanced considering it only lets 6 players in a given game. The servers are stable and the game is quality.\n\nPros Devs are constantly updating this game, handling with care\nExtremely well balanced multiplayer game\nController Support\nPractice mode with bots for when you don't have internet connection\nCons Veterens may intimidate newcomers\nFrom time to time you may see a hacker\nMatchmaking may take a bit depending on what time you play\nFinal Thoughts:\nOver 30 hours in and I found myself having alot of fun with this one personally, as a shark lover I have to recommend this game. This game does the horrific feeling of sharks, justice. Try it and you'll be hooked. It's truly a one of a kind experience, you can find tons of team-based Humans vs Monsters games but this is the only team-based Humans vs Shark game out there.

There is only one way to survive; surprise and cunning.\nWait for that diver to separate himself a bit from the group. Sense him as he approaches the edge to take a peek and sweep him away from the safety of his peers as you tear him to bits. Get that greedy diver that separates himself to fill his pockets with gold, never to be seen again.\nBut now they are all guarding a cavern, protecting the remote sub S.T.E.V.E as it opens a safe. To enter is to get harpooned. Whilst your team mate shark breaks the walls and all attention focuses on those walls you approach from behind and snag a diver out of there. Now their team rushes to save him, firing everything they've got at you, but it is too late and their attention-shift allowed your shark companion to snag yet another diver from behind again. Hide, ambush, coordinate attacks so that all the divers see is chaos and bloody death.\n\nBut what is it like if you are the diver? It is like the movie Jaws only worse; there are 2 of them. Starting with only a basic weapon means you the only way to survive is to stick together and protect your fellow divers from becoming a meal. Experience the thrill of hearing your heart beat indicating a nearby shark presence. Try to figure out where in the darkness of the ocean the shark will come from only to have him drag a friend out of there from behind without you even noticing. Feel the anxiousness of knowing you have to cross an open part of water, trying to make out shapes as far as you can see with your flashlight only to have a shark appear from the depths and take you far away as you attempt to stab him before your inevitable demise.\nYou need money to buy better weapons so you have to resort to the scavenging of gold you find spread around the place. Get enough money and this whole situation could potentially turn itself around. Place mines around suspected shark entrances, or perhaps just as important, shark exits. The shark will try to drag a diver away only to blow itself up on a mine. Boys placed around the place will alert you of nearby sharks so you can aim that harpoon in that direction and get yourself some shark. Careful not to miss as the long reload could well mean seeing your limbless friend drifting in the water next to you. Be smart about it: sharks can only expend their energy in short bursts. When they rush in to grab and tear your fellow diver to bits he will be tired. If you have not managed to save your fellow diver, avenge him, chase that tired shark before he recovers and get yourself some fin soup!\n\nLater towards the dive, divers become more dangerous as they are able to afford good equipment. The sharks however, have unlocked perks with the kills they got giving them abilities that will make them much more dangerous. Abilites like increasing the range at which they can sense you, detect mines, even what type of weapon you are carrying! Gain health from eating you, ignore pain at expense of stamina, etc.\n\nI prefer games that have low HUD elements, glowing things on my screen, etc. Would prefer a bit less of it but in the fast paced action that can happen once ambushed it is useful to direct attention to certain elements.\n\nPROBLEMS?\nAny ISSUES? Yes. At the moment there are issues regarding multiplayer gameplay. Trying to join a match is a royal pain. Six people have to join the lobby and by that time people will realise that the host is actually AFK and not starting the match...this happens a lot. A lot of waiting. Host yourself, sure. Wait for it to fill, convince people not to quit. Now you can actually host it. Problem? Sometimes instead of "creating server" it will say "connecting to server..." and never actually load or do anything. You have to leave your lobby, rejoin and have someone else try again. Created server? Second potential problem: most players will gain status "connected" whilst one or 2 will have status "conecting..." and they will never connect. After 1m30s game kicks to lobby.\nDoes this happen all the time? No. Does it happen regularly? quite (when I host, I only get the first problem). Just gotta be a bit patient, sure they will patch this. The hosting UI needs to be improved too because the way it's set out is non-intuitive. Instead of "host" or "start match/server" you have to click "Find Match" to host. Deal breaker? No. Way. I have expanded my steam-friends list quite a bit so we can quickly populate a lobby and enjoy the game together over and over again as every game feels so different depending on the shark's attack plan.\n\nVERDICT: The game is fun. You enjoy it with your team. It's intense. Love it, I can deal with it's issues. It'd be nice if they fixed them but I am still happy I can enjoy this gem of a game.","November 4, 2014","true","26.3"," 155 of 166 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","155","166","6","2"

So relatively short games, packed with action.\n\nDivers collect treasure to earn money to get better guns and consumables, protect steve jobs, and kill or be killed by sharks.\n\nSharks learn abilitys and are able to select those abilities based on how many kills they get, 1 kill = 1 point, a skill like longer stamina on spawn = 2 points or 2 kills, etc.\n\nYou unlock new weapons for divers and learn new abilities for sharks with the experience you get from playing the game. It is account leveling and they also keep track of leaderboards for all sorts of different things.\n\nThe game is simple and elegant in it's own right, and can keep me entertained on a nightly basis. Highly addicting gameplay.\n\nOnly con for me is the optimization, I have a pretty meh computer and even with everything on low I usually get a whopping 14 frames or so.

The core game mode, Blood and Gold, is a great gametype that will be 99% of the matches you play. The other two, Megalodon Hunt and Hide and Seek, are gametypes better suited for playing with a full lobby of friends in a private match. The game receives content updates roughly every month, and over the course of the game's history it has gotten a large amount of free content, such as new sharks, shark evolutions, weapons, weapon upgrades, and maps. The only DLC this game has is cosmetic skins, which while pleasant to look at, do not alter the in-game stats of any gun or shark equipped with it. Also the game looks and sounds incredibly nice, which coupled with how vital sound is to the game, makes for a very immersive experience.\n\nThis is not a game that is incredibly easy to get good at, as the game has no skill compression, so you will need to dedicate time to the game to fully understand its mechanics. I would say you gain about 70-80% of your ability and game knowledge in the first 72 hours, obviously itll be less for some and more for others. However, you will need to dedicate far more time than that to reach the level of where the elite divers and sharks are right now, which is where the game becomes most fun.\n\nThat does bring me to this games biggest fault. The size of this game's community is not very large, so it is likely as a new diver that you will be matched against very high level or potentially leaderboard players in your first couple of games. Nobody likes being overwhelmed like that early on in their experience of the game. Due to their knowledge of game mechanics that a new player will not understand, it will seem like they are cheating/hacking. They aren't. In my entire playtime I have yet to encounter a cheater, and there are players with far more playtime that still have yet to find one.\n\nOverall I would give Depth a 9/10. Everything in the game is done very well, and I have enjoyed all the time I have spent in-game. The only thing holding this game back is the population size. With a larger population size I think this game could really flourish, as it would allow new players to have a more enjoyable experience early on, leading them to play more and longer.\n\nTL:DR - Buy this game because sharks","September 28, 2015","true","778.1"," 111 of 121 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","111","121","11","0"

I don't want to hurt feelings here)\n\nWell, there is a bot named S.T.E.V.E. (which opens safes and things like that) and four divers that have to gather treasures, load them onto STEVE and protect him while doing his job.\nAnd then there are two sharks which shall prevent that divers noble scheme.\nLike in CS and the likes, killing people (or sharks) results in getting money to buy weapons or "points" to buy skills as a shark.\n\nSounds simple? Hell, yes it is! One or two rounds as a diver or a shark and you've got more than the basics.\n\nThe good:\nI have not had such a dense and thrilling atmosphere in a game for a long time (in fact i don't even remember one at all). And i'm a pretty f...ed up dude who is thrilled by nearly nothing and yawns at every "horror"-game or movie ever made.\nBalance! Even though the sharks seem to be overpowered (hence there are 2 vs 4), they aren't really that overpowered. Without proper planning you're toast. And a good player one-hits every shark (if he sees him coming) with a harpoon.\nSharks can resplenish lost health by brutally murdering....seals. Poor little guys. It's for the greater good!\nYou've found a safe hiding place with only two entries? Perfect! Well until she sharks start breaking the wall behind you. What was a nice room with 2 entries the minute before has now big holes left, right, below, above, before and behind you...\nNice integration into Steam with a nice lobby. Not just one of the usual "Let's sell our crap on steam but not care for steam's possiblities!".\nYou kill divers (when having them in your mouth) by rapidly shaking your mouse. Nice idea, totally adds to immersion/predatory feeling.\nFOV-Slider. Yes! The thing most AAA-Titles don't even consider including!\nNon-exclusive Fullscreen option AKA borderless windowed. Thanks!\nThe graphic-options are, what is seen VERY rarely, "clueless-proof". Every option has an ammount of arrows indicting how much it will sacrifice performance in favor of eye candy and vice versa. Every non-nerd will say THANKS! for that!\nNice skills for the sharks like better sensing, healing, sharp fins etc.\nNice gadgets for divers like mines, sonar detectors and similar.\nThe theme diver vs shark is solved pretty decent IMHO. The heartbeating-sound that starts to indicate that a shark is nearby is a breath-stopper. And the diver that stupidly spreads from his team for that piece of loot not knowing you've sensed him and prepare a fast attack...priceless!\n\nThe bad:\nPerformance is quite decent, but sh*t hits the fan when enabling the most atmospheric option that is "misc. sealife". Fish, snakes, everything that lives underwater. Very sad because that really adds A LOT to the atmosphere but drains too much performance.\nEveryone seems to favour becoming a shark. But maybe only because it's something "new". But not the game's fault anyway. Just mentioned...\nThere could be some optimisations to the UI. Like loadouts for divers and such things.\n\nThe ugly:\nNo. Nothing. Really.\ntl;dr:\nIt's a damn atmospheric, intense, thrilling and (for some) probably even horrifying cooperative 2 versus 4.\nThe moment as a diver when the heart-pounding sounds start (which indicate that a shark is nearing your position) is as priceless as when your human prey willingly brings itself into a dumb position and you're prepping your rush-attack of which it is totally oblivious until it's too late.\n\nIf you like the concept of the hyped "Evolve", you should consider this one instead (or until).\nIn it's core it's better in all aspects (set aside the HUGE difference in manpower and budget!). And while monster-hunting in Evolve is fun too, there is never a constant feel of danger or even fear. You never feel like you're prey (Neither as hunters nor as the monster).\nHere you are and you'll feel it. And this feeling won't stop, never giving you more than a second to relax :-)\n\nDo i recommend this? YES! But buy something like "Disney's Winnie The Poo" or "World of Diving" too, to calm down after a session of "Depth" ,-)]","November 3, 2014","true","11.9"," 147 of 175 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","147","175","12","38"

Unfortunately for them they must contend with 2 additional players who control Sharks, who's prime and sole motivation is to eat and kill the divers before they can complete their quest for loot. As a diver the game takes a lot more of a survival horror route, with the player starting out with a basic pistol and survival knife as their only defense, as they progress through a map they can collect treasure lying on the sea bed as well as allow their robotic companion S.T.E.V.E to open undersea vaults for a surplus of cash which can be used for additional equipment and weaponry; meanwhile Sharks can develop terrifying evolutions by devouring divers whole; allowing them abilities like tougher skin, razor blade like fins for hurting divers with a touch and regenerative health. As a Diver the game really feeds off of atmosphere, the sound direction is tense and nerve-wrecking with Shark proximity to players denoted by an increasing heartbeat. There's truly nothing more terrifying than seeing a Shark dart by and then hearing the screams of your companions in the distance as they fall to the creatures jaws.\n\nLuckily Divers have a range of equipment to turn the tides on the fiendish fish from more powerful guns, to equipment like flares to illuminate the dark path, Sonar buoys to detect Sharks in a close radius and finally sea mines for an explosive punch in any Sharks gills. As a Shark however players have the ability to ram S.T.E.V.E to cause temporary malfunction, this causes a loss of gold for the Diver players and a cool down period in S.T.E.V.E's movements. S.T.E.V.E Isn't the only destructible object in Depth however, even parts of the environment can be destroyed to create new passageways and area's to maneuver around, this adds some strategic play to the map design allowing the Sharks greater tactics and maneuverability; although from time to time maps suffer from easy to exploit camping spots, S.T.E.V.E at least keeps things interesting by consistently moving to new spots around the map, forcing Divers to move and protect him at all times. One truly appreciated Shark mechanic is the use of the mouse to simulate the contorting and thrashing of the Sharks jaws, when biting a Diver players can shake the mouse left and right to deal more damage to their prey, it's little things like this that really help immerse players, simulating a Sharks reaction helps really put you into the role more and while it can be a little disorienting, overall I find it a little quirk that (pardon the pun) adds more depth to playing as the Shark!\n\nWhile the game is great to play, (and better to play with friends) it does suffer from a lack of content, 5 maps and one game mode which operates on an arcady, wipe the other team out of their respawn tickets system. It's a nice play style, but the game has the premise and set up for so much more, I have no doubt that with continued support with varying game-modes and maps this could become a truly unique experience as it stands however at a price of around £18 its a bit of a steep asking price, however the game is well built with no major bugs or glitches that hinder play. Despite this though the game is a real blast to play, as a Diver the thrill comes in surviving and outwitting your superior opponents, nothing is more tense than reaching the home stretch goal, with the exit and a gold laden S.T.E.V.E in sight, making one desperate last stand to survive, as the Sharks come through the vastness of the infinite ocean; or likewise the satisfying feeling of picking off your opponents one by one as the Shark! It's moments like this that really make Depth stand out amongst the crowd it's just a shame there weren't more opportunities for it to flex it's fin's.\n\nStill, we really do need a bigger boat...","November 16, 2014","true","16.5"," 92 of 102 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","92","102","6","4"

The objective for the divers is to secure treasure found at the bottom of the sea. To do this, S.T.E.V.E. -- a small and slow robot -- must drill into safes lost in wreckage. The sharks' job is to stop the divers by chewing their limbs off. Divers can swim incredibly fast using a dash/dodge movement, while sharks also have this movement abilty, and it's significantly faster than the diver's ability. All loot/weapons/abilities gathered in a round will be erased after that round is finished. Very much like Counter Strike's currency/gear system. Each team has reinforcement points, when your team's points deplete you can no longer respawn. If you do die and respawn as a diver, you'll be able to spawn on STEVE itself. Sharks will always spawn at the same initial position.  This usually means that the divers are always near STEVE. If STEVE is destroyed then it's game over. That's pretty much the entire game.\n\nOverall the game is good, but that's the problem I have with it - it could have been something truly great with gametypes that took advantage of the unique theme of the game because as it stands now... this is sorta just Call of Duty with sharks. I feel this is a wasted opportunity because the theme of the game is very unique, and deserves a gamemode that utilizes the terrifying aspects of sharks, but right now it's really just a game about depleting the opposing team's tickets.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is a huge lack of "horror". There is nothing frightening about the sharks; in fact, this game makes skarks less frightening (this is coming from someone who's so afraid of sharks I won't even go into the water, AND I LIVE ON THE BEACH).\n\nUnfortunately, there is very little depth in the game Depth, but know that despite this initial impression the future of Depth is looking bright with more content promised by the developers - including mod support.\n\n\n\nPlease understand that I'm torn between recommending this game or not (I've been waiting for this game for almost 5 years so I'm a little biased). If you think the theme alone is not worth your money, then you might want to avoid this game.","November 3, 2014","true","6.1"," 165 of 208 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","165","208","6","5"

This often leads to tense or outright hilarious situations depending on yours and you’re team8s ability to stay in control, the diver team might hunker down in a shipwreck, stewing mines, sonar’s and flairs everywhere to fight of an attack that doesn’t happen... yet as soon as they move between two wrecks or caves half the team could be pulled away and eaten before they get to safety, this often leads to a complete breakdown in team-play as getting into the next wreck alive is more important than covering you’re team and ohh boy are big open spaces scary in the deep...\n\nSharks:\nThe initiative is in your corner, you choose how the game will play out and who will be eaten. With the array of evolution upgrades depending on how many divers you swallow you can either become faster, more intuitive or stronger. Going for the divers straight out of their Shark Cave or after they have been lulled into a false sense of security and just like the divers, team play can be essential between two sharks. Either by attacking at the same time from two different places (Smashing through a hull) or simply playing distraction while you’re fellow shark pulls out a diver whose team have their backs to him/her.\n\nThere are a surprising amount of counters and abilities in the game that really allow players to supplement each others, one diver might tag a shark with a harpoon, the other could catch him with a net thus leaving the two reaming divers to riddle him with darts while he tries to get out.\n\nOr as shark, you might choose to take the hammerhead ability which allows you to disable the little robot that accompanies the divers (S.T.E.V.E) by ramming him in the open, this leaves the divers vulnerable between cover and in the deep. Which in turn can complete change the game as the desperately try to defend him they are snatched away one at the time in the best JAWS like fashion.\n","November 4, 2014","true","22.4"," 88 of 98 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","88","98","5","7"

The game primarily uses matchmaking to assemble teams, once ready the game will also ramdomly decide who's a shark, and who's a diver. From there the divers rely on teamwork to defend against the sharks while collecting treasure. The shark's primary role is to stop the divers from making it out alive, while avoiding bombs, bullets and other gadgets at the divers disposal. If you're as scared of sharks (in real life anyway) as i am, this game feeds off that fear by placing you in dark, murky water with low visibility putting you on constant alert as to where the sharks will strike from. On the flipside, if you happen to to be a shark using the internet, this game's got some scary human weapons as well. During internet play i never encountered any lag problems or performance issues, but the one main concern i had with Depth is that it seriously requires teams to work together, a single person screwing around can cost the entire team the match, and since teams are chosen at random, you never know what you're getting. It's still a very fun game if you can get a good team going though.\n\n[THE GOOD]\n+ Promotes teamwork\n+ Creepy atmosphere\n+ Gameplay is very fun\n+ Offline practice against bots\n+ JAWS anyone?\n\n[THE BAD]\n- Relies heavily on matchmaking\n- Not recommended for run & gun gamers\n- Can be very frustrating at times\n- Not a large variety of maps or modes\n- Sometimes finding a match took a while\n\n[THE UGLY]\nDumb players/trolls who either repeatedly split up and get picked off even though you constantly warn them to stay together, or players who wander around the map instead of helping.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNsrK6P9QvI\n\n[BOTTOM LINE]\nIt's a very fun game, though i personally think it should carry a $15 price tag instead of $20 due to a lack of modes or alternative content. A very fun game with friends, and a very fun game if you can get a good team going.\n\nRecommended 8/10","November 20, 2014","true","3.8"," 115 of 150 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","115","150","8","0"

The atmosphere is fantastic, there's a decent variety in different weapons as a diver, and different "evolutions" as a shark. These different weapons/evolutions give the player the opportunity to play their own way and create their own playstyles. Right now, the game is very pollished and a lot of fun, both with random players and with friends.\n\nIt's an asymmetric action game which means that the two opposing teams consist of different types of gameplay, where the Shark players (2 players pr. game) are playing an action brawler and the divers (4 pr. game) is playing a first person shooter.\n\nThere are currently 5 maps but the developer is planning on releasing more, and also releasing an editor, giving the community the chance to make their own maps. Since the game just got released (November 3rd, 2014) there hasn't been much yet in the form of new content, but the dev will be rolling out new sharks, new diver equipment, new maps, the editor and even support for player run dedicated servers. I've played a variety of asymmetric action-focused games like Natural Selection 1/2 and I gotta say that Depth is the most balanced one yet. There will always be those that complain because they're having a hard time, but I've found the game to be extremely well-balanced.\n\nGraphics are decent and the atmosphere is brilliant. At times you'll feel like your playing an Alien game, you hear your heartbeat racing, you can hear a shark trying to bust through the roof and another shark on the other side of the wall that you have your back against! At times, this game is very tense and exhilarating!\n\nIf you're an experienced FPS gamer you'll find yourself right at home as the diver, where the role of the shark might need some practice to get right. The learning curve is not all that steep and you'll quickly find youself killing sharks and eating divers in no time ;-) Easy to learn, hard to master.\n\nThe community of the game is fantastic!! Everyone is very excited for the game and seem more than willing to help newcomers. I was having some issues in my first 2 games, and I wrote "Damn this game is hard" in the chat when the match was over. This other guy wrote "add me" and invited me to play with him and his friend. We played for about 3 hours and I got gradually better. Turns out the guy who asked me to add him was number 3 on the diver Leaderboard (He is now number 1). I was having some trouble with my Nvidia GPU so I had some frame rate issues, and this guy just sent me a link to a support page on the forums, and 2 minutes later the game was running smoothly at 50-60 fps on medium (my PC isn't much of a tank :D)\n\n\nOverall, the game is an 8/10. Well polished, pretty, atmospheric and exciting, however it's not filled with too much content yet, however I fully expect this to change with time. Really great game as it is and I can't wait to play it a lot more! ;)","November 8, 2014","true","31.9"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","53","58","0","6"

The whites have learned everything beyond biological rule and have managed to reverse away from my beacon.   Realizing these are no ordinary whites I attempt to warn my fellow swimmers who have been healed by poseidon himself strictly to finish our job of grabbing 40 quid's worth of crowns off the sea floor.  My warning falls on deaf ears as I once again see the collage complimented by screaming bubbles.

You can pick up other treasure laying around the place to supplement this income and get better unlocks faster. Sharks kill divers, get points, and pick evolutions to enhance thier latent abilities. This sets up the game for a frantic and tense experience: Divers are constantly tempted to go pick up treasure, get greedy, and set themselves up to be mauled. A heartbeat indicates how close the sharks are. Sharks need to examine the map and find ways in and out of an area. While it may be tempting to zip in and out to get a diver, you run the risk of getting tore up by their buddies since you don't instantly kill upon contact. It can take about a second to kill a diver and that's plenty to finish you off, especially end game when the divers have automatic weapons and harpoons. Once you do get a kill, however, you'll always end up taking damage. Hunt down a seal and eat it to regain health.\n\nSo, in a nut shell:\n\nDivers stick together and keep alert of your surroundings.\n\nSharks look for exits so you can drive in, grab a diver, and power your way out to kill them. Also, bust down as many walls as you can.\n\nIn conclusion, this game let me cut a diver in half with my pectoral fin, 11/10.","November 4, 2014","true","32.3"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","58","70","2","0"

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but it has a fatal flaw. The matchmaking puts people who are playing their first match against those who have 4000 under their belt. Get it on sale, both for the price and because you will play with other newbies. It's a much better experience.\n\nPros: Dependence on teamwork is key. If you enjoy L4D or the like odds are you will have a fun time with Depth.\nLots of variety in loadout options. This goes for the shark and diver teams. Both have a wide variety of perks/weapons that they can utilize and are to a degree adaptable to the opponent's loadout.\nGameplay variety too. The shark gameplay is a 3rd person beatemup type deal. The diver is a more traditional FPS with a heavy emphasis on sound and subtle motion detection.\nGreat atmosphere\nIt's just fun. Depth is a solid game in most aspects. I've played it for a while now and I still quite enjoy it.\n\nCons:\nSnowballing effect is pretty disgusting sometimes. This especially goes for the sharks. If you let them kill you a ton at the beginning you've basically already lost.\nSmall player base. I really hope this game survives, but the player base is currently quite small.\nOne game mode. Technically there's more but you only ever play one. It is a very good one, but this may turn off some people.\nLet me get to the big one. Wildly varying matchmaking quality. Sometimes it pits evenly skilled players against each other, but often one team is leagues beyond the other in terms of skill. Generally the shark team is better, as many higher level players lean towards shark. I sort of know why they do this as the player base is not that big, but something needs to be done about this issue. Badly. I can just BARELY recommend getting this game because the issue is so bad. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen poor level 1s fighting level 100s, inevitably getting annihilated, and quitting the game. And then the 100s blame them. Like, no? There NEEDS to be a system in place that puts the newbs and pros in different categories for matches. It will help the game survive. It doesn't help that many of the 100s are jerks either.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun game that I do recommend. It's probably not worth the full $25, but I'd give it a shot if it goes on sale. Just prepare for frustration when its horrible matchmaking system gives you the shaft many a time.","April 20","true","149.2"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","43","47","3","2"

I've been playing ever since it came out, in fact before it even came out; Pre ordered and got to play in the Beta!\n\nThe game is simple when it comes down to it, there are 4 divers and 2 sharks that are matched in the water together.  The divers try to get treasure in order to get money and buy new and better weapons as the match goes on, better defending themselves as they try to survive.  You can even lay down mines and watch a great white shark blow up into a million pieces in front of you!\n\nAs for playing as sharks, you can choose from 6 different sharks, all with different very unique and optomized skills.  The six being the Great White, Hammerhead, Thresher, Mako, Bull, and Tiger shark.  Your mission is simple; Eat all the divers and relent your force upon them!\n\nThere is also a second game mode called Megalodon Hunt, which I find doesn't get as much love as it should.  Everyone's a diver except for one (5 v 1), the one being the Megalodon.  When you kill the megalodon, you become it and you try to kill as many divers as you can.  Rince and repeat!  Lots of fun with friends.\n\nThis game does include skins, but it's not a cash grab, you definitely don't need them as you can play as all the playable sharks anyways.  I will admit they're beautiful though, and definitely worth it to pick them up when the game is on sale!\n\nAll in all, I give the game an honest 10/10, sure there isn't much to do as it's the same thing over and over, but it's so much fun that it never gets old (At least for me.)  The gameplay is fluent and feels right, and is just arcadey enough to keep you satisfied.\n\nThe game is lots of fun to play and seems to never get tiring, but the best part in my experience is the community.  Of course there are a few rotten people every now and then, but I constantly and consistently meet new people in every match whom are so much fun to talk to and make the game even greater.  Depth honestly has the best community out of all other games in my opinion, everyone seems to be very open minded and nice!\n\nAll in all, I highly reccomend this game; everything is amazing about it!\n","February 10","true","125.5"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","34","37","0","2"

This game is by far my favorite Steam purchase. Buying it is like buying two separate games, because the feel of playing as a diver is completely different than the feel of playing as a shark. I'm going to review both sides, but first a little overview.\n\nDepth's goal for the divers is to collect all the treasure and escape. The sharks' goal is not to allow that. Both teams can win by depleting the other team's respawn tickets and killing the last enemies, however the divers also win if S.T.E.V.E. makes it out. S.T.E.V.E. is a remote controlled submersible that goes to four safes on the map, spends time opening each safe and after opening all four, heads back to the ship. The sharks can slow him down by ramming him, causing him to reboot, but they cannot destroy him (from what I have seen). Anyways, S.T.E.V.E. starts opening safes very far from the shark spawn point, but moves closer with each safe, meaning that the shark attacks will get more frequent. He also distrubutes gold from every safe he opens amongst the team, allowing even the struggling members to upgrade their arsenal. Now, on to the divers.\n\nBeing a diver is terrifying early, and just scary later. Early on you start with enough money for a small pistol and a few consumables. The pistol does not feel effective, and every time the heartbeat that signals a sharks approach sounds off, there is a real fear. You frantically look from dark spot to dark spot, searching for that torpedo with teeth you know is out there. Every noise causes you to jitter as you grab some golden treasure and fling it at S.T.E.V.E. You hear a thump, and smoke comes from the ceiling. As you look up, a shark swoops from one of the windows and you are enveloped in a gaping maw, stabbing wildly as the shark before perishing. You spawn again, with a better weapon, and follow S.T.E.V.E. to the next safe. En route, a diver in front of you is snatched by a grey blur. You hear him scream and gurgle as you lose sight of both of them, firing off a tracer round that hits and tracks the shark for a few moments. An overzealous teammate chases, firing for revenge when the other two thousand pound slams into him from behind. You don't bother looking, and quickly search for more gold while you wait for that sickening crunch. You lay traps for the fishy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s this time. Finding a corner, you wait. An explosion sounds in the hallway, and pieces of shark flesh fill it. You smile, then twitch and fire a spear and impale the shark that just snatched a teammate. He climbs from the sharks maw and looks at you. You think it's a look of gratitude, and then some teeth promptly tear your legs off. S.T.E.V.E. advances. The sharks are attacking faster now. But you have guns. S.T.E.V.E. is ready to begin the long voyage back to the boat, so you begin. Sonar buoys alert you to one shark's presence. Your team quickly turns and fills it with lead and steel, but the other shark swoops in and snags an ally, slamming into S.T.E.V.E. as he goes. You protect him while he reboots, losing another diver but trading for a shark. Respawns are gone on both sides. You and three-AIEIIIIEEEEE- two divers against two fearsome beasts. You make it back to the cage and turn around just in time to see another ally eaten. Your last ally places a sea mine and stands out in the open. A blur darts in and then the ocean is mixed with shark and human bits. S.T.E.V.E. stops. Rocked by a mass of fins and teeth. The shark knows you can't leave without your gold. You have to leave the cage. You venture out. The heartbeat is there, but the ocean is so dark. You see a shadow. Turn, fire the harpoon! It's not enough. You're in the mouth, stabbing wildly again and again and again.. and again. The creature died with you in it's mouth. Extricating yourself, you head skyward. All the treasure. Yours.\n\nNow, fun story non-withstanding, the game is pretty balanced. As I mentioned earlier, you start off with very little cash. Even without doing much treasure collecting, you have enough for a better arsenal after one safe. The sharks are very strong, but if your team is playing and moving tactically, the sharks will have few opportunities for clean attacks. That's the key though. Even mispositioning for an instant can lead to a free death. If you swim through an attack coridor where you can be grabbed and quickly pulled out of the room, it can cost you. It often does. Later on, after about the third safe, the game becomes more about who sees the other one first. And the sharks can see in the dark. It gets hard, but some quick reactions can make or break your team. Now, the tickets are balanced almost perfectly so both sides are running low by the time the trek back starts. In my 40 or so games only 3 or 4 have ended before the last safe. The trek to the boat is one of the most fun experiences in each map. The divers have to swim in open water, so the sharks really get a feeding frenzy, but the divers have weapons that kill quicker than the sharks can now. It's a real rush, and an excellent way to end each match. However, the game does slightly favor the sharks overall, and understandably so. They are the ones in their element. This actually makes it more rewarding to win as a diver though, as it makes each victory feel like a real accomplishment. Now, as a shark..\n\n\n\nYou hear their heartbeats. You know where these invaders are. There is nowhere they can hide. There is nowhere you cannot go. You will destroy them and their mechanized companion. You sense three of them crowded in one cave. But a fourth is out on the reef, looking for something. He is looking for the wrong thing. There is a shriek that you shake to silence. You sustained minor knife injuries. A seal makes another squeak as you swallow it and feel revitalized. The divers think they are safe together. They are wrong. Another shark surges into the room, lunging for them. You follow and repeat. Devouring one, another is halfway down your gullet when you are overwhelmed. They will pay. You are stronger this time. Faster. They have moved to a more open area. You lunge again, but this time some infernal thing entangles you. Spears pierce you and quickly end you. You will be sneakier this time. A diver swims over a trench. Crunch. Another moves to set a trap in a doorway. It dispappears down your throat with him, unarmed. Your ally bursts through a wall into their safe room, the smoke obscuring you both. But not the intruders. They are tasty now. You sense there are not many allies left. But the intruders are leaving. None will live to tell this tale. You can feel them quake. A flick of your tail and you disappear into the darkness with a screamer. Your ally is not as quick. His teeth slice through a diver seconds before a harpoon enters his skull. There are two divers. That is not enough. You pick up speed and snatch one right in front of the other to inflict maximum fear. You feel a sting. You are wounded. The creature is close to escaping. There are no seals. You will not allow them to live. Moving in the darkness you wait. He moves towards his safety cage. He is almost inside and then you hit him. He stabs you once. Twice. Then the resistance is gone. You have destroyed the intruders. They will not come again.\n\nThe sharks are excellent. You feel powerful when playing a shark. From the very beginning, you feel in control. There are excellent perks to help ensure that as the divers get stronger, you do too. However, unlike the divers, you don't passively gain any evolution points. You earn them through slaughter or you get nothing. I mentioned earlier that the game is slightly in favor of the sharks. It is, mostly because they sharks can succeed with less teamwork than the divers need. However, the destructible envirionment allows for some neat tricks. I've actually almost run out of space.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predxenomorph/recommended/274940/","Predxenomorph","Kobayashi Maru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predxenomorph/","190 products in account","This one really caught me by surprise.  When I heard of a game about sharks vs humans, I thought to myself “that sounds stupid…  it’s just going to be a bad Left 4 Dead knockoff…”.  Never have I been more happy to be more wrong in my entire life.  Not only is this a well crafted first-person shooter.  This is right up there with Nosgoth as one of the best asymmetrical shooters I’ve played.\n\nDepth is a 4 vs 2 underwater shooter with a team of 4 divers taking on 2 shark players.  The divers play in first-person, and the sharks play in third-person.  The goal of the divers is to collect treasure from the ocean floor and give it to their robotic companion S.T.E.V.E., who is on the move quite often and prevents the divers from constantly camping in a single area.  Collecting the treasure has the purpose of giving each diver cash in which they can purchase better weapons before they respawn, as you only start with a pistol at the beginning.  Sharks, on the other hand, have to rely on kills for their upgrades; as each kill gives you an evolution point that you can spend in the evolution menu before you respawn.  Such evolutions include enhanced diver detection, tougher skin, regenerating health, longer speed boost, etc.\n\nPlaying as the humans is not too far off from standard first-person shooters, but the underwater combat gives it a an interesting uniqueness that separates it from the rest.  You can move in any direction and the movement feels natural.  Unlike some underwater sections of other shooters, the water doesn’t feel inhibiting and you can definitely put up a good fight once you get the hang of it.  Also, because you are underwater, all you projectiles have travel time.  They are by no means slow, but you will often have to lead the sharks slightly to land your hits.\n\nPlaying as the sharks is where this game really gets interesting.  It feels like playing a living torpedo with teeth on the end of it.  The sharks are extremely fast and stealthy, with only a heartbeat sound effect playing for the humans when a shark is close.  Grabs are extremely satisfying as you can boost into a room, grab a human, and leave with them, all within the space of a second.  The shark also has what I like to call the “shred” mechanic.  When you grab a human, you shake the mouse wildly to mimic the shaking of the head sharks do to shred their prey.  I don’t often say things like this, but whomever thought of adding this mechanic is a genius.  This makes attacks so much more satisfying, and really gets you immersed as playing the shark.\n\nAs I’ve said before, no game is perfect, and this game’s main issue is the content is a little on the light side.  It’s by no means minimal, but there is only one game mode, albeit a very good one, and 5 maps.  This can cause things to get slightly repetitive in long stretches of play, but if you play in hour or so stretches, it’s not really an issue.  The developer has announced mod tools for the game in the near future, so the map issue will likely become a non-issue once those are released.\n\nThis game is a fantastic experience, and a huge recommendation for anyone who has Steam.  Depth a great example of a simple idea and a developer wanting to make that experience as fun as possible.  Bravo developers, your passion is certainly felt in the final product.  So get to chomping on those divers, and keep on gaming!","November 9, 2014","true","85.0"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","1"

Now you just know things are going to get nasty. And bloody. Very bloody. And chunky.\n\nDepth is as satisfying to play as either a Diver or a Shark. Divers have access to some nifty weapons and gadgets. They also have S.T.E.V.E. their loot hunting electronic companion. Protect S.T.E.V.E. while he accesses hidden bounties. Take out those menacing sharks. Team, up and become rich but don't go it alone, unless you're uber sneaky or just batcrap insane. Beware, terror can come from all directions. Below, above and through vulnerable structures.\n\nAs a shark, it's all about the hunt. Use your instinct upgrades to sniff out those pesky leeching divers. Mangle their tender flesh to pieces. Munch on nearby seals to regain lost life. Being a shark is as awesome feeling as it sounds. Full 360 freedom of movement and that buzz when you go in for the kill. Be brutal or stealthy. Your choice.\n\nAs a diver, I often found myself being too greedy while collecting treasure. The more you pick up, the more bonus you receive when you drop your load off with S.T.E.V.E. Be careful though, you'll lose the lot if you're nabbed by a shark. Greed + risk = great rewards.\n\nVisually the game is a above par, considering the small team. Beautiful underwater effects, stunning detail of bounty-laden shipwrecks, the sprawling sea life, the fluid shark movement and flippy floppy animations of the diver's, errr, flippers. The team have also introduced full body awareness, which adds to the immersion. It's quite cool seeing your own legs/feet flipping around... but not so when they're lodged in a shark's mouth...stab him in the face to escape!\n\nA mention must also go to the game's audio. Stellar music and sound effects are in abundance as well as the blood curdling screams of your team mates when they're being thrashed to pieces by those nasty man eating fish. Your heartbeat resonates when you're near a shark, this only adds to the tension.\n\nTechnically, the game is very stable and smooth, utilising the Unreal Engine 3. The maps are sprawling, undersea death in disguise. Good, detailed textures adorn most surfaces and the water effects add to the chill. There's also destructibles, which play a key part of the game when playing as a shark. Add to that a plethora of game and graphical options, which PC gamers come to expect are here. Just shows you don't need to be a AAA multi million dollar publisher/game dev to make a decent PC game.\n\nOverall; a fab game at a reasonable price. A few more game modes wouldn't go a miss but i'll soldier on eating people and harpooning fish. I look forward to seeing what Quick & Co can cook up next.

As a shark, if your playing against smart divers that stick together its extremly hard to get a kill when working by yourself, especially when they are indoors. however working together as shark, its always good to come from two different angles or even have your shark buddy just hit the walls to distract the divers while you sneek in behind them.\n\nProblems with the game.\nwell i have done everything i could think of to boost proformance, cleared temp files, uninstaled unwanted programs, ended tasks in task manager, put all game settings to low or even turned the ones i could off to maximize fps. while in the game as shark i dont have any problems swimming around, however when i get close to the divers and start attacking them i get a little skippy. fps is around 10-15, and playing diver is really hard; i just spray and prey until i hit one of them because the game gets kinda skippy. so its a really good game but you need a pretty good graphics card. i have a toshiba satillite c875-s7303, around $550-600 laptop and still graphics card isnt good enouph.","November 9, 2014","true","6.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","2"

It is the job of the Divers to protect your robotic companion from, you've guessed it, the other players who are the hungry Sharks.\n\nNow I was surprised by how well put together the controls were as both the movement of the Divers and Sharks and all the animations are fluid and realistic. Everything feels responsive and how it should, which is a good thing in a game were it can take less than a couple of seconds to end up in the stomach of a great white. The levels are very atmospheric and each has it's own ambiance and 'vibe' and can be easily differentiated from one another, though there are only 5 maps in total right now which is a shame. The graphics are also polished to, and some levels do look simply gorgeous.\n\nThe gameplay works well, though it feels some maps favour the Divers and others favour Sharks slightly more, but with that said I have won and lost on all the maps so the essence of balance has obviously been carefully considered by the developers, and the game also requires an element of skill to play. No side is more powerful than the other which is what I was praying for when I installed the game. The sharks have their pros and cons, as do the divers, and both have special abilties/weapons they can upgrade with a points/monetary system. Divers build cash by collecting treasure and safely deopisiting it in S.T.E.V.E and Sharks gain points by gaining and chaining kills together.\n\nOverall the game is extremely fun and is nothing like anything out there on the market. It is the best "Jaws" game I have ever had the pleasure to play and it's a good thing to see developers managing to bring unique ideas to fruition. There is a lack of content with only one game mode and only 5 maps, which does feel steep for the price but I hope in time that there may be free updates or some reasonably priced DLC.\n\nIt is hard to explain what genre this game is though... at times it's an action game, and then it also feels like a horror game, which is rare considering it's multiplayer only (that, and the setting and game mechanics make this title stand out to me). All-in-all, it's definitely worth a buy.","November 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

I love the game, It's awesome just on concept alone. But for a game with "Depth" in the title, this game has very little depth itself.\n\nThere is no single player option, other than offline with bots, and that's okay... Unreal Tournament did something similar and it really worked for them. The main problem I have with this game is that there just isn't enough.\n\nThe weaponry and perks are awesome, but there's only one game mode and it's basically a deathmatch while you wait for S.T.E.V.E. to do his thing. Honestly if the dev could just add a couple game modes, this game would be excellent. There aren't too many weapons either, but realistically I guess there wouldn't be. Also there are only 3 character models for the divers and there are 4 divers... so two divers reuse the same skin.\n\nSo as the game stands right now, I just can't give it a good review. Is it awesome? Yes, but it lacks replay value. The goal is ALWAYS the same. With a couple of new game modes, this game would be incredible.\n\nUpdate: They added a new game mode! This is the first step towards becoming an awesome game! Megalodon Hunt is a new game mode in which 5 players take on one huge shark. Sadly there are still only 3 skins for players; but if they keep updating I might be ready to change my recommendation. I've also noticed a shark shield in the game which is (I'm sure) a way for the developers to attempt to please the players who complained about sharks being too overpowered.\n\nWhy don't I change my review to positive? because the gameplay is still horribly repetitive, all they've seem to have done is added another deathmatch mode. But it let it be known that they are still adding content to the game, which is alot to be said.","November 6, 2014","false","2.5"," 311 of 527 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","311","527","13","15"

Speaking for myself i've been having a blast playing it and i just got it a few days ago. It's fast paced matches usually don't take an extreme ammount of time. Matchfinding times are short, and the gameplay is set up pretty well in my opinion as far as usage and balance. I can see how it might possibly get old for some people but so far i've had it maybe 3 days and already spent 12 and a half hours in it and i don't even have much time for games I'm usually working but i've been off for 2 days and it's been a blast in this short time. Fun to play with friends or alone. Being a diver can give you that feel like a classic The Hidden-Source of never knowing when you're going to be slaughtered and the great feel when hunting down the shark and netting them and shooting them to bits. By far my favorite thing in this though is playing as the shark. I mainly play as the shark and there is no better feeling then swooping sombody in and out of a room ripping them to bits.\n\nSo TLDR If you want a cheaply priced game that you'll definantly get your money out of and have a blast alone or with friends as long as you're willing to get the hang of playing and get past being new, then this is a great game.\nI hope to see you all down below...in the Depths where I lurk","December 25, 2014","true","51.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","6"

It needs no further explanation. Both ‘factions’ want you to kill the opposite party, except that the divers have some extra objectives here. What we all want to know is: is this that one new multiplayer game that we’re all looking for ? Is this one that finally stands out ? Well, I’m not going to answer that here, that would be too easy. Another day, another review. Here we go:\n\nMatches in Depth take place in five different maps. Obviously, these maps are all under water and because of the water and the depth the atmosphere is dark, confusing and tense. Downside to this is that the environments don’t really stand out, and that every map looks pretty much the same. This will change after just a few matches because there actually are subtle differences to be found in each map, even if the objectives are always the same. Same goes for the layout. But it mostly comes down to swimming through different buildings, so there isn’t as much variety as I would’ve hoped.\nAfter just a few matches you’ll learn exactly where to go and what to do. The divers will have to follow and protect S.T.E.V.E., a robot that unlocks safes at specific points on the map. It will usually take him a few minutes before he heads to the next area. In these couple of minutes it’s your job to find as many treasures as you can. Treasures can be found all over the place and are usually in places you shouldn’t go into, at least not without backup. And like I said, you also have to protect S.T.E.V.E. He has a health bar of his own and it’s game over if this bar gets depleted. Fortunately, this is a tough little robot and taking him out is a task in itself. Sharks will usually bash him a couple of times, but he’ll rarely get destroyed. Unless things go completely wrong, like when team members purposely disconnect from the game. The game doesn’t handle these situations very well I’m afraid: teams don’t get balanced, and if an entire team leaves the game will still continue until it’s over. Why ? I have no idea.\nAnd you may have already guessed it, but the sharks have to kill the divers. That’s all they have to do really because well, they’re sharks. The team of sharks consists of 2 players while the divers have a team of 4 people.\nEach team has 30 tickets, and each respawn will cost the team own ticket. If one of them reaches zero the other team has won. The divers are also able to win the game if they can get S.T.E.V.E. safely back to the boat.\nRespawns are usually fair, with enough room between you and the sharks. I’ve had a few times where I spawned pretty much in front of a shark, but thankfully these situations don’t happen very often and usually take place when you’re about to get back to the boat.\nOne of the other things I enjoyed was the fact that divers hear a heartbeat whenever a shark gets close. It’ll go faster the closer it gets so it makes for some fun situations, because you still never quite know when to expect things, and where they’re coming from.\nThe divers also have the ability to buy new guns and equipment (like mines and flares) with the money they make from killing sharks and collecting treasures. The weapons remain in your possession for the entirety of a game so no need to continuously repurchase stuff. You can even sell your gun to use the extra cash for a weapon that better suits your needs. It’s a solid idea that more games should use. Naturally this also depends on the kind of game.\nSharks will use a mix of active and passive skills. They start with 2 available points to spend but each one of the skills requires a specific number of points. Some of the best skills require 6 points, for example, but you can quickly earn points by killing enemies.\nCompleting a game allows your character/profile to level up. Level up and you’ll unlock a new weapon for the divers or a skill for the shark (never at the same time). So level 1 unlocks a weapon, level 2 a skill, 3 a weapon, 4 a skill and so on. You get the idea.\nThe game does feel a little empty as far as features are concerned because it has only 5 maps and one gameplay mode. Don’t get me wrong, I had a great time with it, even now, but it’s just a matter of when before it becomes too boring and/or repetitive. I just hope more content gets added later on. Other than that, I had a blast playing it.\n\nI already mentioned it a few times but the graphics are dark and atmospheric. You can hardly see a thing out there, which is good because it balances the gameplay but also because you’re deep under water so it only makes sense. Objects and characters have plenty of detail up close, but the gameplay is so fast that you probably won’t notice any of it. There’s also a bit of gore in it; you’ll regularly see dead characters with bitten off limbs down there (including your own). Blood flows nicely and in a realistic manner and the water physics are done very well. I can’t say that I was not impressed by it all, even if it’s no Crysis (obviously).\nThe sounds are kept to a minimum; you’ll mostly hear beeps from radars/sonars and your characters’ heartbeat. Same goes for the music, but I have to be honest here and tell you that I couldn’t really pay attention to it because of the fast gameplay and the pretty loud sounds.\n\nYou could play this game for tens of hours and not get bored with it. That’s because you’ll unlock something useful every time you level up. If I’m not mistaken there are 22 levels so it should take you about 20-30 hours to reach that level I think. After that you can do some matches with your newly unlocked gear, but I think the fun will start to wear off by then. I truly hope there will be some extra maps and gameplay modes soon, if this game is to survive.\n\nDepth is an excellent, fun and, above all, tense game with an already impressive community. You’ll rarely have to wait more than a few minutes before you can start a match. Let’s hope this keeps up and more people will join in on the fun soon. It’s a game that really deserves the attention.\nAll we need now is some more content and then we’ll have a heck of a game here.\nI’ve rarely seen an indie multiplayer game this polished. And then I’m talking about both the gameplay and the technical aspect behind it. Amazing job, and highly recommended.\n\n[Rating: 81/100]","November 3, 2014","true","2.7"," 46 of 69 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","46","69","0","1"

Play as a Shark and hunt players, or play as the food and try to avoid being lunch for the sharks, either way you are probably going to have a good time. The game doesn't have a lot of maps to play on, and the content seems a bit repetitive; However, since the main focus of the game is on PVP, that isn't exactly surprising. The movement in-game is pretty good for an underwater game and the lighting is just about right, enough to startle you from time to time when a shark blindsides you.\n\nI would like to see more content personally. I get that it is a PVP multiplayer game, but more maps to play on will make it interesting and lend some variety to the game. I'm sad they didn't stick with the original concept of having a Single Player RPG, and instead scrapped that idea for a full on Multiplayer PVP game, but it is still a decent game.","July 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","28","38","0","1"

Good balancing, can recommend!\n\nAs I started to play this game, I thought something like 'hmm, that is a nice small game. Maybe not worth the full price, but nice, anyway'. I changed my mind over the six hours I played the game. Actually I think that this game is absolutely awesome! Even if I wish that there is more content I can absolutely recommend it for the full price.\n\nWhy?\n\nGiant sharks killing people is a really cliched thing. You know it, the devs know it, I know that. But, to be honest, this is one of the things that make this game awesome. It is cliched and I'm fine with it.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is there, even if this game is really casual. You have to get involved with this game (hopefully this is the right formulation, I don't know exactly how to say that in english), of course. But then you can really enjoy the depth.\n\nDepth is based on the player skills. There is a leveling system, but it is only for the actual game and will be resetted as soon as you go back to the main menu.  As a shark you will gain special abilities like "cut the divers torso with your fins".\nThere's also a permanent level system, but it don't give you op-skills.\nThe divers get money by collecting gold and protecting S.T.E.V.E. From the money, they can buy weapons and other items like flares and water mines.\n\nThe balancing is a thing...At first I thought the divers were overpowered, then I thought the sharks were op. Then the divers again....I won with sharks and I won with divers. I lost with sharks and I lost with divers. It's at least good enough.\nThe most important thing is to work as a team. If a team don't do this, it'll lose - no matter if shark or diver.","November 7, 2014","true","15.1"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","3"

At the core this is a great game. The gameplay and mechanics are pretty great. It has a great atmosphere and setting that gets you into the moment. There is enough variety in diver weapons/sharks selections to allow to different strategies and tactics. It allows for skill to be honed to truly excel at the game. Can be a lot of fun playing with friends. The devs for this game are pretty good and responsive to the community.\n\nHowever, I feel the game has almost as many draw backs. The player base is as good as dead, averages only 100 players worldwide at any given time. Over many months after release it has shown no ability to retain new players and grow despite free weekends, multiple sales, and content updates. There is limited content with only 1 gamemode that is played (despite other modes being introduced, nobody plays them and they're just a novelty). Basically, it gets repetitive and you eventually lose interest.\n\nThe quality of the matches themselves I'd say are pretty poor in terms of matchmaking. 99% of the time its a total landslide and uncompetitive. This leads to a lot of rage quiting where you'll probably be playing bots in the majority of your matches. One last thing, I've heard from other people who have tried out this game is that while the gameplay is good its also very stressful. Even if you win the general feeling after a game is "Thank god that is over" rather than that of celebration or accomplishment. To a degree I'd have to agree with that assesment.\n\nI'll give it a thumbs up because I do think its a great game but it comes with a lot of drawbacks.

Which forces you to retreat to heal.\n\nAdding to the fun-ness of the sharks, when you attack the divers you have to quickly move your mouse back and forth to simulate the violent sawing action that sharks do to tear apart their prey. This can be disorienting after an attack.\n\nthe divers get underwater assault rifles, pistols, and harpoons, among various equipment to detect and immobilize the sharks, but being able to be attacked from any angle when you least expect it definitely gives the odds in favor of the sharks.\n\nThere is definitely a lot of tension for the divers. The maps are usually dark or foggy. The diver's hearts audibly pump faster when sharks are near (giving a warning to the player, despite there being no visible shark on screen) but that's only when they're close, which a good shark won't be until he's already lunging at you and chomping you in half.\n\nDefinitely a fun experience, games do not take a long time, there are unlocks which add to replayability but otherwise this is good for a few rounds of something different, it might not hold onto a lot of people's attention after the first few months though.\n\nI'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars!","November 3, 2014","true","89.2"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","25","33","0","0"

They added more maps, weapons and gamemodes.  The developers added more sharks and weapons and did nothing to balance the game, match making takes forever and the game really isn't fun anymore.\n\n\nIntense underwater combat between a team of four divers and two sharks.    The combat is exciting and teambased. There are plenty of weapons and unlocks with level based unlocks.   You start with limited cash or set points (as a shark you get points)  and you earn more by killing the opposing team, collecting loose gold, completing objectives, and the most important assisting and saving teammates.  There is even an option to play wtih bots so you can learn some skills before taking on real players\n\nAs a diver you must watch eachothers back to protect S.T.E.V.E. ( an underwater recovery robot,  I am sure it stands for something I dont care enough to know lol).   your robot compaion will progress through the map spot to spot and can be disabled by the sharks.   He will usually set up in a defensable area but there is always at least one open area he sets up in and a straight open water swim that sets the sharks up.\n\nAs a shark you work together with your teammate to take down the divers.  If you take too long the divers can escape with their robot and loot.   You can disable their robot to slow down their progress.  The sharks have a range of abilities that they can earn by killing divers.   They are fast but not as agile as diver,  they make up for their lack of agility by ripping the divers to shreds.\n\nThis game has the best matchmaking IMO.  Its like l4d but your lobby can start when ever and instead of playing with bots you get matched with solo players or other parties.  The only downside is your party always stays visibile in game so people will join and complain about you be AFK because they do not understand what is going on.\n\nAll in All this game is bomb.  It is incredibly fun and competitive.  It could use some more maps and a smidge of balance here and there but that is what patches are for.

They can either kill the divers down to 0 or take out their robot, STEVE.\n\nSTEVE also has a health bar, if the divers aren’t careful and STEVE is completely destroyed they lose their ability to respawn and once killed remain dead, and thus the Sharks have won.\nThere is also a “Megladon mode” -- where a team of 5 divers go against a giant megaladon shark, and you can find treasure to make your weapons more powerful and whoever kills the shark first then becomes the shark, the next time it spawns.\n\nPROS\n-Great multiplayer gameplay\n-Easy to pick up and play but also has some mastery to it as well\n-Unique concept\n-Both Diver and Shark gameplay is really fun and varied from one another\n-Cool/Spooky environments\n\nPossibly the strongest point to Depth is the unique concept behind it, I can’t honestly think of too many games that I can compare it to except for possibly Evolve.\n\nBut easily one of the best aspects it has going for it, is the pick up and play and ease of access to the gameplay, I had no trouble at all getting sorted with the controls or figuring out what I needed to do within the first couple of minutes of gameplay.\n\nBut that’s not say there isn’t any mastery to the gameplay, it definitely still has a skill curve, for example we ran into our share of very experienced players every now and then who completely ripped us apart.\n\n… Literally.\n\nThe gameplay over all works really well, the controls are smooth and easy to figure out for both the divers and the sharks and the weapon load outs and different shark species you can play as are varied enough to experiment around with, and over all the game feels very balanced from what I played with in my four or five or so hours I spent with Depth.\nBut easily the best part of the game is playing as the shark, picking off the divers one by one and trying to spook them after you’ve destroyed their STEVE robot felt very satisfying.\n\nThe shark gameplay also requires a fair amount of skill, you can’t blindly rush 4 divers expecting to come out alive, you’ll have to play it smart, destroy certain walls to get a good vantage point or try and set up an ambush or single out the divers swimming too far away from the rest of the group.\n\nPlaying as the shark felt very tactical to play as, something I’m awful at personally, but never the less is easily some of the best moments of the game when you can pull off a perfect ambush on some divers.\n\n\nNow graphically Depth isn’t much to look at, the texture work is passable, and the character models on the divers aren’t anything special.\n\nBut the environments themselves stand out pretty well, they range from deep sea mines, to sunken ships, to even ancient underwater ruins, and they all have a great atmosphere and very spooky to explore, Depth nails its underwater environments and atmosphere.\n\nCONS\n-Match making is a bit finicky (minor)\n-Not much content or variety\n-Crashing issues\n-Glitches (minor)\n\nWe had quite a bit of trouble early on figuring out how match making worked but we managed to get it working, so this is more or less a minor issue, but the match making was pretty confusing at first.\n\nBut probably my biggest issue with Depth is the lack of content, we played this over the free steam weekend, and we pretty much played everything the game had to offer and we were already kind of over it by Sunday.\nOnce you’ve played each of the maps as both divers and sharks and the megladon mode a few times, you’ve pretty much played most the game has to offer.\n\nHowever, we did have a few odd glitches in our 5 or so hours with the game, such as picking a class of shark and somehow ending up as a completely different type of shark when the round started.\nTo some crashing issues every now and then.\n\nNow as for the soundtrack side of things, it’s nothing really special and pretty forgettable, but this is minor since thankfully you can select your own music through Steam’s playlist feature.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nAt the end day, if you’ve got some friends and you’re looking for a fun and unique game, then definitely consider giving Depth a try, it’s a fun multiplayer experience that’s easy to dive right into. Just watch out for those pesky sharks when you do.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 20, 2015","true","4.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanova/recommended/274940/","kanova","Kanova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanova/","115 products in account","This game is great. That is putting it as simply as I can.\n\nPlaying as a diver, you get a basic set of tools to defend yourself, ranging from a pistol with a few shots to a harpoon gun or a net. Then there are consumables and utlity items. These things like flairs, mines and a DPV which is something that lets you move at incredible speeds and maybe even out maneuver the average shark. There are upgrades you can get that that let you track sharks with special bullets or different guns. Collect treasure on the ocrean floor and turn it in and protect your robot to get more money.\n\nAs a shark you have superior speed and ability to travel the map and see where the divers and their robot are. you can destroy objects and terrian to open new ways to attack. Attacking a diver hold him in your mouth and shred him apart and carry him away from his group. BUT they can stab you in the face while being mauled. Sharks have upgrades that make them more deadly. These range from having better senses, more resistant to damage, getting better maneuverability or getting health from eating stuff. Oh yeah, regain health from eating poor defensless seals.\n\nUnlock more upgrades as your profile level increases and play as a vicious shark in an epic game of cat and mouse, or as a diver with weapons and mines to decimate sharks at a distance...if you can see them first. Playing as solo, it is fun for a while but I think that with friends the game would be 10x better.\n\nGame is still a 10/10, I notice no real problems. It is balanced, atmospheric and has some pretty good replay value and reminds me of Left 4 Dead in some ways.","November 4, 2014","true","21.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lusciouscraig/recommended/274940/","lusciouscraig","Luscious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lusciouscraig/","41 products in account","Sharks vs. humans. Do I need say more?\n\nI will anyway...\nI'll say my overall thought on the game before I really talk about what's in the game. Although I personally think this game is a 10/10, I will warn you that if you get bored of one gamemode easily this might not be your game. The one gamemode this game has brings fun refreshing gameplay that feels unique to the FPS genre, of course, it's also really fun to eat people in 3rd person as the shark.\n\nAfter playing as both a diver and shark as much as I have (add another 12 hours of time I played during the beta), I would say Depth is fairly well balanced (highly based on skill level, you will get a butt whoopin' every now and then). Sharks do seem a little bit on the OP side due to their speed but I pretty much only feel this way against a select few players that I know by name. I cannot stress enough how skill based this game is, but I've never had this much fun.\n\nI believed I have covered everything necessary.. If you have any further questions about depth feel free to message me!\n\nIf you've seen Evolve gameplay it's very similar, exept replace the monster with 2 sharks, and the 4 hunters with divers. Depth has some fairly simple goals for each team. The sharks earn points for killing divers and can spend those points towards perks which grant the shark new abilities. Sharks can also recover health by eating seals that swim around the map. Divers on the other hand, must try to stay alive and accumulate enough gold to purchase better gear whilst also defending S.T.E.V.E. the robot companion that will work its way across the map opening safes. If the divers kill all the sharks or escort S.T.E.V.E. back to the boat, the sharks have failed to defend their territorry.\n\nDepth has some interesting features that help make the gameplay feel unique:\n- To do damage as a shark, you have to shake your mouse back and forth violently. The Sharks are given "wallhack" so that they can always see where the divers are. It is most important that the sharks use this to their advantage to take out divers one by one. Sharks can also choose to attack S.T.E.V.E. doing so will stall S.T.E.V.E. and require him to reboot, enough damage to S.T.E.V.E. will destroy him. Sharks have a wide variety of perks to choose from which you can combine in ways to make your shark tougher, faster, or smarter (earning "wallhack" on mines or seeing what weapon a diver is holding).\n- The Divers are given a heart beat sound which speeds up the closer they are to a shark. If the heart is pounding, you're probably about to feed the shark. The only ways the divers can get the "wallhack" effect on the sharks is by using sonar beacons or flares (both with limited range), or tracing rounds (limited time). There is lots of diver gear to choose from, I won't list every single one but there are multiple pistols, auto rifes, and spear type weapons.\n\n\nREVIEW UPDATE (as of last major patch in December):\n-There are now two additional sharks to play as, The Mako - agile but weak, and The Tiger - the average shark. The Great White was turned into a swimming tank.\n-An additional map has been added bringing the total maps up to 6, all maps feel very balanced\n-They also added a King of the Hill style gamemode using the Megalodon shark as the "hill". The gamemode can be summarized as such: collect gold as a diver to upgrade your weapons (similar to the core game) win by reaching 15000 points first, the fastest way to score is to be the Megalodon shark. Become the Megalodon by killing the player who is the Megalodon. Gamemode is very very casual and not intense at all. Not my cup of tea (but that's just my opinion)","December 7, 2014","true","239.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

The periods of tension separate combat - which is visceral, chaotic, bloody, and fast-paced. Divers must explore the depths of the ocean for valuable treasure while fending off attacks from ravenous sharks. Shark players stalk and bide their time for opportune windows of attack, lunging in and ripping apart unwary divers.\n\nReview\n\nI absolutely love this game! It has fast paced action, good mechanics and a great atmosphere and tension-building. At the beginning of each round, sharks have the advantage and players must rely on team strategy to survive. Placing Sonar Buoys is a good way to know where the sharks are coming from, and taking them down as a team.\nAs the game progresses, players are able to buy better guns, mines etc. and now the sharks must rely on teamwork to get the job done.\nAvoiding Sonar Buoys and Mines, staying in the shadows and attacking together is the best way to go. I really enjoy this game. Definitely recommend picking this one up.\n\n8/10","November 3, 2014","true","9.7"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourson/recommended/274940/","yourson","Kalora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourson/","62 products in account","I feel like a lot of the negative reviews were posted before certain changes in the game were made.  I might be wrong, but that's just my two cents because I really enjoy this game.  I bought it a few days ago and I've played it every day at least once.  It's a game where you're on edge, alert, and become pretty satisfied when you do good.  However, the opposite is true, and this game is full of skillful players who will easily tear through your team.  You never know how good your team mates might be, so sometimes it's fun to play with the skillful players instead of getting your butt beat by them.\n\nThere are two game modes you can play, and I hope the developers keep adding more content to the game.  The first game mode is Blood and Gold where you follow a robot named steve around through different stages you have to swim to and then camp in.  However, you also need to collect treasure in order to afford better weapons and after you collect all the treasure in the room steve is in, you need to swim out to find more or wait for steve to move again.  The sharks go after the divers to keep them from farming treasure and upgrading weapons.  They can also smash into steve to make it drop collected treasure and stall it.  The match is "timed" in two ways.  One, if steve reaches the boat to be pulled up, the divers win.  However, both teams are given 30 respawns.  When the divers or sharks reach 0 and the last one dies, the other team wins.\n\nThe second mode is Megalodon which is like a Saxton Hale type thing (For Team Fortress 2 players).  One person gets to be the Megalodon and everyone else collects treasure to upgrade their weapon.  Whoever kills the Megalodon gets to play as him.\n\nSome people say that they feel like the game is unbalanced, but I think it really does depend on the skill of the player.  If you play a few games against some of the same sharks who swipe people without you even landing a shot on them and your team loses before you even get to the second area, of course you'd think sharks are OP.  Or maybe if you're a shark getting hunted by harpoon-wielding divers you'd think this game favors the divers.  It all depends on skill.\n\nSo far, I've had so much fun playing this game and I 100% recommend it.  I'm not super great at it, and some matches I really suck, but I don't care because I'm having so much fun!  It's a great game to play with friends.","March 4, 2015","true","89.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

Quit Penalty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raygquit/","179 products in account","I think I postponed this review for far too long. I am torn between pure flattery for the game (just look at my time played) and speaking some "truth" about it. Depth is amazing, the gameplay is fun, intense and challenging, the skill ceiling is really high and the things you can do after you 'get good' are absolutely amazing. You know what they say: being called a hacker is the greatest form of flattery for a gamer - you get this here. Playing as diver is quite different from the usual FPS because you have to learn how to fight against freaking beasts of the sea that will force you to fight them not only horizontally but also vertically. Sharks on the other hand are a blast to play, but they require a lot of planning and skill to get to the divers and survive ... or you can ... you know, go in and hope for the best. Which brings me to the well, not "bad" things per se, but things to be aware.\n\nNow the mentioned truth I would like to share is the fact that this game may not be a very good for casuals as a long term experience. If you don't have a learning curve, you may get outskilled very easily. Due to small community you will encounter pros from time to time and let's be honest, some of them can take average team alone and get called a hacker - that is how ridiculously high the skill ceiling is. That's of course no one's fault, there isn't enough veterans for the matchmaker to make them play only with each other. And remember - it's just from time to time, you won't always get to fight against or with pros. Then again some of the Depth players seems to lack basic understanding of the game despite playing 100+ matches and just forces you to facepalm while playing. Wasting tickets is on the daily basis here, especially if you're already acustomed to the game you will be sometimes forced to carry your teammember(s).\n\nMake no mistake, community is small, but it's very stable, I've been here for almost a year and always can find a game (for divers it's almost instant, but for sharks it takes from 1 to 3 minutes and somethimes it gets down to 4-6 min). Also the community is mostly friendly and active (visit the steam discussions).\n\nSo what I want to say is: the game is amazing, the community is amazing, but the difference in skill cap you will feel on many levels, which will put you in all kinds of adventages and disadventages against some setups in teams. One more thing: the game recives a FREE content every 2 months or so that includes maps, new sharks to play, weapons and things like that so that's nice thing to have.","March 5","true","931.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","2"

Kill the humans and chew through their respawn points before they complete the circuit.\n\nBoth teams have a large array of purchasable evolutions/weapons/technology to adapt to the other team's techniques and technology allowing for an experience that keeps the game alive and fresh for much longer than it's asking price.\n\nThe game is very fast, intense, aiming is difficult and it posesses enough tactical depth to keep one involved for a long time.\n\nI highly recommend it.","November 3, 2014","true","41.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

The fool hardy humans who are diving in the ocean looking for treasures, and the sharks that hunt the humans until there are none left. Humans are able to purchase various weapons and gadgets to help them survive underwater and sharks are able to upgrade their lethal capabilities with upgrade points.\nI like the claustrophobic environments in this game as well as the vast customization Depth offers for human equipment/weapons as well as with sharks.\nThe maps in this game are vast however since you're not exploring them too often (You can if you dare) you're usually inside underwater ruins, inside there are small corridors and it becomes nerve racking because you never know if there is a shark around the corner.. Unless you have the right equipment! When I said vast customization I do mean quite large, you are able to purchase various upgrades for human weapons E.G tracking rounds, poison rounds and much more. You can also duel wield certain guns if wish! Sharks also have quite a bit of variety when it comes to upgrades, you can evolve razor sharp fins which will let you cut humans as you pass by, or evolve to heal when out of combat or be able to smell humans with ease.\nI am very happy this game has been able to climb out of Early Access with positive reviews and I think this game will be a great addition to your library if you intend on buying it (Which you should)","October 2, 2015","true","13.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

While true if you pick shark as your preferred class you will be waiting for a while, and for good cause! You silently swim around the zone they are currently in, looking for a small gap or a fairly broken wall to use. Once an opening is ready you wait for the prey to swim by and ..... SNAP!THRASH!RIP!SHRED! In a few seconds of intense frenzy you die in agony as the other three prey unloads into your soft white belly.\n\nTeamwork, skill, and a healthy dose of luck is needed in this game.\n\nAs humans you can do a great amout of things to ward off the sharks. Booby trapping the gaps, Putting up sensor bouyis along the wall and cieling making it harder to get destroyed by the shark, and sitting in that one god damn spot up near the corner of the room. You start off with a measly pistol, but with the help of teamates you must stick together untill later weapons are unlocked. Soon you will unlock a single insta-gib weapon and will be able to solo the shark, that is, if you see him in time.\n\nAs the shark you are the hunter who chooses when to engage. You can go in and hope to pull you out from the room, or wait until they move out into the open towards the next room. Watch out for bombs though, but if quick enough you can speed right past it and set it off without dying, and if lucky enough you could kill the human swimming next to it. You need to use the enviroment to your advantage. Swim through an open window, snag and then dash out the next opening as soon as you kill the person. Hit and run is the only way to win this.\n\nAll in all this is a great game.\n\n9/10","November 4, 2014","true","6.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","1"

It's fun to play and hard to dominate. It seems to be very well balanced if you play smart. All of the videos make it seem like constant shark attacks, and it is in a way, but the pacing is just right when you actually play it. Being a diver is just as fun as being a shark. This game can be terrifying if you're the last diver alive...and your heart starts beating. The videos of this game online have a poor frame rate but when played is actually very smooth, I'm maxing this game easily.\n\nI also honestly don't think the sharks move too fast. It's very easy to kill either team, so playing smart is a must. If anything the divers have a pretty good advantage.I think this game has huge potential. Just a few more maps, shark types and larger community would make this move from "very good" to "excellent". Also, this is coming from someone with an unatural and irrational fear of sharks. I'm still learning to swim in open water....(shivers)\n\nPros:\n1. Good graphics\n2. Cool setting\n3. Fun gameplay\n4. Easy to learn, hard to master\n5. Inexpensive\n6. Kinda creepy (at best)\n\nCons:\n1. Limited maps and game modes\n2. Not enough players yet\n3. Latency spikes that get me killed\n4. Scary as h*ll (at worst)\n\nUPDATE!!!:  Dec. 2014\n\nFirst major content release includes new sharks, a new mode, a new map :) and new diver gear.\nThey added a Tiger shark and a Mako plus tweaks to the good old Great White.\nThe GW now acts as a tank and withstands the most abuse. Seems they nerfed the speed a little which is ok. The Tiger seems to be the replacement for the GW in terms of speed and vitality. The Mako is unsurprisingly the fastest and weakest. Cool. The new map is awesome, it's an underwater mine shaft? But I don't know how sharks feel about it ( I play diver 95% of the time, by choice.\n\nThe new shark shield diver tool is pretty neat since the sharks can't see you if you're in its radius. Physically see you, yes. But not through the walls like thermal vision as usual.\n\nThe MEGALODON mode is boring in my opinion. 5 divers vs 1 (baby) Megalodon. Basically divers super grind for gold and recieve auto gun upgrades (no choice basically). Hunt the giant shark and the person landing the final blow becomes the Megalodon. The shark is slow and always under attack. The divers can DPV infinately and chase you anywhere. Once they get enough gold and receive the explosive harpoon, it's all over. You'll get a few kills and die. Both sides were equally boring.\n\nIn conclusion, I greatly appreciate the new and free content. I want more maps, guns, balance and player base to be 100% satisfied. This game is constantly improving and I applaud the devs. Once you start to unlock evos and guns the game gets better. The learning curve was just raised with this update but don't give up.This game is so much fun I just can't explain it!!\n\nUPDATE!!!  Jan. 2016\nThis game continues to impress me with just how fun it continues to be. After nearly 1000 hours logged I keep coming back. Since my last update they've added a ton of content, new maps and sharks, diver gear and balance. There are at least twice the maps as launch and a total of 6 sharks, Hammerhead, Thresher and Bull have been added since my last update. Everything I could ask for but.....we still can't keep a decent player base going.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are always matches to be played but this game scares people off....there ARE veteran players, and you WILL get your ♥♥♥ handed to you. That being said there are MANY great vets that will help you out. Honestly, the problem is gamers these days, they hate challenge and learning and they hate getting advice. They want their game EZ and can't stand learning even if that means losing at times. Sure, winning is more fun but so is watching your skill grow.\nIf you're willing to make friends and learn through some losses, you'll really begin to appreciate what this game can offer. As I said earlier, it's easy to learn and hard to master, you've been fairly warned.\n\nThe community is interesting for sure. Most everyone will be helpful but in return you need to be receptive. At least TRY to understand how the game works. If you jump on the forums to blindly complain about everything being OP, you'll get blasted.\nSeriously, go look at the discussions to get an idea of how NOT to act if you want to get the most enjoyment from this game. Just look at the hours played by those that cry and those that don't. Are you going to believe that someone with 10 hours of gametime truly understands the intricacies more than those with 100's of hours?\nThey've added plenty of noob friendly mechanics to this game and endless balancing tweeks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayneAir/recommended/274940/","JayneAir","Fish Boy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayneAir/","13 products in account","I've had a blast playing it. There's surprising amounts of strategy for a game that appears two-dimensional for what's basically a hybrid kind of multiplayer FPS. It's a fun game to play hard. Higher level sharks are kind of unbeatable unless divers have upgrade opportunity early and ALL the divers are playing hard with considerable in-game experience.\nThe game is FUN so far. I've been playing mostly divers through quickmatch. I've only tried a few games as sharks, preferring on increasing my skill on one side versus the other first. Unless I do a little matchmaking, it's still hard to beat good sharks. Especially those working in tandem well together with good builds, but I've been told a lvl zero shark who gets good evolution planning via web resources is still a formidable opponent versus mid to high level divers, and I've experienced tht as being the case. Great community so far - though I got excoriated playing shark early and not knowing what I was doing and getting insulted by a high level shark I was playing with. I was pretty steamed about the lack of support from an experienced player to someone literally brand new in the game, but that has been the exception rather the norm. I've had other very high level sharks say it was perfectly cool and drop me pointers when after the first experience I immediately told other shark players I got teamed with I was a noob.\nI did not get this through steam, but at an outside vendor, so I got it for around eight bucks, but read that it does go on sale on occassion for deep discounting. I have tried none of the DLC so far, but it looks cool. I'll get some down the line to support the devs.\nI love it. I recommend it.","May 27","true","67.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Being a diver is a claustrophobic, dark, terror-driven nightmare where you have to gather treasure as you carefully move from point to point. Your defense against the predatory sharks consists of:\n\n- regular guns (pistols, machine guns)\n- spear/harpoon guns\n- useful consumable items like flares and mines.\n\nThese are purchased via a CS:GO-like economy system; want more cash to upgrade to a better weapon? You have to take the risk of moving away from the designated path to grab more loot (and be an easier target for fast-moving teeth!).\n\nPlaying as the sharks, on the other hand, is equally exhilarating, but from a position of delicate power instead of insane fear. You are essentially a glass-cannon archetype: able to inflict immense bursts of damage via razor-sharp teeth (and, later, via brutal charges using your dangerous fins), but able to be taken down with only a few shots from a wary diver's pistol...or a single harpoon. You have the ability to effortless glide through the murky waters (and it is dark!) and explode out of the shadows to rip an unknowing diver to literal pieces. Your abilities include forceful dashes (a small one and a larger one) and sprints that consume various amounts from a slowly-refilling pool of energy; once you grab hold of a diver, you thrash your mouse back and forth to tear the flailing swimmer limb from limb. You can also break through weak points in walls, ceiling, and floors! Lastly, your upgrades consist of unique predator traits like the ability to spot mines more easily, slice apart divers with serrated fins, regenerate health after a successful kill, and many others.\n\nTL;DR - Depth is a 2v4 (two sharks vs four divers) asymmetric PvP multiplayer indie game (you can play in parties of 6 if you want to hear only your best buds' shrieks of panic). If you haven't given Depth a whirl, I can't recommend it enough. It's fresh, visceral, intense, and an absolute blast to play with friends or against random internet strangers.","November 5, 2014","true","12.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

S.T.E.V.E. was literally already in the crane and on his way back up to the Captain but I tore that last diver to pieces. A blood red scoreboard tells me Sharks Won. Apparently the Captain can keep his gold. I just ate 32 divers in one round as a shark. This is not a fair game, but it is a well balanced game. How could it be fair to play 2 vs 4? In the end, it's just an issue of instincts and timing. If you play shooters then you know how to play Depth.\n\nIt's the free-play weekend and at level 77, played this game 156 hours, it's july played continuously since last November. Game is constantly improving. I always go Thresher.\n\n\nOriginal:\n\nEasily among the best PvP games I've ever played. Its 4 divers collecting treasure while 2 sharks attack them ferociously. Sometimes you get a bad team of divers who just swim out into open water and get eaten again and again so look out for that. Nobody seems to be using microphones yet and that would be useful for both teams. Perfect balance of picturesque graphics and heart-pounding, fast-paced gameplay.\n\n\n\n\nReEdit:\n\nEDIT\nOh my love, where do I begin? The first 100 hours was nothing like what happened after that. This game is Counter Strike crossed with Elite Dangerous, once you have mastered the tools (and use your microphone). I was hoping for a game to help me get ready for Evolve, but that game was a POS. Depth is a million times better than Evolve for a creature shooter because having two of the monster team is much more likely to produce a good round even after match-making. I can only compare this game to Natural Selection because it has such radically different team abilities on the two sides. The game is simply not the same for the divers and the sharks.\n\nIn the beginning, you try to make sense of the diver tools under fire by the sharks or else you go straight to sharking. Turn up your brightness (past the extra 20% if you want to shoot like the leaderboarders) and get ready for knee jerking action because some of the sharks out there are too fierce to mess with unless you have quick reflexes and strong communication skills. I once called out a friend for only playing as a shark, but then I found that the true joy of Depth is in calling it SHARK SIMULATOR! Still, I try to keep my diver:shark games to 1:1. Once you become a deadly shark, well then you discover the true apex predator in the ocean, the top 10 leaderboard DIVERS. These guys will skewer all 32 sharks in short work and getting hunted down by these users is the most terrifying experience of my life.\n\nThe thrill of the game isn't in the kill but in the chase and it gets my heart pounding out of my chest. It's safe to say I love Depth even more than Counter Strike and that's just how it is.\n\n\nI play the game using a Razer Orbweaver where the thumbstick/arrowkeys are bound as my ascend, strafe left, descend, strafe right.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/recommended/274940/","IxianMace","IxianMace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/","57 products in account","As a single-player oriented gamer, I found Depth to be the first game that made me prefer multi-player over single-player. This may or may not be a good thing, however.\n\nAt the time of this review, the game currently has 2 game modes and 6 maps. In 'Blood and Gold' mode, 4 divers face off against 2 sharks, and in 'Megalodon Hunt', there is only 1 'super shark' against an entire team of divers, with divers gaining the ability to become the shark by killing it. This game mode seems more like a 'King of the Hill' type deal, where every player is attempting to become the first to reach 15,000 points. Divers purchase equipment, which is paid for by credits gained from collecting treasure/unlocking safes. Sharks gain 'ability points' by killing divers. These points are then spent on activating various 'perks', increasing the overall ability of the shark. The game has a wide range of adjustable graphics options, a working push-to-talk/open-mic communication system, and an adjustable field-of-view slider that can go all the way up to 120 degrees.\n\nThe game is not overly complex and should be easy to get into for casual (or competitive) first-person shooter players. Once the controls were mastered, I found both shark and diver movement to be fluid and responsive. Although linear, the submerged environments are beautiful and interesting to explore. Gameplay is tense and frantic; a single match in 'Blood and Gold' mode can last as short as 10 minutes. This is a game that is heavily dependent on situational awareness and fast reflexes. Sharks can see much further in the water than divers, and it's not unusual for a shark to simply lunge from the shadows, grab a diver, and then carry them off into the darkness while thrashing the unfortunate victim to death in their jaws. This is how sharks kill divers; once a diver has been grabbed, if you are playing as the shark, you must quickly shake your mouse sideways in order to rapidly deal damage. This gameplay mechanic may be a minor annoyance to some, so keep this in mind if you don't have a good mouse and/or surface on which to move it across.\n\nA small issue I have with this game is the leveling system and how it is tied into equipment/ability unlocks.\n\nIn order to unlock new equipment and abilities for both sharks and divers, you must 'level up' your Depth profile. Every level gained unlocks a new piece of equipment or ability. At first, equipment unlocks came fairly easily and rapidly; however, I am currently at level 9 (with 26 matches played) and it seems that level gains have slowed down dramatically. The leveling curve could be eased a bit to make the game less 'grindish' before seeing new equipment/abilities to play with.\n\nEDIT: I'm now level 12, and the experience required per level seems to be capped at 1,000 points, as it has remained the same for the past few levels. Therefore, it seems that the leveling curve has plateaued.)\n\nAdditionally, statistics (and therefore experience gained towards leveling your Depth profile) are only saved when you are playing with at least 1 other person, making single-player grinding with bots useless for the purpose of unlocking new equipment/abilities. You'll either have to go and play with random people on the public matchmaking service, or find a crew of regular friends to play with. I can't comment on the matchmaking service, as I only play this game co-operatively with friends or in single-player with bots when other people aren't available.\n\nThe AI bots themselves, although lacking the intelligence of a human player, are reasonably competent, both as sharks and as divers. AI sharks have a very aggressive personality and seemingly little sense of self-preservation, attacking divers both out in the open, and breaking through walls to attack within enclosed spaces. AI divers actively call out at the presence of sharks, upgrade their weapons as credits allow, retrieve treasure, have decent aim (some may argue that it is too good), do not wander too far from the S.T.E.V.E robot, and will even deploy consumables like flares (tested in 'Medium' AI difficulty). Overall, playing alone with bots is an enjoyable experience.\n\nI'm finding Depth to be a reasonably well-done and enjoyable FPS team-based horror/survival game. The game interface is functional, though I've noticed that Depth seems to load data from an external source in order to show the in-game help, rather than having it all in the game to begin with, which strikes me as odd. Additionally, the game launches other processes in order to operate its menu system, and seems to freeze for a while immediately at the conclusion of a match, just as the match statistics page appears. This goes away after a brief time, however, and the game has never crashed during gameplay, so this is just an odd, but not overly troublesome quirk.\n\nThere isn't quite enough content or depth of gameplay here for me to recommend this at full price, but I would certainly consider it while it's on sale. For 40% off, you can pick the game up for around the same as a full-priced copy of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, another team-based first-person shooter. While Depth doesn't offer more variety or complexity than Counter-Strike, it offers something a bit different for a smaller group of players, and it does it very well.\n\nThe Good:\n++ Graphically satisfying with plenty of adjustable options\n+ Smooth controls\n++ Excellent voice-chat functionality\n+ AI bots are actually good\n+ Interesting weapons and equipment\n+ Nice level design\n+++ Little to no lag, even on an extremely slow connection (8.5Kb/s to 25.6 Kb/s maximum data transfer rate)\n\nThe Bad:\n- - Experience and weapon/ability unlocks can only be obtained by playing online\n- The leveling curve can make getting new equipment/abilities a bit of a grind\n- No drop-in/drop-out ability for multi-player sessions\n- Only 6 maps and 2 game modes\n- Sharks mostly only get passive upgrades and little to nothing in the way of active abilities\n- Shark gameplay lacks depth; divers have plenty of options to work with\n\nConclusion:\nA competent team-based FPS/basic shark simulator with intense, fast-paced gameplay. If hunting divers as a shark, or being hunted by sharks as a diver while collecting treasure sounds interesting to you, then grab a friend or two and pick this up. If you have no one to play with, don't want to play with strangers, or only want to play single-player with bots, then you should probably give this game a miss. Depth was clearly designed with multi-player in mind, and while the single-player experience is workable and quite enjoyable, you'll never progress beyond the starting equipment if you don't have at least 1 other person to play with.","January 7, 2015","true","49.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The reason for this is that both divers and sharks share a finite number of respawns.\n\nOverall I highly recomend this game.

Albeit, it is extremely fun and engrossing for a relatively simple gameplay design. Similar to Left for Dead it is a cat and mouse game between four divers and two great white sharks. Both the divers and sharks can evolve to become better at killing. Divers are rewarded by finding treasure and by going on a killing spree. As a shark one evolves by continuing your kill streak, a key strategy is eating seals to regain lost health.\n\nWhat the game lacks is dynamic characters and a better evolution/perk system. As well, the gameplay with a few tweaks could be made much better. For example, every diver is identical in terms of gameplay. In my opinion the game would be better served with specific perks assigned to each of the divers, i.e. Carlos (the elder diver) has a penchant for survival or is adept at escape (i.e. a speed advantage to sprint away or a health boost.) Also, as a shark it would be fun to have a mode to be a Megalodon. This would in theory add more strategy for divers to kill or avoid the giant creature.\n\nRegardless of the game's short comings it is still enjoyable and is worth buying. If you are similar to me you will find enjoyment by either hunting divers or surviving and killing sharks. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys sharks, jaws, treasure hunting, and survival games. It could be better but it is still a solid game.","November 14, 2014","true","12.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Once you get the Hang of the gameplay and get your friends together you will have a good time. Playing random games will be the ususal ups and downs, some people are very praticed as playing shark and can easily wipe out a bad diver team. A good diver team can sleep through a game that has new players being sharks. Now that being said this game does not lack in tension. It does take a bit of hardware to run the game but my, so so, desktop is running it fine with low resolution and low settings... and the game still looks good.

I'd be the latter; I treat this game as unrealistic horror fiction just as much as I'd treat Jason as a horror element poorly portraying psychopaths. In layman's terms, this is a good thing.

Playing against a couple decent sharks is a nightmare. All of stages in a match--from openings, mid-game, late-game, and final escape--are interesting and are structured in such a way that the tension is always being ratcheted upwards, to the point where you'll wind up swimming through open water with zero cover, zero ammo, zero respawns left and while bleeding out, hoping you and your knife can dodge or stab the last two sharks long enough to make it back to the ship.\n\nIt usually isn't that dire, you'll probably have at least a clip left and maybe a few lives, but then again the sharks are nuts.\n\nGood sharks will bide their time, working together to make the divers paranoid and jumpy and distracted.\n\nGood sharks will bust through a wall and bite you.\n\nGood sharks will be able to swoop in an entrance, grab someone, and then drag them out into the abyss in one smooth motion that is over before you can even get a bead on them.\n\nIt's great!

Its formula is very simple but very, very fun: as a human, you must collect the treasure and kill sharks while fighting to stay live, while as the sharks your sole job is to stop the humans from collecting their treasure and leaving the dive successfully.\n\nIt features (as of this write-up) two game modes: Megalodon Hunt and Blood and Gold. Megalodon Hunt pits ONE human-controlled prehistoric super-shark against FIVE human-controlled divers. The "curse" of the Megalodon is bestowed upon the human who kills him, respawning them as the next Megalodon for the divers to try and take down. The goal of that game mode is to become the Megalodon as much as you can and win, though if you're not a fan of playing as sharks like myself you'll just have fun upgrading the weapons and slaying the shark instead of actually becoming him. In classic mode, Blood and Gold, FOUR divers descend upon the wrecks and reefs against TWO sharks whose job is to kill you and stop you from taking the loot away at the end of the game. It's hectic, crazy, fast, and scary all at the same time. Divers can upgrade weapon types, buy sonar beacons and mines, and trap sharks with netguns, while the sharks choose one of three classes - Tiger shark, Great white shark, or Mako shark - and speed their jaws of fury toward any and all divers in sight in hopes of killing them and stopping their progress and escape. Both modes are amazingly fun, though the classic Blood and Gold is arguably the more fun of the two, especially with friends.\n\nPROS:\n+ Co-op - you and five other friends via the lobby system. Though it doesn't necessarily use dedicated servers the way, say, Killing Floor does, it doesn't hamper the gameplay experience at any time.\n+ Nice, PC-centric features - Depth of field, FOV slider, custom input and controls, and a detailed layout make this a well-done feature set. Mouse acceleration is there but off by default which is a nice touch, and the inclusion of an FOV slider is something that even a lot of AAA developers don't do these days.\n+ This game makes playing as a human or a shark equally viable - both player types have equal counters to the other type. Playing as humans doesn't mean you'll automatically lose to the faster and more powerful sharks, while playing as a shark doesn't guarantee you a win just because you can eat a human in 2 seconds. Balance is definitely part of this game.\n+ Unreal Engine 3 - some developers are super lazy with it, but these guys were not. Everything about it makes it seem very well-done and tailored for the PC. Movement, fluidity, and gameplay are all top notch while looking beautiful and atmospheric, both in good and scary ways.\n+ Free updates - since release, not too long ago, the developers released the new shark types and new game mode, all for free. This is a great practice and builds a great reputation for them within the community of those who play their game. Doing things like that should be more common and should be applauded.\n+ Great audio - listen well, as you'll be able to hear the water swishing around in any direction indicating where a shark may be coming from. The faster they swim, the louder the water's sounds. The heartbeat sound you hear getting more frequent indicates the sharks are extremely close and about to attack, while hearing nothing is an anxious sigh of release because you at least know that for a fraction of a second you're not super close to a shark.\n\nCONS:\n- The Mako shark - the fastest of the three shark types in this game, seems a little unbalanced with the rest of the playable types. His on-screen movement as seen from a diver is almost too fast and it will often appear as if you weren't even being looked at but were grabbed by one somehow. Either player-side server problems are the issue or its movement is buggy but the Mako seems a little too strong in that regard despite being very easy to kill if netted and dealt with properly. It's an on-going struggle to compete against them.\n- Bombs - sometimes do not explode even when Tiger and Great White sharks are nearby them, while other times they seemingly go off because a shark came within 10 feet of one and will sometimes kill you along with the shark in the blast. Again, could be a user-specific experience but it happens to some folks and I've seen that in-game as well.\n- Shortage of maps - the game does come with an SDK and modding capability so in that regard there is the ability for modders to bring more maps to the game, but I don't know how they'd be implemented. Do developers need to approve them to allow them to be played without a server browser? Right now there are few maps and though the gameplay is varied the map choices are not. More maps is always better. I'm sure this will be addressed in the near future though.\n- Slightly small community - oftentimes you will find yourself ending a game, searching for a new one, and seeing one or two of the same folks you just played with. Changing search parameters may change that and it isn't a major point of concern, but it's worth noting that sometimes you'll find "shark-♥♥♥♥♥s" and then search for another game only to end up with them again, whether you wanted to play against them or not.\n\nDepth is a great game so far though. The developers seem to genuinely care for their game and their updates have been awesome and useful, and new content so far has been free. The game can probably run on older hardware and still get you a good experience, too. It's fun, it's pretty well-balanced, and it's very atmospheric. The visual and audio cues mentioned earlier are great in this game and seriously almost rival the quality of DICE's audio in their Battlefield games. It's best to play with friends for all the beneficial reasons of doing so, but can be played by yourself or in a bot game where all the others are AI and you can set up your own game. Get used to paranoia, cause you'll be experiencing it frequently in this game. It's visceral and scary while being fun and sometimes funny. Definitely worth its full asking price but if you find it on sale it's a total steal.\n\ngg shrimp\ngood luck, have fin","January 17, 2015","true","42.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

This is the game Evolve wanted to be, but fell short of.\n\nGreat aspects:\n-Very tense environment. You are always on edge worrying that a shark might pop out and eat you at any moment.\n-The main mode has 2 sharks, which is a much better balance that a single monster. This allows for some amount of strategy and keeps the divers from being able to just surround and gang up on a shark.\n-Balancing between divers and sharks is really well done. While playing very different, neither feels like it has the advantage.\n-It's really really fun to be a shark. Stalking your prey and then bursting through a wall to chomp one in half is a blast. It was a really nice touch to have the shark player shake the mouse violently when they bite down on a diver to kill them. Seems like a small thing, but really makes you feel ferocious.\n\nHonestly, the biggest problem with this game is getting a full lobby of players.

But don't go on my word alone check out some gameplay videos to see if its for you.\n\nI had a blast I'd give it a 8/10","November 2, 2015","true","3.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

After a while you will likely lose all interest in mp and choose some other game. I played a free weekend and while it was fun, it was not a blast to play it. The weekend ended and it's still not on my wishlist.\n\n2) All unlockables,a re just for that specific match. I get why it's like that, but personally I find it rather upsetting. Not annoying. If there were more weapons, consumables, gadgets it would be more fun, as long as once unlocked, it's forever with your character. Monthly new gadgets, skins, evolve options for sharks, weapons, would be a great thing to keep me in the game. And of course they have to be free DLCs.\n\n3)Not enough female characters. You see, I like staring at my female character's... ah... parts so it's a cons for me. I know many people are homos nowadays, but there are still some who don't stray from Nature's path.\n\nIf there will ever be a Depth part 2, it will have to provide more fun to players, more content, more modes perhaps, where going for gold is not the only option. Or maybe more players on 1 map. Anything done correctly could work. But if it will follow the same path as this game, the same thing is going to happen with a player base.","July 13, 2015","true","13.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","10","16","5","3"

The visuals, pace, and particularly the sound really make it exciting to play. The sharks are fast, powerful, and their abilities are such that if divers aren't on top of things the two sharks will decimate them. It's quite something when the guy next to you is swept off into the murky water beyond your vision, with a pretty horrific underwater scream.\n\nThe game also runs very well, with matchmaking working right out of the gate with no issues. In short, it's a fun asymmetrical multiplayer game (2 sharks versus 4 divers). Teamwork on both sides is pretty important, but particularly for the divers. Gameplay is simple but as people get more unlocks and more skilled it may change.\n\nDespite this, I feel as though varied objectives could make things more interesting (repair STEVE, or mark a path for him... something other than camp an area and wait for the indicator to reach 100%). It is for this reason that I think $25 is a little much, but I recommend it anyways as it is something different, entertaining, and well made.","November 6, 2014","true","10.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Both teams get 30 respawns and the teams are 4 divers and 2 sharks.\n\nThe objective of the match is to either eliminate the enemy team or get S.T.E.V.E. to all treasure locations and then out of the water.  The sharks only have one objective and that is to eliminate all divers, there are no alternative ways for the sharks to win, they only have the one choice, stop the divers.  I have heard that S.T.E.V.E. can be destroyed by the sharks and that will win them the match but I have yet to see that victory, I have only witnessed the sharks winning by eliminating the divers.  The divers getting two choices of victory give them the hand up in the game seeing how they just have to play defense, once S.T.E.V.E. stops at a location to open a safe full of treasure the divers must set up quickly to be prepared to kill any shark that attempts to obtain a few kills.  The most dangerous point for the divers is when S.T.E.V.E. is moving from location to location because it puts them in open water where the sharks have the advantage seeing how the divers can not move their backs to walls.  If the divers are able to get S.T.E.V.E. to all locations and then out of the water without losing their lives or eliminating all the sharks then they will instantly win.\n\nAll in all it is a very enjoyable game and can have its scares from time to time.  I believe that anyone can enjoy this game and if played with mates can have a very enjoyable gaming session.  There is public matchmaking for those who do not have mates online to play the game with but I feel playing the game with mates is definitely the way to be playing the game.\n\nIn conclusion this game is a great TDM based game but doesnt have all that much replay value if not playing with mates, I dont feel anyone will get too much enjoyment out of it just palying with randoms over and over again as I usually enjoy doing that back in the day with Call of Duty.  This game however I lost interest in playing with randoms very quickly but I am very eager to play this game with friends.  Even with that said it is a great game and I definitely recommend it as a good TDM style game.","December 2, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sounds easy? Well guess what? Sharks are trying to stop this mission either by killing all of the divers or destroying S.T.E.V.E. As shark close in your heartbeat gets faster and faster (that actually happens in the game) and then THEY STRIKE! The only way to escape the sharks once they have you in there jaws is by killing them. There are not that many weapons but there isen't to little. Also considering the game has been out for 8 months and is getting updated im sure there will be alot more weapons to be found later on. There are a decent amount of "perks" or "attachments" you can add to your weapons such as poison or a tracking device that make each weapon unique. And finally the items. There are plenty of them that each provide a strategic purpose. Mines explode when touched by sharks (or divers in some cases) medical kits heal you and shark shields ruin a sharks vision (there are more items to be found that I am not mentioning). And that concludes the diver.\n\nAs a shark you are a beast. You charge into a diver catching it in your jaws while shaking the mouse to rip them apart. It is awesome. There is a variety of sharks to choose from each with there own stats abillity and strategies. The more divers you kill the more evolution points you get. There are evolutions such as: you regenerate health, you sprint/swim faster, or one that makes your fins sharp damaging divers that get caught in them. Sharks movement and lunges are so smooth. It takes on or two games to get used to the controls (and considering your a shark thats pretty decent). Might I add the animation for swiming looks beautiful! And that concludes the shark.\n\nThe gameplay in this gem is not like any other... Well other than left4dead. I mean if you really think about it there is alot of teamwork involved to win this game (like left4dead). There is more teamwork involved with the divers (as it is impossible to play without it) I mean if all divers split up to look for treasure themselves a shark could snag them and take them away. Most sharks go solo and it is certainly possible. But I have seen amazing teamwork with sharks that basically wins games (these are mostly friends playing and communicating with eachother). Infact playing this game with friends is alot more fun you can create a lobby with your friends playing as divers or sharks and owning the other team wih your amazing teamwork. An amazing addition to the FPS genre you should definetly pick it up if you are getting tired of all the call of duty sequels or if you just love FPS games in general.\n\nThis concludes my review.","June 14, 2015","true","49.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I was expecting sharks to trounce the divers every single time, yet if they have any semblance of how they should play, can pose a significant challenge. High replayability, quick to find matches (No longer than 0-3 minutes, for either faction, most of the time it's less than 30 seconds) and they released their game tools for custom made maps and mods, so when that takes a bigger role in the game, replayability should NOT be an issue, because where there are new maps, there are new ways to kill or be killed.

I have notice at times it takes a little to get into a game, but its rare for me tho.\n\n-Easy to learn and hard to master. I say this because lots of people know how to play the game but they don't play the game the right way to win at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlashtaCross/recommended/274940/","SlashtaCross","SlashtaCross","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlashtaCross/","84 products in account","Depth is an amazing game in my opinion!  I'm not much of a gamer but this game has me "Hooked", pun intended.  Now I'm not a fan of Call of Duty or, ummm, Idk the other games that are created where people shoot other people.  It got old after killing so many hookers on GTA ya know?  I wanted more in my life.  I wanted to be someone...someday...somehow, you know.  Well i'm still no one but this game has given me a great idea of starting a YouTube channel and has got some decent attention on it so far!  The game is growing at a very nice rate.  When I first had this game I would only play the same 5 people match after match after match.  Don't get me wrong that got boring quick.  Now it's not such a problem.  You see new faces everyday and even every match.  I know people say that Leaderboard players wreck everyone but its simply not true.  They can be demolished just as easy as the next guy (kinda).  If you aren't sure you're ready to join the battles against real people then you can always go to a bot match.  You can even select the difficulty of the bots.  This is a wonderful way to practice, try new strategies and builds, and will have you getting good in no time.  Being a shark is something so majestically beautiful that there aren't even words to describe the feeling you get when ripping a leaderboard player apart and watching him disconnect.  Not gonna name any names or anything cough cough and also when being a diver there is still no words that can describe stabbing a Great White in the face until death becomes upon him!  With that all being said some things have been added to the game that made it cooler but also less interesting.  There was an update that added abilities to the sharks.  These abilities fit the certain species of the shark well.  Great Whites became tankier, Tiger Sharks turn Invisible, Makos mark prey, HammerHeads gain stamina from faceplanting walls.  Thats all fine and dandy but they added this thing where once the divers are behind the shark team by 8 lives, the Robot S.t.e.v.e. automatically drops these things known as Shark Shields.  A shark shield hides all of the players inside it.  Now experienced leadboard diver players have the upper hand when I shark and wreck.  They can swim into the open(depending on location) and take me out without me seeing them at all.  Then when I can take out the shield, steve or another player can instantly drop another one until steve auto drops more. So you are basically fighting blind :(.  I much preferred the pre updated version.  I had no problem playing as diver or shark before but now I have problems with both.  When I shark the divers get auto shields and when I dive I don't get auto shields because I keep up with the shark lives.  Taking shots at all my leaderboard players out there, come at me bros xD.  Still with those two big boo boos I really think this game is great and is worth the price and who  knows maybe someday they will correct some of these issues.","September 30, 2015","true","343.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The lighting is fantastic and the maps are great. As a diver everything is dark and sound is a big thing I found to hear shark breaking through ruined walls etc. Its heart pumping and a serious challenge to survive unless you really watch each others backs and use your equipment well. As a shark you watch the group looking for anyone to stray just far enough away that you can pick up an easy kill. When you grab a diver you shake the mouse rapidly to increase the damage you are doing which feels great!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pankin/recommended/274940/","pankin","Closet Pankin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pankin/","362 products in account","If you're interested in Depth, I'd strongly recommend picking it up. It features a fast matchmaking system in the main menu not unlike CS:GO's and lets you pick what side you'd rather play as (or you don't mind either one), shark or diver.\n\n\nBlood and Gold is a gamemode that most people would rather play in which both sides - sharks and divers - have 30 lives shared with their team. Divers have to escort a robot, S.T.E.V.E., through the map as it saws through safes and then looping back towards its spawn. Divers can pick up loose treasure worth $50 a piece in order to afford more advanced gear to fend off sharks - the only catch (haha) is that to pick up most treasure, you either have to hang back as your team and S.T.E.V.E push forward, or move away from the safe STEVE is cracking into dark, unexplored and very possibly dangerous areas to pick it up. In order for the treasure to go towards your funds, you have to return it to S.T.E.V.E. So if you head off alone to score the big bucks, there's a good chance you won't be coming back.\n\nCommunication is vital to survival - most often, the team that communicates with one another is the team that wins.\n\nBoth sides are very fun to play as. Each round has six players - four divers and two sharks. The divers are weaker, slower, and cannot see very well in the dark. Your vision is mostly limited to what little natural lighting there is, your flashlight, and other deployable lights such as flares or sensor beacons. The divers do have a few notable advantages, however, that any diver AND shark should consider - you have ranged weaponry that is surprisingly effective, and whenever a shark is nearby, you start to hear a heartbeat. As the shark gets closer, your heart beats much faster. All of this brilliantly leads to an exhilarating experience in which the environment is both dark or a very red tint (flares and red lights), and as danger approaches, your heart beats much faster as a shark intent on carrying you away from your team in its maw prepares to attack you or your companions.\n\nNow, as it is with all asymmetrical team-based games, playing as a shark is a very different experience. To start, there's only two of you and four of them, and even divers who don't speak a word to one another stick together more often than not.\nYou can play as one of three species of shark at the moment - a great white, a powerhouse with high health but the speed and stamina of a satiated obese man at McDonalds, a tiger who's got medium speed, power, and stamina and natural camoflauge or my personal favorite, the Mako, who has VERY low health but is faster and more agile than a BFB Scout with a neon pink unusual who spams binds after every kill. The mako is pretty difficult to master but tends to be the shark of choice for many players, myself included. To play as a mako, it's important to plan your attacks and make sure you're as far away from everyone's guns as possible, and you kill the dude you're chomping as soon as possible. That knife hurts, man. Also if you're that scout, ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nPlaying as a shark is a very tactical experience to say the least, and unless you're playing as a Great White, you won't be able to just tank damage while charging into the fray. Oh, did I mention you can see in the dark? Because you can see in the dark.\nAs a shark, you will consistently 'ping' the environment by sending out a sonic wave that highlights notable things in the environment - S.T.E.V.E. is always highlighted in gold, the divers, when pinged, are highlighted in red, and seals in a light purple. When you're close enough to the divers or a seal, though, they will always be highlighted, allowing you to prepare your attack without being blindsided... well, TOO blindsided. It's not like divers can set mines or anything.\nAs a shark, you can left click to make a short dart forward or right click to make a longer lunge, depleting your stamina as you do so. By lunging at a piece of equipment (sonar, shields, etc.) you destroy it, and if you lunge at and hit a diver, you grab them in your jaws. To damage the diver, you shake your mouse faster than if you were holding baby Hitler. While you're grabbing a diver, however, you're also highlighted on any diver's screen and the diver you're trying to devour is furiously stabbing you in your shark face - so it's not a good idea to do this in full view of everybody (though you can do that for an achievement). It's a good idea to ambush divers and carry them away from any help they could receive. You can get tagged and highlighted, however, if you're hit by a tagging round, or detected by enemy sonar. In these events, either bail or go all in. Everyone can see you now, even in pitch black.\nYou earn points to spend on 'evolving' or upgrading your shark via killing divers. Each kill will get you one point to spend, and you always start the game with one point to either save or spend on one of the two starting abilities. I won't say what abilities are good and what are bad - they're all dependent on personal preference and playstyle. Eat seals to heal, by the way.\n\nOverall it's a pretty good game.","January 8, 2015","true","34.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course that was followed by my thoughts that the sharks would absolutely destroy the divers with little to no competition. After watching a few gameplays, and eyeing it for weeks, I decided to pick it up since it went 33% off. My assumptions could not have been more wrong.\n\nThe game is just stupidly fun, and one of the best things about it is that no negative stats are tracked. The only thing it watches for are points/income, kills, and assists. This is a HUGE relief as anyone worrying about K/D or the sort will have nothing to worry about. This makes it great for both casual and competitive(generally speaking, not just about this game)to enjoy it to the fullest. The lobbies fill quickly, the matchmaking is good, with a very good variety of options covering pretty much anything you'd want to adjust. Maps, matchmaking locations, Diver/Shark select(You can choose either.)\n\nLet's talk gameplay though. I was worried that it would be extremely difficult to control and lose my interest, because most underwater combat anythings just don't work well. "The infamous water level," if you will.That's not the case at all. The controls are simple, tight, and extremely responsive. Once you get the hang of it, while you will probably experience a few hiccups due to the nature of the arenas, both sides are easy and fun to control.\n\nThere is so much I want to write, but I'll leave it at this. This game will take your worries, and fears and throw them deep into the ocean to get devoured by sharks. The sheer joy you get from shaking your mouse to simulate tearing people apart is just amazing. I highly recommend this game, and have already gifted a few copies to friends who also loved it.\n\nGet. This. Game. Especally if the devs continue to support it. If we continue to see content drops I don't think I'll ever stop playing this game.","December 30, 2014","true","41.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warhawk7/recommended/274940/","warhawk7","[TMC]Warhawk(510)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warhawk7/","457 products in account","From the briny deep comes Depth, an asymmetrical multiplayer game that pits two teams against each other in the form of Sharks Vs Divers. In case you are wondering, yes, it is as exciting and terrifying as it sounds. Prepare to soil your wetsuit many times over; but don’t worry, that brown water will quickly turn red as the sharks thrash your frail body from side to side.\n\nDepth features two modes and 6 maps. At first glance seems like there isn’t enough game there to justify the pricetag. However, after playing it for several hours I can say that the value is definately there.\n\nGame Mode 1: Blood and Gold The main game mode is called “Blood and Gold” and has a team of 4 divers that escort an automated submarine called S.T.E.V.E. while fending off the sharks. Both teams have a pre-determined number of respawns that is shared among each team, if either team depletes all of their respawns, they lose the round.\n\nIn “Blood and Gold” S.T.E.V.E. automatically goes about his route, stopping at predefined stations where he cracks into underwater safes. While this is happening each diver is able to gather loose treasure from the seafloor which them extra points and allows individual divers to use these points to purchase upgraded weapons and equipment during the match. As a diver, you are generally better off staying near S.T.E.V.E. as venturing too far afield leaves you vulnerable to attack. After S.T.E.V.E. cracks all of the safes, he returns to the home ship, and if there are any divers still alive at this point, they win the round.\n\nThe shark team consists of only two sharks with the simple mission: feast on the flesh of the opposing team. There are a number of different types of sharks to choose from, each with different pros and cons.  As mentioned before, Sharks have various abilities to unlock such as different ways to make tracking prey easier. By default all sharks have a limited sonar ability as well as a surge ability that allows them to lunge forward toward prey for a limited distance.\n\nSharks generally can’t sustain much damage and must rely on surprise and the concealment that the limited visibility of the oceans provide.  Guerrilla warfare typically works best, where sharks dart in and out of the driver area, snatching targets of opportunity and darting away as quickly as possible. Another effective strategy is to circle the periphery just out of visible range of the divers. Here you can pick off divers that wander too far from their friends.  Sharks can also break through certain walls, allowing for some surprise cool-aid man moments.\n\nOnce latched onto a diver the player can shake the mouse back and fourth. The amount of vigor you put into your mouse shaking determines the speed in which you tear the diver in half. Not only is this is creative mechanic, it’s also extremely satisfying.\n\nGame Mode 2: Megalodon HuntThe second game mode is called Megalodon Hunt and starts out with 4 players as divers and one player as an extra large Megalodon shark.  The 4 divers can gather loot off the seafloor; as they gather loot their primary weapon automatically upgrades itself based on the amount of loot they are able to acquire.  The goal of the Megalodon is, as you’d expect, to make snacks out of as many divers as possible. Once a diver manages to kill the megalodon, that diver spawns as the Megalodon. This continues until the total amount of diver spawns is depleted.\n\nEach match you play contributes points to your overall career progression, which unlocks new diver weapons and shark abilities as you level up.\n\nHigh Points:While playing as a shark is good fun, and probably the type most will want to play as, the asymmetrical layout of the teams means you will likely end up playing as a diver most often. As a diver, the underwater setting of the game adds a whole new dimension to the genre because the player can be attacked from any angle. Divers will hear a heartbeat sound that will increase in pace as sharks get closer, it has the same feeling of the Jaws soundtrack. The reduced visibility of being underwater means you never know what direction the shark attacks will come from, adding to the fear factor. Levels are designed in such as way so that divers are always vulnerable from multiple angles in just about any area they attempt to hide in. All of these factors come together to create a constant sense of vulnerability and impending doom… which is exactly what you want in a game featuring sharks.\n\nDepth is great fun to play on pub server, but where this game really has the potential to shine is if you can get a group of friends playing it together, especially in a LAN party environment.\n\nThe Bottom Line - Value Proposition: Is this game worth the 25 dollar asking price?\n\nAs stated earlier, normally a multiplayer only game with so few game modes and maps would be cause for concern. On paper, looking at what the game has to offer, I would expect a price more in the 20 dollar range. However, after playing the game and experiencing how unique and fun it is, I have to say that it is worth the 25 dollar price tag and you should definitely pick this game up.","December 28, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was extremely difficult, and definitly does not hand hold players. Your thrown into the game, no tutorial, and you have to figure out how to play on your own. Do not get this game if your looking for an easy game to play. The controls are a little floaty, and are difficult to master. The multiplayer is enjoyable, but it lags pretty badly depending on where you are. You need a pretty strong wifi to master, or otherwise if a fight gets to intense, the whole screen will freeze, and when it catches up, you might find yourself in the mouth of a shark. Its not scary. Don't buy this game if your expecting a horror game. True, it can be startling when a shark suddenly snatches you out of the darkness of the deep. But its not a horror game. Its game mechanics are similar to evolve. You may expect the shark to be overpowered. This is not the case. You never feel like you can destroy all the divers, and rip them to shreds. Instead, you can kill one diver, and then, all the other divers work togeather to kill you all at once. Playing as the diver is much more difficult, because I personally found it difficult to aim and shoot, and occasionally, a bullet would hit a shark, and seem to do no damage.\nHowever, all this being said, I still throughly enjoyed the game. The game is a learning process. At first, you will die at every turn. I suggest playing on single player for a while, and hone your skills. You will be decimated on your first online match. Thats ok. You haven't mastered the game yet. Keep at it, and you will get better. As you level up, more guns will become available, and slowly, you will become braver and braver, willing to swim furthur and furthur away from the pack to get the golden treasure. I recommend the game, but expect a challenge. Don't expect it to be cake. You will need to work for the game, and you will be rewarded.\nRating on the Eternity Scale: 8.5 out of 10","July 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls for the shark are in third person and wonderfully smooth giving you complete control over your enviroment and manouverabilty. The the sharks are divided into classes with apporiate stats for species as well as an evolutionary tree with 16 different perks you upgrade with points aquired through diver kills. The cat and mouse feel of this game is guided through large and uniquely diverse maps with the divers having to escort a unmanned aquatic bot named S.T.E.V.E. to multiple treasure locations, as well as collecting loose treasure on the sea floor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foreverblu/recommended/274940/","foreverblu","Foreverblu~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foreverblu/","125 products in account","Depth is a Multiplayer asymmetric PVP game, a fight to the death between Sharks and Divers. Each match is short, engaging, and surprisingly not repetitive. Within this game, the Divers will accompany there friend S.T.E.V.E the robot down into the ocean in search of the riches, only to disturb the very ocean the Sharks live in, who react (very) aggressively.\n\nThe PVP System is very fluid, the servers optimal, with 11+ maps spread over 3 game modes. In the base Blood and Gold Game, Divers go down into a wreck of a city or ship and attempt to find treasures and protect S.T.E.V.E whilst the Sharks try to hinder and kill the Divers. Each game starts with 2 Sharks against 4 Divers, each side having a shared 24 life pool. The game is terribly balanced, with an average life expectancy of a shark being one kill for one death, and as the game drags on, the Divers have the option of purchasing new gear, weapons and consumables in their fight against the Sharks. Meanwhile, the Sharks have the ability to upgrade their genetics, evolving and adapting to the scenario.\n\nIn terms of content, the player unlocks more and more weapons, upgrades for weapons and shark evolutions throughout playing, with each level up giving new options for the players. The common humor and comedy within the game adds to the chilled yet intense and thrilling atmosphere, and the only available In-Game Purchases are skins for sharks or weapons, making it entirely skill-based. There are currently 6 sharks available(each with its own active ability) and around 8 weapons available. The choice within the game of picking this weapon or this one depends entirely on the ability of the Sharks, which makes each weapon equal and useful in their own way, either dealing with pesky and fast sharks or a single shot high damage weapon for slower more tough sharks. The sharks themselves have expansive evolution trees, and could base their decisions off of the divers placing too many mines, or putting too many attachments to their weapons.\n\nThe game has a great skill learning curve, with Sharks being slightly harder to use than humans. The player base is pretty good, with an average of 10 seconds to 30 seconds if you are a diver and around 1 min to 2 min if you want to be a shark(At least, in my regions). In summary, this game is great, definitely buy it, and its humor, whether in the form of the speeches the captain makes, the updates to the game or its in-game chat potential make it a one-of-a-kind deathmatch arena.","January 7","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're in open water you are a free kill, if you are near an opening with another opening on the other side of the room, you're a free kill. Your only chance of survival is killing the Shoork before it gets to you (Unlikely, they travel at Mach 3), or your team mates killing the Shoork before it eats you. Thankful all weapons hit hard and Shoorks are fragile.\n\nFor Sharks it is Hunt and Destroy. 2 Sharks that are fast, deadly and can sense prey through walls, but they are weak. A Shoork who is not moving is a dead Shoork, a Shoork with empty stamina is a dead Shoork. Thankful all Shoorks are lightning fast (This would be what ^ Heart Problems ^ was refering to) and can kill with ease. Their are (Currently) 5 Sharks; Great White (Tank), Mako (Sniper/Assassine), Tiger (Ghost), Hammerhead (Heavy) and Threasher (Crowd Control).\n\nThe game feels fresh and fun. There are only two gamemodes and a handfull of maps (8 I think?). No Single Player (Well, you could play a game solo with bots). Performace is generally good. Graphics are "okay". Controls are good.\nThe game has a small community, you will find games, but you will notice you will play with people you've played with before often.

I fell this game could easily beat out alot of hyped AAA titles that have come out in the last few years with a little more work. The game is not easy by anymeans for the divers or the sharks but once you get the feel of how the game works and what weapons, sharks, & evolutions to get the game does get alot more forgiving. The main thing in the game is to be constantly aware & work together. That god-damn heart beat sure as hell does the trick creating more tension adding to the desolation of already being under the Ocean.","October 27, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was extremely difficult, and definitly does not hand hold players. Your thrown into the game, no tutorial, and you have to figure out how to play on your own. Do not get this game if your looking for an easy game to play. The controls are a little floaty, and are difficult to master. The multiplayer is enjoyable, but it lags pretty badly depending on where you are. You need a pretty strong wifi to master, or otherwise if a fight gets to intense, the whole screen will freeze, and when it catches up, you might find yourself in the mouth of a shark. Its not scary. Don't buy this game if your expecting a horror game. True, it can be startling when a shark suddenly snatches you out of the darkness of the deep. But its not a horror game. Its game mechanics are similar to evolve. You may expect the shark to be overpowered. This is not the case. You never feel like you can destroy all the divers, and rip them to shreds. Instead, you can kill one diver, and then, all the other divers work togeather to kill you all at once. Playing as the diver is much more difficult, because I personally found it difficult to aim and shoot, and occasionally, a bullet would hit a shark, and seem to do no damage.\nHowever, all this being said, I still throughly enjoyed the game. The game is a learning process. At first, you will die at every turn. I suggest playing on single player for a while, and hone your skills. You will be decimated on your first online match. Thats ok. You haven't mastered the game yet. Keep at it, and you will get better. As you level up, more guns will become available, and slowly, you will become braver and braver, willing to swim furthur and furthur away from the pack to get the golden treasure. I recommend the game, but expect a challenge. Don't expect it to be cake. You will need to work for the game, and you will be rewarded.\nRating on the Eternity Scale: 8.5 out of 10","July 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This game gives you that constant edge of your seat feelz as a diver being hunted, but also gives you the abilty to strike back against your would be predators with a variety of weapons tools and modifications for them. Playing the shark is just as rewarding as you silently cruise the ocean stalking your prey. The controls for the shark are in third person and wonderfully smooth giving you complete control over your enviroment and manouverabilty. The the sharks are divided into classes with apporiate stats for species as well as an evolutionary tree with 16 different perks you upgrade with points aquired through diver kills. The cat and mouse feel of this game is guided through large and uniquely diverse maps with the divers having to escort a unmanned aquatic bot named S.T.E.V.E. to multiple treasure locations, as well as collecting loose treasure on the sea floor.

You have the option of CHOOSING to play a SHARK without fear of being AUTO BALANCED on your team. Not up for being a shark? Same thing. You have the options of choosing a specific class to play or random, no matter your mood. This I enjoy greatly. It's nice to play a pvp with options and lack of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto-balance JUST WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO A CLASS YOU ENJOY. and I'm pretty sure anyone who has played some other animals vs people pvp game can empathize. >_>\n\nNow, onto the points.\n\nFantastic soundtrack, good quality with eerie undertones that make you on edge. Sounds are so important to this game, for shark and diver alike. What's around the corner? Friend or foe? Murky water and can't hear something coming up? Better listen for it, because that's your only hint.\n\nThe game controls are fairly simple, easy to learn but difficult to master depending on your reaction time. Once you get good at this game though, you get /good/. There are a ton of fantastic players out there too!\n\nModels are top notch and the animations blew me out of the water(Pun intended). The shark's scarred detail wiggle my inner 3D modeler, there's so much detail, even down to the "floating" jaw in the skull. Fantastic. The enviornment is one I wish I could kick back and explore in single player or with a friend, simply because it's so beautiful and breath taking(just don't drown), it's something I've always hoped I would see; underwater shark exploration. However, this is a pvp game and that's just fanciful dreaming! How far out does the map exactly go? I have no clue. Too busy eating divers to pay attention.\n\nNow, onto the single downside...\n\nSometimes there are hackers, sometimes there are pissbabies, sometimes there's bad apples, but that's to be expected in ANY pvp game. Take it leisurely, taking in the scenery, sharpen your skills, or just beat some AI divers to a pulp if you need to. It's not the games fault for the community, and over-all they are amazing people. I'd like to see more shark variants in the future, but please don't make a great game ruined by DLC. You guys have something no other PVP game does yet, and you did it well.\n\n10/10 - Say farewell and adieu to your fair spanish ladies.","May 17, 2015","true","87.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As the divers, things become tense when you start hearing the heartbeats that indicate that a shark is nearby.  You have to juggle your base instinct to survive with the greed to collect the golden treasures littered along the watery depths.\n\nAnd the sharks are just as exciting.  By the nature of how the game is played, you'll always be outnumbered, but each shark has its own distinct trait that makes them dangerous, whether that means they're quick and stealthy, having the ability to turn the walls into death traps, or just overall being beefy and taking whatever hits the divers throw at them.\n\nGame tend to be fairly quick-paced.  With friends, it's extremely entertaining.  I have to admit that there are certain sharks that, once divers reach a certain point with their weapons, become ineffective at stopping the treasure hunters.   But overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with this purchase and look forward diving into it (hohoho) for some time.","April 21, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Depth is set 10 months before the events of Sharknado take place as a team of contractor divers scour the seabed for the legendary treasure chest containing a spare copy of Sander's illusively secret KFC recipe. In the midst of it all, the Sharks own territory is trespassed by the fumbling and ignorant humans. Offended by this, Queen Jaws summons a frenzy of sharks to defend their territory before mankind's industrial machine reduces the seabed to nothing.\n\nIn under a week, an oil tanker suffers an accident at sea and loses over 2 billion dollars worth of oil. The marine life in the area perish and Queen Jaws becomes enraged with anger. Confident she can deter and ward off further human intervention, Queen Jaws assembles crack shark teams to rapidly intercept diver teams below the surface. Queen Jaws also orders random beach attacks at the many beach sites around the world as a means of spreading fear and terror.\n\nUnfortunately for Queen Jaws, her plans begin to fail. More and more diver teams are successfully looting the seabed in search for the illusive Sander's secret recipe. Within a week prior of Sharknado, Queen Jaws assembles her remaining frenzy of sharks and rallies them at her designated staging base, just hundreds of metres under the freak hurricane that is about to destroy Los Angeles, and enact his final plan for vengeance against an ignorant and merciless foe...mankind.\n\nIf you're into sharks or scuba diving, this game is for you. Every Scuba Diver should pack this game into his waterproof laptop for those long working days thousands of meters under the ocean to kill some time. Great game with a simple learning curve.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foreverblu/recommended/274940/","foreverblu","Foreverblu~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foreverblu/","125 products in account","Depth is a Multiplayer asymmetric PVP game, a fight to the death between Sharks and Divers. Each match is short, engaging, and surprisingly not repetitive. Within this game, the Divers will accompany there friend S.T.E.V.E the robot down into the ocean in search of the riches, only to disturb the very ocean the Sharks live in, who react (very) aggressively.\n\nThe PVP System is very fluid, the servers optimal, with 11+ maps spread over 3 game modes. In the base Blood and Gold Game, Divers go down into a wreck of a city or ship and attempt to find treasures and protect S.T.E.V.E whilst the Sharks try to hinder and kill the Divers. Each game starts with 2 Sharks against 4 Divers, each side having a shared 24 life pool. The game is terribly balanced, with an average life expectancy of a shark being one kill for one death, and as the game drags on, the Divers have the option of purchasing new gear, weapons and consumables in their fight against the Sharks. Meanwhile, the Sharks have the ability to upgrade their genetics, evolving and adapting to the scenario.\n\nIn terms of content, the player unlocks more and more weapons, upgrades for weapons and shark evolutions throughout playing, with each level up giving new options for the players. The common humor and comedy within the game adds to the chilled yet intense and thrilling atmosphere, and the only available In-Game Purchases are skins for sharks or weapons, making it entirely skill-based. There are currently 6 sharks available(each with its own active ability) and around 8 weapons available. The choice within the game of picking this weapon or this one depends entirely on the ability of the Sharks, which makes each weapon equal and useful in their own way, either dealing with pesky and fast sharks or a single shot high damage weapon for slower more tough sharks. The sharks themselves have expansive evolution trees, and could base their decisions off of the divers placing too many mines, or putting too many attachments to their weapons.\n\nThe game has a great skill learning curve, with Sharks being slightly harder to use than humans. The player base is pretty good, with an average of 10 seconds to 30 seconds if you are a diver and around 1 min to 2 min if you want to be a shark(At least, in my regions). In summary, this game is great, definitely buy it, and its humor, whether in the form of the speeches the captain makes, the updates to the game or its in-game chat potential make it a one-of-a-kind deathmatch arena.","January 7","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

One Team is two sharks checking out their local supermarket while the other team is four Divers plundering dat pirate booty all night long. Alternetive game modes exist, such as Hide and Seek, or Meglodon Hunt, where one player is a supermassive shark during Snack time.\n\nIf you have a group of 6 players, you can utilize match Making to find an empty server and all play together. I strongly recommend playing with VOIP over a 3rd party program like Team-Speak.

Lets be honest, who does not like ripping apart divers as the Great White itself, or blowing a shark from the inside out with a bang stick.

I kept jumping into a game back to back without stopping. Do you love games where you can jump in and out with matches lasting from 10min-15min? Have you always wanted to fight intelligent sharks with harpoon rifles, spear pistols, and underwater smgs? This game's got it.\n\nAs divers in the Blood & Gold game you are tasked with escorting steve to three safeboxes and guarding him while he opens them. You can collect loose treasure littering the hallways of cargo ships and the ocean floor, the more you collect, the more you earn. The more you earn, the more upgrades you can purchase for your weapons which can make quick work of the shark (tracking upgrades are so helpful).\n\nSharks in this game mode must either destroy s.t.e.v.e. or exhaust all of the divers of their respawn tickets. The more kills a shark racks up the more "evolution" traits they can earn. Such as increased stamina, heals from kills, and better sonar.\n\nIt's fun to play these matches as they set up and conclude very quickly. However the hitboxes for divers is huge. I remember multiple times clearly dodging sharks and dashing into an opening only to be rubberbanded into a sharks mouth. Another issue is the respawn points. Sometimes the game will throw you infront of a shark with no time to get your bearings. I believe this is because the game will spawn you next to S.T.E.V.E.\n\n\nTry the game out, it's no left 4 dead (really why do people think of it like this? Because it has four divers? Whenever people see a game with 4 players on a team they instantly squeak "Left 4 dead style". This is different, this is scuba style.\n\n\n\nOh, also if you press V or B you are able to say quick commands like "Get harPWND" or "Get Snorkled!" and other corny one liners.","July 12, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Mechanics are good too, I was worried about that because not a lot of games do a good job with underwater (furthermore animals and beasts), but its smooth and doesn't take long to get used to.","January 18","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like, by alot, I mean alot.\n\nLet's start by reviewing 3 things.\n\n1. The Gameplay\nThe gameplay is mostly divers and sharks swimming around trying to either get treasure under the sea and getting mauled in the process. Very fun to play with friends + you can upgrade your weapons.\nThere are 3 basic modes in the game.\nMegalodon Hunt\nBlood and Gold\nand one other game-mode I forget\n\nThe two modes are both equally entertaining as well as the other one I'm assuming. Also the feeling of getting hunted by sharks is both terrifying and exciting.\n\n2. The Visuals\nThe graphics in this game are very pretty, and beautiful. Shiny sheens and different water colors + good rust on ships and things under the sea are very nice and come together to make a very good atmosphere. Everything in this game is beautiful.","July 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As the divers, things become tense when you start hearing the heartbeats that indicate that a shark is nearby.  You have to juggle your base instinct to survive with the greed to collect the golden treasures littered along the watery depths.\n\nAnd the sharks are just as exciting.  By the nature of how the game is played, you'll always be outnumbered, but each shark has its own distinct trait that makes them dangerous, whether that means they're quick and stealthy, having the ability to turn the walls into death traps, or just overall being beefy and taking whatever hits the divers throw at them.\n\nGame tend to be fairly quick-paced.  With friends, it's extremely entertaining.  I have to admit that there are certain sharks that, once divers reach a certain point with their weapons, become ineffective at stopping the treasure hunters.   But overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with this purchase and look forward diving into it (hohoho) for some time.","April 21, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have the option of CHOOSING to play a SHARK without fear of being AUTO BALANCED on your team. Not up for being a shark? Same thing. You have the options of choosing a specific class to play or random, no matter your mood. This I enjoy greatly. It's nice to play a pvp with options and lack of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto-balance JUST WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO A CLASS YOU ENJOY. and I'm pretty sure anyone who has played some other animals vs people pvp game can empathize. >_>\n\nNow, onto the points.\n\nFantastic soundtrack, good quality with eerie undertones that make you on edge. Sounds are so important to this game, for shark and diver alike. What's around the corner? Friend or foe? Murky water and can't hear something coming up? Better listen for it, because that's your only hint.\n\nThe game controls are fairly simple, easy to learn but difficult to master depending on your reaction time. Once you get good at this game though, you get /good/. There are a ton of fantastic players out there too!\n\nModels are top notch and the animations blew me out of the water(Pun intended). The shark's scarred detail wiggle my inner 3D modeler, there's so much detail, even down to the "floating" jaw in the skull. Fantastic. The enviornment is one I wish I could kick back and explore in single player or with a friend, simply because it's so beautiful and breath taking(just don't drown), it's something I've always hoped I would see; underwater shark exploration. However, this is a pvp game and that's just fanciful dreaming! How far out does the map exactly go? I have no clue. Too busy eating divers to pay attention.\n\nNow, onto the single downside...\n\nSometimes there are hackers, sometimes there are pissbabies, sometimes there's bad apples, but that's to be expected in ANY pvp game. Take it leisurely, taking in the scenery, sharpen your skills, or just beat some AI divers to a pulp if you need to. It's not the games fault for the community, and over-all they are amazing people. I'd like to see more shark variants in the future, but please don't make a great game ruined by DLC. You guys have something no other PVP game does yet, and you did it well.\n\n10/10 - Say farewell and adieu to your fair spanish ladies.","May 17, 2015","true","87.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you can get a game where the other sharkknows what he is doing then it is the easiest game to beat, however if the divers have an ace then they can be the ones who give you a stuggle. I also think that this game is meant to be one you play with friends to get those reactions of, them being the last one while steve is trudging along, then BAM shark comes along and kills them. One thing i would like to see changed is the point and progression system. I have noticed that as he shark you do not get nearly enough points in agood game as the divers do. Also the progression system seems to slow down to a crawl at around level four or five. All in all though this game is great and i hope even more people get it (So it doesnt take me five minutes to get into a match).","November 29, 2014","true","46.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

DOESN'T MATTER! Depth is delightfully challenging and yet perfectly ballanced game!\nFew games can hit that mark so perfectly. I picked Depth up on a whim and I'm glad I did!\n\n\nPROs\n\n1) Easy to pick up.\nThis game is simple enough to understand within your first time playing, and deep enough to give the player room to grow. Both SHARK and DIVER teams have a unique play style. Sharks being aggresive and fast paced and Divers being focused on defence and survival. The controles are easy to understand for new players looking to play on either team.\n\n2) Competitive and Casual play\nPlay against players OR 4 different difficulty Levels of bots. Hard, Medium, Easy, or even Passive (If you just want to explore the maps) Players are always a mixed bag of difficulty, without being broken or over-powered. The Game's AI goes from being a walk in the park, up to an absolute challenging blood bath.\n\n3) Play with friends\nFun to play with, or against friends. Very few game crashes/Lag outs within me and my friend's experiance.\n\n4) Loadouts\nDivers can buy a veriety of weapons and tools at the match progresses. Making shopping a bit fun. Your loadout can be Min/Maxed or Set up for multi-role without feeling weak. Sharks have "Evolutions" as opposed to gear, which improves the sharks preformance in and out of combat. Making them move faster and all around become more deadly.\n\n5) Fun\nEnjoyable! Plane and simple. If you like L4D especially you will love this game.\n\n\n\nCONs\n\n1) The AI\nThis is one of thise games where the AI doesn't get smarter with Level, but rather cheaper. Player Sharks for example, might miss every once in a while when they lunge at a diver. AI Sharks at medium and higher levels always make a perfect B line to the players within reach. Perfectly weaving around the enviorment to get to them. Its not bad enough to be unfair... but you will find yourself cursing at the AI every now and again. In addition, AI Sharks may use the same predictable paths over and over at some sections of the maps. Making it almost too easy to fight them at these points. AI Divers are either too smart or too dumb. Sometimes swimming off all alone resulting in them getting ripped apart by sharks. Other times the diver AI will lock on to the sharks with pin point accuracy and almost never miss a shot.\n\n2) Lack of content.\n5 maps and 1 game mode. You will have fun with what little there is... but there still isn't much. Maybe in future patches or DLC there will be more.\n\n3) Friend heavy game.\nThere is nothing wrong with playing alone, but this game was obviously ment for friends. If you dont have friends who also play depth you may not have as much fun. I feel like playing alone takes away from over all the experiance.\n\n\n\n\nIn the end I would strongly recommend this game.

Provided you play with 5 other friends, it can be a blast and often a way to test your relationships. As usual, TL;DR is at the bottom, go on! You know you want too....\n\nWhat is Depth?\n\nDepth is an assymetrical team deathmatch consisting of 2 players as sharks, who play in the 3rd-person perspective, while there are 4 divers playing in first person. Divers have to follow an automated robot, S.T.E.V.E, in the hunt for undersea gold. While sharks have to stop them, at any cost!\n\nVariety:\n\nDivers have mutiple weapons at their disposable ranging from dual weild pistols to a net gun! Divers also have a variety of "consumables" consisting of mainly flares to help navigate the murky DEPTH! haha, I'll stop now, and mines.\n\nSharks' variety come in the form of different species of shark, including a megaladon. Yes. A freaking megaladon, granted in Megaladon Hunt it's 5 divers versus 1 freaking megaladon.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay is tense and varies in speed, games can be fast paced if well cooridinated or sharks can build tension by stalking in the shadows, wither way gameplay is smooth and fun! Depth works with a levelling system, at the end of a match you gain experience which can be used to unlock new abilities for sharks (such as increasing stamina). This is useful considering sharks have two skill traits which differentiate them: stamina and health. The ability to upgrade this helps tighten the gap between the fast, low health mako and the low stamina big health Great White. And, if you are that type of person, Depth offers leaderboards so you can compete in ranking with friends, too!\n\nPerformance:\n\nI ran this on a medium/high end PC ( i7 4790, 16GB RAM, GTX 760) with all settings turned all the way up it never dropped below 60 once, the pinnacle of PC mastery.\n\nWorth the buy?\n\nIt is indeed! The catch is that it's most fun with your buddies, but i never failed to have fun on a public server or even against AI in offline mode. At the time of writing (07/01/2015) Depth is $14.99 - worth picking up the four pack.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nDepth pits humans vs sharks, what other game gives you that?  And you follow S.T.E.V.E, it's like being controlled by an underwater WALL-E. 8/10 must consider for FPS fans.","January 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have the people who play games to have fun, and those who play to just be jerks. It's a lesson on how life can throw you curve balls. And once a curve ball is thrown, the rest of the balls thrown are curve balls. ceaseless and never ending curve balls.\n\nI mostly wrote this review to actually warn people that, in all honesty; be prepared to constantly die and rage quit. Those who have positioned themselved on the pinnacle of this leaderboard haven't given the game up. they continue to play and continue to make the game irritating and so much of a challenge, that, the challenge is to find another game that doesn't enduce rage.\n\nSo, yes, I recommend this game to those who are suicidal. This is as close to hell as one may get.\n\n10/10 will never play again.","June 6, 2015","true","94.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

If you can get a game where the other sharkknows what he is doing then it is the easiest game to beat, however if the divers have an ace then they can be the ones who give you a stuggle. I also think that this game is meant to be one you play with friends to get those reactions of, them being the last one while steve is trudging along, then BAM shark comes along and kills them. One thing i would like to see changed is the point and progression system. I have noticed that as he shark you do not get nearly enough points in agood game as the divers do. Also the progression system seems to slow down to a crawl at around level four or five. All in all though this game is great and i hope even more people get it (So it doesnt take me five minutes to get into a match).","November 29, 2014","true","46.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Megalodon should be 3x the size it is in game, and the weapon system should be harder to unlock like so many kills + so much gold = a certain weapon/ammo upgrade etc. The shark side seems to get the raw deal, but overall if you like a simple game an like being a shark its a good start.","December 10, 2015","true","15.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I love the theme of scuba divers looking for treasure while fighting off territorial sharks, despite it not being very realistic. The atmosphere is great too. Even though the game or the sharks aren't scary per say, there is just something about being in the ocean that's very unsettling. I haven't gone scuba diving in real life so I can't say how accurate the under water effects really are, but they all seem good and immersive to me. I really like how there are lots of schools of fish or an eel or octopus here and there. One thing I'm sure of that wouldn't be the case in real life is that I can hear a shark swimming towards me when I can't even see it yet, which makes it very easy to sound♥♥♥♥♥ them and quite unfair if you have a good weapon. If you know where one is coming from, you can just unload on it and the dash to the side when it is about to strike at you. I also just love the freedom of movement by being underwater.\n\nThe game pacing is interesting, too. It can be so calm and slow when the sharks are swimming outside the room you're in because they're scanning the environment or waiting for some diver equipment to be gone while you know they're very close because your heartbeat gets louder the closer they are, and then when they strike it's like all hell breaks loose and you're twitch-aiming because the sharks are fast and your diver can be fast too when dashing, or you get grabbed by one and you're mashing your left mouse button to stab it and try to get it killed before you're dead yourself. It can get very intense in a way that I haven't experienced in any other multiplayer shooter aside from the arena FPS games from the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nAs the divers collect money, they can use it to buy new weapons ranging from pistols to assault rifles to harpoon guns, or upgrades for weapons they already have, resulting in these weapons becoming dual wield or having tracking or poison on the shots, as well as all sorts of equipment such as sonar bouys to detect sharks, mines and turrets as extra defense and offense, or supply and healing kits so you and your teammates don't have to swim out in the open to get ammo or a first aid kit. Sharks have a different type of currency, for they get evolution points by getting kills to be able to purchase evolutions making them a lot more durable or faster, being able to detect mines, seeing what weapons the divers are holding or regenerating health after getting a kill. This is a bit more unfair than the gold where all divers get the gold that one diver collects, because if you have a really good shark teammate getting all the kills, you won't be able to upgrade your shark at all. You'll most likely still win because of the good teammate, but it's a lot more fun to become an alpha predator yourself.\n\nIt does have some balancing issues. It seems that severe lag for the sharks often works out in their favour and I've noticed a lot of active people quitting because the game is becoming more and more casual with each weapon and equipment that gets added, but I just can't help having a blast when playing this. There also isn't any penalty to losing because you get experience points based on your own performance, not winning or losing, and there is only a stat that says how many games you played, not a win/lose ratio. It might not be suitable for a highly competitive environment with these arguable balancing issues, but I also haven't found a better game to scratch my itch for underwater shark-wrecking and diver devouring carnage. Whenever a new gamemode, playable shark or diver weapons and gear get added, which have all been free up to this point, I return to this game and enjoy it every single time.","December 28, 2015","true","106.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Anyone who's known me for years will tell you this.  It's one of my "things", truth be told.  So imagine my excitement to see this game being announced, and my even greater excitement to see it finally come down to fifteen dollaroonies in a sale.  So what do I think of Depth, from the relatively little I've played so far?  Well...I gotta say...I'm actually kinda disappointed...\n\nIt's undeniably one of the most original and inspired premises for a "deathmatch" type of game, EVER.  Period.  Great whites versus treasure-hunting divers!  How cool is that?  And it IS a cool enough game, and certainly cleverly enough envisioned...it's kind of hard really to imagine how they could've executed such a premise much better, but...somehow, it's lacking something.  Er...DEPTH, I think the word may be, ironically enough!\n\nSimply put, there's not much to it.  Play the shark for fifteen minutes, then play a diver for fifteen minutes...and you've seen just about all the game has to offer, really.  Sure there's weapon upgrades and shark upgrades and what-not, but the scenery is very samey (it's all underwater, I suppose) and the action is...repetitive, to say the least.  So despite it being a fantastic idea for a game on PAPER, I'm not sure this ever had the potential to be all that much, at least from the moment that they decided to make it a multi-player deathmatch-a-thon.  It's fun - if only for a while - and it IS refreshingly straightforward to just leap straight into, as either human OR shark (certainly for anyone who's played a dozen or two first-person shooters in their time; unlike so many other competitive multi-player games, where you feel like you need a PHD in said game before you can play online without get "kicked" almost instantaneously)!  But there's still something just disappointingly...SHALLOW about it all...  (Oh, there I go again, with my silly underwater puns!)\n\nLook, honestly, I'm really not that much of a "deathmatch" fan to begin with.  Left 4 Dead 2 is the ONLY versus game I've ever found truly compelling, and a part of me suspects I won't find another multi-player game THAT addictive until Left 4 Dead 3 comes out (I'm banking on a release sometime before 2020, but then again, I always have been a naïve soul).  This game is...FINE.  BETTER than fine, even.  I'd even go so far as to say it's pretty darn GOOD, and certainly a more-than-serviceable super-casual, jump-in/jump-out kinda game/distraction.  But I guess I'm just gonna have to wait until someone decides to make a single-player "survival horror" game based around great whites before I truly WET MY PANTS in excitement...  (Whoo boy, they just keep on a-comin'!)\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","December 25, 2014","true","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This one has pretty decent and atmospheric maps and overall visuals too so I would compare it to UT3 underwater with gore, sharks, and treasure hunt. The overall feeling I get is the same frantic brainless simple multiplayer action mechanics that made me love the UT since 3 to 4 so much. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to play this and sometimes that's great when all you do is want a little of braindead fun which you can get in and leave when done just like that.

This game has given me more bang for the buck than most AAA 60 dollar titles I have purchased. I think I found this game in my que. While the video on the store page is good, what sold me on the game is a collection of videos by a you tuber named Ohmwrecker. These videos gave me a very clear picture of what the game play was like as a diver and a shark, and he and his friends sounded like they were having a blast. This game usually sells for around 25 dollars, and while I can't recommend it to everyone for that price,  Digital Confectioners have put this game on sale twice since I've purchased it for under 10 dollars. I think anyone who is even remotely interested in what they see in game play videos owe it to themselves to pick this game up. This game does have an intimidating learning curve. As a diver if you are well versed at shooters you will be up to speed in no time. If you aren't, don't sweat it, that is what machine guns are for. I am not the best player, so I steer clear of the spear guns. Also there are ways to play to support your team even if you aren't netting high damage per game. I don't know what to compare playing a shark too, but I love it. There are many very informative guides on steam written by players who have the taken the time to lay the basics and more out to help ease you into the game, I can't recommend enough you read them. I personally figured out diving myself, but was very intimidated by playing as a shark, and used a guide until I got my feet under me. There are always people playing so you don't have to worry about dead servers. The small size of the community is a blessing and a curse. Players are mostly friendly and helpful, and you will run into the same players often. At the same time you will often get matched up with players who far out level you. All said and done I love this game and if it wasn't for bloodborne this would be my game of the year 2015!","March 3","true","332.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have wanted it for quite a while, I love the PvP concept with different species.  I was blown away with how good it is.  My time with it has been very well spent.  This game is INTENSE!  This is what I wanted from Evolve, which was disappointing.  Does Depth still have some rough edges? Yes.  Does it matter when you're playing? NOT ONE BIT!  :D\n\nPlaying as a diver is stressful, in a good way.  They've done a great job on the atmosphere and feeling of it.  Hearing your heartbeat speed up is a great indicator of the increased danger, I love it.  It's never a completely one-sided battle, sharks are fast, divers have tech.  Currently no difference in each diver that I can see, it's all about your load-out.\n\nThe sharks all have different strength and weaknesses.  Playing as a shark is fantastic, really gives you that "hunting" feel.  Find a shark you're good at and stick with it, there are a lot of differences.  I'm best with the Great White, one friend I play with goes Mako.\n\nI honestly enjoy both modes equally, they give such different experiences, it's almost hard to believe it's the same game.\n\nDevelopers seem to be putting good work into the game, updates are well-stocked with features and fixes.\n\n9/10 for the improvements that I know will be coming to make it a 10/10 for me.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8qcIDEXegk&list=PL6jaU7aRMeiBqUtUa1JUPXj2JeERAMN9i&index=8","June 13, 2015","true","69.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Instead of weaponry and competition, I really think the focus should be in horror.\n\nThe game's pace is very fast. So fast, in fact, that you can't get immersed in the time you are already dead. (Think of fast CS rounds.) And respawning mere seconds after dying to the same position takes away your will to stay alive, so that too breaks immersion. If the gameplay was slower (and actually the diver swimming speed is itself too fast) there would be a chance to take notice of your environment, look around and build tension.\n\nI think the game reveals too much; letting you know all the time where your squad mates are with glowing outlines. It would be a lot creepier if you were forced to communicate with them to understand your relative position, and I believe this would hugely benefit the game. There is sadly very little room for sneaking due to the fast pace, and strategizing seems to be out of question due to always being in a hurry to die in a few seconds.\n\nMenus and HUDs are alright with no extra fancy things – I respect that. But I have to say that some game features are less intuitive. For example, the heart beat effect is striking, but I did not understand what causes it: is there a hidden fatigue meter? Hidden stress meter? Does it imply a close shark? I simply could not tell. And also some numbers jumping up in the screen with successful hits were confusing as there were so many that one could not tell what the numbers meant. One of them surely was the immediately damage I dealt, but the others? These need some clarification.\n\nRight now it's a game of swimming immediately to a fixed location, killing the enemy, dying, buying a bigger gun, respawning again, then repeating this again. Heck, it might even make sense to die on purpose to get to buy things. All this takes the huge potential scare the game could have away. I'm hoping there will at least be more hardcore or scary experience -focused game modes if the main idea remains unchanged.\n\nWould love to play this as a diver with a dying flashlight with Oculus. :)","July 9, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There was one fun bug I encountered where my diver swam into a small crack in the geometry and got stuck, paving myself in the walls Amontillado style. That bug was fixed the very next day. Here's hoping they continue with the good fixes and keep their promise for new maps and SDK.\n\nMy only problem is that you will gain an average of 150xp per match, and every level requires (to my knowledge) Level * 100 xp to progress to the next. You will need to reach level 23 to unlock every item, which is about 27,600 xp. Expect to run about 180 matches (if your having a gg, not a bg) before you can test everything. Some of these equips and abilities are amazing, which is why it's a little sad that you are at a slight disadvantage if you cannot use them, against someone who can select their own specialized unlocks, in a competitive game.\n\nEdit: It appears that after level 10, the XP is capped at 1,000xp. So I guess there is a proverbial  diminishing returns light at the end of the shark cave.","November 13, 2014","true","11.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/recommended/274940/","Paddles93","[TPZ] Cereal Killer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/","219 products in account","About The Game:\nDepth is created by Digital Confectioners an indie developer who felt it was a good idea to really spice things up with a game of Team Deathmatch against Sharks & Divers.\n\nThis game shares the great aspect of fast paced Survival Action & at the same time horror as you never know when a shark is going to rip you apart.\n\nGameplay:\nDepth is a game based on fast paced decision making & shooting, this game punishes you for not thinking quickly and acting even faster.\n\nThis game focuses on a Team Deathmatch experience as well as objectives in small for the Divers to win you can either kill all the Sharks or you can watch out for your diving machine while it collects all the tresure and guide it back to your boat safely. As a Shark you have to simply stop the Divers from collecting all the tresure or by killing them all.\n\nThe game consists of 2 teams, 4 Divers VS. 2 Sharks. Each team relys on the other players to work together otherwise you'll waste more lives than you should if you're not working together and soon be out.\n\nEach time has 30 lives in the beginning and you have to monitor your teams deaths as closely as possible as those lives run out fast.\n\nGameplay as the Diver is as expected, pretty slow & very vulnerable, you can be detected by a shark really easily and there's no way to heal yourself after you are attacked so this puts you in a tough spot if you're in a hurry or running low on lives.\n\nDivers can use weapons such as Pistols, Assault Rifles, Netguns, Harpoons, Tagging Pistols & Rifles, etc there's a very large range of weapons at your disposal but each weapon needs to be unlocked by completeing missions and ranking up. Divers also have a range of placeable items such as Sea Mines & Motion Sensor Boeys in order to track or kill a Shark, you also have Flares which you can use to see into dark parts of the ocean bed if you wish.\n\nSharks rely on their instincts & teamwork in order to beat the Divers, you need to work with your partner to maximize you brutality and cunning, this can set the team in a panic and give you a chance to sneak off with one of the Divers in your jaws.\n\nSharks come with a wide variety of Abilities & Upgrades as the Divers do, you gain the ability to withstand more damage, regenerate health, feast on Divers blood to increase health &  stamina, gain a Hammer Head to smash through walls and roofs at an increased rate, resist tagging devices, spot Sea Mines and smell out Divers from a greater distance.\n\nSharks are really terrifying up close but at a distance they're in a danger zone, because the Diver weapons are fairly strong and do deal a lot of damage so don't think you can just rush in at the Divers without dying.\n\nSingle Player:\nDepth has a Single Player mode that pits you against Bots to test your skills & learn how to play the game in a controlled and relaxed environment unless you switch the difficulty up that is. In Single Player you cannot unlock new weapons.\n\nMultiplayer:\nDepth also has a Multiplayer PvP where you and 5 other people can play together as Divers & Sharks it works as explained in the gameplay section above ^. In Multiplayer you can unlock equipment and upgrades as normal.\n\nCo-operative:\nDepth also has a CO-OP mode where you and 4 friends can play as Divers together and take on the bot Sharks or you and 2 Friends can play as Sharks and take on the 4 Bot Divers,  In CO-OP you can unlock upgrades & equipment as normal.\n\nVerdict:\nDepth is a very interesting idea for a game, it combines the fast paced gameplay of "Call of Duty" into a much better game of cat and mouse while at the same time keeping things very well balanced out and never feeling underpowered against the enemies.\n\nDepth has such solid gameplay and teamplay that makes it succeed at what it wanted to, it leaves you feeling like a badass when you complete the game as a Diver against the Sharks because of your solid teamwork and coordination with your team and it makes you feel like a killing machine when you defeat the Divers as Sharks.\n\nEven if you don't win you still feel accomplished at the end of the game because it's such a fantastic game.\n\nThere is however are a few things this game needs to fix:\n\nNetwork lag when you play as the Divers really puts you at a disadvantaged when you are getting attacked from out of nowhere or when the Shark just magically teleports infront of you. Even in my home region i was getting lag.\n\nThe Spawning System in Depth needs some work, i found myself spawning and dying a lot because of being spawned right infront of a Shark.\n\nRating:\nAnd finally after coming down to it this game receives from my a solid 8/10, it's not perfect but it's certainly worth a the money you pay for it.\n\nIt brings something new to the table & does it well props to the developers for thinking outside the box, it feels a lot like Zombie Panic! Source.\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nYes i do, pick this up whenever you've got a chance you won't regret it.","November 9, 2014","true","8.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Going into detail about what it is, Depth is a multiplayer game in which a team of 4 divers is pitted against 2 sharks. Lacking in an abundance of game modes in which I hope the devs will be adding more on later, Depth features a great selection of maps which are well-designed and look fantastic from the surface as well as in the ocean you're playing in. Atmosphere in this game is extremely heavy as while you're searching for treasure you hear your heartbeat get faster and faster until one of those two sharks approaches from the dark depths (lmao geddit xdddd) and rips your diver in two. Optimization in this game is also done fantastically as I've only experienced this game crashing on me only two times, other than that your frames in this game should be fine even if you meet the minimum recommended specs for this game. Overall I'd say buy this game either for full price or on sale, either way it's up to you just make sure you get a chance to experience this fantastic game!\n\nEDIT: Had experienced crashes, contacted support and told them what problems I was having, they had responded and patched the crash approximately a week later, kudos to these guys for giving a damn about their game unlike some other devs. Hoping to support these guys in whatever they decide to do next!","December 28, 2015","true","15.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Team-Based, Mulitplayer Action Gore-Fest known as Depth. Depth recently celebrated it's 1st birthday on Steam and has been around since November 3rd, 2014. It was released by Developer/Publisher Digital Confectioners.\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/e9BIjKTJPWE\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nGreat twist on the Team-Based Multiplayer experience. You can be a diver or a shark. What more can you ask for?\n4.5/5, Grab the 4-pack (especially when it's on sale)!\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nMany of my friends know I am not a big fan of this style of game. I did play BF3 for a while and enjoyed it, and I did the CoD streams with Echo, but Team-Based Multiplayer games like this were never much more than average fare (for me). This beast, though. Man. This is what Evlove SHOULD have been. One team is the Divers, the other team is the Sharks. There are mutliple game modes, I spent most of my time in the Blood & Gold mode (divers collect treasure and defend themselves, sharks eat divers). You can earn money/evolution points and upgrade your weapons and items or abilities as a shark. Really, talking about a game like this is frankly a waste of time. It's something you have to play to enjoy. I typically am non-plussed by this style of game, but this one really is TONS of fun and took me back to the golden days of MultiPlayer gaming with my friends on Goldeneye and the like. This is cheaper, and better, than Evolve. The $24.99 or so that you can buy a 4-pack for during a Steam sale is an absolute steal. The graphics are great, the sounds add to the fun, the controls are simple. Add in neat skins and stuff (cosmetics), and it's a nice little game that seems to be picking up in community numbers. Give it a go and get in now while the community is growing. The Devs are active and the game still gets regular updates. This is the kind of game you cumulatively sink hundreds of hours to over time.\n\n4.5/5 as it's still growing into that 5 that I am positive it will get to.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","December 5, 2015","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is very balanced, even though when you first play you'll probably think otherwise. It has a fairly high learning curve for the divers, sharks being much easier to pick up but not any more powerful than the divers.\n\nIf you want to succeed as a diver, make dang sure you have your settings set where your computer runs with at least 30-40fps.

The simple explonation for this game is Dino D-Day with a better story, graphics, balanced game play, and the nearly impossiblly found feeling from the game of being left out and useless. This game is so greatly balanced that theres nothing wrong with the game play, yeah sure you might have the feeling like "I know every little thing about this character/shark/thing" but after playing a few rounds you start to learn the abilities and then you slowly gain new ablilties, just making the sharks or divers a little more on edge. Now I wouldnt give this a 10/10 simply because if you have more practice than someone who is new, then your chance at winning just increases and thats not really fair, but I would recommend that people who are a little more use to the game gets parred up with people who are experenced and the unexperenced with the unexperenced so it has a more stable and well rounded gameplay. Now this game also holds a lot of realistic aspects, not only for the sharks and the strenght and speed of them but also the divers hearing a muffeled bashing sound when the shark breaks things. Although they did add one Jaws classic heart pounding feature, which is exactly that, intensifying the feeling of the diver's impending doom thats right around the corner - Sharks. Also their DLCs are (going to be and are) free, thats a good feeling to buy a game not be bound by your wallet on your gameplay experence. Now seeing how Ive only seen one downside to the game its going to be extreamly high of a ranking, but there was still one problem, I would give it a 19/20 because of the realistic feeling, the graphics quaility, and the over all gameplay, it is not a 20 because of the one downside, and this isnt out of 10 because it was just too close to have only 10 points at maximum score, but this game is one of the best games I think that steam has right now. If this game goes on sail (pun) I recommend giving it a go.","January 12, 2015","true","75.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have logged some hours into it on my free time and have enjoyed every scare, loss, and win.

This multiplayer only, asymetrical shooter is the type of game that breathes life into the stale genre of FPS, where little innovation occurs due to the small number of big name franchises that dominate the market.\n\nPros:\n- High intensity\n- Smart gameplay\n- Balanced\n- Tactics required for success\n- Great fun to be had for both teams, but in different ways\n- Feels fresh\n\nCons:\n- Small number of maps\n- Bot games switch from too easy to too hard between easy and medium\n- Price is a little high\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game, but would also recommend trying to get it cheaper than it's current price through deals/sales.","November 15, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The simple explonation for this game is Dino D-Day with a better story, graphics, balanced game play, and the nearly impossiblly found feeling from the game of being left out and useless. This game is so greatly balanced that theres nothing wrong with the game play, yeah sure you might have the feeling like "I know every little thing about this character/shark/thing" but after playing a few rounds you start to learn the abilities and then you slowly gain new ablilties, just making the sharks or divers a little more on edge. Now I wouldnt give this a 10/10 simply because if you have more practice than someone who is new, then your chance at winning just increases and thats not really fair, but I would recommend that people who are a little more use to the game gets parred up with people who are experenced and the unexperenced with the unexperenced so it has a more stable and well rounded gameplay. Now this game also holds a lot of realistic aspects, not only for the sharks and the strenght and speed of them but also the divers hearing a muffeled bashing sound when the shark breaks things. Although they did add one Jaws classic heart pounding feature, which is exactly that, intensifying the feeling of the diver's impending doom thats right around the corner - Sharks. Also their DLCs are (going to be and are) free, thats a good feeling to buy a game not be bound by your wallet on your gameplay experence. Now seeing how Ive only seen one downside to the game its going to be extreamly high of a ranking, but there was still one problem, I would give it a 19/20 because of the realistic feeling, the graphics quaility, and the over all gameplay, it is not a 20 because of the one downside, and this isnt out of 10 because it was just too close to have only 10 points at maximum score, but this game is one of the best games I think that steam has right now. If this game goes on sail (pun) I recommend giving it a go.","January 12, 2015","true","75.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fun in this game comes from the tactics really, as a shark you really have to be careful, you die just as fast as the diver...but you ar MUCH faster ;) Wait for a diver to swim past a doorway then lunge through, turning the corner so that their friends can't shoot you, and chew them up :D\n\nAs a diver, you simply *have* to use the equipment to be effective. You won't see a good shark coming until it's almost on top of you, but with sonar and tagging systems, you can help relieve this drawback! :D\n\nThe second mode is Megladon Hunt, a team of divers against one Megladon, and the divers have to collect treasure to upgrade their guns!\n\nPros -\n~ Very Spooky game, more atmospheric than you'd imagine\n~ Hilarious fun\n~ Good replayability\n~ Rewarding for skilled players\n~ Quite easy to find a match\n~ UPGRADE SYSTEMS YAY\n~ Pretty and interesting world\n\nCons -\n~ Menus are kinda dated\n~ Character models are a bit lax, but I assume that might get an update\n~ Only 3 choices of shark, bit generic too. Was hoping for some cool things like having built in abilities for the sharks, for example a hammer head could ram better maybe?\n~ No customization of character sadly (WE WANT HATS, WE WANT HATS, WE WANT HATS)\nSeriously, every game needs microtransactions for cosmetics :D\n\nAll in all, while it's on sale I'd definitely pick it up, I think £18-19 is a bit too much but having paid £11, I'm damn happy with my purchase :D\n8/10 "Best diving game ever" - Davy Jones","January 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You get to play as either a shark or a diver. The objective of the divers is to work as a team of four to collect treasure from different settings on the sea floor with a robot safe picker called S.T.E.V.E. Divers move from one objective to the next on the map and have to escort S.T.E.V.E to each treasure safe until the team makes it back to the extraction point at which point the divers win. Divers are armed with different undersea weapons like harpoons, net guns, and undersea mines. The sharks come in teams of two and their goal is obviously to eat the divers before the sharks run out of lives or the diver team makes it back to the extraction point. The game requires some strategy without being too complicated; divers tend to stick together to back each other up and the sharks do best when coming up with surprise entrances to swoop in and grab a diver for dinner.

The game does great job at submerging players into its wonderful underwater environment. Everything works, from, the ambient objects and creatures that make up your surroundings, the lighting decaying as you descend deeper into the threatening ocean and the heartbeat sounds as the shark draws closer and close.\n\nMy first impressions upon playing depth was that of a young kids learning to swim in the deep ocean,\nI didn’t have any idea and was ♥♥♥♥ scared. After I realized It was ok to leave the cage, I started to swim around and collect the shiny treasure scattered on the sea floor, then I heard a heartbeat sound that was rapidly increasing I knew that the shark was getting closer, boom, all of a sudden I have this great white shark eating half my body, leaving me with wet patch of ♥♥♥♥ on my pants.\n\nThe gameplay was pretty smooth, a little lag from my system that made it hard to focus my gun on the shark before it eviscerated me.

This game is a mixture of intensity and quick shooting. Hearing the heartbeat (signal for divers that a shark is nearby) and frantically trying to find where the shark is before it gets you is one of the most engaging aspects of this game.\n\nThe game is surprisingly fair and balanced. Even though it's 4v2 (and in the new mode 5v1), the sharks don't feel underbalanced, nor are they OP. They're balanced basically as Glass Cannons, encouraging a hit and run style of gameplay. Being on the Diver team requires teamwork, since divers are easier to kill, and have a shorter vision range. Even though communication with teammates is next-to impossible, keeping an eye out for your teammates as a diver is encouraged, as to avoid losing too many respawns early on.\n\nWould I say $25 is worth it? Maybe. I bought it 50% off, and I would encourage anyone to get it on sale, but the game is being updated and kept stable by the developers. While the gameplay could arguably become mundane over time, if the game is kept updated and fresh with new maps, sharks, and weapons, this could be a classic in the making.\n\nAt the very least, it's a damn good aesthetic.","April 3, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Today(+1 day after sale day) I am the MVP in about 80-90% of the games I play. So either the other people are even newer than me, or it just isn't hard to pick up.\n\nNB! It isn't unbalanced. Unless the divers go out exploring the map(which happens) or the sharks don't use the environment(destroy the walls!), it is very balanced. It is very often a close call.\n\nPros:\n* Very beautiful and "fluid" gameplay\n* Huge open maps - although I don't suggest you to go explore them as a diver\n* Fun weapons - you are happy for every connecting shot\n* Fun gadgets(mines[FUN!], nets, etc)\n* You truly feel anxious in open waters\n* Fun "combat system" - you get to stab the shark in the face if he grabs you\n* Those cat and mouse dashes where the shark tries to catch you but you dart out of the way(makes your heart race)\n* You get to kill a lot of sharks - expect at least 5+ on your first game(30 sharks total for 4 divers)\n* Shortish matches - about 15-20 minutes I'd say. But they seem fast and I haven't had the time to look at the clock :D\n* Constant intense gameplay - there are no 'slow moments'\n\nCons (very subjective):\n* I think the menu system is clunky. For example I havent' found where I can see my unlocks outside of a match. I'd say it is very robust, but still lacking a bit.\n* The weapon upgrade system doesn't quite suit me. I don't know why, it's just bugging me. I'd prefer a tech-tree maybe.\n* It can get repetitive after about 5+  matches in sequence. A little down-time helps with that.\n* Could have more maps(currently 7, I'd like 15 at least). I know this is immense work, but still.\n* Could have more weapons/gadgets - not that there aren't any, but I'd just like more :)\n* Gold retriveal part - that needs to be made a bit more interesting\n* There doesn't seem to be a way to "turn around" the battle, the probable winner(team) usually starts to become clear after the first few larger attacks.\n\nOverall, very glad I bought this and I hope the community sticks. 9/10","April 3, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play either as a shark or diver and i have as much fun as either. Completely different tactics for each side.\nThe sharks are looking to make blistering attacks where they can whisk their prey away from their other, armed, divers.\nThe divers need to stick together, preferably within areas which are well protected by the scenery. However, in order to get their upgrades, divers need to collect gold and deposit it back with STEVE, an underwater robot controlled from the surface. Steve breaks into safes, and you have to protect him until he's done and back safely.\nSharks get upgrades too, and earn 1 upgrade point for each diver killed. So there's the incentive, if you needed one.\n\nBoth teams have a  limited amount of respawns, so both divers and sharks have to pick their attacks carefully else they'll run out.\n\nAnd that's it - not a complicated game, but a lot of fun.\n\nNegatives?\nEvery review needs to be balanced, but i will emphasise that the positives really outweigh the negatives for me.\n\nAfter 10 hours i do feel a slight nagging repetitiveness of the maps creeping in. I hate myself for saying this as on only medium settings i do find the maps very well done. Would like so see more please.\nOn the subject of graphics, i find my nvidea GTX 870M blasting away at full steam playing this whereas withother games i own, arguably more graphics intensive, seem much better optimised. That's a very high level view though but people with lower performance cards might be struggling.\nPerhaps the folks at http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/ can teach them a thing or two - probably the best optimised game i've ever played given the old crappy system i used to play Banished on. Check his blog re the work he did on this.\n\nI have not played since the update which was released today and which is supposed to help towards dealing with disconnectors/AFK's. My comments may be outdated already but people disconnecting ruined games. Maybe the bots will help with that.\n\nOther than that, all good imo!","November 11, 2014","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Okay, so if your still not convinced, wait a while for a resonable sale, and if you are stuck between buying this game or another, BUY THIS GAME. I have logged some hours into it on my free time and have enjoyed every scare, loss, and win.

As a diver, you have to collect treasure, defend your robot, and HIDE!!  The sharks will swoop you up almost instantly and it takes a headstrong group to avoid a chum fest.   Playing as the shark is unlike anything else in this genre.   Incredible speed and dirty tactics is all you need.  Each shark has different active abilities.  The great white can take extra damage while the tiger shark (My personal favorite) can become invisible for a short time.  As long as they keep the content rolling, I can find time for this gem.  I can't wait to see whats next.  The Megaladon game mode they just added is fun.  Its like tag, but the player who is it, is a GIGANTIC SHARK.  The maps are large and well made.

Customization is lacking, but the weaponry is very fun. It has it's share of "Run for your life!" fast paced parts, and slow "I'll cover you while ___" teamwork parts. But that's for the divers. On the Shark side you'll find your fast paced parts to be running after fleeing prey, while your slow paced parts are waiting for that moment to surprise your prey when they let their gaurd down. The maps are set up to have multiple of each of these moments per match. With flanking tunnels, hidden risky treasure, and break-able walls for the sharks you can never have the same thing happen twice. For the divers; your small size can help you find hidden places or escape routes, while the sharks can use their unearthly strength the break the enviroment to reach their destination: Lunch.\n\nHowever, the real killer of the game is not the Great White, but the game's lobby times. You'll spend probably just as long in-game trying to get into a game. You can often times find a group that just does game-after-game on their own, who you can just hitch a ride with for a few matches. But if you're on your own / not enough people are on that day - WHICH IS VERY COMMON - You'll be waiting for a few hours.\n\nIf you have friends to gift this to; that problem will be solved for you until you tire of swimming around in the dark depths. Not only will it be fixed for you, but you'll likely also be giving other people lobbies to join! If that 4-pack goes on sale please consider it for your friends to all jump into and enjoy. You won't be bored keeping this community alive.\n\nBut as far as the people staying alive in-game... Good luck.","April 3, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can buy new weapons to better defend yourself, and can also buy consumables, like Mines, Shark Shields, which restrict the sharks view upon entering the radius of it, Sonar Beacons & flares to help see better.\nAs a shark, you can play as a Tiger Shark, a Great White, or a Mako, all with various strengths & weaknesses.\nYour goal is to either eat all of the divers, or destroy S.T.E.V.E. You can buy upgrades to better attack the humans with points. You can increase your speed, how much health you gain over time, various abilities, etc.\nBut honestly. If you like FPS's, you'll like to play as the diver. If you like to be a deadly beast, or pretty much anything, you'll like the shark.\nBut honestly, this game is a must have.

The fun in this game comes from the tactics really, as a shark you really have to be careful, you die just as fast as the diver...but you ar MUCH faster ;) Wait for a diver to swim past a doorway then lunge through, turning the corner so that their friends can't shoot you, and chew them up :D\n\nAs a diver, you simply *have* to use the equipment to be effective. You won't see a good shark coming until it's almost on top of you, but with sonar and tagging systems, you can help relieve this drawback! :D\n\nThe second mode is Megladon Hunt, a team of divers against one Megladon, and the divers have to collect treasure to upgrade their guns!\n\nPros -\n~ Very Spooky game, more atmospheric than you'd imagine\n~ Hilarious fun\n~ Good replayability\n~ Rewarding for skilled players\n~ Quite easy to find a match\n~ UPGRADE SYSTEMS YAY\n~ Pretty and interesting world\n\nCons -\n~ Menus are kinda dated\n~ Character models are a bit lax, but I assume that might get an update\n~ Only 3 choices of shark, bit generic too. Was hoping for some cool things like having built in abilities for the sharks, for example a hammer head could ram better maybe?\n~ No customization of character sadly (WE WANT HATS, WE WANT HATS, WE WANT HATS)\nSeriously, every game needs microtransactions for cosmetics :D\n\nAll in all, while it's on sale I'd definitely pick it up, I think £18-19 is a bit too much but having paid £11, I'm damn happy with my purchase :D\n8/10 "Best diving game ever" - Davy Jones","January 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You get to play as either a shark or a diver. The objective of the divers is to work as a team of four to collect treasure from different settings on the sea floor with a robot safe picker called S.T.E.V.E. Divers move from one objective to the next on the map and have to escort S.T.E.V.E to each treasure safe until the team makes it back to the extraction point at which point the divers win. Divers are armed with different undersea weapons like harpoons, net guns, and undersea mines. The sharks come in teams of two and their goal is obviously to eat the divers before the sharks run out of lives or the diver team makes it back to the extraction point. The game requires some strategy without being too complicated; divers tend to stick together to back each other up and the sharks do best when coming up with surprise entrances to swoop in and grab a diver for dinner.

For those of you who are on the fence on buying this game, I would like to highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a unique experience.\n\nI would describe Depth as a refreshing first person shooter with a good mix of survival aspects and teamwork (which opens up the opportunity for an overall fun experience with friends). The overall premise of the game as you can already probably notice is that there are two modes, the first one being "Blood and Gold" where four players play as divers who are seeking treasure in the underwater DEPTHS alongside an AI driven robot called STEVE while two other players play on an opposing geam as sharks (either Mako, Great white, and Tiger) ad the second mode being Megalodon hunt which essentially takes four divers vs a "huge" (not really huge as this was more of a design choice for easire movement) megalodon.\n\nThe movement and combat sytle for each team is great, and the mechanics of the game is well balanced with both teams having a set amoutn of 30 respawns they can burn through and sharks having specific skill perks you can purchase through your kill points, and divers having the opportunity to buy and earn better weapons through picking up treasure individually and delivering it to STEVE for the cash bonus.\nFrom shaking your mouse as a shark to tear divers apart once you grab hold of them, to replenishing health via eating seals, to the game taking advantage of what can be called "Drawing distance" to add suspense and adrenaline rushes as divers try to peer out into the distance or shadows searching for the other team before they strike (sharks distance in relation to a diver's position is relayed to you the player through the speed of heartbeats) Depth has a lot of unique elements that I enjoy.\n\nCompalints are that I can see some people not enjoying the fact that this game boils down to one specific formula of asymetric play which might bore people, but so far with the 10 hours I've put into the game I'm still really enjoying it and consider the game a great price for what I got out of it (I bought it during its week long discount of $14.99 but would recommend it still even at $24.99). Another complaint is that for a game with the visuals that Depth has, it strangely can be somewhat taxing on a system, as I believe TotalBiscuit pointed out himself on his own rig in his WTF is...)\n\nWhat it boils down to, is that if you really enjoyed L4D2 multiplayer, or are greatly interested in Evolve for its unique gameplay, then you'll really enjoy Depth.","January 14, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Customization is lacking, but the weaponry is very fun. It has it's share of "Run for your life!" fast paced parts, and slow "I'll cover you while ___" teamwork parts. But that's for the divers. On the Shark side you'll find your fast paced parts to be running after fleeing prey, while your slow paced parts are waiting for that moment to surprise your prey when they let their gaurd down. The maps are set up to have multiple of each of these moments per match. With flanking tunnels, hidden risky treasure, and break-able walls for the sharks you can never have the same thing happen twice. For the divers; your small size can help you find hidden places or escape routes, while the sharks can use their unearthly strength the break the enviroment to reach their destination: Lunch.\n\nHowever, the real killer of the game is not the Great White, but the game's lobby times. You'll spend probably just as long in-game trying to get into a game. You can often times find a group that just does game-after-game on their own, who you can just hitch a ride with for a few matches. But if you're on your own / not enough people are on that day - WHICH IS VERY COMMON - You'll be waiting for a few hours.\n\nIf you have friends to gift this to; that problem will be solved for you until you tire of swimming around in the dark depths. Not only will it be fixed for you, but you'll likely also be giving other people lobbies to join! If that 4-pack goes on sale please consider it for your friends to all jump into and enjoy. You won't be bored keeping this community alive.\n\nBut as far as the people staying alive in-game...

I haven't been so afraid of sharks since I watched Deep Blue Sea (Jaws only had one shark, so yeah). The concept alone would probably earn it a 8/10, and anything after that is just icing on the cake.\n\nSo, let's start off with what I've been very impressed with. The visuals are absolutely stunning. While many of the decorative options will considerably slow your average computer down a good bit, they are absolutely worth it if you can handle it.\n\nWhen you are playing as a shark, you have some sense of awesomeness and that you are going to wreck everybody, even if you really aren't. If I can play a character and do bad and still feel like a boss, then there's either something wrong with me or the game is really fun. This does not, by any means, make the sharks OP. They aren't. I've killed a good number of sharks in every match, so if you can't kill them, maybe you should try another strategy.\n\nWhen playing as a diver, you have some sort of fear of imminent fright, much like when everything turns quiet in a horror movie. In all honesty, you feel rather helpless. However, this doesn't mean that you are defenseless.\n\nThere are a wide range of weaponry to fit many playstyles; there is a netgun, tagging pistols, a DPV to swim faster with, machine guns, and as if the machine guns weren't surprising enough, there's a harpoon gun that shoots explosive harpoons. FRAGGIN GRENADES STRAPPED TO A GOOD 'OL WHALE-O-MATIC 2000!\n\nWhile I was somewhat disappointed with the narrow range of sharks, I was impressed with the abilities and playstyles they complimented. You can go squishy and speedy, sneaky, or big and tanky. Fun for the whole family (not really, I don't reccomend showing this to young persons or old persons for risk of nightmares and/or heart attacks)!\n\nAfter a good bit of time playing this, I have very few quarrels with this game, and the ones I have are rather extraneous. However, they are there regardless.\n\nOne thing that I was disappointed with was the amount of resources it will take to run this smoothly. If you expect to run this game at smooth 30-60 FPS, then, well, let's just say you're going to need a bigger boat. I suppose I shouldn't be so much disappointed with the game as I should be with my computer's gaming capabilities, but I am disappointed nonetheless.\n\nI noticed very distinct points in some maps such as Devil's Head (in the mine shaft) where S.T.E.V.E. (the robot whose protection is supposed to be the primary objective for the divers) will get stuck, constantly rammed by Makos who have invested in every speed and stamina perk. With no difference in damage dealt to S.T.E.V.E. between the different sharks, it can be very annoying.\n\nMy last complaint are the times that it will take you to find a server. My average wait time for a server is probably around a minute and a half. This may not seem so bad, but this is with no filters enabled at all except to play as diver. This means I was queued to join all of the available servers, play on any map, and on any game mode. In my experience with multiplayer games, it should not take more than a minute to find any available game. Again, this is a superficial issue that doesn't do too much to kill the gameplay.\n\nMy overall rating would have to be a 9/10. It is a phenomenal game with a phenomenal concept. If you don't have friends that have this game on their wish list, you should probably tell them about it, because believe me, they do. Is it a $25 dollar game? Maybe not. Could is use some smoothing out here and there? Just like every game can. Would I reccomend it? In half an instant.\n\n9/10 would pee myself again IGN.","March 24, 2015","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, don't be fooled! The sharks can become the hunted if played poorly.\n\nThe divers face challenging gameplay in often dark areas. You may be greedy at certain points to gather treasure away from the group, but hearing your heart beat in game faster and faster let's you know you've made a bad decision!\n\nBoth sides get the opportunity to upgrade and prepare for the next battle, too.\n\nOverall Depth gives an awesome experience that's well worth $25.","January 13, 2015","true","37.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumakurita/recommended/274940/","kumakurita","Hingle McCringleberry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumakurita/","131 products in account","This game first came to my attention via word of mouth and from youtube playthroughs mostly centering around Ohmwrecker and Gassymexican. For those of you who are on the fence on buying this game, I would like to highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a unique experience.\n\nI would describe Depth as a refreshing first person shooter with a good mix of survival aspects and teamwork (which opens up the opportunity for an overall fun experience with friends). The overall premise of the game as you can already probably notice is that there are two modes, the first one being "Blood and Gold" where four players play as divers who are seeking treasure in the underwater DEPTHS alongside an AI driven robot called STEVE while two other players play on an opposing geam as sharks (either Mako, Great white, and Tiger) ad the second mode being Megalodon hunt which essentially takes four divers vs a "huge" (not really huge as this was more of a design choice for easire movement) megalodon.\n\nThe movement and combat sytle for each team is great, and the mechanics of the game is well balanced with both teams having a set amoutn of 30 respawns they can burn through and sharks having specific skill perks you can purchase through your kill points, and divers having the opportunity to buy and earn better weapons through picking up treasure individually and delivering it to STEVE for the cash bonus.\nFrom shaking your mouse as a shark to tear divers apart once you grab hold of them, to replenishing health via eating seals, to the game taking advantage of what can be called "Drawing distance" to add suspense and adrenaline rushes as divers try to peer out into the distance or shadows searching for the other team before they strike (sharks distance in relation to a diver's position is relayed to you the player through the speed of heartbeats) Depth has a lot of unique elements that I enjoy.\n\nCompalints are that I can see some people not enjoying the fact that this game boils down to one specific formula of asymetric play which might bore people, but so far with the 10 hours I've put into the game I'm still really enjoying it and consider the game a great price for what I got out of it (I bought it during its week long discount of $14.99 but would recommend it still even at $24.99). Another complaint is that for a game with the visuals that Depth has, it strangely can be somewhat taxing on a system, as I believe TotalBiscuit pointed out himself on his own rig in his WTF is...)\n\nWhat it boils down to, is that if you really enjoyed L4D2 multiplayer, or are greatly interested in Evolve for its unique gameplay, then you'll really enjoy Depth.","January 14, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But that is where this game shines,insted of tryhards and squekers there is a friendly and helpful community that are very nice people whiche is a breath of fresh air from something like counter strike where it is littered with them. Also the game does deliver on promises by being fun,scary,tense,alot of fun with friends,and how polished it is,that is a recipe for a great game you can sink hours into. Here's what im gonna say if you like team based multiplayer shooters like counter strike you might like this and since it's early access they are gonna add more modes,maps,weapons,and other cool stuff that i can't wait to play,so if you see this in a sale like i did i would suggest you pick this up.","January 13, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So many days ruined. My friends jokingly ask if I'm "hungry" or if I want "a snack" when asking if I'm up to play this game. I always am. Depth is an asymmetrical team-based shooter with sharks vs divers. Essentially, it's what Evolve wishes it could be. There are different sharks, like the tanky great white or the speedy mako. There are various shark upgrades like rapid health regeneration after eating a diver. The sharks don't have it easy, though. Divers protect a robot that opens up deep-sea safes around the map, netting them cash to use on new weapons. gear, and upgrades. Harpoon guns, underwater machine guns, poison rounds, mobile turrets, and a myriad of other tools are at the divers' disposal to fend off the sharks until S.T.E.V.E. is done with the safes. The devs update this game every few months, adding more of everything there is to love. Over more than a year after release, they have changed Depth from a limited-playstyle gimmick to a full fleshed out game with countless hours of fun.","March 18","true","78.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
