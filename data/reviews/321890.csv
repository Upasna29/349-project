THIS GAME WILL REVEAL MANY PLOT SPOILERS FOR THE PREVIOUS PARTS AND A COHESIVE STORY CAN ONLY BE FORMED WITH THE PLAYING OF THE OTHER 3 GAMES IN THE SERIES.\nAveyond: The Darkthrop Prophecy is the fourth and final installment in the 4-part series of games that make up Aveyond 3. Don't start with this one, as you'll be missing TONS of backstory. Instead, buy Lord of Twilight first, Gates of Night second, and The Lost Orb third... And finally this one.\nNow, I've been following the Aveyond series for several years, back since the first game in 2004 (which doesn't go under the title of "Aveyond", instead; it's called "Ahriman's Prophecy", and it's free from their site, aveyond.com). I was young, the game was cool, so I stuck with the series. In 2006, the actual Aveyond was released and I was stoked. More of AP? Nice! However, Aveyond 1 was completely different from it's predecessor in the best way possible... Fast forward to today, with me writing this review.\nNow, I've had this game for a while. Not on Steam, but from somewhere else, so I've played through it a few times before, so this isn't a "first-time playthrough" review or anything. But without further ado, let's get on to the actual review.\nAveyond: The Darkthrop Prophecy is a great game from a great team of people. It's got a ton of pros... But also it's fair share of cons. I'll list them all out for you, dear reader.\nPROS:\n+Decent price\n+Decent gameplay\n+Great story (if you've been following since Lord of Twilight)\n+Custom music (not all of the music is build-in RPG Maker music, as one could expect)\n+Difficulty selection\n+Nostalgia factor (for the select few who played the first Aveyond)\n+Combat just works\n+Dat plot twist at the end (again, you'll have to have played LoT to understand)\nCONS:\n-RPG Maker... XP.\nBefore we go any further, I want to explain why this is a con in detail. Aveyond, the series as a whole, while a great series, is all RPG Maker XP. All of it. From Aveyond 1 (not it's prequel Ahriman's Prophecy, however) to this most current one, Aveyond has been an RPG Maker XP game. After 4 years of making games with RPG Maker XP, you think they'd at least move onto RPG Maker VX Ace (which is what I use), but no. Not even a slight upgrade. Don't get me wrong, there isn't nothing wrong with RPG Maker XP itself (besides its dated-ness) but having a whole series of 7 games be all made in a program that was just barely considered "new" at the time of the first game's release is just baffling.\nNow back to the rest of the cons...\n-Cannot change screen resolution\n-Can be confusing to those who never played any of the other parts of Aveyond 3\n-Controls can be awkward\n-Moves a bit slow\nAll in all, I will recommend this game. But please, before you spend $10 on this, buy the others. At least get Lord of Twilight to start you off.","March 30, 2015","true","10.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","18","22","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/321890/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","After destroying the Orb of Death, Mel decided to hide into the animal village with Yvette and Ulf. However, she's still denying her magic powers. Never relentess, Edward, ousted of his throne by Lydia, found her and convinced her to go to the Shadowood Academy to control them. But Gwendyal isn't done with the Darkthrop heiress... Mel being in danger, it's up to Stella and Edward to reunite with Galahad and Te'ijal, still bitter about being an human again. However, Nox, that tricked Mel in her previous adventure, is also reappearing, with Uma, a light mage. And Yemite, the little darkling servant, will also join the battle...\n\nAveyond 3 was fragmented in four chapters. This one is concluding the story and it's still well-written and full of humor: Ulf and Yvette make an appearance though they're not going to join the fight, Mel is still full of sarcasm, Edward is still crushing on her and prompt to go to her rescue, Te'ijal and Galahad are still fighting like the married couple they are and Stella is still the na√Øve healer. Given the fact that the game is putting you in charge of two different teams (Mel in the Demon Realm and her friends trying to save her in the overworld), you will have new characters joining: Nox and Uma, two mages, a dark one and a light one, that are strongly connected as a Darkling named Yemite, that will be in both teams. Nox and Uma are bickering though are agreeing that they have to help Mel to survive (Nox letting her desire to make sure that Mel will rule the world on the side for her own fate) and Yemite is very happy to serve Mel.\n\nHowever, while I don't mind the fact that you have two teams, I didn't really enjoyed that fact. I mean; Nox and Uma were really helpful and loosing them made me sad, even for the sake of the story. After that, loosing Galahad and Mel and letting only a team of 3 to conclude the story is also very annoying. Even if well-written, I lost the exciting rush of the two first games, with so many places to visit. Here, the world is kinda small compared.\n\nThe game mechanics are still the same and it's the HUD from the Lost Orb that is featured. However, the leveling of spells by fighting and the alchemist feature disappear. Now, you have Edward with a Shard that can be upgraded in Sword Station with some choices to make (as he can also use spells through the sword) and Stella learning a skill by wearing a new staff. They're the ones that are only affected by this new way of playing.\n\nSome quests needs to be done in order to advance in the story, while they're appearing as being a side-quest just for the money. Others are just bonus. But given the fact that you need money to buy stuff, any quest is worthy. You can also spare your money because fast-travel is totally disabled, apart the Reaper, as you need to go to the vampire town.\n\nYou can a new pirate ship but you don't have many docks to use. True, in Gates of Nights, you didn't have many islands too. But you had a large  choice of docks, at least for the Mainland. Besides, during the story, you'll acquire a dragon and it will be more useful to use it than the ship itself.\n\nAveyond comes also with three difficulties: Easy where you're stronger and where most of the enemies don't spawn again after a defeat (yeah, I'm playing in this difficulty), Normal where every is balanced and Hard where you'll die more frequently - though even in Easy, I've been wiped. Well, if a character dies, you can ressucitate them but if your team is wiped, it's game over and it's up to you to load the auto-save (when entering a new screen) or a save of yours.\n\nI'm wondering why I can import my previous save because once launched, Mel lost all her levels, all her gears. It's the same for Edward, it's the same for Stella... and for my gold. I had to begin with a pouch of 0 gold. Nothing. I could have begin a new quest and see no difference (apart perhaps the chicken dance). Stella had to learn everything back! I wasn't happy about that.\n\nAveyond dates from 2009-10 and from an earlier version of RPG Maker but the graphisms are still good. Besides, the landscapes are still varied: the vampire town, Thais (though at the end), the isles (with a swamp setting for one, a forest for another one and a snowy land for the third), Aveyond, Underfall (another come back, like the tomb of the goddess from the previous game) and even a Demon Realm.\n\nI thought it was a short game when in reality, I've passed 12 hours in it. But if it seems so short, it's probably because of the two teams feature.\n\nAveyond 3-4 is concluding the saga of Mel, but I feel like this game was rushed. I've lost the rush from the two first games, maybe because I was expecting to come back to the mainland and other locations visited. I was expecting to have a full team of six, I never had it and worse, I had to finish with 3 of them. Uma and Nox didn't stay for long, which is a pity. True, there are some puzzles in the game now. But it's not saving the game from a disappointment for my part. However, if you want the whole Aveyond 3 experience, you need to buy this one. Besides, you don't want to miss Galahad and Te'ijal bickering, eh? Or Edward that still need to marry as his previous wedding was revoked?","March 10","true","12.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Everything cost an arm and a leg, some creatures just refused to DIE, the resistance some enemies had to my weapons that I bought in the area confused me to no end... and worst of all, the people in this game got smart. Normally I can just go into people's houses in any town, hit up about five or so houses and loot them right in front of the owner's faces! And they'd be perfectly fine with it! But now there's not  as much to steal... and they complain when I try. But the pickings are still sparse, they've heard I'm coming to town, so they hid all their valuables.\nLike the slime farmer! Every time I visited him, I stole all of his slime. All of it. And never used a single one. If this game taught me one thing, it was that you should never leave your stuff around me. I will steal ALL your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Even if I don't need it, I will steal all your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\nAnd when I saw Nox for the first time, I thought she was annoying, then I saw her character art. SHE IS SO CUTE! Don't even get me started on Uma. Too much cute, not enough money.\nSeriously though, if you get this game there will be a LOT of walking because there is no longer a magical transporter, there is no more alchemy that YOU can do, and say goodbye to the Moo Hatchery. The game is challenging enough to give you a good amount of gameplay and the story is awesome~! These are my thoughts, now the choice lies with you.","May 28, 2015","true","12.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","7","8","5","0"

Spells actually matter. And you will run into large enough groups that their AoE will be even more favorable. There is some planning beyond Trip boss -> Normal attack everything unless a heal is needed.\n\nGear can be hard to gain like the 3rd game. Expect to farm a lot if you want to keep your gear up. And sometimes you'll have to. Not something I'm too fond of. This isn't an MMO that is gated by heavy farming. Some is OK. But it shouldn't be a chore in this kind of game.\n\nThere is almost no easy travling in this game(you get a ship and a dragon, which have very limited places they can stop and moslty only exist because you can't get to the other places without them.). Which can be a pain as you go back and forth quite a bit between places. With larger monster groups and a harder time to gear up you can end up finding yourself fighting a lot of pointless battles. Not a horrible thing. It just gets to me a little after having to grind an area, I just want to avoid all of it after that.\n\nQuesting can be a pain. The creater has gotten very good at hiding areas. Which I like. Only thing I dislike about the hiding is the chests. You'll walk past a lot of blue chests before you get the key to open them. Kind of makes all the exploring feel unrewarding knowing you'll have to do it again. Topped off with the grinding.\n\nOverall once you get used to the grinding(or just take the gold goodies cave and save yourself the headach) you'll find a very well polished RPG. Playing all 4 chapters shows how they've progressed in their understanding of making these games.\n\nI know I put a lot more negative than positive. But I really hate grinding when it feels like a chore. >.<","November 10, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
