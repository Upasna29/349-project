I had a terrible issue where the frame rate would just tank all the time, wasn't because of my rig as it is good enough for this game.\n\nPosted on the forums, had a terrible feeling we were getting another shoddy pc port of a game, dev replied within minutes of me bringing up the issue and told me how to fix it for the mean time and that there would be a patch in the next day that would fix the issue completely.\n\nSo the quick fix worked and true to the devs word a patch was released the next day that took care of the glitch and there were no more frame drops.\n\nNow to the review itself. Big Ant and Tru Blu really do have to be commended for the product that they've released. As a small time dev and publisher they've released a game that can be held in the same regard as fifa and the 2k series, despite the modest budget that they had to work with.\n\nEverything about the game of rugby league is captured in this digital rendition. Players behave like they should, they move like they should, and they mostly look like their real life counter parts.\n\nThe game has all of the official players and teams for the southern hemisphere but not for the North, depending on where you live this is either going to be a problem or not one at all, and even in saying that, there is the awesome fan hub which allows you to download created players that other people have made, some of them are truley awesome and look like the real people they are based off of, so getting the right players for the northen hemisphere should be no trouble at all.\n\nThe game has all the usual content you'd expect from a sports game. Quick match, online, career and so on, but it's the options like being able to take control of your favourite superstar and guide him through his career or take a rookie from the age grades on up to representative footy that make this game even more fun than it already is.\n\nDuring your season you will be faced with optional challenges to raise your clubs finances, like completing so many tackles or fends in a match, these finances help when you're trying to lure the next super star to your club for the next season as you have players coming off contract, but these optional challenges are not actually required for you to be able to recruit and don't break the game in anyway.\n\nYou'll also have the a few judiciary hearings along the way as no doubt your players are going to get pinged for wreckless tackles and face suspension, another facet of the game that just adds to the realism, being able to decide how you plead is icing on the cake\n\nThe graphics for this game are really good, the game has amazing IQ and is capable of supporting 4k resolution should you have the machine capable of running it.\n\nThe commentary is sadly mostly the same as the Rugby League Live 2 with Andrew Voss and Gus calling the plays, It's not too bad and is actually a lot better than other games that you'll play\n\nThe sound is great at capturing the atmosphere of a real life footy game. What with the sound of the excited fans the explosions of fire works when someone goes over for a try or when a forward crunches into a would be tackler, and it's even better with a good pair of headphones.\n\nIf there was one negative that really needs to brought to attention it'd be the fact that the game has to be online to be played. I can understand why the dev and publisher took this route though, League is niche game and piracy eating into already small sales would cripple this franchise and bring about the end of future pc releases.\n\nAll in all this is a fantastic sports game and shouldn't be avoided if you're a fan of League. Even comparing this game to the rugby union games that have been released in recent months and years just shows that you don't need a "AAA" budget to accuratley capture the heart and soul of  a game, just a dev that wants to please the fans and put out something that they're proud off.\n\nI have no doubt that Big Ant and Tru Blu are very proud of this, and they have every right to be.","October 1, 2015","true","130.2"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","61","67","5","4"

The PC version of this game feels so much better for some reason. The graphics look crisp and nice and the game takes a bit to learn but once you get the hang of it you will have a lot of fun. There are a lot of game modes and the Be a Pro Career / Coach Career modes will keep you going for a long time. One of the things that I love about Big Ant is that they continuously support their game with patches. Don Bradman Cricket 14 still gets updates more than a year after its release and fixed many issues and added wonderful gameplay. So if there are bugs in Rugby League Live 3 they WILL be fixed by Big Ant. On the whole the miniscule issues do not detract from the gameplay and fun experience.","September 29, 2015","true","18.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","2"

Overall they got it right, tackles have weight to them, you can produce fantastic and interesting plays to score an amazing try.  Some minor problems with the defence, the AI can sometime cut through your defence like a knife through butter, but im sure with additional patches this will improve. The career mode is fantastic and versitile. The difficulty levels are very challenging, not like fifa where you can have it on the hardest difficulty after 2 weeks. After amateur you will be at pro level for quite a while.\n\nYou can pick your favourite super league or nfl team and win all the trophies or you can pick teams from 2 leagues below and work your way up... plenty to do. The customisation on this game is fantastic and really is a huge selling point. With the ability to create players, referees and even whole teams then share them throughout the online community.\n\nMissed opportunities - Cannot create plays.  This would of been a great touch, to be able to create runs and markers ect. It lost marks on its defencive play, no world cup option and the main one - Ive NEVER played an online match because no matches are ever available.

The inclusion to add community created teams and players is excellent.\n\nI love the indepth player a team customisation as well as the facilities to create custom leagues and tournaments.\n\nHowever the gameplay in matches is not all that great, the passing is hit and miss especially when a quick pass is needed, you'll find your player just carry on running rather than pass or pass many times in quick succsession if the controller is pressed again when a pass command is ignored.\n\nAlternativly when you are on a break the opposing AI can grab you at any angle, going from facing the wrong way to an instant 180 and bringing you down. The few feet between players is ignored allowing the opposing team to morph the gap and grab you, allowing no real pacing breaks or runs. Because this isn't Union there is only 5 attempts per passge to try and get a run going. Another dead option is the drop ball, if you manage to catch the high ball your player is instantly barraged and the sloppy pass system means you lose a passage of play.\n\nThere needs to be an auto player switch on tackles or at very least an overhaul. It takes a lot of learning to get the right player in the right place and make the tackle, a little automated help would go a long way as it really interupts the flow of the game. The manual switching especially at harder difficulties is pretty shambolic, finding a lot of times a breaking run will occur because the switching has skipped the last player in play, frantically watching your player marker skip through the entire team. There is an option to skip to player closest to the ball but i find myself wondering what ball the computer thinks is in play, most of the time i'm running at the ball boy.\n\nThe tutorial section is more like a challenge section with not enough of the games basics covered, a practice zone would of been better suited. With a game featuring this many rules and possible plays, a tutorial is a must, especially how to change the tactics which are scarcely mentioned. Look in the options for gameplay controls and find all the buttons and what kicks you can perform in there, this does a better job teaching you the game than the tutorial section.\n\nThere is a humungous leap in difficulty from Rookie to Amature, it feels like beginner to pro in one quick leap, offering no subtle difficulty change meaning you will jump from dominating with no retaliation to instantly held and losing.\n\nI'd recommend it but it isn't perfect by any stretch and i hope some changes are made.","November 1, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Okay it may have its fair share of bugs and annoying glithes but none of that matters because this is the perfect representation of Rugby League in game form ever made. I love the new inclusion of Player Carrer where you can take a rookie player from the lowest of leagues (even the Kingstone league one, oh yeah I'm English by the way) all the way to the top and represent your home nation. Mentioning myself being English leads me onto one slight downside of the game, Why are Super League teams so lowly rated? Don't get me  wrong, I understand that the Super League isn't level with the NRL but seeing teams like St.Helens; Wigan Warriors; and Warrington Wolves so poorly rated compared to lower end NRL teams annoys me, hopefully this may be fixed by a roster update sometime in the future. I know in reallity that this game isn't on par with other top end sports games but it has give me hours of pure entertainment and I'm sure it will continue to for years to come. In conclusion, I would recommend this game to any fan of Rugby League, no matter their location in the world (How are England only rated 3 1/2 stars? We even just showed New Zealand how to really play the other week :-D ) Yes the price is a little steep, but to me it was worth every penny, if you prefer wait till it comes on sale, but please give it a go because I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much as I do!","November 5, 2015","true","41.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The difference between Rookie (the lowest) and Amateur (the next one up) is like the difference between fighting a baby cat and a full grown tiger, and there's like four more difficulties on top of that. I only tried playing on Legend (the highest) for about twenty minutes. If you can play and win on Legend regularly, try to contact either Mal Meninga or Laurie Daley as you are probably qualified to play in the next State of Origin (Please be advised that you must be from NSW to apply for the NSW Origin team. State restrictions do not apply in QLD.)\n\nTutorials are horrendously poor. If you aren't already very familiar with the rules, field positions and basic strategy of Rugby League, this game will make no effort to teach you. The 'drills' are presented as training, but in actual fact they are more like particularly difficult challenges no new player in their right mind will be able to accomplish. They are quite fun to go back and attempt after a bit of experience, though.\n\nVery minor occasional graphical glitches, like the player's foot sometimes getting stuck in the pitch and shaking as the game tries to decide whether you should be in the ground or on it. This so far has not affected gameplay and is a purely cosmetic issue.","October 29, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The menus and presentation are slick and apart from a couple of very minor UI issues (like why would I want to play as any other team during career mode? Why do I have to keep rechoosing my team each week?) but these are all minor and the devs seem to be patching already (day one).\n\nThe graphics are stunning, and it all runs very smoothly (over 100fps on my GTX970)\n\nI'd go as far as to say this looks and feels like a FIFA or 2K title.\n\nThe gameplay is tough and whilst there are Drills which help improve the basics you'll have to figure out the rules and tactics of the game as you go along.\n\nIt has all the key elements of a modern sports sim, with a My Player career mode, coach career mode, exhibitions, leagues and multiplayer etc.\n\nThe sound is pretty realistic and on the whole very authentic, with some great bone crunching tackles. The commentators aren't quite as varied as their FIFA/2K counterparts but they are a million times better than Blood Bowl 2...\n\nIf you follow Rugby League I'm guessing you aren't reading this because you're too busy playing this game, if you like sports games but aren't sure about League or this game you should jump in!\n\n","October 1, 2015","true","30.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I will add I have never played a RL game before More of a Union fan.\n\nHowever as there is NO decent RU games out there I gave this a try and was So So happy I did.\n\nPositives:\n1.Graphics are great comparable to any AAA sports title. I have had no drop in FPS or any issues with a 3 year old rig on higher settings.\n\n2.Gameplay is smooth and as far as I am aware pretty accurate to RL play style. tackles are fun and you haev a lot of options of set plays and tactical calls re defence alignment etc.\n\n3.Content - the create a player most games have these days its as detailed as I would want without being over the top. Carrer mode can swap between manager, existing "superstar" or your created player which gives it a fresh take.\n\nCons:\n\nVery few. However if I was being picky.\n\n1. Key mapping/bindings I am happy playing with a controller but I would have thought its not challenging to allow me to alter my controls. I usually play with Keyboard but without key mapping its impossible. Key mapping on controller perhaps not as important but would be preferred.\n\n2. Attacking set plays: such as Switch, loop moves and miss moves. You can elect to throw a pass 1, 2,or 3 players out but thats it really. Considering there is defensive tactical alignment and altering defensive lines etc I would have hoped for a slightly more detailed attacking system. currently the attacking "set play" consists of two types of backline set up for kicking options Thats it. The rest is free for all.\n\nOverall though its a really fun game with a lot of content, completely meets my needs for a rugby fix. Would recommend.","October 8, 2015","true","109.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Similarly, if you are a RU fan you might want to take a look at this.  I got the Lomu Rugby Challenge and loved that, despite me being a RL bigot first and foremost.  This compares very favourably with that.\n\nPros\n+ Easy to pick up\n+ Vast array of teams and stadiums\n+ Can create your own teams and rosters. Loads of options for team kits.\n+ On harder levels the game feels more like RL i.e. battling for field position, territory.  The realism is getting better with each patch\n+ Good developers who listen and support the product. They've already made positive changes to the game e.g. the AI doesn't fling the ball around as much as they first did.\n\nNeither good nor bad\n* Career mode is solid although not much depth to it\n* Playing a season is good but game doesn't have the depth of ageing, youth development etc. that you get with the multi-million pound projects like FIFA, but that's a minor issue considering how desperate I was for a decent rugby game)\n\nCons\n- Occasional squad and roster disruptions when you download teams (this can be remedied by deleting official clubs which returns the squad back to its default state)\n- Some player look-a-likes aren't that great (this is more of an issue with the UK teams, which I'm more familiar)\n- Player ratings in the Super League a bit out of date e.g. Alex Walmsley rated 79 (minor quibble though that)\n- Custom players seems to be an issue as I can't create new ones\n\nOverall I love it.

The game on PC really puts the console versions to shame. The visuals are absolutely stunning, esp with Sweetfx enabled. The grass in particular is the best I have seen of any sports game, and the created players really come to life. In terms of eye candy, you simply could not ask for any more. The gameplay is extremely smooth and responsive, and it runs perfectly all settings maxed out on my fairly moderate system.\nThis game has real depth and the more you play it, the more you realise just how much of a simulation it is. The ball physics in partcular are first class. I feel that the compeition options and customisation could be a bit more expansive like DBC, but hopefully this will be added down the line in patches etc. The fanhub is again the best player creator I have seen to date, and with enough time and patience, it is possible to create players who really look authentic, visually. BUT.......I personally do not like everything about the way the stats system is done. I realise they did it this way to prevent cheating and having super players, but as it stands you are not able to create players with their unique and specific skill set. Many people have voiced their concern about this on the forums, and seeing as Big Ant are great listeners to the public, I hope that this will be changed in a patch, so that we can alter the stats individually, so that each player has a true to life representation of their skill set.\nAnother area where the PC version shines is in the modding department. Already we can load custom Jerseys and Logos, but hopefully this will be greatly expanded down the line, to include Balls, Referee Kits, Field Markings, Adboards, Crowd Clothing etc. The mere possibility is extremely mouthwatering and adds such great authenticty, especially for the retro/classic content.\nSo is it worth getting the PC version.....ABSOLUTELY!!!!! Why? The visuals are far more stunning, it runs alot smoother, the mods will be epic AND it will see alot more patches and support (ala DBC).\nThe lads at Big Ant deserve a medal for this masterpiece and I know with a little fine tuning and expanded options and mods it will be the ultimate Rugby League gaming experience. A wonderful company who really care about what the fans think and their willingness to listen and support is second to none.\nFor those of you baulking at getting the PC version.....IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!","October 1, 2015","true","358.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If I had a choice of both yes and no, then that's the choice to make.\n\n- Poor AI\n- Lack of basics like adding players to tackles (vital defending line)\n- No knock ons in tackles\n- Poor running lines that inevitably lead to forward passes\n- Players watching ball on the ground\n- Kick off that sometimes work and sometimes don't\n- Props running length of field palming off every player\n- Heat-Seeking single kick chasers\n- Full length simulated games ending in scores of 140-60\n\nIf you want to play against others, then it's ideal rugby league game.   If you want to play any other aspects on any difficulty level higher than amateur walkover you'll want to chuck the controller in frustration.\n\nRealistically though, Mitchell Pierce can't tackle...","April 22","false","23.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I cannot play the game! It loads up fine and i can negotiate the menus, however as soon as i try to play a match or do anything that means using the game for it's full purpose cause the gamr to crash/close. It's definitely not a pc spec problem as i've checked everything thoroughly. It must be another problem but i don't know what!","December 4, 2015","false","1.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Using heavy hits compared to normal tackles there is no difference in the long run. You wont injure or tire the other players.\nThe enemy team will change defensive and offensive strats to lock a player down. Your team wont.\nHit ups are just stupid. You can run straight at another player and knock him down but in the time it takes for the animations to play you will get tackled everytime. You can't just run over them and keep going.\nYou can get ball stripped from you but it is near impossible to strip the ball yourself.\nThe script for tackling your player for enemy team can trigger from 10-15 metres away so you can't avoid tackle at all. Often the script for enemy tackling you will over ride the script for you passing even though you will have planty of time to pass.\nRunning into a pass from a team mate will nearly always trigger a forward pass. This needs fixing bad.\nThe career mode has had no effort put into it. I'll give some examples. In NBA2k games and other games you take interviews after matches and talk to other player and cinematics trigger during career decisions. You get none of that here.\nI'd give this game a 4/10 even being a footy fan. Not worth the $40 I paid. Maybe worth about $10.","April 19","false","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
