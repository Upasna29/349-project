Options include subtitles, game cursor, additional help, and hotspot indicator under Game; screen resolution from 640x480 up to 1920x1080, gamma (brightness), and quality under "Graph."; and separate sliders for general, music, speech, effects, and environment.\n\nThis is a classic point-and-click style adventure game, hence you'll need to save manually.  I completely forgot about this until the moment I got killed, and that sinking feeling of, "Oh no... do I have to do all of that again? *faint* " was quickly dispelled by the game's auto-save (blessed be!)  Still, to be safe, I HIGHLY recommend saving often!\n\nOne irritation that I frequently see voiced about this kind of adventure is that the characters walk. so. slowly.  Not an issue in this game!   Your character automatically runs anywhere you click on the screen, and you can double-click on exits to skip the running altogether.\n\nThe game progresses via voiced-over, simple cutscenes, whilst the rest of the graphics are quite detailed and lovely to look at.  The voices are done well, but the music annoyed me.  Good thing we have those sliders for the sounds!\n\nThere are a few issues with the subtitles, in that sometimes the actors aren't saying exactly what's written on the screen.  It's a bit jarring when it comes up, but not so much that I wanted to turn off the subtitles.\n\nInteractions with other characters are pretty straightforward -- click on them to talk to them, then choose an image that represents what you'd like to talk about.  Our character's text is white, whilst other characters have their own colors.  Very nice, as it helps you distinguish who's talking, on the off chance that you don't recognize their voice.  You don't have to wait for the people to finish speaking if you're a fast reader -- simply click anywhere to move the conversation along.\n\nBring your cursor to the bottom of the screen to see your inventory, and to the top of the screen to see the options there:  Magnifying glass (hotspot indicator), Papers (save/load game), and a Book (your diary.)  Sadly, the diary sometimes mentions things that you haven't discovered yet, so I only read it occasionally.\n\nYour inventory is easily managed.  Hover your mouse over an item to see the object's title (ie. carved stone,) and right-click to examine it more closely or to consume it.  Grab something from your inventory and drop it on another item to combine them.  If you'd like to save some time, anywhere you can use an object -- whether it's a specific place on the screen or by combining it -- the cursor will gradually turn red when it's an action you can take.  For instance (completely made up, this isn't a spoiler,) say you have a loaf of bread and a knife in your inventory.  Grab the knife, hold it over the loaf of bread, and if if you need sliced bread for something, the cursor will start to turn red.  You could just drop it on the loaf of bread and skip that entirely, but when you have 15 things in your possession, and you're not sure what you're supposed to be doing, it's a real time-saver! :D\n\nI played without extra help (although I did have to use the hotspot indicator), and all of the tasks I was able to figure out eventually. This is a game with mostly-logical actions, which is something I highly appreciate!  My one point of contention is that sometimes I would find something I KNEW I needed to interact with, but nothing in my inventory worked!  Save yourself some frustration, and click on interesting areas more than once to see if anything changes.  Wish I'd known that sooner!\n\nThis, like most point-and-click adventures, is a slow-paced game, though it does have its moments.  The story is interesting enough, and the devs did a pretty good job keeping anachronisms out of the game.\n\nThis was a nice stop-down from the action-adventures I've been playing lately.  I'd say it's definitely worth playing. :)","February 21, 2015","true","13.7"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","42","47","2","1"

If you haven’t discovered this gem yet, I suggest buying it.\n\nLong version:Lost Chronicles of Zerzura is one of those point ‘n’ click adventure games practically nobody heard of. It was made by the same company that created the Guild series, and their love for post-classical age European history shows in the early 16th century Spanish and Northern African settings.\n\nThe story starts in Spain, in the era when the iron fist of the Inquisition was stronger than any other authority, where we meet an inventor who tries to build the first flying machine… something that doesn’t bode well in this environment. The focus is not on the science versus religion aspect though but the classic adventure feeling. There is everything you can think of, starting with a search for a lost city, to a sea battle, pirates, prison break-in, and of course some clue gathering at ancient Egyptian sites and a secular mountain monastery. All completed with a mandatory spunky female love interest and a few other stock characters.\nBut it is not cheesy; everything is handled seriously from plot elements to scenes and characters, and the absolutely gorgeous hand-drawn scenery.\n\nThe game uses simple mechanics to advance: you gather items and use them with each other or with certain scene elements. Most of the tasks are fairly logical, so it is easy to keep pace. Even when you need some guesswork, it is unlikely to get stuck for long.\n\nIf this originally German-only title would have seen the international market a lot sooner, it really could have been a classic among adventure gamers. Too bad it was this late to the scene.","August 7, 2015","true","11.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

On seeing its logo you might suspect it to be a hidden object game. But is a point and click adventure with a reasonable plot and length of playtime.\n\nThe game is based around two young men around 20 years old in Spain during the time of the Inquisition. One of them fancies himself as a competitior to Leonardo Da Vinci. Lots of the puzzles are centered around him inventing things. His brother is early on sought out by the Inquisition and the rest of the game is centered around the younger brother  finding him and then discovering why he was so persecuted.\n\nThe game mechanics are very much old adventure game style. You can talk with people to advance the plot, use objects together to create new devices and use things in your inventory with objects in the environment to help your character.\n\nBest points:\nThe graphics are really quite pretty.\nUseful highlighting of hot spots.\nThe soundtrack is nothing exceptional but decent.\nThe voice acting for the English version is really very good.\nThe plot is engaging until just before the end. The ending itself is a bit dull.\n\nWorst points:\nThe main character thinks he's some kind of genius of invention but the puzzle solutions involve some bad, bad ideas. People that understand Physics and Engineering need to prepare themselves for covering their eyes and forgiving the writers.\nThe main character needs an injection of personality.\nThe main character develops a disturbing case of Stockholm syndrome which makes a small chunk of the game just feel weird.\n\nIn summary: The game's main flaws are the about main character but he isn't too annoying to stop the game being worth buying. It's an above mediocre point and click with good production but occasionally mad puzzle design.\n\n\n\n","November 19, 2014","true","19.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

The setting is simply great, and all the little details are really amazing. I highly recommend this game to any adventure game enthusiast, or even causual gamers who like a good story with some challenging, but solvable puzzles.\n\nIts tone is a little like lost Horizon (similar title with no relation), but the production value and art style of Zerzura is far more evolved.\n\nOverall, this is a great game that is well worth your time, even at full price, which is $10 cheaper then the boxed version.","July 11, 2014","true","2.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","1"

It doesn't look too bad. Initially I noticed a bit of contrast between the the 3D and 2D but these usually seemed to blend together most of the time. The game nice peaceful music playing at all times.\n\nIt's a point and click adventure problem solving game. You inspect objects, pick stuff up, use objects together to find solutions to problems. It is typical sort of stuff you in the genre.\n\nIt is not a fast game. You spend a lot of time listening to the protagonist's monologue about everything you try to do or look at. There is a lot trial an error finding solutions to objectives. Some of the dialogue is amusing; the protagonist is an inventor and does not speak kindly of Da Vinci who is a rival inventor for him. I kind of liked the part where you actually 'design' inventions by sitting down in the workshop and drawing sketches by combining ideas together. Some of them look pretty funny.\n\nThe game isn't too bad. I wouldn't of it's kind but I couldn't find any major problems with it. I would recommend is looking for games like this.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 10, 2014","true","0.8"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","22","34","0","2"

I bought this game more on a whim, because my first impression was it was a hidden object game. Very bad advertising work, nothing really charmed me into buying other than the fact that i am a hardcore adventure gamer and one of the trailers looked promising.\n\nThe game turned out to be a lot better than expected, a very enjoyable experience. The strongest point of the game are the puzzles, logical and entertaining. The story is not bad either, fitted with a nice historical angle, althoughcould have been a little more developed. Still, very entertaining and a must buy for all adventure lovers.","February 19, 2015","true","18.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You're an inventor that his brother is interested by Inquisition. The brother studies the artifacts that an uncle sends all the time as presents. Because of those the brother is arrested by the Inquisition and the story begins. In the start of the game you try to build the first flying machine ever and you finally do to escape the Inquisition. You try to save your brother. You travel to South Spain where you come across a girl, a pirate Captain's daughter. You travel with them and their ship was sunk by the Inquisition. The only survivors is you and the girl. You escape nearly to the pirates hide out and from there to Africa to save the brother, in the legendary "Tripoli" city and from there to the desert and Zerzura,the Lost White City, where they have the secret of immortality.\n\nIn your journey, you make inventions of the time trying to bypass things. The game is NOT difficult. For someone that has logic and played some adventures it will be incredibly easy. I finished it in 12 ours with the hotspots on. Someone that will NOT use the feature he'll may finish it in 14 hours. The game is really easy. Like many adventures of our time the game's target is to travel us and entertain us, not to stuck us on a riddle.\n\nA really minus is when the inquisition tries to arrest you several times and there you have time limit, as much the one move that you have to think of. In any other case the character is murdered in front of your eyes and the game exits in the menus. Before every scene of that kind there is an autosave and you just can press the Continue game option. So , don't bother. But the fact that you'll die many times before you find the solution is really irritating.\n\nThe graphics are 3D from every perspective. A modern game. Though ,you'll not find the best textures, the picture quality is really good and it even supports HD. There are NO cinematics in the cutscenes. That's a minus. Just the story teller that says some words and hand drawn sketches but no complete pictures. Like a cutscene but no cutscene at all. Let's say they didn't want to make the background just black in those few words that the storry teller says. Anyway, from  every other perspective the graphics are fine. When you take things or combine them , the style is like the older games. You just see the hands to move in most cases.\n\nThe sounds are not the best but are really good. The quality is of the voices fair as much as the speaking. Ok with the music,too.\n\nOne thing that I liked much is the saves speed. You really could NOT say that you really were saving a game. You pressed ok and it was instant. The computer never slowed down.\n\nWith an interesting story line and plot, good graphics, modern game features. I would say that we have to do with a very good game. Some could take it aside "Lost Horizon" because of the plot. But the last one is really MORE... As much is older the game promises more. "Lost Chronicles of Zerzura" in the other hand is made by people that make a good entry at this market.\n\nBut in any case you have to try it! It's really entertaining and the story line is sand box like,thing that make it really interesting!\n\nHAVE FUN!","January 15, 2015","true","12.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I only found one of them nonsensical enough to be really frustrating however, as for the most part things made plausible sense.\n\nAnother common problem with this type of game is pixelhunting, when some utterly insignificant part of the screen happens to contain an important hot-spot that is almost indistinguishable from it's surroundings. There a a couple of those in this game, like a small nail in a wall and a slightly irregular spot in the sand.\nThis is not a big deal though, because there is a hot-spot indicator in the game that you can turn on or off as you please.\n\nGraphically I'd say it's atmospheric and nice looking, but nothing to write home about. Some animations look a little silly or jerky from time to time, but there really isn't much movement going on aside from your charachter running around anyway, so no biggie.\n\nAs for audio, there is sound, and there is also music, none of it terrible or out of place and none of it particularly good.\nThe voice acting is mostly low key and imo mediocre, but not bad.\n\nThe story and writing is ok if you don't expect too much from it. The greatest weakness, I think, is that the characters are flat, predictable and uninteresting. Also, the ending is ridiculously underwhelming.\n\nNow, looking at this review, one might think this game is mediocre at best. Well, it may not be a masterpiece, but I found my playthrough enjoyable despite a few shortcomings. There are better games, yes, but there is also a ton of much worse ones. All in all it beats watching TV and if you get it on sale i'ts well worth the money.","September 28, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has beautiful 2d art with a surprisingly varied number of sets in many different locales. An enticing story placed just close enough to believable to preserve immersion while being whimsical enough to keep some air of mystery and curiousity.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty good in my opinion.  I'm sure the case could be made that some are too easy compared to other point and clicks but I found it refreshing that most of them actually made sense. Logic is usually enough to get though each scenario and only a couple of times did I need to resort to the "ol' rub everything I am currently carrying against everything in the environment 'till something happens" routine.\n\nThe mechanics are basically what you might expect and are solid.  My one very minor "gripe" in this regard may be the inventory which "auto-hides" a bit too quicly for my taste.\n\nThe character animations are fairly clunky at times with jarring walk/run animations and some oddly paced cut-scenes (ex. two characters having a sword fight loses some excitment when the swords clearly phase through eachother at odd movement speeds)  The voice acting is pretty good with a surprising amount of decently written dialog.  My only complaint here is the accents which don't always fit the character or the setting.\n\nIf you can grab it on sale like I did, there is quite a lot of value here.  My complaints are pretty minor and if you appreciate a good point and click which is "true to form"  you will enjoy Lost Chronicles of Zerzura.

As such it ends up being a stop often to consult the walkthrough simulator.\n\nThat would be O.K. if the story was good. But, there's not a lot to recommend that either. You have two orphaned brothers. One of whom, the main character, is an inventor. The other is trying to find their people's lost city. What's so important about this lost city? You know, magic, the falback choice for lazy writers everywhere.\n\nThere's the usual cartoonish villain who wants to get to the city also. And, there's a corsair woman who exists to be the main character's love interest, I guess, and to seek revenge for her father's death. I write "I guess" about the love interest thing because the game lets us know by giving you the option to have the main character give her some flowers, and, later, they receive a magical amulet, that neither of them asked for, that binds them together.
