I recommend you play with as many runners as possible.\n\nOverall I imagine this game will bring Mario Party levels of shouting and laughing to my house during a LAN party, particularly after we've all had a few drinks.","April 8","true","1.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

I have to hold LT to stop it from rolling but then I can't sprint...  Because of that, I can't recommend this game.","May 10","false","0.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","4","12","2","2"
