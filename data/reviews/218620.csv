"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auroadrunner/recommended/218620/","auroadrunner","AIRoadRunner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auroadrunner/","1319 products in account","Update: It appears that Starbreeze has purchased all the rights to their game and they are doing away with paid drills. This is a step in the right direction, but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before I can recommend the game.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nMy friend, Doctor Insano, said it better than I could...\n\nSo here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.\n\nThat time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release "We will not ever have microtransactions." And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.\n\nLast year, there were a series of "what's next" audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.\n\nLast year, we had "Crimefest," where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.\n\nLast year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were "FBI Files" (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.\n\nThis year, Overkill did a "Hype Train" event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get "hype-fuel" points. With enough "hype-fuel," rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this "Mask Pack 2.0." It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.\n\nAnd most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.\n\nOverkill, shame on you. I truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ♥♥♥ I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats. I truly hope your company goes out of business.","October 15, 2015","false","986.2"," 15,938 of 17,433 people (91%) found this review helpful 511 people found this review funny","91","938","17","511","108"

Yes i bought the completely Overkill Pack the DLC's and supported the game. But after microtransactions and more and more DLC's i had to give it a bad review. They were promising free content and instead we got paid DLC's and microtransactions. So Overkill will most likly go on with this trend of money making.\n\nDon't get me wrong its one of my favorite games. But if you are new do not buy it unless you are willing to spend more money on DLC's that will come out over time. Because even with a -75% sale on everything the game with everything costs ~33€. And after some time you maybe dont want to wait for a sale to get the newest DLC.\n\nSo what i want to tell you is that you will invest more money into the game. The content is good overall but you will have to pay more than you think.\n\nAlso playing with "publics" (people you don't know) can be pretty annoying. It's ok for a while but sometimes you just want a break from them.\n\nSo if you want to play it be ready to spend some money on DLC and maybe microtransactions (for Weapon Skins which are cosmetic) and get yourself into a group to play Payday with.","October 15, 2015","false","548.8"," 19,924 of 21,806 people (91%) found this review helpful 636 people found this review funny","91","924","21","636","241"

For now.\n\nEdit3: If you are a new player, I advise you to not look at Edit1, as it was created the same week as this review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashed/recommended/218620/","bashed","Bash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashed/","327 products in account","A money-obsessed pale imitation of the first game.\n\nPayday 1 was essentially "Left 4 Dead, except bank robbers." It's a simple formula that worked really well. The long, objective-rich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale. Gunplay was satisfying, enemies were challenging, and the DLC added a new class to screw around with. A few maps and secrets got updated as free updates.\n\nPayday 2 is nothing like the first game.\n\nThe sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game. In lieu of lengthy, interesting campaigns, each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives. Prepare to see the same areas, again and again. Stealth has been overemphasized across the board--killing yourself to restart is a common occurrence. The difficulty just isn't there compared to the first game, either. The matchmaking is also random gen and a complete mess--gone are the easy lobbies of the first game.\n\nIt gets worse! The unlock system is heavily dependent on RNG. Customization is RNG. Everything in this game is RNG except leveling.\n\nThe game has had DLC after DLC heaped on it. During a sale, it becomes a reasonable price.. when it's off sale expect to pay $50+ just to unlock a decent amount of content.\n\nThe game has blatant product placement. John Wick is shoved in your face as a free character. Why this doesn't get more negative feedback, I'll never know.\n\nThe new DLC came free of charge.. with a caveat. Now you can enjoy CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 crates, and pay $2.50 to unlock them. As if the game couldn't become more money-grubbing and obsessed with profit. Did I mention the crates are factored into the RNG loot, meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them, you can still lose out by getting them when you don't want them?\n\nGame use to have a modding community, too. Overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch. Maybe they'll fix this, I don't know.\n\nAm I against all DLC? Not at all. Plenty of games make great use of DLC. But herein lies my point. This is not a free-to-play game. This isn't a game in which the DLC is cosmetic. You have to pay for the game. Then the DLC, which encompasses characters, weapons, and campaigns, is also paid for. The game has product placement blatantly inserted into it. It then on top of that wants to insert microtranscations. This game has done everything it can to insert pay wall after pay wall.\n\nFor what should be a simple, Left 4 Dead style cooperative game, the amount of grind and pay-for-content in tis game is absolutely absurd.\n\nAll in all a disaster, right from the start. It just took some people longer to see that.","October 15, 2015","false","38.3"," 1,671 of 1,812 people (92%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","92","671","1","34","5"

Remember keys and crates from TF2 and CS:GO?  The same approach is being used here, but in adding this system, Overkill harshly nerfed all existing weapons - including those which players paid for as part of DLC packages.\n\nIn order to give players an incentive to pay for skins via microtransactions, existing equipment has been made insufficient to achieve the challenges that already existed in the game prior to the launch of this system.  We aren't being urged to buy microtransactions in order to take on more difficult challenges added alongside these new skins - we're being robbed of our existing tools, tools we earned through hours of gameplay or purchased for real money, and then sold a -chance- of regaining the same level of power we enjoyed previously.\n\nThere were plenty of good ways to add a skin system to a game like Payday 2.

I played a bit of the first game and thought it was an interesting new concept done well by an up-and-coming indie team. I was right. It was fun. PAYDAY was an enticing, original game that knew not to take itself too seriously. I very much liked the idea. The sequel did a great job of refining and expanding on the gameplay concepts that were introduced in the original; as well as elaborating on the purposely far-fetched story. I thought PAYDAY 2 was an amazing game. That all changed when PAY2WIN arrived...\nThey started with a few cheap DLCs. What's the harm, right? Pretty much all mainstream games release one or two payed downloadable content packs at some point, these days. It's a way of keeping the community interested by freshening up the game a little. I honestly prefer a few DLCs or expansions as opposed to releasing a new sequel every year just to make sure that society doesn't forget you exist (COD). However, I soon found out that what PAYDAY 2 had planned was far worse than anything Call of Duty has EVER done. Overkill released DLC after DLC after DLC after DLC. They just kept coming. Each one more "elaborate" than the last. If you call paying $5 for a stupid new overpowered weapon elaborate. They incessantly released plethoras of ridiculous content that had little to add to the game but give the purchaser a purpose-defeating advantage. They're essentially payed cheat codes, in the sense that a lot of these DLCs pretty much make the game EZ mode. I honestly think that Overkill does not give a ♥♥♥♥ about their "community" anymore. All they seem to know or care about these days is that DLC=$$$. What really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the ♥♥♥♥ off is this new "Black Market Update" or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they called it. It's literally a copy-paste of the Arms Deal Update from CS:GO. LITERALLY THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING THING. I mean I understand that they're purposely making this update resemble Counter-Strike, but I don't get why. Obviously it's because CS:GO keys and crates have made Valve a fortune, but what's with the unapologetic rip-off of Valve's style? Are they trying to be ironic? Because it's not ironic. It's not funny, or witty, or clever, or even mildly amusing. The whole update was completely unnecessary and just makes Overkill look like the money-grubbing sleazeballs that they obviously are. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE. A couple of years ago, I would have told all of my friends about how fun and original PAYDAY 2 was, and I did; but this game and its devs are garbage now.

The difference is that PD2 is a paid game and those skins actually boost some stats.\n\nAdding microtransactions was something they said they never would do.\nDeveloper can't keep their word:\n...We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!) and...\n> http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521\n\nThey launched a "weapon rebalance" patch with the excuse to increase diversity and versatily of other weapons. The thing is, with some stats being nerfed and stats boost added to skins, seems like a clear move from them to incite people buying those skins.\n\nPistols making more damage than heavy shotguns and assault rifles. What is this nonsense? To bring some shotguns back to their level before the "rebalance patch" you have to use special ammo, that is a feature of Gage Shotgun Pack, a DLC that wasn't required now is.\n\nIn the process of updating their game, popular mods were killed because OVERKILL made changes on how the game worked with LUA modification scripts. OVERKILL claims that breaking mods was not intentional. But how can you trust someone's word if they went back on it already? Call it conspiracy theory but maybe they just wanted to protect their new investment (microtransactions) to prevent malicious scripts from tampering with the game and finding a way to get easy safe card drops. Now it's gonna take a lot of unpaid effort from modders to get things working again, or maybe those mods will be just dead.\n\nMods are in the process of being fixed. Several of them are working again. Unfortunately some good modders got disgusted by recent OVERKILL choices and abandoned their mods :(\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nOld review:\n\nVery good game to play Co-Op with friends. Even playing with random people can be fun. Playing solo is usually not fun (I think solo play is suitable for stealth), but it's not the idea of the game. Some heists you can go loud or stealth, which renders a unique course as the heist takes place, or you can even do some of the heist in stealth and the rest loud. Could have more missions although they have some variation from time to time, It's a good thing that the developer is always launching new patches with improvements and bug fixes.\n\nSince the Death Wish patch, despite adding a new difficulty and some particular changes to the heists some aspects of the game were changed. Some of those changes modified the way certain skills worked and how they were implemented, and the most dramatic change was to the Stealth mechanics. I think those changes balanced the game better, in some ways it made the game more challenging, The new stealth mechanics requires more situational awareness and avoiding detection, it's not "bad", it works well for some heists but it makes luck to play a bigger part in other heists. I enjoy both Stealth and the Full assault gameplay but I enjoyed the "old stealth" because it was more simple and less time consuming, waiting and luck played lesser parts.\n\nSince my initial review there was a good amount of new heists added, some in free updates, most in paid updates (DLC). Despite heist DLCs most DLC packs are for weapons, masks, materials and characters. Missing some optional content isn't game breaking, but the DLC are too many and there are small things that could certainly be already in the game like a sniper rifle, light machine gun, grenades, more good weapon mods: all this was included behind a paywall (DLC), which is not nice. Also some DLC make the game somewhat easier, which feels that it's a bit of a "pay to make it easier" DLC.\n\nAfter so many hours playing I still enjoy playing with friends, so I still enjoy the game, although it's a bit tiresome to play the same heists over and over, so I tend to play only the Death Wish difficulty which still puts some challenge. The Infamy system is useful until Level 5 because it discounts the number of points you have to spend to unlock higher skills in the skills tree, so you can make better builds spending less points. Beyond that it's just more grinding for a few masks, materials and patterns.\n\nI don't like the random card/loot system that awards you items or masks, even useless money or little EXP boosts, I think it should be reworked. The rewards should be more balanced so everyone feels rewarded playing every single heist.\n\nPros:+ Great Co-Op fun with friends!\n+ There is some variety of heists, but it becomes tiresome after many hours playing over and over the same maps\n+ Stealth or Full assault option on most situations\n+ The developer is present and tries to update the game with good frequency\n+ The new stealth adds a new challenge and situational awareness\n+ Good range of skills. You can specialize or make good builds depending on your role in the heists\n+ Many weapons are available and can be modified, although some are DLC exclusive, but I have to say that most weapons I use are those included in the game and community updates.\n\nCons:- "New stealth" is more waiting game in certain situations than really a matter of being skilled.\n- The Infamy system is too much grinding for little reward\n- The rewards (loot system) should be rebalanced and reward the player more with more rare items\n- DLCs are too many, some things could be already in the full game or included for everybody. At this point all the DLC together cost way more more than the original game.\n- Some weapon and character perk deck DLC make the game easier in certain ways, which unbalanced compared to the original free loadout of the game.","October 15, 2015","false","679.8"," 484 of 519 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","484","519","6","2"

I don't play this game anymore, I haven't for around 3-4+ months now (From when this review was made), and I don't plan on coming back to it again, especially at the rate that it's going.\n\nCan I just point out before I state the obvious that this p*ss poor compnay, has screwed everyone over multiple times and apparently me and a very few ammount of people, are actually tired of their s*%t?\n\nThey promised things like safe house customization, a new enemy, and a few other things here and there.  Any of that happen in the past 2 years? No.  Have they STATED anything about any of those? Nope.\n\nNot to mention the APPAULING DLC that they keep putting out and saying it's "New content" when all they put out is weapons and anything that is a actual level is boring as heII.  It's basically saying "We're too lazy to make anything new so have more weapons."\n\nNow then, onto the MAIN issue that they just put out, but lets start by going over why OTHER games do this (TF2, CSGO.) and do it the right way, Overkill completely misses it.\n\nTalk about a copy paste job, it's just basically this for those of you wanting to know the jist http://i.imgur.com/6tXBcEf.gifv Oh, should I add that they litterally did the same thing with a CSGO map? Yeah, lazyness to a whole new level. Want something better that fits them to a T? This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdYRBDMJpI\n\n"The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT PAYDAY 2 WILL HAVE NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER" Please tell me you f*%sticks over at Overkill are joking with this? Talk about hypocrits.\n\n1) The way CSGO and TF2 do it = These games do it right, you are not required to buy any skins at all, they prove no stat boost, no promises on getting more kills, ammo, anything, it's purely cosmetic, you aren't even forced to get any at all, and they don't shove it in your face.  The way Overkill does it, you can only get a 'safe' from a card drop, and the only way to open that safe is if you pay money for a drill, and you're set on a RNG based kind of system.  "Oh that's just like CSGO though!" Not really, in CSGO you can get drops for FFFFFF*%KING FREEEEEEE, and they don't change anything, just make it look better, unless it's a StatTrak I suppose.  Plus any skin you get you can sell for Steam Currency to buy better skins, or save them up and trade them all in for a random skin that is one rank higher than the colors you gave the Trade.  "Oh you don't want the crate?" CSGO would say, "Well just go sell it on the market and get something that you'd like instead!" Payday = "Oh you don't want the safe? Don't have any money for the drill? Tough s*%t, bltch."\n\n2) The skins in Payday 2 ruin the stats = They've made it to where skins give weapons boosts, my question is, why? That kind of ruins the entire point of all of that stats, you may as well just get a certain gun that kills people the most out of all the guns you've ever used in the game, get a particular skin, and that's it, why bother using anything else? I think they should scrap this entirely, make the skins be drops, or better yet, why not just GET RID OF THEM, and oh, I don't know, MAKE SOME ACTUALY LEVELS?! INSTEAD OF CASH GRABBING FROM YOUR FANS?!\n\n3) *off topic kind of* All of the Moderators are now SJW = Apparently since practically THE WHOLE S%DDING COMMUNITY HATES THIS, the moderators have now flat out gotten rid of everyones posts that seemed negative in any way, instead of, oh, I don't know, TAKING IT AS F*#KING CRITICISM?! That's reaching a whole new low people, don't get rid of it, LEARN FROM IT.  I'm actually WITH the community on this, they hate it, I hate it and I don't even PLAY THE DAMN GAME ANYMORE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, and I'm with the community on this.\n\nEnding = Why people actually defend this game anymore is seriously beyond me, I haven't touched it in months, will I come back to it?  F*%k if I know, at the rate they're going probably not, especially since it gets incredibly boring after a while, I might come back here and there, but not like I used to.  It's ridden with bugs, pointless DLC padding, and now this boIIocks, stay far away, maybe if they get their head out of their a$$ and bring out more free stuff instead of this garbage then maybe you should get it, but untill then, me, and even my friends that play it, advise you to stay away from this garbage.\n\nFight for your games and how they should be made, why is this such a bad thing?  Quit letting developers run you, instead MAKE THEM do the game correctly, don't make people like Overkill turn into EA, push them back, demand MORE from them, not less, this is the reason this s*%t happens, fight against it!  Make this turn out like Deus Ex Mankind Divided, make them regret this stupid decision that they did, make them admit that they f*%ked this up.  Even though I don't enjoy the game anymore at all, I at least want the people that DO to have some respect from Overkill. Here Overkill, this is for you http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/635/465/29b.gif\n\nEdit: Their final day, and guess what they added, a jump animation.  Really? That's, it? It's not even client sided it's based off of other players, there is litterally, no difference.  That's your guys' BIG ending to this? A jumping animation? That does absolutely nothing?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gc13/recommended/218620/","gc13","GC13","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gc13/","370 products in account","Payday 2 would be a much better game if its developers respected its audience. The game makes constant demands on its players for more money in the form of DLC which brings a noticeable power creep in, despite the fact that the game had made its money back in just pre-orders.\n\nIt is a four-player co-op shooter that pits a team of four players against a swarm of AI-controlled police. If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead's model of swarms of weak enemies with a scattering of stronger enemies with special abilities, that's the model Payday 2 went with. As you level your character up though, you get new abilities, and you acquire new weapons to fight with.\n\nMask customization is probably the highlight of the game, with there being an enormous collection of masks, materials for them to be "made" out of, patterns to put on them, and colors for those patterns to be. You can make some really fun stuff, play a lot, and never see anyone wearing not just the same mask you're wearing but any mask in your collection.\n\nThat said, while anyone who finds fun in doing the same reasonable enjoyable missions over and over again will find some fun here, I cannot recommend the game.\n\nFirst off, for gameplay reasons: in Overkill, probably the most popular difficulty because lower difficulties are insultingly easy and the higher difficulty is really quite hard without good teamwork, the most common grunt enemy can only be hurt with headshots. If you're the kind of player who likes to optimize his gear, and the game gives you the tools to do that, there are only a few break points for damage against this enemy. What you'll end up doing is designing a weapon that can kill this enemy in two headshots while still being as accurate and stable in rapid-fire as possible (unless you go with a marksman rifle or a shotgun, in which case killing with a single headshot is easily attainable).\n\nThis means that despite there being dozens of weapons in each category, you can easily narrow each category down to one or two "best" guns, and the others are only there if you're comfortable with using a weapon you know is weaker than what you can be using.\n\nThen, of course, there are the business practices of Overkill. The game was profitable based on pre-orders alone, and while free content and map packs are added, so is a lot of cheap cash-in DLC that often includes pay-to-win mechanics: at first you needed DLC to have grenades, now you need DLC to have the powerful molotov cocktails, and a separate DLC for the useful ninja stars. Do you want the best gun possible? Then you need to buy the mod pack DLC.\n\nEven content that was supposed to be free and given as a reward to the fans has seen money coming in for the game: John Wick was added to the game as a playable heister, supposedly as an announced reward for getting enough members into the community group but actually because he was being used as a paid advertisement for the movie he was in. Another heist features and is named after a real life musical performer.\n\nMost recently as a "reward" for completing challenges ahead of Crimefest, Payday 2 was given a crate/key system just like in CS:GO, where as a "thanks" to the community now a portion of your post-heist loot drops will only be usable if you spend real money on a "drill" to open it, where it will then give you a random weapon skin that, just like with the DLC, makes your weapon stronger.\n\nIs there fun to be had? Sure. But there are other games out there that are just as fun, but have developers who think of their players as more than just wallets. Go play one of them instead.","October 15, 2015","false","289.5"," 352 of 375 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","352","375","6","2"

Unless something changes this game is no logner worth getting.\n\nMicro-transactions are fine in most games, FTP usually.

I boughtthe game for three of my friends, but now with this cosmetic update where I have to pay 1.50, to unlcok something I EARNED, to get a SINGLE COSMETIC which has a SLIGHT CHANCE to give me an IN GAME BENIFIT? I'm out. You're game isn't about love, or having fun anymore, its about people grinding and playing the market.

I'm gonna miss this game, but I'm not gonna take part in something so blatantly cash grabby. This is something I could have seen from EA on battlefront, but not from you guys. I'm so, so, sorry.\n\n(Also, I was so upset with microtransactions I barely noticed the balance changes done to guns.

kind of,they decided to buy the right back from the publisher and be free to do what they want with the PayDay 2 franchise,still tho as stated by Producer at overkill Here[www.twitch.tv] they said that ALL the MT's idea was an Overkill idea not a publisher one so yeah,nice commercial practices right there...\n\nNow that they said that they are gone(MT's),i still want to wait and see what times have to give us,they still have to fix a heck ton of stuff in the game,still have to fix ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs here since the game beta,discutable DLC's quality to a too high price(for the content/quality)\n\nSo as last statement i would say well done OVERKILL,for the roll back(still tho strange,first they say it's profitable then maybe as someone suggested because of the Skin unlockers they where not that profitable anymore)keep doing this,but really now focus on providing some high quality content.\n\nMy review will still remain negative until i don't see a even more step in the right direction,this is a start A GREAT START but a lot of steps have to be made still to turn this on positive again.\nEDIT:couple days later edition:Just to be more clear,i think that is NOT all forgiven AT ALL,as i said up there's still ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff to fix,feature promised since the release of the game still not released,discutable quality of the DLC's and lots of other stuff,oh and people think that the publisher was the evil guy that "force" them to develop MT's well,maybe it's true,my opinion? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or max 50% true,what is sure is that Overkill agreed with the introduction of MT's,maybe they just did a nice marketing move now who knows,people think that after several months after the Black market update aka skins and MT's introduction the selling of them was dropping quite a few and they probably want to save the more they can and set them for free,so basically there's still a lot of stuff from Overkill to really prove that they sincerilly doing this because they want to get better.\n\n["OLD" review will remain here as reminder of what happened]\n\nAs you can see from my hours on record,i'm a PayDay 2 veteran playing it since the beginning i loved this game/devs since the start lovelly idea's and a Developer different from the other one's,i saw a lot of things change,some were cool and fantastic,some less but Overkill software was always ready to listen to the player opinion and tweak the things they don't like and as always i was there enjoying the game,a Developer that actually listen to the user request/feedback is hard to find this days,that's one of the reason why Overkill WAS my favorite game Dev,some months ago they started releasing REALLY low quality and Buggy DLC at full price every month,the last one was the worst of all time(chyvarly DLC)and now at the time of this review,they introduced micro-transaction in the game,just to let you know they always said that they will NEVER introduce Micro-transaction in the game because they said they absolutly don't like that kind of things,and today they've done the exact opposite.\n\n\nEDIT:21/10/2015 In the day 6 of the crimefest they added a clearly rushed/last moment card drop called the Wolf Card that give's you a drill for free,nice move Overkill nice move,but it's not what we asked,the Micro-transaction have to leave FOREVER,they never was something to add to this game as Almir said at the game launch "We’ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)" this is someting that have to be removed,you lied to us Overkill,and that's what you got Tons of negative reviews and all this on the most big internet press around the world.\n\nEDIT:25/10/15 Worst crimefest ever,a fixfest i would call it for features that should be in the game since the beginning and bugfix as "rewards".\n\nThe next time try harder and remove the micro-transaction.\nEDIT:07/11/15 "Player seem to be loving it" almir listo I'm not so sure about that Almir(currently at 76% on Steam,3.3 on Metacritic)\n\nThe absolute disaster of the Almir AMA on reddit\n\nAlmir dodging the question LIVE on Twitch[www.twitch.tv]\n\nEDIT:13/11/15 They ♥♥♥♥ed up the game even more now glad they(not) heard our feedback,introducing even more Pay2Win microtransaction(Random crew bonus at a price of half a dlc)and the not so surprising after all this mess COP reward a 1/25 Random skin with random specs after 6+ months of waiting G♥♥♥♥ingG overkill,even the moderators here on steam and on Reddit refuses to moderate the forum's again and support this madness.","October 15, 2015","false","689.9"," 284 of 298 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","284","298","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/negative8/recommended/218620/","negative8","NegativeEight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/negative8/","468 products in account","EDIT: Overkill/Starbreeze has shifted the focus of the game towards microtransactions now, and I can no longer recommend this game at all in good conscience.\n\nThis game is generally good, and has a plethora of user-created mods available to tint and color your experience in slaughtering endless hordes of cops.  But enough of the rose colored filter and let's get down and dirty with the biggest negatives of the game.\n\n1. The community is quite terrible for both online play and the fanboys supporting the developers for their shady business practices. You'll often find yourself being kicked from games for seemingly no apparent reason other than you're new and/or learning the game, or haven't tailored your character or put on the right mask for the host, who is apparently some incarnation of a god. Joining a friend usually solves this problem.\n\n2. Peer to Peer game hosting - You'll always be at the mercy of someone else if you don't host yourself, the game is liable to crashes, freezing, frequent desync issues, and random disconnects.\n\n3. The game has an infurating amount of DLC, and your performance compared to the players who do have the DLC is almost insulting. An example of this being the Gage Sniper Pack. Make no mistake, with this game you will have to PAY.\n\n4. A worrying trend with Overkill as of late is that they are pumping out a lot of content which generally has little to no effect on gameplay as a way of keeping the community temporarily satisfied, and occasionally bundling it up as DLC.  What was a boatload of hype with "The Dentist" and his final contract ended up in massive amounts of disappointment, with little more than a rushed environment and tons of video game references in "The Golden Grin Casino Heist".\n\n5. When Overkill does make content that affects gameplay, it is usually overkill (No pun intended) on how it's balanced- creating a scenario where you become the weak link in the chain if you don't use said items or skill builds.\n\n6. The nature of some of the DLC content has become Pay2Win, for instance - The Buzzer, a melee weapon from the latest Golden Grin Heist.  Using this melee weapon on any enemy character will stun them for a few moments including Special Police Units. This trivializes the danger of the units and undermines the actual teamwork needed to control the threats in harder difficulties.\n\n7. The game fosters an environment where you can tailor skill points to your play style, however you'll find yourself having to pick and take skills from every tree to manage both stealth and loud combat missions effectively.\n\n8. Stealth mechanics are acceptable in singleplayer, where a mis-step on your part can mean having to fight hordes of cops with little to no armor and silenced weapons.  However, multiply the risk of getting detected by 3 and then times that to a random number generator and you have multiplayer. The desync in this game creates a near impossible setup for players to effectively stealth together as AI detection and line of sight is managed by the host and not the client (who is usually just moments behind the host).\n\nWhat usually happens to be a fun and simple game to understand with friends becomes a mess of complexity when you throw in a toxic online community and hordes of DLC that will end up sucking both your wallet and satisfaction away.","August 13, 2015","false","345.7"," 576 of 648 people (89%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","89","576","648","15","19"

But why it's now garbage.\nThe amount of DLC'S that have been produced, 26! What the f***, it costs more then the game itself! Even when it was $50\nand the worst part is. $5 for a few masks, and some mostly terrible weapons that are just for looking cool. Sure, some are good, but still $5.00. I've had this game from the start, it was amazing despite all the bugs. But now it's basically become Clash Of Clans. I preordered this game, the least they could do is give us the seasons pass or a few free DLC'S for trusting their game. Also, $5.00 for a character. Seriously, now it's just $5.00 for a character soundtrack and skin. ALSO, the amount of hackers on this game is pathetic, seriously they need to stop it. Also, look at Payday: The Heist. It has 1 DLC.\nThis has 26. Don't even get me started on $7.00 on a map, seriously it should be free, we paid for the game we should own the whole thing. The worst part is that there is other games (like Terraria) that have released sooooo many free updates without any dlc. And we get "Old Hoxton" and "John Wick" and we get 5 dissapointing maps.\n\nDo not buy this game, i'd urge you to download Clash Of Clans instead of this.","July 16, 2015","false","369.0"," 300 of 319 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","300","319","5","0"

Unfortunately it needs to be brought forward that the developers have begun using many of the shady business tactics frowned upon in the industry. While I was ok with the microtransaction DLC, simply due to the fact it added content that was, in general, worth the cost of admission, but as of today they have launched an unfair system that needs to be spoken about and removed. There are essentially now "crates" (safes) and "keys" (drills). Drills can be obtained in game, but so far that is a rare occurance. Drills can also be purchased for $2.50. Wow. They justified this by saying it was similar to the system in Team Fortress 2. The reason (they apparently missed this) people find that acceptable is because THE GAME IS FREE TO PLAY. People paid for Payday 2. They pay for DLC. They pay for nearly every update now. This was supposed to be an update to celebrate the players, and instead they publicly stood against the playerbase. Do not support these developers until they regain their senses on what is and is not acceptable to do to the playerbase.","October 15, 2015","false","163.2"," 279 of 294 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","279","294","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nvlddmkm/recommended/218620/","Nvlddmkm","Nvlddmkm.sys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nvlddmkm/","160 products in account","I've been playing this game since its beta, back then, the game used to have a lot of potential, It was a game I was excited for back in 2013.\nWhen Payday 2 was finally released, it was a broken, unpolished piece of software, the base content was alarmingly low and some of features announced before its release were nowhere to be found. However, the gunplay was a blast and the addition of skilltrees, mask/weapon customization and the card drop system kept the game interesting despite its lack of levels.\nAt this date, the base game offers an acceptable amount of content for its price but still remain broken and unpolished.\n\nI would actually recommend the game if it wasn't for Overkill's behavior these past years.\n\nOf course there are the sheer amount overpriced DLCs and the microtransactions but that's only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBack in 2014, Overkill hosted the first community event known as the Crimefest, where the community could be awarded free stuff by joining the community group.\nReaching 3 millions members would unlock a the last reward which was a secret at the time. Unsurprisingly, the community thought that this last secret reward was going to be something awesome, so they started to gather everyone they could in order to reach that 3 Millions member mark.\nAnd then Overkill ruined everything when they revealed that the secret reward was the fact that they were going to use those 3 Millions of people to advertise a movie and later on the AlienWare Alpha and their own VR Googles and if you leave the group to avoid that kind of advertisement, you can kiss all the the free content released after the event goodbye.\nNot to mention some of the rewards unlocked were post-poned and released roughly one year later during the second Crimefest.\n\nA couple of month after that event, Overkill released 2 DLCs on the same day which started the trend of putting 2 DLCs on the storefront instead of regrouping all the extra content they made for Payday 2 into one single DLC in an attempt to squeeze as much money as they can from their playerbase.\n\n\nThen we got the second community event : The Hypetrain which is a Crimefest where the "free" rewards are unlocked with a set amount of hypefuel that can only be obtained by buying DLCs on the store. Two DLCs were introduced : The Overkill Pack and the Completely Overkill pack which were not related in any way as their name would suggest (The first being a simple weapon pack and the later being a 25$ "support" with 4 masks and a weapon skin "crafted with love and care [...] A true Payday collectible").\nI suppose Overkill thought it would be hilarious to confuse everyone.\n\nBut this wasn't enough for Overkill, all the money they were already making wasn't even close to enough.\nFast foward to the Road to Crimefest ; the third community event, Overkill came up with the neat idea of giving the community actual in-game challenges that would unlock the rewards upon completion. Once again, the community worked hard to overcome all the challenges and managed to unlock the final reward.\nAnd then Overkill once again ruined everything when they revealed that the final reward was in fact a microtransactions system à la CS:GO.\n"But it is not that bad because CS:GO and TF2 does the same thing and get away with it... Right?"\nWell, not really, TF2 is a Free-to-play where that kind of business model is expected while CS:GO may be a pay-to-play game but is updated on a regular basis and all the content added to the game beside weapon skins is free of charge.\n\nMeanwhile Payday 2 is not free-to-play, has those kind of microtransactions, is updated on a regular basis but the content added to the game may be paid DLCs. The microtransactions are there just to, again, squeeze as much money from the playerbase rather than support the developement of the game itself.\n\nI cannot think about this game without having a bitter taste in my mouth, Payday 2 could have been something much greater than a money extracting billboard meme-shooter if it wasn't for Overkill greed.\n\nThe game is still great but Overkill is ruining it. Since all the money they are already making through microtransactions and DLC sales will never be enough, they will probably come up with something even more disgusting than the introduction of microtransactions in the future.","January 12","false","056.2"," 437 of 486 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","437","486","10","19"

Overkill have shown great innovation in how to mess up a great game. I've played the game for nearly 1,000 hours, so I'm not someone just blindly hating, nor do I take any pleasure in giving, what used to be, my favourite game a negative review.\n-They fill it with advertisements, essentially turning it into a massive billboard and showing they have no care for the game itself, just the money it generates.\nA John Wick playable character\nTwo Hotline Miami cross-promotions\nA illogical heist based around a no name DJ with his face plastered throughout it and you are forced to listen to his music. The worst part? This advertisement costs $7USD\nAn Alienware promotion that was 2 masks and 1 melee which was built up for 3 days and the masks are only for people that own an Alienware Alpha, a $500 console\nA Speedrunners crosspromotion requiring you to own Speedrunners which took up a day during an event which was supposed to be full of free content\nA mask to advertise a VR which Starbreeze had invested money into\nA 30 day countdown which ended on Payday 2's 1 year anniversary, which was filled with references to characters and locations in the game's universe, to advertise a new game they would be developing\nA melee weapon from The Walking Dead-They promise a lot of content, some which was paid for, some which was earned through community accomplishments and some which was supposed to be free, yet they don't release any of it and constantly delay it whilst they release a large amount of DLC in between.\nSafehouse customisation was supposed to be a feature since the start of the game and was used as part of the game's advertisement, has still not been released almost 2 years later and shows no sign of it being released, they recently claimed they don't even know what it will be\nAn event which required the community to reach certain amount of members before October 2014 in order to unlock content has had much of it's content delayed including; FBI files, which have been delayed until at least 2016 and they have claimed to not know what it will be and a new enemy type, which is in the same situation as FBI files.\nThe Completely Overkill pack was a $20 pack which was available for only a month and limited to 50,000 copies. It contained 4 masks, a secret item to be released at a later date and was supposed to be for Overkill's biggest supporters and they claimed it was not supposed to be a donation at all, they even passive-aggressively commented upon those who didn't buy it. After the pack was no longer refundable, they then announced that the secret item would actually be 25, but purchasers would only be able to obtain 1 out of those 25 items. It's now 4 months later and Overkill have insisted on keeping their biggest supporters in the dark, the only information they have given about these 25 items is that it is a part of a larger project and has no ETA at all\nThe infamy update, which was released in January 2014, was released unfinished. They delayed the remainder of it for over a year, despite it being the most requested update by the community, while releasing SIXTEEN paid DLCs in between. The reason for it being delayed for so long is because they wanted to make it as awesome as possible, but evidently that was not what happened. The update consisted of 8 masks and that's all.\nThe Golden Grin Casino heist was promised to be released by the end of 2014, but they delayed it. It's now being released nearly 7 months later after being palmed off to another company, though at least since they sent it off to another company, it will have less of a chance of being a bad heist. Since the Casino was announced, they have released a large amount of other updates.\nThere were supposed to be balancing for the new Swat Van Enemy, this was promised 3 months ago and there has been absolutely no indication of there being any changes.Check the comments to this review for more.","June 15, 2015","false","945.2"," 785 of 909 people (86%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","86","785","909","14","42"

Now Overkill (Our generous and totally not greedy developer *sarcasm*) decided to add microtransactions , a la CSGO.\nThe game has been going downhill for a long time now and this seems to be the end. It started with a John Wick crossover , then it went on to having to pay for free content (Yes , you've heard that right. People had to buy DLCs to unlock content.) We got the swat van turret , an enemy that is still an annoying as all hell bullet sponge. We also got a couple of stupid crossovers. Speedrunners masks that defy gravity , A chivalry crossover (Yes , robbing banks with crossbows and swords) and an Allesso crossover. So the game basically became a billboard. Then we also got ANOTHER BULLET SPONGE ENEMY , "Captain Winters" with a guard of shields in schiltron formation around him , you barely have any chance of getting rid of him without DLC weapons and if you don't get rid of him , you can't trade hostages to get your team-mates back into action and the cops will never give you a break. And now as the cherry on this pile of ♥♥♥♥ , we got CSGO weapon skins , as mentioned at the start of the review. This really breaks my heart , to see such a wonderful game that I loved and for a long time saw as my favourite has come to this.\nEdit : Now we also got a Goat Simulator DLC. Good job on making PD2 look more and more like a ♥♥♥♥♥ that any company can use to advertise their stupid game.","October 15, 2015","false","758.7"," 269 of 287 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","269","287","7","2"

I was an alpha player and a PAYDAY veteren ever since tier bonuses as well.\n\nEver since you brought HP regeneration into play, the game has gotten incredibly easier. Not to even mention the weapon balance that is completely unbalanced.

You three messed up BIG time.\n\nEDIT : (4/27/2016) The game itself costs 20.00$ (used to be 30.00$) and there is 30+ DLC's that are 5.00$ or 7.00$ that you can buy. That's literally about 100$ more for the DLC's rather than the game itself. Completely OVERKILL indeed.\n\nEDIT : (6/2/2016) Update 100 released future safes to be free and microtransactions are not really much of a problem, new skills have been released to offer the game a "different" way to play the game.

Its pretty obvious, overkill only care about money. Sure, the DLC was stupid, but I was fine with that... maybe I just ignored it because it was a good game. But what they've done the past few days is completly inescusable. If you want to know how ♥♥♥♥ed up of a company overkill are, just check out the AMA they did https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3q53ms/crimefest_is_over_ama_discussion_with_almir_on/,\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n22/10/15. I've playeda couple of games and haven't gotten a drill. IF what i've heard is true, the drop rate is timed, meaning you have to play a set amount of time before it drops (meaning people who play in short bursts might be doomed.) Overkill haven't changed a thing. I've gone back to playing the game, but I have no intention of giving Overkill money for the microtransactions!\nI will also add that alot of the crimefest content outside the drills have been bug filled messes, or feel really half ♥♥♥♥♥.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20/10/15. Overkill just released a patch which addresses the issue by allowing players to unlock the 'drills' in game without paying real money. It still feels like a ♥♥♥♥ move for them to have added the microtransactiosn in the first place, so for the mean time i will be keeping the negative rating.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLong story short, I love this game, but a recent update not only resulted in the devs lieing about free content, but also the adition of pay to win content. Im not recommending this game simply to try to show that it was a stupid idea to add pay to win! If they change the pay to win content, then this review will change. I didn't want to do this... but Overkill have dropped the F Bomb!\nThis game is great! I love the gameplay, the charactors, and its great playing with other people... but...\nRecently, an event was held in which players completed objectives in order to optain rewards (stuff like, kill 10k police officers.) After a ton of hard work, we finally unlocked everything. We were promised  Free  rewards... but this was a lie...\n\nToday, the 15th of october, Overkill decided release the first reward in the form of Pay to Win weapon skins to the game, that improve weapon stats when equiped. Not only do I despise pay to win, I also hate that overkill decided to release this as a reward which was supposed to be free.\nFor the time being, I will say leave this game and come back in a few months to see if the devs have a change of heart. I understand a dev wanting to grab extra money, but not only is overkill allready swimming in cash from all the DLC, but they have decided to add the worst of gaming sins to try to rake more money.\n\nI still enjoy this game... but this was a massivly ♥♥♥♥ move!","October 15, 2015","false","527.8"," 213 of 223 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","213","223","5","4"

With two more years of DLC cash grab coming up I no longer have faith in this game. Yes, DLC is optional but the game without DLC is rather limited and not worth it's money. The insane amount of DLC also creates a large disparity between players where you have people who have to play with a pistol and a rifle and those who run around with rockets launchers and miniguns. You get kicked from games because you don't have the right DLC related mask or weapon and hosting your own missions is out of the question unless you're willing to spend huge amounts of money on buying the required DLC.

Not to mention the issues it will get you into. Things like getting tazed by Tazers which you can't even see on your screen or cloakers running and pouncing through walls / being stuck in the same spot for a while instead of actually moving and chasing the player actively when they are meant to.\n\nAnother example would be the Hotline Miami heist which causes framedrops for quite a few players. Almir briefly mentioned that they were going to look into it but nothing ever happened.\n\nGuess what? Same thing with the Infamy 2.0 update which was promised to be more than just cosmetics. It contains nothing but masks and EXP boosts which makes it look like it was rushed after the community complained a lot about the non existent release of Infamy 2.0 on the forums. Almir said they were going to look into it "once the dust settled" and we haven't heard anything about it ever since.\n\nThe release of DLCs just kept getting worse. We're getting new bugs with every DLC which are partially claimed to be features instead of fixing them like the Molotovs which used to take down the armor of Swat Turrets instantly if you were the host of the game and only then. It has been (ab)used for cross promotion (e.g. John Wick, Hotline Miami, Speedrunners, Humble Bundle, Chivalry Medieval Warfare etc.), becoming more expensive and frequent while having less content which also got worse in terms of quality and balancing with each DLC .\nThe optimization of the latest DLC map releases have been an issue as well causing many players to have stutters and framedrops even with relatively high end rigs like mine.\nWe also had a DLC called "The completely Overkill pack" which was a time limited offer and thought of as a donation: it included 4 masks as well as a secret ingame item which has yet to be released.\nThe Game of the Year edition contains 16 of 27 paid DLCs for Payday 2 right now. Do not get fooled by the fact that they added free DLC releases to the cart.\n\nThey used the Payday 2 forums to tease us for 35 days straight with content which does not even belong to the game itself, as it was revealed afterwards. All of the content is tied to another game which was not going to be released for at least another 2 years (Overkills The Walking Dead).\n\nThere was a Hype Train event which basically forced us to buy DLCs for fuel to complete all of the goals which turned out to be just another cross promotion. One of the goals was a tournament which was supposed to have a price of $250000. It is still unknown what the tournament is or was, who participated and who actually won these $250000.\n\nSafehouse customization -a feature which has been promised to be included for the release of the game- still hasn't made it into the game 2 years after the release of Payday 2.\n\nFor the first Crimefest we were promised a new enemy and FBI Files which took them an entire year to develope. They were released shortly before the second Crimefest was announced. The new enemy is underwhelming even though he comes with interesting and unique mechanics. The FBI Files are basically the same thing that PD2Stats used to be; the website of PD2Stats was shut down thanks to that. I'd like you to take a look at the PD2Stats[www.pd2stats.com] site to read the story about all of this yourself now.\n\nThe latest addition of Overkill Software at day 1 of the second Crimefest -which is celebrating the fourth birthday of the Payday franchise- are microtransactions. Almir himself as well as David Goldfarb said that there would NEVER be any microtransactions in Payday 2 in the past.\nProof:\nProof #1\nProof #2\nProof #3[www.gamespot.com]\nThe community has been working hard for 16 days to finish challenges and unlock content which was promised to be free for everyone during the Crimefest itself.\nThey basically added the exact same system that can be found in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive from the colour of the quality of the weapons to the weapon inspection animation itself. Some of these skins will even change the stats of the weapons. Apparently they are coming together with a pre defined set of weapon mods which can not be changed or replaced.\nThe Safe drops will replace your regular card drops which are supposed to get you weapon mods, masks, materials, colours and patterns. These Safes might even contain skins for DLC weapons you do NOT own.\nA single drill costs 2,49€ right now which is about half of the cash you would spend on most DLCs if they are not on sale (4,99€) and twice as much as they cost right now with a discount of 75% (1,24€).\nAll of this led most of the veteran players to quit playing or even delete the entire game, as well as forum Mods censoring / deleting entire threads which were written and discussed in a civilized manner just as the mods asked for.\nThey even openly admit that they're actively censoring the forums.\nProof\n\nPersonally I don't feel like a game which costs about 20€ and comes with additional DLC worth about 110€ should be using any microtransaction system at all; the DLCs are more than enough as it is. Yes i've bought almost all of the DLCs for the full price including the Completely Overkill Pack except for the last 2 or so.\n\nThey disabled the LUA hook which is required to run certain mods at day 1 of the second Crimefest too. Whether or not it's related to some mods crashing the game once it gets updated or the fact that some mods are skins / give us an ability to "create" skins like GoonMod is up to you and your conspiracy theories.\nMy very own mod_override skins for the Black and Skull Dozer are still working however.","October 16, 2015","false","858.4"," 192 of 202 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","192","202","0","9"

The game is now completely Pay2Win and none of the 'Free' fun is in it.\nAnd paid skins actually give you an advantage. yay.\nNot to mention 2 years ago they promised to never ever add microtransactions and then hoped people would forget a few years later and back stab them. shame on you overkill!\n\n-Short repetitive maps with small objectives, most maps are just drilling, getting cash and going to the escape zone.\nOnly a few maps are low with lots of objectives and loud action such as Hotline Miami, but those aren't a lot of maps.\nMost maps are just small with not many verities, most missions require you to camp at a small place and fight through waves of cops. compared to PAYDAY: The Heist where everything is open with lots of objectives and places to look through.\n\n-A 2 years old game that hasn't been optimized since the release, the players have to trust and struggle with mods in order to get a playable FPS in game.\nAnd of course the latest maps they released, received a crap ton of complains about low FPS because the maps are so huge and their game is so poorly optimized.\n\n-The textures are so rubbish that modders have to make HD mods so you could enjoy something rather than 1024 textures of your character model or NPC's dropped weapons (etc)\nSometimes i stand in a corner and see pixels on the floor trying to look like a pepsi can and other trash.\n\n-AI is literally useless in this game, all they do is follow you and help you up.\nNothing else, absolutely nothing. so Multiplayer co-op is the main focus of this game, offline isn't as enjoyable as online.\n\n-Apparently DLC releases are more important than bug fixes\nThe game has a shit ton of bugs that haven't been fixed since the release.\n\n-If you want to actually enjoy the game and advance most your weapons to be Death Wish compatible you will need to purchase a few of the DLCs, or else its nearly impossible for a beginner.\nIf you don't pay, you are simply underpowered. Thank god there's no PvP.\nAlthough its nice that paying for DLC isnt a must to play a certain map.\n(Seriously RPG, Nade launchers and Flame throwers are great)\n\n-A community based off most players farming their infamy ranks on SR or HB and considering themselves pros and kicking everyone under the level Infamy 5 from their lobbies and considering themselves as Godlike heisters.\nNo one actually cares about the heist plan, your role or the in game objectives.\nAll they care is that medic or ammo bag you bring to the heist to supply them.\n\n-Over 2 years old free promised content hasn't been released until this very day.\n\n-Most lobbies are too mainstream that its simply hard to find something different these days, like a loud Bank Heist or a Heli escape on Big Bank (you get the point).\n\n-Developers listen to the community yet they are too bitchy to invest in a Workshop or a proper freaking in game AntiCheat.\n\n-Infamy ranks are not as satisfying as you might think, they're actually easy to grind and a shit that isn't rewarding.\n\nPROS:\n+Cheap DLCs (recently also got a price drop)\n+Monthly updates (DLC fun)\n+Not a lot but enough free content from time to time to keep the Helmets Flying\n+Mod support but they won't bother investing a workshop so we stop paying for sites to save mods\n+4 and maybe more years of in game content support (2 more years of dlc and free content)\n+A somewhat "Okay" plot in the background of the PAYDAY gang and Hoxton's betrayal.\n+Wide variety of weapons, masks, modifications and so on.\n+A somewhat balanced skills and perks system yet still buggy at some points.\n\n\nI wrote a lot larger review than this but steam didn't let me post this because i wrote too much.\nAnyways, i will clearly keep playing this game. i don't dislike it but i experienced and saw way too much in game to know that this game isn't something a new player would enjoy.\nI would personally uninstall and ask for a refund if i tried to join lobbies 10 times in a row and some infamy trashy decides to kick me instead of giving me tips or helping me out.\n\nAlso, this is not a DLC complain post, i own them all and will probably own future ones as well.\nNo flame no hate, i love Almir and the other developers but you can't force the whole community to behave and stop being as cocky as Hoxton is to Houston.\n\nedit: Yes, know my English is absolute MINT.","June 21, 2015","false","676.4"," 790 of 949 people (83%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","83","790","949","40","33"

In the update celebrating the anniversary of the game the developers added game skins, so the game can become another "uncrating simulator", like TF2 (which is free, mind you) and CS:GO (Which doesn't have 28 DLC's that you have to pay for). I wouldn't mind it as much, if the skins were just cosmetic, but they aren't. That's right, SKINS give you an actual advantage, since they boost stats. Also some of the skins are just for DLC weapons, which will most likely lead to situations like this:\n\nOverkill: "Oh you just spent (a ton of money on keys, or as they call it "drills") and actually managed to unlock a cool skin for the RPG, nice. Now, would you like to use that skin? What's that, you don't have the DLC for it?! Welp, better go spent another few bucks, since the skin is useless until you do!"\n\nThe things that the developers were supposed to add during the anniversary celebration were promised to be free, instead we got this. They tried to make us feel better afterwards by adding cool things such as heists from the first game, masks (a ton of them) and... a jumping animation, which to me serves the same purpose as applying lube AFTER getting rammed from behind.\n\nI really worry about the future of this game, (or the gaming industry in general) if other companies will follow Overkill's example...","October 15, 2015","false","727.8"," 185 of 195 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","185","195","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meconate/recommended/218620/","meconate","Mitsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meconate/","282 products in account","I can't recommend this game. Despite the amount of hours I've put into it, I simply can't recommend a game that's slowly deteriorated to the point that it's more of a chore than a joy to play.\n\nWhen I first got my paws on this game, it was back when there were only a couple of DLC packs, where 'infamy' wasn't a thing to prove your worth, and where players were actually more creative and dared to try new ways of completing heists rather than just repeating the structured meta that they believe they must abide by at all costs.\n\nNow Overkill promise us 2 more years of "supporting" the game, which in their language means to churn out more DLC weapon packs instead of new and inventive missions. Not that it makes the slightest of difference in the rare times that they do add extra content, as lobbies only ever consist of the same mission repeated over and over that gains them high exp (case/s in point; Hoxton Breakout and Shadow Raid).\n\nSo I start with my first major issue; the community is mostly full of pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. With a minor amount of exceptions, high infamy players think they're the ♥♥♥♥. If they're not trying to order around the lower/none infamy players, they're kicking them from matches instantly, practically defeating the whole objective of helping them to learn how to play.\nBare in mind, 'infamy' means nothing in this game, at least not how it used to (when infamy only hit 5). It doesn't prove how much experience you have at the game, it doesn't make you any stronger or makes you any wiser. It's just simply for those who are bored of sticking to level 100, and want to repeat it all over again to collect infamous masks and recieve exp faster. What's more ironic is that most of these high and mighty players have only gained their ranks through repeating the same mission over and over until they're given exp penalties and/or their brains turn to mush, which would explain a lot about their attitude. Either way, they have no room to mock others for learning missions when they're only accustomed to one or two missions themselves.\n\nAnd I wouldn't make an issue out of this and call it a con to the game if it didn't happen as often as it does, but you will experience this... a lot. If you're new, just try to stick to players around your level if you want to avoid being patronised.\n\nSo unless you've got a handful of friends to play this with, most of your playtime here will be spent browsing for servers via 'Crime.net' trying to find something other than the tedious Hoxton Breakout mission, only to join a server and either get kicked for some bizarre reason or lose connection to the host.\n\nFurthermore, the game just seems to have lost of lot of its initial sense of cooperating as a team. If only for helping to take down enemies in the waves of loud missions, nobody really needs to work together with players anymore. Nobody is really assigned to a specific role, nobody really cares what your priorities ingame are, just so long as you bring them some extra ammo and health kits. It can literally be a one man job if the player has a good idea on what he's doing, especially when it comes to completing missions in stealth, which are usually better off alone due to desync issues and ridiculous random glitches that often occur.\n\nIn the times that you do actually get into a full party match with random players, nobody ever wants to think outside of the box. Everybody has a strict and structured way of playing each and every map, despite the fact that the game implements a 'random number generator' system to change your experience each time you play a heist.\nHeck, if you dare to open the door to stairs in Hoxton Breakout, prepare to be called a noob for not using it on a shutter door or the damn armory. Or if you want to just play 'Bank Heist' in loud for once, the public won't be happy and normally quit immediately.\nThis is down to the community and the game itself. Heists aren't as free and open as they'd fool you into believing. Sure, you can choose to play most missions loud or stealth, but once you make the decision between the two, then you stick to the same objectives. Nothing ever truly random happens, such as random last minute objectives or a change in plan. The closest thing you get to that is the pre-planning stage before a heist, in which you choose your escape plan and place a few packs of ammo to make your life easier. If you're lucky, your pickup helicopter might land on the other side of the map. Whoopie. They even allow you to draw in the pre-planning stage, which is just completely pointless, as nobody ever really plans their heists out. Most stealth heists just end up in a game of trial and error.\n\nSo the remaining issues I have with the game.\n- It's been out long enough, yet the devs just haven't really given players enough options to optimise their game to their liking. Not a major issue, but still a pain that players have to use user made mods if they want to improve their performance.\n\n- None of the missions are long enough, and/or are just repetitive and tedious. Most loud missions are just placing a drill and surviving waves of enemies until the drill is complete, and then throwing bags of money around. Stealth missions are pretty much the same, minus waiting around for drill but instead having to avoid the line of sight of guards that somehow have the ability to walk through walls when the game decides to have a glitchy moment.\n\n- The card drop feature in order to gain masks and weapon attachments is just another reason the game is more of a chore. It's also the perfect excuse for Overkill to sell you their 'mod pack' DLC or other weapon DLC to speed up the process of finding those much needed attachments for your weapon/s.\n\n- You're literally paying for achievements with some of the DLC. Yes, despite the fact that you've paid £3.99 for a pack, you will be unable to use all of its content until you've completed the required achievements.\n\n- Unless you're buying DLC, most of the free weapons are underpowered in comparison, further forcing you to buy the DLC if you want the most from this game and to be on par with the other DLC paying players. Hell, anything that Overkill do give you for free is still underpowered or weak in content compared to the DLC.\n\n- It would seem DLC is a priority over fixing game issues and errors. I mean sure they eventually get around to fixing those issues, along with the release of another DLC pack.\n\nSo in conclusion, I guess you might consider it unfair to judge a game mainly by its community. But it's thanks to the game itself that the community is set out how it is. The game relies on a good community, but fails to support it. The game is currently in a state leaving the players with nothing more to do than grind for exp or test out new DLC weapon packs. And it's the repetitive and tedious missions that leave you with these only options. And I mean 'repetitive'. There's literally 4 missions of the same 'Bank Heist' which is just the same mission with different items to throw in bags, yet these are considered "unique" from each other.\n\nIn the beginning, the game really felt like something new and different. New ideas promised, (which have since been "put on hold") and the players actually seemed to play for the fun rather than the rank beside their username. Now it just feels like the developers don't know where else to take the game. They won't give us a Steam workshop, yet will release new weapon packs often. They leave it to modders to create unstable LUA mod to help improve their game experience and fix issues the devs are fully aware of, rather than fix these issues themselves.\n\nSo up to this point, until they decide to actually improve the game, quit with the DLC priority and help the players have a better experience, I simply can't recommend it.\n\nSo here's to 2 more years of nothing but weapon pack DLC, and a whole lotta unfixed bugs.","April 30, 2015","false","620.2"," 1,592 of 1,998 people (80%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","80","592","1","65","106"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overvulture/recommended/218620/","overvulture","Menacing Tentacles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overvulture/","583 products in account","Is it weird to not recommend a game I've put hundreds of hours into? Obviously I was enjoying something about it. And I was! Despite a lot of nonsense surrounding game design, updates, dlc, and weird developer behaviour, this for a long time was one of my favourite "mindless grind" kinds of games that was always good to kill time with. Given the massive amounts of fake longevity and emphasis on grinding and grinding and grinding, there was always something to work towards. It's a stupid game that takes itself way too seriously, sure, but it's always been a lot of shooty fun.\n\nBut it's dead. Dead dead dead dead dead. And no amount of shouting at it will get it back up.\n\nIt's not dead because of a lack of community. Not at all, there are still plenty of players to be found. It's not dead for a lack of updates. There just was a major update and the developers are still supporting the game over two years later. It's dead because a gradually declining quality of updates has actually made the game progressively worse and less playable than it was during its beta release, and the most recent update finally nails the coffin shut.\n\nSo here's the deal. The game has some cool stuff going for it. Lots of guns, great soundtrack, really satisfying shooting and an awesome heist movie aesthetic that really tickles my jimmies. The first few games with friends or with strangers are going to feel really cool and immersive. But the cracks really start to show fast and repetition sets before long. Make no mistake: this is a game about grinding, and is designed to encourage it in every way.\n\nThe scale of time versus reward when playing on a moderate difficulty or just playing less rewarding heists is stupidly low, so it quickly becomes a game of identifying the best levels to grind and playing nothing but those. Equipment variety is tossed out the window if it doesn't help you complete those specific heists faster, and the community expects you to be on board with this. Sure you're not required to grind, but you'll find that not only are fewer people willing to play with you, it takes an agonizingly long time to acquire what you want.\n\nAnd this is of course because the drop system is ridiculous and designed to make the game last way longer than it should. Weapon mods are awarded randomly and might not be for the weapon you want. Plus they require cash to attach... and then more cash to attach again if you swap them out for another. Mask customization materials are one-use only and also random.  Everything is stretched out and limited that it almost feels like playing a free-to-play game that's nudging you towards microtransactions. More on those later.\n\nBut none of this is a deal-breaker for me yet. I don't mind a bit of mindless grinding. It's always been a game I play on the side of whatever else I'm actually playing, something where I don't have to think much and can just pull the trigger a lot. And it does get to be a lot of fun with friends for a while, especially when you're coordinating and pulling things off smoothly, especially the stealth approach, even if the stealth system is silly as hell.\n\nDLC isn't a deal-breaker for me either. There is some really dumb and overpriced add-on content for sale with this game, and overall it's spread out over way too many different packs, each containing very little, but I've bought most of it anyway to support a game I was enjoying. The DLC situation has got worse and worse over time too, becoming less interesting with each release and coming more frequently. The heists are always fun and impressive, though there isn't a lot of game time with each one, and the weapon packs vary from useful and almost required for high-level play to utterly useless for anything but novelty.\n\nI've shrugged off a lot of crap over the years with this game, still playing it and defending it despite how dumb it acts sometimes. The buggy and unpolished nature, the emphasis on constant grind, the excessive dlc, and of course just how braindead it actually is despite disguising itself as a sophisticated heist simulator. Weapon packs were fine. Character packs were fine. I've been consistently disappointed in the lack of actual upgrades and tweaking for the main game in favour of paid content, but tweaks don't pay the bills, I get it. It's not helped when the developers act obnoxiously "cool" and quote memes while they sell their new DLC and act like everything they do to the game is a huge favour, but I don't have to like the developers to like their game. At least they hadn't fallen victim to any F2P temptation yet.\n\nBut. It's time. They finally did it. Rather than try to maintain the illusion that they were a cool, rebellious little studio that would never give in to mainstream pressures, microtransactions have arrived. Not only that, but they're not simply for aesthetic rewards either, but actually have gameplay effects. I don't care if they change their mind about this tomorrow, if they apologize and admit it was a terrible idea they'll never do again. Just announcing this has already broken the already very thin goodwill I had left for this company and I am very unlikely to support any of their future projects ever again. They've strung me along nicely so far and wrung money out of me as I continued to come back to their strangely addictive gunwank, but I'm done.\n\nIn short, this game was pretty fun for quite a while, but has gradually declined in quality over time. In its current state, there could not possibly be a worse time than now to get into this game if you haven't already. You missed the train and it's not coming back. Just keep moving. Nothing to see here.","October 15, 2015","false","471.9"," 164 of 175 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","164","175","4","0"

Several representatives of Overkill claimed that Payday 2 would not include micro-transactions. One such represenative said that it would "never" happen. And yet, they implemented micro-transactions as part of the "free" Crimefest II update. Moral of story: Never buy Overkill products and never trust their word for it is worthless.\n\nFurthermore, independent sources claim that Overkill have taken an axe to the modding community in the same update, even mods "approved" by Overkill such as HoxHud, by supposedly removing the LUA Hook required to make mods work. If true, such is certainly not the way to thank a community for their dedication to improving a game over a prolonged period of time.\n\nFinally, that Overkill would have the effrontery to do both of the above things as a "reward" for completing community challenges in the Road To Crime Fest Event shows complete and utter contempt for the Payday 2 community. Keeping in mind that the Road to Crime Fest Event is all about celebrating the anniversary of Payday: The Heist - which is ironically micro-transaction free. Clearly Overkill have grown fat on the profits of their hit DLC train known as Payday 2, I say that because every employee at Overkill must be on acid for them to collectively conclude that this was the right way and right time to implement something that they'd previously stated they'd never do.\n\nYes, micro-transactions and the removal of modding capability is exactly what this game needed - Clearly...\n\nSources:\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=34451580&postcount=1\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/","October 15, 2015","false","230.0"," 149 of 156 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","149","156","2","1"

All I want to say is that they should’ve stopped releasing content in 2015 instead of extending it for another 2 years, because lets just face it – people are going to get bored with endless & overpriced dlcs, and not only that but if they start working on Payday 3 after the 2 years and release it in 2018-2020, the whole Payday community would be dead. This makes me feel like Overkill doesn’t care about the community and only cares about money. Also, not to mention that this game has become a pay to win game, with micro-transactions in place. At this point, I can’t tell if they’re: a) greedy as f--- or b) seriously in need of money. I’m sure you’ve all read this in the reviews, but the worst part of this whole thing was that Almir told us Payday 2 was never going to have micro-transactions, yet they implemented in. And I get it, people can change their minds and such but be careful with what you say, just for your own sake.\n\nEDIT: apparently stat boots appear at the end of the game now, so you wouldn't have to pay for it. but still, my point remains clear.","April 14","false","990.6"," 295 of 344 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","295","344","11","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtifactLancea/recommended/218620/","ArtifactLancea","Aromaseraphy - Angelica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtifactLancea/","86 products in account","I tried, Overkill, I really did. You didn't fix known bugs because you were too busy adding new DLC, and new enemies that were unfair WITHOUT DLC, and I tried to ignore it. I loved this game, I really did, and I played it to virtually no end, even at one point abandoning Team Fortress 2 for it. "Weapon packs" that contribute nothing just kept pouring in and in and in, with nothing useful to add, just one gimmick weapon to grab people's attention in the hopes that they'd buy the "Wacky" item, and I tried to ignore it. I got over the fact you never bothered programming Cloakers properly, and that they're happy to kick you from the ground floor on Rats whilst you're on the roof if they can't think of a way to path to you. Desync was never so much as acknowledged after an initial "Patch" that vaguely improved it whilst drop-in joining, even though a community mod (PocoHUD) addresses the issue perfectly well, and I got over it. Refusal to add limb hitboxes because they'd be "Too much unnecessary work" when one man took one afternoon off and implemented them himself was pushing it, but I STILL got over it. Your treatment of loyal fans on Twitter, e.g. the fan who called you out for not caring about the console version and got the response of "IF I LOVED A GAME ID BUY IT ON PC" (As though anyone would care enough to buy this mess after that sort of treatment) I resented, but I played on regardless. The Hype Train, a pay-to-enter version of a previous free event, that provided us with an advertisement for a future pay-for DLC and an enemy that's virtually immortal without DLC, that makes it near impossible for armour players to play the game their way I tried and tried to ignore, but the fact that people paid millions collectively to see an ad got under my skin. When you failed to deliver on an enemy you presented TWO YEARS AGO and didn't start development for until the beginning of 2015, and instead just made it a hyper-powerful version of an already existing enemy (That of course is weak as a kitten if you use DLC-only explosives), that deploys with what is essentially a small troop of copies of itself I was disgusted. The FBI files, a long-awaited addition to the game, turned out to be a link to Overkill's own website that plays a cute little "Virtual machine" that shows you gun statistics, something there's already a Wiki for, as well as the character's profiles and backgrounds, something you could already see on crimenet in game. And I took a break, and figured I'd get over it eventually. I'd come back, I'd play again. I played this game to the point where I could beat Death Wish solo on loud heists, so surely I'd pull through thick and thin and return to the game with open arms. Right?\nAnd then Overkill lost it.\nThe game now has CS:GO's uncrating system. They clearly noticed Gun Mettle was a huge success in Team Fortress 2 and decided their community would love the same thing. Small problem with this theory, however: Team Fortress 2 already had an item system, and hundreds upon thousands of cosmetics that could customise your characters to however you wanted them to be. Payday had nothing of this sort, so this comes across as a blatant cash-in on an idea that worked for another game. But that's fine. Even if they stole the idea right down to the dot on the I (Or the inspect animations in this instance), it worked for CS:GO, it wasn't as bad as anyone with over 15 hours thought it was going to be in TF2, maybe it'll work for Overkill, despite their weapons being awarded via a level system and changing appearances based on what attachments and customisations you apply to the weapons. And if that were it, I'd say "I really hate this company but whatever" and resign myself to just playing.\nBut no, that's not all. The weapon skins give statistical advantages. These give upgrades in stats compared to the base skins. And there's NO other way to get them, save for opening them with a keydrill, straight from the community marketplace. You HAVE to spend money, REAL money, not the two billion you have sitting in your offshore account with no purpose since they lied about safehouse customisation, but actual currency on your Steam account, to get these weapons, and by not shelling out extra money that already costs (Or so I've been informed, not a US resident) around 25$, you are at a disadvantage to other players who WILL do so, because Overkill wanted to profit that much more off an update TF2 did for free, which was successful because of the rebalancings. Congrats, Overkill. I know I'm not the only person you'll have heard this from, but you're true filth, and I took great pleasure in uninstalling. DON'T buy this game. All you'll do is have your arm twisted until you relent and buy an ever-expanding list of DLC, and now apparently some pretty gun skins, or else the game is insultingly difficult (On Death Wish, all other difficulties are easy regardless, because why would "Overkill", the fourth difficulty setting with only one above it, pose a challenge, and stealth is always easy just for what it is). The game is disgusting, and never content with the amount of cash it's sucked in, and broken beyond repair. But don't expect it to be fixed. That'll cost you extra.","October 15, 2015","false","706.1"," 140 of 147 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","140","147","2","3"

( Here is an idea for OVK Next you should realease a cross-over with shower with your dad simulator ;) I'm sur people at OVK will think it's a good idea).\n\nFor me it is too much, I never thinked of Payday 2 as a realistic game, but there is a differencce between unrealistic and completely dumb ! If you want to release more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cross-over in the future at least dont ask 7.79 $ for it !!!\n\nI wont pay for that DLC, and I uninstalled Payday 2, and wont re-install it unless OVK change their way!\n\nPayday 2 is a great game but, greedy developement have destroyed it ! Overkill is laughing at it's player base trying to milk all the money they can from it ! IF you dont have time to patch bugs, how can you have time to realease that BS ???\n\n2 of the special enemy in the game are broken ! Tazer can taze you without line of sight ! Cloaker can cloak tought wall ! But, no time to fix special enemy !\n\nThe so called Re-balance, Overkill tried to balance weapon during crimefest, now we have handgun hitting harder than shotgun and assault rifle! Its been more than 2 months and nothing has been made about this!\n\nThe perk deck are currently un-balanced, some are not even usable on Deathwish! Overkill said they were balancing the game around the base content ! Armorer is one of the base perk deck and it's worthless! Infiltrator and Grinder are great for DW but guess what, they both come with DLC !\n\nAfter one year working on a new enemy! They released Captain winters ! The captain arrive on the map, stop moving, and lock the wave!( you have to defeat him for the police assault to stop) He is surrounded by other shield! And guess what ? The best way to defeat him is Molotov Cocktail(BBQ pack DLC). But they are balancing the game around base content....\n\nOverkill said that after crimefest they would be more transparent...But ..... They said they would listen to the community too! Oh yeah Almir now create thread in the forum ! Then drop a couple of ;) in the comment, that's listeneing to the community !!\n\nI used to buy every DLC at he moment they were relased, I would have buyed any full priced game from overkill, Would have pre-ordered it! But with the way they are taking now I wont buy anything from them at full price !!\n\nGG overkill !!! You can now rename your game for: PAY-2-WIN-DAY !\n\nPosted: 15 Oct, 2015 @ 7:38pm\nUpdated: 21 Oct, 2015 @ 1:04pm\n\nOverkill are still liar they lied about MC and a lot of other thiings! They took the first step in the right direction at day 6 of crimefest by making drill dropable by card drop!\n\nThis is not enough yet ! Now safe and drill can be dropped in-game, but we have no idea of the drop rate of the drill. Overkill still have a lot to do, and to learn!\n\nI dont think they will continue in the right direction...","October 15, 2015","false","681.2"," 108 of 113 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","108","113","2","0"

You have to pay 5+, doesnt matter if u want only one gun from the DLC.\n\n#UPDATE1: in the last days they added steaminventory, safe (case) and drill (key) like CS:GO has... so now we have microtransactions too... seems OVK found their own killswitch...\n\n#UPDATE2: it's possible that you pay 2.50 to open a safe with a skin for a DLC you don't own...\n\n- Bad moderation, thats a subjective experience but the moderation of the community is pretty bad. One of the mods will kick you from chat because he just dont like your opinions or the female mod is drunk and breaks rules and writes nonsense.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisbi/recommended/218620/","wisbi","Wisbi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisbi/","1109 products in account","Here we are, Day 1 of crimefest 2015, and I've been convienced by Overkill themselves to write this review. (Sorry if it sounds ranty, but it kind've is.)\n\nIt's been a while since we've gotten any REAL updates. Everything for the past months has been DLC. We rarely actually get anything for free. We finally get the FBI files? It's just a link to a website off site from the game. I've been told that this makes it BETTER but it still comes off as lazy, I don't know. Our new Gensec enemy? Captain Winters? A bunch of shields crammed into eachother. I ran into that everytime I played Hotline Miami day 2. The Chivalry pack was personally my last straw, as it introduced items FROM ANOTHER GAME... FOR MONEY. Meanwhile, Chivalry gets Payday items for free. Crazy right? But now THIS. We were promised free updates for crimefest. Emphasis on "FREE"? And what was the first thing we get? First of all, we got a weapon rebalance, which was threatened to never occur unless we did the rediculous road to crimefest challenges. But now? F**KING. CRATES. That's right, CRATES. Like TF2, and CS:GO. Overkill's greed has no bounds, their supposed 'free' update, is nothing but a gimmick laced with micro-transactions.\n\nNow, I loved Payday, as you could discern by my playtime. But this? This is just the mark of a bad company trying its most to squeeze every little cent out of its player base. They do so little to ever improve the actual game. There are game-breaking bugs still present that have been in since day 1. And insted of fixing them, they push more content, begging for money. "Well it's just a change, you'll get over it." No, not this time. This is where I draw the line. This is where I say, no more. I'm never spending another cent on this game. This single update has literally sapped all the fun I could have out of it. Good job Overkill. You've killed your franchise for one more player. Maybe when you're sinking, you can look back and atleast realize how and where you f**ked up. I may reconcider were they to withdraw the fact you have to PAY for the 'special drills' (keys) to open their 'safes' (crates).\n\nAnd guess what? They won't ever do that. Overkill never backs out of ANYthing. And no matter how much the player-base hates it, there'll be enough people who'll eat it up to keep Overkill afloat, and that's all that matters to them. Screw 80% of the community when we only need 20% to survive, right? During crimefest, they were hardpressed to actually get 30,000 people online at once. They had to make an announcement for it. The game is dying, and they're doing nothing to help it other than trying to make that last few cents before it does.\n\n>Edit<\nAnd here we had day 2... Nothing short of a JOKE. We get some crappy masks? ONLY masks? And not just that, FIVE WHOLE CHALLENGES. WERE DEDICATED. TO. MASKS?? It should tell you something that this game's reviews SWEPT red over night. It dropped a whole 10% in approval ratings within 24 hours of announcing the blackmarket, and another 4% before writing this review (It has over 140,000 reviews. That's a lot of people changing their minds.)  And WOW. Nobody's screwed up this bad in a single update since Valve and Bethesda tried to charge cash for mods, and guess what? They LEARNED from that mistake. This was a great chance for Overkill to save SOME face but instead they spit in ours. I hold my breath on what kind've disappointment Day 3 holds.\n\n>Edit edit<\nAnd here we are, Day 6. Overkill finally buckled and added in drills as card drops. Or so they say, I've yet to see a single, even MISSED card, as this fabled 'Wolf Card'. Good job setting the drop-rate lower than an infamous mask. Nothing else has been changed, and this is hardly a comprimise.\n\n>Edit edit edit<\nSo Crimefest has come and went, and while it COULD have been good. The fact it was poisoned by the blackmarket update remains. The additions of old heists is pretty cool. But really? What did we get other than that? A lot of masks nobody could care for? An update to the AI and Crime.net that SHOULD have already been in the game? ONE new gun and a really buggy new tripod mechanic, that shows little to no actual value of use on anything over normal difficulty due to specials and their incap abilities. A jump animation update that doesn't even look good? We got new masks, new achievements, and a new TRAILER, all revolving around jump animations, are you serious? What else did we get?\n\nOh yes, let me write it out. I'd hate to touch on things I already have, but it's been nearly a week since I touched this review.\n\nMicrotransactions - We already had to pay 20-30 dollars for the game. Then they ask for 100+ dollars for DLC. Now this, a mechanic literally ripped out of CS:GO. Do you know what skins are? They're a mod. You know how before, we'd get around 4 weapons, maybe 4 masks, and some assorted mods for a 5 dollar pack? Now they're asking for 2.50 for ONE weapon mod. Oh it's not the one you want? TOO BAD! Go gamble some more.\n\nBroken Promises - Former head of Overkill said there wouldn't be any. Current head of Overkill said there wouldn't be any. And what did we get? We got them anyway... Where's the safe house customization that was promised BEFORE release? Where's the COMPLETELY OVERKILL SPECIAL ITEM, for those of us who baught that pack? Who supported you when you asked for it, and then you sh*t on us? It took over a year to develop the FBI files, and what was it? A WEBSITE. ONE LITERALLY STOLLEN FROM THE PAYDAY STATS GUY. It took over a year to develop the new Gensec enemy, and it was the laziest f**king thing, literally just shields mushed together. The driving mechanics were promised to be fixed, and they're still wonky as hell. We still have major desync issues. But those can wait when you have a new 5-7 dollar DLC pack to push out right?\n\nOne p**sed off community - The game's Steam approval rating has dropped about 23% since the update was introduced, and it's only on a steady decline from here. Do I need to say more? That's around 35,000+ people of the current 160,000+ reviewers, or have either made a new review like me or changed their old ones. Overkill claims to always have open ears to the community but it's clear they don't give a crap what we think.\n\n>Edit x4<\n\nSo I got word the COP item was released. But before we get to that, I'd like to point out Overkill announcing the Charity thing just after crimefest ended. I don't know of this was just really well timed, or they're attempting to cover their as*es, with the 'it's for the Children!' routine, but from how Overkill treated us so far, I'm guessing the latter.\n\nANYway, the COP item finally came out and /WOW/. It's nothing but another. F**king. Crate. A 20 dollar crate. Really guys? Took you the better part of a year to come up with that one, did it? We get a random weapon skin from it as usual. It's completely random with no say over what it is. It's not even gurenteed a good quality. Needless to say, the community is back up in arms over this, as they should be. It's apparently gotten so bad, the forum moderators have quit since Overkill is physically incapable of learning a simple lesson. The item in the COP safe was promised to be cosmetic only, yet apparently comes with more stat boosts than any other skin thus far. (If I've read this right, forgive any misinformation as I've stopped caring about this flustercluck of a game since October.) They've claimed the sales are doing what they want, so I assume their whole goal was to get 50,000 people hating them. Oh sorry, we're the 'vocal minority' so we don't matter. (The game at any given time has about 20k people playing it at most. I'm pretty sure doubling that takes us out of the 'minority' range.)","October 15, 2015","false","926.1"," 103 of 107 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","103","107","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/218620/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","TLDR: With 505 Games gone and Overkill redeeming themselves wonderfully, it's time to put down the pitchfork and see where they take this game.  I'm hopeful for the future.--\nPayday 2 added microtransactions!\nYeah!\nOverkill said they would never do it!\nYeah!\nWe should forgive them since it was the publisher's decision, and Starbreeze/OVK pulled it out the moment they were allowed to!\nYea-- Wait, what the f...\nJust hear me out for a moment, will ya?\n\nPayday 2 is a game you all have certainly heard of before, for better or for worse.  Years ago, at launch, it was "barebones but fun with a lot of potential."  Later, it was "a friggin' masterpiece every PC gamer should own."  Later-er, it was "a good game but with questionable DLC policies."  Finally, the later-est, it was "A ♥♥♥♥ing disgrace with developers breaking promises that nobody should buy."  So, let's look at what exactly happened, shall we?\n\nYesterday, Payday 2 celebrated its 100th update.  Starbreeze completely bought out the rights to Payday from 505, a company known for being a bit dodgy at times with its business practices, under the deal that they would receive 33% of the profits from Payday 3 (which was confirmed yesterday, get hyped) but no more than $40M.\n\nSo what does this mean?  Well, it means Starbreeze and Overkill can do whatever they want with the game.\nTHEY STARTED BY REMOVING MICROTRANSACTIONS ALTOGETHER AND MAKING THE BLACK MARKET FREE FOR EVERYONE.  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-31-payday-3-confirmed-payday-2-ditches-microtransactions\nI can't stress how important this is.  NOBODY has done this in the past, EVER.  Payday is the very first example of a step back on microtransactions, and they deserve much more than forgiveness for 505's mistake; they deserve your RESPECT.\n\nFrom death threats to insults to slander, Almir was the beaten-down figurehead of a company taking the fall for a publisher's decision.  Did he take it personally?  Who knows?  If he did, I can't blame him, because we learned that fateful day in November that the Payday 'community' certainly had the potentital to be completely vile.  Yet, Almir and the rest of Overkill's 75 developers, who have supported the game for four years of free and paid content under 505, have been apologizing to US and have finally given the means to reverse their mistake.  Let me just recount some instances of microtransactions for you: Killing Floor 2 has a trading market with microtransactions.  This game hasn't even left Early Access, and is already charging for weapon skins and character items with plenty of "precious" skins for <$200 on the market.Rise of the Tomb Raider, a $60 game, has over $300 in purchaseable content.Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 introduced microtransactions and loot to the CoD series for the first time.Overwatch, while launching at a reduced price of $40, has a loot-box system that offers lootboxes of cosmetics (normally obtained by one per level up) for $2 per 2 boxes or higher.  Items are non-tradeable, permanent, and non-purchaseable gold for items can be obtained from lootboxes, so this is one of the more fair systems.Most despicably, Valve themselves have THREE virtual markets; they have what is essentially gambling (but without excluding minors) for Team Fortress 2, CS:GO, and Dota 2.  Team Fortress has no rating on the store page and no age-gate, and Dota 2 is rated T.  No action is taken to stop a minor from wasting even hundreds on "unboxing" virtual crates for $2.50 per key.\nWhile Payday 2 had this gambling system I despise, it wasn't of the developers' free will as we now know, and they have made a completely unprecedented move by pulling them.  In a way, I kind of view Overkill and Starbreeze above many other developers now.  It's really great to see something like this in the day and age where microtransactions are starting to just be tolerated.\n\nAs for whether you should buy the game or not?  Well, it's Payday 2.  If you like smashing and grabbing things, like taking down lots of zombies with guns cop uniforms, like the feeling of crap in your pants when you hear a Cloaker flying across the room, and don't mind a bit of grinding as you schedule weekly appointments to smash down a mall's windows, then yes, Payday is a great game.  Friends not included, sadly.","May 31","true","38.5"," 170 of 199 people (85%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","85","170","199","14","29"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/defiance7/recommended/218620/","defiance7","Deffy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/defiance7/","1112 products in account","I've played the game for almost 100 hours, which isn't nearly as much as some other people did, but I reached the max level (and bought "infamy"), so I feel like writing a quick review to sum up the flaws and pros of the game.\nRead summary for a tl;dr.\n\nLet's talk general gameplay first.\nStealth missions are nearly impossible to complete with random people, especially if they're new / inexperienced players. The entire game is balanced around playing with 3 other people, yet playing with randoms is usually super frustrating, which makes you want to do stealth missions alone instead. Doing them alone is not impossible, but it takes much more time and they're generally more difficult to complete on your own. Now that's a problem with most co-op games, but Payday relies on strategy a lot more than most of them, especially since a tiny mistake can ruin the entire mission, sometimes half an hour of time goes in vain, when someone screws up.\nSolution? Right, play with friends. However, if they start playing the game later than you, you're gonna have to explain a lot of stuff before you can play for real, since the learning curve of each mission is pretty steep.\nRegarding non-stealth missions - "loud" missions, higher difficulties can't be completed with any less than 4 people, since like I said, the game is balanced around playing as 4. Oh, there're bots, but sadly Payday has one of the dumbest AI there ever was, so in stealth, they just stand around doing nothing and in loud mode, they usually get stuck and die within seconds. Quite often they just chill around while you are dying on the ground, instead of helping you up.\nSo yeah, if you wanna buy the game, I recommend playing with 3 dedicated friends that are willing to spend as much time playing as you do.\nThe second issue is the endless and very unrewarding grind. Let's say you're building your talent tree and decide, that the talent you chose isn't that good. What to do? Reset the entire tree, get some (ingame) money back and build the tree from the beginning. Each talent costs money. Each weapon costs money. Masks cost money. Everything costs money and you have to grind A LOT, to unlock at least a portion of content. You buy that one weapon for a million that you always wanted, just to find out that it sucks ingame and the grind was pointless. Rinse and repeat. Now that's not a problem for me, as an MMO player, I'm used to grinding stuff, but if you go into the game expecting co-op fps, prepare for a single-player stealth mission grind-fest instead.\nThird issue is max level, endgame gameplay - there's none. At max level, you're allowed to reset using the infamy system and start all over, with no talents, retaining only your items. I'm sure you can imagine my excitement after 80 hours of grinding experience to level 100 just to start all over.\n\nThat's gameplay, it's often fun - especially with friends, it's often frustrating - especially with randoms.\nLet's talk other stuff. A couple months back, Overkill (developer) added "drills" and "safes", apparently both can drop ingame, but the chance of a drill dropping is probably around 0. Safes contain items that may have (depending on the item quality, which is random) improved statistics making the game seem pay to win to majority of the community. As shady as it is, I honestly don't think it matters, since there's no PvP. You can complete all the content without the items from safes, so it's pretty whatever.\nThe thing I hate more than the microtransactions are the DLCs. There's a ♥♥♥♥ ton of them and each one adds one - often ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission, or multiple - always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions. Plus a couple useless masks and sometimes weapons. What sucks the most is that even though the weapons are usually useless, there's always that one useful item that you really want. Example - grenades, very useful in Mallcrashers mission, etc. So you endup buying that pack for 5€ just for that one thing, making the other content of that DLC meaningless and the item overpriced.\n"Oh, Deffy, but you don't need to buy the DLC if you don't want to". Yeah, but other people will have the item, since it's super helpful and I won't have it and that sucks - everybody knows the feeling. Being forced into buying a 5€ DLC just for one item sucks.\nThat being said, most of the DLCs absolutely suck. It's obvious their sole purpose is to make quick cash, not to entertain or improve gaming experience. Same goes for the real cash items. Everything Overkill has done since the game release, is milking cash, none of the patches made the game more fun or rewarding.\n\nWhether you want to buy the game after all I've said is up to you. I'm on the verge myself, unsure if I still like the game or not. Overall my feelings are more on the negative side, yet I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game at all as the first 20-ish hours were very entertaining. It gets more and more boring as you realize all there is to do is grind more cash / experience.\n\nSummary:\nIt's fun to play with friends once in a while, but not on daily basis.\nIgnore the safes and cash items, they're worthless gimmicks.\nExpect a long grind and don't expect it to be rewarding.\nRandom people in lobbies are often dumb, what's new.\nIf you don't have friends to play with, it's quite possible that you're gonna stick with solo stealth missions, unless you can handle the frustration of playing with randoms.\nHave a second monitor and prepare something to watch while you spend half an hour lockpicking.\n\n\n\n","April 26","false","98.2"," 267 of 332 people (80%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","80","267","332","15","0"

I've loved the hell out of this game ever since I heard about it back in 2013, and I've been playing it ever since. However, this first day for Crimefest 2015 has caused me to lose a lot of respect I had for the developers. We were promised FREE DLC for all the grinding we did to unlock all of those challenges (Don't even get me started on farming jewelry store normal for those card drops... ugh). Then, when Crimefest comes around, we see the result of all our hard work which is the OPPORTUNITY TO BUY SKINS as our first major dlc update. Now... I don't know about you, but THAT'S NOT FREE CONTENT OVERKILL. NOT TO MENTION THAT THOSE SKINS ACTUALLY GIVE STAT BUFFS TO THE WEAPONS. So now if you want to optimize your weapons to their fullest potential you have to shell out more money on the steam marketplace in order to get that extra 4 stability instead of spending in game money on a weapon mod you earned while having a fun time in a heist. Yes, people have spam linked that gamespot article about the previous lead game designer David Goldfarb saying "No. No. God, I hope not" about having microtransactions in payday 2, and the spamming is justified. In fact, I'm going to do it right now http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/\n\nIf I was David and I saw what they did to my game with this crap, then I'd be completely disgusted\n\nTo start off Crimefest with the opportunity to buy weapon skins that are needed to fully optimize your weapons with buffs is the worst joke I've heard in a long time. I would've been happy with this day just being the weapon rebalancing and the new screen to alter your guns with mods.

Overkill did mention in the past that they would hopefully never add microtransactions in the past, and they went against of what they said. It is a really akward move they did, especially if I played the game for a decent amount of time.\n\nYou will need to pay actual money, just to unbox weapons with modified stats to have a small advantage over standard weapons including DLC related ones, which is worse than any other similiar system where it would include wepaon crates, minus the part where it modifies any gun mechanics/stats.\n\nNumerous of bugs and glitches still remains that Overkill hasen't bothered with yet and by the time they do so, it's probably at a time that everyone stopped waiting, let alone optimization issues. Weapon balancing issues are severe, especially when the the more decent DLCs have weapons containing stats that would make the former obsolete.\n\nHere's a link related to Overkill stating microtransactions in the past: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/","October 15, 2015","false","355.4"," 84 of 85 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","84","85","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/218620/","toquina","Overkill_Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/","302 products in account","Payday 2 goes back to one of the oldest conflicts in the entertainment industry, cops versus robbers. Four hardened criminals go on their newest crime spree across Washington DC. From drug trafficking to political framing, to the Payday gang, it's just another payday.\n\nPayday 2 is a co-op first person shooter with RPG and stealth elements. Missions have a heavy focus on a risk to reward design, often providing optional objectives within missions. Teams will frequently have to weigh their ability and the situation to get the best payout available.\n\nCombat takes a chaotic shoot em up feel as police show little intelligence, instead opting to overwhelm players by sheer numbers and firepower. Most teams will have little trouble on normal or hard difficulties, however higher difficulties will pose a challenge even to experienced players. The large range in difficulty allows the game to appeal both to casual and hardcore gamers. Weapon recoil and animations make guns feel unwieldy and hefty, creating a very powerful hit between each shot often missing in many FPS shooters.  As players level up they will gain access to skill points, allowing them to gain new abilities and passive buffs.\n\nPayday 2 also offers players the option of using stealth to complete levels without being detected at all. While this can be enjoyable for some, players who are not skilled in the stealth approach will often find themselves waiting around for the 'all clear' back at the spawn zone. Combat can keep players engaged during timed objectives; stealth leaves you just standing around twiddling your thumbs.\n\nWhile missions are short (mostly lasting 10-20 minutes average), repetition of levels quickly becomes frequent. Replaying the same mission, objectives will remain the same yet many aspects of the level design can change. Levels have many random factors which will force players to alter their approach to a mission. These random factors can range from an escape door no longer existing to the location of the primary objective. Random elements add a lot of replay value to missions as well as stopping players from acting out the same plan repeatedly.\n\nStrong dependency on working as a team can cause public games to be frustrating at times, however they still remain functional and entertaining. Playing with a group of friends is where Payday 2 shows its strengths: a team works tightly together within the chaotic action. Single player, with or without bots, is poor making its simple AI and repetition more apparent, and should be completely avoided. Downloadable content seems reasonably priced, offering new weapons and levels to play. Those who own DLC missions are able to host them, while friends and other players can join without having to own the same DLC.\n\nThe price tag comes just short of most AAA titles and the same could be said about the gameplay. Missing animations and high repetition make Payday fall just short of what we expect from top budget titles. Although Payday 2 plays rough around the edges at times, its solid and heavy hitting shooting mechanics along with its RPG and stealth elements allow it to appeal to anyone interested in the action genre.\n\n\nPros:\n+A role available to all who enjoy the FPS genre\n+Randomized maps add replay value to missions\n+Weapons feel powerful and weighty\n+Dependency on teamwork without feeling too weak alone\n+Free content updates\n+DLC does not separate the community\n+Great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-Stealth can fail because of synchronization issues and bugs\n-High repetition of missions\n-Absent animations for actions such as jumping\n-Hackers can be prominent in public games\n-Bugs after updates are common\n\nLike the review?

I rather enjoyed Payday 2 when it came out also. Sure there were some problems with the map chooser (cant pick any heist without paying, ect.) But Overkill promised support, and 3 DLC's.\n\nThey lied.\n\nI am not a big fan of lots of DLC, and Overkill decided to put out a bunch of DLC.  Still not a problem, but when the DLC is $6-$8 a pop, and gives us either one new heist or 2 - 3 guns, I am disappointed. Making the bread and butter of the DLC's different masks I still was fine with, even though there is absolutely no way to check out my face in game. If there was some sort of taunt like in TF2 that would put me in the 3rd person view, I would enjoy that more, but as it is there is no way to even enjoy what I am wearing. (Yeah blah blah blah, you can go to your safehouse. Dont even get me started on the lies and deception surrounding that. Almost 2 years and no safehouse upgrades, unlike what Overkill said during pre-production. "It takes time to do good work". smh)\n\nEVEN WITH ALL OF THIS I was not upset. I bought all the DLC up to the Diamond Heist because I found value in it. But when the diamond heist and Clover came out, I did not feel that they were worth it. I was gonna wait for a sale. Then they started doing the butcher stuff, and I still did not buy any DLC because it was still not worth it. Crimefest stuff not completed ("it takes time to do good work") and then the hype train hit and it was $5 for 2 guns (one secondary that does 10000 dmg, gg) and $20 for 4 "unusual" masks (Still cant see my face) and one "Secret" item out of 25 possible secret items. On a RNG. For $20. But hey, whatever, they are going to do a new infamy update anyways and free mod packs. But the free mod pack got turned into a pay mod pack ($5 of course) and when called on it, Overkill said, this is not the mod pack you think it is, this is a different one. Even though it has the same promo image, and it was dropping glitched items from the other mod pack (free one) also. Seems legit. But, hey this is all free, you will get (more) free enemies (when they are done) like the last one ("it takes time to do good work") and the magical Infamy 2.0 is coming out.\n\nInfamy 2.0 came out and it was terrible. 2000 more levels, with the only rewards being masks and XP boosts. (Yo dawg, I put an XP boost into your leveling up, so that you can level while you level) I never felt happier about not buying things. A lot of people felt that this was not good. As a matter of fact, lots of people didn't like it. I read a lot about people cancelling their pre-order of the $5 and $20 overkill packs. There must have been a lot, because they fired out the overkill pack DLC early, IMHO because too many people were cancelling their purchaces. They never did anything like this before ("it takes time to do good work") so I have to assume that they felt the pinch. But the straw that broke the camels back was the 10 acheivements tied to the Overkill pack.\n\nI am a completionist. I love doing acheivements. As a matter of fact, Acheivements are what I do. Now I can not 100% your game without purchacing a limited-time DLC. No. Never. If the game was something that I felt good playing anymore I would in a heartbeat. But no. You sell DLC that is nothing but mods, and then require people to complete acheivements just to get the items you paid for. No. Never again. I enjoyed Payday.\n\nThis is not Payday.","March 6, 2015","false","331.2"," 306 of 394 people (78%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","78","306","394","17","7"

Timing and objective-focused horde shooter with a lot of variation in missions.\n\nGame is absolutely full of DLC, some of it blatantly pay-to-win: Gage mod courier DLC mods are inexcusably essential for 'meta' weapon builds on the highest difficulties, access to thrown explosives is stuck behind dollar signs.\n\nLots and lots of useless items too: many of the vanilla guns were not correctly balanced on release, and are utter trash following several iterations of DLC. There's basically a melee weapon for every level, and there is hardly any differentiation between them - except for the fact that they're all inferior to the default 'weapon butt' attack, and melee combat is horribly skewed against the player.\n\nLong delays in promised content while developers pursue their own 'wacky' alternatives - some well-received, like the Hotline Miami 2 content, others just stupid: Chivalry, John Wick.\n\nLarge lack of maps compared to other forms of content. Playing the same maps with new gear and cosmetics is not as fun as playing new maps with trusty gear.\n\nI will probably keep playing Payday, but I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a serious, challenging, or fun experience.","September 10, 2015","false","836.8"," 146 of 172 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","146","172","8","16"

Missions often get replayed several times, especially as you decide what your favorite type of job is but it hasn't become boring in the slightest because every job has played out differently with changes in the difficulty, people you play with and randomized layouts. Don't waste your time on the offline mode, it'd be worthwhile but the part that kills it is the AI won't carry items for you, leaving you to move the mission along if that's the type involved. Other than that they're smart and can handle themselves in a firefight.\n\nOverall, Payday 2 is one of my favorite co-op games. If you like shooters and can suspend the lawful good part of your brain for a bit, and have friends to play with, you can't go wrong with this game.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196351645","December 3, 2013","true","629.6"," 663 of 911 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","663","911","3","9"

But since then the game turned into a mess. Ignore everything below - Update\n\nIf you're not the type of gamer that play games in multiplayer, you will not enjoy Payday 2. However when playing with three other people is when the game really shines.\n\nPayday 2 offers heists that can be completed without being spotted. You can tie down people as well as security cops, making them your hostage so they won't set of the alarm as you sneak around inside the building, and get away with your loots. However, if you mess up the stealthy part and the alarm goes off, the gameplay changes. Wave after wave, what feels like an entire army of cops will sacrifice themselves trying to prevent you from escaping with the loot. The cops very often behave like they don't really know what they're doing, and can easily be taken down one by one. But the amount of cops can overwhelm you if they catch you off guard.\n\nPayday 2 have a skill system that is split into four categories, focusing on each their thing. One of them is the Mastermind tree that focuses on making you the 'Healer' of the group, while the Enforce tree makes you a freaking Tank. As you level up (Current level cap is 100), you have far enough points to fill up the tree that fits your playstyle, or combine different skills from every tree to really customize your character. The same goes for weapons. You can have two weapons on you, a main and second one, that can all be very well modified as you like. The same goes for Masks.\n\nThe way you receive weapon mods, masks and things to customize your masks, is based on luck. At the end of each heist you complete, you get to choose one of three cards laying next to each other with heads down. The card you choose will decide what sort of item you receive, and it is chosen randomly. I think there should be a better way to obtain weapon mods that isn't based entirely on luck.\n\nOverall I really enjoy Payday 2 and my complains with the game are minimal. I wish it offered more options regarding the stealth part of the game, and I hope the cops will become smarter over time and really fight you back. It is good as it is now however, and I will recommend it!","November 26, 2013","true","219.2"," 484 of 665 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","484","665","2","8"

As much as I DESPISE the addition of microtransaction weapon skins that CHANGE THE STATISTICS AND MECHANICS OF THE GUNS in a PAID game with PAID DLC, this is insult of an update is just the final nail in Overkill's coffin. Our community has been lied to repeatedly, on both a group and individual level. Take the demise of fan websites such as www.pd2stats.com for example. Seriously.

I have reinstalled the game at the time of this writing, and am genuinely enjoying the game again with the addition of content such as the Wolf Pack DLC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hexe_Jager/recommended/218620/","Hexe_Jager","Rampaging Roryholic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hexe_Jager/","297 products in account","I used to be a very rabid Overkill fan, and sang their praises whenever possible for making fun games and having a solid relationship with the playerbase. I don't know what changed, but starting at release, the game was pretty good. In need of some bugfixes and  had some promises that weren't delivered on (Like safehouse customization, which at the time of this review, to my knowledge is STILL absent.), but the game was good. Slowly free content expansions were released, along with the occasional paid DLC that was usually a weapon pack.\n\nHowever, around the release of the sniper pack, power creep started getting out of control. From the .50 cal being able to one shot Bulldozers on high difficulty (An impossible feat with any weapon prior to it's release), leading up to later DLC's just giving you an RPG launcher. Someone who buys none of the DLC won't have access to things like: Grenades, RPG's, Sniper Rifles, some of the best shotguns in the game, the best ARs in the game. That's not even counting the now rather high number of paid heists (Which in the interest of being fair, can still be played by anyone as long as the host owns the DLC). DLC still, however, started getting out of control.\n\nPayday is a very grind heavy game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, it is almost offensive to low level players how poor the payouts for low difficulty missions are, and considering you need large amounts of in game money to add stat altering modifications to your guns or to buy the guns in the first place (And even more money to expand how many slots of inventory you have) a new player almost has to be carried through much less forgiving trials while learning the ropes to start being useful. The skill system also has it's flaws. While they are minor gripes, as the system does keep things interesting with varying builds. Some skills felt like mandatory point sinks, like having to put points into one skill tree for more than 2 cable ties (Which are extremely important for controlling hostages and freeing jailed heisters).\n\nBut even all of that could be overlooked and the game enjoyed. However, like many ex-heisters, the promise Overkill broke that removed any good will I had for the dev and game was the one of not having microtransactions. It was stated by Almir over a year ago that Payday 2 would never have microtransactions. As of a few months ago, that is untrue. A recent update added a crate/key system much like CS:GO for weapons skins. Big deal right? They're just random drops that are only cosmetic, who cares? Don't be so entitled. Except, they grant stats. That's right, an RNG based microtransaction laden system grants stats to weapons. Even more insulting, a team using multiple boost granting skins receive more payouts than those without, it's about as P2W as you get in a purely PvE game.\n\nI liked the game way back, but it has honestly become a DLC bloated, microtransaction filled husk of what I enjoyed, with developers that forgot why they even had a good reputation and sales in the first place. The fans they spat on and told to give them more money.\n\nIf the game is on sale, as it does so very often, you can get some decent play time out of it. However, buyer beware that your experience without DLC and microtransactions is vastly different from someone with all the DLC.","December 10, 2015","false","281.8"," 105 of 125 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","105","125","2","6"

I had hoped for more but i would have accepted the little content there was and i would have appreciated for what it is. What i cant accept however is Overkills DLC policy.\nSadly DLC has become a huge part of modern games, but Overkill truly takes it to the next level.\nAt the moment there is DLC worth somewhere around 110€ in the game, most of it being guns or gun attachements, but there are also quite a lot of heists hidden behind a paywall. Now i'm sure a lot of people are screaming at the screen right now trying to convince themselves that the DLC is completely optional, that however is only half true.\nBecause what is a heisting game without the heists?\nYou're not going to enjoy this game too much with only the basegame heists and the free updates that come along every year or so dont really add that much gameplay either.\nNow aside from the DLC, they added another feature to the game, which basically gives you gun skins which gives you a bonus to your stats. These gun skins can only be optained from saves which can only be opened with drills that you have to buy with real money. This cs:go esqué pay2win update has been the last straw for me.\nOverkill tries to squeeze the most they can out of the customer with the least amount of work possible.\nA big amount of content they have added to the game over time, actually came from the modders in the payday community. Overkill literally copies their code and charges you for it.\nAnd if you ever try to criticise them on the steam forum you can expect your posts to be removed instantly and you may even be banned.\nSo, should you give your money to Overkill?\nNo.\nNot even if the game is on a 90% sale.\nDont support these terrible devs and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.","October 15, 2015","false","158.8"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","64","66","0","0"

All of those games have never tried to ♥♥♥♥ their community quite like OVERKILL has.\n\nI think Payday 2 is a good game. I would probably call it a great game. However, OVERKILL is just one, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing company with absolutely horrible business practices and service to fans. The game is nearly impossible to play without DLC. You have to buy DLC to have access to almost anything. On top of that, OVERKILL still seems to release bi-monthly DLC and charge for it.\nThen comes crimefest. The game's community grinded for weeks and got hyped up for a [free, wow] update to the game. What do we get? Microtransactions. Almir gave us microtransactions. Now, this wouldn't be much of a problem. However the gun skins that you buy with these microtransactions gives your guns an actual in game advantage. That's pay2win.\nDidn't the developers of this game once say that they were never going to have microtransactions in game? Well, they completely went back on it and betrayed their entire fanbase.\n\nCrimefest brings free updates? Yeah, You're free to give overkill more money.\n\nThe day is now October 25, 2015. Overkill made the statement that they would discuss microtransactions with the players after crimefest. If you look here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3q53ms/crimefest_is_over_ama_discussion_with_almir_on/\n\nIt's very clear that Almir and overkill had no intention to ever remove microtransactions, and no intention to take a discussion with the fanbase seriously. This game was my favorite co-op shooter, and now it has a place in my "pile of dogshit" folder along with Bad Rats. I've uninstalled the game, and have no intention of reinstalling unless microtransactions are removed and Almir gives a proper apology and a proper crimefest to the players.\n\n♥♥♥♥ you Overkill.\n\n♥♥♥♥ you Almir.\n\nI hope your ♥♥♥♥ing studio burns down.","October 15, 2015","false","317.4"," 66 of 69 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","66","69","0","0"

In the beginning, this sequel was even better. Then they started churning out one or two five-dollar DLC every month with a few weapons or a new map. I was okay with that for a while. It was optional and half of them were free.\n\nBut they really started to pile up. Where other game studios would have been working on their next game, Overkill decided they would just work on one game forever, apparently. To fund this obsession/laziness/whatever it is, they decided to ♥♥♥♥ their customers out of as much money as they would allow. Sadly, many customers allow them to bend them over and have their way with them and then ask for more.\n\nThey introduced CS: GO style skins that are acquired from paid unboxing, except unlike those kinds of systems, the skins rarely have an additional stat boost. This would already be unbalanced and an unacceptable pay-to-win mechanic that shouldn't exist at all, let alone in a paid game. But to make matters worse, they nerfed many of the weapons already in the game so that people would have to get these skins just to have weapons that work at all.\n\nThis ridiculous skin fiasco was the immediate predecessor to their still ongoing attempt to make this game a viable 'e-sports' title, because they've ramped their greed all the way up and have decided they need some of that pie in addition to the princely sum they've already milked from their dwindling playerbase.\n\nThe outcry over their actions was such that even their forum moderators went on strike over it. In their arrogance, they announced a hollow apology while steadfastly refusing to back down from their exploitative practices.\n\nFollowing this game's current trajectory, I expect them to announce a monthly subscription fee some time in the near future. I could say more, but I better hurry up and get this review posted before they start charging $2.99 for it.","November 23, 2015","false","131.8"," 110 of 134 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","110","134","10","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/218620/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","PAYDAY 2 is the 2013 sequel to highly-acclaimed PAYDAY: The Heist game, improving upon it's predeccessor in a variety of fields. Your objective is to team up with up to three other players and execute a variety of heists of both small and big degrees to gain cash. Alongside you gain experience to level up, weapon mods, masks and materials for customizing them, you can buy and customize your weapons, gain new skills, etc.\n\nThe core gameplay feels right. Shooting stuff, aiming for their heads, moving bags, using cover to your advantage, while some of it is a hassle and the game itself is a major grind, it's a fun experience with a variety of heists to perform, weapons to try out, and skills to use. Of course the general quality is higher if you have friends to play with, but even with randoms it tends to not be as crappy as in some other co-op games.\n\nThe graphics might not be top-notch, but they're nice enough and at some points even kind of impressive for what they are. In the sound department, the voice acting is great, it's fun to listen to people such as Hoxton and Jiro spouting out random lines of dialogue, and the music composed by Simon Viklund (who also provides the voice of Bain) can be impressive at times (my favorite being Evil Eye).\n\nThe game can also be modded to a pretty high extent, and while updates often break some mods, they are just as quickly fixed back into usability.\n\nNow, the questionable thing right now are DLCs. Some of them are character packs that provide a new character, new perk deck, and a few weapons, some are whole heist DLCs providing the best amount of content overall, and majority of them are weapon packs that only give out new weapons. Now, there are two main controversies related to them - their rather high amount and the fact that they're often required if you want to deal with certain situations a lot more easily, and unfortunately both of them are kinda true. There is LOTS of DLC and getting them all will cost more than the base game itself, and some enemies (like Captain Winters for example) are painful to deal with if you don't have the DLC sniper rifles or DLC molotovs. This isn't the best practice, but a lot of people, including myself to some extent, defended it as being a result of the game growing, developing, and the DLCs providing some sensible content for the most part.\n\nBut then, Black Market happened.\n\nAt first I thought it was a joke - safes? Drills? Weapon skins? Just like in CS:GO? I couldn't believe it. But the realization slowly came to me. The bad memories of Team Fortress 2's Gun Mettle Update came rushing in. Introducing microtransactions into the game by blatantly copying Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was a horrible, atrocious move on Overkill's part. Besides them saying PAYDAY 2 would never have microtransactions, they even gave the skins stat boosts so they're not cosmetic-only! They might not seem like a big deal at first glance, but sometimes that +4 accuracy might push the weapon into perfect accuracy territory, which is enough to make a gigantic difference. The worst of those are +concealment skins, providing a TON more versatility in loadouts for dodge builds relying on high concealment, even sometimes allowing them to outright make the weapon more concealable than what is considered to be the maximum! I can defend the DLCs as being meaningful, but this... this is just a lazy cashgrab with heavy P2W mechanics that aren't cheap either. Doesn't help that they later made then even worse by introducing team boosts that give bonus experience and cash after completing heists if you use those skins.\n\nFast-forward a few months later, after all that time of silence (and another paid DLC released in meantime, ironically) they decided to finally do something good: add stat boosts as weapon modifications to the drop table (and they have the same drop rate as other weapon mods). That actually removes the P2W aspect of skins, but the skins themselves and the microtransactions, as well as Overkill's horrendous handling of the angered fanbase and months of not doing anything to remedy that leave a very sour taste in my mouth. They messed up really badly and took way too long to fix it, refusing to communicate with the fanbase and dodging their questions in the meantime. I certainly will think twice about buying anything from them again after this.\n\nSo, does that mean I can give this game a positive review? Well... no. Granted I am more "mixed" rather than "negative" now but the trust I had in them was permamently ravaged. I'd say buy it if it's on a good sale, but otherwise don't even bother. The game is fun and entertaining, but the devs handled it really badly and who knows what they will come up with in the future.","November 8, 2015","false","295.6"," 112 of 137 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","112","137","0","14"

Is it worth it to lose almost every single one of your loyal fans, many of us who had been playing since the first game? Is it worth it to lose all of our cash when we reluctantly kept buying your DLC ♥♥♥♥♥torms?\n\nRant ahead.\n\nThis game used to be pretty amazing when it first came out. Sure, it didn't had much content, but it was still fun. Updates were frequent and most of them were free, with new heists and stuff like that. Then, the DLC ♥♥♥♥ storm came. A gun pack here. Another gun pack over there, a new paid heist here. That was decent. I mean, the first KF had gun packs. If you don't count re-skins...Just 3 of them. This one? A ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ TON. Most of them include gimmicky weapons that aren't really that useful in game, like fire weapons, and guns that you'll never use, just for the sake of curiosity. Tons of lore unfriendly characters, that felt like somebody keeps adding their Original characters (Do not steal), messing up with the lore and history of the characters by forcefully inserting new acquaintances that were never before seen. And what's worse, this game is pretty much a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥ now. It ♥♥♥♥♥s itself for cash and keeps doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crossovers that are lackluster at best, atrocious at worst. I mean, I was okay with having ♥♥♥♥ing Keanu Reeves in game, but then after a while, came the whole ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID Goat Sim crossover that makes me want to kill myself. The problem is, lots of these DLCs come out once or twice per month, and they are obviously rushed. In true Overkill fashion, these DLC packs, heists, and weapons often come INFESTED with bugs, sometimes even game breaking.\n\nWell, we still had plenty of DLC shoved up our asses and stuff, it's...Okay...And then...\n\nThe major ♥♥♥♥♥torm came.....\n\nOverkill decided to add microtransactions in game. After they said years ago that they wouldn't, "Shame on us" if we thought otherwise. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon skins (Because now what CSGO did is going to haunt us all, right? Because it makes more dosh?). The worst part is, they actually changed stats on the weapons. They had stat boosts. That's right, the game became pay to win for a bit. Overkill tried to save their asses from the ♥♥♥♥♥torm of biblical proprtions that almost ravaged them, and they can't get rid of the hatred they earned even to this day. First, "Oh wait guys! We'll actually give each of you a free skin! Heh, that's what you want, right?"\nThen, they got rid of the stats (I think)\n\nTL;DR\n\nThis game is still the cheap ♥♥♥♥♥ that does crossovers with everybody, the skins are still there, and you'll get ♥♥♥♥ tons of overpriced, buggy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC on a monthly basis. Do not bother with this game. It used to be pretty cool, but those days are long gone. I enjoyed this game. It's a shame that it had to die in such a long, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way. Do not support these scummy developers, get another game.","April 5","false","169.4"," 107 of 130 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","107","130","9","12"

It was ok back then but lacked content (very few levels, no end game content) and was buggy (guards could see through walls which ruined stealth for me).\n\nNow I'm getting back to the game and I'm surprised how much it improved. There's a lot more missions, equipment, the Death Wish difficulty for real challenges and a very nice Infamy system too keep you playing after level 100 .\n\nWhat's better is that the devs keep adding things and have more updates scheduled. That's a very good way to keep the game alive.\n\nI could complain that half of the DLCs cost money, but then again another half is free and at least the cash flow is used too keep improving the game.\n\nThe mechanics are solid, both shooting and sneaking feels nice. The graphics are good for today's standards. The voice acting is superb – so are the 'miniseries' intros filmed with real actors.\n\nThe game still has some bugs, the worst being connection issues, but nothing I can't live with.\n\nThe community is pretty ok. I see almost no trolls and griefers. Most pub players don't communicate though, so it's best to play with friends or meet some people on the official forums.\n\nBut let me warn you – the game is extremely grindy. But then it gives you enough challenges and rewards too keep the grind interested.\n\nAll in all Payday 2 is one of the best co-op games on Steam and a very good choice for both fps and stealth game enthusiasts.","November 10, 2014","true","689.0"," 178 of 235 people (76%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","76","178","235","12","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hoovyspenser/recommended/218620/","Hoovyspenser","R.I.P My Computer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hoovyspenser/","81 products in account","[UPDATED REVIEW 2.0]\n\nPayday 2 was one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played but I never thought to this day that the game would turn downhill. It's been a month since ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2015 has come along breaking up the community. Again, the post-update 79 is still being frowned and disappointed upon by the community including Steam Forums, Reddit, etc, even news article commented about this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo what happened? Well Overkill 'apology' to the community is not good enough, Almir's AMA and interview is downvoted and disgusted by many players. Yes, they have 'fixed' a few things such as adding drills to the Card Drop and added new content; the only content that is considered a "reward" in my opinion is the First World Bank, new awesome songs by Le Castle Vania and that's pretty much it, most of the content from Crimefest is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow what else did the community got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about? Well just read below.\n\nThe only thing that I hate starting from Update 79 are obviously the microtransactions, broken weapon rebalance (Which Overkill are currently looking at), Overkill's lack of response to the community's negative feedbacks and you'll find more details below:\n\nEver since the 79th update, The Black Market Update aka First day of Crimefest was disappointing and here what it offers.\nWeapon Skins - The problem with this feature is unlike TF2 Gun Mettle's weapon skins or CS:GO skins in general, the skins in Payday 2 are NOT purely cosmetic by adding stat boosts to it. It's unnecessary and unrealistic as the game does take itself seriously. (Sure, there has been some joke weapons but this is ridiculous)\n\nWeapon Rebalance - Unfortunately, I asked the people in the PD2 Discussion Forums and they say that the 'rebalance' is pathetic such as "pistols are now OP" and "a revolver can 4 shot kill a dozer (Very tough, high HP enemy)" and because of that, I'm not sure anyone else can really enjoy Payday 2 with these rebalances anymore but that doesn't stop me from using my same arsenal so it doesn't really affect me.....yet.\n\nMicrotransactions - Yep, I said it: MICROTRANSACTIONS on a full-fledged PC game. Due to my experiences on mobile games, I found microtransactions truly disgusting but on a PC game? What? Really? You serious, Overkill?\nFrom my knowledge, in order to get skins you'll have to pay real life money to get them but not just that; similiar to TF2 and CS:GO, there're cases in the game that can be found by card drops (acted as Safes) and in order to unlock them, you'll have to pay real life money to buy a key (acted as Drills). It blows my mind about this feature after what they  explicitly said before: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/24240/discussions/0/810924774517838925/#c810925398555174856\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521\nI know it's a former Payday 2 Director but he wouldn't say that if the rest of Overkill disagreed against him.\n\nI think I just covered what this update has to offer and seeing our promises from Overkill being broken and make the First Day content from Crimefest being paid instead of free is atrocious and Overkill needs to reconsider everything about this right now, even if it's been one month since!\n\nNow Update 90, I'm alright with the new heist "Lab Rats" being permanently playable after the Halloween event but now they introduced a new feature: Team Boost which gives players more money and Experience Points only if one of your crew members have a skin and it stacks as well so in my opinion, this is a pretty stupid feature but it's more than just a feature, it's an advertisement that ask you to buy weapon skins so your crew can get more EXP and money.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3sl9t7/♥♥♥♥_you_overkill_20/\n\nBut it didn't end there, this update also includes two new SAFES!\nThe Completely Overkill Safe and the Dallas Safe.\nThe CO Safe is what made some of the moderators refused to work on the PD2 Steam forums, good job Overkill.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/8/496881136905452713/\nAnd the Dallas Safe is nothing more than another ♥♥♥♥ing advertisement to buy drills so you can get a team boost.\nSeriously, what's up with the ♥♥♥♥ing safes? This has to stop already!\nI don't want to see anymore new safes, no Hoxton Safe, no Wolf Safe, no Chains Safe; JUST STOP WITH THE SAFES ALREADY!!\nBut it doesn't matter, Almir himself said that his company cares more about the money than the community so what's even the point of complaining anyway?\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3q53ms/crimefest_is_over_ama_discussion_with_almir_on/\n\nOverkill, you ♥♥♥♥ed up and nobody doesn't want their game to get ♥♥♥♥ed up by you greedy sums of ♥♥♥♥♥es.\n\nTL:DRGame is great but the new updates just ruined it for me and lots of other people with microtransactions, weapon skins boost the original's stats and gives the team bonus money and EXP, the weapon rebalance needs to get rework on, Overkill cares more about money than the community & etc.\n\nOverkill, hurry up and use my review to improve your game that we, the community loved & cared, I wanted to defend you but the microtransactions, disgusting responses and broken Crimefest promises just went too far so please fix it already!\n\nThank you to anyone who reads my review.","November 17, 2015","false","93.4"," 92 of 109 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","92","109","2","10"

Source: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521\nAdditionally, the skins are not worth it and very bad described. Some of them tell you in the workshop to actually give you stats where they don't and vice versa. I highly recommend NOT to buy them at all. I don't like the skins + their stats in total are usually not worth it. Also don't buy high priced skins. I checked the stats, they're not worth the price.\nAlso you might wanna waste a lot of money to play well in this game due to certain mods for weapons or weapons themselves.\nThis game used to be good but it's getting destroyed more and more. I no longer recommend buying this game due to OVERKILL for whatever reason heading the wrong way.\nHang on... they're trying to support XP users? How many people are even using a XP running computer anymore whereas Microsoft not even supports that OS anymore and besides, can you even run a single heist on that old operating system...? PAYDAY 2 is a lot about performance and you need a high quality graphics card to actually play the game without lags whereas it already uses very lame graphics.\nI'd say you better off wait for The Walking Dead to arrive and hope they're making that game better.\n\nOh and here's some update on the point: http://imgur.com/hN6zqJZ\nPretty much describes everything that's going on in my head.","October 16, 2015","false","389.2"," 64 of 69 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","64","69","2","35"

Maybe you have an alter ego to have a criminal life? No? Well, i can say this game is about Bag thrower/Drilling/Picklocking/"F" and "G" Simulator.\n\n- Slapped the guard with money, and he's dead.\n- Shouting "Get the fu*k up!" will save your partner from dying by a magic skill. Bullets in his body just gone.\n- You'll learn how to cook meth from a guy who just search it on internet. Heisenberg made a blog!\n- Giancarlo Esposito played as The Dentist in The Big Bank DLC. Breaking bad?\n- Keanu Reeves, umm i mean John Wick as new PAYDAY member with dual gun skill.\n- Old Hoxton is back!\n\nReview for pay to win the dlcs:\nSo many dlcs. Probably, i won't update the review anymore.\n\n- If you want to buy dlcs, Gage Mod Pack and Sniper Pack are recommended for better mod and sniper to take care the law enforcers especially dozer's family.\n- Light Machine Gun from Gage Weapon Pack 2? Nah! Hard to aim because you can't aim through scope unless you got laser equipped. High spread and recoil. Not really recommended unless you want to be Rambo.\n- Gage shotgun pack is mediocre dlc. You'll get some new shotguns and bullets but non-dlc shotguns already good. But HE round, a new bullet type for shotgun is awesome. Like grenade but smaller explosion. It can stun dozer for a while by one shot. Good for crowd control. If you are surrounded by law enforcers, this will make them fly. Keep those helm...bodies flying!\n- Assault Rifles from Gage Assault Pack are good for you who like variety or probably if you are bored using a heavy modded CAR-4 which is "best AR" (i think) can switch to ARs from this dlc with acceptable stats compared that CAR-4 and high rates of fire. But you have to do the achievements first to unlock the new AR's mods. Gage Mod Pack is still enough if you don't want to spent money to this dlc.\nTL;DR FAMAS guys?\n- Hotline Miami DLC has good secondary weapons like UZI and Skorpio. Also, the heist isn't stealthable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Badstormer/recommended/218620/","Badstormer","Badstormer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Badstormer/","179 products in account","The game isn't terrible, but it doesn't seem to be 'complete'.\n\nAlthough it far exceeds Payday: The Heist (More realistic gun mechanics, unlocks, customizable weapons, masks, customizable masks, quite a lot of new stuff in general), they failed to release things that they (1) Promised to release and were (2) In the original Payday.\n\nThe game itself gets very repetitive, very fast. At first, it'll be fun. You get to choose how you want to handle the robbery. However, there aren't exactly a lot of ways to handle said robbery. Soon after completing one a few times, you'll come to realize this.\n\n\nAnyway, enough explaining, I'll get right to the pros/cons.\n\n\nPros\n----------------\n- Partially Realistic Weaponry\n- More ways to complete a robbery\n- More weaponry\n- Customizable weapons\n- A few classic units from Payday: The Heist still exist here\n- Planning Phase in lobbies, blueprints and optional upgrades in said phase.\n- For those that hate the game, it's a piece of cake to cheat on. Literally no punishment is handed out.\n--------------------\nCons\n-----------------\n- Frequent payed DLC's are released, mostly stuff that was promised to be added to the main game.\n- Forum threads deleted to silence people who accused the Payday 2 developers of lying (which they certianly did)\n- Past level 40, you'll realize that there's hardly anything 'new' to do in the game other than grind\n- Very limited amount of robberies, although there are more than there are in The Heist\n- Card System: You get a random 'bonus' after completing a robbery. Sometimes it's cash, others experience, sometimes it's a modification, a mask, a mask modification, etc. You may ask why this is bad - it's the ONLY way to get these things. It's literally 100% luck.\n- One less AI on your side in Singeplayer, as if it wasn't already hard enough to solo.\n- 30% of the game is pretty much just a bag throwing simulator.\n- Repetitive heists; you've seen one of them, you've seen all of them.\n- Usual heist: (1) Infiltrate the place. (2) Get into the vault. (3) Grab the loot. (4) Take the loot and attempt to dodge bullets (and fail) while heading to the escape van. (5) Escape. Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time, it's the same thing, just a different map.\n- "Five dollars to buy grenades? Seriously?" - I see a lot of people comment on the weapon packs. Honestly, you can live without them if you're willing to give up a few achievements and slightly more firepower.\n- Takes a relatively high-end computer to run decently on low settings.\n- Annoying as hell AI; I've once had a Bulldozer spawn right in front of me. Guess what happened next.\n- Cheaters. Recently, their populations has slowly been dropping, but they still exist. The game has no anti-cheat whatsoever, so they're free to come back and destroy the game once more, and other people have nothing stopping them from cheating. Yet.\n- I could go on for hours about this, but that's the summary.\n----------------------\n\nOverall, this game isn't worth the money. Take it from someone who's tried Payday: The Heist, Payday 2 Beta, someone who has the DLC's for the games, and has given each a lengthly amount of time in-game.\n\nI'd give this game a 4/10, taking into consideration the developers will silence any criticism that they can possibly find. Maybe when they start giving us free DLC's that should have been in the damn game in the first place I'll change my rating of this game. Only reason I still bother to hop onto it is for it's achievements. (Yes, I'm insane.)\n\nIf you want something that's more of a rage-game than a robbery game, Payday 2 is the game for you. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and forget this game. If I could get a refund, I sure as hell would.\n\nEDIT - 5/28/2014 - Overkill has been releasing a lot of (terrible) DLC for the game recently, as well as paying very little attention to the bugs in the game, plus the ridiculous amount of cheaters. (They fix a good amount of bugs, but there's a helluvalot more that they fail to fix.) - They reduced the size of the game, yes, but it's still a massive wait for an update/reinstall. Alongside that, their idea of an anti-cheat is to label someone as a cheater in-game. THAT'S IT. Surely by now, they'd have a better idea as to how to track down modified .lua files. Anyway, the rest of the review still stands as it is, just with a lot of terrible weaponry added and a whopping 2 new heists after many, many months of waiting.\n\nAnother EDIT - 6/17/2014 - They're starting to add heists to the game that were originally promised to be thrown into the game. Now you get to pay an extra $7 for ONE EXTRA HEIST that is a tiny bit larger than a normal one.\n\nEdit 2.5 - 6/17/2014 -  It turns out they also have a minus-boost system in place; if you play the same heist more than once in a row, you get a decrease in the amount of exp you get. So, getting to level 100 5 times to finally get all 5 Infamous ranks will take what was originally weeks to what is now months. Hope you enjoy.\nIf you play one heist over too many times, you get a 100% minus-boost permanently. Likely a bug, but that's Overkill for you.\n\nEDIT - 2/27/2014 -  Alright, they're starting to actually fix things in the game - of course, with every new DLC they throw at us, the developers break more things than they've ever fixed. Alongside that, cheaters are still not being punished. Ever since Payday: The Heist (Payday 1), nothing at all has been done about cheaters. Not a single ban, not a single temporary ban, not a single ♥♥♥♥ has been given. If you do grab this game, make sure you check everyone's profile that you've got in your lobby to ensure they do not have a large amount of achievements unlocked within a very short timespan in Payday 2 to ensure they do not cheat.\n\nEDIT: 7/3/2014 - Removed the con 'uninstalling and reinstalling the game'. What I meant by that is the game automatically unzips an entirely new download of itself, then just overwrites the updated files, rather than downloading only the updated files. They seem to have fixed this issue.\n\nEDIT: 8/3/2014 - Apparently people insist that are very few cheaters in the game. Personally, I come across an absurd amount of them, but most other people seem to never come across any. I'm likely just unlucky. Rather or not you want to pay attention to the (possible) cheater population is up to you. Personally, I've come across a lot less cheaters in the past week or so, so perhaps they are correct. Also modified the 'Cheaters' con.","February 27, 2014","false","73.2"," 679 of 999 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","679","999","0","38"

You had 6 heists (plus 3 DLCs) that had to be beaten in one way only.\n\nHowever, in the sequel, there are a lot more things. Let's take a look at all of them.\n\n1) Heists\nThere are currently over 20 heists in the game (including DLCs). They go from delivering coke and robbing a bank to destroying a mall and attacking armored transports.\n\n2) Gameplay\nNow most of the heists can be beaten stealthily: you can move hostages and get rid of bodies by putting them in body bags. There are many more weapons to buy and, for the most part, they feel different, also thanks to...\n\n3) Customization\nYou can customize every weapon in its entirety: grip, external barrel, upper receiver, sights... You can also get over 100 masks and customize them through colors, materials and patterns. Modifications, masks and items are unlocked through a card drop at the end of each round.\n\nThere are some problems, however: the game lacks in the Video options, missing both anti-aliasing and shadow options (this can be, however, changed using the Shadow map mod. Look in the guides for more infos). Also, the AI isn't always that brilliants, and I've wasted multiple enemies because they didn't notice me in front of them.\n--------------------------\nEDIT: since this review was made, Overkill has introduced stat-boosting, microtransactions and even safes to be unlocked with paid keys to get better skins with better stats for your weapons. The gunplay and gameplay is still unaltered, but the inclusion of this aspects has ruined the game for a lot of players, so if you don't like what I just mentioned, avoid this game.\n--------------------------\nOverall, this is a great sequel, constantly updated, with a kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack and improved gameplay.

In it's current state it's a joke.\n\nI've put my fair share of time into this game. Spent a fair share of money on this game as well. I've convinced old players to come back to this game after leaving it.\n\nNo more. Payday will not get any more from me. I'm over it. I feel like I got so badly screwed over by this game.\n\nIt used to be the game for me. Now it's something I don't really enjoy being reminded about.\n\nHere's a bit more info for those of you who are still reading:\n\n"Many summarize the issue as "it went pay to win", but that's missing all of the important background. P2w was a problem, but it wasn't the problem. PAYDAY 2 had already begun introducing p2w in its very first DLC. The real problem was that Overkill Software built itself a powder keg, sat on it, lit the fuse, and then tried to put out the fuse with gasoline.\n\nDon't think that this was an isolated failure. Overkill dragged their feet on fixing simple issues that the scripting community had fixed for months. They did more blatant cashgrabbing over time with promotional content and gimmick DLCs sold at $5 or $7 each. They ran an event that explicitly tied purchases of PAYDAY 2 DLC to later rewards. They paid practically no attention to weapon balance (and considering what they did later, it was better off without their attention at all). They ignored fair play between DLC/non-DLC users for the longest time. They hyped up new a enemy twice, and gave us something stationary and tedious to fight both times.\n\nThis pileup of cash-grabbing, misplaced priorities, and general incompetence had become too big for them to simply placate the fans with more free content. That's our keg.\n\nFlash to mid-October 2015. The second annual Crimefest event. PAYDAY fanatics had been grinding out in-game milestones for the past half-month to unlock rewards for Crimefest. The reward descriptions were cryptic to the point of irrelevance, so speculation had been running wild for weeks. You know what Overkill gave us for the first day of Crimefest?\n\nUgly skins with stat bonuses and a comical failure of a weapon "rebalance". The subreddit lit up like a Christmas tree, but the disaster didn't stop there. The "damage control" over the fan outrage made it very obvious that the leadership at Overkill was completely out of tune with the fans, like an old man trying to do gangsta rap to fit in with a tournament of nerds. This is where the constant mockery over broken promises and "the numbers show that players are loving it" came from.\n\nThe later Crimefest and post-Crimefest content patched over some of the issues or were good in their own right, but the damage had already been done. The subreddit's top posts are filled with backlash, game went from 90% to 75% in Steam reviews out of 180k reviews, and a lot of the old guard left for greener pastures.\n\nYou probably didn't need a post half as long as this, but I felt I had to say something because I'm one of those butthurt PAYDAY veterans (2348 hours) and I can't stop picking at the incredible stupidity like it's an itchy scab. ♥♥♥♥ like this deserves to be told and mocked for all of eternity."","January 20","false","562.4"," 70 of 81 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","70","81","2","11"

I do not make this review lightly, and I myself have played the game thoroughly. I however cannot forgive some of this game's faults. They are the following:\n\n-Terrible money-grab DLC's. The gage shotgun pack is perhaps the worst here, and in my opinion the courier pack is perhaps the best (simply due to the fact that you now have some slight control over what gun attachments you are getting). But to pay $5+ to recieve a few specific guns only to have all of the modifications locked behind impossible to get achievements is ridiculous. For example, "Unusual Suspects" in the Watchdogs job, you have to complete the mission with four different friends all wearing different DLC masks. This is an obvious ploy to convince your friends to waste their money on the DLC as well so you can get the mods the achievement unlocks. While you are not necessarily forced to buy the dlc content, the game does get dull after a while, and the presence of all the DLC makes it all the more obvious that if you want a few more hours of gameplay out of this game the devs are going to milk you for all it's worth and then some.\n\n-Mob spam. What's that? You crave more difficulty? Instead of perhaps, improving the AI, allow us to instead drown you in a sea of tasers and shields to create the illusion of difficulty!\n\n-Specials are ridiculous. Shields are perhaps the most annoying considering they trace your exact movement to the point that they will clip the shield through their body to block you. Don't expect to be able to shoot their hands or feet either. Tasers have a tendency to hit you through cars, and they have almost no cooldown from what I can tell. Cloakers, clearly equiped in light armor, can take up to 3 shotgun shells to the face before finally dying. I'd say the only thing done right are the bulldozers.\n\n-There are no real tactics once you've gone loud. Expect to everyone to just run around the map. You honestly can't completely hold a position or a room due to the AI's instict of simply walking right up to you (or THROUGH you). Your team full of random people will most likely just be wandering the map doing their own thing unless it's strictly stealth. AI can hardly use cover. The game will basically zerg you to death.\n\n-This game uses card draw at the end of every heist to determine if you get a mask, a mod, a pattern (for mask), instant cash, or a colorscheme (for pattern). Cards tend to get very repetitive very fast. This alone would be fine, but the game has a way of punishing you for trying to farm these cards by debuffing your experience points (The largest exp reduction I have recieved was -15%, which is quite significant on Overkill). You will undoubtedly reach a point in the game where you have more money than actual stuff to buy.\n\n-AI teammates are the definition of useless. They cannot grab bags, they will not restart drills, and hell-- they can't even shoot straight. Basically the only thing you'll be doing by having AI teammates is giving yourself a couple of bullet sponges while you do all the actual work. They also have really bad judgement over weather to shoot the enemy or revive you, so expect the AI to do neither effectively.\n\n-No system for migrating hosts. Doesn't matter how long you've spent on a heist, if the player who started the lobby disconnects, all of your time has essentially just been wasted. This is a giant problem.\n\n-Game will randomly go out of sync. AI can be random places compared to other people's game. It gets especially confusing when AI flip a switch when in your view they are on the other side of a wall.\n\n- Finally, pay and experience don't really seem to correlate with mission difficulty. Some missions just aren't worth doing unless you're going for either variety or a skull mask.\n\nAll-in-all, the game is definitely bearable, but having steam friends who play the game aswell was pretty much the only reason for the amount of hours I've poured into this game. These things I have listed are simply what finally drove me away from the game.\n\n(Also, anyone who feels so inclined as to try to give me tips on how to play the game, don't bother. I've logged over 200 hours into this game. I've figured everything out, there is really nothing you could possibly inform me of that I don't already know. If you have any objections as to the things I have stated I will revise this review accordingly.)","December 8, 2014","false","231.7"," 692 of 1,020 people (68%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","68","692","1","66","31"

Most of the content within Payday 2 is locked behind a paywall, all the good weapons are locked behind a paywall, all the weapon attachments are locked behind a paywall, and all the good maps are locked behind a paywall. The game has over $100 dollars of microtransactions in it, even though previously the developers stated that it would not (Source: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/). The recent update was supposed to add content "for free", another lie since we got CSGO/TF2-esque crates that unlock skins that not only make your gun look awful, but makes them better.

Absolutely. However, I would strongly suggest against buying this game now. Unless you are ready to shell out an extra $130 dollars for DLCs, I would recommend spending your money elsewhere.

There is no denying the game is fun but it has so many problems that i can no longer just ignore and hide under the carpet.\n\nI'd be willing to pay for more of their DLCs, honestly, but the quality of the content is falling.\n\nTheir first DLC, the wolfpack for PDTH, was excellent. 2 whole new heists that were different to everything else, a new skill tree and some shiny new weapons.\n\nnowadays you get 1 heist. 1 gun. 4 generic melees and 4 masks.\n\nSometimes with a separate heister pack, adding two masks, a heister and a gun.\n\nThing is, their prices haven't changed, but the content they put out has gotten worse in quality. If they made fewer DLCs, but made the actual content in them truly amazing, I'd be willing to buy them again.\n\nThings began to change about when they released big bank. they only gave us one gun and one heist, but the heist was very big and was worth the pennies, and then so was Golden Grin more recently.\n\nHowever, the other smaller packs, like say the character packs, are not worth the same amount as a pack of good weapons, yet overkill are flogging them for the same amount.\n\nOverkill, if you get your ♥♥♥♥ together I will change this review. but... I think its too late for that now, sadly.\n\nOn another note, game performance is... poor. Most heists are poorly optimized and recently they have made changes to fix it. Unfortunately i cant claim to see any improvements, but then again my PC isn't capable of hitting 30 in this game normally. (funny. i can play project cars with 40 fps...)\n\nEDIT 13/2/16 - Overkill released the wolfpack dlc. a start, but still lacking content.

Thanks to Realzameer for constructive criticism and Scoobert "The Cool Guy" Doobert for error-checking.\n\nGame Summary:\nOriginally posted by Wikipedia:Payday 2 (stylized as PAYDAY 2) is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by   Overkill Software . Two years after the events of the previous game, a reformed Payday Gang come to the Washington, D.C. area to heist. The player takes control of one of the gang members and heists alone, with up to two AI players, as four player cooperative play or some combination of the previous to rob banks, do political engineering, traffic narcotics and more. The game differs on the previous by allowing much more customization of the player and reworking its stealth mechanics.\nBody:\nFor starters, I will say I thoroughly enjoyed playing PD2 (Payday 2) when it was first gifted to me and for a decent amount of time afterwards. I enjoyed it so much that for multiple days at a time, I would only play PD2. That, sadly, has changed in a very negative way. Over the past months, I have gained less and less pleasure out of playing the game, therefore spending less time with it. The increased number of patches and reworks over this time period did not help and just confused me as to why it was necessary. I am at the point where I do not even have the game installed anymore, because in my mind,  it just isn't as fun as it used to be.\n\nWith the fact that I spent a good amount of money and time on this game, I felt it necessary to finally give an honest review and not something like “lol, this is beast benk r0bing simu1ator evar! 420/69 - buy it, m8!” Narrowing it down, I would have to say the main causes of me no longer approving this game are as follows:\nContent hidden behind paid DLC (That I would argue should not be needed)\nAbsolute destruction of the stealth game-play\nGrind so hard; Call me Tony Hawk\nDLC – Pay to play; Pay to win\nNow, I’m not putting it lightly when I say PD2 has DLC (As of this moment, it has 14 paid DLC packs, with 23 in total). Now, there is nothing wrong with producing additional content for your game, especially if that content is of high quality. The problem arises when you start attaching this content to brand new parts of the game and make it impossible to obtain it otherwise.\n\nFor example, multiple achievements require you and three friends each wearing a different mask from a set of four. Why would you have a system like that? Why make me either a) try to find three other people who have the DLC to play with me (which is actually quite difficult) or b) try to convince three of my friends to buy a DLC pack that they might not even want? The worst thing about this is that obtaining these achievements is the only way to access other content in the game, THAT IS STILL TIED TO THE DLC.\n\nSide note, why is it that with every new weapon pack that came out I found myself using less and less of the actual vanilla content? It got to the point where the only good weapons were ones that you had to pay for, and most people would rather not have to pay $5 for new weapons when there was not a lot wrong with the old ones to begin with.\n\nStealth – “Don’t forget to bring heavy armor”\nOh my, how the mighty have fallen! I remember always wanting to do stealth for pretty much everything. From Jewelry store, then Framing Frames, that one day on Firestarter. It was some of the most fun and most challenging experiences I have had with the game. Then things went funky (and not in a good way like this) and now stealth is a dying art.\n\nIncreased guard presence? I’m okay with that. Re-spawning guards? It’s a bit annoying but acceptable. It makes some sense, I guess. A guard will page for everything from being taken hostage to taking a dump? What the hell kind of pager operator do you have? Someone who’s telepathic? It is stuff like this that made stealth as viable as it is now: Barely. Near the end of my experience, I found myself wanting to gear up for stealth, but ending up looking more like everyone else in the crew: Armed to the teeth with the strongest weapons and armor money could buy… just so I could pick open a damn safe.\n\nIn regards to the pager complaint, I find it weird that when talking down a guard, the pager operator can hear everything and yet he only chooses to ask for conformation once the guard has been capped. If he could do this the whole time, why doesn't the PO hear gunshots and ask about that? Suppressors, even though they diminish the sound, are still loud enough that they can be distinguishable amongst other noises.\n\nIn regards to stealth compared to difficulty, I would agree that stealthing certain heists is indeed easier than going balls-deep. From what I remember, one of the big problems that occured with going loud was movement of the objective. You constantly had to stop moving the objective to a) cover a team-mate or b) hide so your cornhole isn't violated by a Bulldozer. With stealth, once the guards were gone, that was it. You waited to pick up your score then you were off. You could say that it is more boring this way, but realisticaly, you have just pulled off the perfect heist. No evidence of who you are or where you are going, you just did it.\n\nFor the stealth-only heist(s): When I quit, the only stealth-only heist available was Shadow Raid. I honestly had no problem with it. I thought that they had really captured the essence of silent game-play. Making it more about avoidance than domination.\n\nThe Grind – 180 Kick-flip = 543 points\nRemember that moment when you bought your first gun? That moment when you finally started on your own way to play? Wasn't it great? How about when you realized that you can’t do anything with your fancy new toy until you get the right mods for it? Probably not as great as when you first started. The endless grind of doing 50 heists just to get that one mod you REALLY want goes from fun to boring in a very short amount of time. Sure, when you get the mod and the money for it, it becomes a better experience. However, in the time between, it’s just tiring. Without the DLC or finding new ways to complete heists, you just burn out and it feels like what you are doing is more of a job than a game.\n\nConclusion:\nPayday 2 is a game where at one point I would have recommended it everyone, because that is just how much fun it was. Now, unless you got the friends, the money, and the time, you might be better off holding off on this purchase until you are sure that it is right for you. I don’t believe in a rating system beyond Approve/Disprove, so I will just end this here.\n\nThank you for reading, and have a nice day!","January 2, 2015","false","184.0"," 238 of 338 people (70%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","70","238","338","21","2"

It used to be something precious to me, but now I think I'll let it fade into memory. We used to feel as though the devs were friendly, honest workers who just wanted to give you a good damn game.  Instead you now have microtransactions for random number generated-loot safes, and a bunch of old DLC of dubious quality.\n\nI'll give you a good example of how broken the experience has felt. It was bad enough that the DLC weapons felt inconsistent, with entire weapon classes being nerfed, buffed and re-nerfed again and again, but some weapons they simply left in a state of dubious usage whilst certain weapons got buffed to the moon with their special DLC attachments. So in comes a new and improved weapon system that makes damage increases useless compared to accuracy and stability ones, and makes shotguns nearly worthless.\n\nStealth was broken from the get-go. You simply needed to kill four guards with certain skills, then dominate a fifth. Sometimes you'd have to survive with one guard, but that was fine. In comes a stealth update which adds more guards, promoting less of the murder. Great idea if it weren't for the AI, the map design and the inavoidable detection situations (see: Big Oil) making the stealthing experience all the more insufferable.\n\nThe only thing I can recommend this for is the gunplay, which is still pretty stellar. However, there doesn't seem to be much of a ceiling to it anymore. With perk decks being a perfect counterpart to the skill trees now, (despite the nerfs here and there) it feels as though the game can't be innovated upon much further, besides improving on the aged engine. Oh, and there's this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t idea that throwing more difficulty into the mix makes everything better.\n\nAn issue with the devs themselves is that they seem to have a few suits making strange decisions up top, like movie cash-ins and an initial reliance on getting actors to play the part of characters in a live action web-series. What's the point of paying Eric Etebari (besides paying him for just being gorgeous) if he's never going to be doing the voice acting? Derek Ray is never around to voice Houston, (who previously took the mantle of Hoxton, infuriating fans of the first game) Ulf Andersson has left the company and will no longer be voicing Wolf, and sure they get Damion Poitier in quite often, and we're very thankful they caved in and got Pete Gold in, giving us back one of the best characters they had, but they KEEP adding these characters and they KEEP adding more DLC and maps, leaving massive holes in the voice acting, lending a soulless feeling to a lot of games owing to the fact that they simply can't keep their releases polished.\n\nThey've done us some solids, they've also given us some turds. It feels like the game's development was entirely improvised and I think that shows now, more than ever. I just hope if there's ever a third game, the focus isn't on big movie tie-ins, inconsistent DLC releases, juvenile gunwank skins for microtransactions or a reliance on live action all coming together to ultimately slow the development process down. I think Overkill can see the ceiling, and although they have evidently jumped for it, they're often quite a bit more comfy in their chairs.","February 2","false","879.9"," 72 of 86 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","72","86","0","8"

After an IRS audit stemming from failure to report their gains from stealing mayan gold underneath the First World Bank, the Payday gang has been reduced to knocking down jewelry stores and running petty protection rackets in the DC/Metro area. However, the Unitesd States has passed a PATRIOT-like act that gives the FBI ability to respond to any crime, including armed robbery, extortion, jaywalking, and speeding. As such, the DC police force is completely willing to send dozens of officers to their death for $25,000. In addition, special ops units have been mobilized to be part of these FBI detachments, including units with titanium-laden riot shields that can take an inumerable amount of shots from the front, armed units with tazers providing incapacitating amounts of electricity, martial arts experts who are also part-time olympic runners who are put into tacticool suits, and a man in an EOD suit borrowed from the army. The FBI has also taken help from the 'Private Security Firm' Gensec, who is given a cut of the national budget, allowing them to field mercenaries in military gear and armor. Thankfully for the Payday gang, the position of 'bank guard' at GenSec does not require a high school degree, and as such pager operators do not realize that somebody completely different is talking on the other side of the line, at least until he's fallen for it four times. Now you must fight the man by stealing jewelry, breaking stuff, and stealing more stuff all across DC, all the while helping the gym bag industry.

I've got to V-100 (Max level, max prestige) legitimately. This game is decent but it has far too many problems.\n\nFirstly, playing with friends is a blast. Get together with 3 other people and rob a bank, diamond store, etc. Go in stealthily, silently take out guards in an empty corridor or just swagger in while putting a mask over your face and holding a shotgun. That stuff is great at first. If you're an experienced player and friends are new to the game -- Let them host the game and pick the missions. I see too many people catapulting their friends through the levels by doing max difficulty multi-day heists. A natural progression is much more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nOn to the problems:\n\n1) Stealth is broken.\n\nA core gameplay mechanic outright doesn't work. In order to stealth consistently you need to use light armour (or a suit) and low profile weapons. If the alarm gets raised, stealth is gone and you need to complete the mission "loud". Good luck taking out juggernauts in bomb disposal suits, and 100 assorted law enforcement personnel with your silenced handgun and a suit. It's not realisitically going to happen unless you're already ready to escape.\n\nSecondly, stealth is actually broken. Without talking about desync issues in MP (yet): guards will walk through walls, spot you through walls, spot a broken window through 4 walls whilst being at the other side of a building, etc. This breaks stealth and you need to complete the mission loud (as described above). There is no reason for it, it just happens. There is no counterplay or skill-based way of avoiding it, the game will decide at random intervals whether you fail the mission right then for no reason whatsoever.\n\nThirdly, for balance reasons you get a limited number of cable ties to take hostages. This stops them calling the cops, running away (alerting other civilians, etc).  You can also use an ECM jammer, a temporary device that stops people calling police and/or jams cameras. It gives you time to destroy cameras, take hostages, etc. It would be great if it worked consistently: Civilians are randomly able to trigger the alarm while it's up (it's not intended). Yet another feature of the game that will instantly fail a mission because of a bug.\n\nLastly, certain stealthable missions ('Big oil' being the main example) have broken hivemind AI. If one NPC sees you, every NPC in the map immediately becomes alerted and knows your exact position, will raise the alarm, etc. Stealth is a puzzle game with a little bit of RNG. Once you figure out how to stealth a mission, it's solved.\n\n2) MP is broken\n\nMultiplayer is broken in many, many ways. It's P2P (which I'm fine with for this format of game). There are random connection problems, sometimes a certain friend can't join you but you can join them; then another friend is able to join you but not them. Other times it will work just fine.\n\nPrivacy settings are broken. If you make a public lobby it's usually public, but not always. If you make a private lobby, it's sometimes public. "Friend-only" is Friends and friends-of-friends to the infinite degree (but only one at once). A friend can join you and while they are in the game, their friend "X" can join your games; the original friend is free to leave then. Then any friend of "X" can also join, and so on. Bottom line:  They are visibility settings, not restrictions. There are big problems with doing it that way.\n\nHackers are abundant. There are some very basic anti-cheat methods in the game. They don't actually stop people cheating, instead it marks that player as a cheater for everyone in the game. The cheating isn't so much of an issue -- you can host your own lobby if your connection is stable enough or you can just leave an find another lobby (or play with friends!). The bigger issue is 3rd party services (pd2stats) that will check your profile to see if you're cheating. No problem, apart from if you have a private profile on steam you'll be kicked from every public lobby. This is indirectly the fault of the game, the community has been driven to inaccurate methods of detecting people cheating because the game offers basically nothing. Not to mention that those sites will randomly mark you as a hacker for a variety of reasons. If you're max level, prepare to be kicked from every game too: people would rather just kick you than risk playing with a hacker.\n\nSync is broken. Physicals aren't synced, they're all client-side. This is espeically a problem with ragdolls. So enemy positions aren't synced but detection is done on the host. It leads to many things like getting spotted through a wall (NB: This can happen in SP because of a bug anyway). If you shoot a guard, he'll die where he actually is -- not for you though. So that guard who's in a corridor, but actually in the middle of room: Don't shoot him. He'll die in a room full of people and you'll fail. Of course you'll see the corpse in the corridor with no way for anyone to see them, but 3 other people in the game will shout at you for it. So you decide to wait an extra second or two to counteract it (taking into account you may got spotted too!) and you may think you've worked around the issue (nope!). Ragdolls are client-side: The body can ragdoll anywhere on the host and get the alarm triggered. Sometimes the physics can break and you can't answer the guard's pager (required!) and so you fail. That's a fourth distinct way of just failing a mission that's completely out of your control.\n\n3) Items are RNG, missions are a grind, difficulty increases\n\nSo you can buy guns, great! Oh, you need an RNG drop to unlock the silencer. When it comes to stealth or max difficulty missions, you need the right loadout from RNG drops. By max level (without prestige) you'll have almost everything you'll need for a lot of missions (But not the perfect gear).\n\nUnlocking skills costs money. You get money by doing missions (hurrah!) but you'll quickly find at lower levels that you level up faster than accumulating the required money to actually utilize your level. Don't think about unlocking guns at the same time either.\n\nThere aren't many different missions. There's quite a few at first, but many of them are pointless after a while. The "lower level" missions give very little EXP or money regardless of difficulty. They aren't much easier on the hardest difficulties compared to other missions and in some cases can take longer. It forces you into grinding the same missions over and over. The devs have done a decent job recently in balancing the amounts of EXP and cash earned but it's just not enough.\n\nNewer (DLC, free or paid) missions are more difficult than the previous missions. That's cool since it gives a new challenge. Oh? They improved the AI too! Cool. Wow, this is hard and I'm going to enjoy it when I finall-- wait, why is that guy mowing through everything it takes a whole clip to the face for me to kill it. "lol these new weapons are great" -- Weapons from paid DLC.\n\n4) Free content is "community DLC"\n\nIt's not "free DLC", it's "community DLC" which is free. All you need to do is to join the steam group for the game and you unlock it. New weapons, missions. It's cool until you disagree with a dev and they can decide to ban you from the group. GUIZE WE BAN HACKERZ ND DEY CNT GET FREE STUFFZ! (except of course, they can).\n\nClosing: I'm out of characters (there's a limit!). There are so many things broken about this game and I can't list them all. It's fun with friends but it's buggy in many ways. Devs blaming crashes on "mods" or hardware or software issues on your end doesn't help either.","December 25, 2014","false","300.1"," 426 of 628 people (68%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","68","426","628","26","18"

That was fine, it was a fairly responsible model and you got decent stuff for getting it and didn't get screwed over for not.\n\nThen they made microtransactions, which they had promised they would not do. The community was rightly angry at this, and even the forum moderators protested. Overkill, realizing that what they presumed was a personal atm was now provoked against them, released an apology. But this apology ignored the true problem, and did not retract the microtransactions. Overkill continued breaking its word, and demonstrated that they should not be trusted as a developer.

So much. It's been my go to weekend game with my friends for a while now and I think I've put in the time to prove it. We've bought all the DLC collectively and supported overkill through the past even when there were some more contraversial time such as with the completely overkill pack, which we all got as well.\n\nBut man this update ♥♥♥♥ed that up.\n\nOkay so here's the issue on the table. They've decided it would be an excellent idea to add tf2/CS:GO like skins to the game. Get your crates, get your keys, get your skins. That's all well and good except for two things.\n\n1. Overkill stated early into development that payday 2 would have no microtransactions.\nNow going back on their word in this way isn't the end of the world except that point number 2 is the real kicker.\n\n2. These skins actually affect the stats of weapons.\nOh boy. They've totally ♥♥♥♥ on balance now. Anybody could buy keys now and crates and get an item better than anybody who doesn't feel like paying microtransactions.\n\nThis could be remedied in two  ways as far as I'm concerned.\nThey could remove the stats on the weapons, or add a reasable way in game to earn keys. They could even do both.\nI personally think it would actually be a cool idea to make getting crates and keys only obtainable by methods in game myself, and leave the stats intact. No microtransactions involved. Reason being is that since I'm at the point where I'm comfortable with my build, have all the guns I want to use, etc. give me something that I can do with my time in game. Give me something to shoot for. Possibly get a slightly better accuracy stat on a gun that I like for example. That would be fine by me as along as it's VIA IN GAME METHODS ONLY.\n\nUntil any of this is fixed to some degree though, I won't be able to tell my friends how great a game is.\n\nBuyer beware, at least until they bother to fix this ♥♥♥♥.","October 15, 2015","false","617.5"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","48","50","0","0"

It's an awesome co-op experience which I never had in this way, it's a revolutionary game concept and very interesting. The level- and skills system is amazing and excites you to earn more money with heists. It contains a lot of action, they're four classes for every game style, so everyone should find a suitable character for himself. The way how the same map changes every round is nice, so it's not everytime the same thing, the cameras are changing the postion, the bank manager is leaving the bank from another side, it's not easy to learn the map by heart, so it's always challenging.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nSound: 10/10\n\nSoundtrack: 11/10 (It's Simon Viklund and his work is amazing so as in true Spinal Tap tradition but this one goes to 11) it's the first soundtrack from a game that I have actually really wanted.\n\nGame Mechanics: 9/10 (very solid FPS platform with RPG elements and the heist factor just so addictive; my only issue is how they count what is a "heist" which got over stated but still, having 12 heists at launch is fantastic. Stealth is also hard as hell but so much fun.)\n\nReplay value: 10/10 (You constantly replay heists but the dynamic layouts and the variability in difficulty, etc. make this game so very much worth replaying)\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone who likes heists and intensive, team-based co-op action.","June 24, 2014","true","481.0"," 108 of 142 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","108","142","2","4"

Payday 2 fails in being a better game than Payday 1. Ultimately the quality of the heists is what really kills this game for me.\n\n*see edits at the bottom as I wanted to keep the review in it's original form*\n\nPositives:\n+ Better Gunplay, the guns feel like real guns in this game. I much prefer Payday 2's gunplay over 1.\n+ Weapon customization, definitely a great addition.\n+ Stealth improvement, definitely better stealth elements when compared to the first game.**\n\nNegatives:\n- Completely uninspired heists that mostly rely on bag handling. This in turn reduces the usefulness of the vast majority of the skills in the game.\n- Unfinished game. No cloakers*, no safe house customization, and re-used maps that are considered separate heists by the dev team.\n- RPG system, while a slight improvement over the first game, the amount of grinding one has to do to level up here is worse than the first game. Most heists are useless after reaching around level 40. The first game had a similar amount of grinding, but each heist felt more balanced in experience.\n- Card drops, this has to be one of the worst additions to the game. Frustrating to all hell. Make the attachments just cost money directly and don't have the need to get the card first then pay to put it on the gun.\n- NO ORIGINAL HOXTON VOICE ACTOR ****\n-*** The asinine amount of money that almost everything costs. Want to put on an attachment on a gun? Well that'll be 300K, effectively several heists. Oh do you want to take it off and put it on another gun? 300K more please.\n\n\nTo sum it up succinctly, Payday 2 had the potential to be vastly superior to the first game in nearly every way, the devs however I think rushed to "complete" the game and really didn't test things out properly. The plethora of smash and grab heists only adds to my disappointment. Truthfully, I would like to see a Payday game that had the length and detail of the first game in terms of heists and the gunplay, weapon customization and stealth aspects of the second game.\n\n*Edit 2/12/2014: It's nice that they finally added cloakers after many months. The rest of the problems still stand.\n\n**Edit 2/28/2014: Goodness me, I didn't think it could get worse, but with the latest patch, they seemed to have nerfed stealth tremendously. They also punish people from playing the same heist over again, as if the grind isn't already awful with the Call of Duty style prestige system (I know it's technically infamous, but lets call it what it is.) I think ultimately, the developers really have stopped paying attention to the community and regreatably have ruined this game completely.\n\n***Edit 6/22/2014: After taking a long break from playing this game, I returned to it and played all the missing DLC missions up to and including the new 7$ DLC. Suffice to say many of the things I gripe about in the above review still hold true. While the heist for the new 7$ DLC is something I would categorize as "good," the vast majority of the missions are still very mediocre, stealth mechanics still suck, the grind is god awful, and not having the ability to play whatever mission you want is highly annoying. After being out for 10 months, I would still not recommend this game to anyone, even on sale. The plethora of paid DLC that basically amount to micro-transactions coupled with the broken game economy really tells the whole tale of the game, one that was crafted to make people buy DLC to get more of the full game and for them to spend hours grinding. I also find it rather pitiful that one has to pay 7$ to get the quality of 1 heist that was essentially what Payday 2 should have been full of. If you want to play a heist game, Payday 1 is something that I would recommend, a game that has character, great missions, and a grind system that doesn't suck.\n\n**** Final Edit 11/14/2014: I've played this game since my last edit, where several additional DLC packs were released and a new heist, and the John Whick character. The Hoxton Breakout Heist is probably one of the worst heists in this game. I didn't feel like it was a breakout at all, and the polish on this heist felt very poor. Yes it was a free heist, but I find little point as it was such a terrible attempt at what could have been the best heist of the game. Honestly this point after a year+ of this game, the asinine amounts of DLC and no great heists besides the 8$ Bank Heist, I cannot recommend this game in any sense. I had pre-ordered Payday 2, the career criminal edition and ultimately I find much regret in that decision. Overkill has dissapointed me with their design decisions and never really reaching the quality of the first game. I will be very cautious of buying any Overkill game in the future, and certainly will not pre-order anything from them until they turn around their game design decisions.","December 25, 2013","false","47.9"," 607 of 918 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","607","918","0","14"

Here's why:\n\n1. Nerfing exp gain from missions that players found to be more efficient to "farm" for experience points\n\n2. The constant "push" towards a more action-packed game instead of a stealth adventure\n*This game has stealth as an option, but stealth as a whole is being constantly nerfed\n\n3. The combination of both free DLC AND paid DLC\n*Why can't it all be free?\n\n4. Making the game last longer by adding in artificial grind instead of more new heists\n*A couple patches ago the devs introduced a new mechanic called "Infamy", which essentially raises the level cap (yes, this game has levels like an RPG) from 100 to 500. Best of all, they even said they haven't finished the system yet, because they're still deciding on what benefits to give levels past 501 before they put it in!\n\n5. Adding in respawning guards just to mess with stealth players more\n\nDevs need to understand that this is the ONLY co-op heist FPS on the market with stealth elements and play it to its strengths. Stop nerfing things, make both stealth and action equally viable, and stop adding in artificial grind. Until then, I cannot recommend this game at all and ashamed at what it has become.

P2w was a problem, but it wasn't THE problem. PAYDAY 2 had already begun introducing p2w in its very first DLC. The real problem was that Overkill Software built itself a powder keg, sat on it, lit the fuse, and then tried to put out the fuse with gasoline.\n\nDon't think that this was an isolated failure. Overkill dragged their feet on fixing simple issues that the scripting community had fixed for months. They did more blatant cashgrabbing over time with promotional content and gimmick DLCs sold at $5 or $7 each. They ran an event that explicitly tied purchases of PAYDAY 2 DLC to later rewards. They paid practically no attention to weapon balance (and considering what they did later, it was better off without their attention at all). They ignored fair play between DLC/non-DLC users for the longest time. They hyped up new a enemy twice, and gave us something stationary and tedious to fight both times.\n\nThis pileup of cash-grabbing, misplaced priorities, and general incompetence had become too big for them to simply placate the fans with more free content. That's our keg.\n\nFlash to mid-October 2015. The second annual Crimefest event. PAYDAY fanatics had been grinding out in-game milestones for the past half-month to unlock rewards for Crimefest. The reward descriptions were cryptic to the point of irrelevance, so speculation had been running wild for weeks. You know what Overkill gave us for the first day of Crimefest?\n\nUgly skins with stat bonuses and a comical failure of a weapon "rebalance". The subreddit lit up like a Christmas tree, but the disaster didn't stop there. The "damage control" over the fan outrage made it very obvious that the leadership at Overkill was completely out of tune with the fans, like an old man trying to do gangsta rap to fit in with a tournament of nerds. This is where the constant mockery over broken promises and "the numbers show that players are loving it" came from.\n\nThe later Crimefest and post-Crimefest content patched over some of the issues or were good in their own right, but the damage had already been done. The subreddit's top posts are filled with backlash, game went from 90% to 75% in Steam reviews out of 180k reviews, and a lot of the old guard left for greener pastures.\n\nYou probably didn't need a post half as long as this, but I felt I had to say something because I'm one of those butthurt PAYDAY veterans (2348 hours) and I can't stop picking at the incredible stupidity like it's an itchy scab. ♥♥♥♥ like this deserves to be told and mocked for all of eternity.\n\nMy personal response to this:\nAs much as I loved the game, I simply can not recommend this to anyone anymore.","January 15","false","187.6"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","57","66","0","2"

How the hell do you justify this in any way? These don't fit the game at all. Might I add that having to pay money for another drill to open a safe, of which if you go to the still non-customizable safehouse, is in the garage? Oh wait, this one isn't painted somewhat. Can't be used! Isn't this fun!?\n\nOverkill, nobody, literally, nobody, thought "I wish Payday 2 had an economy!" The most we EVER wanted to the ability to trade masks and weapons to other people, especially if we could sell it for in-game money. Instead you took the more Corporation approach, removed the fun aspect of this, then had real money involved, and from there, it was all downhill.\n\nWait, how is this free, and how is this obtainable to everyone?Now, the next problem, is that this is supposed to be a free update. As in, everyone will be getting this and have a chance to get it, for free. As in, no DLC, nor Microtransactions.\nRight out of the gate, they add TF:GO, something no one liked, nor wanted in TF2.\n\nEven better, the other part of this update introduced weapon rebalancing, which they did poorly, but it's worse when you realize that this was the only other part of this update. So, you mean to tell me you had more interest in making money than our interests!? What are you, a modern day gaming company!? What do you mean you only see me as a friend!?\n\nMay I remind you that Crimefest is a Community Driven series of free Updates?\nAs in, we worked for this? This was supposed to be stuff the community wanted? And immedietly, right out of the gate, they want to shove more ways to milk this game, and tell us "You wanted this! You worked for this!" with no explaination as to why you decided to use this update for more ways to milk me dry of money?\n\nWhat a way to start, hey, wanna start the next crimefest by canceling Firefly Season 2? Because now I'm disinterested in your games/Crimefest. You figuratively took a ♥♥♥♥ inside my computer to start this crimefest, you burned down my childhood home with my childhood dog in front of me to start this crimefest. You ran over my grandma with reindeer to start this Crimefest. And you KNEW, this was going to happen. Isn't that like going to a person who just won the lottery then kicking them in the ♥♥♥♥, them falling over, then proceeding to kick them in the ♥♥♥♥ some more? Then stealing that ticket.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, we're all pretty much not in the mood for Crimefest anymore, and honestly, would prefer if it was cancelled, this update to be modified/removed, then you never touch the game again. If this is the direction of not only the game, but the Community Driven Free Update "Crimefest", where they really aren't free, and our efforts were for not, and they're only there to benefit you, then I'd prefer if you never touched the game again.\nThe game is fine on it's own, just let it live on it's own now without ripping it's utters off. You don't need to work on it for another 2 years either.\n\nOh and if you're a completionist, now you're going to have to pay out of pocket, for a game that doesn't need this cashgrab that no one wanted, in order to 100% it.\n\nLet's be honest here...Overkill, we sat through your artificially raised pricing for your buggy/lackluster DLC because we trusted you, and we wanted to ignore that blatant fact and enjoy the game.\nIn order to get the full experience, you need to pay over 120$ mind you there is no Season Pass of any kind. Of which is sort've a thing for people like Overkill who can't help but premature eject 5$-7$ DLC every month.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, we were willing to look past the bugs, look past the milking, look past the artificially high pricing, and trust you had our interests in mind.\nNow though, we don't need to look past it, and we have no reason to keep lying to ourselves and others. We don't see you as "buddy-buddy" anymore.\nPayday 2 is mediocre. The Free updates you release, are mediocre, the DLC you release, is pretty much the same situation. Except with artifically high pricing.\n\nAnd let's be honest, that's the truth. We denied it for you Overkill. But once again, you show your abusive Spouse side and make us lose that trust. Once again.\n\n\nIs there something more to this?Think about it, PD2 is going to be F2P for 10 days, but first they added Microtransactions like in TF:GO? Is this supposed to be manipulation? No doubt, people are going to either assume they own the game now, and think "I should buy some skins, they're only 2-3$" Then come to realize that they don't own the game. Even if that's not the case, it's a completely real fact that this is manipulation of the uninformed.\n\nSince it's "normal" for F2P games to have microtransactions, they're going to blindly accept this ♥♥♥♥, without realizing they're going to need to pay for it later. And if they don't, it's even worse since that's even harsher manipulation.\n\nOne side note, Goonmod was already capable of making skins for your gun, just like you would for your masks. And you could make some pretty good ♥♥♥♥ with this. Now, BLT and Lua don't work. Hmm? That's annoying. The only way to get my skins now is to go get Overkill's mostly 2 Tone skin with a single logo slapped everywhere. Or even better, a skin that's literally 1 texture. Yeah that's totally worth my time and money.\n\nCompared to what I've made, these skins are like a kid used the gradient tool in Paint.net\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=489631915\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484199053\n\n\nUnoriginality makes the bandwagon go round.I'd also like to point out, that these Microtransactions are legit, becoming a thing now. As in, they are going to be apart of this dying gaming industry. The newest Tomb Raider game will have over 300 Micros, and there's a few more that will as well.\n\nOnce again, Overkill, decided to childishly, with no regard for anyone else but themselves, add this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because they didn't want to be original. They want to jump on a bandwagon because it makes everyone money. What they didn't calculate, is that they don't have the rep Valve undeservingly does, they can't get away with this. Because now, we're not accepting mediocrity. You haven't done ♥♥♥♥ to deserve anyone's trust, nor did you in the first place, here's looking at you Safehouse customization.\n\nYou think your game is worth 120$ + Micros? Well then, prepare for it to be ♥♥♥♥ on, since no one agrees with you. Your game is still buggy and unoptimized, mostly due to the terrible choice of an Engine. You pull the same tactic as every other company, where you basically sell "The other half of the game" DLC. Then you spit on the face of everyone who worked for this free series update, that we seldom get, let alone, seldom get anything higher than 5/10 quality. And you thought this was a good idea to start with? It wasn't. I'm not buying, nor play any of your games anymore. Even if this update is removed, I honestly, don't care. You offered me nothing for years, then proceed to offer me even less.","October 15, 2015","false","538.4"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","44","46","0","0"

That in my opinion does make this game pay to win. "A game you buy being pay to win? HOW ABSURD" you might think. However it's the sad truth. A game where it's focused on PVE entirely is pay to win. The second you can have an advantage in a game with weapons that are stronger than the ones you currently have in-game? Sure it's not TOO bad but this makes harder heists easier to escape if you, and all your friends are running around with purchased weapon packs, that are modded to hell. You can make the basic guns just as good, sure that's arguable. However doesn't change the fact these guns are better in almost every way. Please, if you're thinking of buying this game you're better off buying Payday 1.","April 10","false","207.2"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","65","79","4","0"

It was a game that revolved around performing heists, either loud or stealth, usually by choice, whilst influenced, heavily, by co-op and team-play. It used to be updated regularly with content, most of it paid, which was alright at the time. It even introduced two new dificulty-changing mechanics in fear the players would get bored of the game. Both the Cloaker enemy and the Deathwish update. It also provided us with an infamy update which, in itself, should keep players playing the game more, and give them a goal after the final level 100. It had, and has still, excellent weapon customization, it has it's fair share of masks and as of late, quite a few characters to choose from.\nAnd this is where the bad stuff comes in.\nPAYDAY2 is not so much of a game anymore, rather than an advertisement. There are three types of characters. The main five you get for free, the ones you pay for, and the ones they're paid to introduce. Yes, PAYDAY2 introduces characters based on movies, whilst advertising those movies, in a way that's not even subtle. By featuring their trailers whenever you start the game. "Free content" my ♥♥♥♥. Well it doesn't stop there. Most games settle for a few expansion packs and DLCs. Which is understandable because some companies need a certain ammount of money to stay running and not shut down. The thing is none of those companies have TWO HOUNDRED ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLARS OF DLC! Well, excluding the stupidity that is Train Simulator. But that's a story for another day.\n\nNow here's the part where it gets interesting!\n\nApparently, 200$ in DLC wasn't enough. And new content is hard to come up with. Overkill needed a fast, and easy way to make money, with zero to no effort. How did they do it, you ask? Easy! They disabled support for most mods and skins,  went into third party mod hosting websites, downloaded user skins, implemented into the game without credditing ANYONE, and locked them away in safes! How to open the safes? With drills from the steam market!\nThe MORONS, as there is no other term of refering to Overkill as, have LITERALLY, but QUITE LITERALLY copied the CS:GO/TF2:GM code, as in, safe unboxing, roulette, skin wear and tear and color quality, aswell as weapon inspection, into PAYDAY2! And again, IT'S NOT EVEN SUBTLE! The same roulette! The same weapon inspection animations! Some of these skins even look the same! Now, you think it's not that bad, that the game is trying to base itself off of more successfull games such as CS:GO and TF2, right? Well neither CS:GO and TF2 have 200$ worth in ♥♥♥♥ing DLC, and none of them cost a ♥♥♥♥ing 20$ in the steam store. PLUS, These games have a competitive factor, and are exclusively PVP! PAYDAY 2 is a CO-OP PVE GAME!\n\nTo recap, is PAYDAY2 a good game? Was. Before it became an add and a machine that milks the fans who use daddy's money every month and have no ♥♥♥♥ing priorities.\nIs it STILL a good game? As of the implementation of microtransactions, which Overkill promissed THRICE NOT TO IMPLEMENT, having the AUDACITY, mind you, to one of those times say "SHAME ON YOU IF YOU THOUGHT OTHERWISE"? No. It's not a good game anymore.\n\nRest in peace PAYDAY2.\n\nThanks for reading if you even made it this far.\n\nHave a good day.\n\n\n\nOh, and the skins, by the way, add stat bonuses to the weapons. I don't know how making a P90 bright neon ♥♥♥♥in' green adds more accuracy, but I'm sure there's a logical explenation, right?\n\n\n\n[Edit] Did I mention Overkill submited an apology? But they're still releasing new safes and skins almost monthly, so their apology is pretty much void!","May 22","false","726.6"," 217 of 317 people (68%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","68","217","317","14","38"

And by a lot I mean about 1800 hours, so I would say I know a lot about the game. I really loved this game when it was in it's early stages, from 2013 all the way up to just a couple of days ago. It really was a great game. Fun to play with friends and downloadable content that was absolutely unnecessary to buy and were basically just side grades to the vanilla weapons.\n\nUnfortunately, Payday 2's DLC had been going through what people like to call "power creep", which basically means that the developers made it so that guns that you buy were just slightly better than the previous weapon you had, and eventually the power creep is very easily shown by the stat difference in weapons.\n\nWith OVERKILL's newest update called Crimefest (which was said by the devs to be ten days of FREE content for the community), I was completely shocked. A new system of "safes" that contained weapon skins was released in the game. The catch? You can only open the safes with REAL MONEY, similar to the systems in both Team Fortress 2, and Counter Strike - Global Offensive. Now the real problem with this model for Payday 2, is that it is not a cheap game and the DLC is expensive. TF2 is free to play (so the micro transactions are acceptable), and CS:GO is relatively cheap with no DLC available. However, in both of these games, the microtransactions are COMPLETELY cosmetic, and Payday 2's skins offer stat boosts to the weapons, which threw around the Pay-to-win concepts.\n\nI am uninstalling this game, because the developers of the game can NOT be trusted, they only want money from us, and I will be HAPPY to leave this game behind.

You are the perfect example of the quote: “You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” I rarely pre-purchase any games, but I gladly pre-purchased Career Criminal Edition and to be clear - I don't regret it at all. It was great game at the beginning. True to its core, it had better game mechanics than the first game, absolutely amazing soundtrack, and very fun gameplay. Sure, it had problems and it was far from perfect, but it was highly playable and so much fun.\n\nThen it started with Armored Transport DLC. I got it for free, because I had Career Criminal Edition, so it seemed alright. Then it was followed by Gage Weapon Pack #01. Paying 5€ for few guns and grenades that should probably be available for everybody? I waited for sale because it didn’t seem worth it to me even back in 2013. Then we got Merry Payday Christmas Soundtrack DLC which was absolutely fantastic. Extremely cheap Payday 2 Christmas carols sang by old Hoxton. And then the hell began with insane flood of 5€ DLC weapon packs, 5€ character packs and 7€ heists. I’m warning you, the huge rant incoming!\n\nI have to say that I surely don't have any problem with more content; I understand that it’s keeping the game alive and I don't have the problem with paying for it. However, DLCs are rarely worth the full price. Look, it's nice you're supporting developers, but we are not charity, we are customers and I'm not paying 5€ for few weapons and masks when I can get the whole games in sale for the same price. Actually, I bought Vanishing of Ethan Carter for less than 5€ the day when Gage Chivalry Pack was released. Can you seriously tell me with straight face that Gage Chivalry Pack is offering me the same level of quality like Vanishing of Ethan Carter? Anyway, I said few weapons - weapon packs also usually include materials and patterns, but let’s be honest here – nobody cares about them and it’s there just to make it look like you’re getting more stuff.\n\nAt the current state, the game has 27 paid DLCs. If your eyes skipped the number, I will say it again: TWENTY SEVEN PAID DLCS! Before some genius will come here to defend Overkill with the argument that Borderlands 2 or Saints Row games have more DLCs, so they can’t see the problem, then, my friends, first of all, those games have Season Passes which is something that Payday 2 doesn’t have, second – most of the DLCs in Borderlands 2 are purely cosmetic on the same level like mask patterns in Payday 2, third – and my favorite - at the time of writing this review, both Saints Rows 3 and 4 have less DLCs than Payday 2. Actually, at the time of writing this, you can buy Saints Row IV: Game of the Century Edition (including all DLCs) for 5,99€. Can you see the difference?\n\nTo be honest, we got some free updates as well - usually maps or some significant game updates. And you know what? They were usually very cool. And free heists like Hoxton Breakout are absolutely brilliant!\n\nLet’s talk about more problems, like developer’s approach. 2014 was memorable for Crimefest which was pretty cool, but some awards from it took more than over a year to get which is ludicrous. To give you some example - let’s talk about the new enemy. Overkill claimed that the enemy was taking a lot of time because he had complicated voice acting. In the meantime they managed to release: Gage Historical Pack, Clover Character Pack, The Bomb Heists, Dragan Character Pack, The OVERKILL Pack, The Completely OVERKILL Pack (we will talk about it later), The Butcher’s AK/CAR Mod Pack, The Butcher’s BBQ Pack, The Butcher’s Western Pack, The OVERKILL B-Sides Soundtrack, The Alesso Heist, The Golden Grin Casino Heist, Sokol Character Pack, Gage Ninja Pack, Yakuza Character Pack and Gage Chivalry Pack. Obviously, the voice acting was the huge problem. Btw check this - http://payday.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Winters/Quotes . Does this really take a year?\n\nContinue time. Their PR is absolute mess. Perfect example is hilarious fiasco with Disappointment Bat when Overkill teased the community for 35 days to give it the bat and the announcement of their new game. Another pure insanity was Hype Train, which was something like Crimefest, but instead of being fueled by number of the people in the group, it was fueled by the people buying DLCs. See the problem here? It also introduced OVERKILL Pack DLC and Completely OVERKILL Pack DLC which was for 20€ and included 4 masks. You read right. 20€ FOR 4 MASKS. Oh and one surprise bonus that nobody still knows anything about! Before you defend Overkill that Completely OVERKILL Pack was meant to be the support DLC and to be a donation - do you really think that studio that acquired the Valhalla engine for 8,6 million dollars needs to beg for money like that implying that the game and 16 (back then) DLCs were not enough to fund their studio? Anyway, the Hype Train also included rushed Infamy Update which didn’t bring anything new, because it just changed the number of infamies from 5 to 25 while not giving any bonuses except for more XP bonuses so you can level up quicker. It was obviously rushed because community was very angry with Hype Train and it was meant to make Overkill look like it listens to the community feedback. After this horrible update, Overkill said that it listened to the community again and it would eventually remake the new infamy. That was few months ago and nothing really happened since then, so we can just forget that. Like the ability to upgrade the safe house. I know it’s just the running joke now, but they promised it in 2013. It’s 2015 and it’s still not here. They said it was coming in 2016, so I can't wait to see how 3 years of developing of safehouse upgrading will look like.\n\nI think that Overkill is just pushing and pushing and pushing to see what they can get away with. Year 2015 was just a mess of new characters who have no connection to the Payday universe and nobody really cares about combined with lazy or ridiculous gun packs that don’t fit the game at all, which is of course subjective, but I don’t think that (for example) swords really fit with the modern heisting game, unless of course you’re the part of LOL SU RANDUM crowd that will buy 5€ DLC, make a le funi 69/420 review and never touch it again. DLCs went so far I just refused to buy anything new from Overkill this year. By the way, I think that Gage Chivalry Pack took the biggest ♥♥♥♥ this year with reskins and weapons clearly out of place, with visual bugs in trailer and by being paid (of course) while other games like Killing Floor 2 who collaborated with Chivalry offered Chivalry stuff for free. Only Payday 2 NEEDED paid Chivalry stuff, because Overkill is the small indie company and they have to survive somehow, am I not right?\n\nYou see, no matter how poor content is, Overkill is always hiding behind the excuse that they are the small indie company. Even if true, it doesn’t make it okay for them to release lazy, ♥♥♥♥ poor content.\n\nSo anyway, we waited for another Crimefest. I thought: “Well, it should be alright, it’s not like they can do anything more ludicrous than Hype Train, right? That would be quite a feat!” and... they pulled it off. The second Crimefest managed to bring microtransactions into the game on its first day. Yes, you have the game you pay for with 27 paid DLCs with microtransactions. It’s like CS:GO, but you have safes instead of crates and drills instead of keys. Oh and by the way, drill will cost you 2,19€. If you open the safe with your drill, you get some skin that will change your weapon stats, so it’s not actually like CS:GO at all, because skins in CS:GO are just cosmetic unlike here. Oh and weapon skins look like some 12 years old made them.\n\nSo you probably know what I'm suggesting to you - don't bother with buying this game. Not worth it anymore.","October 16, 2015","false","695.4"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","42","44","0","0"

I played and played and focused on the positives, but in the end, it's not a very good game. None of the grandeur of Payday showed up in the sequel, and though the graphics are better, and the skill trees adds some fun features, what made Payday great was the cinematic stages that kept you moving from objective to objective. Payday 2 almost always descends into Killing Floor style holding out, and Killing Floor does it better. The 'tons of guns' available are mostly useless, which means you'll be using the same load out over and over again, there isn't much variety of enemies, and almost no variation between playthroughs of each mission. Add this to the microscopic maps you're playing on, and the whole thing gets pretty stale fast.\n\nAnd, let's be honest, the way they're rolling out DLC is just slimey. This is a game that turned a profit during pre-orders; there is no excuse to keep charging us for content that should have been included in the finished game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/traceeee/recommended/218620/","traceeee","Trace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/traceeee/","213 products in account","Being a person who enjoys casual games, I found Payday 2 to be a little challenging and sometimes, dry even. Despite this, I poured countless hours into it, doing heists with my friends and other players both locally and worldwide, as I enjoy the co-operative system of the game, as well as the coordination and interaction with other players.\n\nWith the Death Wish (27 Feb 2014) and infamy (22nd Jan 2014) update, I found the game to be more enjoyable, relishing in the four skulls heists and overcoming extremely challenging hurdles with my pals. The infamy update also gives me more incentives to continue playing the rather stale and limited number of heists. I must say the update was rather pivotal in me spending even more time in the game.\n\nWith the free addition of Election Day (20 Mar 2014) and Shadow Raid (29 May 2014), once again, being a big fan of stealth, I loved this addition, allowing me to enjoy the stealthy approach this game has to offer. I have to point out here that Shadow Raid is one of my favourite heist, being highly challenging as it requires full stealth as a timer will trigger when you alert the guards.\n\nBig Bank (17 June 2014) was a paid update that I had enjoyed and bought, as it was the first contract given by a new contact, The Dentist. It was a really engaging update and fun heist, Once again, the developers have proven themselves to be skillful enough to come up with an update that breathe fresh air into a game that was starting to get a little monotonous. I appreciated the intricate and elaborate setup of this heist, which introduced preplanning, a new feature which greatly impacted most of the heists today and changed the way heisters approached certain heists. An example would be the normal Bank Heists, where now we could place keycards and other items (body bags) to aid us in our taking of the Harvest and Trustee financial institution.\n\nHotline Miami Heist (30 Sep 2014) is once again, a job well done (might be due to it being a paid DLC), as it introduced the first VIP (The Commissar) whom we had to kill in the midst of the heist. The tasks within the heists were engaging and the soundtrack was definitely one of my favourite. Both challenging and engaging, this heist once again gave the game, at that point of time, a little push to keep it competitive in terms of its sales.\n\nFirst Crimefest (16 - 27 Aug 2014) was a great moment for us Heisters, as it showed how popular and great the payday community was, in terms of the developers' support for the game as well as the passion we heisters have for the game. It was sort of a celebratory victory for us making it so far as a community.\n\nJohn Wick (22 Oct 2014) the free character pack was released in promotion of the movie John Wick, which was released in theatres. From this update, I sensed a forboding of Payday 2 possibly being a tool of adverting, and man was I right. Subsequently, Hotline Miami 2 - Jacket (10 Mar 2015) and The Alesso Heists (21 May). both were blatant advertising tools mean to be targeted towards us in hopes of us buying the HM and HM2 game as well as supporting Alesso and his album on iTunes or something. There were also other collaborations with other game studios, resulting in tons of items like the Lucille Baseball Bat, various DLCs in collab with other games like Battlefield and Chivalry, and masks requiring the purchase of the Hotline Miami franchise, Speedrunners, various Humble Bundles. The most insane "collaboration", in my opinion, was the Alienware Alpha mask, requiring the purchase of the Alienware Alpha console. For the record, the console costs close to S$1,000 (USD$ 721) in my country.\n\nThe Old Hoxton and Hoxton Breakout (27 Oct) was another free community update that continues the story of the imprisoned Hoxton. It gives us the backstory of the Payday Crew, which I felt was very interesting. it had once again given us an engaging heist and a new character WITH A NEW SKILL TREE. This update changed the way some players played the game with the addition of the Fugitive skill tree. The Fugitive skill tree in conjuction with the Akimbo perk deck, makes for a rather gimmicky (in my opinion) playstyle, befitting that of a player who is tired of the conventional playstyle and wants to try a new way of clearing cop waves and especially cloakers (because HEADSHOT BONUS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!) with dual-wield pistols.\n\nWhite Xmas (4 Dec 2014) was a rather plain update to celebrate Christmas. Monotonous and a neverending heist, this was a rather dry period for the Payday community.\n\nThe next big change that brought the game back from its half-dead state was the Diamond Heist, Clover character pack (16 Dec 2014) and the Bomb Heists + Dragan Character update (22 Jan 2015). It gave the game two new paid heists which can be completed in both stealth and with guns blazing, and also two new characters (which I feel did not impact the game as much). I like the bomb heists as it reminded me of the Election Day heist, and also the open nature of the map. It gives players more freedom to tackle the heist in whichever way they feel comfortable with. That is a plus point. The Clover and Dragan character were rather refreshing and useful, with Clover being the first female heister and a rather competitive accompanying rifle and Dragan possessing a useful perk deck that isn't half bad in game.\n\nInfamy 2.0 (5 Mar 2015) was (in my opinion, again) the start of the decline of the game's popularity. It gave me the impression that the game had run out of juice and in order to keep a community of players intact, the developers decided to implement a short term "grind and grind" strategy to keep players around for a little longer. With the addition of infamy levels all the way up to Level XXV (25), and a ton of new infamy masks, which I felt looked pretty amazing. However, like I mentioned, this was a short term strategy to "keep players around before 'I' attempt to come up with more idead to spice up the game and hopefully make some profit!".\n\n\nSpring Break 2015 (Cook Off, Train Heist, Side Jobs feature, Bonnie Character, SWAT Turret, Hoxton Revenge and Car Shop) (13 - 21 Mar 2015) In all honesty, I felt that this update was pretty good. It gave us 3 new heists (Cook Off, Hoxton's Revenge, Car Shop) and a new 2nd female character (Bonnie), plus improvements to the game in terms of mechanics (SWAT Turret), as well as additional features to make the game more appealing, with incentives to make you replay the game (Side Jobs and individual Train Heist option). These were all done and released for free from Overkill.\n\nWith the new XP system and free Meltdown Heist (7 May 2015), it made significant changes to the heists' XP system, which allows you to level rush to infamy 25 real quick. It beefed up the XP gains for many heists and the payouts were also more generous. As a sweetener, the Meltdown Heist was also added to sweeten the long grind towards infamy. Well, by this point, anyone with a clear mind would be quitting the game by now. Me and my friends did during this period too. We did not feel like grinding all the way up. I am sure most of the community would agree with us.\n\nThe Golden Grin Casino Heist and Sokol Character (25 June) paid update introduced a new heist and a character called Sokol, which I felt was rather useful in terms of gameplay. His skill set complimented the other 4 skill trees and provided a good boost in terms of team work cop clearing potential. The Golden Grin Casino was at best, mediocre. A washed up and overused comcept in an attempt to bring back a game from the clutches of the deceased. This period was where I decided to check out the new stuff released and well, was I disappointed.\n\nYakuza - Jiro Character (27 Aug) was, what I felt, a buffer between the Golden Grin and the upcoming FBI files update. It did not seem very engaging or refreshing. Another overused concept of releasing a character with no great advantages.","October 17, 2015","false","196.7"," 95 of 128 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","95","128","3","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/necrobiologist/recommended/218620/","necrobiologist","RadioactiveCorgi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/necrobiologist/","208 products in account","I've been playing Payday 2 since the closed beta, and my god I don't know what to say about the game now. I still return from time-to-time to play some of the new maps and mess around with friends, but since the Microtransaction-gate uproar that surrounded the Safe and Drill update the game simply does not feel the same.\n\nThe mechanics are simple enough: four heisters, a ton of loot, and you have to get it all. The game isn't lacking in creative endeavours to break up a simple monotony; skydiving, goat-looting, car driving, counterfeiting... by all means it should be a rousing good time.\n\nHerein the problem lies: the community is practically nonexistant as of my writing this.\n\nBefore Safe-gate and all the subsequent updates, I could easily jump into a pub game, and while not perfect, for the most part you'd find helpful and knowledgeable teammates that would run through a few heists with you. The preferred method would be with friends only and an open Discord or Skype call. Still, despite the rough patches it was decent enough and you were guaranteed at least a good 2/3rds of your matches would end with a getaway and everyone getting some nice loot.\n\nNow, however, the game's fun and cooperative nature seems to have dried up as most of the veteran heisters have long abandoned Payday over their inclusion of microtransactions as well as a percieved pay-2-win scheme. While the latter is not true, the former sadly is, and it has drained this game of the life it had before. It saddens me to see such a great game brought to its knees by a single boneheaded move that Overkill refuses to undo or compromise on. They made a token gesture in the form of allowing drills to drop in the after-match cards, but the fact that the loot tables are now even more skewed with the addition of safes and drills makes it feel more like a backhanded "sorry".\n\nOverall, there was once a time I would have recommended the game with no reservations. It was fun, even better with friends, and there was a sense that Overkill cared about the userbase (except for the glut of redundant melee weapons, but that was fine). Even all the DLC was excuseable, seeing as none of it was absolutely necessary for the enjoyment of the base product save for one or two DLCs. Now, though, I have to say that unless you really love the concept of heisting and have a dedicated few friends to play with, the PUG scene is full of hackers and newbies, and very few people who play the game consistently.\n\nVERDICT: Wait for a sale, and be sure to have friends. This game is no longer fun in pick-up games and the amount of DLC and microtransactions is sure to sour your appetite if you go all-in when its full price.","March 1","false","450.0"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","48","55","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vulf/recommended/218620/","Vulf","Vulf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vulf/","298 products in account","I'm getting real tired of seeing reviews with people saying "This used to be a great game". Payday 2 was never a great game. It was never even an acceptable game.\n\nFrom its constant desync, to endlessly recycled maps with minor changes in objectives and slow updates (Both from Overkill and the community modders), to its horrendous playerbase of unreliable, half-blind fools with no reflexes or sense of awareness, to its never-ending flood of overpriced DLC that you MUST buy, unless you want 75% of the games content to be locked out for you. This game was rubbish from day one. It had potential, sure, but it never lived up to it. Overkill showed us what path they were going to take with this game pretty early in its life and they never tried to hide it.\n\nThese microtransactions are bad, yes. People are hurt about the broken promises and I completely understand why this is the breaking point for a lot of people. Personally I couldn't care less about those stat bonuses on skins, because you already have to pay more than what the game is worth, in DLC packs, just to keep up with other players anyway. The game always has been "Pay to win". But my father always taught me that you don't break your word to someone. If you make a promise to somebody, you keep it. Overkill are on record as having said at least 3 or 4 times that they would never add microtransactions to PD2, one time even saying "Shame on you if you thought otherwise", but they didn't keep their word. I don't know how things are in Sweden, but I can safely say that in most places on Earth, your word, your promise about something, means a lot, and if you break a promise to somebody they are going to be upset. Now, combine that with how upset the PD2 community already was about the DLC releases. Every time one was released, the PD2 Steam Group would get bogged down with angry comments and spam from people who clearly have been very unhappy with Overkill for a long, long time. Payday 2 is down to... what, 3.5/10 on Metacritic? This is what happens when you break promises, keep brushing aside community complaints and adding new systems people don't want. I call it “Star Wars Galaxies Syndrome”.\n\nI realize the game was different to other shooters, and it still is somewhat unique, but that doesn't make it a good game. It was built on an unstable base, and it has been falling apart for a long time now. Personally, I gave up on the game back with the Hypetrain event. Do you remember that? When Overkill promised that we'd all get free content if we BOUGHT ENOUGH DLC DURING THE EVENT? Including a $20 DLC pack that was released just for that event! Don't forget all the masks that don't cover your face anymore, the particle effects Ala TF2, the Overkill pack adding a Minigun and an RPG-7, and even a mission to steal nuclear weapons to sell to terrorists. The sense of being a classy bank robber, a James Bond turned evil character, is long dead in favour of the sense of being a low-moral terrorist. That was the moment the game died for me and my only regret is that some people still don't see how bad the game was before these microtransactions were added.\n\nSummary: This game was never great. If I had a drill for every time a cloaker one-shot me through a wall or a floor, or for every time I've been pinned by a tazer when he had no line of sight with me, I'd have enough money to buy Overkill.","December 18, 2015","false","200.6"," 103 of 142 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","103","142","12","50"

While the first entry in the series was an un-polished gem, ‘Payday 2’ is bigger, badder and flashier in nearly every regard - a taut, adrenaline-shot affair with explosive running gun-battles around every corner.\n\nGameplay | Key Improvements: Gamers once again assume the role of one of four main protagonists – Dallas, Chains, Hoxton or Wolf – who after a few years in hiding, have descended upon Washington D.C in search of new scores. Originally developed by Overkill Software (a small Swedish Dev.), the franchise has since been acquired by Starbreeze | 505 Games and the larger budget for this late-2013 release is clearly evident in its improved production values - adding all the bells and whistles one would expect from a modern shooter.  More Heists?  – Check – The game consists of 17 unique heists (compared to 7 in the original) adding some great variety that can be played in Single-player (with AI bots) or Online Co-op, with an additional 3 Heists available as DLC.  Better Customization?  – Check – The single biggest improvement from the original game is the inclusion of a deep and well fleshed-out ‘Reward | Customization System’ which allows gamers to use cash earned from heists to acquire and modify a large selection of new weapons and armor, customize masks for more personalized characters, unlock class-specific skills and perks, and customize load-outs for individual missions.  Better Online Matchmaking?  – Check - With the introduction of Crime.net, the game also improves the ability to setup and find online heists across a variety of difficulty levels (from Normal to Overkill) through a well designed User Interface.\n\nFlaws: In considering its shortcomings, many gripes from the original ‘Payday’ unfortunately remain – A continued lack of a single player campaign, and rather simplistic AI, make for a somewhat one-dimensional experience over time. Additionally, graphics and gameplay are basically unchanged – and average graphics (considered below-par for the first game in 2011) seem increasingly out of date in 2014. The randomized ‘Reward-Drop System’ for weapon upgrades | new masks is another area which needs re-work as evidenced by some pro gamers (400+ hours in-game) still unable to get that one mask or weapon upgrade they so crave. Team-balancing issues with online match-making, the seemingly interminable grind to unlock better toys, and a trend toward expensive DLC-only content, mar an otherwise strong offering.\n\nIn the final analysis, ‘Payday 2’ is a great sequel and a phenomenal heist game, improving upon the original in key areas. A fantastic premise supported by a pulsating background score, frenetic action, a good selection of heists and a deep customization system add to the thrill of taking down scores with your crew. Familiar gripes, and some new ones to boot however give this entry a feeling of ‘2 steps forward – 1 step back’, so while an overall improvement, its one achieved in steps not leaps and bounds. Well Recommended (on Sale) for both veterans and newcomers alike – Rated (8.4/10)\n\n\nWant More Recommendations?\nMake sure to click the 'Follow' button on our Curator Page (Link Attached) to get the latest reviews updated directly onto your Activity Feed.

Ranging from stealing cash, gold, jewelry, painting to cooking meth or even "watch the world burn", no heist is the same or repeative. Besides, the random element not just made a come back but also got improved, cameras, civilians and now map layout and guards' route are completely different each time you want to rob or steal something. I highly appreciate this mechanic since it gives us the replayability and above all, you need to plan ahead and patience to carry out the mission like a real criminal.\n\nTeamwork is a must, and of course it would be so much fun if you can play with your friends. Thus, headphone and mic are essential. To complete a heist successfully without ringing any alarm, we need TEAMWORK. Everyone has a role, a Mastermind takes care of guard and cam silently, a Ghost get in and get out undetected and shaped charges, drill and saw from a Tech and a Enforcer leave no safe or vault enclosed. Co-op never been so brilliant and professional like this before.\n\nHowever, failure is still an option and many subjective and objective aspects could screw up the whole thing up. And here we come the other side of Payday, the assault, and again, the 4-classes system shines one more time. Enforcer works like a suppressor tank, Mastermind distracts and Technician finishes anyone comes close. Meanwhile, Ghost grabs anything he could and rushes for the escape car waiting outside. In theory, yeah. Police is not dumb. They throw anything in order to bring you in custody. Initially, only few cops and FBI, but later on, a battalion of SWAT, Taser and Shield storm in from almost everywhere. And did I mention about the f**king Bulldozer? Luckily, with the limited but still sufficient war gears Payday 2 offering, you may escape.\n\nReviewing Payday 2 without referring about the soundtrack is the huge mistake. All the EDM in game are so exciting, catchy and really impress me. Like an adrenaline pumping, it makes every assault section becomes a battlefield of dub step and bullet.\n\nNevertheless, Payday 2 still bugs me about the unlock mechanic. Why you have to unlock the damn hologram optic while you have enough money to buy out the whole company who made them? At least gives us the option to buy things we cant seem to get unlocked.\n\nVerdict: 9,5/10.

A big fan of Payday, I bought the sequel on launch aond found that half the content that they boasted in the pre release trailers and interviews was non existent, which some still is, including a lauded feature to customise your hideout.\n\nIn order to keep the cocaine pile full, they kept releasing weapon and mod expansion packs, charging a fiver for each, while ignoring game-crippling bugs. They have now gotten to the point where they are releasing new heists and missions, but all consist of boring 'click this, wait for the arbitrary time of 5 minutes, then go in and click the next thing and wait again.\n\nThe community is awful, meaning rarely can you get a team that works unless you link up with people you know IRL and that have voice chat. I've been kicked by someone 2 hours into a mission purely because I killed an enemy that he wanted to because he was working on a bloody achievement.\n\nI don't know how much they have improved on the connectivity as I gave up playing this about half a year ago, but getting dropped from games due to a lack of dedicated server, or the ability to migrate the host to another player if the host dropped, not that they'd patch or fix that as they're too busy trying to make me buy another 15 minute heist or another weapon that by all rights, should have been free with the ♥♥♥♥ing game!\n\nA game with honest, true potential has been lost here amongst micro transactions and neglect by the developers who are either being ordered to focus on the wrong things or just don't give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOh, and they got rid of the only playable character with any character from Payday 1 and replaced him with a genetic, unremarkable American. I know they brought him back to pander to fans, but if they think I'm paying money for that ♥♥♥♥, they have another thing coming.","December 24, 2014","false","134.8"," 194 of 289 people (67%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","67","194","289","15","7"

But like so many others who own this game, I am disappointed and angry about the changes made. I can't recommend this game anymore.\n\nI tend to believe some changes were made, namely those to "Rats", due to people exploiting methods in order to earn massive quantities of EXP. I have played this mission many times, and can say that the friends I played this game with and I never exploited it. However, the gameplay changes are still affecting us in ways that ruin the mission for us. Having to wait for an escape vehicle is ridiculous, particularly since the problem with Bain giving wrong directions still hasn't been corrected. Is it intentional? I don't know. It could be a script error, a file-naming error, who can say, but having the lab blow up due to no mistake of our own and not being able to leave until 4 minutes later is a pisser.\n\nThe EXP boost/reduction system when repeating missions is also annoying. If I want to repeat a mission, that's my business. You know, people might be more inclined to not repeat missions over and over if Overkill would actually get on with giving us new missions/heists like they've claimed they would since the game came out...\n\nI could go on, but the bottom line is, the latest update is making tons of people angry, miserable, and annoyed. I'm one of them. If you wanted to make the game difficult and misery-inducing, you should have kept the changes to the Death Wish mode- so real gaming pros and gaming masochists could enjoy it in that difficulty while the rest of us could enjoy what we've enjoyed all along in the game.\n\nI have no intention of playing this game from this point forward. I have no intention of purchasing more DLC. And I plan on avoiding Overkill as a whole because if this is how they treat gamers, and then thumb their noses at us when we complain, they don't deserve my money or my business.\n\nFriends, don't buy this game.","February 28, 2014","false","209.3"," 103 of 144 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","103","144","0","0"

Maybe I'm overexagurating, but it's still agrivating as hell to see a once great game developer release obviously untested material and then attempt to justify themselves.

Also they still refuse to get rid of their microtransaction pay 2 win system which they promised would never happen in the first place.\n\nThey had the perfect opportunity to build an amazing company. They had a wonderful game (which I spent 700+ hours playing), a loyal community following, and had earned the trust and praise of hundreds of thousands of people. Then they threw it all away just to make a few extra dollars. They don't care about the community anymore. They don't care about earning back our trust. They don't care about you.\n\nOverkill does not deserve a single cent of your money. Please do not buy Payday 2 or any Overkill game in the future.\n\nEdit 1: The new paid advertisement DLC game out today. They have the movie trailer playing right when you start up Payday 2.

Not including my account's PC purchases, I've easily hit upper-double-digits in terms of cost.\nI put $50 for the Hype Train with DLC, the COPack, and Hotline Miami 2:Deluxe Edition.\nI had so many ideas on how to rebalance the combat, how to improve the heists' RNG, how to add new mechanics. I became active on the forums.\nBut, after all the lies and inability to address the problem, Overkill has stolen this game from me.\n\nI can look back, and realise just how many issues I plainly ignored because I loved this game. Game-breaking bugs, terrible optimization, brain-dead AI, a useless skill tree, a lack of "real" content, and more.\nMany of these were changed or improved, but far too many over the years.\nI left the console version because they refused to support it. I paid for access to Safehouse Customization and 30 unique heists.\nNope, dropped the support on that one.\nI'm STILL waiting on the Safehouse Customization for the PC version, which was described as being completed before release.\nI also bought this game knowing that there would be "NO microtransactions ([and shame on me for thinking that they'd stoop that low!])".\nShame on me?\nBut worst of all? The Completely Overkill Pack.\n$20, 4 masks, "It isn't a donation" DLC with a secret item coming later. A secret, exclusive, cosmetic-only item "crafted with love and care".\nIt pretty much failed every point there.\nI tried to refund it before they released the secret item, after they went from an unknown amount of time after several months to the end of Crimefest, to a week after Crimefest, to another week after Crimefest.\nRefund denied.\nOr the fact we had to work and grind (which raises the overall play time, which they count on their quarterly reports ;) to unlock access to the "FREE" paid microtransactions.\n\nWhen faced with a MASSIVE backlash, they lied and shifted the blame and refused to acknowledge where the problem came from. "Players seem to be loving it, statistics say otherwise!", "All the media is nothing but clickbait!", "We're sorry, we messed up, we'll fix this, but we're not going to say HOW or WHAT we messed up. We messed up on how we presented it, not the fact it was an immoral, nearly illegal action"\nWhen faced with the massive backlash Day 1, they waited. Complete and total radio silence.\n"We just wanted everyone to calm down! Be rational!"\nand by doing that, they made the changes irreversible.\n\nThey don't care about their community anymore. They can barely listen to their own forum mods.\nAll they care about is money.\nWhich they won't use to fund Payday 2. They'll use it to fund their 8 unrelated, multi-million dollar (each) projects.\nJust stay away.","December 22, 2015","false","611.5"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","64","84","4","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorInsano/recommended/218620/","DoctorInsano","Doctor Insano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorInsano/","235 products in account","So here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.\n\nThat time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release "We will not ever have microtransactions." And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.\n\nLast year, there were a series of "what's next" audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.\n\nLast year, we had "Crimefest," where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.\n\nLast year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were "FBI Files" (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.\n\nThis year, Overkill did a "Hype Train" event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get "hype-fuel" points. With enough "hype-fuel," rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this "Mask Pack 2.0." It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.\n\nAnd most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.\n\nOverkill, shame on you. I do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ♥♥♥ I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats, and I hope your company goes out of business.","October 16, 2015","false","054.1"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","33","34","2","0"

It used to be one of, if not, the best co-op multiplayer game out there. It's fun and time consuming, trying to beat each heists, doing it loud or stealth.\n\nDLCs are kind of expensive, but they're on sales quite often and bring actual content to the game (i.e new weapons, new heists, etc). It's also kind of justified since the game itself doesn't have microtransactions.\n\nUntil Crimefest 2015... What a disaster..

PAYDAY 2 is the next installment after PAYDAY: The Heist.\n\nPAYDAY 2, unlike the previous game, has many improvements, upgrades and changes in the gameplay. You don't just blaze your way around to rob a store or bank, drilling the vault and escape. You need more strategy and planning in PAYDAY 2, which also make stealth approach as an option, and sometimes a primary option for most heist. Doing stealth is not easy, but you get bonuses for doing stealth. Teamwork are more encouraged in PAYDAY 2, especially on stealth approach. As a matter of fact, you will need to work together on stealth heist.\n\nThe police in PAYDAY 2 are more vary and some are even powerful, as some of them are technically not police, but FBI task force. In lower difficulties you may only meet the police and SWAT team, but in higher difficulties, FBI are your primary enemies. Dozer, cloaker, tazer, shield, they are making a return in PAYDAY 2.\n\nThe upgrade system in PAYDAY 2 has also been changed and improved. Unlike PAYDAY: The Heist, you can choose skill tree and perks you prefer the most in PAYDAY 2 and has to focus on that as you cannot become everything, you have to be something for your crew. If you prefer stealth approach, you need to focus on the right skill tree like ghost, or if you like shooting people around, you could be an enforcer. Each skill tree has unique bonus, weapon skill and special equipment, but you are limited with what you are.\n\nWeapons in PAYDAY 2 are also more customizable, barrel, scope or sight, stock, magazine, laser sight and more. You can customize your weapons to suit your skill tree and perks, or just customize them to be something you prefer. Mask can also now be customized with patterns or colors to make yourself unique among other criminals.\n\nGraphics of PAYDAY 2 is far better than the previous, more detailed and more beautiful. With masks and weapons customization system and detailed models, they look so beautiful, making the gameplay so epic and making your customization even more unique. PAYDAY 2 performances are also good, despite sometimes I tend to crash.\n\nIn the latest update, PAYDAY 2 introduced microtransactions system similar to those in CS:GO and Dota 2, despite the promises that there will be never a microtransactions in PAYDAY 2. The weapon skin on PAYDAY 2 have differenced however, as some rare skin includes stats bonuses.\n\nOverall PAYDAY 2 is awesome, I recommend this so much.\n\nRating 9/10","November 26, 2014","true","161.8"," 62 of 83 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","62","83","5","5"

Or perhaps Starbreeze, Starbreez, Starbreeze... Regardless the point still stands. This game has gone to crap. It was so good for so long; even despite the heavy focus on 5-10 dollar DLC with heists, characters, and weapons - which slowly did become less and less about quality and more about making a quick buck (Ninja pack was a bit lacking, Chivalry pack seemed silly, and Jiro just doesn't seem appealing as a character at all). And then Crimefest 2015 came about, and Payday 2 was hit with the microtransaction stick. Yes, now you have 'safes' that drop and you buy (with real money, 2.50 a pop) 'drills' to open them and get weapon skins. Oh, but it gets worse; those skins aren't just cosmetics, but they have actual STATS attached! And it gets EVEN FREAKING BETTER when you realize that these weapon skins with STAT BOOSTS AS IN PAY TO WIN cost an average on Steam's marketplace of... between 15 and 40 dollars, and that price is probably gonna go up. The game's core fanbase is abandoning ship at a rapid rate, and after this free-to-play time during Crimefest ends I'm willing to bet it just dries up.

But at this stage I couldn't recommend it due to the monetisation practices of the developers.\n\nMost recently, after years of promising 'no microtransactions', the developers rewarded the efforts of players during a crimefest event by introducing microtransactions.  Specifically safes that can replace traditional loot from heists and that can only be opened using drills purchasable with real money.  The safes contain weapon skins that can boost stats and conveniently mitigate the effects of a simultaneous 'rebalancing' in which many existing weapons were nerfed.\n\nGiven that many of the nerfed weapons were purchased through DLC on top of a full price game, and given that after paying to open them the new safes can drop skins for weapons that require purchase through further DLC, I think at this stage the exploitation has gone well beyond double-dipping or even possibly triple-dipping.\n\nAnd that is frankly only the tip of the iceberg - the most complete and reasonably presented list of issues that I have seen can be found at; http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/8/598199244886890714/","October 18, 2015","false","36.2"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

The F2P element is in stealth mode but still present.\n\nOverkill also killed off BLT&LUA hooks, so my fancy Payday: The Heist HUD is gone, as well as other mods such as Better Weapon Stats, and the very popular Overkill "Approved" HoxHud..\nOverkill also (badly) ripped off payday2stats hard fanmade work without due credit given.\n\nI wish I hadn't spent money on DLC's and I am still not going to play PD2 as it stands.\n\nKeep demanding Overkill remove stat boosts on weapons and add skins to after-mission drops directly, bypassing the safes! Forgive OK if they turn away from evil again, but never forget!\n\n\nEdit to this review will be in once I've done fair research into the new Update 100 and what it means in terms of microtransactions and the Payday 2 Win element. In short, Overkill has aquired the rights to their game from Starbreeze, a very significant move; in which one of their first actions were to make safes openable without buying keys.

They added lame microtransactions with stat-boosts to guns that they nerfed in the same patch, after saying they'd never do so.  The company has pretty crappy relations with the game community, which could possibly lead to an eventually dead game for online play (no joke).  And map design for recently released maps shows a trend towards boring, tedious gameplay, rather than the inventive gameplay of early maps.\n\n\nNow then, the review proper.\n\nI have around 250 hrs of gameplay in this game. I  bought it in 2014, picking up the GOTY edition, which (mercifully) bundled the DLC that had been released up to that point.  On the whole, the game is entertaining, and has offered a variety of gameplay approaches, including stealth and straight-up action.  Early on, the heists were interestnig and fun (most of the time), and it was cool to plan different builds for your character (e.g. you could build a sort of "tank" approach, or a "stealth" approach, or a "buff/debuff" approach, etc.).  However, I cannot, at this point, recommend the game to new players for several reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, the recent introduction of microtransactions is a major negative.  If all the microtransactions were for was purely cosmetic skins (a la TF2's hats), I'd think it's silly, but it would be tolerable (more on the silliness issue in a bit).  But the weapon skins also include stat buffs.  This also comes at the same time as a recent "balance" update which makes many of the previous builds on weapons far less viable.  Weapons' inherent and modified (through normal additions that randomly drop for free throughout the game) accuracy has been severely hampered.  These two factors, taken together -- a nerf to weapons at the same time as the introduction of microtransactions for skins that buff weapon stats -- is unconscionable, especially in a game that (outside of a sale) already costs you $20, and has almost $100 of individually purchasable DLC (again, at full price).  There's just no excuse for this kind of change to the game.  Moreover, the microtransactions aren't even for the actual stat-modifying skins themselves.  Rather, they're for a system similar to buying keys to open crates a la TF2.  You basically are buying a CHANCE to get the stat modifying skin, you can get duplicates, and you can also get a skin for a weapon that's actually a DLC one you don't even have.\n\nSecond, the company's relationship with its customers is...pretty abysmal.  Two company representatives -- one the now-departed lead designer -- were on record as saying "We will never add microtransactions to the game."  As you can see, the company itself has gone back on this.  However, there have been several other lies, delays, and general mismanagement of community relations.  For a game like this, you aren't just buying the game itself.  The game is constantly changing and being updated by the company -- sometimes in ways you don't like.  But players have no choice but to accept the changes and keep playing, or quit.  It's actually closer to an MMO model in that respect, so ongoing community relations issues matter to this game more than, say, questionable game changes where you can simply roll back to a prior version.  That's not an option here.  In the wake of this microtransaction debacle, the company has remained largely silent, including failures to respond to media inquiries.  My guess is that they're just laying low and hoping this will all blow over.  I wouldn't be so sure.  My point here is that the current company managing the game is not the same company it was when the game launched, and basically is not that interested in maintaining and managing the game's community.  This is a dangerous step, in my opinion.  The game relies on peer-to-peer matchmaking, which means if nobody's playing, your only way to play is to play with bots who are dumber than a bag of hammers.  As community relations continue to deteriorate, it's entirely possible that the game will enter a kind of death-spiral as people continue to quit, to the point where it eventually is about as dead as, oh, Brink.\n\nThird, as I mentioned above, the initial maps you play are, undeniably, a lot of fun.  They showcase the potential for complexity in this game, and inventive map design.  However, recent map releases have all started to focus on a particular style of map.  Basically, it involves "loud" action-oriented maps (or maps where stealth is fairly difficult to maintain), followed by having to drag the loot you steal across a long stretch of ground under fire.  This is tedious and boring, and while the maps look kinda cool the first time, actually playing them is just, well, a drag (pardon the pun).  It appears that the inventive design of prior maps is now a thing of the past, and we're basically going to be relegated to flashy, but boring gameplay.  On top of that, many of the recently released DLC packs have taken the game in increasingly silly directions.  The Chivalry pack and Western pack added medieval and western themed weapons and masks, which really have no business in a game about robbing banks.  It's not uncommon to see people playing with increasingly ridiculous outfits and weapons.  Now, in the end, this is more of a "flavor" thing, and not really a game-killer to me, but it's basically like the addition of "hats" in TF2.  It took the core design of the game and made it that much more ridiculous.  That's fine in a cartoony game like TF2, but this was, at one time, a serious bank-robbing game a la the film Heat.  Your mileage may vary on this issue, though.\n\n\nFor a while, I really enjoyed the game.  I can't deny that.  I question how much fun new players will have, though, given how much grinding you have to do in the game, and given that a good portion of the playerbase is really, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about recent changes, and the company's response appears to be an indifferent shrug or simple silence.  So, yeah, at this point, I wouldn't buy it.","October 19, 2015","false","260.7"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","0"

They showcase the potential for complexity in this game, and inventive map design.  However, recent map releases have all started to focus on a particular style of map.  Basically, it involves "loud" action-oriented maps (or maps where stealth is fairly difficult to maintain), followed by having to drag the loot you steal across a long stretch of ground under fire.  This is tedious and boring, and while the maps look kinda cool the first time, actually playing them is just, well, a drag (pardon the pun).  It appears that the inventive design of prior maps is now a thing of the past, and we're basically going to be relegated to flashy, but boring gameplay.  On top of that, many of the recently released DLC packs have taken the game in increasingly silly directions.  The Chivalry pack and Western pack added medieval and western themed weapons and masks, which really have no business in a game about robbing banks.  It's not uncommon to see people playing with increasingly ridiculous outfits and weapons.  Now, in the end, this is more of a "flavor" thing, and not really a game-killer to me, but it's basically like the addition of "hats" in TF2.  It took the core design of the game and made it that much more ridiculous.  That's fine in a cartoony game like TF2, but this was, at one time, a serious bank-robbing game a la the film Heat.  Your mileage may vary on this issue, though.\n\n\nFor a while, I really enjoyed the game.  I can't deny that.  I question how much fun new players will have, though, given how much grinding you have to do in the game, and given that a good portion of the playerbase is really, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about recent changes, and the company's response appears to be an indifferent shrug or simple silence.  So, yeah, at this point, I wouldn't buy it.","October 19, 2015","false","260.7"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","0"

The gameplay was exciting, the teamwork was awesome, and it never got boring.\n\nLike everyone else, I was excited about this year's crimefest. I was looking forward to seeing what new content we would get. I wasn't expecting anything mindblowing; I recognize that the game has been out for a while now, and that the developers cannot be expected to keep putting out content for which they are not generating cash. However, what we have received thus far can only be considered a scam. We were promised free content. We all put in many hours grinding during the road to crimefest to ensure that we would earn our content. We as a community promoted Payday and the developers, helping them to continue to gain popularity in a game that is more than two years old! And what did we receive in return? Certainly not what I was expecting. Certainly not what any of us were expecting. Microtransactions?! I cannot believe that they are taking a PvE game and making it a P2W.\n\nThe community who has supported this game for a long time now has been completely betrayed, and Overkill has yet to say anything to us, the fans, about why they are doing this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lastplagas/recommended/218620/","lastplagas","Las Plagas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lastplagas/","598 products in account","Giving this game a negative review after playing it for well over 500 hours is quite heartbreaking, but the way Overkill handles feedback is simply not acceptable.\nLet me start off by saying that the Black Market update is not the only time that Overkill screwed up and went silent. The alarms started ringing a year ago, during 2014 crimefest. Two of the promised rewards (FBI files and new enemy) were not featured, even though they were announced months before. Now, don't get me wrong, some difficulties are bound to happen, but do you want to know long it took them to add those two things? A year. Yes, a whole year. Both Captain Winters and FBI files were released on september 24th 2015. Why were they delayed for this long? Who knows? All we ever got from Overkill was: "Don't worry, guys, it's coming soon".\n\nAnd that's not the worst part of that update. FBI files feature is pretty much a carbon copy of the community site  pd2stats[pd2stats.com].  You can go ahead and read the full story about it on that site, but to sum it up, the creator of that site was invited over to Overkill's studio, promised that FBI files will be completely different and that he and his team will be involved. After that visit all he ever got from Overkill was "We will contact you very soon, don't worry". Year later, the site got reasonably popular and it was pretty difficult to sustain it. The guy behind the site asks Overkill if they should just include the site in their FBI files update, because he can't keep it on anymore. No response. And so the site dies and we get FBI files. Great job, Overkill. You most certainly did not act like scum.\n\nAfter that, in march this year we got the Infamy 2.0 update. This was something that many players (including me) were eagerly awaiting. Before this update happened, Almir Listo, the producer of Payday 2 popped up and said that the update will feature something much cooler than just new masks . So update gets released and what does it feature? 20 new experience levels and 8 new masks\patterns\materials. Excuse me, Almir, but where is all this promised cool stuff? The original infamy update at least gave you some slight gameplay benefits for each infamy level in addition to the masks. This is just nothing. Oh, but don't worry, because after this fiasco, he popped up again to say  "Sorry guys, we'll think about adding something else later on". Nothing was added. What a surprise.\n\nA week after Infamy 2.0 we got the Hype Train event earlier this year. Players had to collect gallons of "hype fuel" to unlock the in-game rewards such as new heists, masks, etc. How do you collect those gallons? Buy one of the two dlc packs: overkill pack (3 gallons) and completely overkill pack (14 gallons). Overkill pack was the usual run of the mill weapon pack, even though it featured probably the most overpowered weapon in the game and was priced at the usual $5. The Completely Overkill Pack had 4 masks and was priced at $20. I ♥♥♥♥ you not. 4 masks and nothing else. It did not even include the weapons from the normal overkill pack, so you had to buy both. Everyone who bought it was also promised a "super cool exclusive cosmetic reward later on". They have yet to recieve it. And guess what? Overkill is silent about it.\n\nNeedless to say, the community was quite upset about the way this event was handled. I assure you that the later goals of Hype Train would not be met if Overkill didn't start counting every pre-order of Hotline Miami 2 (which was being released at the time) as additional "hype fuel". Back then, many people were already quite cautious, because Overkill could just be testing the waters with this cosmetic dlc. What a surprise, they were.\n\nWelcome to Crimefest 2015. We have stat-boosting microtransactions. ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nNot to mention, they did this after claiming that "PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)".\nNot only that, but we screwed up the weapon balance in the same patch, just so you don't get too comfortable. That fully automatic shotgun you payed for in one of our previous dlcs? Oh, it deals 25 damage now. But this handgun easily reaches 200.  Why?  Because ♥♥♥♥ you, that's why. Go buy our safes.\nAnd of course, radio silence from the developers. According to one of the mods from the steam forums Almir doesn't want to make a statement, because community will  "nitpick and take it the wrong way" [i.imgur.com]. God forbid your feelings get hurt. Wiping your tears with dollar bills is probably incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nIn the latest (day 4) crimefest update Overkill have announced that they will only talk about our concerns with the update after the event ends. They are hoping that all the outrage will die down by that point and they will just get to apologize again and be forgiven as usual.\n\nThat simply will not happen, Overkill. Shame on you if you thought otherwise.","October 18, 2015","false","515.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

So you can't just ignore it, because you're ignoring an improved weapon that Overkill is saying, hey, pay for it or you'll be worse then those that did already.

Reviews often mention pros along with cons, or will admit if something is redeeming or good. You might hear that the mechanics are great but content is lacking, for example.\n\nAmongst many AAA games from greedy publishers, or with terrible quality, or maybe even just a poorly done port, I find the steam community often always has it covered. Sometimes, I think the steam community just likes to ♥♥♥♥ on things, and do it hard and dirty, and some things unfairly get a bad rap, or the rap lasts a little longer than it needs to.\n\nI have never, ever felt the need to put up a negative review for a game. Most of the games I go for have some redeeming or unique quality, if I don't find them to be wholly good. Other things, usually have the reputation they deserve.\n\n======================================\nBut this...\n\nOverkill, you absolutely deserve absolutely every negative review you get.\n\nMore than that, you don't just deserve what you get...you are so deserving, that I think people should go out of their way to make sure you know how the gaming community feels about these kinds of business practices. Even if it doesn't effect their personal experiences with the game much.\n\nGot it as a gift? Doesn't matter.\n\nOnly have one hour in the game? Doesn't matter.\n\nNever bought any of their blatant advertisement DLC? Doesn't matter.\n\nMaybe you just think this ♥♥♥♥ is bound to happen eventually, and shake your head. No, ♥♥♥♥ that, doesn't matter.\nThey deserve to know this isn't right, no matter who you are, how much, or what you've invested.\nDon't let this go.","October 16, 2015","false","24.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","38","46","2","5"

However, the devs released it long before it was actually ready. Right off the bat I didn't receieve the bonus loot I was supposed to get for pre-ordering. The game itself was actually very enjoyable. For about 3 days. Then you realize that most of the heists are just various versions of other heists, stealth is next to impossible, the higher difficulty levels are on the ridiculous side, and the bugs are overwhelming. For goodness sakes the newest patch made Payday not recognize your keyboard (I myself was included in this glitch). Add that with cops glitching through walls, heists that glitch key parts of it, etc and you've got a game that you shouldn't waste your money on. Especially since it seems since its release the devs would rather dish out DLC for you to pay for rather than fix the problems the game already has.","March 2, 2014","false","238.4"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","40","50","0","0"

While almost every day seemed like it was part of an elaborate joke, there was no punchline. Almir, the head of the company, did an AMA on Reddit, and has outright said that the microtransactions will not be removed, that the stat bonuses from skins will not be removed, and that everything is going great on their end. He says that the only people upset are a very vocal minority.\n\nI've already bought this game. I've already bought a lot of the DLC (most of it). But I won't be buying any more games from Overkill. Almir wants to present Overkill as a tiny independent dev company, and this is not the case. Almir wants to pretend that the community was happy to have the safes, the crappy skins, and the stat bonuses, and we are not. Almir wants to pretend like Overkill is struggling, and needs the funds from microtransactions to stay afloat, while their parent company's own financial reports (publicly visible, since they are a publicly traded company) prove otherwise. In fact, they show that Payday 2 has been raking in the money.\n\nThe blatant lies and disregard for the community shown by Almir, who is apparently acting as their community spokesperson as well, since nobody else has said a word, are rather disappointing. Even more disappointing, since this is, in fact, a great game.\n\nOriginal: This is a great game, and right now, you should not buy it.\n\nPrior to release, the devs outright said that there would be no microtransactions. Then, on the first day of an event they said would be full of free rewards for the players, after completing a large series of challenges, they added microtransaction safes that give you (awful looking) skins for weapons, along with stat boosts for said weapons.\n\nThe endless cycle of DLC was already getting to be a little much, but with blatantly going back on their word, trying to downplay the blowback, and attempting to silence and wait out the anger in their community, I would recommend against this game.\n\nPerhaps if the microtransactions are removed, the safes no longer possible to receive instead of a payout for finishing a mission, some way to earn keys without actually spending money, the stat boosts removed, perhaps then it might be worth picking up again.\n\nBut then you'll have to ask yourself: Is this a company I can trust anymore?","October 18, 2015","false","139.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","0"

The most recent update has broken stealth mechanics quite a bit, to where every Heist requires you to "go Loud."  Even when your aim is go loud from the beginning, the new special units are so incredibly overpowered in all difficulties that it actually makes the game, not more challenging, but less fun.\n\nI loved Payday 2 when it was first out.  It had a great blend of stealth and gunplay, and the addition of the Infamy system gave reason to replay everything (even though the game is a giant exp/cash grind in the first place), but the newest updates has just ruined my motivation to even bother playing.\n\nOVERKILL seems to be more concerned with finding ways to make the current missions hacker/grind-proof, instead of focusing on providing new (longer than 3 day) Heists.  When you've already done every Heist 50+ times in an effort to hit level 100, of course you're going to grind the higher payday Heists.  Their solution was to give you a penalty to running the same mission more than once in a row, and to add units that will literally one-hit incapacitate you.  It's just not fun.  Hopefully some day they'll listen to the community and roll back the recent changes, but until that day, I'm just not in the mood to lose Heists over and over to absurd changes.","February 28, 2014","false","96.4"," 50 of 67 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","50","67","0","0"

It's a good way to pass the time if you have absolutely nothing better to do.\n\nHOWEVER. Recently, they added a crate and key system to the game, similar to TF2, DOTA 2, and CS:GO. The only difference, is the weapons you unbox are direct upgrades from anything you can buy with the in-game currency. This adds a very "Pay-To-Win" feel to the game which is something they said they weren't going to do, and something that is extremely unfair to people who can't pay real money. The only thing that stops it from being directly "Pay-To-Win" is that you can find both the Safes and Drills (Crates and Keys), but the drop chance on them is so small that it's easier to just buy them.\n\nMy over-all view of the game is this: Don't play this game UNLESS\nYou have a decent amount of money laying around\nYou are OK with broken AI and strange pathing/animations\nYou want to support devs who lieOtherwise, just stear clear as the majority of the community is pompous d-bags who will kick you from the lobby the second they see you aren't at least Infamy level 1.","April 4","false","14.8"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","38","47","4","1"

Personally, I don't have any problems with the skins that were implemented in the game. My promblems are (as you probably guessed it) Stat Boosts and Microtransactions. On top of that, PAYDAY 2 has a lot of DLCs (reaching a total price of more than $100 for the base game + all DLCs) The two things mentioned earlier could be solved easily. For example, you could buy a drill with in-game money (which would probably get exploited by the hackers) or even better, you could get drills as drops, just like you get safes.

Not one sniper rifle comes in the regular game. All DLC. You also get no grenades without DLC. None of those 'throwables' are free, either. So be prepared to spend more than ticket price if you want a wide variety of weapons.\n\nI'm not going to go in depth about the microtransaction stuff, plenty others have already made their reviews about it, and I'm too new to really pass judgement on that stuff, although I hate TF2 crate/key like things, and that's what they added to PD2. Dont' know why, since it's alredy a game that you have to buy. Oh, and the 'skins' that come out of them actually give stat boosts, so that's a thing.\n\nTL;DR? Amazing game, but if you want more than a 'demo' of the game almost, you're gonna be paying more than the game's price. I'm really neutral about the game, but I'm going to say No to it just for the fact that every update they do is just DLC and Microtransations are a horrible trend that games are taking nowadays... even in games that you pay for, apparently. Thanks for starting that trend, Payday 2.\n\nTL;DR the TL;DR?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/recommended/218620/","DominoEventide","Domino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/","156 products in account","Since I came to the realization that my previous review of this game was more of a generic complaint explicitly directed towards DLC, I've decided to redo it. Be warned, while I wrote this thing in under an hour, it is a LONG read. I actually had to put the full thing in a pastebin, linked at the bottom, due to the issue of reaching the maximum character limit.\n\nThat being said, welcome to hell. No refunds.\n\nWhere to start?... Payday 2, it was a great game. However, it suffered a slow, but sure downhill ride ever since around the beginning of 2014, a couple months after I first played the game. I had fun with it. I even would've called myself a 'Payday 2 fanboy' at a certain point when I was still under its spell. But any rational person who has played the game long and often enough will tell you that the fun and quality in this game has been burnt out for him/her. Here's why:\n\nDLC\nNot starting with that this time since people will likely assume that I'm just whining due to being poor\n\nHost/lobby problems\nI could get over the heinous and obnoxious players in public games, and overall awful in-game community. The majority are morons while a small minority are 'professionals' who believe they know best (and, coincidentally enough, in the case of this game, they usually do. However, this is only because the game is largely and insidiously easy. I'll elaborate on that further in a bit). This is a problem that just about every game, especially those which are free to play, has to terrifying extents, but it's still easy to get used to it.\n\nWhat I don't like, and am perfectly justified in not liking? Lack of host migration. Inexcusable connectivity issues. Unfair loss of progress as a result thereof.\n\nEven the oldest and most infamous of online multiplayer of games have host migration. Warcraft III has it. EVEN CALL OF DUTY OF ALL THINGS HAS IT. Every online multiplayer game of this day and age which doesn't use dedicated/listen servers interchangably or explicitly and is at least somewhat heard of has host migration, and there is absolutely no reason why Overkill/Starbreeze (I don't know who would be responsible for an addition like this, and I do not care) can't take a slight bit out of the tens of millions of dollars they're raking in every year to quell a big portion of complaints players have. Wouldn't you be upset if, for a hypothetical instance, you were one of the four record-setters for the Deathwish X-mas heist challenge (if you don't know what I'm referring to, get out. You're too new/unexposed to the game to even understand this review), and after so much trial-and-error, so much work of tossing tens of bags all around the map to kite cops and get them all to the pick-up area, only for the host to suddenly have a power outage JUST as the last heister is about to step into the escape zone? Or maybe in a public lobby, the host just decides he's "bored" when a heist you've been working on with him is about to be completed successfully, and that same host just decides, 'well, meh, nuts to them!'\n\nAs for connectivity issues, and why they are completely unforgivable, have you ever noticed other players' latency? Oh, you haven't? Well, that's the right answer! Because Payday 2 has no way, shape, or form of displaying others' strength of connectivity. The only way to get an actual 'ping' is to mod, or, dog for bid, hack your game. In my experience using pocohud for the short time that I did before quitting, I never found anyone who had under a 150ms ping. And when I say short time, it was really more of 100-200 hours (take note of my playtime) of constant hosting/joining other players games (WITH MY PLAYERS FILTER SET ON "NEAR," BEFORE YOU QUESTION IT). In actual gameplay, actual 'lag' doesn't seem to affect much at a glance. However, it is very, very easy to take note of irritating issues such as cops shooting you through walls before they actually come within line-of-sight on your screen, extended delay between throwing/picking up bags and other interactive items, etc. This kills the game for me, as it defeats the purpose of taking cover or playing defensively at all since you can always just be sniped and meatshotted by an enemy's gun that may as well be several seconds into the future for anyone who isn't the host.\n\nPoor updates\nI'm not disputing that this game does get quite a bit added to it on a fairly regular basis; although, I am not content with the 'new' content. The fugitive skill tree is a laughable excuse of a lazy combination between the mastermind and ghost trees that also encourages running around and generally being a nuisance. I never liked the last-minute throw-in of a 'perk deck' system which is just another thing to grind for in order to take advantage of on the side. Every 'new' heist is either 'steal that,' or 'destroy/kill that object/person,' making it feel as if the game lacks any intuitive feeling even more than it already does. Every patch is a force-fed shovelling of bloated/expensive content, which makes the game more unstable, that also has minimal to nonexistent bugfixes alongside it.\n\nThere is a reason why there are practically memes now which compare Overkill to EA. The game doesn't get supported or improved, it just gets more content. While that might seem nice, think about what you're missing out on. Would you rather have one slice out of a pure wheel of cheese, or the whole wheel of cheese after it's sat out in the sun for weeks and become spoiled and moldy? More is not better when what you're adding to is already a structure that is barely up to code and can only have so much at once in the first place. One must find a balance between quality and quantity, or just go all out on quality and make it so impressive that players will be left WANTING more. The best updates to Payday 2, however, involve one single 'new' heist, while the worst, and most common updates are nothing more than a few reskins of current weapons/weapon mods with superior stats which have to be paid for, which technically makes the game unquestionably pay-to-win to a degree. Yes, it really does. If you don't believe that, you seriously need to do some comparing between free, community, and paid-for weapons/weapon mods. Or, perhaps, you can try one of the newer shotguns with explosive rounds so you can stunlock the toughest enemy in the game at will, and throw all other enemies up in the air (INCLUDING CLOAKERS AND SHIELDS, which are SUPPOSED to require tactical teamwork and clever initiative to defeat) all just by giving Overkill another one of your $5 bills. Tell me THAT isn't a freemium model, I dare you, I WANT to see you make a fool of yourself by insinuating otherwise. Furthermore, please don't give me any "you don't need it to play" or "don't like it, don't buy it" comments, or anything of a similarly snide and unhelpful nature, because I've already heard this excuse many times. You really do need the DLC if you want to fully experience the game or not be completely alienated from the playerbase. Additionally, I already paid the full $30 for this game, and seeing the cash cow still being milked in the same way after all this time is a metaphorical kick to the balls and a loogie to the face. It's absolutely insulting and revolting to be blatantly treated like a walking wallet to be empited on a game developer's whim. Overkill does NOT -need- all the money that they're making, they're just being greedy and overextending themselves. Even if I didn't -need- the DLC, it still doesn't make what's being done with it right.\n\n(The rest of the review has been cut off due to the Steam character limit.

Community was fun, the game itself great, but as time went on, it kind of died on me for a number of reasons.\nWhenever my friends and I played, it was a blast robbing banks, mowing down cops, and raking in the loot, but again, the game jaded quickly for me. I soon realized this game has less diversity that its prequel. You run in, place drill, wait for drill, grab bags or the MacGuffin, and fire bucket everything to the truck. Basically all levels can be summed up as that. Sure, theres a couple variations, but they were ruined with patches (atleast for me). For instance, Framing Frames was a fun stealth mission, until they ruined stealth (again, in my opinion). If you like the new changes, good for you, but I can't stand more guards coming in for basically no reason.\nThen, came the DLC. Yes, you pay for the game. Now, you need to chip in a few more bucks for grenades. Now another couple for snipers! I hoped with the price tag of $30, I'd get ATLEAST the grenades, but sadly not. People tell me that these are "optional" and don't really impact gameplay, but its still the principle of the thing that counts. Its not really fun sitting in the bank vault while all your teammates chunk grenades into the hall. Then theres the community. If you are not a high level, or "prestiged" several times, expect to be kicked or raged at a ton. If you have no idea what they mean by "rushing" expect to be kicked. If you accidently set off the guard, or if the host's friend sets off the guard and blames you, again expect to be kicked. Don't trust randos to play this game.\nSpeaking of which, the AI. Imagine the similar L4D AI. Now imagine that you need stuff done besides infinite shooting, like lugging a ton of bags that only you can do. Expect to only do missions that doesn't require bags with AI.\nFinally, I keep this game updated, just in case any of my friends want to do some rounds, but it gets ridiculous at points.

The developers have gotten very, very greedy.\n\nTL;DR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S04HEoIzVIw\n\nUpdates they have said will be free come up as paid (This has happened numerous times now) and with their current event, Hype Train you unlock  'free content' for the entire community by buying DLCs (And Hotline Miami 2, because that game is badass). The worst part? Most of the 'free content' you unlock is actually even more DLC you have to pay for.\n\nQuote from Hype Train Q&A: Q: Do I have to buy DLC in order to get the Hype Train event rewards?\nA: No, as we said, the Hype Train rewards are unlocked for free for everyone.\n\nNow lets take a look at this 'free' content:\nButcher modpack: Already out for 5$\nGolden GRIN Casino preview: They are literally letting you view a mission so you can buy it later. Very free!\n\nAs of writing this review I can't be sure about the Bonnie character pack and the Hoxton Revenge Heist.. It is worded in such a way that would make you believe it would be free. But with the reputation of overkill, I would not be surprised (Look what they did with Butcher Mod Pack).\n\nNow lets remember, to unlock these 'rewards' the community has to pay for DLC. Which means, this event is literally buy DLC to unlock more DLC that everyone can buy themselves. It is for this reason, that many people I know who play this game simply download a trainer and unlock everything for themselves without paying (I don't personally agree with this and have never done it, but I can really see the appeal).\n\nIf you think all of this is okay, you probably shouldn't have the money in your wallet anyway - because overkill needs their Payday 2.\n\nP.S sorry for that joke on the end but it's ♥♥♥♥ing TRUE.","February 27, 2015","false","110.9"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","41","54","0","6"

Interesting part, they DISABLED LUA MODS, why? Easy answer, to dispose GoonMod, why? GoonMod had feature which allows you to make your own skin to your weapon using patterns and colours. And they disabled mods to prevent mods which allows you to have skin for free. Funny thing, they let hackers to cheat money, weapons, mission, but when it comes to buying skins, they just blocked the way you can mod the game.\n\nWhat would I say? Don't buy this game, don't buy these DLCs, and if you already own the game, you better uninstall it because I don't think Mr. Almir, and whole Overkill will ever listen to us, fans.

Washington, and don't care about the gamers.\n\nEdit after Crimefest: Game is more playable now, some mods came back, but still - there is something they won't fix up, my trust towards their creations.

Gameplay (4/10)	The most interesting of the bunch, the only problem is that they nerfed every good gun in the game and buffed every bad gun to insane levels, the only way to get the old guns to perform decently is to pay money on microtransactions to have a chance of maybe getting a skin that might be for a dlc you own or might not and then it could be for your gun and then after all that it could have no stat boosts.	Longetivity (7/10)	There are alot of heists, I'll give them that, and there's a billion ways to complete each one. The only problem is that all the recent heists feel really like filler content, they're all forgettable (dont get me started on alesso)	Story (2/10)	Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ this story wants to make me shoot myself. The story starts out making sense, people rob banks and get money, and then you have the recent heists and weapon dlcs making it so you're a team of anime-mask wearing, suit running, bullet dodging, health regenerating, jumping out of planes with stacks of cash.

It's a good co-op game, fun, I'd have even recommended it despite me losing interest in it over time.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nCrimefest is an annual event where Overkill releases free content (Keyword being FREE) over the course of around 10 days. This content is unlocked and of course released bit by bit, every day over the event. This year, all the rewards were unlocked.\n\nAnd day 1 is where I'm thrown off completely. They take CS:GOs idea of weapon crates which are opened to give cosmetic weapon skins, and do their own thing with it. How do you open this CS:GO-esque crate? Microtransactions. First day and they've already turned their backs to the "free" content given during Crimefest.\n\nFrankly, all I see are a bunch of greedy developers. They developed absolutely ridiculous DLC as of late in order to get money, but this is just way past the line.

I haven't played Payday 2 for very long, but I probably put about the same amount of hours back in the beta. I haven't bought all the dlc, but quite a bit. I was excited for this game to succeed, but following the addition of microtransactions (in the form of drills to open safes that randomly drop) for skins that could increase stats on a gun (that you may or may not have) is just ridiculous considering on multiple occasions Overkill has stated there would never be microtransactions added to this game. They flat out lied to their community's face, and frankly, don't even care. At one point, I would have recommended this game, but now? Absolutely NOT! This is a disgusting thing that this company has done, and they should be disgraced at their actions and behavior towards the community.

While it might have benefitted with a cool story arc for a single player mode the game offers a great outing with 3 other friends for an experience that will keep having you come back for more. Payday is simply put the improved, polished and closest experience you’ll find to robbing an actual bank.A superb co-op shooter, with rich character customisation and unpredictable missions.It's not the desire for cash or gold that'll keep you coming back, but the desire to pull off the perfect heist. The many missions and unlockables also offer plenty of food for many hours raid pleasure.In the end, this is by far the most engrossing co-operative arcade experience I have had in a while, probably the best since Left 4 Dead 2 came around.The guns really feel exciting and dangerous - one of the key differences between a good shooter and a great one. I have a feeling this one will stay with us for a while.Payday 2 is a great game and a damn good sequel.

DLC works like "Booster Packs" for CCG/TCGs to enable additional options and missions. Several achievements, the best missions, and best equipment are all behind the DLC paywall. After purchasing all the DLC, a few other games by the same studio, and joining the Steam Community Group (total $160+ regular price), the game opens up and becomes fully playable.\n\nAs of the 2015 annual community event and sale, "gachapon" lottery style microtransactions have been added to the game at $2.50 per random draw despite lead developers stating PayDay 2 will NEVER have microtransactions (1, 2) and advertising the 2015 event rewards will be free of charge for all users (3). Lottery rewards include equipment "skins" with mechanical bonuses to further reward those who pay in.\n\nDespite overwhelming negative response from the community, studio and publisher representatives are refusing to directly comment as to the future of the lottery style microtransactions until AFTER the community event and sale are over, effectively threatening users who have not already gone "all-in" on DLC with higher prices (4). Some of the founding members of Overkill Software have left the company along with key developers and voice actors, threatening future development of the game.\n\nThis is a co-op first-person shooter with stealth and RPG elements. The core gameplay is above average with an active modding community that continues to improve the UI experience. It is a solid go-to on par or better than games like Left-4-Dead, Team Fortress, and Counter-Strike; however, the DLC paywall and microtransactions on a full price game make this difficult to recommend.

Started a family sharing account to reset my stats to get the joy of starting from scratch and level up again. I actually reset 3 or 4 times and loved every minute of that game.\n\nThen a few months ago, the devs started releasing more and more dlcs with very little content (for the same price as before) even though the community was speaking out loud about the poor quality of dlcs (I mean we got a chivalry crossover with swords and bows, what the f*** does this have to do with a cops vs robbers game?!). Crossovers for the simple reason and I quote "because we at Overkill f***ing love that game/movie!" They recently said that they were working on tons of crossovers and one of them that they were "laughing while making it". Why are you laughing making a dlc of a cops vs robbers game?! Goat Simulator heist because you f***ing love that game? I loved the game, put more hours in this game than any other game I have but I still had a glimpse of hope for good content when crimefest was announced...\n\nThen crimefest started...well the pre-crimefest I should say. We had to follow the VA's for the game on twitter. Ok that doesn't sound so bad at 1st glance but then they wan't 50k followers. Seems much but guess how much Overkill and Payday have for followers? Yeah you guessed right, not even 50k but yet they want us to reach 50k followers for some of the VA's. Day 1 of this event had 1 of those and the community wasn't happy about it, they said it loud and clear. But then what happens on day 3 of the event? Yep, 2 more twitter challenges, and it took a sh**storm from the community for them to replace them with in-game challenges (which everyone wanted). It really feels as if they don't even play their own game or read anything on the forums unless probably a mod tells them "euh guys, people are about to bomb Overkill's HQ, might wanna come do some damage control". That's what it took for them to revert their decision.\n\nNow this wonderfull pre-crimefest ended and the actual crimefest came around. A huge 5.3 GB update for drastically nerfing good weapons (which became useless) and drastically buffing bad weapons to make them OP. This wasn't their 1st balance in the game (they did a perk deck balance, exp system balance and more I can't think of right now) and each and everytime, they wen't from one direction to a complete different direction. That must be why they're called Overkill, can't do it just a little bit to make it balanced, lets go Overkill!!\n\nBut that's not the worst part about the crimefest, noooo. They added micro-transactions...\n"But hey Fr00t_L00ps, CS:GO has micro-transactions and sooo many people play this game and don't complain about them!" Well you would be right BUT the micro-transactions are weapon skins and some of them actually give, wait for it... Weapon stats boost! Makes so much sense, a skin that boosts your weapon! The dlc's already made the game arguably pay to win (some agreed, some didn't. I sort of agreed) but then they buff all the weapons, and if you want them good again, you have to pay with real life money? What the actual f*** Overkill?! 2 of the main devs of the game (one which doesn't work for Overkill anymore, go wonder) stated when the game was released that they would never implement micro-transactions in the game. And now they did... "But hey! we want to support this dev to keep releasing content!". Well guess what, the new content is garbage 90% of the time, it's overpriced unless bought on special and it's pretty much a bunch of reskins with different stats. Overkill isn't that small indie company that needs the support from their community anymore, they make a ton of money. Starbreeze (which owns Overkill) has seen their income raise significantly in the past few months, but the useless DLCs started showing up after that income was high. They had no reason to release pointless DLCs like what they did. And if they really listened to the community like they say they do, they would have taken steps in a different direction to make the game better. Now as of today October 15th 2015, the micro-transactions are the worst garbage any game has ever had, even though i'm sure they're gonna change the formula, still won't change the fact that they thought it would be a good idea even though the community has been complaining about overpriced lack of content dlcs, and this is one of them... Again...\n\nOh and don't get me started on desync and the countless amout of bugs that have been getting worst and worst since day 1 of the game. Sooo much potential ruined by poor development. I'm gonna miss the good old Payday 2 days when the game was enjoyable and when the devs cared about the content. Now it's a cashcow and they're milking it to the end. Still thanks for the good times Overkill...\n\nTL:DR : Used to LOVE the game, Micro-transactions to make you win you can't get through normal progression. Recent DLCs are overpriced for the content they offer. Desyng and bugs...omg bugs... Don't buy unless you're really rich and don't care about a buggy game.","October 15, 2015","false","288.0"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","3"

It's still fun, and it's easy to enjoy, especially when you're playing with friends. However, as time goes on, I've noticed that paid DLC continue to come out on almost a monthly basis, to the point where I've spent almost twice as much money on DLC as I have the game itself. Time after time after time, Overkill (the developers of the game) will add new content and force it behind a paywall, to the point where the vast majority of content is locked behind DLC. There are almost twenty paid DLCs at the time of writing this review.\n\nHowever, the final straw came today, when they announced "free" content being released to the community. The first thing they did was release microtransactions. On the first day of a "free" update. This is made even more outrageous by the fact that Overkill has said in repeated statements that they never have and never will incorporate microtransactions of any sort into Payday 2. With the blatant lying and money-grabbing, I've lost all support for this game. If you want your money's worth, look somewhere else.","October 15, 2015","false","328.6"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"
