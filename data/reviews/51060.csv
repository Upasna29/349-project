It's a mixture of hidden object finding, using the right objects from your inventory in the right places, and solving a number of moderately taxing puzzles. Well ok, the puzzles aren't that hard to complete, but a number of achievements rely on solving them quickly, or within a certain number of moves, or without making any mistakes. That's actually quite difficult for some of the puzzles on your first attempt where you're trying to figure out what to do, but a second playthrough would snag those. Still, it's not the kind of game to play through more than once, it's a linear story, it's not particularly difficult, and it's over in a little over four hours. As for the ending... what just happened? It was all very rushed, a bit confusing, and left all kinds of questions hanging! I guess it was meant to be a cliffhanger for the sequel, but it felt a bit anticlimactic. Thanks for that. Still, great little puzzle game, pretty easy, looks great, nice music, I liked it. Speaking of the sequel, it doesn't appear to be on Steam yet.","February 4, 2014","true","4.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

Not overly simple, but not aggravatingly hard either. Light to moderate challenge I'd say as far as puzzles go, and the music is pleasant to listen to when playing for an hour or two in a sitting. It does have some of the common puzzle game annoyance of having to backtrack and travel though page after page to get from A to E and back to finish some puzzles, but I've seen games where it's much more of an issue. I play it when I feel like a calm, casual game that I can play at my leisure.

I enjoyed jumping into different paintings and having to use elements from them or the scenery elsewhere. However, sometimes I got the feeling I was being sent back and forth between paintings or rooms an aweful lot. A bit frustrating with all of the loading, not to mention that the game crashed on me three times from start to finish.\n\nThat aside, this game has an interesting and touching plot with bits of information about Iris and her past and possible future in pieces of paper scattered throughout the game and scenes with recordings to keep you motivated. When playing you require patience and smarts, but puzzles can be skipped after a few minutes have gone by (achievements are lost if you skip or don't solve them before this period of time runs out) and luckily there's also Franklin to give a hint or two (and not the easiest ones, at that!). Overall I had a good time playing this game and admiring the graphics. Definitely a recommended game to those who love puzzles and want to take their time completing them.\n\nI hope to see the two sequals of Drawn available on Stream soon.","August 24, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And for this reason, I am not recommending the game.\n\nSome of the blame for my negative feelings about the game falls on me, as I didn't look into the game and purchased it solely on the Steam store page (description, "about this game", screenshots and tags). The tags at the time of purchase were "adventure", "casual", "point & click" and "puzzle". My expectations and hopes were that it would be reminiscent of a LucasArts adventure game.\n\nSteam doesn't give the option of star-ratings or a "maybe" or "neutral" - If any of these were options, my answer wouldn't be a flat "no". If you can get this game on sale in the $2-$3 range, then yes, I recommend it.\n\nTL;DR Pros:\n- Pretty artwork.\n- Fun concept.\n- Short and light.\n\nTL;DR Cons:\n- "Adventure game" mechanics are severely dumbed-down.\n- Almost entirely games of fetch or hidden items, with a few pattern/number puzzles.\n- Crashed multiple times.\n\nThe graphics are nice and I enjoyed the concept of the main character's magic.\n\nHowever, the "adventure game" mechanics are boring and dumbed-down to the point where the majority of the "adventure game" type puzzles involve just finding the inventory items that you need. Go to point A to find ___, then go to point B to use it. In most cases, just *seeing* the item in the scene is the hardest part (don't get me wrong, some "hidden object" games can be fun... but those games aren't the same as adventure games).\n\nThe times that you need to combine items to solve a puzzle, and it's not made instantly 100% obvious, are few and far between.\n\nDrawn switches between this item finding mechanic and actual pattern or math puzzles.\n\nThe game also ended up crashing multiple times. Fortunately, no progress was lost from any of the crashes.","February 8","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, its façade is beautiful, but that does not outweigh the many problems with the game’s construction. I have played many puzzle games and most have a beautiful exterior. It is generally the story’s depth, the game’s mechanics, and the variety of engaging puzzles that make for a fun puzzle adventure. This game lacked quality in all of the above.\nProblems:\n(The Story): This story’s depth runs about as deep as a 3 year old child’s written work. Harsh, but true. The only creativity or beauty seen in this game is visual; that would be fine if this were a pretty painting being sold for 10 dollars and not a puzzle adventure game.\nYou would be better off grabbing a snack and a movie at your local cinema than playing through this. That would cost the same time and money as Drawn: the Painted Tower, but at least you would have more to say about it than “It’s pretty”.\n\n(Mechanics): As other negative reviewers have said, the game crashes frequently. Also, when you use hints, they come in order of steps needing to be accomplished within a given room. So, if you are at a loss at the end of a room and need a hint, you will have to go through all of the room’s hints to get to the one you are after.\n\n(Puzzles): I don’t know about you, but for me, variety is key in a puzzle game. The variety in Drawn was not so great, but the main problem with some of Drawn’s puzzles is that there are no instructions. So when you do get excited about a hard looking puzzle, your excitement is likely to fade by the time you figure out what exactly you are supposed to do. (In short) Having no instructions was okay a lot of the time, but it was frustrating when a clever looking puzzle was not intuitive.\n\n(Conclusion): Drawn: The Painted Tower is a picture book game for toddlers that frequently crashes, has disappointing puzzles, and will last about as long as a lord of the rings movie.\n","December 29, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
