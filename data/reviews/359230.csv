Maybe good for a player new to the series or one lapsed for a long time, but somewhat simple for series veterans.\n\nEdit: All the major bugs I experienced in my initial review have since been fixed.\n\nLethis is a clear spiritual successor to the games of the Impressions City Building series (Caesar, Pharaoh, Zeus, and Emperor). All of the core mechanics of the series (housing evolution, random walkers, etc.) are here in their usual forms. You build housing, immigrants arrive, and you must supply the housing with food, goods, and services, causing it to evolve and support more workers. You must balance your treasury by importing and exporting goods, and by taxing your citizens. The game plays largely as expected of the series, with the only real surprise being a perplexing inversion of the standard mouse button functions (i.e. left click to examine a building instead of right), with no options that I could find to customize the controls.\n\nThe art style is excellent 2-D isometric, with a cartoony style that reminds me of the Ankama Studios games (Wakfu, Dofus, etc.). Walkers have both male and female versions for all the walkers I could see, which is a nice touch. I miss the voice-acted walker dialogue from the old games, but I understand the budgetary constaints that kept them out.The graphics are likely the only area in which Lethis markedly improves upon it's predeccessors.\n\nMy major complaints with the game are twofold: the relative simplicity of the game compared to its predeccessors, and the significant raft of launch bugs.\n\nMechanically, Lethis doesn't particularly add anything to the other entries in the Impressions City Building Series. The game's complexity is slightly above that of Zeus (in my opinion the simplest of the series), but without the military or mythological aspects (the latter of which was a major component of Zeus).\n\nFor the most part, quality of life features hover between Zeus and Emperor levels. Buildings can be toggled off individualy, like emperor. Roadblocks exist to limit random walkers, but not emperor's more selective "smart" roadblocks. The one new feature, is that the walker range can be seen when a walker building is placed, which removes much of the guesswork from block design, a feature I wish I could port back to Emperor and Pharoah.\n\nIn Zeus, common housing requires one type of food, two types of goods (fleece and olive oil), and four services (wells, athletes, philosophers, and theatres), as well as healthcare, inspectors, taxmen, and police. In Lethis, common houses need two types of food, two types of goods (alcohol and utensils), and five services (wells, laundries, theatres, herbalists, and journalists), as well as exorcists (filling the role of healthcare), inspectors, and taxmen (no police). Elite housing arguably requires less than Zeus, only needing three types of food, two services (spas and cafes), and two goods (garments and jewelry). Compared to Emperor or Pharoah, housing has considerably reduced requirements, and setting up high-level housing blocks is comparatively simple.\n\nMuch like Zeus, housing and industrial blocks can be laid out anywhere, except for raw materials, which must be placed on appropriate resources (ore for mines, fertile land for farms, etc), meaning it's fairly trivial to lay out highly optimized blocks, and the map size and resource location is the only true limiting factor. Compare this to Emperor's Feng Shui mechanic, which greatly complicated city design, forcing the player to balance between placing industries in efficient locations, and placing them in auspicious locations.\n\nThe only major new mechanics that Lethis adds are the steam mechanic, and the automata, both of which feel somewhat underutilized. Steam acts similar to the resevoirs and aqueducts of Caesar III: steam extractors must be built on vents, and connected to the steam condenser via pipes. However, for the most part, once connected, the steam condenser simply acts like another raw material producer, creating steam capsules which must be delivered to other industries like any other good. Automaton factories must be connected to the steam network via pipes, but no other buildings appeared to need this. If this system were leaned on more, with more industries requiring a pipe connection to function, it would add a much-needed layer of complexity to the city-building, as well as reinforcing the steampunk aesthetic of the game.\n\nThe automata are required for elite housing, and in large numbers for monuments, but are similarly underutilized. An elite housing block only ever needs 2 automaton factories to produce all the workers it needs, so only monument missions need a large amount to function. If the game included military elements, automata would be a perfect fit. Alternatively they could be used in other industries.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I have difficulty recommending Lethis over its spirtitual predeccessors, at least at its full price. At $20, Lethis is priced equally to the bundle on GOG containing Caesar III, Pharoah, Zeus, and all expansions. While no digital copies of Emperor are available, I recently purchased a sealed-in-box copy on ebay for $15 (though the game often runs for $40+). For a player new to the series, Lethis may be a good option. Similarly, veterans of the series who haven't played in years many not be as dissapointed by the relative lack of complexity. However, people who are still playing Emperor and Pharoah regularly won't find the game particularly challenging.","June 26, 2015","false","6.0"," 319 of 375 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","319","375","4","8"

YET\nI really wanted (and tried hard) to like this game. However there are certain reasons that made me stop playing it.\n\nUnexpectedly quits quite often. Like every half an hour. And for such a small game it takes absurdly long to load on my ssd.\n\nUnlike any other city building games, houses downgrade at the speed of light and once it does, the rest follows because everything in the chain of production gets ♥♥♥♥ed up. You insta loose, game over. Or you try hard to get back up. I am going to give an example how this ruins a game, skip the next paragraph if you don't want to read it.\n\nLet's say a building has collapsed (you cannot imagine how often they collapse! And if you don't have a good memory, you won't even know what has collapsed because every ruin has the same texture). Imagine your 'well' has collapsed. This is a building you need for upgrading your houses to level 2. All your level 10 buildings (for which you had worked REALLY HARD  to build) will downgrade to level 1. This will have a HUGE impact on your population. Within seconds many people will leave your city. Your buildings will stop functioning because of worker shortage. You will try to save the moment by pausing the game. You have 2 options. You either go back to the autosave or if you are no quitter, you try.\nYou disable all production buildings 1-by-1 so that your workers will work at the service buildings. This is to ensure that your other houses won't downgrade too. If you had stocked all kinds of products that are needed by your people, this may work. (If you didn't, you better try the autosave because you are ♥♥♥♥ed.) So anyway, your houses will slowly upgrade, you will get your people back. After 20 minutes of trying hard, stress and anger; you get back to where you were. And as soon as you feel the joy of rescuing your city from going down, don't worry the game goes down. Quits unexpectedly. You reopen the game and use the autosave.\n\nThe 3rd reason is the 2nd reason again!! This is way too important guys. This game is about levelling up your buildings. You might play for 4 hours and loose all the progress because some delivery guy randomly decided to walk another road and the buildings on that street couldn't get their laundry done, just for ONCE.  They will punish you for it. They will abandon your settlement. You can have 40% unemployment and they will keep coming to the city. But if they can't get what they need just for once. Oh they are on their way out bro..\nThis game could be really fun to play and I would have recommended it if these problems didn't exist. After hours of stubbornly trying to make the game work, I am giving up. I won't be playing it anymore. I will track the updates and revise this review if they ever change things.\n\nPS Since most people are getting this wrong, I felt the need to add here that the main problem isn't the collapsing buildings, it's how fast the buildings level down as a response to the things happening. Collapse was just an example..\n\nUpdates to this Review\nDevs would like us to consider the game as early access, and they are promising updates (especially for crashes). And they have a list of known bugs.\n\nClicking on ruins now gives information on the building that collapsed.     I have to admit that this is the kind of a game I've missed a lot. I really enjoy the genre and the graphics are pleasent. I would change this review to recommended as soon as it really is recommendable\n\nIt's been said that many crashes have been fixed. I didn't have time to test the last patch (3rd of july) yet but the developers are working hard every day and pushing many updates. I am looking forward to change this review to recommended.  (After saying this I tried playing again and had a good run for about 30mins until the game crashed again unfortunately..)\nVERDICT:\nIt is your decision if you are up to a fight with the mechanics I have mentioned above. It is manegeable with a more conservative gameplay. You can develop your own strategies and beat the part of the mechanics that I personally dislike. However the game at its current state prohibits you from doing that. It crashes. A lot. Don't buy it before they fix it. It is really tempering when it crashes all the time.\n\nMy recommendation is add this game to your wishlist and check back often. Because the pace of updates is fast and I am looking forward to see this game become an awesome one real soon.","June 27, 2015","false","12.6"," 228 of 292 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","228","292","10","18"

I could tell you of the variety of buildings in the game with an absolute 'motherlode' of content that would have any fan of City Builders to dig up a copy of SimCity IV. However, that's not what made me really like this game. It was the aesthetic, the freaking epic soundtrack that immerses you in the eventually complicated webs of services, residential zones and beautification monuments. Your bustling city full of working citizens from supernatural exorcists to copper miners and shopkeepers. An artstyle that screams originality and further draws you in to this Steam Punk world of industrialized Urban centers. Faes sparkle in the woods outside your city, water pours from pipes jutting out of the edges of the known world while steam bellows from the chasms of magma bellow the surface. Life, though artificial, is mostly certainly alive here. And undoubtedly, that's the best feature I've found in my time with Lethis.\nNow that's not to say the game is perfect. You notice very quickly that the soundtrack is the most prevalent noise in the game as sound effects only cue when you click on buildings or citizens. It's eerie that so much activity is occuring in your city but you could hear a pin drop if the music was muted. Personally, I would've appreciated there to be voice actors in the game... not annoying voices that talk every five seconds but rather, Pharaoh's approach or Stronghold where citizens would recite lines of how well their lives are going in game. A minor request, for sure, but it sure would bring a human element to this otherwise lively, bustling world.\nAll in all, this game is well worth 20 bucks and I can see myself pouring dozens if not hundreds of hours into perfecting my little Victorianesque Steam Punk cities.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGInM34Zk9A","June 26, 2015","true","12.3"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","67","77","9","7"

At all.\n\nPROS:\n- It looks amazing. The style is really cute, the animations are well done and the details are charming. Most walkers come in both genders which is a nice touch.\n\n- The interface is much better than the Impressions games, aesthetically and in terms of layout. Showing the range of all walkers is really, really helpful in planning the city.\n\n- It plays just like Impressions City Building Series.\n\nCONS:\n- It plays almost EXACTLY like Impressions City Building Series. I guess you can't do much wrong when you copy a good game (series). But aside from one or two production chains, you have to admit, it's really just a clone with a different skin. It’s actually easier than some of its spiritual predecessors.\n\n- Steam should have played a bigger part. This is the only thing that's different from the Impressions games and there should be many more buildings that need steam. It would be a big step to set Lethis apart from the games it copies. Same with automatons. So much potential wasted…\n\n- The statistics are only accessible when you build a town-hall, much like Banished did it, which is mostly okay. But worker distribution priorities should not be accessible through a window that’s only available when a certain building has workers. If you set the administration priority too low, your town-hall will stop working and you suddenly lose access to that window and then you have to deactivate your entire economy manually just so your town-hall has enough workers and you can change things back.\n\n- The game does not warn you when you are about to quit the session and it doesn’t remind you of saving. If you click quit and you haven’t saved you will lose all your progress. Which is really irritating when you accidently clicked quit instead of resume.\n\n- What are those trees that I cannot remove? Not the unique looking ones, those are cool, but plain old trees that you simply cannot remove. What’s up with that, Triskell?\n\n- There should be more information about a building BEFORE you build it as it isn’t obvious what some of these buildings do. It would be nice if the tooltips showed more than just the price.\n\n- Tooltips are annoyingly slow.\n\nAs someone who played the Impressions City Building Series, this game had nothing new to me. The only things I had to figure out were steam and automatons, which are both nice ideas but not developed enough, in my opinion.\n\nStill recommending this game because it’s fun and gorgeous. But sadly, nothing new.","July 20, 2015","true","6.7"," 55 of 59 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","55","59","3","0"

I've been playing sim and city-building games since the DOS-age and have really been yearning for a non-casual reboot of 2D games of this genre.  As soon as I saw Lethis, I knew I had to buy it.  I also asked the developer if they were planning on having official support for mods, but they said no.\n\nMy thoughts so far is that this game is pretty enjoyable, though it has a few glitches that need to be ironed out.  Here's my breakdown:\n\nART: Amazing, I can't say it enough. It's like a cross between Studio Ghibli and Breath of Fire III.  The steampunk aesthetic is also awesome. The sound is also great, with a score that is soothing and optimistic.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Pretty solid from the perspective of someone who loved games like Pharoah, Caesar, etc.  However, from a modern perspective, the game -- particularly the sandbox mode -- could need some added depth.   The systems make sense and are consistent, and I love the roadblock mechanic.  However, there aren't certain options that should be in the game.  For example, in sandbox mode, you apparently can't choose your starting amount of florins (gold), nor can you choose the size of the map or any world generation options.\n\nYou also don't appear to have any neighbors in sandbox mode and therefore can't trade.  This is highly detrimental and takes out a fun part of the game.  Sandbox just plain needs more options.  These, I imagine, might be patched in later.\n\nThe game is easy to pick up once you understand the roadblock mechanic and how it interacts with services.  You will quickly, however, find yourself running out of space.\n\nThe game also needs some polish on its localization in English, as some minor things are still untranslated.  Triskell Interactive could actually make this a feature of the game and teach us all a little French along the way with some larger, more robust tooltips or an ingame encyclopedia.  These would also be welcome considering the game does not have an easy way of telling you exactly what a building does before you build it.  Presumably you encounter the buildings during the tutorial, but I got bored of doing them after the fourth one.\n\nPERFORMANCE:  Game runs like a dream most of the time, but I've run into a couple of freezes/crashes when Alt+Tabbing.  Also, if you load into a map and the actual "world" doesn't generate, you're just going to have to restart your game.  That usually fixes it.  Fortunately, the game is quick to load.\n\nOVERALL:  I'll give this game an overall positive rating.  It's got a little ways to go to be a great game, but the base of it is really solid.  I know I'll get several hours of play out of it.  If they add formal support for modding, this game could actually be really great.\n\nSee my gameplay vid if you're undecided or having trouble with the game.  I go over the basics in it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/a9LEdkHcYKM","June 26, 2015","true","4.0"," 63 of 79 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","63","79","0","0"

Figured this one might end up the same way, but thankfully it hasn't.\nI'm really, really enjoying this game so far.\nThe art is wonderful; the designs are charming and eye-catching, very creative, especially the characters, and I'm really liking all the detail put into everything. And the music! It's very light-hearted and fun, but it's also very fitting and not at all distracting. I thought the little details - the use of the French Republican Calendar, the references, sound effects, etc.- were all pretty neat, too, and personally I think stuff like that makes the game even more fun, makes it more appealing when there's extra stuff to catch your attention.\n\nI thought the tutorial, for the most part, was easy enough to follow and helped me understand the game much better -isn't that what a good tutorial is meant to do, though?-, especially as someone who has never played any city builders before. There was some stuff I struggled to understand at first, particularly in the last two chapters of the tutorial, and some parts seemed to progress a little slower than I'd have liked, but maybe that was just me being a novice, ha! I do wish I could have had a way to repeat some of the instructional dialogue, but maybe there is and I just missed it? If not, it'd be nice to have that just in case someone else is like me and clicks too fast.\n\nThere were a few minor problems I had, but nothing major at all. The game crashed a few times on my older laptop, but once I put it on the newer one it's worked just fine so far. It seems to freeze when you select certain options (loading a chapter or a saved file, etc.), but then it works just fine after. Not a problem, but it can get just a little annoying. So far, I haven't had any problems in-game, just a few minor annoyances mostly related to me just being impatient or not understanding something clearly enough.\nIt's been pointed out before, but there could also be a bit more proof-reading with the translation. Personally, I didn't find the errors that bothersome or noticeable, but it did sometimes make it a little difficult to properly understand the instructions they gave you, especially during the latter half of the tutorial. I also didn't mind the few stray bits of text that were left in French.\n\nThere are things that could be fixed or improved, sure -and the team is working on it, this game is frequently updated!-, and some parts are a little slow, at least, for me, but I'm not used to the pacing of city builders, yet. But, the art style is great, the game is very colorful and visually appealing, the text -even if it's not quite translated right-, is charming and to me it seems pretty fitting to the era the game is supposed to be in. Some of the tasks are fun and challenging, and I like that little rush I get when I've done something right, even more-so when I'm rewarded with a nifty little achievement!\nI also really, really appreciate the fact that the game's creators are very involved in the discussions and forums, that they answer all your questions and critiques honestly and are willing to listen to complaints and find ways to solve them. From the looks of it, it seems like they're working really hard to get all the bugs and kinks worked out, translation errors included. :>\n\nIt's my first real adventure into a city builder game, and so far I'm really starting to like the genre. I'd definitely recommend Lethis, especially once it's gotten most of the bugs smoothed out.\n\n\n\n","June 29, 2015","true","8.3"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","0"

There is no background sound yet, but Devs said that will be added soon, so I might update the review\n\nInterface: Most of the interface is intuitive, there is tabs for each production chain and services. There is also graphics and most of the time you dont need many clicks to get what you want to see.\n\nTutorial: Its good enough for teaching the basics BUT it does not provide players in depth explanation to some core important aspects of the games and how to use it - Walkers and roadblocks.\n\nOveral gameplay: The game is fun, no doubt of that. There is no combat (donno if there will be) but the management city building thingy is good and can be challenging in Hard mode. There is a happiness system that takes place and its important to the city. If taxes are too high and payment too low they will riot, no food they leave etc etc..\n\nCORE Mechanics:\nProduction: If you need cooper, you need to build cooper mine right? If you need potato, build a potato farm. That is the basic production. The citzens have needs for food, drinks and services like theater, papernews kiosk etc. The production is intuitive and easy. To make bread you going to need to build a wheat farm, then a Wildmill and finally a bakery. There is plenty of resources to explore and a Steam system that is quite nice and fit the steampunk nature of the game\n\nDelivery: After the production, your citzens are going to need buildings to deliver the goods to them. A shop will deliver food and drinks. The storehouse will deliver the goods needed to the production facilitys. The delivery system is a core mechanic because if you place buildings far from the material needed it will decrease the production because of the time the walker needs to get there.\n\nWalkers: Its the old impression game style of city building mechanic. Each service or production building has a Walker (little person who walks arround the city) to delivery the services/goods to the houses. When they pass in front of the house, the service is provided and the walker need to constant pass that location from time to time to deliver the service again or the house will no longer get the service.\n\nRoadblock: This is one of the most important little thing that you need to understand. This will block the passage of the walker, so you limit the area that the walker will deliver the service. When you do that, you start to see that you need to use this often so you can create neighbourhoods with all the services. The roadblock only block the walkers to go to another area to provide the service, it will not block the walker from taking any goods that he needs to provide the service to the houses. Example: Shop/food walker wont pass the roadblock to delvier food but will pass the roadblock to pick up food from the granary.\n\nUpdrading Houses: There is 10 lvls of houses. Each lvl demands a type of good to be delivered so the house can lvl up to the next lvl. That is why sometimes you going to need 2 types of food for example, or you going to need garments for elite houses, or alchool etc etc.Each lvl can acomodate more people and generate more taxes for you :)\n\nThis game has a campaing and a sandbox mode. Both are fun in their own ways.\nI recomend the game, ITS ADCTING. If  you played old impression games you will be at home.\nIF not, you can play one of the most adcting city builders that is.","July 6, 2015","true","20.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

If you have played any of those games before, you will feel immediately hat home: The gameplay is basically the same, build places for houses and buildings to satisfy the inhabitants' needs. Workes patrol the streets and refresh stocks of food, bring them water or exorcise ghosts from the houses. Upperclass citizens life in masions and to not interact with the common folk but steam-powered automatons instead.\nIndustry is pretty standard with rather short production chains, the classic farm-mill-bakery is one of the longest. Steam is a special ressource, as some buildings require direct connection to steam pipes, while others use it bottled. Excess ressoures can be traded with other cities.\nThe game is very competend at what is does, which is building a city. It lacks advanced mechanics like a military or others, like the pan-hellenic games in Zeus. After about half of the 26-mission campaign I felt like i saw everything, there were no new buildings and the mission goals are reather similar: build a city with x citizens in houses of level y, build a monument, gather z amout of ressources. Since you have to start with an empty map everytime makes the early stages rather boring after a while. The game is in general very relaxed, as there are no timelimits in any mission.\nTHe Story is somewhat forgettable and only told in text messages. The gaphics is very nice, very detailled 2d comic graphics with exceptionally detailed animations. The music is fitting and somewhat whimsical, strengthening the relaxed and not to serios athmosphere of the game.\nNontheless, it is a good game since the developers focused on the aspect of building a city which the games does well. I hope they take this good foundation and build a sequel with more  advanced mechanics, keeping the motivation up  in later stages of the game.","August 22, 2015","true","57.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

The art alone throughout this game is so aesthetically pleasing and wonderful to look at that you’ll play this game solely to experience it. That said, there are multiple other reasons why you’ll play this game. It has a magical soundtrack that will get you singing along for days on end while somehow not ever managing to get sick of it and the game-play is quite addictive itself. There’s even a sandbox mode for you to build the city of your dreams!\n\nThe game-play requires you to meet a goal before you can pass a level. Essentially, you’re trying to keep your citizens happy by supplying them with food, water, bathing houses, utensils, culture and medicine. You must build farms, neighborhoods, factories, storage buildings and pay for these with the taxes that you collect from your citizens. If your city becomes developed enough, you can build mansions and shops for the upper class. However, the upper citizens refuse to be served by real humans, so you’ll need to build entirely new factories to build automations, and to build those factories you’ll need more middle class, and for more middle class you’ll need more food! It’s very fun to juggle all of these factors and just scrape past into a win. As you fulfill your citizens needs and wants you’ll level up the buildings that they live in and increase the amount of citizens that can live in them and it’s one of the most satisfying feelings in game. Be careful though, you’ll need to make sure you don’t move in too many people at once or the demand will be less than the supply!\n\nThe game-play seems to last forever and there is a steep difficulty curve. Whether or not that is a positive for you, it is something to consider. Personally, I loved that it challenged me and wasn’t as easy as many other city management games. There was no hand-holding or obvious hints or tips and the game leaves the player to figure it out themselves. I spent maybe three hours and countless resets trying to get past the first tutorial level. However, once you get the hang of the game it becomes very easy as the later levels do not introduce any new game play tactics.\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of city management strategy games. I would also recommend this game to everyone else as the art style and soundtrack is next level awesome.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","October 30, 2015","true","26.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","29","36","3","3"

Every time I start playing a new level I experience at least one crash to desktop. The last city I spent two hours creating now crashes to desktop every 2-5 minutes after reloading, I can't progress and need to restart my city, however, I'm not confident the new one I create won't experience the same problem.\n\nFor such a small game it takes forever to load on my SSD, I don't understand why the load times are so gargantuan.\n\nI've also experienced buildings just randomly collasping. Apparently this should only happen if they're not being serviced or if homes aren't near a well, however, I've seen homes that were between a well and service building collapse, resulting in the entire level 10 block downgrading to level 1 or collasping as well, at which point you need to shut down your entire industry and slowly turn buildings on as the population recovers.\n\nIt's a fun, charming game, however, long load times, frequent crashes to desktop and random buildings collapsing just sucks the life out of the game. If these problems are patched out I would highly recommend the game, but in its current state it's too frustrating to play through.","June 27, 2015","false","7.7"," 68 of 104 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","68","104","2","0"

Suitable both for old and young players (so don't be distracted by fancy graphics, there is something inside there, seriously).\n\nThe gameplay.\nThere's nothing new here since Ceasar 3 and Pharaoh. The very same good old mechanics. You place buildings, people are hired by these buildings and the buildings provide services. Road connections influence everything. Build and prosper. Or loose some basic material/service in the supply chain and have everyone abandon the city. I think they should add more ideas here. At least add railroads and adjust the agent's behaviour, increase the difficulty with trading. However, these old ideas still work and I've enjoyed them much.\n\nThe style and graphics\nThis is the most important part of the game. We've played this game togheter with my wife since she found the animations, decorations and style to be very cute. That is great since she never played any strategy game before! =)\n\nThe music\nMusic is nice. However, the soundtrack is not very long.\n\nThe crashes\nThe game crashed a few times. Also when I hit alt+tab the music stops. I think this is due to the reason they have only two developers in the team... However, I see nothing criminal here. Works fine.\n\nAs a conclusion.. I've played a lot in Ceasar 3 and Pharaoh, Cleopatra. This game is not so balanced, nothing new in terms of gameplay. However, it does a great job as a modern clone of these city builders and looks like it could be interesting not only for the old gamers like me.","December 6, 2015","true","10.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warfaced23/recommended/359230/","warfaced23","warfaced","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warfaced23/","276 products in account","I'd like to preface this by saying this is a very good game despite having several flaws and balancing issues, which I want to outline below. The art style and animations are gorgeous, there are a lot of cool production chains, and it pretty much covers what you'd expect from a Zeus/Caesar/Pharoah type game except built for modern platforms.\n\nConcerns & Issues:\n- I've experienced a crash-to-desktop once so far midway through the first mission of the campaign. This issue may have been fixed with the most recent patch, but I haven't yet tested to be sure.\n- Tutorial messages don't come back once closed. Not sure if there is a way to re-open the most recent instruction. If there is, I didn't see it or it wasn't obvious to me.\n- Import/Export prices are way too low imo. Building complex production chains to try to make a global profit is chump change compared to taxes for most goods (4190 in taxes vs 312 for exporting maximum bread). Adding up the wages (1 pop at 2 coins at the normal salary, the total cost to make bread comes out to around 20 coins per 100 and sells for 17 coins per 100 (which should come out to 544 (17 * 32) but displays as 312 on the balance screen for some reason?!?! Still very low). Why would I ever sell bread to the outside world for less than it costs to make it? On top of the capital investments & space usage in infrastructure and the trade route opening cost? Maybe I'm not doing it right, but it seems to me that the better way to play the game is to be tax-focused, produce the minimum amount necessary to sustain the pop, and use trade only to get goods you can't get otherwise at the moment.\n- Many aspects of the game are not explained and can be inherently confusing. i.e. Despite using "Keep", which I assume is supposed to retain a quanity of a good up to a certain amount (maybe?), stuff still seems to get taken from my reserves. Does "Get" interfere with the regular distribution of goods to houses? I don't feel I have a sense of control over what aspects of my economy get exported/imported, what get used by the populace, what get used for production, and what get stored in reserve. Having more control over that would be useful. Having statistics on production/consumption of items by raw material usage, exporting/importing, population usage, etc. would be dope as well. Finding buildings associated with a production chain can be a little difficult to pin down if you don't already know what and where they are in the menus.\n\nIt's fun as-is insofar, but I fear that I'm going to run into more stability issues as I go along. You may want to wait for an update to adress some of these issues, and issues that others are having.\n\nEdit: An update has now been released that addresses some of these issues. The above has been corrected to account for these changes, removing the translation errors and the tribute not saving issue.","June 26, 2015","true","6.7"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

It's beautiful! The art direction is fantastic, the style is really appealing and especially the animations are stunning - The little foxes hiding behind trees, the faes around the mushrooms, the steam condensor, even the dust whirling around once you build something.\nIt's full of life everywhere. Each time you look at something, it moves and you can't stop examining every little detail.\nAnd I really love steampunk! The music is really good as well, it's uplifting and fitting the game perfectly! Even though there are some sounds missing still, many of them made me laught , especially the ranch's sound!\n\nBut let's talk about gameplay. I like it, it's cool and you have plenty to do – there's always something to build or to improve. You can spend hours building your perfect city, and optimizing your layout. You have many possibilities, there are 5 kinds of food, there even are wonders as for example in Pharaon at the time.\n\nAlso, each population has it's own needs, the rich people want jewellery, the poor want cutlery, everybody loving production chains will be satisfied (Raw materials, stockage, transformation, distribution and so on). You feel the game was inspired by Sierra's titles, and the building layouts are similar: maintenance is superimportant, and there even are ghosts! You need to carefully plan your cities, because one loose joint may make everything very difficult. So, there really is always something to do!\n\nOn a technical standpoint, the game is fine. You can always look at stastistics via that little eye button, or the full one, once you've built a townhall. They come in handy for people that want to build THE perfect city, but you do not absolutely have to look at it to win the game.\n\nAnd  finally, I love the little annotations and the humour! There is a short text for every building or person, often with some pop-references that are genuinely funny.\n\nReally, get it! Really! The content is amazing compared to for example Banished, where you only have 3 things to do in like 10 hours. Since they both cost the same, and the programmers will patch add new content to Lethis, this game has the potential to become gigantic!\n\nP.S: For all people who experienced bugs, I haven't encountered a single one yet, perhaps they have been fixed already. And as I've seen so many people raging about the chipset stuff: Why didn't you just read the requirements section on the Steam store page? There's no point in complaining, if you simply did not read them!","June 29, 2015","true","19.6"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

The most impressive feature of the game are male and female workers for most of the human buildings.

There doesn't seem to be a hostile element in this game however (no barbarians or enemies otherwise) I'm not sure about natural disasters yet (someone feel free to chime in)\n\nI completed all tutorials and the first campaign mission so far and only ran into some minor problems. I can list a few pros and cons to help others deciding on picking the game up or not.\n\nPros:\n\n- The graphic style is very reminiscent of older city builder games.\n- Decent mechanics (can put down roadblocks to prevent certain distributors from travelling excess amount of roads)\n- Great tutorials imo, it's explained pretty clearly what most buildings do and such.\n- I really love the overlays. You can easily see what distributors go where and if you might need to put down more buildings to fill the citizen's needs.\n- The dev-team is actually very involved with the game. There are a few issues atm and they seem to take those very serious, along with bug fixing being their priority.\n\nCons:\n\n- Does have some bugs. I ran into one map that wouldn't load for me (stayed blue) rebooting the game solved the issue though. I also had a runtime error that crashed my game to the desktop once.\n- Unclear in some aspects, I think the game could benefit from having a small in-game encyclopedia that explains what buildings needs maintenance, etc, because memorizing it seems a bit much to ask. Also there are icons of various materials in game and it's not immediately clear what they are, and hovering over them doesn't work in every screen.\n- Music can get a bit repetitive.\n- Not much random events (correct me if wrong)\n\nYou can see the developers put a lot of love and work into the game though, and just before I posted this they put up a patch to fix some of the bugs and issues, so I applaud that effort. It's one of the reasons I'm recommending the game right now, just be aware there are still some issues with the game (one of them is the fact it won't run on Intell integrated grahics cards)","June 26, 2015","true","21.3"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

In truth, I have not been looking for another city-builder for some time. I still have my old standbys such as Ceaser 3, Stronghold, Space Colony, etc. Mind you that doesn't mean that I havent longed for something in that venue. I have always had a love of them and when a buddy of mine mentioned this I was immediatly impressed. I watched the video and then I hesitated.\n\nWas this game going to be good? Was this going to just be me looking at it with rose-tinted glasses? Am I Elton John? But seriously, was this going to be the game that would be a return to the classics? Yes and no. To be fair this game is a gem. I feel that this game is trying to revive that old-school feel that us older gamers had the pleasure to experiance in the late 90's early 2000's. However, it does something by itself that I feel is more than just a supposed "pallet-swap".\n\nIt has character, its own character in itself. Like all the Impression games of the past, you play a person that is in charge of settlement, you obtain quests and stuff, and then you win. Unlike the old titles, this game is not set in antiquity. No this game is allowed to follow in its own footsteps without being restricted to reality.\n\n"Can't make beer here! Use the Fae! Get the hunter to use a netgun to capture them and then squish them to make some!"\n\nThat is just one of the things that I got a chuckle out of. There are many more things in this game that will make you chuckle for just how absurd it is, but at the end of the day I see it doing that kinda absurd right.\n\nIn final thought, this game stands on its own. It might not be side-by-side with its counterparts, but it is far from being caught in the shadows. The only thing that I find that I can complain about is like with all games of this type. This is not for the generation that as born with a copy of COD in its hand. This is that kinda "Dad Game", something thats fun, relaxing, and not having to deal with people screaming "Noob" or "Pwnd" or other dumb dribble on another game.\n\nHats of to the developers for making a fun game, I hope to see more in the future!","July 22, 2015","true","7.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","1"

A very nice art style and plays similarly to the Zeus and Pharoah games of old. The main mechanic is the "walker" system, whereby you place a supply building, such as a well, which then generates walkers" to supply your houses with water. This works fine with the correct types of town layouts, but not with road system that have many junctions, etc, as the "walkers" have no intelligence when it comes to their deliveries, means certain streets can go months without being supplied under the right/wrong conditions.\n\nGreat fun if you played similar games in the past and want to try an up-to-date version and you can remember how towns had to be built in those types of games. Not quite as special as Zeus or Pharoah though in my opinion, nothing yet as interesting as the religious systems/buildings in those games, though it might become more interesting later on in the game.","July 19, 2015","true","3.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Although instead of just rehashing those old games this game has a twist of its own. The steampunk idea adds some flavor to it, as does some of the ways you have to evolve the housing system. I picked this up for $10 and I would easily spend more, and plenty more on any DLC they have to enhance the gameplay of this in anyway. I'm on the 8th mission out of 26, plus theres an open sandbox. Since I got the game a few of the issues I had were addressed in the latest patch (sandbox mode not having any form of trade).\n\n10/10 An excellent game for its price, and I will continue to finish off all of the campaign missions. It's good to see someone is making these kinds of games with a real eye for detail and balance. If you're finding the game a bit easy, turn it on hard which I didn't notice at first is just at tab at the top.

There is an upbeat vibe to the game, tinged with an air of excitement and apprehension as a civilisation experiments with amazing steampunk discoveries. The soundtrack's engaging and the art is appealing.\n\nThere are one or two qurks about the interface, for example the query selector is the left-click instead of right, which will seem odd to many players, but it's generally functional enough when you get used to it. Trade and storage - always the meat of a game like this - seem clear enough, although I was disappointed that you can't seem to set minimum and maximum levels for goods in storage when importing and exporting, as you do in some of the previous games.\n\nThere's no combat that I've noticed, which isn't really a problem - usually it's little more than an afterthought in these games anyway. I'd wager most builder players won't miss it.\n\nThe campaign maps, while I haven't played very far in, seem to be both balanced and interesting, and the length - 26 - is long enough to provide plenty of entertainment.\n\nGlad I got this, and would definitely recommended to people who enjoy city building games.","September 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

So you can skip the tutorial, which is good because it's annoying.\n\nThe same game mechanics of buildings housing to attract immigrants, plunking down buildings that spawn "walkers" to provide services to the houses, which make the houses level up, building farms and buildings to move raw materials along a chain. The one improvement over the Impressions games is they just dropped combat altogether, which was always the worst part of those games anyhow.\n\nGraphically it's prettier, of course. IT has a hand-drawn look. Steam page says it's Steampunk, but think cheerful Studio Ghibli-ish steampunk, not the grittier kind so in vogue these days. The music helps sustain the Ghibli vibe, and in some ways is more surprising than the game itself.\n\nIts a French game, and the English translation is amateurish but at times hilarious. I still don't know what to make of the game promising to "reward you portly" for successfully completing the first mission.  (You will be rewarded so much you'll become portly? You'll be rewarded with a cask of port? Je ne sais pas.)\n\nSo it's very much a sort of tribute to that style of city builder, which has largely been replaced by more sophisticated games. You can't, for example, delve down into your population and see what individuals are up to, it's just a numbers game of balancing your population (you need enough to get your buildings to function, but too many and the unemployment will cause problems.) There are few small innovations--creating a network of steam extractors, for example--but for the most part the strategy is the same.\n\nSO, though I like the game, and enjoy the aesthetics it brings, I can't recommend it for everyone, or even for all city builder enthusiasts. It's a very specific kind of city builder. If you liked Pharaoh or Zeus, then you will probably like Lethis, But I can't really say whether you'll like it more, or whether it brings enough new to the game to justify the purchase. Especially when you can still get ahold of those Impressions games from gog.","July 11, 2015","false","7.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

More specifically, it appears he thinks the downgrading of the houses is a big problem.\n\nAfter I've read his review and watched a few let's plays on Youtube, I've bought the game and tried it by myself. I found that the downgrading of houses is very much avoidable with proper planning. It happened to me a few times that all houses downgraded. Once, I restarted the scenario, a different time I supplied the nessesary product and everything went up again - and I'd say, upgrading the houses was rather quickly. But most importantly, every time I knew why the houses downgraded and could avoid their downgrading afterwards. I did however carefully read the tutorial messages, which I recommend you do too.\n\nAnother issue is the game crashing. It happened about four times so far (with 14 hours of gameplay) and with the frequent auto saving, not much was lost. I don't like it, but it's okay.\n\nOverall, I think the game is well worth your time and money if you like games like Pharao (didn't play this for a very long time) or the Anno series.","July 8, 2015","true","14.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/niyoru/recommended/359230/","niyoru","Wintersand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/niyoru/","798 products in account","Okay. Let's begin the review. This is a honest summary of my experience so far with Lethis.\n\n1) Gameplay\n\nThe game plays like a city builder should. You construct your city in whatever manner you seem fitting, you rotate buildings, you position infrastructure and decoration as you wish to.  There are bugs, but i will let them slide as this is the teams first title and most importantly, a fairly decent experience that they are willing to improve upon.\n\nIt seems like it might get very advanced and have a greater sense of depth to it. I am only 4 hours or so in however, but i have witnessed the ability to grow my cities by levelling up the housing for families (which requires me to provide for their cares, be it alcohol, washing facilities, food supplies or jobs). There is also maintanence, which means buildings can collapse unless you have a maintanence man checking in on them regularly. This is just a small part of the picture, you can build a lot of cool things to play around with.\n\nThere is a lot of intricacy, certain buildings require certain resources to run properly which means developing a well thought out road structure so your stockpiles of resources get distributed to the proper places.\n\ni am sure a lot more will be coming.\n\n2) Graphics\n\nOh the graphics. They are awesome. At a glance it looks pixel, zoom out all the way and it looks like im playing sim city or OTTD with a steampunk theme (which is fine, by the way) but then I found out i can zoom in all the way and look at what everybody in my city is doing.\n\nThats right. EVERYTHING is animated. I was amazed to watch the fishery after catching a fish, a giant fish is inside the building and the fisherman cuts meat from the fish and places it on a table. Then, a worker from the storage facility arrives and takes the fish in his cart (which is animated) to the facility and wham, now I can see fish stored in the crates. Your workers move to and fro, when a building is fully staffed there are animations and effects that play but its not just buildings. Environment is also animated!\n\nBuild a flower garden, watch as butterflys take up home. Build trees, and see birds flying about. In the wilderness itself, there are a combination of birds, foxes and rabbits if you look carefully enough they will peek out and dart around the map.\n\n3) Sound.\n\nThe game has a lovely musical track which is very fitting to the theme and pleasent to listen to. A lot of the buildings have little sound effects when near them and when you click on them, as does the scenery. This is a very nice touch and i hope they expand upon it.\n\nNow, the downsides:\n\n1) Bugs - There are a lot of bugs, i am told. So far I have only encountered a crashing problem, other than that none but the forums suggest there are many so we shall see.\n\n2) Interface - Its a little clunky at times, especially when rotating buildings. It's not always clear what side a building needs a road connected to function properly.\n\n3) No control over worker routes - Currently you have no control over your workers routes directly. Workers will go work where they wish to work, they will walk randomly about the city to their establishments and this does pose a problem with supply. If your shop is constantly picking up the wrong product and sending it out to the wrong place for instance, its very difficult to figure out how to get around that problem without moving the shop itself.\n\nYou can place roadblocks which stop workers from passing through, so perhaps creative use of roadblocks is going to be the way forwards past that.\n\n4) No control over workers in buildings - You simply have an on or off switch. You cannot assign workers to the buildings you wish them to go to. This currently forces you to construct more housing to fill any gaps. Not sure if this was intented or not.\n\n\nOverall?\n\nA great game that needs some more work. I highly reccomend supporting the dev team as it is currently playable and lovely to experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pcgneurotic/recommended/359230/","pcgneurotic","pcgneurotic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pcgneurotic/","483 products in account","As others will have noted here, this is a city-builder very much in the vein of the old Impressions Games' Caesar, Zeus et al. What that means is a grid-based isometric view (with 4-step rotation), with the city you build living and dying on whether or not certain key resources are supplied to all your homes by "Walkers" -- water deliveries, maintenance visits, etc.\n\nThe graphics are, to put it simply, lovely. Absolutely lovely. There is a very French aesthetic here, which reminds me most of The Little Prince, and my old Tintin books. You'll know it when you see it. What they're put to use doing is rendering a kind of 'Space 1889' Steampunk-Victoriana, with the Gaelic twist. Imagine Sim City 4 as drawn by Hergé or Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and you're in the right neighbourhood.\n\nThe gameplay is every bit as compelling as all the greats of the genre. I've played 4 of the 5 tutorials, and there's also a Sandbox mode and a Campaign mode. At 20 Euros it's well worth it, even more so if you can find it cheap in a sale (I got it a lot cheaper from the Humble Spring Sale 2016). As mentioned, it's a clear homage to the Zeus/Caesar school of city-building, with all kinds of necessary services that need to be set up and properly routed around your streets, plus a really nice, wide selection of resources that can be harvested, processed and turned into luxuries and other essentials. These can all be imported and exported (by hot air balloon!) via a World Map, giving the whole thing a little more life beyond your current town.\n\nSo far, so good. There are some flies in the ointment, though. Chief among these is the crash problem with nVidia GTX cards (I don't know if anything else is problematic in this way, but the forums here only really speak of GTXs). I have a GTX 750, and yes, I did experience this problem. However, there is a thread on the Discussion page/forum here on Steam that details how to resolve this. Since I followed its advice, I've had about 99% less problems. In fact, Lethis crashes on me LESS than Cities: Skylines does. Of course, technical problems are mostly subjective, but my point is that the negative reviews here that scream in capital letters about constant crashing should be taken with a *large* pinch of salt.\n\nThe other minor gripe I have is that with continued development, the story and text could be tightened up a bit. There seems to be some minor disparity between certain art and text elements and the actual mechanics of the game, such as the World Map showing a clearly continent-based map, and the actual in-game maps being a kind of bio-dome on an asteroid in space! It does look really cool though.\n\nAs an experienced city-builder, I love this game. I feel that it represents good value for money, possibly more so if you're like me. If not, I would probably have to recommend Clockwork Empires over Lethis, although this is somewhat like comparing a top-end BMW to a super Porsche. They both do the same job excellently well, but... :)","May 22","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like city building games, then just buy it already. Its not perfect but really enjoyable. You will not regret buying it. If you are still in doubt please continue reading to see if its for your or not.\n\nUpdate 1: (Reviewed)\nCompleted 10 missions now. Will probably try that last tutorial now that I know its trick. Its really easy once you get the hang of it. You must not rush building everything at once but balance the workforce and unemployment.  I leave it on x2 after 10 minutes into the mission and see that I always have above 6% unemployment, if not just build a neighbourhood of work houses. And never forget the maintenance. I make three rows of work houses, each row with 9 or 10 houses. Leave little space for each row for decorations like trees. The first to build is the maintenance and the well and when I have some food I build the shop. This way has never failed me in the 10 missions that I have completed up to now.\n\nWhat I love:\nGraphics especially the details. (Seeing a cat on the roof of the cafe)\nSeeing all the people doing their jobs.\nHouses being upgraded.\nNo bugs.\nMenus.\nSmooth gameplay.\n\nWhat I don't love:\nThe music. So not buying the soundtrack.\nAnnoying messages from the emperor.\nStory is boring.\nMissions can be a bit boring too.\nTutorials are terrible. They are harder than the actual missions and don't teach you anything important.\n\n\nUpdate 2:\nWhat I would like to see added or improved?\nHop farm, grape farm and Sugar cane farm.\nBuilding to make wine using the grape farm. Building can even be the abbey. Wine is essential.\nSweet shop using the sugar cane farm.\nMore workforce house types.\nMore rich people house types.\nAll buildings can be upgraded by the player, for example to make them more efficient.\nDifferent roads.\nMore decorations, tree and flower types.\nThe well should be upgraded. Also there should be another type of water source for the rich people. Like there is the emporium instead of the shop. Those beautiful mansions and palaces and then that ugly well? Even the maintenance shop should be different for the rich people.\n\nWill continue to update this after completing more missions and hope some cool stuff is added very soon.

I haven't found anything like it since... Until now.  I can bet that this game was actually modelled on Pharoah, and you know what? Kudos.  I love the Steampunk theme and the cute little graphics. I love the slight mystical twists that have been implemented (and who wouldn't love fairy rangers, and a fae pressing station to make absynth... I mean, really.  Someone must have given wayyy too much thought to where absynth comes from on one particular evening.)   I also love the fact that there is no COMBAT! Yay!  No marauding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s intent on ruining my well functioning town.  Don't get me wrong, there are some malicious political  intrigues here and there, but I am so happy I don't have to waste man power on armies!  If you haven't guessed by now, I absolutely recommend this game.\n\nNow on to some constructive criticism... (I can hear the devs muttering under their breaths already :P ) It's just a little.... simple.  The extent of the Steampunkedness (that's a word.  Trust me) is limited.  There is SO MUCH that you could do with this!  It annoys me that it's integral to a small part of the game only.  I would love to be able to expand trading routes.  And IF  there was a possibility to build maybe a zeppelin it would be a great opener to something like that, dontchya think?  Industry needs a big expansion too.  Since the devs scrapped combat (did I mention YAY?) it'd be pretty awesome if they could stretch their Steampunky brains to come up with some other novel industries that the civilisation could depend on...  Maybe a clock maker, a cog-smith, some kind of luminescent lantern maker or some such?\n\nAlso, one final thing... It'd be great if service buildings, or admin buildings upgraded with the local houses.  They look so out of place amongst beautiful high end houses.\n\nIn summary... Love this game.  I would be in seventh heaven if the devs brought out an expansion pack for it.... Because, lets face it, it needs one.","January 12","true","139.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And this game is good. Immediatly when I started playing my mind started comparing it to the old games. But there are some really cool new concepts in this game. For example, instead of building a wheat farm and your wheat gets eaten directly by people like in the old games. In this one, you make wheat, convert it to flour, and then convert the flour to bread. And that is really nice. Of course there are still other types of food that can be eaten directly, but food that is processed like wheat feeds more people per unit than the other types. And you will find many materials in this game built on top of one another.\n\nAnd elite housing in this game can give you "representatives" which you can assign to trade routes so they would increase the value of your exports while decreasing the cost of your import. it can get to a point where you can import a certain material and then sell it back for a small profit. But taxation seems to be the main source of money in the game, especially taxing the elite houses.\n\nI do have a couple of suggestions, much of the time playing the game will be dedicated to allocating and deallocating workers(because as you begin, you will run into worker shortage) I hope there is a way to just turn off/on all buildings of a certain type instead of going through them one by one.\n\nAnd second, I would like to see some more details about houses/people with chariots, for instance how many units they carry, where are they going and how much tax has a house paid. Mainly the taxation things I want to see, because I have no idea what taxing an elite house is worth at every stage.\n\nAll in all, I like this game. And a big thumbs up to Triskell making such a good quality game as their first game with a small team.","September 26, 2015","true","28.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's definitely a different take on city building. More basic in some respects and more difficult in others.\nOn to the postives: It looks a lot better playing it than it does in the pictures in the store. The music is great, the characters are adorable, and the campaign is fun and challenging at times. Housing is almost set up like neighborhoods, with each neighborhood needing to be served by different services in an efficient manner. The use of roadblocks keeps these services running in small ecosystems and keeps things moving smoothly. It's fun to watch roads and buildings upgrade as you have more affluent citizens move in.\nThe cons: My biggest con so far is that even with having a proprietary card the game eventually crashed. I'm hoping that this is not a recurring thing, otherwise the game is useless. As for gameplay: the buildings are neat and well-designed but there only seems to be one or two designs for each home and once they all upgrade they sort of just look the same. The neighborhoods are a neat concept but it leads to your city looking a bit disjointed. If you try making the neighborhoods into any other shape than a rectangle, your services may become inefficient. You also HAVE to use roadblocks or your services will try to walk the whole city, or at least as far as they can go, which doesn't provide great service. It's not the best game if you are a person who loves aesthetics when city building. Also, there are two classes of citizens: the regular poor folk who grow into the middle class, and the super rich. This is fine, but also kind of annoying for a few reasons.\nOne, your workers (the poor) will grow into housing that basically looks like a brownstone and that's it. Nothing super fancy or neat looking. Secondly, the rich are available right from the beginning. While this is neat and can help you balance your checkbook more easily, there isn't really a sense of achievement in attaining them. They also have completely separate buildings from the workers, meaning you don't have to really coordinate or juggle supplies efficiently to achieve anything, and they don't leave completely when their needs aren't met.\nOverall, the game is good. I would recommend it to anyone fond of city-builders or resource management games. It's one of the easier games I've played in this genre. The art is good, the music is good, and the neighborhood concept is new and interesting. Anyone who is a fan of steampunk will at least like the art. That being said, the game does have a few shortfalls that may make it hard to keep replaying it, and those things might be the things that makes the game unique.","May 8","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wish the tutorial went more into more detail on the basic stuff you have to build in pretty much every city. Most annoying thing about the game is how little of an effect you have when one thing goes wrong. If you did so little as placed a well too far from some houses, you might have to start over because eventually all of those houses will downgrade, the citizens will leave-but wait that's not all. Now all the houses around it will find the area ugly and downgrade and leave, also leaving you with less workers to run the city, and it will spread until you have no one. Most of the time it's too difficult to turn things around. And no matter how many maintenence buildings I have I can't seem to catch a break, my steam condensor dies on me all the time.

While they might not be the first example that comes to mind when you think of strategy games, there’s a level of tact and awareness required when planning the development of an entire city. Just when I was beginning to lose hope (having realized my copy of Emperor was nowhere to be found last I was at my parents’ house, shedding one solemn man tear knowing it’ll be nigh impossible to find another working copy), I was happy to find Lethis – Path of Progress on Steam, a Victorian Steampunk city-builder that serves as an ample spiritual successor to this pantheon of mighty games.\n\nLethis kind of snuck up on me on Steam, having been introduced in that handy suggestion queue one evening, trying to deal with the couple extra bucks burning a hole in my wallet. I first stumbled upon Triskell Interactive‘s debut piece a few months back, immediately won over by their attention to detail in all aspects. From the beautiful art style reminiscent of a westernized Hayao Miyazaki (think Spirited Away) to the airy orchestral marches that accompany your reign as imperial city manager, Lethis is a peaceful city-builder whose 26 scenarios are as fun, challenging, and engaging as they are breathtaking to look at–which is quite a bit.","February 9","true","5.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It was steampunk and it sounded too good to be true.\n\nFast forward to the release - I've sunk almost 15 hours into the game and I really have no desire to continue. The struggle to succeed in the campaign is very real, and it's not that it's difficult - it's just unfair.\n\n1) The AI has no intelligence at all - which is okay and they've implemented road blocks to contain these 'walkers' that distrbute resources - but the townspeople's patience for these AI to make it to their home is almost nil. You will have masses of workers leaving your city at ALL times almost crippling your economy and upgraded homes. I realize this is part of the game - but you will need to make 2-3 of each building within a small radius to keep the people from leaving. EVEN THEN they will still leave from time to time because someone made 10 left turns and never made that 1 right turn down the road you needed.\n\n2) Maintenance on your buildings is pathetic. You will need at least 3 maintenance buildings for every little 'village' otherwise the entire place will collapse.\n\n3) The game plays much too fast. Everything happens quickly - your ecomony will destabalize within seconds from a mass exodus.\n\nI could go on but I've depressed myself thinking of what this game could be. Apparently the dev's are releasing updates. At the writing of this review it's not worth the money since the game is just too damn unfair - and the scenarios are almost unwinable.","July 1, 2015","false","12.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerg_x/recommended/359230/","Zerg_x","zerg_x","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerg_x/","195 products in account","I've been following this game for quite some time now, and if you don't want to read the rest of my post then here's my short answer: AMAZING!\n\nFor those of you who want to know a bit more Lethis - Path of Progress (LPoP) is a city builder game that draws inspiration from the classic Sierra city builders such as Ceaser 3, Pharaoh, Zeus and Emperor. Instead of an ancient, historical setting LPoP instead takes the fantasy route with a well-crafted Steampunk esthetic. You won't find random gears on hats or pistons used as belt buckles. Lethis keeps the punk modest and doesn't go to over board. The designs for buildings and people look and feel alive and believable while still remaining stylized. Everything feels easy on the eyes while still being able to tell you what is what and who is who.\n\nGameplay wise might be Lethis greatest point. Veterans of the old Sierra style builds should have no problem finding their way around the UI, map or building their metropolis while newbies should have no problem learning even the most complicated mechanics of the game, which just about everything is shown in the very hands on and in depth tutorial.\n\nAs I'm sure you have already guessed too, LPoP also has everyone’s favorite mechanic: WALKERS! (Or as they call them "randomers) Yes, civic builds like wells, shops and tax collectors send out people to wander your city to make sure everyone is well fed, healthy, not cursed or being haunted by ghosts, entertained and all paid up and to make sure they don't stray off to far even road blocks are in the game. You can even click on randomers for a greatly detailed portrait, complete with what they do and even banter that reflects the current need of your city. And as an added bonus of detail all randomers also have both male and female models, each one with their own unique look to add extra variety to the people who walk the streets.\n\nProduction is also what you would expect from games like Zeus and Pharaoh. Farms, ranches, mines and more are in the game with over 40 different items to make, consume and even trade.(Yes, there is even trade, complete with an entire map for you to look at and make deals!) but this This is where a new twist on a slightly familiar mechanic comes in: Steam. Can't really have a steam punk game without the steam now can we?\n\nSteam productions works a bit similar to both your regular industry and the aqueducts system of Ceaser 3. Special steam geysers are dotted in the map that you can build extractors on. Then you must build pipes to a singular steam holder. This is where it gets kind of odd since the steam holder can make both vials of steam that can be sold, traded and even be carried to certain buildings while a few other buildings much be hooked up to the pipe directly. By a few buildings I mean a few, only 2-3 buildings need to be directly hooked up to the steam pipe while the Spa and a couple other need the vials of steam.\n\nAnd it is at this point where I start listing off the negatives. The steam pipe system is fun and unique but badly handled. It doesn't really make sense to build a pipe system at all when half of the steam is put in to vials. To add to that it makes even less sense that only a few buildings need to be hooked up directly to the pipes while others don't. If you can just put steam in to vials to throw wherever why make an entire pipe system!? Especially since two steam geysers make A LOT steam vials. A mechanic that could have been fun and set up just like Ceaser 3 only teases us of what could have been.\n\nThe second major thing is that there is no combat. A game that claims to be filled with ghosts, robots, and set in the industrial age where low wages, poverty, grueling work days and zero worker rights you would think there would be some conflict. We don't even get a police station! A steampunk world where everyone i just happy and fine? Guess someone stopped reading at the part where air pirates come in. This to me is the most disappointing. Combat in the Sierra games was simple and handled really well, and it's a shame we do not get to make armies of musketeers, zeppelin bombers or towering clockwerk men to conquer villages and destroy out enemies.\n\nTo add to this there is also no map editor either, a staple for all Sierra building games. While it does have a sandbox mode it only has one map to choose from.\n\nFinal nit picks and notes is that there is no voice acting for the randomers. While you can see that have a lot of personality it sure would be nice to have that cheesy voice work like the games used to have.\n\nGame also has some odd lag issues. I have a town of 200 people and it has this odd jumping lag that happens every second. This game is not very demanding so it's odd that it would be unstable, especially with such a small population, but it is still very playable and I have not encountered any other bugs or miss haps besides of bleh animations and the trade balloon on the wrong (NOTE as I was writing this I got a pop up too from the LPoP steam saying that bug fixes are coming later today)\n\nEven with ending on a smoggy note, I cannot wait to see how the game also progresses and how the team plans to expand this gem. It is not every day, especially now more so than ever that an indie dev that lives up to the promises of both a fun game that sticks to its roots while adds something new while also looking visually stunning. If you love the classics of Zeus and Ceaser, or just building in general, this game is top notch.\n\nLethis - Path or Progress lives up to its promises of an addicting, solid city builder game in the style of the classic Sierra Impression Game's series.","June 26, 2015","true","43.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There are way too many low-cost game engines on the market to be building your own w/ limited hardware support.\n\nAbout the only positive thing I can say about the game is the audio that is present is nice and the graphics are nice.\n\nWhen some storage buildings fill up, such as the warehouse or grainery, the game behaves as if there are no supplies anymore. So you can have a successful town that suddenly aggressively downgrades because of this bug.\n\nThe developers have now come forward and said they shouldn't have released and that they are sorry for all of the bugs. It's time to put their money where their mouth is and pull the game from Steam and either re-release as an early access at a reasonable price point or just pull the game all together until it is ready. Otherwise they are just being shady.\n\nThis game is not worth the price point.

Appealing aesthetics.  This is reminiscent (positively) of SimCity 2000 in its tile work and mechanics thus far.  When it's beyond Early Access I suspect it'll be very nice.  However at this very moment, there are a number of issues plaguing it.\n\n1)  The crashing is incredible.  Click the wrong box and it'll crash.  Change options and it'll crash.  Complete the tutorial and it'll crash.  Breathe on it funny, and it'll crash.  Early access is one thing.  Non-functional is another.  I'd wait a little longer on this one as it's not done baking.\n\n2)  Localization in English is awkward.  Probably need two or three more passes at the text and smoothing the tutorial a bit as while the mechanics aren't wholly foreign (especially to SimCity 2k folks) there are some nuances that aren't explained really well (which NPCs will go through roadblocks, which won't, which buildings will behave like this and which ones won't.\n\n3)  Reaction time to disasters is pretty extreme.  Rubble might need some identifying marks or the game have some mechanism to display what building type was on the plot.  Buildings going into decay based on a building not working SHOULD happen, but not quite so FAST.  Again with a SC2K comparison, say a water source fails, the buildings don't go into immediate decline, it takes months, giving the player time to rebuild and redo the water/sewer system.  Either a reduced radius of effect, or more gradual decline in capability would be greatly appreciated.  And I'm sure that's not the only mechanic issue that needs some massage.\n\nAnyhow, very charming, VERY Early Access (this should be highlighted more on the store page honestly -- I wasn't aware it was early access until I started hitting some issues.)  Hopefully all this resolved though and get a nice working city builder!  And the art and sound is extremely nice.","June 28, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

This game doesn’t aim to innovate on the genre- no- it does the opposite. It takes the old impressions formula and adapts it to a brand new theme... Now you may be thinking to yourself “that sounds terrible, why is this a positive review?” and if that is what you are thinking right now then likely you just don’t understand what exactly made these games magical. Fans of this series have been dreaming of the day when we would finally find another 2D title/developer capable of taking the torch and running with it... while Lethis is not perfect (I will come to my current issues with it soon) it certainly does do exactly what it says on the tin.\nLethis is comprised of a comprehensive (albeit buggy) campaign, a number of sandbox maps and a decently sized series of economic chains all with a focus on steampunk aesthetic. It has wonderful soundtrack and art to support the setting in a colourful way. You will see your small plebs squishing fae, cutting giant fish, washing massive silk worms and more. While the game does not have voice acted plebs like the impressions titles did, it does boast an impressive array of walker sprites which add variety to the game immensely. The only thing which is really cutting away at the immersion is the huge number of spelling and translation mistakes- but this can be easily forgiven when you realise that the developer is not a native speaker and they will likely be fixed over time.\nThe largest problems with Lethis in its current state are mostly found in the early game- but could likely be tweaked away. Food production seems too low for the amount consumed but industry production seems far far too HIGH. Covering a district in walkers often requires far too many buildings because the decay rate between building stages upon losing access to things seems far too fast. Someone doesn’t walk past for a few? Well- suddenly your entire district will go down three levels in a blink of an eye. The large maps are great and all, but with how quick houses can devolve that is counter-productive. One massive swarm of people leaving can often meet another swam of people coming to replace them... That seems screwy to me.\nAll and all though, the good far outweighs the bad and the game more than manages to scratch the itch left post Impressions. If you love these kinds of games chances are you will love this one too. If you didn’t love them though I doubt there would be much (if anything) here that would interest you.","June 27, 2015","true","18.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Will recommend any future buyers to check out the game's support page and find out if you own any of the Nvdia cards which will cause an OpenGL crash when you try to open the in-game warehouse page.\n\nThis is dissappointing as the game looks pretty good to get into and the short while I managed to play the game before my crashes did show the game's potential. Unfortunately the developers are saying that the crashes are due to the drivers provided by Nvdia and nothing they can do to fix it. Quite a few of the people, including myself, who have experienced the crash have upgraded or rollback to previous drivers but nothing works. Sucks that this is the only game that is causing an issue for me when none of the other games I am playing has this issue at all. Worse is buying a game and having it in my library for > 14 days and Steam says they cannot refund it due to their policy. :(","February 7","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, it feels unpolished and needs more convinent ways to play the game.\n\nI never played builders from impression style (or that is what is called) I found some mechanics a bit frustration such as having to delete demolished games instead of able to just build building on top of it or even seperate demolish buttons for roads, buildings and collapsed buildings. It may be traditional mechanics, but it would be nice to see some of things to be changed for convinenents.\n\nAlso, when you press ESC, usual UI drops ablign you to change options and go to main menu or quit. However, you can't use ESC again to get back into the game. you have to press resume, which is not too bad but still a bit frustrationg\n\ni only played 3 tutorials, but encountered 4 random crashes which have no common elements other then simply crashed during game plays. There were auto saves but the crashes made the game not enjoyable along with low fps even tho my laptop is much more powerful then recommended. Even devs said my rig is very powerful and they do not know why my fps is 20~25 range. It may be the fps that is causing my mouse movement to be choppy and not smooth.\n\nAlso it would be nice if they able us to use hotkeys more then simple pause, move maps and such. I hope they add them in the future.\n\nI have played about an hour but the crashes, choppy mouse movement and lack of hotkeys made the game less enjoyable for now. I will pick it up later on during sales or patches and see how much they improve.\n\nLastly, I really like the devs. they are passionate and they are willing to accept their mistakes. I wish they can improve the game much more and create great games in the future.\n\n","June 30, 2015","false","17.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

It should explain to you what each building is used for and overall it's an OK tutorial but needs work done.  There should also be more different types of buildings available like residential, commercial. I know that this time period probably didn't have a lot of of those buildings but there needs to be a more variety of buildings to use. For example there should be like a forester hut who can plant trees.\nThere should be an editor to allow users to create their own maps to play on in the game and the map should come in different sizes maybe like 4 sizes like small, medium, large or huge. This game should also be made available to use the workshop. When comparing this to games like banished I think It lacks modding usage and also banished I think is a more better detailed then Lethis is only by a small margin.\nFor the people who are still having crashes or issues with their graphics card. Try turning off the anti-aliasing option in the nvidia control panal. only do this If your getting like a white screen or black screen.

Whatever, I expect that'll be mostly fixed. That's not my biggest problem here. My biggest problem is the writing.\n\nOkay, the devs are French. That doesn't mean they can't find a native English speaker to read and edit their English writing. It's incredibly stilted and often doesn't make a lick of sense. There's a lot of simple errors (like mixing up a county and a countship, or plural and possessive). That would be a bit forgivable, but the content of their writing isn't better. Apparently steam is a form of energy, and is harvested cleanly from geisers? What? And there's a European character who looks ethnically black, because if we palette-swap a white person that's totally celebrating diversity, right?\n\nIf you have a very strong ability to ignore everything stupid about the game, I suspect the gameplay will probably be fun enough once they sort out the bugs and balance issues.

There is no explanation and no way round from what I can see. I restart map to see if maybe I missed something and it crashes.\n\nReload and repeat. Exactly the same no one will work in granary or shop. No way of progressing. Look online, nothing, game doesnt seem to have a forum anywhere.\n\nThink, maybe it is just a bug with tutorial and try the campaign. Load up first mission, this time game starts with no map. I dont mean the mini map, I literally mean no world to build on, just a blue screen.\n\nMaybe it is just me as the very positive reviews likened this to the old Sierra city building genre, however it is completely unplayable for me.\n\nWill look into it more and change my review if it gets sorted out, however those of you looking at reviews like I did and thinking this is my type of game, please be aware that it is completely broken from my perspective at least. I honestly have very low hopes in all honesty and would say this looks a lot simpler and less engaging then games like caesar and emperor.\n\nI really hope I am wrong or they fix it soon as this is my type of game, however for now I will be requesting my money back that is how dissapointed I am with this release. Developers should learn from ARK: SE example rather then keep churning out rubbish and expecting us to pay good money for it.\n\nEDIT - So tried one more time and this time I got campaign to load, then I had the complete opposite problem, my shop and my granary was fully working, however my farms had no staff.
