The first group of people looked at the glowing reviews that this game received, tried it, then found it stupendously overhyped and underwhelming. Then, there’s the other group, who found the game to be perfect. I am glad to say that I belong to the latter party.The late great film critic Roger Ebert once said that videogames can never be art, a controversial statement at best and blatantly offensive and wrong at worst. With that said, we’re going to have to forgive Mr. Ebert, because a)He was great at what he did, and b) He never got the chance to experience Brothers: A Tale of two Sons.\n\nStory:You play as two brothers who are sent off on a journey to find a cure for their father’s ailment. You, as the player, are tasked to guide the two brothers through multiple trials and tribulations throughout a variety of beautiful and mystifying locations. Along the way, you will encounter numerous characters, many of which are heavily inspired from classic fairytales and fantasy mythology. There is so much more to talk about here, but once again, this is something you really need to experience yourself. You really will get more out of this game if you go in mostly blind.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the game is completely dialogue-free. No, I don’t mean that the game merely lacks voice acting. I mean that there is essentially no actual dialogue – voice or text, in the game at all. Sort of. The characters technically do talk, but in a fantasy language without translation. Instead, the story and interactions are told through beautifully-animated gestures and changes in tone and inflections. Despite this, there is never any ambiguity about what’s happening on-screen, and somehow, the game manages to weave a heartfelt story that, at times, can truly invoke a heavy feeling in the chest.\n\nGameplay:Brothers is a story-driven adventure/puzzle game with a novel control scheme. Each brother is mapped to a single stick on the controller. The left and right stick/shoulder buttons control the older and younger brother, respectively. It’s a unique control scheme for sure, in the sense that this game looks like a co-op game for two players, but is actually a single player game, intended to be played on the same controller. The challenge in the game is largely dependent on the player’s ability to co-ordinate both characters at once. The ambidextrous be warned – this game will probably offer you very little challenge.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out at this point that contrary to what the text in the orange box says on the store page on Steam, a controller is not required to play the game. The game will work fine using a keyboard, and you’ll be more than able to progress to the end of the game without a controller. With that said, a controller is strongly recommended for this game.\n\nFor the combat-oriented players – sorry, but this game is completely combat-free. Instead, the game largely involves puzzles comprised of environmental interactions and exploration. Each brother has their own perks. The older, taller and stronger brother is able to reach heights, boost the younger brother, push levers and swim, whilst the younger brother can fit into smaller spaces. Unfortunately, delving into more of the interactions between the two brothers would spoil the game for you.\n\nThe game is never overly challenging or frustrating. OOT Water Temple this is not. Puzzles are, for the most part, fairly straightforward, but are often challenging enough to invoke a sense of satisfaction when you do overcome them.  Death can and likely will occur, but checkpoints are frequent, sparing you from repeating the same segments repeatedly.\nOne of my only gripes, gameplay-wise, was the repetition of some of the puzzles. Using the big brother to boost the little brother up to a ledge got very old very quickly. With that said, even the puzzles that are solved the same way are often presented in a different setting, with a different outcome, which helps to keep them fresh.\n\nMy only other "criticism" is that this game is short and lacks any compelling reason to go back to it after you’re finished. This is, unfortunately, a consequence of any game that is primarily narrative-driven.  The game does support achievements, but these involve optional, easily-missed activities in the game, and are neither challenging or particularly satisfying to obtain.\n\nPresentation:This game is beautiful. Not the realistic kind of beautiful that we’d expect from AAA games such as … The Watch Dogs E3 trailer, but appropriately beautiful. You would not want to play this game and have it look like anything other than what it looks like. The world that Brothers takes place in is strikingly magnificent. The town you begin your journey in is vibrant and colourful, whilst later settings are often appropriately darker and harsher. The shadowing and lighting in this game also look tremendous.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the graphics however, is the incredible work that was done to illustrate the enormous scale of the game. No matter where you are, there is always a lot going on in the background, making you feel incredibly small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things – something that will be very familiar to those that have played the God of War series, or the critically acclaimed Shadow of the Colossus. Moving to new locations was often breathtaking, although each individual is area is so gorgeous on its own that it's hard to move on.\n\nThis, of course, was no accident. The game was clearly deliberately designed to immerse you in the environment, and allows you to interact with almost everything, despite the fact that this is completely optional and you are not awarded with anything other than the short animation that accompanies your action. In other words, the game doesn’t force you, or even encourage you (from a gameplay perspective) to sit on a bench in town and really take in the gorgeous scenery, but you, the player, will want to anyway.\n\nThe music and sounds also complement the game perfectly, and contribute immensely to the emotional impact of the game. I’ve honestly listened to the music numerous times since finishing the game, and all the emotions I experienced from the game just come rushing back. I honestly can’t fault a single thing about the audio in this game, as I feel that it perfectly complements both the emotions and the atmosphere that are conveyed.\n\nOverall thoughts:In case it wasn’t obvious, I loved Brothers. There is very little about the game that I can fault. With that said, I’ll admit it’s not for everybody. The game is very narrative-driven and requires a heavy emotional investment – something that not every gamer is prepared to, capable, or willing to do. It’s worth noting that this game could very well have been another To The Moon, or Gone Home – games which I personally loved, and are very story/emotionally-driven, but lack any real gameplay, closely flirting with the definition of what a “Game” truly is. No one played either of those two games and said “Wow, that was fun”, because plain and simple, the gameplay in those two games are complete garbage. Brothers, however, manages to capture the same kind of narrative and emotion (and arguably exceeds them both) without compromising on the gameplay. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that this is, in fact, a game. That is the true magic of Brothers.","November 12, 2014","true","6.2"," 509 of 586 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","509","586","7","12"

Brothers is a game that deals with many different themes, some fantastical in nature, but tackles them head on and with a touch of nuance. It's also a very charming game that overcomes any technical limitation through great art direction.\n\nIts basic concept of controlling the older brother on the left analog stick and the younger brother on the right is one that may turn off some at first but truly comes into its own as the game progresses with a thematic payoff unlike anything I've ever seen in a game before. Brothers also has excellent pacing that carries over into its puzzles. They are simple yet I never felt like they were braindead easy. They're always fresh in some way and play off of mechanics I learned before without ever showing a tutorial on screen outside of the beginning chapter.\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons was an excellently developed puzzle platformer that wasn't afraid to go to some dark places but also knew when to highlight a truly joyous moment. And this was all through gameplay. These special moments or sections were rarely shown through cutscenes only. It wants you to experience these parts through gameplay as much as possible, and it very much succeeds at that. But it's a climactic moment near the end that truly brings that idea home. A moment so brilliant and emotionally resonant to me that it'd be a shame if people missed out on this because we're on the cusp of a new console generation transition. Don't pass this game up. It begs to be played.","September 6, 2013","true","2.7"," 382 of 433 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","382","433","0","0"

This game is a quintessential example of the avant-garde in gaming.  Perfectly crafted single-player co-op is now a reality as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons will have you controlling two characters simultaneously (by using the dual joysticks of modern controllers) as you embark on a short, but heartfelt, adventure.\n\nThe game plays as an adventure-puzzler game.  You will have to control both of your characters simultaneously and use their different strengths and abilities in tandem to solve the various puzzles you encounter on your adventure.  It really is quite an experience and there were several times where I could actually feel my brain get crossed-up as I tried to control both characters at once.  This is definitely the kind of game that exercises your brain.  I would say this mechanic alone would make the game worth playing, even if the other aspects were poor.  Fortunately, pretty much all the other aspects of the game are first-rate as well.\n\nSupplementing the innovative mechanics at the core of the game are the elegant graphics, pleasing soundscape, and overall charming atmosphere.  There are some really varied and well-crafted areas to traverse as you play through the story.  More than just looking different, the various areas of the game feel different—  and each add their own twist to the gameplay.\n\nThe game is ultimately a story-driven experience.  That story is simple, but told well— evoking empathy.  The levels, while gorgeous, are quite linear; and the puzzles, while innovative, are quite simple.  And those factors only serve to contribute to the brevity of the game.  Most people should be able to complete the game in 3 to 4 hours; it is the kind of thing that can (and probably should) be done in one immersive sitting.  It is the definition of “short-and-sweet.”\n\nBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons is one of those games I would say basically everyone will enjoy. Even if you don’t really play games that much, or are someone who only plays a specific genre very different from this, I still must implore you to play this game.  It is very well-crafted, delightfully innovative, and short enough that it is worth anyone’s time to experience.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 182 of 202 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","182","202","8","7"

The acknowledgement that one day we will all pass from this mortal world is just one of the many transitions from childhood to adulthood we must unfortunately accept. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is the first game I have played to use such a weighty thematic element such as death during this time of transition from child to adult and to use it so beautifully.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=257540870\nSo its no surprise then that Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons journey begins with a death, arguably one of the most tragic lessons life can bestow upon a young child when a young and naive Nayee, one of the two brothers of the title, witnesses the death of his mother and is unable to help or save her from her fate. Because of this - Nayee's father sees the child as weak and bestows most of his tokenism and love on his eldest and favorite son - Nayaa. When the boys father becomes gravely ill and finds himself on death's doorstep both boys are encouraged by the Elder-tribesman and sage of the village to undertake a journey to The Tree of Life which is said to contain a powerful sap that restores life.\n\nWhere Nayee is fearful, weak and young, Nayaa is brave, strong and on the cusp of becoming a man. Their journey will test their brotherly love for one another as they race to save a father from deaths icy grasp. It's also through this journey that Nayee will begin his own transition into adulthood, eventually determining and defining his own inner wells of courage and strength that will enable him to make peace with the loss of his mother even when the price of this lesson comes at the cost of another life. Since the central theme of the game deals with ones mortality and how this affects us and those around us, almost every single turn during Nayee and Nayaa's journey the two brothers will be confronted with death in all its shapes and forms and while the symbolism may be a tad bit heavy-handed it conveys the central message beautifully.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=257520965\nInstead of placing the gamer solely in Nayee' shoes, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons lets the player control both brothers. This is done through each analogue stick on the controller with the left and right trigger buttons becoming each brothers action key. At first it can be a bit tricky navigating some of the games environments but it's not long before one snaps into a routine simply just pointing each analogue stick in the direction one wants each brother to go. Having the player fill the shoes of both brothers (although this is arguably Nayee's tale) , Nayaa no longer exists simply as character in the game but as an actual extension of the player. Along the way there will be some environmental puzzles to navigate but nothing too taxing that the solution doesn't immediately jump out at you when you examine it.\n\nIf Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons has a weakness then it would have to be this puzzle element which rarely requires any thought from its player. I can understand, however, why they probably did this since the journey the brothers face is one where the luxury of time is not a given. The fact that one can race through all the areas quite quickly does add a sense of urgency to the tale but many will probably bemoan the asking price ($14.99 and the roughly three hours play you get out of it) and miss the meaning behind it all completely. The game makes use of the Unreal 3 engine and as would be expected from an engine that gave life to some of the most amazing and beautiful games from last gen, it looks quite incredible. It's also matched with a very low-fi soundtrack that suits the melancholy perfectly.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=257520890\nBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons is also like a love letter to ICO, that PS2 critical darling and gem of a game that went on to become a Playstation cult favorite and which is still regarded by many (myself included) to be one of the finest games ever created. Like Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, ICO was also short in length and featured two protagonists in similar constricting circumstances that drew the gamer into its world causing them to feel a range of emotions for a set of pixels. It did feature combat (although to be honest the combat always felt out of place, like it had been tacked on because the publisher was most likely a little unsure how such an artistic, existential game could ever co-exist in a market dominated by first person shooters). The fact it went to on to become a smash-hit I can only thank the gods of small mercies for because without ICO there would be no Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons, no Gone Home, no The Walking Dead Season 1.\n\nI really loved Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons and the message it conveys is a powerful and deeply felt one. While it may not reach the heights that ICO achieved it should leave every single gamer who experiences its tale deeply emotionally satisfied and possibly moved. This is the sort of game you should honestly spend full price on and not wait for a sale because these game experiences only come along every once in a while and should be applauded and what better way to applaud an experience this special then by giving it its proper value so we can hopefully see more.

It showed us, that how immensely powerful a video game can be, when its game-play and story complements each other so perfectly.\n\nThe world is detailed, charming and vibrant, and despite its story being only 3-4 hours long, it takes you through a multitude of environments, every chapter feels fresh, compelling and interesting, and filled with mini side-quests that reward you with achievements and extra contents.\n\nThe controls for “Brothers” is pretty unique, you simultaneously control two individual characters to solve interesting, varied puzzles in order to progress through the level, on a quest to search for the water of life to save their father. The puzzles themselves are well thought out and doesn’t outstay its welcome, and despite having strange control scheme, I can safely say it works extremely well a Controller and I personally had no problems with it whatsoever.\n\nThe story is what makes Brothers so brilliant, it immerses you into the world almost immediately, during my short but wonderful play-though I've experienced happiness, fear, wanderlust, compassion and profound sadness. I really think that no other means of media can really replicate such a mesmerising experience, it successfully told me a coherent, fulfilling and mature story without the characters saying single word, but solely relies on pure interactive game-play.\n\n“Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons” is incredible, and a game that you don’t want to miss, I had a truly unforgettable experience and I think you will too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jshackles/recommended/225080/","jshackles","jshackles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jshackles/","3382 products in account","This game is really good.\n\nThe controls - while it can be difficult to get used to, after a while it just starts to feel like second nature.  Each thumbstick (left and right) on the controller controls one of the two brothers, and each matching trigger is that brother's "action" button.   While this game would be incredibly easy if it were played with two people (each with one controller), it becomes an interesting and rewarding mental exercise trying to control both characters yourself.\n\nThe story - also very good.  The characters don't speak (really) but talk in a kind of "Sim-ish" language.  The developers put a lot of effort into portraying the characters through their body language and tone rather than speech directly.  The game takes place in a world that could best be described as a "grimm-style" fairy tale.\n\nDifficulty - although you can die, the game is super generous with it's checkpoints, so it would be difficult to get frustrated with the game.  The main focus here is on solving puzzles and some light platforming.\n\nAchievements - another interesting idea well executed here.  None of the game's 12 achievements will be unlocked during normal game play.

This isn't me being negative or insulting, it's just fact, the controls of the Brothers is pure gimmick. But, it works quite well! (<exclamation point, doesn't show on Steam reviews :|)\n\nOther than the controls, I didn't really feel the game set itself out as as much of a stupendous game as I'd been led to believe; certainly not Game of the Year, which I heard some had elected it to be.\n\nI fully completed the game within 5 hours and did indeed enjoy the story. The graphics, at times, were mindblowing, and are definitely this title's strongest point. It's weakest feature, however, I feel, is the lack of language from the characters. There's a certain charm listening to the almost Simlish talk from the characters, but ultimately it dissociates you from the characters, being unable to fully understand them, and unable to fully connect with them.\n\nWhen you do connect, it's on a base level of emotion, and has almost no base in logic or drive, just raw emotion. Which, at times is more than enough to push the game forward, but at others leave you with a feeling of pointless energy, "I guess we just go forward then?" for no real reason.\n\nThe game is really fun and definitely something everyone should experience, but it is by no means one of the greatest games I've played. I had a super time with it, and found it very cost-worthy at it's price, and would recommend it to all.\n\nNilesy","December 8, 2013","true","5.3"," 183 of 257 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","183","257","0","5"

Despite the game states that it requires a controller to play, it actually works fine with keyboard.\nThe game is just wonderful, and keeps you at the edge of the seat - there's only a few sections where timing counts, most of the time you can keep your own pace, but as you'll pass hills, caverns, mountains there's always something to concentrate on. Most of the time it's the brand new ideas the game presents - the store's screenshots are from the game's first  (maybe) 2 chapters, most of the game's content is pretty different and presents you with new experiences. You always have to pay attention to the movement if you're playing alone, but it's not overbearing, and it doesn't require pinpoint accuracy. The biggest challenge of the game is to not to mix up your two hands and which one controls witch brother :)  While all you have is direction keys and an action button, this game is nowhere near an average walking simulator. The landscape goes though incredible changes as you progress, and you have various means of transportation that are both unique and makes excellent use of the game's control scheme.\nThis game is a beautiful, albeit short journey which in turn has absolutely minimal downtime. It's a great purchase or it makes an excellent gift for anyone who's willing to try out the game's controls and loves traditional tales, as the game takes place in a similar world.  The game contains darker tones, it's not really a kid-friendly game - the Teen rating is fitting in my opinion.","February 15","true","11.4"," 40 of 40 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","40","40","2","2"

Both Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness gave their players dark and gritty worlds to explore and some unique gameplay twists to hook players. With such a pedigree Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons stands out as being wholly against type. It's the video game equivalent of Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, stepping away from subject matter reserved for mature audiences to deliver a memorable experience that can be enjoyed by audiences both young and old. While seemingly stepping out of the comfort zone established by their track record, Brothers stands out as one of 2013's best, and most surprising, releases.\n\nWhile the setting and tone of Brothers is a departure from Starbreeze's previous titles, they have maintained their fine tradition of offering refreshing gameplay mechanics. Each brother's ability to move is mapped to a joystick and each trigger acts as an interaction button for the corresponding brother. While some games have you changing between multiple characters to solve puzzles, Brothers allows you to control both characters simultaneously reducing the tedium of having to switch between characters or deliver commands to AI companions. Initially, this control setup may seem a bit clumsy but after taking a few moments to acclimate yourself to the setup it becomes natural. The brothers will face numerous challenges and all of them can be overcome with a bit of teamwork. Having the older, stronger brother boost his young sibling up to high ledges so that he can drop a rope is a small example in a long list of ways in which the boys can join forces to overcome the obstacles in their way. Starbreeze deserves high praise for finding so many unique ways to test players and make the most of the brother's teamwork. This is a major reason that A Tale of Two Sons succeeds. Throughout the three hour game, players will shift the brother's weight to steer a glider, use a rope that tethers the boys together to swing to far away ledges, distract a pesky dog with one brother so that the other brother can pass through an area safely and so on. In spite of how many different challenges players will face, it's not difficult to figure out what to do next. Unfortunately, this reprieve from frustration is complicated by a nasty side effect: Brothers is way too easy. Most players will feel completely untested by the puzzles and proceed almost entirely unopposed.\n\nWhile it's ease means most players may not recall any of the specific challenges that make up Brother's campaign after completing it, they will almost undoubtedly remember the game's tone and narrative. The plot is simple, the boy's father falls ill and after taking him to the town doctor they are told to go in search of a cure. This is a terrible blow to the brothers since they have already lost their mother after she drowned; the younger brother in particular is scarred by her loss as he witnessed her struggle before she succumbed to the depths. Their willingness to undertake such a perilous journey is indicative how important it is to them not to loose anyone else with grief and loss becoming a central theme. While the plot is simple, it benefits from the fact that it's telling forgoes the use of dialogue. The characters speak in a made up unsubtitled language allowing players to hone in on the their inflections and gestures. This emphasis on feeling rather than exposition allows the events to soak in without being burdened by anything superfluous or disruptive to the experience. Further enriching the experience is the fact that dozens of objects and people can be interacted with that are wholly non-essential to progressing in the game and each brother interacts with these people or objects differently. The younger brother comes off as quite ornery and mischievous while his big brother is a well behaved and serious. Discovering these traits instead of having them force fed to players is far more rewarding.\n\nRounding out Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons as more of an experience than simply a game is it's stunning art direction and score. The fantasy world in A Tale of Two Sons is rendered in bright colors and it's texture work has an almost hand-painted quality. The home of the title characters is on the coast, near a sleepy village. This humble setting gradually gives way to more wondrous settings with picturesque mountain ranges, crystal clear bodies of water and vertigo inducing cliff sides. The studio relishes the game's aesthetics by placing benches around the world that the boys can sit on, allowing the camera to zoom in and create a post card worthy view of the game world. The colorful Disney-esque landscapes do eventually give way to some areas that have darker motifs adding a bit of gravity to the boys' trek as well as giving the world a story of it's own. While the environments are fantastic but the boys can appear a bit bland with their cartoon character skin textures and average NPC villager outerwear.\n\nThe soundtrack is haunting and nuanced, giving the proceedings a bit of dramatic flair without being too intrusive or overbearing. The somber flutes, strings and chanting that make up the bulk of what tickles player's ear drums has a unique sonic signature that adds a layer of personality to a game that, due to it's fantasy setting, has some derivative subject matter.\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons may very well be this generation's Ico. It's seems that the Playstation 2's companion based cult classic was an inspiration for Starbreeze's game. Emphasizing emotion over raw exposition and dialogue, A Tale of Two Sons carves a space in players memories to reside long term. The plethora of puzzles prevents players from feeling burdened by tedious and stale routines and some darker moments later in the game remind players of the seriousness of their quest lest they get lost in the game's stunning, fantasy world. Were it more challenging, Brothers could have provided an almost flawless experience. While the gameplay may not give you a sense of accomplishment, the narrative payoff is significant enough to make A Tale of Two Sons a mandatory buy for any serious gamer.","May 21, 2014","true","3.9"," 114 of 156 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","114","156","0","4"

Everyone in the game speaks some weird language, but as you get to know both of the brothers you will have a great time playing and interacting with everything and everyone in your way.\n\nThe gameplay is very different of any other game, but is pretty nice once you get used to it. The control itself is pretty simple, one button to do any action that is needed, but happily there is a lot of situations to explore this system and all of them is brilliant. You control both of the brothers at the same time and in some parts you will face challenges to do two different things using both of them to progress in the story.\n\nThe visual and the art direction is awesome beautiful. I can't describe how mesmerising is to see (and play) many parts of the game.\n\nThe music is also incredible, it brings you into the heart of the game. Sometimes you will feel like the brothers are feeling, sometimes it will push you up like if you were invincible. It will bring joy making you smile, but it will also brings you down. It connects you in the universe in a very strong way.\n\nUnfortunately there is some negative points: the story is pretty short, about 3 hours of gameplay and that's it. Even the achievements are pretty easy to get after you complete the game and won't make you play more. The game does support keyboard (using the arrows, W,A,S,D, right control and spacebar), although I imagine the experience will not be that nice because the controls are unusual. I didn't test play using the keyboard, but that must be the reason Steam has an alert that says it requires a controller to play.\n\nAfter all that, I'm glad to say that Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a very unique game and will give you an awesome experience. You must play it, or better yet, you must experience it. Now.\n\n[Update on 07/01/2014]\n- Thanks to DrSpoonbender for commenting and let me know about the keyboard support :)","June 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","52","60","0","2"

With their father's demise on the horizon they set out on a quest to find the "water of life", a mysterious liquid with healing qualities.  With no choices left they embark on a journey they won't soon forget.\n\nGameplayBrothers is an adventure game with some modest puzzle solving.  The puzzles are fairly simplistic in nature so adventuring is the primary focus.  You will, of course, need teamwork by using the two brothers in tandem and sometimes apart.  The environment is often times treacherous and will require using both brothers in various ways to progress.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics in Brothers are absolutely gorgeous.  They are colorful, vibrant, and imaginative and they bring the fairy tale scenery to realization.  You will ascent rolling hilltops and mountains and explore the depths of dank caves.  You will explore a creepy, sinister forest that will lead into a calm, tranquil valley; there is good variety and contrast in all of the distinct areas.\n\nControls (a controller is recommended for this game)\nIn Brothers you control two characters simultaneously.  At first I was distressed at the thought but the game quickly put my thoughts at ease.  Each brother is easy to control and I never had any issues whatsoever.  Controlling the two brothers at the same time was effortless; it was easy to manage them and make them do precisely what I wanted.\n\nSoundThe music in Brothers is clever and accents the scene.  In dire situations where dangers are about the music is quite moody.  When it's more slow-paced the music is serene.  The sound effects are well done and help pull you into the wonderful atmosphere.\n\nOverallBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a must play for any gamer with a controller.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/225080/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons tells the story of two boys who have already struggled with the loss of their mother, and are now faced with the reality of a sick and dying father. The village doctor expresses to them that they must travel to a special tree where they can retrieve what is needed to cure him. The journey takes the brothers through bright, beautiful landscapes meeting both friend and foe along the way.\n\nAny words spoken in this title are not words at all. It’s gibberish not unlike what you would hear from The Sims, though decidedly less silly. It threw me at first, even prompting me to stop and ensure that I had the correct language chosen in the settings – only to find that there was no language setting at all. Still, you are never left wondering what a character intended to say. Through actions and situations, the message is always clear. It’s as if the developer dispensed with dialogue in much the same way a child removes training wheels from his bicycle.\n\nThe true genius of this game is in the way that it uses game mechanics to connect the two brothers to each other, and the player to them. Both brothers are controlled simultaneously, one with the left stick and left trigger, the other with the right stick and right trigger – as the player, you are the common link. It feels a bit clumsy and takes some getting used to, and though it becomes easier with time, I never quite felt like I ever got the hang of it even as the game concluded. Fortunately, nothing about this title is particularly demanding from a platforming perspective.\n\nBrothers feels exactly like the type of game you’d make if you paid attention to how mechanics feed into narrative, and grew up surrounded by Swedish folk lore and the writings of Astrid Lindgren – author of books like Pippi Longstocking and Emil of Lönneberga, and the more pertinent to this game; The Brothers Lionhart and Ronia The Robber’s Daughter. That’s not to say that Brothers feels derivative – far from it. It’s just evocative of those things, which actually makes it stand out, more than anything. Have it all be coordinated by the steady storytelling hand of Josef Fares, and it’s no mystery why this tale of two sons actually turned out pretty fantastic.\n\nSince you always have two characters on the screen at once, it’s basically a one player co-op game – and though that may initially seem like a point of critique, it almost immediately becomes apparent that it’s pretty much the entire point of the game. As you become more and more comfortable with the controls, you eventually get a feel for how these characters are in sync – a true sense of relation that isn’t just fed to you through a cutscene. In fact, the way the game conveys how these brothers help each other out is one of the simplest yet most powerful things I’ve seen someone do with the medium.\n\nThe bulk of the game feels a little bit like ICO. You do some platforming, some puzzling, some light navigating through perilous situations. It’s never difficult, and certainly not mechanically stressful – but the crux isn’t so much in nail biting challenge, but rather in the interplay between the two characters. The element of doing things in tandem keeps you involved and engaged in a way that doesn’t require the obstacles themselves to be overly convoluted. You’ll guide one character to turn a wheel, while guiding the other to ride an elevator. You’ll move a vine sideways while the other character is climbing up and down to avoid danger. You’ll control the paddles in a boat separately, or operate a see-saw to cut a tree down. There are more elaborate examples, but that would be telling!\n\nAdding to the impact of Brothers is the way it marries its visual and audio presentation to its story. The storybook landscapes and pastel quality to the textures evoke the game’s Nordic heritage, and Gustaf Grefberg’s score effortlessly underpins the emotional beats of the story without overpowering it. Caught somewhere between ThatGameCompany’s gameplay-light, aesthetically led works, and some of the more gameplay focused indie titles of recent years, such as Braid or Bastion. Brothers falters slightly by trying to please both masters. However it also manages to step out of the shadows of its influences by utilising its unique control scheme to enhance its story. It’s a wonderful example of tying mechanics to theme and its easy to imagine elements of what Brothers does being copied and iterated on in the future.\n\nIt feels like another example of smaller games stepping out into unique and interesting directions and telling smaller, more personal stories in ways only possible through the medium. It’s easy to overlook a lot of what makes Brothers unique from first glance, its unassuming style belies a title with a lot more on its mind. But stick with it and you’ll be rewarded with something really quite special.\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons is not about challenging platforming or confounding puzzles. It’s not about replay value or flashy visuals. This game’s brilliance is in how its moving story is told: all because of how you move your fingers – which buttons you’re pressing, and which ones you’re not. This is a breakthrough in what interactivity can accomplish with little aid from more traditional storytelling mechanics – its resulting importance to this medium is no exaggeration.","March 4","true","26.9"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","29","30","2","0"

Highly recommended for everyone who likes storyrich, movie-like adventure games.\n\nYou play as two brothers who are on a journey to find a special "magic water" to cure their father from a deadly disease. And I mean you play/control both brothers at the same time, the older brother with WASD+Space(interact) and the little brother with the arrow keys+rightCTRL(interact). In the beginning this coordination seems to be a huge challenge but you get used to it quite soon and once you can handle this special controls its really fun.\nEvery brother has his own strenghts and weaknesses (and personality which you notice when you let the brothers interact with certain persons or things) so they have to help each other = you have to coordinate both brothers in their own way to beat the challenges along your way (these "puzzles" are simple to be honest but in my opinion that doesnt matter since the focus in this game is definately on the story and they are still fun to solve).\nThis kind of mechanics offer a unique and very special gameplay experience.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, especially the water and light effects. Youll fnd a lot of benches along the way, use these opportunities to sit down for a moment and enjoy the view!\n\nUnfortunately the game is relatively short - you need 3-4 hours from start to finish, but nevertheless the story is deep and the characters (the two brothers, there arent any more important characters) are complex, for me personally it felt much longer than the three hours it took me to play it through for the first time.\n\nI encountered one single bug: I got stuck once between a ledge and the hand of a troll but since theres a checkpoint every few minutes that wasnt a serious problem and like I said it happened only once.\n\nOther things to mention: You cant save your game, but there are enough checkpoints. There arent any video or audio settings to configurate except gamma correction and music/effect volume and you cant change the controls - but none of this is necessary or would be useful for the game. The language in the whole game is a fictional language but due to the brothers body language (and the given context in general) you can always understand what they mean.\n\nThat was it... nice game. 7/10.\n\nEDIT: Oh I forgot... You wont get a single achievement just during the usual game, for doing what you have to do to get ahead.

I played it when it came out on the 360 and had to buy it again on Steam.\n\nThe first thing to know about this game is that it's ideally suited to a gampad with two analog sticks. It's possible to play with a mouse and keyboard, but it was specifically designed with a dual analog stick controller in mind.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics can take a little getting used to, but after a short time, they feel very fluid and natural. You control one brother with the left stick and left trigger and the other brother with the right stick and right trigger. Those are the only buttons you use. Sounds simple and it is, but it's so unique. I've never played a game like this as far as controlling characters and it's truly a joy to play.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly simple, but satisfying. The music is absolutely beautiful. The graphics aren't going to push your graphics card, but they are definitely appealing.\n\nThe story is at times funny, hopeful, touching, and incredibly sad. There is no spoken language in the game, but it does an amazing job conveying emotions via the characters gestures and vocalizations.\n\nThis is definitely one the most interesting games I've played in a very long time and I highly recommend that you give it a try.","December 20, 2013","true","3.1"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","33","40","0","2"

Making a game that push the emotional side may not be an easy task since everyone have their own personality, so while many can relate and feel empathy, to others the theme may just not click with them, at all. However, it’s best to play this game with an open mind, let yourself immerse in this small Story and see how important it is to work together for a good cause. While no game should ever be judged by its length, Brothers will not take you more than 3 to 5 hours to complete, yet, this is just the right amount of time to experience the adventure, to discover the world and to struggle in a place full of dangers -during day or night-, for a good cause, your father.\n\nThe way you control both brothers is not something many are used to and to some it was either annoying or hard to get around to some but I think it was a very creative idea. You see, a family is a very strong bond and should be something that you should cherish. It’s common to have a little fight with your little/older brother or sister in real life and that does not mean you don’t love him/her, it just mean that sometimes you need to adapt to a different way of thinking, a different taste in something, etc. The very same happens with the control scheme in this game, you need to train your brain to master both characters with each analog stick from your controller. It may not be easy at first but once you get used to, it gets a lot easier. And while you’re still adapting to this and you end up getting each brother to a different direction, well, that may also happen in real life. Just remember to cherish the moments with him because you never know what may happen.\n\nThere are some puzzles in the game but neither proved to be a hard challenge. The game focus more on storytelling than gameplay mechanics and while you adventure further and further, take a moment to sit down, stop for a bit and just enjoy the scenery, which by the way, is breathtaking; just don’t take too long, someone is waiting for you at home! Having an emotional focused game is always a risk but I believe Brothers managed to do it quite well in this short adventure with a strong ending and perhaps one or two surprises, just pay attention from the very start to make sure you don’t miss any interesting bits from the story right from the start.\n","September 20, 2014","true","3.9"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","1"

The player controls both characters, where the player goes on an epic journey across all kinds different landscapes just to find a certain important object, which can save a certain someone. I don't want to give too much away b/c this game is absolutely epic, personal, and moving.\n\nBrothers: ATOTS is basically a cross b/t a platformer, puzzle-game, and adventure game (like say a very-linear Tomb Raider game made before TR 2013) - but, there is absolutely no combat here what-so-ever. Brothers feels like it is something straight out of a classic fairy-tale or fable, drenched with tons of personality in its art direction & art design. It's nothing short of wonderful, with its excellent story-book look and feel. This couldn't have been done any better.\n\nMost things here are not said to the player via dialogue or any sort of narration, they are shown to the player. There is no English dialogue - everything here is spoken in a language that sounds like its right out of The Sims' own Sim-language of gibberish. You come to conclusions, based on what you see on screen and how things are laid out and presented to you. Everything is meticulously placed, from the environments to characters - and a lot can be inferred given just how an area is laid out, how a character is placed, and whatnot. This kind of subtlety does remind me of how sometimes Dark Souls tells stories for namely those who are really playing attention, without even cracking one word of dialogue at times - except, this game never cracks one word of dialogue.\n\nWhen played with a X360 controller (which is how I played this game), the player controls one brother w/ the left stick + interact w/ object w/ one of the left triggers, while the other brothers is controlled w/ the right stick + one of the right triggers. Nothing else I can think of feels like this, gameplay-wise. This feels extremely unique, in which you are basically playing a Co-Op style game...basically all by your lonesome self. It's genius and absolutely brilliant. You will need to control each brother at the right time sometimes; simultaneously sometimes (which can be confusing at first, and then joyous and awesome once you get the feel down correctly and execute a set-piece correctly); or do things in a certain manner to advance further in the game and story.\n\nAll of the set pieces here are fantastic and extremely well put together. From every story set-piece to every gameplay set-piece, everything is put together in such a manner in which it's integrated extremely well with each other. Each brother has their own advantages and disadvantages - one brother is much taller + stronger, while the other brother is smaller + skinnier. This can help lead players on how to figure out what to do in certain situations + encounters. Maybe the big brother needs to give the little brother a boost, so they can reach a ledge. Maybe the younger brother can squeeze through bars that his bigger brother can't get between. Thankfully, the puzzles aren't hard, obscure, or ridiculous - but the player likely will have a bunch of "Aha!" moments, once the players realize how to make the brothers work together in the correct context and manner. Everything (difficulty-wise) is, as Goldilocks would say, "just right."\n\nWhile it likely won't take players likely very long to finish, Brothers is an absolutely unforgettable journey that must be experienced. Players will be moved by this fantastic experience, once it reaches its jaw-dropping conclusion. Taking my time, it took me somewhere around 4-5 hours to finish. It is a delightful experience, every single solitary step of the way. This game should be experienced by every gamer and should not be missed. This story-book, fairytale-like, and fable-like experience here is brought to life absolutely beautifully.\n\nGrade: A.","February 19, 2014","true","6.1"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","1"

The entire thing is like a gorgeous painting.\nAt core, the puzzles are all simple, but the variety and variations kept things fresh and enjoyable.\nScenes and panoramas ... just incredible. My favorite parts was when the camera would show you an area that you had just traipsed through 5-10 minutes before.\nLevel design. Incredible variety. Pastures, mountains, battlefields. The part where the ogre(?) is helping you climb a mountain is very clever. The battlefield ... awesome and a bit twisted. There are zip lines (for lack of a better term), boats, hang-gliding, goat-riding ... I forgot about the goat-riding!\nShort but sweet. Just a ton of goodness compacted into a game that's decent length. I wouldn't want it shorter, and there's just no need to stretch it out. Well, I wouldn't complain if the developers cut the last level ... some of it was just unnecessary.\nWhat I didn't like:\nI didn't like controlling the boat.\nI really, really didn't like the last level. I get that the developers want to drive in some emotion, but the stuff they have your character do after collecting the medicine was just effed up.\nAll in all, a great game. Even the stuff I didn't like was very minor in the whole scheme of things and doesn't take away from the sheer amazement you get. Incredible game. I really can't see the developers topping this gem.\n\nIn some ways, I might even consider this to be the best indie game ever.

It is more an experience rather than a game. It is the most emotionally charged game to an extent where it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Brothers operates with a beautifully spare efficiency in every aspect of its narrative and design, propelling you through a striking storybook landscape in which gameplay mechanics and thematic storytelling thread together more tightly than most games can manage. The resulting journey is so singularly devoted to creating a specific tone and atmosphere that you won't likely be able to stop thinking about it until long after you've seen it through to the end. And it surprisingly excels at this without saying a single word and without forcing anything upon you. It is really understandable that it would be the Game of the Year and is already a personal choice of famous youtubers. It is clearly my Game of the Year. Dont't watch it, play it. This game will impact you in a way that no other game ever did. Lock your door, plug in your controller and start Brothers. Play it in one sitting, it is a 2 and half to 3 hour journey.

Having an older brother myself, the game made me genuinely grieve, even cry.\nBrothers touches on so many of those feelings that really matter in life, both negative and positive: grief, guilt, shame, loss, even betrayal, but also joy, trust, love, and most of all, forgiveness. The writing in this game is a stroke of genius, especially when considering that Brothers accomplishes all this without anyone in the game ever uttering a single (meaningful) word.

"A man, clinging to life. His two sons, desperate to cure their ailing father, are left with but one option..."\n\n.. that's right, to go on an epic bro-tastic quest to save him!\n\nStarbreeze studios have created a fantasy world in Brothers that oozes with vibrance, life & atmosphere that really makes the world come alive. This is complemented by excellently detailed character animations & enviromental/weather effects that give additional impact to every scene (and they look really good!). Camera selection/direction is fluid & enhances each specific scene, drawing attention to a beautiful vista or the next path to take. There are also park benches throughout the game, where the bros can sit to view the gorgeous panoramic scenery. This was a really nice touch!\n\nEach controller stick & trigger controls each brother independantly (Left for big bro, Right for lil bro). Dubbed as 'Single player Co-op', this mode of play makes for some interesting gameplay mechanics & puzzle solving challenges (not to mention the challenge of actually coordinating your brain to control two players at once!). Its not that easy trust me lol! The rest of the game in general is very forgiving & overall isn't too puzzling &/or difficult to complete.\n\nExploring, you can find some fun Easter Eggs, some relating to achievements, but others that are just there to make you smile and have a fun moment :)\n\nFor me, the real stand out feature in Brothers was the story, which is a bit strange to say really, as there is actually no understandable dialog in the entire game! Everyone speaks a gibberish language you cannot understand. This actually works in the game's favor due to the quality animation & scene direction; you just understand what is going on naturally & the details of it all become irrelevant. Interestingly, the emotions become more relevant as you watch the brother's story unfold.\n\nIt's impressive storytelling, exploring (among other things) family, sacrifice & loss, helping others & overcoming fears, along with some heartwarming & heartbreaking moments too. All moving you forward to the unforgettable conclusion (which might just stick with you for a while).\n\nOverall, Brothers has smooth & relaxing gameplay, devoid of any of those frustrating gamer moments. Impressive graphics, quality sound effects & a musical score that drives the emotional impact throughout extremely well. It's a short, but memorable 4-5 hour experience with immersive storytelling & plenty of adventurous 'Indiana Jones & Tomb Raider-esque' action sequences to enjoy.\n\nGreat bro-tastic experience!

Let first say to anyone looking for a short review, "Buy this game. It is 100% worth any money you will spend on it." I would also like to take a humble moment to confess that this game made me cry. Yes, I cried.\n\nNow that the confession is out of the way, this game is a work of art. The story telling in this game is so fulfilling that the fact that story includes no dialogue only adds to the art form.\n\nThe player is greeted in the beginning with horrifying story of a boy not able to save his mother from drowning and having to deal with emotional stress as a young child. The story continues by giving the two brothers the task of curing their sick father. The story itself is an adventure in emotion and storytelling. The brothers venture off into an unknown world coming across all sorts of different people and creatures, both needing help and helping the brothers along the way. A wonderful part of the story is the side stories that you stumble upon that have nothing to do with main plot. It’s a rich element of character to an already impressive story.\n\nFor the second part of this review, let’s talk about the controls. The game is designed to use an Xbox style of controller utilizing the analog sticks to individually control each brother. Interaction with the environment is as simple as pressing the triggers, one for each brother. It is a lesson in coordination that for this guy was occasionally challenging. If the brothers swapped sides on the screen from the layout of the control sticks, it confused my thumbs. But I would not give up the uniqueness of these controls.\n\nThis may have been a short game (approx. 4-5 hours) but the story and cinematography outshined anything.

I played it a while back and wrote a half-♥♥♥♥♥ review that didn't really portray how much I enjoyed this game. A few of the generalized points about why I love it:\n\nFirst, the graphics. The use of the Unreal Engine 3 is really taken advantage of, with some incredible lighting and unbelievable physics. It is a very colorful game that is very immersive.\n\nSecond, the controls. The fact that I prefer a controller helped in appreciating the gameplay a lot more. In this game, one controls both brothers - at the same time. That's right, no switching back-and-forth between them. It is why a controller is required (though I've heard of people using keyboards somehow), because you need the two joysticks. When controlling both brothers at the same time, it is noticable that the older brother has assets while the younger brother is weak.\n\nThird, the storyline. There are not many games that are able to choke people up (emotionally). This is one game that was, at the very least, able to choke me up (even if it was just at the end). The story is about a widowed ill father, and about his two sons travelling far and wide to reach a cure. When the characters talk in the game, it is an unknown language. But even when people do not speak the same language, when they feel strongly about something and speak to you anyways, you may just understand what they said.\n\nIn the end, this is a very nice game.

Ofc some tiems it lucks into some controls or graphice, you cannot make it run 1080p HD but itt looks so pretty and smooth.\n\nI got it on sales, so i didn't pay much, which made me enjoy it even more!

Rarer still is a game which blends those emotional experiences so seemlessly with the gameplay mechanics instead of shoving it down your throat in lengthy cutscenes. Brothers is a shining example of a successful blend of story and mechanics. The game's puzzles are well designed and feel satisfying to solve, almost always making use of the 'one player coop' asymmetry between the characters in unique and celver ways to progress through the game. Brother's Environments are extremely varied from grand mountain vistas to muted yet intricate caves. It feels like a world teeming with interesting fables and legend, yet the game insists on leaving lore and backstory to your imagination. This means the pacing feels pretty impecible throughout.\n\nNow, the game's characters don't speak a word of English. Pretty much all of the communication between characters is done via body language. This perhaps sounds a little pretentious - but it works SO much better this way. Never did I feel like I didn't understand what a character was trying to communicate. Admittedly it was jarring at first, but after a half hour you'll start to see why this method of communication works in harmony with the game.\n\nI won't spoil what makes up this game's 'emotional' qualities. - and I know you want to punch me in the face for saying "emotional qualities". Just know that Brothers isn't just a sad game. Quite the opposite, it makes you feel a range of emotions. This game is funny, charming, thoughtful and touching. For me personally it's had a greater emotional impact in its 4 hour length than any film, book or indeed game I've ever played. All that whilst not saying a single word of English. Do yourself a favour, lock yourself away for a few hours, play this game from start to finish and immerse yourself in the story.\n\nAs a final note - I would recommend playing this game with a gamepad. Wait! Don't through your pitchforks yet! The game still plays on a keyboard - though this game feels like it's built for a controller in mind. I would argue that keyboard control would detract from experience, and I'm pretty damn ardent about mah keyboard n' mouse.","November 14, 2014","true","3.4"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","3"

It's short and very linear, but it's also airtight, perfectly paced and not a moment of it feels superfluous. While platforming is easy and puzzle soultions are almost always very obvious, main challenge comes from mastering games unique dual-control gameplay (you control one brother with each analog stick and that's why GAMEPAD IS A MUST). To me it was relatively easy but some less patient players may be discouraged from properly enjoying it. However, that would be to their own detriment, because despite it's shortness (and subsequently relatively high price) it provides a unique experience and narrative (reactions and dialogue are communicated exclusively through mime and vocal inflections) which should be experienced and appreciated by anyone who loves puzzle-adventures or just wants a well-crafted, story driven game.","June 26, 2014","true","4.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

I give the developers full credit for creating some astonishingly beautiful visuals, which truly enable the fairy tale world of the game to come to life. I was swept away by breathtaking vistas of misty valleys and snow-capped mountains, as well as some of the most gorgeous water effects I've ever seen in a video game.\n\nThat being said, I didn't find any other aspect of this title to be particularly noteworthy or enjoyable. The puzzles are extremely simplistic and I was never, even for a moment, at loss as to how to proceed. This simplicity might lead one to think that this could be a good game for kids, but the grim tone and surprisingly gruesome middle section quickly put that idea to rest.\n\nI question the decision to implement a made up "language" for the characters to use to express themselves. I think it badly detracts from the seriousness of the story. I would have preferred either no dialog at all (pantomime would probably have been sufficient) or some concise dialog/narration in a real language. Perhaps something written in a fairy tale style would have fit the mood of the game perfectly.\n\nFinally, I have to take major issue with the ending. I think the developers were going for grand operatic tragedy, but because of the complete lack of characterization things fall totally flat. The shrill and melodramatic music that underscores "big" moments makes the lack of true drama all the more obvious and jarring.\n\nI'm sure many people will enjoy Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, but based on my own taste in games and art in general I don't find anything to recommend here.","November 27, 2013","false","2.9"," 510 of 902 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","510","902","2","18"

It is an incredible story of loss and growth set in an utterly realized yet fantastical world.  Sometimes controlling the brothers at the same time is confusing (it's the video game equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time), but it is not enough to take away from this journey.

Let's analyze everything, shall we?\n\nThe gameplay is pretty innovative yet so easy: left stick + L2 to control a brother, right stick + R2 to move the other one. Each of them will have his own ability, like the big brother will move heavy stuff, and the small one will pass through tiny bars. Might look a little too hard to control at the biginning, but you'll get used to it pretty fast. But you'll probably get stuck sometimes or die like an idiot becouse you can't tell witch kid you're actually moving. Probably it was just me becouse I'm terrible with a controller.\n\nAnyway, the story itself is pretty easy, but the small events that you will encounter, most of them well hidden, are really well written. Some scenarios are really, really impressive and I think I never saw something like that, like  the Valley of the  dead giants .\n\nThere aren't many enemies this this game, but a lot of jumping puzzles and puzzles itself. Not much difficult, but still a lot of  fun to play. There will be also some boss battles, but not much of a challange.\n\nThe music is really great, I love it and really know where to hit the spot. Really well chosen for certain moments.\n\nThe only thing that kinda disappoint me are some few bugs that I encounter: for exemple, once I got stuck into a rock, and i couldn't move from that. Had to restart from last checkpoint. Immersion broken.\n\n\nIn the end, this game get for me a whole 8/10\n\nIs great, go get it now. Maybe better get that on sale, is an awesome game, but 15€ might be a little too much, but that won't be a problem.","January 8, 2014","true","4.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The story is a simple one - your father needs help desperately, and you have to go find it.  Throughout the journey you'll feel many emotions as you quickly grow attached to the brothers.  This attachment is due to the fact that you control both brothers at the same time and you need to have them work together to fight through adversity and move on in your journey.  The lack of lengthy cut-scenes and a made-up language were interesting choices that also worked 100% with this game.  It makes you become even more involved, not just sit back and watch a movie play out in a game.\n\nGraphics-wise, it's visually beautiful without the need of heavy tweaking.  The game environment immerses you to its fantasy world instantly.  Houses, farms, towns, cliffs, castles, mines, caves, water... all the environments are well-made and polished.  The way you get to interact with animals in particular was phenomenal in my opinion.  A lot of small interactions with people, items, and animals are not necessary to move on in your journey, but they add fun and depth to the game experience and gets you even more immersed.\n\nIt's recommended that you play with a controller, and I could see why.  You control one brother with each joystick, and a lot of times you'll need to interact with both at exactly the same time to solve puzzles.  I thought that the teamwork between the brothers was spectacular, and not something you see every day in a single player game.  No gameplay bugs or annoyances to speak of.  You just need to learn to work together with yourself :)  The puzzles themselves are very simple, yet brilliant in how you go about to solving them.\n\nAll achievements are fun to attain, not a chore.  If you missed an achievement during your first playthrough, you can go back and play each chapter separately.  I finished the game in 4 hours.  Others have finished it between 2 and 6 hours.  The game was so much fun that I purposely had to put it down so that I didn't play through it in one sit-down.\n\nI'm not going to spoil anything whatsoever regarding the story.  All I'll say is that you'll experience many up's and down's throughout the journey.  Which again, it's something that the game got 100% right.  Right now I can't think of a single negative to speak of.  I guess the game length would be the only negative since it's such a great and fun game that you'll wish the journey had lasted longer.\n\nA reviewer at TotalBiscuit called Brothers the best game he's ever played, surpassing his previous choice (Deus Ex).  I also happen to think that Deus Ex is one of, if not the best game ever made.  I do understand why he would place Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons so high up the game ladder.  I haven't played The Last of Us yet, but I would strongly make a case for Brothers as a 2013 Game of the Year candidate.  I'm not a recognized game reviewer person or site, so it's just my humble opinion.  But go ahead and buy Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons if you want a great, emotional gaming experience :)","December 21, 2013","true","4.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

Great story, amazing graphics, beautiful music, and very rewarding to play. Although people have found ways to make it work without one, you will definitely need a controller to get the full experience (preferably one with feedback/vibration turned on and also 2 analog sticks, I used an Xbox 360 controller).\n\nIt's a very short game and probably doesn't have a lot of replay value (though I personally may want to play through it again and again every so often, the way you go back and read a book you really love every few years), but it's an experience that I think will stay with you long after you finish playing.\n\nAt first, I thought the controls were going to be awkward, but the interface is so simple and the story is so compelling that you really do get lost in the game and the controls feel very natural. The puzzles are intuitive and not too difficult, and unlike a lot of games I never found myself frustrated because something was too hard or I couldn't figure out what the next step was. I also never felt like the puzzles were too repetitive (even though some elements do repeat) because the environment keeps changing enough to keep things interesting.\n\nOverall this game was a pleasure to play and very very satisfying.

Actually not just "good" things, I had heard great things. So I decided that I wanted to try it out, and now I can only take part in the joy, of confirming the awesomeness that is this game.\n\nThe only thing, that people kept repeating, that's pulling this game a small bit down, is the fact that it only takes about 3-4 hours to beat. I did it in one sitting, and on one hand, it's great to have a short game, with a nice storyline. It always feels good to finish a game, and it's healthy if you tend to have a quickly growing backlog. But on the other hand, it's also nice to have a game, that's abit long, you get to follow the charaters for longer, and get more into the story. Plus, if it's a good game, then there's the obvious advantage of extra gaming content. (When I'm saying a long game, I'm not talking skyrim long, just with a bit more of an ellaborated story). But in the end, I don't think that this game needs to be any longer, in the matter of a fact, I think it has the perfect length, you get a nice insight in the game and the two brothers' adventure to reach their goal.\n\nOne thing I found really special and unique in this game, is how it manages to create that feeling, of sympathy, and understanding. Even though it's in a completely foreign language. In fact, I pictured myself in their roles so much, that I even started refering to myself in plural. This is definatly one of the most emotional games, I have ever played. At parts, it got me directly sad.\n\nEven though this game at the store page, has a note saying "notice: this game requires a controller" this is actually not the case. I started this game up, using my gamepad, and given you're playing as two charaters, it takes a second to get used to the double controls. Especially when the brothers switch side of the screen. Anyways, half way into the game, i decided "hmm, maybe i should try using my keyboard, just for the sake of testing if it works." And it does, and while many say that the keyboard controls are much more difficult to use, i actually found it completely opposite, and stuck with it for the rest of the game.\n\nThe graphics in this game is astonishing, and all over fantastic. Brothers is all over a beautiful game http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233645061 and not only that, the tremendous amount of stuff you could interact with, simply made the game even funnier, even the two brothes had different ways of ineraction, it was an exploration in itself, just walking around, and watching them react to stuff.\n\nYou start the game with a cutscene, where you tragically see the mother die at sea. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233539752 Afterwards, you slowly fade back into presence. You're playing as two brothers, who has bring their ill father some healing water from the tree of life (atleast that's what it's called in my head xD). They have to pass and solve countless tests and challenges by the use of teamwork and some nice parkour, you start of in your home town, getting slowed down by a simple town-bully, but are yet to find out there are far worse things to worry about, giant trolls, even bigger spiders, invisble snow creatures and all sorts of monsters awaits the two boys, and before they finally reach the tree, they have to survive all these things. and just when you think all is good, twists are happening all around you (no spoilers, go play for yourself)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233640820\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233641046\n\nWhile almost everything in this game is perfect, it feels like the devs. has done over one particular bit, abit quickly compared to the rest of the game, I'm talking about the soundtrack, while it too has some cool parts to it, I feel like it lags that one epic track, that makes you wanna play the game, over and over again, just for that track, or simply just makes you hum along to it.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 9/10 it's an amazing game, the developers did an incredible job on this game, it has every little aspect needed in my opinion, the only thing keeping it from perfection is the soundtrack.\n\nSo cheers Starbreeze Studios for this game\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233640379\n\nalso, have a few pics :eng: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233897403 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233653659 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233647495","March 2, 2014","true","3.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/225080/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","Brothers is a game where you control two brothers on a quest to save their father. The game is optomized with an Xbox 360 controller in mind, no doubt. Or at the very least, a controller. It can definitely be played with a keyboard and mouse, but I wouldn't recommend.\n\nNow that I got that out of the way, I'll let you know why(if you didn't already know) this is one of the best games of the year. The way you control both brothers binds with the story so well its absolutely amazing. We all know when it comes to gaming there are two basic factors that make a video game: Mechanics and story. I think a game can have very little of one or the other, and still be a good game. However, it is extremely rare that the mechanics practically make the story. Its absolutely amazing how well it is done. I'm fairly sure its been done in similar ways before, but not in a way like this, in a way that makes the story what it is. The story wouldn't exist without the mechanics, its amazing how they flow.\n\nThere is no dialouge, yet the story is one of the best I've played. How the hell does that even happen? It completely took me by surprise. I didn't think that was possible until Journey, and now Brothers has done a very similar thing.\n\nTo be honest, while the mechanics do make the story, they don't come without bugs and issues. There were several times where the controls got in the way of me being able to complete a task. I don't entirely blame the game, I blame my brain for not always being able to keep track of both characters and coorespond that with the correct stick on the controller. Also, I ran into a few different glitches, but nothing broke my game. However I have heard of glitches forcing some people to restart entire chapters, which is not ideal.\n\nI'm not going to tell you this is my favorite game of all time, or even my #1 game of the year, but that doesn't mean the game isn't amazing and plenty of fun. I would have been happy paying the full sale price, but at $4.49, its an absolute steal. Brothers gets my full recommendation.

It doesn't try to appeal to everyone and is better for it. Its main strength is its highly emotional story which is hard to talk about without spoiling anything. I can only say that it managed to surprise me more than once. It's about 3 hours long which might seem short on paper but you won't be bored for a single minute and the impact it makes will stay with you a great deal longer. It's designed to be played as a "single player co-op game" but I played it with my younger brother for an extra layer of immersion and we both had a wonderful time throughout. The game doesn't actually "need" a controller to work but using a keyboard is a bad idea as it takes away much of the gameplay value. I had to use an emulator to get my old controller to work with the game but it was well worth the trouble. All in all I'd say it's more than worth the price and the 3 hours of your life as it will most likely enchant your whole evening like it did mine.","December 28, 2013","true","3.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

It carries you through a fantastical world never uncertain of what it wants you to see and feel, and does so in such a effective manner that it never needs to say anything to make you connect with your two characters, and leave a lasting impression.\n\nBrothers story is not one that can be spelled out on paper, and really does require you to experience it for yourself in order to understand why it is so powerful. The way in which each piece is woven and rewoven together creates a world that feels connected and draw out despite the immense ground covered and the drastic changes undergone by the environment, as well as the short length which leaves little time for exposition. I honestly do not feel capable of doing it any sort of justice with this review, but know that this is the type of narrative journey that comes along rarely for a reason, that being it is very hard to do successfully especially to such a level as is shown here.\n\nI once read the way A Tale of Two Sons plays described as "single player co-op" which is the perfect definition for it. You control both brothers concurrently with the two analog sticks and triggers. It's a disorienting rewiring of the motions we've become so accustomed to and requires you use both sides of your brain at once, but once you get accustomed it allows for an array of increasingly ingenious occurrences. The ways in which it forces you to work together (with yourself) are brilliant and within the first opening moments completely sold me on the unusual control scheme and only continued to impress me with the cleverness that the developers managed to play with mechanic.\n\nAs compelling as I found the gameplay, I was simply struck by the unequivocal beauty of the visuals. The texture work and lighting effects bring the prodigious creativity and imagination to life in a vibrant and ever changing display of wondrous locals and characters. The breathtaking and dramatic soundtrack is perfectly timed to every action that occurs, with a dynamic range of sounds that sweeps you through the world as an irreplaceable part of it.\n\nThere are few games which I feel deserve the title, but the level at which Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons accomplishes everything it attempts and the skill in which it executes the different components, warrants the term masterpiece. It is an impressive achievement in both interactive storytelling and original game design that left me in a state of wonder with each passing moment. Disregard the fact that you can and likely will complete it in one sitting, Brothers is something that needs to be played and a game I will surely be singing the praises of far into the future.","December 31, 2013","true","2.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/recommended/225080/","jipearce82","Senno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/","755 products in account","Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons opens and closes with death. It’s a game about death. But it isn’t a game about killing. What is between the opening and closing scenes is a dark fairytale world full of mature themes, and the bond of two siblings as they struggle valiantly on a quest to save their withering father. A beautiful and melancholic journey awaits you, and a deep emotional investment will be required. And though brief, this attractive storybook adventure is as dreamlike as it is affecting.\n\nBrothers’ appeal lies in what it doesn’t tell you. Cutscenes are used sparingly, with the world itself providing the emotional pull and story. For instance, while I was using the twin-control scheme to explore a town, I was able to steal a ball and throw it down a well, leaving a small girl in tears. The imaginary language used by the characters is universally bolstered by wonderful body language, and the affection and fears that each brother holds for the other.\n\nThe twin-control scheme is key to the game’s identity. It’s a somewhat clumsy control system, with each brother being assigned to a control stick and a shoulder button. However, Brothers’ generally requires the input of both characters, both to work together and independently, to pass obstacles. It’s a key identifying feature for the game and one that has been cleverly exploited.\n\nThe obstacles are generally rather easy, and there is only a small amount of room to experiment, with generally one rather obvious solution. The challenge comes in actually performing the actions necessary to pass. As you control both brothers at the same time, and often you need to split them up to do individual tasks, some of which can be timed, it can occasionally feel like trying to pat your head and rub your belly at once. Something that for most of us, we are certainly capable, but it does require a different type of input than we would normally use.\n\nAnd these siblings will certainly have you wringing your hands. Sometimes over the controls, but mostly over their relationship with each other, and in turn, your relationship with them. The epic undertaking they’re on will have them trek over snow-capped mountains, across frozen lakes and an ancient giant’s battlefield – it’s a wonderfully realised world without exposition – it exists and feels real. The settings are as varied as the tasks required of the brothers, and the emotional pull of the game will have you powering on to see what happens next. This is not a game to be played in short stretches, and at just over 3 hours in my playthrough, I completed it in just two sittings.\n\nThe dark undercurrent of death in this world is never confrontational, it seeps into every pore of the game, and can even be missed. Shortly after leaving a small village, I passed a man attempting to hang himself. Using one brother to prop him up, and another to cut the rope, I left him sitting beneath the tree to sob like a man who had nothing left. Further ahead I found a burnt out homestead, and with the brothers working in tandem, I was able to retrieve a small music-box which seemed to help the man. This sentimental scene is one of many throughout Brothers’ that outright dealt with death in a mature and intelligent fashion, an unusual but fascinating design decision by the developers.\n\nI suppose you could say that the true aim of Brothers’ is to make us feel. Of course, there is the adventure, and the smartly designed environmental obstacles, but this is a game where touch isn’t just an afterthought, and death has some permanence, and has some resonance. And while it’s brief, Brothers’ doesn’t outstay it’s welcome, and provides an ambitious, emotionally affecting adventure that while short, is very sweet. Memorable.\n\n8.5/10.","January 12, 2014","true","7.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aleonymous/recommended/225080/","aleonymous","Aleonymous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aleonymous/","90 products in account","Brothers is a story-driven action/3D-platformer adventure. You guide two sons across a dark fairy-tale realm, in search of a magical ingredient that will save their widowed father from an illness.\n\n- Gameplay is what makes this game unique: You control both brothers with a single gamepad (highly recommended), using the analogue sticks to move the brothers and one button to interact with the world. That's all! You'll need to synchronize the brothers' actions and use each ones advantages to move across the story. You can also play co-op, e.g. one player on keyboard and the other on gamepad. The puzzles are usually pretty simple to figure out, but some can be a bit hard to pull off. But, don't worry, the game autosaves frequently, so you can die as much you want. Finally, note that there's no text in this game, neither written nor spoken: there's some made-up language heard, but you'll only have visual clues about what to do next.\n\n- Story is linear, simple but beautiful. The world-theme might seem like a fairy tale, but be warned that there's a lot of mature content in the game. Tears came to my eyes several times, but there was also a few laughs :) Note that the game is a bit short, i.e. it takes 3-5hrs to complete it. I did a second playthrough to get the achievements, which were usually small branches off the main story, that you might not notice.\n\n- Visuals are FANTASTIC; Unreal Engine at its best. Can't really describe this, so you'll just have dive into the story and get blown away! The world is magnificent and varying, in the ~8 chapters of the story. The camera-rotation is smooth but might be annoying to some.\n\n- Audio is fine in overall. The music is beautiful, but not omni-present in the game; I think it could do with more music. As I said, there's some made-up language used in the game, which might annoy you at times: The brothers have a tendency to call out to one-another when they're separated!\n\nI highly recommend this game to lovers of action-adventures, with a sensitive vein.\n\nEDIT -- The controls worked right, with the exception of one (non game-breaking) glitch: Sometimes the big brother would interact with the world (thus re-starting small cut-scenes) when I moved both brothers in tight spaces with the analog sticks. This was most likely due to me using x360ce emulator to make my PS-styled gamepad compatible with the game.","March 22, 2015","true","7.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The art direction, soundtrack, color patterns, interaction with the world, controls... everything is beautiful. Especially interactions and the responses of the items or people (wouldn't like to call them NPC's in such a game) depending on the brother you're interacting at that time makes this game astonishingly brilliant. Being directly involved  in some major happenings (like at the giant tree, near the end of the game) makes it more than a simple platformer and enhances the game's influence on your emotions as you are doing those specific actions.  Preference of using the player's involvement rather than showing those kinds of events as cutscenes turns this simple story to a bond between the game and the gamer.\n\nOnly negative points are:\nMostly holding LT and RT buttons might become tiring for fingers after a while.\nController direction settings are set for XBOX gamepads, which are different than most of the gamepads on the market in terms of locations of digital and analog movement buttons, therefore while you're controlling a brother with analog, you'll control the other with digital and this kinda diminishes the revolutionary control system.\nGame is too short and would love to play more of this.\nPuzzles could have been harder (?).\n\n\nAt the end, it is a great experience to participate in the tale of two brothers.","October 12, 2014","true","4.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Main plot is glorious and consists of different little stories you can discover (or miss) on your way. It also has a lot of symbolism which is often a part of gameplay. Some people say that it's too short (around 5 hours), but in my opinion the length of the game is ideal for the story being told. It brings new elements of gameplay in every chapter, so you simply have no time to get bored with them. It keeps the game interesting until the very end even if you don't like the plot (what is unlikely). The game also provides picturesque landscapes like every 5 minutes.\n\nTechnically it's a platformer with some little puzzles. Unique feature of the game is controlling two characters at the same time. It can seem difficult at first and it definitely needs more coordination, but controls are simple and very well done. In overall the game isn't hard to beat. Game runs well on old systems (see system requirements).

There's nothing terribly complex or unique about it, but at the same time there's something endearing to it. It's a brief experence, to its benefit, and no part of the game overstays its welcome, I feel. Mechanics that utilize the two-character controls are introduced and dropped before they get stale. The general "plot" is pretty unremarkable, but like any fairy tale I wasn't really expecting it to be super special.\n\nThe artstyle is pretty simple but the landscapes do look pretty great. There's little benches strewn about that do nothing but pan over the vistas, but you'll find youself wanting to sit in them for a bit anyways. The music is also pretty good, especially during chapters 3 and 4. but by the end of the game I found myself wishing there was a little more variety to it.\n\nLocales are kind of connected together in a way that doesn't seem terribly cohesive, but the variety in types of places that you visit, especially for such a short game, it pretty nice.  I also like that the achievements are just little extra/optional things that you'll find yourself doing in the world naturally without searching around corners and stuff for game-y collectables or something.\n\nNot too much of a time investment to experience and no frustration.

And I am so glad that I decided to play this today. I absolutely loved it. I hated that the game made me dug a grave for my brother and buried him too, because it made me extra sad, but I loved the game in its entirety.\n\nWorth buying at full price. A steal, if you can get it in a sale.\n\nMy Rating: 10/10","February 13","true","3.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

Once I found out it was sort of a puzzle type that drew me in a bit more… Then it magically showed up on sale during this previous Summer Sale and I said why not, no harm done. It’s cheap as heck, why not give it a go now… and it turned out to be the best game I’ve played in a long while!\n\nAt first I felt a bit put off by the controls [simply because I’ve never really had to use two pads at once before], but the visuals were great enough to keep me occupied. The art style of this game is far beyond superb, and I couldn’t stop sitting for a while and just absorbing the surroundings.  After getting the hang of things and learning the motions the story line and adventure began.\n\nThis is where I got the most drawn in, the characters are all likeable and unique. Even the side characters had some flavor to them I loved exploring [and plan to return to again] some of the people I ran across throughout my adventure. The more I progressed the more I really felt I was watching some sort of movie of an actual adventure of two brothers that were on a quest to save their father.\n\nI like to keep these reviews short, and not give away too many details so that one could enjoy it themselves in game. I’d highly recommend this to any person Gamer or not. No matter your preferred game style… if you enjoy fun characters, amazing stories, stunning visuals, and fun puzzles… You will love this game.\n\nBuy it full price, or at discount. If I knew what I did now, and had to ask myself if I would have paid full: I sure as hell would have.","June 30, 2014","true","5.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

This is a gem thats worth your money.\n\nIt's not long and the achievements are fairly easy but for a 4~hour story its worth it. the controll system is confusing at first but it fun to adapt too. The story and sounds are the Highlight of the game for me.

The game uses limited interactions but enough to make you feel involved in the story. You follow two brothers as they try to save their Dad.  You need a controller to better control both brothers at once. It took me about 3 hours but there are a few achievments to search for afterwards if you are that way inclined, maybe adding another couple of hours to your gametime.

When I think of timeless, classic video games, I immediately think of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Metal Gear Solid 3; video games that left a truly lasting impression on you that you won't soon forget.  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a masterful piece of work that leaves you emotional, heavy-hearted, and awe-inspired.\n\nDevelopers and Credits\n\nJosef Fares is the creator and lead director of Starbreeze Studios on this project and it is worth mentioning that this is the man to follow for years to come.  There was a time when Starbreeze was one of the most talented developers out there, responsible for video games like The Darkness.  Even though not much of the original team is left, I am happy to see that they are returning to their roots.  This is a prime example of why Starbreeze creates games that defy the conventional standard that is demanded by big-house pubishers.  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a love-letter to gamers and it does not miss a beat.\n\nStorytelling\n\nThere are many games on the market that try too hard to get its point across but stumbles and fails.  Brothers is a game that says very little and it instead tells the story and narrative through visual imagery, action, and stunning sequences of events that connect with a purpose.  The characters in the video game speak "made-up" language but you can translate in your mind what they are trying to say because all words are committed with purposeful action and even inaction.  It does not "say" much but when the words do come out, they are powerful, metaphorical, and full of meaning.\n\nIf you are a thinker of life, its philosophies, and its many different viewpoints, you will appreciate this game to its core.  Brothers explores the lost of loved ones, rebirth, and transcendence.  It is a deep, thought-provoking piece of work that dares to convey ideas that most video games run away from.  When you are done playing Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, it will steal away your heart and leave your soul very heavy.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe multi-faceted gameplay combines platforming, puzzles, and controls in a new and innovative way.  The platforming on the surface might not seem like anything new but due to the control scheme using twin-sticks, it changes the game completely.  You control one brother with the left stick and one brother with the right stick for movement.  This is the same for the left and right triggers, respectively.  You need to have pretty good hand-eye coordination but it is a very slight learning curve.  After a few minutes, you will ease right in without an issue.\n\nI have not played a game with a control scheme like this, ever, and I have played hundreds of video games.  It lends itself intuitively to puzzles that are light to medium.  The puzzles require you think but they aren't headache-inducing because the point of the game is to let you enjoy a beautiful journey and memorable experience.  Puzzles are clever, smart, and they all involve the interaction and cooperation of the brothers.   This is not Uncharted or Super Mario but it combines some of those elements into the game.  Brothers consists of several different type of platforming techniques that you have not seen in any video game.  In the same light, the puzzles are unique as well.  It has never been done this way and it executes them extremely well.\n\nThe controls are very well-polished and intuitive to the point where you won't be frustrated or question it for a second.  Brothers avoids the plague of video games that are filled with hints and button tutorials that only get in the way.  It does not hold your hand.  There are no button prompts.  It asks you to understand the control scheme and play it to your problem-solving skills.  Basically, the designers does not assume that the player is stupid.  Hence why this game is a love-letter to the classic gamers.  You will appreciate this game to its fullest.  It requires you to figure things out on your own to solve well-crafted, clever puzzles that mesh successfully with the controls.\n\nWarning:  This game is pretty much controlpad-required.  Also, vibration from the controller (I will say since a long time ago) is important for this game.  The ending will not be the same great experience without the vibration feature.  Please buy a controller.\n\nVisuals\n\nHave you ever read a fairy tale book that contained some of the most beautiful visual imagery ever?  A huge part of Brother's storytelling is through its visual imagery.  It is like a fairy tale told through a video game with the use of a controller.  It is absolutely stunning, beautifully intelligent, and mesmerizing.  Throughout the entire game, I thought I was under a spell cast by a Wizard standing behind me whiled I played.  At times, you will wonder why other games do not like as gorgeous as this one.\n\nI am a very picky person when it comes to character, level, art design but I did not have one bone to pick with Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.  Every aspect of the visual design complimented each other.  The choice of colors really plays into color psychology.  One moment, the colors are bright and hopeful, and then the game takes you through dark tones that scares you, creates tension, and tosses you into some crushing moments.  It is one of the greatest displays of color and visual imagery, along with well-polished graphics that I have ever seen in a video game.\n\nDo the Achievements (Very Important)\n\nPlease look up the achievements online and do not worry about them being spoilers.  They are more like "sidequests" if anything but they are worth every second of your time.  I am not an achievement hunter AT ALL.  I am one of those gamers that love everything from hardcore, classic RPGs to light and fun action games, and of course indie games but I don't mind achievements as much as the next guy.  But you will want to grab all the achievements in this game and I'll tell you why in just a second.\n\nThe achievements in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons are heartwarming, time-worthy awards that question a gamer's morality, generosity, and heart.  You could be a hero, a rascal, explorer, humanitarian, or trouble-maker.  The choice is yours.  Making the right choice will get you a cool achievement that is worth your time.  It opens up cutscenes that you won't soon forget even after finishing the game.  Do them and enjoy the memories they create.\n\nThis text box cannot contain all of my words so I will leave you with a few words of thought.  This will easily be one of the games where I look back and I will remember playing it in great detail.  From beginning to end, it captured my heart.  It is a piece of art, game, media that knows how to make use of all its forms and it executes them all very well.  The ending is extremely powerful and it will tug at your heart strings.  Not many video games let alone forms of art, media, can ask you to question life's meanings.\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons is one of few games that has come close to bringing the player an existential experience.\n\n- Brilliant!\n- Timeless classic\n- Excellent adventure game\n- Game of the Year 2013\n\nRating: 9.6 out of 10","December 29, 2013","true","4.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","11"

You'll also encounter a lonely and sad troll-like being who helps you navigate the environment and whom in turn you help by rescuing his captured mate.

You control two brothers on a quest to find a cure for their ailing father, each brother controlled simultaneously with the left and right analog sticks on your controller (if ever there was an ad for getting a 360 / PS4 controller for your PC, this is it). It doesn't take long for your brain to adjust to this, although I found I had to keep the brothers on the same side as their analog stick to keep up! This isn't just a gimmick either, it really works, even to the extent of serving the story. There were times that I felt this was the best Tomb Raider game I'd played since the first one, that sense of edging around precarious drops and leaping between hand-holds, and the game exploits the co-op nature of your two characters well. It's also really spectacularly beautiful in places, and I kept wishing my Steam screen save button was working, but alas no. The game clocks in at just over three hours, but it feels right, almost like experiencing a great movie. The less said in any review about the actual story, though, the better.

It was like coming from a crash diet of Bawlz or Mountain Dew Amp, and switching to herbal tea.\n\nThe game concerns a simple story of two sons attempting to find a magic serum to heal their dying father. They meet with misadventure along the way, but never fail to stay the course. Told entirely through exposition (there is no discernable dialogue in the game whatsover) the player uses a gaming controller to control the actions of the two boys. One stick represents the taller and stronger brother who is able to assist his younger smaller brother into high places, and the other stick represents the smaller brother who is able to squeeze into tighter spaces to press levers, open gates, etc. to allow his older brother entry. A charming little tutorial starts the show and gently eases the player into the game mechanics. Don’t worry, it’s far easier than it sounds.\n\nI never had to access a walk through, and I only got stuck one time. I took a breath and reapproached the problem and then it came to me. I did die twenty-two times, but not once did I feel the game cheated. Death was usually a lesson learned.\n\nAnd strangely even though I died several times it was a relatively easy game to get through. The story is definitely the thing. Speaking of story, it unfurled before me and captivated me like watching Labyrinth, or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, or the obscure, The Company of Wolves. These are wonderful fantasy movies I saw in theaters years ago and remember never wanting them to end. This game isn’t a deep game, which isn’t a surprise considering its short playtime. It does, however, exude a wonderful ambience which is augmented by a beautiful soundtrack. If you’re a fan of Stars of the Lid or Sigur Ros you’ll find the soundtrack as splended as I did. At the story’s end I found myself a victim of my own emotions. I find it great that a computer game can make me feel that way. I want to revisit this place especially since it left me painfully pining for more background, lore and history of the wonderful place that could only exist in literature or art. This game is truly a testament to the old maxim, less is more.","April 8, 2015","true","5.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

A pc game that requires a controller to be playable; good or bad? Let's check it out:\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ Review ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nTwo sons don't get scared off by the unknown just to rescue their beloved but yet ill father. A journey throughout a place filled with fantasy and myths begins. But what starts so wonderful can change rapidly to the opposite...\n\nBrothers - A tale of two sons has not only a full controller support. It requires one in order to be playable. What sounds unfamiliar for a pc game turns out to be a fresh wind between all the pc master race games.\nCut down your e.g. X-BOX controller in half (warning: metaphorical!) and you get two contoll shematics, each for one of the sons.  The interesting part: the player is able to control both at the very same time. Whatsoever, here might lay the difficulty. You actually have to think about in which direction you want to let the big brother and the small one go, because now you don't have only one character to interact with the world.\n\nSpeaking of interacting with the world:\nBoth of the brothers have different abilities. While the bigger brother is stronger and able to switch a heavy lever the smaller brother is able to squeeze through fences to reach a special point. When the smaller brother can't reach a higher place, the bigger one is there to help. Every new area will present the brothers and the player with a new problem to tease out new abilities from them. But with this kind of teamwork you're able to solve puzzles smoothely.\nHint: always try to interact with everyone with each of the boys. Otherwise you might miss some fun!\n\nThe graphics are what the story is. All in all beautiful. You'll never feel like you could've been in that section before. Music and soundeffects always fit in the current situation you're in and emphasize to let you dive in the world of those two boys. Besides of that no real dialogue can be found. The speech from every character reminds of that one in e.g. Magica or even Sims. However, Brothers - A tale of two sons teaches us a very old lesson: a picture is worth a thousand words. You'll understand everything; from what the characters wants to tell the player to how they feel - even when it's just a simple mumbling.\n\nOne important matter that could be hold on to this wonderful game is the actual game length. You have to expect around 3-4 hours till you reached the very end of this game including all achievements. But even this few hours are worth the money and also time you've put in.\n\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ To keep a long story short ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nA fresh, emotional, sweeping and lovely journey about two sons, who try to find a cure for their ill father. This indie title shows how other indies should be.\n\nDon't let the controller requirement scare you off - you might miss a beautiful indie title with the right hit in the feelings. Even for around 15 Eur/$ and only 4 hours of gameplay you get a title filled with joy, sadness and fantasy. It's absolutely worth it!\n\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ Scoring ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nGameplay: 10.0/10.0\nGraphics: 9.0/10.0\nControls: 9.0/10.0\nSounds: 10.0/10.0\nGame Length: Aprox. 4 hours\nRecommendable: For deep story lovers and those who want to get a fresh wind in their game library absolutely recommended\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ Personal rating ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\n10.0/10.0","August 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

The story, character backgrounds and even your mission are shrouded in an unknown (probably gibberish) language, forcing you to rely on what the character's body language and surroundings are telling you. While it may seem difficult at first, the game does a marvelous job of keeping you on track and never feeling truly lost. It's a delicate balance that the game does quite well. I never felt lost, scrambling for what to do next.\n\nWithout delving too much into the plot (for fear of giving away any spoilers), the story is straight forward, but very powerful. As the game progressed, I couldn't help but feel connected to the brothers, their family and the cast of characters you meet along the way. Without language, you're not so much being told what is happening, but experiencing it first hand, which was a treat.\n\nVisually, the game is filled with eye candy. The environments are beautiful and change drastically as you progress, letting you see a plethora of sights - from charming villages to the aftermath of a war zone. It's as visually appealing as it is thought provoking. Overall, the game is enjoyable, albeit short. If you enjoy puzzle games with some emotional storytelling, I would highly recommend this game to you.\n\nPros\n\nStorytelling - The game has a unique way of guiding you without giving itself away. It's a refreshing alternative to spoken word.\nVisuals - The landscape is ever-changing, but always enjoyable. It leaves you with wonder and lets you fill in the gaps with your imagination.\nInteraction - Whether it be with other characters, animals or the environment itself, the game lets you interact with the world around you to let you understand each brother's personality.\nMusic - Simply put, the music is an auditory joy to listen to.\nCons\n\nGame Length - The game is short. I completed it in roughly 3.5 hours in one sitting. Some might be okay with that, some not so much. I was really hoping for more once I became invested in the characters.\nDifficulty - I found the game to be rather easy. I expected the puzzles to become progressively more difficult as the game carried on, but found they plateaued rather quickly.\n\nOverall, the pros heavily outweigh a few cons in my opinion. This one easily goes into my games recommendation list. It's a pleasure from start to finish.","July 7, 2015","true","3.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

No matter who you are and what kinds of games you like, you really should give this one a try. It's a must-play.\n\nThe game's biggest asset is the story and how the mechanics are interwined with the story. The game never offers too much of a challenge, but its innovative "each-stick-controls-one-character" approach is, at times, challenging enough to get used to. Once you get a hold of that, the puzzles are unlikely to stump you. This is a relaxing experience, which is there to be seen and played by yourself, while focusing on what's going on. Watching a playthrough of this short game is doing yourself an unimaginable disservice.\n\nPretty much everything else also works incredibly well in this game. The art direction and design proves to me again that video games do not need anything more than the tried-and-true Unreal Engine 3 - they "just" need imagination, and vision. Sure, it's easier to say that we need more detailed graphics and lightning effects to convey emotions and atmosphere, because that doesn't demand any artistic input in the game's style... well, Brothers is proof that this standpoint is plain wrong, and if a game has a boring visual design, not even next-gen graphics are going to make it look better than Brothers does. The game is gorgeous, and each of the different locations you'll visit is uniquely attractive, while conveying the theme in a near perfect way.\n\nThe soundtrack also helps a lot in building the game's atmosphere. It is one of the best I heard in recent years, and definitely unique in its own way. This is the first time I heard an OST so dipped in northern-european themes. The vocals do most of the heavy lifting to establish this feeling, but not a single track sounds like it doesn't fit into the overarching goal of the music. Not only a spot-on supplement to everything else in this game, it is an achievement on its own. You can buy the OST over at BandCamp and I highly recommend you do that.\n\nWhat more is there to say? This may not be the best game of all time, or even the most moving one, or the most influential one - but that doesn't change the fact that it is a must-have.","January 11, 2014","true","7.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The controls are really fun, though it took me a while to get used to - right analog stick/ trigger for the younger brother, and the left side for the older brother, it really feels like you're completing things and helping each other out.\n\nThe scenery is really good, but this brings out one of my main gripes with the game, the camera is pretty bad and although I can understand it's hard to have better camera control because you have two characters at once, there certainly could be improvement and the inconsistent camera movement (you can only turn the view right and left, and in many areas you can't even change the view) made me dizzy at times.\n\nAll in all, a good game that was way worth the 70% I got it at, but I wouldn't say it's a "must-play" or anything, just a pretty game with a decent story.","January 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/recommended/225080/","ladynarayan","Narayan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/","393 products in account",""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons" is a journey through fable-like world that focuses on inducing variety of emotions. The environment is very scenic, often having you traveling high up and admiring beautiful landscapes. It's inhabited with trolls, giants, griffins and other mythical creatures. Everywhere you go there's always something nice to look at. The camera's position often emphasizes the best fragments of a scene. It's not photo-real, but definitely eye pleasing and charming.\n\nYou control both brothers at once - left hand for the older one, right hand for the younger. Many puzzles rely on syncing them well together. For me that was something new. Personally I had to keep them on the left&right sides of the screen in accordance with the control scheme. Whenever they switched positions due to my running around, my brain just went out of whack and chaos followed. I had to slow down and reposition them to be able to continue comfortably.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are fairly easy. Some variants are recycled throughout the game. There is no greater planning involved and you solve many as you go. There is also no backtracking, so even if you're not sure how to tackle a specific problem, in most cases solution would present itself after simply going a little further. I feel that puzzles are just meant to be a way of reinforcing the bond between brothers and making player more attached through gameplay. Most of them require both protagonists working at the same time or in a longer alternating sequence.\n\nThe reception of the story differs from person to person. Many people got their hopes up by other reviews/opinions and were disappointed. Others were ecstatic. For me the general experience is above average, that's for sure. Also the ending squeezed a tear out of me or two, so the narration trough gameplay mostly did it's job. But I didn't experience strong emotional response from the beginning to the end like some. Still I find the whole journey enjoyable and well worth my time.\n\nThe game is pretty linear. No choices to be made, no events that can be prevented or played out differently. Apart from the main task that the boys are focused on, you can interact with many objects or NPCs and observe separate animations for each brother. Those do not affect anything, but make the world feel more alive and characters more fleshed out. All the inhabitants communicate in a made up gibberish sounding language, so the gestures and body language are especially important.\n\nThe whole world might look like it's fable-like, but in reality it's quite harsh. Brutal and cruel at times even. Good things happen, then bad things happen. You save someone, someone will die as a direct result of helping you (or even a worse scenario). One has the impression that no good deed goes unpunished. Sometimes you won't be able to help - you'll just witness the effects of a tragedy that already took place. You meet both friendly NPCs, and mean or outright ill willed & hostile ones. Although there are very few moments in the whole game that actually pose any danger (story wise, not from manually letting go a ledge or other mechanics associated deaths).\n\nCompleting the game takes about 3-4 hours, even when interacting with every possible object/person. So it's quite short. There is no need to replay it, other than experiencing the exact same story again if you really were swept away by it. If you have a chance to grab it on a sale - I wouldn't hesitate, fully recommended. At full price, I would say it's not for everyone. Definitely for people that can appreciate the emotional content and enjoy the journey aspect without making fuss about easy difficulty, length or minor issues - basically, recommended for informed customers :)\n\nSubjective Assessment - 7.5 (more than nice, not yet great)\n[utilizing full 1-10 scale, where 5 means average]","January 29, 2014","true","4.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

To begin with the story is beautiful and really well done. Without the risk of spoiling any of the story I can tell you it's about two sons who lives with their father who gets deadly sick one day and needs the special water from the Tree of Life far far away, that is your quest in this game, and that will lead to a lot of danger and big adventures.\n\nWhen I went out on the adventures as the two sons I first noticed how beautiful the graphic is, it's like running through paintings or fairytales and it reminds me a lot about Trine in that way, though with its on touch of course!  I also realised how big the world really felt like while playing even if it's a quite liniar game. Outside of the liniarity there is a lot you can choose to explore which can give various achievements that won't be achieved by doing the main story. The good thing about this is that it wont interrupt you on your quest. Speaking of the quest you will be doing alot of puzzle and who says no to a little challenge while playing, am I right? I know that people say it's a bad thing for this game being so short, but I must say I didn't really feel that way while playing, actually I got so absorbed in to the game that the time it took to finish it didn't really matter to me.

While nothing is in English (or any language known to man for that matter), the emotions and actions of each character conveys what they're saying perfectly, not at any point was I confused as too what was going on. I can't recommend this game enough and while I got it at a bargain during the sale for only £1.09, this game is worth so much more. Starbreeze Studios, you have my blessing to create further masterpieces as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is simply wonderful.","January 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Rightfully more of an 'interactive story' than it is a true game. It's short, about three hours long, and you'll want to set aside the time to play it all in one sitting. The controls are intuitive, and the puzzles and obstacles are simple, but the world is vibrant and colorful, and there are a varied amount of environments to go through. Though you probably won't get more than one playthrough out of it (two if you want to do the achievements, which are all small side things that don't affect the story, and are simply for personal satisfaction, but they are satisfying to do), that one playthrough will be excellent. Turn off steam messages, dim the light, and lose yoursel fin the world for a few hours.

The mouse is not needed.\n\nNow, the game is pretty solid, it's about 3 hours and 25 minutes long with a few deaths, and the price point of 14 euros can make it an odd choice for some. Not to fret, the game brings beautiful environments, intriguing places, and smart puzzles which aren't extremely hard to solve after you get used on how the two brothers work. (Now that the game has a bit of age behind it, you can find it heavily discounted in sales!)\n\nAnd the story, I can't say anything without spoiling it, and honestly, it's best to go with an empty mind. The story will hit you like a bag of bricks, and when you think it stopped, it will whack you again over the head just to be sure it hit you enough.\n\nPlay it, I doubt people regretted playing it.","January 1, 2014","true","3.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/225080/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","A quest of the two eponymous characters to find a magical cure for their ill father, where you get to control both of them at the same time in a sort of puzzle-lite third persons' view co-operating-with-yourself adventure game.\n\nIt's essentially a very visceral, very interactive fairy tale. The control scheme, the environmental puzzles with quite obvious solutions to push the story forward.. It is all about creating practically a physical bond between you and the brothers, via the controller, to feel their struggle quite personally.\n\nThe tale takes you to strange places along the way. That also includes variety of emotional places, there are times to be happy, and to be sad, and perhaps to be scared, too. And it can get very intense at all of them. Yes, this is definitely about the journey not the destination. Even the achievements accentuate exploration and doing side activities not on the main storyline - this is exactly what you get rewarded for. You get exactly zero achievements for the main "quest" (which probably also serves to well, avoid spoilers).\n\nAll this means you are doing everybody a great disservice if you're just watching some let's play or something. I think any single player game with a story is meant to be a GAME, therefore something for you to experience personally not via watching others do it (unless you've done it already and want to relive via someone elses eyes), but this is especially true in this title.\n\nIt's best experienced in one go, to keep you in the emotional flow, it's at most 4 hours long if you like to smell flowers along the way (you can even literally do just that at places.. well not YOU-you but you know what I mean, the characters you play as) and you probably wouldn't want to leave a movie in the middle and come back later, would you?\n\nAlso, it's obviously designed with a twin stick controller in mind, controlling each brother with one of the sticks and triggers. For example things like cranking a winch are just felt more personally if you're actually "cranking" your sticks. But - it does have keyboard bindings, WSAD for one brother and arrow keys for the other, so it actually is playable without a controller despite the warning on the Steam page, you're just somewhat missing out and I imagine keyboard control can be rather frustrating, I mean even the twin sticks almost cross that line often but luckily the game isn't hard so that's never an issue.\n\nSeriously if you're a PC gamer and do not have a controller yet, then you were asking Santa Klaus or your regional equivalent for wrong things. Because you are missing out in titles that were designed primarily with controllers in mind, and this game is perhaps the best example yet of just how much you're missing (otherwise the design with controller in mind usually just comes from a mild form of consolitis). But mind you, you don't need anything posh and expensive, you're probably somewhat worse by not having things like force feedback but otherwise there are pretty cheap controllers that do the job just as well, you may just need something like x360cemu if it's not an xinput controller.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend playing this game. I mean I'm personally not entirely sure why TotalBiscuit hails it as perhaps the best game of all time as far as he is concerned, it must have had much higher impact on him, but nonetheless it is truly a great gem, exemplifying of just how well controls can be integrated into a game, and how a game  can present you various emotional states not just cashing on one.","December 31, 2013","true","5.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

Very good.\n\nIs it worth my time and money?\nYes. While the game is relatively short (can be completed in 4 hours during a normal playthru), the game sells a sense of "woah" to the player in large doses. Definitely worth the money. Alternatively, buy it when it goes on sale (like I did).\n\nIs this game for anyone?\nYes, anyone can pick this up and play with ease. While the character controls are quite unique, they're pretty straightforward to learn and use. The puzzles aren't really hard, but because of the way they are executed, they bring a feeling of satisfaction.\n\nLinear, open-world or something else?\nGame's very linear. Not many branching paths, aside from a few puzzle sections involving slight backtracking.\n\nGameplay mechanics, gimmicks?\nYou use both analog sticks to move both of the brothers at the same time (left one controls one, right one controls the other). Can be confusing at first, especially when they'll be on the opposite screen-space from which side their analog stick is.\n\nGraphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?\nVery pretty to look at. The world is stylized to look like something between a fairy-tale fantasy land mixed with real medieval times. It all feels very well crafted and each section of the world smoothly transitions to the next.\n\nAudio design and soundtrack?\nSound effects and ambiency is done well. A small settlement sounds like a small settlement, while a deserted castle sounds like a deserted castle. Music only plays in key points of the game, such as cutscenes, exposition, etc. but also sounds amazingly well done. A definite addition to the game's tone and atmosphere.\n\nPlot, story?\nPretty basic, clearly inspired by fairy tales but with a few nice, yet predictable twists. Still, very enjoyable story that feels very well set into the created world.\n\nHow does the game run?\nI played and completed the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, vNidia GeForce 9600GT 1GB) and it ran at a pretty stable 40-45fps on 1920x1080 resolution with V-Sync turned off. Expect better results if your PC is newer than mine.\n\nAny details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?\nYes. The flying owl gryphon thing.\n\nAnything you didn't like?\nYes. Options menu in the launcher is a joke. Definitely needs more graphical settings, especially since this is a Unreal Engine 3 game. Also, game does not support most cheap USB joypads (since the PC version apparently uses XInput signals instead of DirectInput signals). You either use keyboard, a 360 controller or download x360ce (the XBOX360 controller emulator) and configure your joypad through that. Extra hassle that could be easily avoided with a bit more work.\n\nFinal score?\nI give Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons a flying owl gryphon thing out of 5.","January 9, 2014","true","3.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Panzeros/recommended/225080/","Panzeros","Panzeros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Panzeros/","141 products in account","Let me start off by saying, don't expect much from this game. I feel like it is a game that could be victim to overhype.\nI went in merely with the intention of clearing some dreaded Steam backlog and hadn't seen anything about the game in over a year, forgetting how nice the screenshots looked.\nTherefore, going in with no expectations whatsoever, I came away having played one of, if not my favourite, game of all time.\n\nThis game gets better and better as it goes on, so don't expect to be blown away from the start. It is the grand sense that I really had been on an adventure that was left with me at the end, and being 3-4 hours long it feels like I had taken part in an interactive movie (having played it in one sitting).\n\nBut it is definitely a game, and the gameplay was just the right amount of fun. A lot of clever design choices means the game continually flows, adding to that sense of adventure. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult, but never did I feel like I was having my intelligence insulted either.  There were times when I anticpated having to do something again, or something similar to what I had just done and had a feeling of tedium, only to be pleasantly surprised that the developers recognised that, and changed it up completely.  I wish more developers would recognise that a game doesn't have to be long and filled with fluff to make it good. Three hours of quality is plenty for someone with limited time to play games.\n\nThe story isn't complex but it will leave an impression on most people. And how they go about conveying that story was also a clever touch. The game has no understandable dialogue, using only an invented language with no subtitles to get it's message across and I'm surprised at how well it does this when, in my opinion, the character models are the worst part of the game. They look out of place against the fantastic backdrops that make you stop and sit on a bench to look at the vistas, even when you were planning on rushing through a game to get it off your checklist. So at first, I wasn't struck. However, despite this, the sense of emotion you get from the characters is really rather deep and by the end you're completely invested. Most of the game is spent in third person and you won't be up close enough to see the poor character details anyway.\n\nThe other thing most people will comment on are the controls. You control both brothers, from different sides of the keyboard and I can see why a lot of people will mark them down negatively. It is often difficult to get them both running in merely a straight line. I argue though that the controls are perfect for the type of game it is and add a layer of complexity to it that stops the game feeling too easy. Like I said, the puzzles aren't difficult at all, but the controls make you have to think about what you're doing, and I have to say, the times when you simultaneously have both brothers doing something complex, or even just running down a path and crossing over each other and turning at slightly different times, but doing so accurately, feels really good.\n\nThere are a few negative points to the game, a couple of which rear their head almost straight away. As mentioned, the character details aren't great. Then, you come to the first puzzle.  You have to raise a platform, and it's immensely tedious, especially if you let go, and you have to start again. This platform raising happens once more in the game, and if  anything is even more tedious. Maybe I did it wrong. But it's over in a couple of minutes and overall doesn't affect the game. Lastly, texture glitches. In two cutscenes, some textures didn't load. It was only a rug and a chest of drawers, so not game breaking, but noticable. Also in one part, a shadow didn't load that was part of the mechanics of the situation, and I died. I didn't realise why until I started again and saw the shadow now loaded.\n\nOverall, I can't believe I had this game sitting in my library for so long being unappreciated. I also feel bad for spending so little on it. I can't quite remember what I paid, but it probably wasn't enough.\n\nPlay this game, don't expect much and you're sure to have a good time.","February 8, 2015","true","3.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

And if you can, play with a controller over a keyboard. (CAN be played with a keyboard despite the way it's been advertised)\n\nA beautiful game that's focused mostly on the story and creative ways to play rather than a challenging gameplay.\nThis game can be emotional, funny, mysterious and epic. The whole game can be completed in a single sitting, yes it's short. But that doesn't make the game any less impressive. The story itself revolves around 2 brothers and the way they've implemented the controller to interact with them is simply brilliant. Hence it's highly recommended to be played with a controller over a keyboard. The game has a deep message behind it, about life, morality and overcoming struggles. And the music, I fell in love with it instantly as soon as I heard it. It's absolutely perfect. It knows when it needs to be serious, epic and just downright silly. The art style the devs went for is great as well. Some scenes are completely breathtaking, combined with the beautiful music scores.\n\nNot a lot of games could pull off what this game manages to do. Needless to say, this game has become one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nWhen it comes to cons, I don't really have any with this game other than a couple of bug encounters that didn't really pull me out of the game.","April 6","true","0.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

It wasn't until a friend of mine posted on my Steam profile telling me to give it a go did I seriously download it on my laptop and made a genuine effort to put some time into it.\nThe first thing that you'll notice about this game is that there's no real spoken dialogue. I mean the characters do make sounds and seem to have some verbal exchanges but it's more like Simlish. If The Sims has taught us anything in the last 20ish years though is that you don't need to understand the language to understand a story. This is actually the biggest lesson I'm reminded of as I live somewhere where I don't understand what 90% of the people around me are saying on a daily basis, but I digress.\n\nBrothers features a beautiful rustic fantasy atmospheric adventure almost as if it was straight out of a fairy tale. You and your brother go on a journey across the land to find a tree that could save your dying father's life. Despite it being primarily about our two main characters and their journey you get to meet a lot of different inhabitants that help you along the way. Also you see the relationship and personalities between the younger and older brother in how they interact with each other and those they meet.\n\nYou'll find both have skills that move the game along. As we all know the older brother excels in strength you find out early on that the little brother also has some advantages due to his size and pulls just as much as weight as his counterpart.\n\nSomewhere along the way though you'll find out that despite the cheery magical surroundings that the fairy tale aspect might be more ancient fairy tales where things don't always work out the way you expect it would and not the Disney type where people live happily ever after. That however, makes this game all the more compelling as at some point I was playing through tears. This isn't too much a spoiler but I think when a game can elicit emotional responses without saying a word that speaks volumes of the story and characters.\n\nI was sad when my adventure finally came to an end but I felt satisfied and a real sense of growth in the characters without any leveling up system or super powers. Overall you have great graphics, a touching story with endearing characters. It was a pleasure to play, even with the sometimes unfamiliar controller mechanics where you're using each side to move both brothers simultaneously. I wholeheartedly recommend this game as one everyone should experience.","April 1, 2015","true","4.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I loved the crap out of this game, and while it is short (it took me about 3 hours to beat the game), I think this is one of my favourite games ever. At least in my top four. 9.8/10 (really crazy good for me).\n\nThe basic plot: two brothers have to go to a far away land to get a cure for a rare illness their father has. The story adds onto this and has several twists and turns but this is the basis of it.\n\nWhats interesting about this game is that there is no actual interpretable dialog. what i mean by that is they make sounds, but its gibberish, and you have to look for context clues and hear the emotion in their voices to understand whats going on.\n\nThis game is basically a puzzle game with two buttons, analog stick for movement and action buttons to act upon the world (im pretty sure you can only play this game with a controller). the controls are smoothe and the difficulty is good, i failed a few times but no part was frusterating. The graphics are amazing  and the art and world they create will stick with me for months (seriously breathtaking).. If you love art, BUY THIS GAME. if you have emotions, BUY THIS GAME!!!!! basically the only reason i wouldn't say to buy this game is if you just are not that sympathetic. because this game relies on the fact that you WANT the dad to be cured and want these kids to succeed, if you dont give a rats ♥♥♥ about the dad or the kids you wont be motivated to play the game and probably wont have that much fun.\n\nLike i said before, probably one of my favourite games ever, I would recommend this game to basically anyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/225080/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a third-person linear co-op game and inspired by games such as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus due to their similarities in gameplay and aesthetics.\n\nThe premise of the game is following two brothers, Naie (eldest) and Naiee (youngest), through their journey across different lands searching for a magical tree which has the cure that can save their dying father. Being a very narratively driven game, revealing any details about the story would ruin much of the game’s charm since that is its main driving force.\n\nThe game plays exactly like a co-op puzzle-platformer where you control the two brothers through their journey. Throughout the game, using a controller is strongly recommended as playing it on keyboard, whilst still doable, can result in some awkward coordination between the two controllable protagonists when they start bumping into each other or objects like two drunks. The actual gameplay itself is satisfying due to the nice blend of “puzzles” requiring both brothers’ participation throughout most of the game. The difficulty of these “puzzles” may eventually feel disappointing after a while as they do not provide any concrete challenge to the player(s) (hence the inverted commas), although that might have been deliberate for the integrity of the game’s pace. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is, indeed, one of those games where the difficulty requires being at a minimum for the narrative to be at full throttle. Remember, no one wants to get constantly stuck solving complex puzzles in a narratively-driven game as it subsequently ruins the game’s pace.\n\nHowever, where it lacks in challenging puzzles or even perhaps rewarding gameplay, it compensates for its narrative which in actual fact is the heart of this game. The journey, albeit disappointedly short, transports you in a world where you believe you are in a place like Middle-Earth; travelling through various mesmerising landscapes on your quest for the cure while the suiting soundtrack plays in the background. All of its narrative is achieved rather through visuals and gestures as there is not any comprehendible dialogue in the entire game. That in itself is commendable as not many games can pull it off as successfully as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons does. Frankly, each gesture or visual representation is easily and surprisingly understandable. Besides all that, the game also offers in its storytelling a handful of moments of happiness, laughter, seriousness and sadness without feeling schizophrenic with its mood shifts. The game‘s narrative can have some amazing set-pieces, but also a couple of clumsy ones.\n\nAnd that is as much as Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons can offer to players. On top of its colourful charm, or even some of its darker undertones, there are two main complains I personally had with this game in my first playthrough which ultimately felt detrimental to an extent towards my overall enjoyment. On a technical level, I encountered three game-breaking bugs which would not allow me to continue to the next area. Whilst two of them were solved by looking up online forums, the latter required restarting two prior chapters since simply restarting the current one was not sufficient to solve the problem. As of now, I still have no idea how those bugs triggered when it seems that the majority of people never even encountered them in the first place. Still, having to restart two complete chapters is bothersome. Then lastly, the ending. I will honestly be one of those in the minority who was not totally satisfied with the story’s conclusion nor did it have an impact on me. Even as I wish to critically evaluate it in this review, I cannot do that without simply spoiling it. But I will say this: I understood what they tried to achieve with the coming of age approach, but reflecting back through the entire journey, the writing at this point was sloppy and felt more of a cop out in the end to me. It also made me realise how Naie was not fleshed out as a character as much as his younger brother, Naiee, making a certain event not as effective as the developers would have hoped for, to me at least. Perhaps that is because the story might have been moving a bit too fast for things to fully develop.\n\nConclusively, Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is one those video games where you delve in exclusively for the storytelling experience. Nothing more, nothing less.  Without even sounding remotely pretentious, It is hardly the “masterpiece” everyone clams it to be, although it will definitely, and respectfully, leave a lasting impression for many people regardless, especially for youngsters. But not for everyone. Mechanically, it has a solid co-op experience with extremely easy puzzles to solve and backed up by artistically appealing sceneries, a fitting soundtrack and a simple, yet immersive, narrative despite a few clumsy set-pieces and a somewhat unsatisfying ending. At full price, however, I would definitely not recommend this due to its short length (2-3 hours at most) and limited replayability as there is not much reason to revisit it anytime soon now that you know how the story wraps up. Conversely, considering it always goes as low as £1 during virtually any Steam sales, there is absolutely no excuse not to try this, and that is why I am recommending it in the end. Despite some of its flaws, I truly had fun playing it and thought it managed to do what it was aiming for mostly pretty well, even if I will probably not reflect too much upon it in the near future.","December 22, 2015","true","5.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The puzzles aren't very hard, you'll probably never get stuck for more than a couple of minutes, but the game never gets boring. Story and character design are just wonderful... and considering no one ever speaks (at least not in a real language) I guess we're really really near to perfection in this department.

Can be played without controller but dont do it, use a 2 stick controller. Hits right in the feelings in the best possible way. No one will be left unmoved by the game.\n\nLong review (SPOILER FREE):\nGame is set in a fantasy world in which you play as two brothers on a epic quest to acquire a certain item. It is a very mature tale about growing up, brotherly bonds, effects of  trauma on a young person, overcoming those traumas and acceptance of death as part of life.\n\nArt direction is really good and make the world seem very alive which in turn makes you get really immersed in the game. Game is not long around 2,5h (4h if you stop to take in scenery) but in that short time it will take you on a emotional roller coaster ranging from heartwarming to heartbreaking. You will not feel like you were cheated by how short it is in the end, it will feel perfectly timed.\n\nI can honestly say this is one of the few games that ever induced such deep emotions and cathartic feeling at the end. I am talking about The Walking Dead Clementine affection or MGS Sniper Wolf death scene level of emotions. This game will stick with me for the rest of my life. Please play this game in ONE sitting.\n\nCharacters in this game speak in a made up language and there are no subtitles yet design is so masterful you will never not understand what is happening or get lost or not understand a puzzle. In fact i was impressed that i developed such strong feelings for the brothers despite it. Puzzles range from easy to medium. Sometimes they are a bit "hard" just because you are most likely not used to controlling 2 characters at once using both analog sticks and R2 L2 triggers. Personally i did not find them clunky it worked really well for such a design.\n\nMost impressive thing that really hit me in the feels was how the game  managed to incorporate emotions into actuall controls. That blew my mind and if you play until the end you will know what i mean by that.\n\nOnly criticism i can possibly give would be that you should have a controller. Everything else is perfect at least for me. I will follow future similar releases from this studio. This game is a work of interactive art that can not be done in any other medium except video gaming.\n\nGO BUY IT !!!\n\n","October 19, 2014","true","4.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Although there are still some things that could be better and need work, the things they did right really stand out and exemplify the game in a great way. First lets talk about the bad things.\n\nThis game has its bugs and glitches that actually break the game. I was unfortunate enough to encounter one of these that would not allow a cutscene to play causing me to be stuck with no way to progress. 505 support gave me a few solutions that did nothing to help until a friend of mine found a video displaying the same problem I had. (http://youtu.be/c-DJGQ3t3YE if u wanna see it) I was unable to play for weeks emailing 505 asking for help. That was the only game breaking bug i encountered, but there were many graphical glitches and frame lag spikes at the most random of places.\n\nOne thing I truly enjoyed about his game is that it does not hold your hand. New little mechanics are added into the puzzles and will require you to think a little which is refreshing from 99% of games where everything is handed to you instantly. Another they did correctly was the controls. They were extremely innovative and well made, easy to use and although i would get my thumbs tangled, it felt smooth and overall nice. The story is a cliche, but thru the gameplay and interactions, it really was quite good. The game never truly dragged out when compared to most games and the visuals were nice. They could have done much more with the art, but how it is now is still well done.\n\nOverall, this is a solid game with great controls, a moving story, fun puzzles and nice visuals. It does have its bugs and glitches but with some research you should be able to find a fix and continue on your journey.

The journey you take with the brothers is extraordinary. Closest thing I can liken it to is Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls, except if those had been made by Astrid Lindgren.\n\nA couple scenes had janky animation, and at one time I felt frustration at not knowing what to do, but those issues don't matter on the whole. The world design and story more than make up for it. Critics like Adam Sessler & TotalBiscuit had hyped up the ending quite a bit, and probably as a result I didn't find it outstanding in any way. It ended like it should, but it wasn't the high point for me. The best scenes in the game were the ones which were completely optional. For example at one point you meet a man who has lost his family in a fire and is about to kill himself. Whether you help him or not is optional, and if you do there's a thing you can do for him which helps him deal with his loss. This entire area is off to the side and can easily be ignored if you choose to. But this, and many other areas like it provided the strongest moments in the game for me.\n\nI'm glad I played it.

It's a rejection of every condescending trend in game design from the past 5 years. No hand-holding, no collectables, no constant pats on the back. This is a game that treats its players like adults. Your *special reward* for playing Brothers is the WONDROUS JOY of playing Brothers.\n\n2. The developers knew their constraints and made smart decisions with the resources they had. No budget for voice actors? That's fine, the characters will speak their own language. XBLA games have limited graphics? Screw it, we'll pick an art style that looks good at any poly count.\n\n3. Did I say "looks good"? Sorry, I meant GORGEOUS. Brothers is flat out beautiful. You'll find yourself constantly stopping to take in jaw-dropping vistas. The game knows it too. The designers sprinkled benches throughout whose only purpose are to let your characters relax and admire the view.\n\n4. No English, no problem. You don't need to understand the characters' words to get what they're saying. Everything you need to know comes across in tone, body language, and action. Brothers is the ultimate rejection of the David Cage school of videogame emotion. You don't need to see the individual atoms of NaCl and H2O in a character's tears to inspire empathy.\n\n5. I adored the coming-of-age theme. It's done in a way that's entirely unique to the medium, and yet I've never seen another game pull it off the way Brothers does. The game begins in innocence. You're running across verdant hills and through lush fields, playing pranks on local farmers, dodging mean dogs.\n\nBut the darkness slowly creeps in. First, it's only in the background, and easily ignored by our storybook children on their magical adventure. Soon, though, you'll be neck-deep in the muck, and the green grass will be nothing but a distant memory.\n\nFor such a short game (3-4 hours), it's incredible to compare where you begin and where you end up. It's the journey in between, the way that the protagonists react in the face of an increasingly adult world, and how they ultimately  learn to live in it—that's what makes Brothers so special.","February 1, 2014","true","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyKrimZen/recommended/225080/","LadyKrimZen","Lady KrimZen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyKrimZen/","198 products in account","Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons was developed by the company Starbreeze Studios, who were responsible for games like The Chronicles of Riddick games, The Darkness and Payday 2 and directed by famous Swedish film director Josef Fares.\n\nThe two Brothers, Naiee (the younger brother) and Naia (the older brother) become united as one not only by the plot but with the help of the game’s mechanics and narration. Thrust out their village and into a gorgeous and almost realistic storybook, the Brother’s only weapons are their minds and their only resource is each other.\n\nThe brothers then embark on their epic journey through the beautiful landscape of villages, hills, mountains, caves and even the valley of dead giants and trolls that went to war with each other on a very bloody battlefield. At the same time the Brothers also faced challenges like the local bully, a farmer's aggressive dog, and deadly wolves.  Along with these challenges the Brothers also undertake a journey of self-discovery as they learn to work together to overcome each challenge. They even learn and work out how to help out the various characters they meet during their adventure - like reuniting a friendly pair of trolls, saving a man attempting suicide, aiding an inventor, freeing a badly injured griffin that help them before succumbing to its injures and even a girl from being scarified by a blood cult.\n\nThe dialogue throughout the game is in an artificial language and there are no signs to really provide any type of information to the player in regards to where you must go. You just follow the path, trusting that the brothers are heading the right way. And this parallels the relationship between the brothers: although you can’t understand what they say to one another, you know they love and look out for one another.\n\nThe game’s visuals are gorgeous to look at and the game rarely lets a few minutes pass without offering some sort of staggeringly gorgeous landscape to ogle. There are even benches scattered throughout the game for the Brothers to sit on. The player is given permission to stop and enjoy the vistas; which are not only beautiful but ram home how vast a world Naia and Naiee have to traverse and, by extension, how vital their relationship is to their own survival. The game makes it so clear that the characters themselves are impressed by what they see. The soundtrack was equally as gorgeous. The Swedish vocals added that extra charm when it came to cut scenes and often provided the atmosphere and told the player what they should feel at that precise moment.\n\nThe player controls both brothers simultaneously, each mapped to an analogue stick, as that makes button mashing impossible when it comes to puzzle solving. Every action from "grab the ledge above" to "play the harp" is performed with the triggers. When I first played this game I did find it quite hard to control both the brothers the same time. Usually one would end up running into a wall. Ultimately the control scheme acts as a defining piece of storytelling. The control scheme is actually very simple, though. You control both brothers independently; the older brother’s actions are enacted with the left analogue stick and the younger brother with the right analogue stick. Each brother also has one interactive button that is context sensitive to the area or person it is being used on. There is a very brief introduction to the controls, which becomes a very strong narrative choice because it allows the player to naturally grow with the brothers on their journey and experiment a little more, revealing layers of their characters. Coming back to the point I mentioned about the Brother’s communication is almost psychic, we eventually learn that due to the control scheme of this game that the brothers are sharing a brain; which is in fact the player’s brain. But a curious thing happens as you help the siblings solve puzzles and work in concert to skirt danger. You learn. You get better at controlling these two disparate entities and, in turn, they appear to work together more seamlessly.\n\n(WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT)\n\nSo after the brothers save the girl from the blood cult’s ritual they decide to ally with her. They reach a point in their journey where the girl urges the Brothers to enter a cave which they presume is the direction that they must head in order to reach the Tree of Life.\n\nBefore Naia enters the claustrophobic tunnel, Naiee become hesitant, pulling Naia’s hand and tries to convince him that this is not a good idea, foreboding that something bad is about to happen. Naia insists that nothing is going to happen and since Naiee is too weak to go on by himself he follows both Naia and the girl into the tunnel. As the brothers shuffle forward, you start to notice what appear to be victims mummified in web. Something doesn’t seem right.\n\nIn an instant, the girl exposes her true, evil arachnid form and imprisons the brothers in a web and slowly pulls them upwards to feast on.  As Naiee awakes, the brothers devise a plan to escape. To defeat this she-spider Naiee must ram into her while Naia tears off each of her limbs. The fight is pretty easy and feels quite satisfying. As Naia rips off the last leg he is pierced by the spider’s venomous pincher and loses colour of his skin simultaneously. Now Naiee must carry Naia for the remaining way to the Tree of Life, where Naiee must now collect the Water of Life to save not only their father, but Naia’s life too.\n\nAs you’re controlling Naiee throughout the Tree of Life using only the right side of your controller, you start to feel alone and awkward. Normally the right analogue stick is used to look around in a game; not to move about. It’s weird, unnatural and disjointed. The control scheme is now missing something and you as the player are not use to using the right side of the controller to move around. What you are feeling is exactly how Naiee is feeling in the story but for different metaphorical reasons. The use of only the right side of the controller is symbolic for the emptiness inside of Naiee. And to top it all off, even after Naiee retrieves the Water of Life you find out it’s too late to save Naia and ends up dying in Naiee arms in the most heart wrecking scene I have ever witness. And it doesn’t end there!\n\nThe emotional knife digs in as you control Naiee, again only with the right side of your controller, to bury Naia, a character that even you as the player, have become emotional attached to. And despite never understanding the dialogue in this game you cannot help but empathise with Naiee.  And even after that, Naiee rushes home to deliver the Water of Life to his father. However Naiee must cross the shoreline before doing so. He is faced with his greatest fear! The flashback to his mother’s death at the beginning of the game explains this phobia, and without Naia there to carry him across like he has been throughout the entire game. Using the right trigger only makes Naiee steps back from the water. But as you realise that the ghost of Naia is with Naiee you also realise that he is also in your controller; and by pressing the left trigger Naiee gathers the strength and determination to swim across the shore, climb up the mountain, use the machinery to reach his father. Even though Naia was not physically there to help Naiee or for you to control with the left analogue stick, it didn’t matter at all. He was still there to use in the left trigger button; which then become symbolic for the brother’s true strength. As for what happens after Naiee reaches his father, I’m not going to say. All I will say is it’s better to experience the ending on your own.","July 17, 2014","true","8.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

There are no side-quests, nor is there any real purpose in honing one's skills, at least not beyond learning how to control the two characters simultaneously.  However, if you enjoy contemplative nature hikes, appreciate minutiae, and are even remotely of an empathic disposition, this one is definitely worth your time.  There are moments that will stay with you well past the meager 3-hour duration.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game ran with barely a hiccup on my 8-year-old laptop, so just about anything with at least an integrated graphics chipset should have no trouble.  While a controller is not strictly necessary, it is important to note that the keyboard configuration cannot be changed (wasd+space and arrow keys+right control); since you will be controlling both characters at once, this requires a keyboard that supports many concurrent key presses.  Though it is playable, the recommendation of having a controller is a good one.","July 1, 2014","true","7.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Let's point out some things first:\n\nThe music and the graphics are simply amazing, you can't argue about that. The controlling of the two brothers was new to me, so it took time to get used to it, but it's not hard at all. There are no speaking in the game, just gesturing and some mumbling. Because of this, i just simply cannot form a connection with the brothers. Okay, i'm controlling them, but i just couldn't care about them much enough. And it really affects the game, i think.\n\nSome SPOILERS INCOMING!\n\nI loved the dead giants valley, it was gore, it was epic, and yet still beautiful in some way. I was totally amazed by the map design there.\n\nBut there's one thing, that almost made me quit immediately, and give this game a negative review:\nThat girl at the end, turning into spider. Was that really necessary? I don't have a problem with spiders, nor do i fear them, but it just wasn't filling in that word, or even in the game. I was shocked, and not in a good way.

Storyline is just brilliant. Even the game is short, you get to experience so much in this adventure on every step, and it gets more and more emotional toward the end. Not many games in history achieved such level of involvement.\n\nThe only bad thing is that its gameplay extremely easy to the degree it is often boring or just inexistent. It is ridiculously linear, you have just one narrow route (or a couple parallel ones) and you can't leave it or fall of a cliff, even characters jump over a pit on your way automatically when you approach it. Despite quite innovative control mechanics and occasional interesting puzzles, you still don't get anything challenging to solve with reasonable amount of effort, everything is pretty much obvious right away. All that almost excludes failure state of the game in practice, even my first death was way past the middle of playthrough.\n\nTo sum it up - it is a great experience you should not miss if you like games like that, or just want to experience what the game offers.

All the story-telling is done by the character's body languages or the game simply showing that something is happening in the area. It has a gorgeous art style and some beautifully designed levels, both visually and how you progress through them. They're very linear though, with only some minor exploration leading to a nice view or something to do for an achievement. Your goal in this game is to find some magical tree and bring back some water of the healing well inside of it, in order to cure your ill father.\n\nThe gameplay is quite innovative, putting the player in control of both characters at once, using only one controller. The left thumb stick and trigger control one character's movement and actions, and the right stick and trigger are used for the other character. Keyboard support has been added some time ago as well, but I can't vouch for how well that works as I only played it with a controller. It's pretty tricky to get used to at first, and I often had to move one character at a time or pause shortly before releasing a character's action button to make sure I wouldn't accidentally let the other character fall to his death.\n\nMost puzzles and obstacles require the brothers to work together and make up for each other's weaknesses. The big brother is the strongest one so he will be pulling heavy switches and carrying things, as well as boosting his little brother to higher platforms. The little brother never learned to swim due to being traumatized by seeing his mother drown in front of his eyes, so he clings onto his bigger brother when they need to swim through a river or pond. But because he is more nimble he manages to get to some places where the big brother can't get to and then helps him get past. A lot of the time you will also need to use both brothers at once to move something heavy or interact with two things that are spread apart at once.\n\nThe ending is very emotional, but obviously I can't talk about that because it would spoil the entire experience for anyone who hasn't played this yet. And if you haven't, I really recommend you do. It goes really cheap during sales, and it only takes about three hours to complete. Despite being so very short, it still delivers a great experience that's really worth your time, especially if you're open to the more artsy and touching games out there. It would be cool to play this game with someone else online, but then that would also take away the innovative controls which are part of what makes this game such a great experience.","November 30, 2014","true","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Twice.\n\nWhich is a good thing - I like it when fictional stuff elicits tears from my eyes; I call it ‘resonating with art’. (What? It’s better than that ‘ninjas cutting onions’ cliche people always use... right?)\n\nOn the subject of cliches, this game has many: a convenient sunset, a generic premise to set up a generic conflict, a flashback recalling happier times, and at some point a backstabber.\n\nThe game is also linear, and short (3 hours). But hey, sometimes it’s fun to play a linear and short game. (People complain about linearity, but if every game had an open world, well, we’d have a dump truck-full of terrible open-world games.)\n\nThe difference with this game is that its linearity serves a purpose: there’s a constant build-up, and just the faintest sense of a ticking clock, of inevitability.\n\nEven the cliches add rather than detract; they make the story seem innocent, the adventure seem mild, the characters seem... invincible. They keep things straight-forward, because straight and forward is precisely where the game wants you to go. Even the controls, which will take time to adjust to, are as basic as they get.\n\nBut for all its simplicity, Brothers doesn’t let you grow bored. There’s never two of the same puzzle, and the settings change regularly. (I have a short attention span, but this game never once lost its magic.) You might ‘die’ a few times, but you’re never really stuck, and even in the few places where a sense of urgency might be felt, there’s never much tension. It’s the kind of game that you can play at leisure, while also being very fun.\n\nThe setting, mind you, will at some point take an abrupt turn - in literal terms, you’ll start to go downhill instead of up - and from there the mood will start to shift. Just wait.\n\nEverything, from the settings to the cliches, will there reveal itself as a tool, a gameplay feature employed by the developer to serve a purpose - but it’s a purpose I shan’t spoil. Even the controller, which you’d spent a decent time mastering, will turn out to have, all along, been a pawn expertly positioned in storytelling.\n\nTowards the end every piece will culminate like a well-choreographed dance, a superbly-structured film. And in many ways this game is a film, but it’s the kind of film that the developer goes to lengths to make sure you’re a part of. Enjoy it.\n\nBecause you may not want to play this game twice. You’ll certainly want others to play it, to experience it with child-like eyes; but you’ll also wish that you could return to when your own eyes were child-like - when, you might say, times were happier. Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is just one of those games that you can never un-play.\n\n10/10\n\nP.S. I purchased this game on sale (80% off, I think). Whether you think it's worth the full price will depend on if, for the same price, you'd purchase a 3-hour film that you knew would be great to watch.","February 18","true","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I installed and played Brothers in one sitting, unable to stop myself from progressing through the game.\n\nI felt such intrigue and splendor as I navigated the beautiful levels and explored some of the secrets and easter eggs hidden in each world. The main characters themselves, Nyaa and Naiee are loveable but disticntly different. The older Naiee is mature and respectful whilst the juvenile Naiee is cheeky but adoreably curious all the same. And despite the fact that all the dialogue in the game is in tongue, the body language and emotions portrayed by the characters alone is more than enough to understand.\n\nMy only qualm with this game is that it felt that it cut short too quickly.. And the hope I had towards the end of the narative didn't come true, yet I can accept it. I just wish I wasn't feeling so.. robbed of my happiness.. Regardless of this though, the loss any player might feel as the tale of two sons concludes, the grief felt is shouldered by the in game characters and it's hard to not feel like you the player aren't there with them mourning.\n\nWhat ever the case, the journey and excitement of Brothers makes it truly a game experience I won't forget, and one I hope everyone can share and be a part of. I've been moved to the point where I already purchased a second copy for a friend's wishlist. Have fun playing "Brothers"!","December 30, 2013","true","17.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game is compact; so there's little you can draw reference to without spoiling anything, and to ruin this beautiful little tale would do the reader a great disservice. That in itself should serve as a recommendation, though it comes with several caveats.\n\nFirstly, there is only one reason why you would logically ever play Brothers twice, and that's to get achievements. As sad a statement as that is in many games, here it's in the games' favour, as the achievements here take the form of vignettes which occur off Brother's beaten (and entirely linear) path. These brief scenes take a variety of tones and forms, and some are more enjoyable than others (of course). The merit of this approach is that the achievements enhance the game rather than detract from it, and for this Brothers should be applauded. Find all of these asides from the main tale though, and that's it - nothing more to see here.\n\nSo, the game itself. Brothers is an isometric overhead adventure, in which you guide the titular big and little brothers (who call one another Naia and Naiee in the game world's language, whatever those words may mean) around various obstacles on their journey to find a cure for their ailing father. As we have come to expect, the game and soundtrack are both beautiful, with a visually realised and aurally rounded world waiting to be explored. The manner of exploration is probably the most talked about and easily discussed mechanic of the game, which to summarily recap, involves simultaneous control of both brothers. On a standard gamepad set-up, the left stick controls the big brother, right stick the little brother, with left and right triggers serving as each character's action/interaction button, and left/right bumper rotating the camera. This control scheme may be both the game's key draw and most off-putting mechanic depend on how you personally handle the remapping of ingrained controller use - the operation is fairly fluid and has a gentle enough curve to allow you to get used to it, and I personally found the system engaging and enjoyable, but I can see the same aspects frustrating and annoying many gamers.\n\nNonetheless, overcome the fact that you WILL at times be constantly running one brother into a wall while the other calls out to his counterpart for no reason, simply because the little brother is positioned to the left of the big brother and your mind has once again mapped the left stick to the left character and vice-versa, and you have a wonderful ride ahead of you.\n\nAnd you will need a controller. Yes, the game has keyboard controls. Be aware however that the game itself will warn you that it is designed, specifically, to be controlled with a pad. On a keyboard certain tasks requiring rotation of both thumbsticks simultaneously... do not map well. I can't honestly recommend the game to anyone without a controller.\n\nAs to the story, events and specifics of the world - they should all be experienced for oneself. So long as you have some sort of empathy within you, this is a great little journey which will draw you in fully for three to four hours. The puzzles aren't particularly challenging at any part, there's no choices or branching story lines - and you won't mind. It's refreshing how streamlined and conservative Brothers is with it's mechanics, puzzles and set-pieces, and it deserves to be played both for and because of these aspects. The tone, whist initially whimsical, darkens considerably, to the point where I'd advise against playing the game with younger children. To give it a cinematic comparison, it starts off in Jim Henson's Labyrinth, moves into The Never-Ending Story, and ends... not joyfully. However; I wouldn't change a thing about it.\n\nIt is also very worth saying that just because you'll see the entire game in one or two play-throughs, it is still extremely re-playable and enjoyable each time. I fired up the game to check out the keyboard controls while writing this review and I felt an urge to play again immediately, which would make a fourth run at the game.\n\nThis really is a beautiful, innovative and rollicking yarn which asks for very little from the player and gives a ton back. The only hold-ups are the aforementioned potential control frustrations, and for those to whom it's a factor, the price. Not wishing to seem ♥♥♥♥♥rdly, for your average player, £12 for a three-hour game isn't great. When you take into account what you get for that price of entry, I'd have to say that yes, it is worth it, but I can't say I paid that for it as I picked up a cheap key. At half price this game is an absolute steal and should be purchased without reservation, at full price, give the points raised here a little thought before committing.\n\n8.5/10\nHe Ain't Heavy","December 23, 2013","true","11.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Its a game where you just want to stop and look at everything.\n\n+Varied environments throughout the game make the world feel more real and alive and provide a nice change of scenery\n\n+The game feels like a grand adventure in the span of only 3 hours. It does such a good job of the pacing and the puzzles that it feels like you just completed an epic quest.\n\n+Controller both brothers at the same time can be frustrating however it adds an extra element to the gameplay, and provides some interesting scenarios and puzzles.\n\n+Simple and yet effective story conveyed with no dialogue\n\nThe Bad\n\n-The game is very easy, the puzzles are not to challenging at all.\n\n- All achievements are optional and very missable requiring a guide to get them. If you don't care about achievements than this shouldn't be a problem\n\n- Although not required, you really need to play this with a controller.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn excellent adventure/puzzle game.

Every area in the game is lovingly crafted for gorgeous views. The animations on the characters are top notch, which is very important because there is no real dialogue in the game - they speak a form of gibberish but through the context, tone of voice, and body language you can generally understand what they're saying.\n\nI'm a heavy book reader, but the story and environment in this game rivals some of my favorite works. The feelings that this game invokes put to rest the debate on whether or not games can truly be an art form.\n\nThe gameplay is very novel and innovative and quite fun also. It's not lacking at all in that department - as a puzzle/adventure game, it goes where no other games have gone before and for that alone is worthy of being played.\n\nThis may not be my favorite game of all time - I may not be able to sink loads of time into it.

They say "if I wanted stories, I'd go watch a movie". Other people just feel that games without a story are unengaging and arid. To both groups I recommend Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Both will gain a new perspective.\n\nRarely a game manages to deliver such rich, emotional and well-developed storytelling. As a lifelong gamer, voracious reader and a professional that understands the power of drama, I can tell you that this game has it all. Every single element shows the maximum attention to detail, storywise.\n\nCareful planning and masterful presentation are noticeable at every single moment. Only a master storyteller, playwright or writer can achieve this. Music, setting, colors, sounds, environment, level design, camera angles, zooming, pacing, "dialogue" and a hint of mystery here and there make this game a superb and very enjoyable experience.\n\nThe world is rich and interesting and the characters are empathic and show more personality in 3 hours' worth of playing than most others from famous lengthy franchises or dull modern novels/movies. In a time and age of predictable endings, cookie-cutter stories, boring conventional scripting, forced and faked emotional stimuli and lame plot twists, Brothers brings a breath of fresh air.\n\nYes, the game is quite short for today's gaming standards. Bear in mind though that the narrative is excellent and the duration is perfect. Think theater or cinema: more than 3 hours would be just too much. This is more akin to that than to Call of Duty, Minecraft or Super Mario.\n\nThe controls at first are awkward but soon you'll get used to them. A gamepad is strongly recommended, and there's a reason for that.\n\nI am quite sure that you've never played a game like this. Bought it on sale; after finishing I would have gladly paid twice the regular price. The developers deserve it. It is that good.

Seriously, like, really good. But if you're still on the fence, or want more details, read on...\n\nYou play as two brothers, who you control at the same time using one controller (single player co-op, essentially). The left stick and left trigger button control the older brother's movement and all-purpose "action" ability, respectively, and the right stick and trigger similarly handle the younger brother's actions. For the first couple of minutes, controlling both characters simultaneously feels a bit awkward, but it quickly becomes second nature. The game does a nice job of easing you into the controls. Gameplay mainly consists of some basic platforming and solving puzzles using cooperation between the brothers. Brothers is not a challenging game whatsoever, and the path you take from start to finish is pretty much linear. On paper, those two things may seem like negatives. However, in conjunction with the rest of the experience, I felt the mechanics and ease of gameplay worked perfectly. This is not a game one plays for a challenge. It is a journey you take, experiencing the story of these brothers, in their quest to find a cure for their ailing father. This game is all about that journey, and experiencing the amazing sights and sounds of each new area and challenge that the brothers face. To add any significant amount of frustration to that experience would have been a huge disservice to the game. It feels just perfectly balanced exactly as it is. And that is all I am going to say (to get into any more specifics would defeat the purpose of experiencing it for yourself).\n\nBrothers can be completed in roughly 3-4 hours. Even though that's not a lot, I felt it was just about right. What you get out of this game is well worth every penny, even with the short length. This is, of course, assuming that you are into these sorts of low key, emotional game experiences. If that's not your cup of tea, you may want to skip it. But for anyone else, if you are at all open to these sorts of games, you absolutely must play this at some point (though I would recommend sooner than later, so as to avoid getting inadvertently spoiled).\n\nTechnical notes: On the store page for this game, it states that a controller is required. While technically that isn't true (there are settings for keyboard in the launcher options), there IS a reason it says that. I really, really, REALLY do not recommend playing this without a controller. The wired Xbox360 controller works natively with no problem, but I would assume anything with two analog sticks and left/right triggers should be fine. The game was clearly designed around using a controller, and I just don't see how using a keyboard could possibly replicate that "zen" experience of becoming one with the controls well enough.

In fairness it's only one of the bold decisions the developers made with Brothers, and for me most (if not all) of them worked.\nThe use of dual analog sticks; the belief in their storytelling being strong enough to not include subtitles to translate the pseudo-langauge they created within the game; and ultiamtely the story you experience.\n\nIt's a short review for a short game that lasted just shy of 3 hours in total, and the only thing I can really end this recommendation is:\n\nIf you enjoy indie games and the 'Art' experience they often deliver this for you.

And as you get closer to the end it gets more and more gruesome and morbid. Although first it seems like a fantasy game for children, especially due to casual gameplay and visual style, I'm not sure I can recommend a child play it.\n\nGameplay-wise it is very casual and will not make you replay long sequences or test your hardcore gamer skills. But it's not mindless either. The balance is very precise to make it a game but not allow gameplay overshadow story or visual/audio beauty and immersiveness.\n\nI feel that creators were influenced by many classic games, and weave the influences very organically into the game. There is definitely strong influence from Ico in castle chapters. There is also very deep controller trick reminiscent of Metal Gear's one.\n\nOverall, this game seems perfect labor of love with no visible flaws. Except that in my opinion it's a mature game which can be easily mistaken for a child game, so the target audience will most probably not play it.\n\nHighly recommended.","December 25, 2013","true","3.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/225080/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","I'll cut right to the chase on this one - this game is amazing. Seriously, like, really good. But if you're still on the fence, or want more details, read on...\n\nYou play as two brothers, who you control at the same time using one controller (single player co-op, essentially). The left stick and left trigger button control the older brother's movement and all-purpose "action" ability, respectively, and the right stick and trigger similarly handle the younger brother's actions. For the first couple of minutes, controlling both characters simultaneously feels a bit awkward, but it quickly becomes second nature. The game does a nice job of easing you into the controls. Gameplay mainly consists of some basic platforming and solving puzzles using cooperation between the brothers. Brothers is not a challenging game whatsoever, and the path you take from start to finish is pretty much linear. On paper, those two things may seem like negatives. However, in conjunction with the rest of the experience, I felt the mechanics and ease of gameplay worked perfectly. This is not a game one plays for a challenge. It is a journey you take, experiencing the story of these brothers, in their quest to find a cure for their ailing father. This game is all about that journey, and experiencing the amazing sights and sounds of each new area and challenge that the brothers face. To add any significant amount of frustration to that experience would have been a huge disservice to the game. It feels just perfectly balanced exactly as it is. And that is all I am going to say (to get into any more specifics would defeat the purpose of experiencing it for yourself).\n\nBrothers can be completed in roughly 3-4 hours. Even though that's not a lot, I felt it was just about right. What you get out of this game is well worth every penny, even with the short length. This is, of course, assuming that you are into these sorts of low key, emotional game experiences. If that's not your cup of tea, you may want to skip it. But for anyone else, if you are at all open to these sorts of games, you absolutely must play this at some point (though I would recommend sooner than later, so as to avoid getting inadvertently spoiled).\n\nTechnical notes: On the store page for this game, it states that a controller is required. While technically that isn't true (there are settings for keyboard in the launcher options), there IS a reason it says that. I really, really, REALLY do not recommend playing this without a controller. The wired Xbox360 controller works natively with no problem, but I would assume anything with two analog sticks and left/right triggers should be fine. The game was clearly designed around using a controller, and I just don't see how using a keyboard could possibly replicate that "zen" experience of becoming one with the controls well enough. But hey... do whatcha gotta do.","September 4, 2013","true","3.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It requires a controller to play but that is half the fun. The left side of the controller is for the older brother while the right side is the younger brother. This makes the puzzle solving a bit more interesting in that a few times I found myself mixing up the buttons resulting in one brothers unfortunate death.\nThis game has a lot to offer though even in the limited 3-4 hours it takes to complete the game with all the achievements. The story and characters are extremely likable and recognizable even though the language they use is completely imaginary. The art really got me too, there are these benches you can sit down in to observe the surroundings in a wide view; and I often hesitated to move on in the levels just to spend a few minutes taking in the scenery.\nPeople of all ages will enjoy this game, so check it out if you ever get the chance.","May 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

This game is about two sons setting out on a quest to find some magic water to cure their sick father. The graphics are sinle, but perfectly suited to the game and there are some truly beautiful vistas you can see as you go through the world. There are some moments that are tense but overall the game was not difficult. It's definitely more a game you play to experience the world than for a challenge. But I highly recommend it for people who are into short, interesting experiences.\n\nOn a side note, I would highly recommend this game be played as co-op with a good friend if you can. I played with a friend on an Xbox controller with me controlling one brother and my friend controlling the other. This works since the older brother is controlled via left trigger + left stick and the younger brother is controlled via right trigger + right stick.

The puzzles aren't hard but controlling the brothers are quite confusing sometimes which results in one (or both) of their deaths and you have to restart again (which is also a pain in the ♥♥♥ for taking 1~2 minutes to reach the place where you failed in some cases)\nI'll say it is a solid 10/10 despite some of the awkward moments I mentioned.","June 26, 2014","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I mean, if you just shrug away every visual here, you have to be dead inside. Okay, it also had some parts where I just shook my head, but, eh, if you take it for what it is, more like a moviepuzzle-experience, it's certainly worth getting.\nIf, however, you expect a very engaging puzzle-platformer, this is probably not the game for you.

The dual character control from one controller is easy to pick up, and the various puzzles and gameplay elements introduced throughout the game keep the control style from getting stale.\n\nMany aspects of the journey of the brothers involve helping others, and in return, they help the brothers to advance through the various areas and puzzles, which is delivered wonderfully and seamlessly (no fetch quests).  With a more peaceful overtone to the game, when you do encounter the few “violent” pieces of the game they have that much greater impact and dig a bit deeper into your emotions.\n\nThe graphics, environment/set design, and audio are all very well done.  On your journey you pass through many beautiful landscapes with perfectly matched gentle music scores and ambience, dark and dreary battlefields with ominous overtones, and magical places with quite a unique and mystical feel.\n\n“Brothers” is a wonderful experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to fill 3 hours with a memorable, fun, and sometimes ‘heart-string pulling’, time.\n","January 1, 2014","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is about two sons setting out on a quest to find some magic water to cure their sick father. The graphics are sinle, but perfectly suited to the game and there are some truly beautiful vistas you can see as you go through the world. There are some moments that are tense but overall the game was not difficult. It's definitely more a game you play to experience the world than for a challenge. But I highly recommend it for people who are into short, interesting experiences.\n\nOn a side note, I would highly recommend this game be played as co-op with a good friend if you can. I played with a friend on an Xbox controller with me controlling one brother and my friend controlling the other. This works since the older brother is controlled via left trigger + left stick and the younger brother is controlled via right trigger + right stick. It really added a dynamic to the game that I think you wouldn't be able to get in single player.","January 6, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

It pains me to say that, definitively, there is no way in hell this deserves a 90 on metacritic and I felt very misled in my expectations, which is why I feel the need to compensate with a harsh review. While Brothers is a decent enough game, it is not 'Game of the Year' material. Remember, this is the game that BEAT OUT GTA5, Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider at the VGX. It boggles the mind.  Any themes it treads have been done much better elsewhere, and the novel puzzling mechanics, while somewhat interesting, are few and far between and often recycled one after another in sequence. I kept waiting for it to heat up, but the big kick never came.\n\nI was led to believe there would be an intensely emotional story, and it was clear that the game was really reaching to provide one. The key ingredient in stories involving loss is that you have a connection to the characters involved. When none of them speak a line of meaningful dialog, that raises the bar significantly and puts the burden on the development of the actors through their actions. A good movie can take us inside the hearts of a fictional character and experience their sense of profound loss within 2 hours. Brothers had three and a half to get the job done, but never bothered to attempt to pick up the slack at all. Any acting done by any of the characters in the game is limited to simple pantomime, or broadly simplistic generalities. There are no facial expressions to appreciate, there are no meaningful challenges of character, there aren't even any gameplay choices that would write in some of the blanks yourself. So to compensate for any true connection to the characters, every 'emotional' scene is accompanied by a haunting soundtrack with string instruments and a lady chanting "ehhhhhhhh oooh ehhhhhhhhhh OOOOO", which sure IS KIND OF NICE (Don't get me wrong), but it's the equivalent of the "Applause" sign coming on for an audience and awkward in how hard it tries to manipulate you. It boils down to cartoonish looking characters crying while you sit in your seat feeling embarrassed for the game. I was so very disappointed.\n\nThe mechanic of using both sticks to control each character did shine through in a few instances. When the brothers tether themselves together with a rope and use it to navigate treacherous ruins, it seemed as though it was finally getting into its stride. The tutorial levels were over! And now it could begin in earnest! Then the game ended. Whoops.\n\nThe visuals were decent, but nothing extraordinary, however the character animations were poor.

Well in this game, the father spends the entire game doing the same writhing & moaning animation (On a 5 second loop) while lying for days on top of a kitchen table. The artists couldn't even be bothered to draw a bed. Or even a pillow. Come on!\n\nSo did I like Brothers? Yes, I liked it. There are some interesting parts. Maybe even some good parts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cleanaf/recommended/225080/","Cleanaf","That's Clean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cleanaf/","70 products in account","IntroBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons. This game really touches your heart in many different ways. Before I dive into the specifics of the game, I'll go over the generalities. I'll have a more in-depth review of the ending for the people that have actually completed the game with analysis, themes, meanings, etc.\n\nStory:Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a story based puzzle game. The basic story revolves around two sons and their journey to help their father who has been struck with an illness. The brothers are forced to solve some puzzles guaranteed to make you think and help many different characters along the way. In this short 2-4 hour adventure, the game still managed to make me feel a genuine concern for each and every character introduced along the way. Not many games can really do that.\n\nControls/Gameplay:The controls are challenging, to say the least. Depending on whether you use a controller or the keyboard, the left joystick and left trigger control the older brother while the right stick and right trigger control the younger brother. Likewise, on the keyboard, WASD will control one of the brothers and the arrow keys will control another, the space bar and ctrl button taking place of the triggers. Despite these being the only controls in the game for movement and action, I found myself constantly confusing myself on which of the brothers I was controlling. This wasn't really a frustration, but it did allow for some amusing points in the game where both brothers would be running into a wall. As for the gameplay, the game pits you against puzzles throughout your adventure. The puzzle difficulty increases as the game progresses, but I wouldn't say that there were any puzzles that will keep you stuck in the game for more than 2 minutes. Many puzzles require the two brothers to use teamwork, leading to some rewarding moments upon completing a puzzle.\n\nGraphics/PresentationThe graphics fit into the games core design and mood very well. Running on the unreal engine, the game runs very smooth and I encountered no significant FPS drops during the game. From being high up in the mountains to running across glacier ice caps, the game looked beautiful throughout. The game won't blow you away compared to games running on the more powerful engines of Battlefield and Crysis, but Brothers does its job very well. The music in this game is also top notch. The music definitely sets the mood and makes the player feel a certain way. Flawless execution there.\n\nFinal Thoughts:Even though I find many positives to say for the game, I feel that this kind of game wouldn't be fit for everyone. Although it may seem appealing to many people from reviews and video clips, this game is suited towards a more mature audience. If you are a type of person to play games seeking pure entertainment and wants the game to give you more than you put into it, I recommend you not buy it. I also think that the $15 pricing is a bit too steep. I really wanted to play this game for a while, and I only purchased it after it went on sale for $1.50. If you are willing to pay $15 for a 2-4 hour game, then by all means, do so. I do feel that the developers deserve that much, but the game doesn't give you $15 of content. Instead, it gives you a memorable gaming experience with many things to remember and think back on. This is the type of game that people will complete and spend a lot of time thinking about what just happened. What this game lacks in content it makes up for in memorability.\n\nFinal Rating: 9/10 (missing 1 point from length of actual game)\n\nSPOILERS. THIS PORTION IS ANALYSIS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMPLETED THE GAMEThere will be many people that complete the game and do not see it as I do. However, the ending is a lot more dense then what you actually play through. If you put yourself in the shoes of the younger brother, the game does feel a lot more harder to bear. Your older brother just died. Throughout the whole game, you and your older brother were inseparable. If you went too far off, you would stop and you would call your older brother over. If your older brother went too far off, he would stop and call you over. If there was something that you couldn't do, you could do it with the help of your older brother. Your flaws in strength and inability to swim are gone with the help of your brother. If you couldn't reach something, your brother was there to boost you up. You became perfect. Unstoppable. With your brother by your side, nothing could go wrong. But now, he's dead.\n\nYou aren't immortal. Your flaws are back. If something goes wrong, you don't have your older brother to turn to. Not only that, you have to dig a grave for your brother and then bury him with your own hands. If you didn't think about this during your first playthrough, I suggest you replay that portion of the game and think about this. Upon burying your brother, you are taken back to your hometown. But you aren't taken back right away. You fly over the glaciers, through the mountains, past the castle. You are shown all the places that you have been to be able to get the medicine to heal your father. Getting through all these places would not have been possible without your older brother. When you arrive back to your hometown, you come across water. You can't swim, how are you going to get across? Normally, you would press the action button for the younger brother and grab onto the older brother. But this time, you press the action button of the older brother. Your brother's voice echos through your head as you swim for the first time across the lake. You come across a switch that you're too weak to pull. Again, you press the action button for the older brother and manage to pull the switch down. You come across a ledge you can't reach. Once again, you make it up while pressing the action button for the older brother. Using the action button for the older brother makes it seem that you are borrowing the strength of the older brother to do things that you normally couldn't. Keeping his older brother in mind, the younger brother is able to do things he would normally be unable to do in order to complete both of their goals: saving their father. The final cutscene shows the father crying over the older brother's grave, but the younger brother stands in silent mourning. The younger brother knows that even thought his older brother is gone, his voice will be with him and empower him to continue to push himself to do things beyond his own power.\n\nQuick Last ThoughtsThroughout the whole game, the younger brother is seen to have a close connection with the mother. The opening cutscene shows him mourning over his mother's death, midway through the game, the younger brother has a dream about his mother, and at the end of the game, he gets a vision of his mother who influences him to swim across the water. The older brother is seen to have a close connection with the father. After the initial opening cutscene, the older brother comes to the younger brother and asks for help to get their father to the doctor. Midway through the game, the older brother has a flashback to him and the father fishing. At then end of the game, those close connections are gone. It can be implied that the older brother-mother and the younger brother-father weren't as close as  younger-mother older-father. At the end of the game, the older brother is with the mother and the father is with the younger brother. With that, both bonds can become stronger.\n\nGreat game. If did not manage to see these connections on your first play through, I suggest going through the ending once more.","December 29, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

You want to see some adventures of characters, who you can (or want to) relate to. It's an old formula, take some kids and send them for a quest for the sake of the family, on a road where they will face scary monsters and challenges and overcome their fears.\n\nWhat most prefer to ignore is that fairy tales are pretty gruesome. Someone alwayse dies in those stories, be it an old king or a dragon, and dies in a rather displeasing way. It's not a fairy tale without a pinch of sorrow in it, and not everything is well after the happy end - monsters and kings remain pretty much dead anyways.\n\nWith this game I managed to look at Starbreeze studios from a very different point of view.

Considering it's a fairly short title (about 3 hours long), which might put some people off it is surprisingly worth it's value. Brothers presents you astonishing visuals along with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a game. Brothers doesn't really tell you a story like most games out there, it shows you the story by using a made up language, as I mentioned above, you are not presented with a certain and linear story but the way each brother interacts and uses body language to express himself gives you a good feeling of what's going on. Another thing I love about this game is how the developers decided to show you that these two brothers are inseparable, you control each one with a different stick on the controller but yet each puzzle or obstacle cannot be exceeded by using a single brother, one brother needs the other in order to survive... Besides this, everything else I have to say is abunch of spoilers and things that would ruin the way you would experience this game for the first time. I have nothing else to say other than, please buy the game, if not by paying full price atleast try to get it once it's on sale (like I did), we need more games like this, I need more games like this. Definitely one of my favourite games of all time, taking the top 1 place on best storytelling for me and bringing The Walking Dead to top 2.\n\nBe amazed by Brothers!","November 1, 2013","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's just like a regular RPG, but as you probably already know, instead of just controlling just one character, or brother, at a time, you control both at the same time. The puzzles that were designed around this gameplay mechanic are awesome and really fun to do, along with the immersing story and well developed atmosphere.\n\nThe main plot is set around two brothers, or two sons, that are on a quest to save their father, who is deathly ill. Their mother had drowned previously and the brothers don't want to lose their dad as well, so they set out to find the special liquid from a magical tree, which is the only thing that can save him. There are absolutely no distinguishable words throughout the whole game, apart from some basic instructions on how to control both brothers at the very start, but the story is still super smooth and easy to follow, so the lack of words won't mess up your understanding of what’s going on. No spoilers here, but the story of the brothers and their “adventures” is really good, you might even cry.\n\nThere are enough levels included in the game to make it long enough. It's only around 3-5 hours, but I reckon it's just the right length to keep a story as this one interesting. Every level is a new experience and there are always new things to do, even with the basic controls, (you only use the triggers and thumb sticks). Hang gliding, throwing balls down wells, riding mountain goats and sitting on benches and looking at the view are only some of the things you can do to keep yourself entertained in this amazing game.\n\nSo, the real question is, should you buy this game? Absolutely, I guarantee you'll have a great time with it. It's a little short, but don't let that stop you from getting it.

I bought it for mere 2 euros then, but after playing the game I can assure you that it is even worth the full price.\n\nThroughout my gaming years I have encountered many different games with many different stories, gameplay mechanics, etc. But this game stands out as a unique example of a gaming masterpiece. Why, might you ask yourself?\n\nFirst, the game tells a story that maybe isn't the most original story ever told before, but the way it presents itself is simply amazing. You will almost instantly develop emotional connection with both of the brothers and it will last till the very last moment of the game. I can count with one hand the number of games that had such an emotional impact on me as this game did.\n\nSecond, the mechanics and gameplay are something I've never seen before. The reason Steam warns you that you need a controller to play is because you control both brothers at the same time. It seems tricky, but in reality is very natural and fluid. You will get a hold of it in minutes. I liked the concept.\n\nAll things being said, this game is short, but will take you on such emotional rollercoaster in it's 3-4 hours of story that you will never forget.\n\nMust play.","September 7, 2014","true","6.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In fact, I think this game would actually have suffered with understandable voice acting. The puzzles weren't incredibly challenging, but they were fun, and I felt good after I completed them. There were some weird moments here and there where the puzzles only seemed to come from poor design choices on the part of the game's inhabitants, but they were outweighed by the rest of the game in a big way.\n\nThe only real con is that the game is pretty short. It is one of my more expensive games in terms of dollars per hour, but picking it up during a sale really helped to ease that pain.","October 3, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

When the brothers switch places on screen (big is on right, small is on left, controls are static for big on left, small on right) that controlling them becomes a confusing matter and suddenly one dude is going the other direction. You kind of have to stop, have them run to the "correct" sides of the screen and then work on a puzzle. Then I'm good and can play it without losing the pacing.\n\nAudio is very sublime, graphics are absurdly atmospheric, the whole fantasy is just really fantastic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackchaos619/recommended/225080/","blackchaos619","BurakChaaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackchaos619/","322 products in account","This is my first proper recommendation of a game on Steam. Because no other game that I have ever played has provoked my emotions in a way Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons has.\n\nThe story of two brothers against the world, fighting to save their father. A simple story, but the way it is told has to be one of the most breath-taking experiences a video game can muster. I can't say much with regards to the story except that if story-driven games are your thing, you have to play.\n\nEvery little aspect of this game, from the game controls to the language spoken by the brothers helps you connect with them, their troubles, their fears, their emotions. No game has so far captivated me this quickly and this deeply, although I am probably feeling this way because I just finished it. And that's just fine. This game is a masterpiece that everyone should experience.\n\nSome brief review notes:\nDo not judge the game solely based on the first few minutes of gameplay, as the puzzles and co-operative mechanics develop at an amazing pace. The ideas in the game are innovative, not repetitively used and are a lot of fun to experience.\n\nControls-wise, this game definitely has to be played with a controller with two joysticks to get the most out of the game. The keyboard controls are manageable but a controller is best. However, there are times where you are required to hold down the buttons for minutes on end which is quite stressful on the fingers.\n\nThe graphics and art are nothing special, although some of the scenes do inspire some awe in you. The game isn't about the art however and the deciding factor in whether you want to play a game should almost never be graphical quality.\n\nBrothers makes use of the controller in a way no other game I've played has ever done. That could be my inexperience talking, but the innovative way you control the two brothers using a joystick and shoulder pad each pulls you into the game and doesn't let go. It takes some getting used to of course, but a helpful tip is to try and keep the younger brother on the right as much as possible as it helps coordinate better early on.\n\nThe speech in the game is no known language. And this is one of the best features of this game. The story does not rely on voice acting or script, but the true weight and emotion of the story itself as well as the body language and gestures of the characters. Very few games have managed to pull this off to the degree that Brothers has and I fear no other would be able to live up to this quality of story for a long time.\n\nPuzzle platformer games are nothing new. Many games have a tried and tested formula to them. Brothers on the other hand is a game that no other game would make you go: "Oh, this is just like that other game." No. That will never happen. Because the mechanics of the game, they way you solve every problem, the satisfaction of achieving the goal while controlling both brothers at the same time is a unique experience in itself.\nTL;DR If you love video games for what they truly are, you owe it to yourself to play this game. No game will ever be like this game. Ever.\n\nBros before hoes.","January 18","true","4.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is above all a story told with no more than pseudowords and names (I'm thinking it's not really a conlang they speak) and an accurate soundtrack that fits perfectly with each sequence. The plot itself is rather simple. Two brothers must save their father who is terribly ill. For that they have to reach the Tree of Life and harvest the water that springs from its center. A lot happens, and I can just say that the whole journey is unforgettable.\n\nThe whole artwork and design is at times reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus and ICO, in which the player journeys into and out of the dreamlike “Forbidden Lands”. The very concept of travel, journey and quest is essential to the whole atmosphere of both games, and it works the same way in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. (Also, one can see how the couple's escape in ICO and the wanderer's quest to save his loved one in SotC might have influenced Starbreeze.)\n\nAs to gameplay, the controls feel very awkward at first, and even by the end of the game I still struggled here and there. But they never get to the point of breaking immersion. On the contrary: for me playing this game feels exactly as it should — you must control both brothers simultaneously rather than alternating between the two as is commonly done. This is especially effective in one particular chapter, in a way which I won’t comment in order to avoid spoilers.\n\nThough the game is short, I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in the  style  of game I vaguely call “an experience”. Indeed, unless you are too impatient with unconventional, inventive controls (in which case you will hate this game), I say this game is definitely worth a try.","June 29, 2014","true","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

When you journey, you'll see the intrinsically beautiful game world and level designs. The OSTs just add more to the awesomeness, so atmospheric and fitting.\n\nGameplay is quite simple as you only need to move around and solve simple puzzles. There's a bit annoying boss battles but it's nothing anyway if you play many more of challenging games nowadays like Bastion. Though, really, the major strength of the game lies not in its gameplay but in its storyline - despite the voice actors speak in made-up language (no English caption sorry!), it can convey the story with the body language and display. Following the story is also another great experience. You'll see the value of your sibling, or brotherhood, through how the two brothers here work together and lend a hand to to each others. Sometimes we forget about that siblings are wonderful gift, eh?\n\nCheckpoints are scattered throughout the game so suppose you die from accidental glitches - yes, happened to me - or die in boss battles you don't have to retrack your steps too far. The game offers chapter to chapter selection so you can easily replay the chapter you want to rewatch.\n\nWhile the controller is recommended (xinput based works flawlessly while dinput requires x360ce to play), you can also use keyboard to play the game. Heck, you can coop using gamepad for first player and keyboard for the second player, though it's a bit awkward to play coop in a game like this. That said, controlling two brothers using gamepad, which is recommended, can be a bit awkward at first as usually we use the right stick to aim or shoot not to move.\n\nIf you want to have a perfect achievements, it's not hard. Basically everything can be done in one playthrough - and that also makes the game quite limited in replayability. zero reason to replay the game unless you just want to remember the story.\n\nI myself got this from Amazon with Editor's Choice Coupon 2014 enabled, around 2.5 USD in total. At this price, it's a bargain. Paying full price is, for me, rather not recommended as the game's too short. You can finish the game in one sitting, 4 hours total gameplay. 5 hours if you backtrack to get the achievements you missed.\n\nBut overall, an excellent game to be added to your library AND to be played. Believe me, it's a good game right from the concept, storyline and implementation. Looking forward to the next game of Starbreeze Studios AB.","January 10, 2014","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's quite clever in how it ties in the surroundings, story, and gameplay.  And do have fun on all the benchs.  The dual character control in one controller takes some getting used to, but is not difficult.  My only complaint is that the puzzles were a little on the simple side.  If you've played Tomb Raider, then you'll breeze through it.  Take your time to enjoy the scenery, though. So much effort was put into making this game, I felt bad I got it on sale.

And now they are faced with a new\nalarming situation, their father is ill and will soon die.\n\nThe two brothers sets out on a adventure to recover\na magic three juice that will save their father.\n\n---REVIEW---\n\nTo start of, this is one of the prettiest indie games\nI have ever played. The graphics and art design is\nreally outstanding, and I found myself stopping up\nfor a brief period of time to just look at the\nscenery. Some of the scenery just left me in awe,\nit's a really unique world and the graphical style\nfrom the landscape to the creatures in this game\nis really wonderful.\n\nThe world in this game is truly stunning.\n\nThe audio is also getting a huge thumbs up from me.\nA huge variety of fantastic sound effects and a\nsoundtrack which really fits inn with the situations\nyou encounter in this game and the world we're\ntaking part of.\n\nThe gameplay is special, creative and fun. I will note tho,\nthat a game controller IS required to play this game, and I\nwill explain why. In this game you control both of the two\nbrothers at the same time, the way they did this was dedicating\none of the two analog sticks to each of the brothers and one\nshoulder button to each of the brothers. With the left analog stick\nand shoulder button you control the eldest brother, and with the\nright analog stick and shoulder button you control the youngest.\n\nThis is a really fun and creative way to do this, and often brings\norientation difficulty during some situations. When the two brothers\ncross over to the opposite side of the screen from each other,\nthe control sheme stays the same, so the controls in a way\nbecomes inverted. It's a fun challenge and I found myself\nduring some situations just stopping up to get my orientation stright.\n\nThe game combines this special control aspect of the game with\nsome intriguing puzzles, which will require some multitasking.\nNone of the puzzles is especially hard to do, but they were fun\nand creative. Tho because the game developers went for the choise\nof giving this world an imaginary language, and not specially\nmuch written text at all, there were a few situations I was lost\nas of what I was supposed to do, but not for long.\n\nAs for the story in this game, it's really good. You'll get immersed\nin this world and continue adventuring to try finding a cure for\nyour dying father. You'll encounter some really dark situations in\nthis game, dark emotional situations, some of the situations\nyou encounter might get to you and make you just think over\nwhat just happened. It's not a tale of happy rainbows and chocolate,\nit's a mature journey which will bring up subjects like death, suicide\nand the strong bond between two brothers.\n\nI spent approximately 3.1 hours completing this game, so it's not\nespecially long, and because this game really doesn't\nbring much replay-value into it, I find the price tag of 14€ to\nbe a tiny bit too much, to be honest. But, this is an exceptionally\nbeautiful and mature tale of two brothers, in one of the prettiest\ngame worlds I've seen, so the 14€'s was worth it.\n\n---SCORE---\n\nI will pull some points off from "Value", because of short game time\nand little to none replay-value.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nAudio: 9.0/10\nGameplay: 9.0/10\nStory: 9.0/10\nValue: 7.0/10\n\nScore: 8.7/10","April 10, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Having just lost their mother to drowning at sea, and now on the verge of losing their gravely ill father, the two titular brothers set off on a surreal journey to obtain the one thing able to cure him. The story unfolds without words (at least, not words that are comprehensible), using body language, music and nuance in a manner that is masterfully handled and pulls you straight in.\n\nGameplay, unfortunately, is where Brothers suffers. Firstly, you NEED to use an Xbox 360 controller. Each brother is controlled individually with each control stick, proving to have a steep learning curve. This essentially gives an illusion of co-op, which while visually interesting and making both of their movements feel organic (rather than an NPC programmed to follow you), it proves to be quite frustrating at first as you frequently lose track of which stick controls which brother. Another downside is that it's also quite short and can be finished in only a few hours.\n\nAtmosphere, story and visuals are this game's bread and butter. Despite the frustrating gameplay, if you're fond of games strong on story that tug at your heartstrings and leave you thinking long after the credits have rolled, I can't recommend this highly enough.","April 9, 2014","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkStarSword/recommended/225080/","DarkStarSword","DarkStarSword","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkStarSword/","853 products in account","Quite an enjoyable game with a very moving story told in a unique way.\n\nFirstly, you *need* a twin stick controller to play this - you *might* be able to kludge your way through with the keyboard, but you really don't want to. If you don't have one, go in to the City and buy an XBox 360 controller right now - I'll wait.... OK, you have one? Good.\n\nNow, I love a game with a good story, but let's be honest - in most games the story and gameplay are somewhat disconnected from each other and could just as easily be presented as two separate pieces of art. Heck, there are some games that would have done better to throw away one (or two!) of those pieces altogether!\n\nThis game is different - the story and the gameplay are both perfectly intertwined. Sure, it still has cutscenes, but the story is largely conveyed while you control the brothers throughout their journey. This game has managed to figure out how to use the unique properties of a video game to tell it's story, rather than relying on techniques from movies or novels like every other game.\n\nThere is also, no speach - well, at least not English. The characters do use body language and speak some kind of made up language to effectively convey emotion and meaning, without distracting from the story or journey at hand. If you have ever played The Sims or The Singles it's similar to the spoken "language" in those games.\n\nThe story is very moving - I don't really want to spoil anything, especially as the game is not all that long and I couldn't do anywhere near as good a job as the game itself does. The basic premise is that the two brothers have to go on a journey far beyond their village, past troll mines and Giant's cities to find a tree that produces a healing exiler to cure their sick father (or so I gather - no English, remember?). I won't say anything more - you need to play it.\n\nThe gameplay is also pretty unique - at it's heart it's really a puzzle platformer where you have to use the strengths and weaknesses of each brother  to manipulate levers to move obstacles to allow both to progress on your journey. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult, but they are still satisfying and there is enough variety that the gameplay never outstays it's welcome.\n\nWhat makes the gameplay unique is that you control both brothers *simultaneousely* with both of the sticks on the controller. This can lead to a bit of brain♥♥♥♥ at times - often coping with that that was more difficult than the puzzles themselves, but it doesn't take long to get used to and is never a serious problem (so long as you remember which button is which brother when you need to let go of a ledge).\n\nYou can usually pick this up from Green Man Gaming (unlocks on Steam) with whatever 20-25% coupon they have on offer at the time.

A gamepad is a must for this game, each thumb stick controls one of the brothers, while the corresponding trigger causes each brother to take action.  In order to progress thru an environment you will have to traverse and interact with it, using each brother to manipulate different parts of the environment to move on.  The scheme works much better than I thought it would, rarely did controlling each brother at the same time feel cumbersome and after some practice it felt natural.\nVisually the game is very pretty, you will explore different scenery like mountains and ice, and come face to face with a vast array of NPC’s in the form of animals, giants, ferries and a host of others.  The sound is appropriate to the fantasy setting, the characters speak in a made up language, so most of the story is told thru gestures and the visuals along with the musical score, it all works together to give the gaming world a unique feeling of life.  It’s a short game, clocking in at 4 hours or so, but its just long enough to feel like you went on an adventure without getting repetitive.  Brothers is imaginative, not very violent & will challenge your brain just enough to feel like you accomplished something without frustrating you, very balanced and enjoyable experience.","April 26, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Instead excellent design gets will be enough to get you through this game\n-Simply stunning visuals.\n-Emotion is carried out extremely well without any dialogue.\n-Puzzles are very innovative and fun.\n-Variety of environmental hazards and visuals keep the game fresh.\n-Zero GUI elements make gives the game a clean and simplistic feel\n\nCons:\n-Puzzles can be a bit too easy.\n-Game length may be a bit short, however the price you pay for the game reflects that\n\n\nBottom Line: A must play for any gamer, you'll leave the game with some personal emotional impact.

What first looked to me like a small-time indie game that probably wasn't worth my time ended up being one of the most phenomenal titles I've ever played.\n\nThis game tells an engaging story without a single word of spoken English; characters speak complete gibberish yet still convey emotion incredibly. It's only a 2.5-3 hour experience but it doesn't need to be any longer, it's the perfect length to finish in a single sitting and you will never feel that it has outstayed its welcome. The level and puzzle design is perfectly done, you should never need to think overly hard and you should always have a good idea of where you're meant to be going and what you're meant to be doing.\n\nGraphically the game really holds its own. I can see this title being one of those timeless games that never quite looks outdated visually; it's bright, colorful and charming. It should also be noted that the control system is unusual but not bad at all, you control each brother with a separate analog stick and bumper and it works perfectly that way. Also, that's me recommending that you play this game with a gamepad, the keyboard controls work but are nowhere near as comfortable.\n\nIf you have any taste in games at all you should purchase this game, lock yourself away from any distractions, pick up your gamepad and play through this game in a single sitting.

You will not regret it. This is a work of art. 95/100 does not come easily.\n\nPlot: Two brothers set off on a journey to find a magical medicine in order to cure their very ill father. This journey throughout this fantastical world takes them to many places, many scenes and environments, and they meet many people in their attempt to find the magic cure.\n\nI purchased this game as an afterthought. I had some extra cash and 2 bucks sale price is good for a game I heard was good. Where I heard that, or when, I have no idea. I started off and was immediately impressed at how fluid the controls were. Very simplistic. One analog stick and trigger for the younger brother, and another set for the older brother. I feel the game is best played with a controller, but I won't stop you from using KB + M.\nControls: 25/25\n\nThe play itself is quite linear. There is a set path to be taken to the set destination. I'm not going to detract many points for linear play, because they pull it off very well and it fits in with the story. The mechanics are fairly straightforward, one button for "Interact." The puzzles were towards the easier side and involved one the brothers doing independent things to advance on their journey. The gameplay was enjoyable and very smooth. Aside from the linearity, there were some 'side quests' that offered no actual benefit, but were fun and felt worth doing regardless.\nGameplay: 22/25\n\nThe graphics and art style are phenomenal. I was blown away by the detail of the enironment and the cutscenes. The plant life, the skies, the clouds, the mountains, the snow. Every bit was very impressive. I don't care if my dude is dangling from a rope several hunred feet in the air, I just really want to look at the mountains. It's not attempting to be hyper-realistic, it's more cartoony, and I feel that it pulls it off extraordinarily.\nGraphics: 23/25\n\nThe atmosphere was really engrossing in this title. The music added so much to the tone and the entire soundtrack is amazinga adds so much to the experience. Another part of the atmosphere is the environmental aspects are the fauna and the various background elementS really add to the entire experience. I don't want to name any so as to dampen your experience stumbling upon them, but they are great.\nAtmosphere: 25/25\n\nSo in conclusion, I very much enjoyed this game and I think that most everyone will. I strongly recommend that you buy it.","June 25, 2014","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Maybe it's the 'ship it unfinished and patch it later' mentality, anti-consumer drm, emphasis on pre-orders with exclusive bonuses, big publishers inability to push anything that isn't a AAA military shooter, micro-transactions, you name it. I find it hard to excited about upcoming titles, and even developers that I previously thought could do no wrong (Blizzard, Bethesda, Bioware, Dice etc) are all dropping the ball in big ways. All of this makes finding a gem like this title all the more appealing.\n\nBrothers is an adventure game in which you control two characters at the same time, using both sides of your controller. This immediately makes the game feel fresh - it's almost like playing a coop game with yourself as a partner. It feels weird initially, but it works, and immediately builds a bond with both characters and the player. The controls are tight and movement is fluid and smoothly animated. Graphically, the game is stunning. While not being incredible on a technical level, it combines solid visual quality with a striking, memorable art style that creates a truly immersive and beautiful world. The landscapes are richly detailed and often have a story behind them that you can pick up if you pay attention. The environments are varied and it has an incredible sense of scale that almost reminds me of the God of War games (not that this is a button mashing gore fest, but it has that enormous scope that can make you feel very very insignificant).\n\nThe characters are memorable, both the brothers and the individuals you meet along the way are loaded with personality, the animation is fluent and they are all wonderfully unique. Interestingly, not a word of English is spoken, but the expressiveness of the voice acting and the animation mean that you understand everything that is happening perfectly. The music is also memorable, the instrumentation is striking and I love the use of space and silence in the score.\n\nInitially, the only negative I could think of was the length of the game. I finished it in around 3 hours, and I took my time. I have since changed my mind - I feel that the story being told would have started to drag if it went on significantly over that, and although I wish I could play it more, the amount of gameplay they pack in is fantastic. The areas are varied and interesting, the puzzles and platforming are challenging enough so that you have to pay attention, but never so hard that you get stuck. I was initially going to write about some of the many unique moments that are part of this game, but they are probably best experienced first hand. Definately some suprise moments.\n\nBrothers has reminded me of why I love this medium. I cannot recommend this game enough.","January 1, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Keyboard controls are available, but a recurring puzzle in the game requires you to rotate both control sticks which for obvious reasons becomes a major pain when you aren't using a controller.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game. It's the closest thing a game can get to being a movie without ceasing to be a game, and it's done quite well. The storyline's very well-written and executed, and the graphics are similarly good and styled in just the right way to boost your immersion into the story (most of the time). The controls are solid, the camera generally does its job (except when you're shimmying on top of a narrow ledge) and the puzzles are intuitive.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't flaws. The graphics, being generally good, only ended up killing my immersion on the occasions they weren't; examples include a flock of 2D bats in the glider section and footprints that appeared everywhere but where I was actualy stepping in the snowy area.\n\nSince this is a heavily story-driven game, it's linear and fairly short (still more than twice as long as your average movie, though). If there's a side path, it either joins up with the main path within a short amount of time or exists solely to provide an achievement. It's usually pretty obvious what you're supposed to do, so there isn't a whole lot of challenge to the game; if you're the kind of gamer who can't stand games that don't kill you for breathing too hard, I wouldn't pick this game up.\n\nThe few times it isn't clear what you need to do end up extremely grating by contrast; two of these particularly got on my nerves. First, there's a glider segment where your glider gets torn apart , and aiming at the nearest landmass ends up getting you killed and makes you do the entire (2 minute) glider section all over again. Second, near the end of the game there's a segment where you have to get Little Bro (who can't swim) across a body of water while Big Bro isn't close enough to help; to find the solution, you literally have to mash buttons.\n\nI also encountered several glitches, many of which forced me to restart from a checkpoint; feel free to check out my screenshot gallery for examples. (And one spoiler, though it's properly tagged.) Fortunately, they didn't happen more than once per location, and were very infrequent.\n\nDespite these flaws, I found that the game was enjoyable and worth its $5 price tag, especially since I approached the game from the perspective of it being an interactive movie.","December 28, 2013","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It’s a coming of age tale, it’s about bonds and friendship and loss, it is a modern Ico, conceptually simple yet beautifully crafted.\n\nYou control two brothers simultaneously, each half of the controller moving one of the siblings. Interaction with the world is simple, there’s only one interaction button for each boy and there are no menus or magic or combat. Controlling each individual character is simple, but coordinating their actions in order to transverse their world is somewhat akin to trying to pat your head while rubbing your stomach.\n\nThat’s not to say the game is difficult. While there are puzzles to solve, there’s little in the way of real challenge. But the game isn’t about that, it’s not about getting a high score or finding collectable items. It’s a story waiting to be told and every interaction tells part of the story.\n\nThe game is essentially wordless, with a simlish like language used. Instead the story is told through the animation. As the two brothers interact with the same object their personality comes through, the care free nature of the youngest brother and the older one trying to be strong and responsible while still being a teenager.\n\nThe game is only a couple of hours longs, but it’s very lean and takes you on quite a journey in in that time. It’s also a remarkably pretty game with a lovely soundtrack. There’s plenty more that can be told about Brothers but it’s really a game that deserves to be experienced.\n","January 1, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And now they are faced with a new\nalarming situation, their father is ill and will soon die.\n\nThe two brothers sets out on a adventure to recover\na magic three juice that will save their father.\n\n---REVIEW---\n\nTo start of, this is one of the prettiest indie games\nI have ever played. The graphics and art design is\nreally outstanding, and I found myself stopping up\nfor a brief period of time to just look at the\nscenery. Some of the scenery just left me in awe,\nit's a really unique world and the graphical style\nfrom the landscape to the creatures in this game\nis really wonderful.\n\nThe world in this game is truly stunning.\n\nThe audio is also getting a huge thumbs up from me.\nA huge variety of fantastic sound effects and a\nsoundtrack which really fits inn with the situations\nyou encounter in this game and the world we're\ntaking part of.\n\nThe gameplay is special, creative and fun. I will note tho,\nthat a game controller IS required to play this game, and I\nwill explain why. In this game you control both of the two\nbrothers at the same time, the way they did this was dedicating\none of the two analog sticks to each of the brothers and one\nshoulder button to each of the brothers. With the left analog stick\nand shoulder button you control the eldest brother, and with the\nright analog stick and shoulder button you control the youngest.\n\nThis is a really fun and creative way to do this, and often brings\norientation difficulty during some situations. When the two brothers\ncross over to the opposite side of the screen from each other,\nthe control sheme stays the same, so the controls in a way\nbecomes inverted. It's a fun challenge and I found myself\nduring some situations just stopping up to get my orientation stright.\n\nThe game combines this special control aspect of the game with\nsome intriguing puzzles, which will require some multitasking.\nNone of the puzzles is especially hard to do, but they were fun\nand creative. Tho because the game developers went for the choise\nof giving this world an imaginary language, and not specially\nmuch written text at all, there were a few situations I was lost\nas of what I was supposed to do, but not for long.\n\nAs for the story in this game, it's really good. You'll get immersed\nin this world and continue adventuring to try finding a cure for\nyour dying father. You'll encounter some really dark situations in\nthis game, dark emotional situations, some of the situations\nyou encounter might get to you and make you just think over\nwhat just happened. It's not a tale of happy rainbows and chocolate,\nit's a mature journey which will bring up subjects like death, suicide\nand the strong bond between two brothers.\n\nI spent approximately 3.1 hours completing this game, so it's not\nespecially long, and because this game really doesn't\nbring much replay-value into it, I find the price tag of 14€ to\nbe a tiny bit too much, to be honest. But, this is an exceptionally\nbeautiful and mature tale of two brothers, in one of the prettiest\ngame worlds I've seen, so the 14€'s was worth it.\n\n---SCORE---\n\nI will pull some points off from "Value", because of short game time\nand little to none replay-value.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nAudio: 9.0/10\nGameplay: 9.0/10\nStory: 9.0/10\nValue: 7.0/10\n\nScore: 8.7/10","April 10, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons keeps the narrative-driven gaming trend going this year with relateable interactions and development in an unforgettable journey.\n\nThe game starts off showing a flashback of the mother of the two sons' death. Whilst reminiscing on that tragic day, the two brothers' father falls ill. After a trip to the local doctor, the brothers are told about the water from the 'tree of life' which appears to be the only way to save their dad, and so their quest begins.\n\nRight off the bat the visuals are phenomenal, making use of the Unreal Engine 3. Vibrant colors shown in various settings such as forests, mountains, dungeons, and small towns, nice cell-shading style, detailed shadows...for an indie-style game, it actually looks on par or even better than some AAA titles. To top it off, the soundtrack sets the tone and brings the world to life, immerseful and always in the back of your mind whilst playing (see video at the top to get an idea).\n\nThe controls are unlike any I've played before it. You control two characters simultaneously, and whilst there's very few controls to use (movement for either side of analogs, and one button interaction for each brother), how they integrated and executed the controls is brilliant. It takes some getting used to, and you'd tend to forget a finger on a button here or there whilst trying to keep the brothers on track with their mission, but the game isn't punishing. It's simplistic and overall not too difficult to play. The two brothers rely on one another to move forward, both having significant differences to get through various puzzles. However, playing with a keyboard can prove to be frustrating. Definitely recommend a controller (even the Steam page claims it requires a controller to play, although keyboard controls are available).\n\nThere is never a dull moment in this game. The pacing is perfect. For such simple mechanics with the unique twist of controlling two characters at once, each segment, or well, chapter, is different and utilizes the innovative controls in a variety of ways. And the best part about the pacing is, and this is a debatable point, the simple puzzles keep the game from detouring and ruining its experience.\n\nWhilst the gameplay and graphics are integral, very fun parts of the game, what outshines more than anything, what brings all the elements together and shapes it into an extraordinary game, is the growth of the brothers. They have to go through hell and high water in order to save their father, and like any group of siblings stuck together for so long, there's going to be rivalry. Their age and clothing show their typical, rather cliche attitudes well, and we need that to piece their styles together as there's no English in this game. There's voice-acting, but done in a fake language allowing us to detail the characters on our own. The brothers encounter various people and things to interact with, with both reacting their on way to any given situation, further drawing their different personalities to us.\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons is an emotional ride. It doesn't just stop with the engaging, roller coaster of a story, it is a well-rounded game with fun controls and beautiful graphics to follow suit. It shows us very, very strong bonds as children, as siblings, as a family...life lessons secretly hidden in this title. This, along with Gone Home, have really set a new mark in gaming today, pushing forward for the better of the industry. And now...I urge anyone who stuck around reading this to try it. We need more games like Brothers. These titles are taking risks and evolving the gaming industry, or have the possibility to, so long as they get more exposure. And even without talking about it, the experience itself is worth the price of admission. A general $15 full retail price for a 3-4 hour game, but there's constant sales and even if you don't catch it during a sale it's still very much worth it. Couldn't recommend Brothers enough. Thank you for reading.","December 8, 2013","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's not that much of a plot actually and as there is neither any on-screen text, nor any spoken language other than the unintelligible fantasy language the characters are using every now and then, the main focus clearly is the emotional impact rather than the actual plot. This is working great, though.\n\nThis cannot unconditionally be said about the controls, however. Controlling two characters at once with an actually very basic setup (using one analogue stick and one trigger per character, plus two buttons for camera control) is an interesting concept and nicely supports the narrative in certain ways, but it's really easy to get confused, especially in sections demanding that both brothers are simultaneously moved more or less precisely. You can certainly get used to it, but it might take a while and the game might actually already be over at that point ;)\n\nYou can easily plow through the game in three hours or probably even less. There's some replay value because of several optional parts - in fact, all of the game's achievements are completely optional. Then again, not each achievement is unlocked by an additional puzzle of some sorts, but sometimes simply by interacting with the right object long enough. The puzzles in general might be a bit too easy and for the most part they rather test your patience than your logical thinking. Pretty much all of them make great sense in the context of the journey, though - there's no tacked-on riddle solving that feels out of place.\n\nAll in all this game does indeed deserve the praise it's been getting ever since its release, and it is very easy to ignore the lack of challenge and the basic nature of the plot as it still delivers some satisfying gameplay and an emotionally impactful and visually beautiful experience.\n\nFor comparable titles, see Journey (PS3), Papo y Yo, and maybe Limbo.","February 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The environments were all really beautiful and interesting and the way you move through them was surprising throughout.\n\nI wasn't as emotionally invested as some people seem to have been, but the story works nonetheless and the controls and environments were enough to leave me with a very positive impression of the game. The game becomes increasingly surreal as you progress through it, and it made the world this takes place in really interesting. I would absolutely love to get more background information about some of the things I saw in the game.\n\nThe great thing is that the game doesn't tell you anything through text or dialogue. The dialogue that's there is all in a made-up language, and there's nothing to read. Instead, the game SHOWS everything and it does a very good job at that. Everything is clear enough to get from A to B and solve the puzzles without many problems, but vague enough to remain mysterious.\n\nThe controls are also a pretty good point about the game. A controller is basically a must. Each brother is controlled by one of the analogue sticks, and each has an interact-button. You control both brothers at the same time, and... it just works really well. All the puzzles are easy enough to grasp within a few seconds but still require some finesse to get right. Even so, the game isn't really about the puzzles so much as about the story and the two brothers from the title.\n\nThe game takes about 3 hours to complete, perhaps a bit longer if you try to get all the achievements, which are basically just tiny extra bits of story that can be really good in their own right.\n\nI would definitely recommend this. It's not a game you can sink countless hours in, but it's definitely worth the trouble of picking up and playing through at least once.","February 14","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Throughout the entirety of the game they harass villagers, break ♥♥♥♥, steal livestock, steal vehicles, PURPOSELY MURDER creatures, DESECRATE the dead, and BATHE IN BLOOD just so they can save their father; how is ANYONE supposed to end up liking these main characters?\n\nTwo, I can't see why this game is held by a lot of people to be more artistic than any other regular game out there. Sure the game looks nice, but just because a game looks pretty and plays differently than other games DOESN'T make it any better artistically, and I think the games price (about fifiteen dollars) is a tad steep for the game you get. And honestly, the game's premise is very generic. The story is basically "father falls ill, sons go on a quest to find medicine to cure it" and that formula goes pretty much how you would expect it to. Even though the game does take a lot of twists and turns, the ending ends up being very predictable, and the game fails to try and make you care for the brothers other than with its cheap gimmick of controlling both brothers at once.\n\n\nOverall I'd recommend buying this game if you like platformers or like these sort of "fancy" storytelling games, no offense towards those types of games and the people who like them (I am one of them), but acknowledge them for what they are and don't think just because these games have a different style than most other games they're somehow "great art".\n\n\n\nEDIT: Playing this game with the keyboard is fine, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.","July 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The story is rich and includes a few puzzles too. The main idea of the story shortly - two boys who have already struggled with the loss of their mother, and are now faced with the reality of a sick and dying father, must save him by retrieving "The Water of Life". And so their journey begins.\n\nThe story is excellent, it immerses you into the world immediately. I've experienced a lot of different emotions - happiness, fear, wanderlust, compassion and grief. The game successfully tells a consistent, intelligible, fulfilling and mature story without the characters saying single word which you could understand because if I'm not mistaken it's in Finnish (which confused me at the beginning, to be honest), but it entirely relies on pure interactive game-play. That genuinely leaves a deep emotional impression on the player.\n\nThe world is elaborate, charming and spirited, and despite its story being only ~4 hours long, it takes you through a lot  of various environments, every chapter feels fresh, captivating and interesting. There also can be found some mini side-quests that reward you with achievements and extra contents. It would be a sin if I don't mention the brilliance of the soundtracks -  truly atmospheric and moving.\n\nYou control two individual characters at the same time (the brothers) to solve interesting, varied puzzles in order to progress through the level. Even if it's told that the game is supposed to be single-player, I think that it can be an amazing local co-op too. Playing by myself was unique expierience I have never had before because simultaneously controlling two characters can be quite challenging sometimes. There's a notice that game requires a controller to play - I played with keyboard (wasd, space bar, ctrl and arrows) and I hadn't any problems with that.\n\n“Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons” is truly fascinating game. It had captured my heart. This is one journey you will never forget.\nTo be honest, the ending has broken my heart. But it was worth it and I'll definetly play this game again.\n\n"One must be strong where the other is weak, brave where the other is fearful, they must be...

But don't be afraid to read any further, no spoilers here.\n\nBrothers is a pinnacle of game design. It's a perfect combination of narrative, gameplay mechanics that just "work", and beautiful design both in level design as in general art style. There were numerous moments where I was just blown away by the beauty of this game. It's something you don't expect in the beginning when you see the Unreal Engine logo.\n\nThey make up for the low polygon count of the characters by beautiful textures, great lighting effects and the best camera positioning you have ever seen.\n\nTL;DR:\nShort but oh oh oh so sweet.

While this is a pretty average story, it is presented with so much strength and emotion that it is really hard not to get touched by it. Even more so due the fact that there is no 'real' voice acting in the game apart from bits and pieces in a made-up language, so every bit of feeling and emotion the game tries to convey is is entirely transported through the fantastic soundtrack, the level design and the character acting.\n\nAlthough the game is based on the PC-friendly Unreal Engine, it doesn't really provide many graphics options aside from brightness, resolution and VSync, but that shouldn't hold you off because the game looks absolutely stunning regardless.\n\nThe level design is fairly linear, so there is usually just one path to get from A to B, but the varying enviroments are packed with so much detail and love that it is a real pleasure to the eye to just wander around and explore all the tiny details Starbreeze has left in the game, such as a squirrel climbing a tree or bunnies hopping around. You can also sit down on any of the various benches in the levels to get a scenic view of some special spots. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nAn innovation that I haven't seen in any other game yet are the gameplay mechanics as you control both brothers at once, each brother with one thumb stick on your control, so it's basically like playing a two-player co-op game - but alone. This feels extremely weird at first and will definitely put your coordination and multitasking skills to the test, but the further you get into the game the more you get used to it.\n\nThe puzzles in the game make use of this mechanic in various ways and while the puzzle solutions as such generally are fairly obvious, solving them by controlling both brothers at once provides the actual challenge.\n\nPSA: Despite the fact that the store page mentions 'Notice: Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons requires a controller to play', the game can be played with a keyboard just fine and the launcher also lets you rebind the keys (by default you control one brother with WASD and the other one with the arrow keys). I definitely recommend playing the game with a controller, though, as this simply feels better with a game like this.\n\nWith roughly 3.5 to 4 hours the game isn't exceptionally long by most people's standard, but it has so much depth and emotion that I consider it worth it every single cent if it manages to leave me with both sadness and satisfaction upon finishing it. If I had known what a strong game this is, I wouldn't have hesitated to pre-order it.\n\nBrothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a shiny gem among the games released this year and needs all the attention it can get. Especially these days where games rarely tell such an emotional story - or any story at all.","October 31, 2013","true","3.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are two characters but you have to control both of them yourself, simultaneously.  Because of this, the game makes for a serious exercise in multitasking and coordination.  It also makes a gamepad almost a necessity, though I believe the game does have keyboard controls as well.\n\nThe game plays like an adventure game, following a linear path and solving simple puzzles by having the two brothers work together.  The older, taller, stronger brother is needed for some tasks while the younger, smaller brother is needed for others.  It's a very different experience controlling both characters yourself vs a traditional coop game and I believe it was designed this way to give more impact to the story.\n\nThe story is told silently with no words spoken or written, though characters will speak in a sort of gibberish when interacting.    Any information they provide to the player is given through gestures, indicating where you should proceed to next.  This is generally unnecessary though since the game is very linear.  The story is very moving and is a very strong point for the game.\n\nBrothers has some fantastic scenery and provides benches you can use to view scenic points, though the texture quality is very low and this low quality is quite visible in some areas.  As has been shown in other games though, art design is much more important and helps make up for this lack of texture quality.\n\nMy overall assessment is that Brothers is a great game, though I find it a bit over-hyped.  People talk about it like it's a new revolution in gaming but it is simply a great game, though short.","February 19, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's got a fantastictly designed and living world that makes for wonderful exploration.\n\nHowever, the gameplay isn't nearly as good... The "single player co-op" is certainly an innovative design choice, but as it turns out it's a nightmare from controlls perspective. It's confusing and bothersome to controll both characters at the same time... I guess they made the puzzles super easy to make up for that, but really, I think a challenge would have been welcome now and again at least.\n\nAnd for such a linear experience, there's quite a few bugs all arround. Nothing game breaking, but stuff that might force you to restart the chapter...\n\nSo bottom line, as a visual and narrative experience, Brothers is FANTASTIC! But as a puzzle/adventure game... There are many, many other games that do that better and will last you longer than 3 hours.","September 26, 2014","true","3.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Do it now.\nTraditional rating - 98/100\n\nI'm going to get this out of the way up front: In my opinion, this is hands-down the best game from 2013, and one of the best games I have ever played. Stop reading this and go play it right now.\n\nI will try my absolute hardest not to give anything away, but as with other story-based games, 99.99% of the enjoyment is in the journey, and having absolutely no idea what to expect next. I BEG you to just take my word on faith and go play it before you read or watch anything else about it. I mean it. Right now. Set aside 3 hours, close your door, put on some headphones or turn the volume up, and enjoy the ride.\n\nIf you're still reading, then here is what I thought: Never before have I seen a game so flawlessly accomplish every single thing it sets out to do. The control scheme works perfectly, the graphics are breathtaking, the story brought tears to my eyes, and the puzzles were just the right amount of tricky. The pacing of the game is definitely on the slow side, but just remember, the game is called "A Tale of Two Sons." It's telling you a story, and boy what a story it is.\n\nIt starts off with the younger brother (named Naiee) kneeling at his mother's grave, and then immediately cuts to a flashback where the mother is drowning in a lake, but Naiee is not strong enough to pull her into the boat. We see her slip beneath the surface, and fade into the darkness. Back in the present, the mother's spirit appears to Naiee and comforts him with a kiss, vanishing into thin air just as he reaches out to her. The peace of the moment is broken by Naiee's brother Nyaa calling for help. Turns out their father has come down with a serious illness, and it is up to the brothers to bring him to the doctor, and ultimately trek across a gorgeous, fantastical world straight out of a Grimm fairy tale.\n\nThis of course is where you, the player, step in. It is up to you to control both brothers at the same time, controlling their movements with one analog stick each, and making them interact with things by pressing and holding the trigger buttons. That's it, no jump, no inventory, no flashlight, no skills, no nothing. If you groaned when you read that, I completely understand. When I first heard about the control scheme and basic premise, I was immensely skeptical as well, but it is astounding how well everything works. This is essentially a single-player co-op game, and it just might be the most intuitive control schemes I have ever seen in a game.\n\nThe true cleverness of the controls goes much deeper than just giving you the ability to solve 2-person puzzles by yourself though. The real beauty of the control scheme is that as the two brothers are adventuring and exploring, you are quite literally the glue holding them together. You are pulled into this story world and tasked with being the relationship between the brothers. I didn't really put words to it until the game was over, but it is an unbelievably powerful gameplay mechanic, and it plays a monumental part in how involved you are with the story. Plus, it is used later on in the game in arguably one of the most meaningful and touching ways I have ever seen in any storytelling medium, let alone video games.\n\nI am not at all ashamed to admit that this game made me cry, more than once, and for extended periods. No game has ever done that to me before. This is a monumentally important thing, and what it says to me is that video games can be art every single bit as much as any movie, book, painting, sculpture, or live performance. This is not just one of the most emotionally powerful video games I've ever experienced, it is one of the most emotionally powerful THINGS I have ever experienced.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that there is no understandable spoken dialog in the game at all. The characters speak a completely made-up language, and while the structure of the language itself is familiar, you will never know exactly what's being said. You can always understand based on context and body language, though. This is far from the first game to ever employ such a tactic, but it is pulled off so well throughout the entire game that there was never a spoken moment where I didn't fully understand what was going on.\n\nIt may seem like I'm gushing, but I'm really not. There are certainly a few things wrong with the game. For instance, other than a few little distractions and side-achievements, it is completely linear, so there is no replayability, and $15 for 3 hours of gameplay might seem expensive to some (it is worth every single penny). Also, sometimes it hurt my brain trying to control both brothers, but the game does a very good job of always lining them up to match the analog sticks. Nyaa is the left stick and is kept on the left side, and Naiee is the right stick and is kept on the right side. I found it instinctually easier to keep them that way the entire game anyway, so I hardly noticed the game's insistence on placing them that way during cutscene moments.\n\nThe only REAL complaint I have about the game is that some of the puzzles have tricky timing. There are some puzzles where you're holding R2 to grip onto a ledge and you have to point the analog stick in a direction, release R2 to launch, and then press R2 again to grip the new surface. It is very easy to mess up those R2 presses. I found it much easier to immediately re-press R2 after releasing, and the brother in question would simply grab the new surface as he came up to it.\n\nThe puzzles in general are very pleasant, feel very organic, and are all very satisfying. The solutions were not immediately apparent for many of them, but it never took very long before things started to click. New elements and ways of solving puzzles are slowly introduced along the way as well, so they do get fairly complex near the end of the game. Thankfully, even if you are stuck on a puzzle, the environments never open up TOO much, so you don't have to scour through a mansion looking for a switch or lever. The solution is always close, and always clever. In fact, there is one section in particular where the brothers are attached by a rope that had me smiling and laughing out loud.\n\nThat right there hits home on why this game is so important. Sad stories are easy. Funny stories are easy. What is NOT easy however, and what the greatest stories of all time have been able to hone in on, is the whole range of emotions. The rollercoaster, if you will. Throughout the course of this game I felt everything. I was sad, then hopeful, then annoyed, then happy, then cautious, then in awe, then nervous, then freaked-out, then disgusted, then horrified, then laughing, then heart-broken, and then hopeful again.\n\nI can not stress enough how badly everyone needs to play this game. The graphics are gorgeous and fit the fairy-tale style perfectly, the music is touching and evocative, the controls are perhaps the most cleverly-done thing I've ever seen in a video game, and the story will pluck at your heartstrings even if you thought you didn't have any. Most so-called "emotional" games are very ham-fisted. They show you things and tell you how you should feel. This game is very subtle. It is never forceful and it is never pandering. I'm even hesitant to say that the game tells you a story or shows you things. The story is just there. Things are just there. YOU are just there, holding hands with the brothers, experiencing everything.\n\nIt is weird, it is harrowing, it is beautiful, and it is so perfectly put together that I'm going to beat myself up later for not giving it a 100. I'm pretty harsh on most games, but I honestly can not think of even one significant improvement that could be done.\n\nI really could go on for 10 more pages about why I'll remember this game on my death bed, but all that really needs to be said is that I got it free with PS+, and then gladly paid full price for it.","March 11, 2014","true","0.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","5"

However, after playing through, I'm a bit disappointed. The gameplay was repetitive and most of the puzzles were obvious.

Not just gameplay, beautiful graphics nor the story/characters. Everything.\n\nIf you're into these "art'sy" type of games where the exploration and atmosphere comes first, you'll probably love it. But if you find them dull and too sappy for your tastes, stay away. It's not exactly challenging, but I wasn't really looking for a challenge in the first place.

A game has to be REALLY REALLY good to be that short and still hold a reccomendation from me at a market price of 15 dollars, but yet here I am, with two thumbs up for this artistic masterpiece of a game. From a gameplay standpoint, Brothers is quite simple at the basic level - no puzzles were too advanced and the platforming is simple and doesn't require any button presses. Where the golden mechanic lies is the fact that you control the brothers simultaneously, a feat achieved by assigning a brother to one stick of a joypad (which is mandatory for play). While disorienting at first, eventually you pick up the pace and find it an enjoyable and innovative mechanic to work cooperatively with... yourself. Very ingenious.\n\nBut where the game lacks in length and puzzles, it REEAAAALLLY picks up in atmosphere, visuals, and story. To begin, the story is just that two sons are finding a liquid that will restore their sick dad's health, by following a map. Yeah, not much there, but it's interesting in that the entire story is conveyed without a single line of dialouge, but rather with hand gestures and the context of the envrionment. What I find best about the atmosphere is that it is beautiful, one of the most beautiful platofrmers since Trine 2 (which I found really enticing). I found myself staring at the villages, dark forests, snowy mountaintops, and rainy rivers simply for their aesthetic value, not really for their gameplay. The atmosphere is only further enhanced by a somber and dramatic soundtrack, which always accomponies the narrative in a guiding way and really caps off the sad ending.\n\nOverall, I'd recomend it if you are in the mood for a short but magnificently beautiful work of art, perhaps one of the most mature video games on the market as we speak.","June 30, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rollig/recommended/225080/","rollig","rolig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rollig/","296 products in account","Perfect game.\n\nI enjoyed every minute of this. I was drawn into the world and the story completely while I played. I felt like I was on an epic adventure, and I was truly invested into the 3 main characters. Now that I'm finished I can appreciate things in finer detail.\n\nGameplay is certainly unique, but that's not the main take-away here. I think -everything- comes together to make a truly memorable experience.\n\nThe unique gameplay mechanic (driving both brothers with one controller) is certainly notable and memorable by itself, and something else will use this mechanic in the future and I'll think of this game. But that doesn't give the full picture. The atmosphere created by the design and the music and the story all- is a new benchmark for me. I'm sure I'll think of it often.\n\nYou can run through this world, taking the shortest path to your goal, and enjoy yourself thoroughly I think. But you don't have to. Despite the epic adventure vibe, you're not at all rushed, and you can stop to smell the roses of this wonderful environment (and you get an achievement for doing so). There are other characters in the world that you pass in your travels, and you can often play some part in their lives. Looking at the achievments screen now that I'm done reveals that I missed some of this myself, but I don't feel like I missed anything really.\n\nI was emotionally spent after completing this game. I took a lot from the experience and that might stick with me longest. As an experience, I think it rates with the best movies I've ever seen. I don't usually get this quality from games, and that probably intensified it for me, but it's excellent to be sure. I took some minutes to bask in it after I was done.\n\nIt's not a difficult game, although the very first time you come across a new puzzle aspect (particularly at the start of the game) you will be confused until you get it, I think that as a whole, that aspect was good for the game. It doesn't take long to pick up really.\n\nFind some quiet hours and throw yourself into this game completely and you ought to get twice as much out of it.","December 27, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A game that creates an innovative, entertaining yet intuitive control system is rare. A game that creates a consistent deeply moving emotional experience in its players is rare. A game that does both? Epic.\n\nI will not go in depth into the detailed mechanics or the story itself because doing so would ruin your individual experience. I am not referring only to story spoilers, but your experience and growth in using the "single-player co-op" control system. Don't watch a video. Don't read commentary. I started playing this game on a whim in my office when my family was asleep. Speakers on low, door open, lights on, email up on my second monitor. 30 minutes into the game I had headphones on, door was closed, lights and second monitor turned off. It commanded a degree of attention and immersion that I have rarely experienced. Buy it now and play it. I give it an 11/10. No kidding.\n\nIn fact, you owe it to yourself to play this game.

It's a tale where you take a part of it. Take the time to stop by at some of the bench you're going to pass through during the game. That will let you admire the very well done scenery.\nIn the same time, let you invite by the poetry of the music, in every matter, the soundtrack is not just a music, but really a full part of the game. And in the same idea, the language used in the game is as poetic as the rest, so it’s mostly your imagination which will make the scripts ;o).\n\nOh, also, take note that even if Steam (and the developer of the game) tell you that this game require a gamepad, it’s playable with a keyboard. You have to practice and from time to time it's not as perfect as it could be with the gamepad's joysticks but that work.\n\nWell, it's worth the full price asked (and in my humble opinion is still cheap even if it's not a long game - about 3 hours) and I think it's a nice pause to take.\n\n---------------------\n\nComme la plupart des évaluations présentent ici et là l'ont déjà fait remarquer, c'est un des jeux les plus divertissants et beaux dans son type. C’est un conte dans lequel vous êtes entrainé. Prenez le temps de vous arrêter au niveau des bancs que vous allez rencontrer durant le jeu. Cela vous permettra d’admirer les très beaux points de vue, particulièrement bien fait.\nDans le même temps, laissez-vous entrainer par la poésie de la musique, car à tout point de vue, ce n’est pas juste de la musique mais réellement une partie intrinsèque du jeu. Et dans la même idée, le langage utilisé dans le jeu est aussi poétique que le reste, c’est donc votre imagination qui fait le script/les dialogues ;o)\n\nOh, et aussi, prenez note que même si Steam (et le développeur du jeu) indique qu’une manette est nécessaire pour jouer, c’est tout à fait jouable au clavier. Alors cela demande de la pratique et de temps en temps ce n’est pas aussi parfait que cela pourrait l’être avec les joysticks d’une manette, mais cela marche.\n\nEn tout cas, cela vaut le prix demandé (et selon mon humble avis cela ne reste pas cher payé même si ce n’est pas un jeu très long – environ 3 heures) et je pense que c’est une belle pause à prendre.","December 9, 2013","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And lack thereof. He prefers silent films for this reason: visual storytelling should not rely on sound to create the story. Sound should be a suppliment to that story, not a crutch. And, when done right, the right sound effects in the right place can drastically heighten emotional impact.\n\nGood sound design is one of those things that often goes unnoticed in film and game critique. And Brothers has good sound design.\n\nThe lack of understandable dialogue actually makes the story better because it forces us to discern the story from simple action alone. Oftentimes I found myself rationalizing the actions of the brothers and other NPCs by determining their emotions from their actions. Such as the crying forest giant- context allowed me to discern that someone he loved was gone. That was just one example of many I found myself thinking as I played the game. Don't give your audience 4: give them 2+2. Let them figure it out. That's why this game doesn't need dialogue.\n\nThe music only has a discernable melody and composition when in emotionally intense situations. Otherwise, it is atmospheric, indecipherable sounds. This is effective because if a musician relies too much on bombarding our senses with fantastic melodies at all times, we will not be able to appreciate a moment when it truly calls for some riveting emotions. So, when you're just wandering the land, accomplishing small tasks, the music remains quiet, pensive, and ambient. When something big is going on... it's spine-chilling. Contrast is everything!\n\nThe sound effects are immersive because they draw from the environment, and you can often hear things coming before you see them. This is effective because when you are traveling around in real life, out in the woods or even on city streets, oftentimes you will hear things before you see them coming. This is something we have tended to take for granted, but you can tell this was intentionally designed in the game.\n\nOf course, the art direction was gorgeous. I especially love the fact that the characters are not rendered in an attempt for photorealism like many triple A titles these days. You simply don't need that. Stylized, abstracted forms are more pleasing to the eye IMO. Attempting photorealistic characters in a video game is just too uncanny valley for my tastes.\n\nThe *colors*, man. The light and shadows. The composition. It's a visual masterpiece.\n\nAnd the ending. I don't have to explain why it's so chilling and amazing.\n\nWhat are you waiting for... buy this game!","February 26, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The journey that started in a quintessential village quickly gave way to the fantastical; each new area tells a story of its own through its presentation and together they are woven into the lore of this new world to explore.\n\nNot approaching the game as a puzzle or adventure game greatly enhances the experience. It felt more akin to an 3 hour epic. While it has some minor issues that I can’t mention without spoiling the game, I enjoyed the game overall and would highly recommend it. The last 30 minutes is when the magic happens.\n\nPS: play with a gamepad","February 22, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After seeing Totalbiscuit and [AReV]BavarianGod and having them already pointing out their arguments in their respected videos, I wondered if any review would be adding any additional insight. So after some thinking, I thought: lets discuss what the game did for me.\n\nTo me, the game was a joyous experience, with a twist. Due to the tone of the game being about hefty themes like love, companionship and fear. The hefty themes suggest that the game wants to have those themes be taken very seriously, and for me it did, though not in the extend it happened to the previous mentioned people.\n\nOne note should go to my favorite (and often overlooked) part of a game is sound: Though it forgoes the use of speech, Brothers does a damn fine job to fill up this gap by using gibberish talks, hand and feet communication and an awesome soundtrack (which you should buy btw) to provide the wholesale immersion.\n\nThis game felt like a game again, not someone who has set some knobs regarding which few game mechanics should be in a game, press 'create' and voila: a triple-a title.\nNo, this game seperates itself from that, in which it succeeds really well: its gameplay really let you immerse into the world, even though you're not seeing it from a first person view.\n\nAll in all, I think that this game is for people who dare step off their beloved franchise game, try a single game and find this one.\n\nUps:\n+ Good Narritive\n+ Heartfelt Story\n+ Unique Game mechanics\n+ SOUND!\n+ MUSIC!\n\nDowns:\n- Short Story\n- Difficulty","June 24, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The inital awkwardness of the controls is made easy by the activities that you do with the mechanics. The game isn't so much about difficult challenges as it is about the emotional weight of each of your actions. Every ten minutes, I felt like the two player mechanic was being utilized in a new and unique way, and there are even some thematic callbacks to certain gameplay portions that blew my mind.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDPoZ/recommended/225080/","JDPoZ","JDPoZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDPoZ/","200 products in account","An incredibly powerful short story about 2 brothers on a quest through a dangerous and fantastic land to find a magic water with healing powers that can save their dying father.\n\nThe mechanics play just as big a part in the story as the story itself.\nThe design is nothing short of masterful. Every new puzzle is simple yet never easy and always rewarding to complete. Challenges are explained without the use of specific audio or textual direction; only pantomime and vocal tones without the use of a dechiperable language. I do think I knew the brothers' names by the end of the story, only because throughout the game each brother calls out to the other ever so often, each always repeating a specific word (similar to how you as a player come to grasp the name of the hero's horse in Shadow of the Colossus). Every dangerous situation with a new puzzle mechanic had always already been taught to the player in a safe sandbox area so that they are always prepared for when a situation called to re-use that mechanic in an unsafe part of the world. Never was anything similar to what you might call a "modern tutorial" was ever needed.\n\nOne particular moment near the end of the game must be recognized. In this moment, the designers pull off one of the most amazing feats of creative direction I've ever seen. There is a very specific set of challenges with an ostensibly new mechanic that is not explicitly explained in the ways most of the previous ones have been... but the designers know from your experiences in the game, you will naturally try to solve it in a very specific way. To "count on" a player to not only figure something like this out but to also grasp WHY they made this decision usually is a bad idea or requires a tutorial or some sort of cookie to let you know why some choice was made, but in this specific instance, the magic moment you understand what was trying to be done would have been shattered if you were not given the chance to figure it out yourself.\n\nThis might sound a bit confusing, but that moment, even if you aren't worried about spoilers, is indeed a hard moment to explain. I hate to refer to a specific trope often used for hyperbole, but the only comparison I can think of in a similar medium is that of trying to explain what "The Matrix" is. No one can show you what it is, you just have to see and experience it for yourself to understand it. That near-end game scene in Brothers is like that. Someone explaining it to you won't impact you the same as experiencing it.\n\nTo those planning on playing this masterpiece, do NOT read anything about this game's story or watch any playthroughs. The game will always challenge you to think, but will never prove frustrating. And the best part of it is discovering the answers to the questions it asks you on your own. Looking up anything on it will surely lessen your experience. The achievements should be discovered and completed naturally as you play. I recommend holding off trying to follow any walkthroughs or guides in an effort to conquer every single one of the game's hidden side quests until after you complete the game at least once.\n\nSpeaking as someone who has an older half-brother, and a younger brother, if you have any siblings, you need to play this. You will be moved beyond words.\n\nOh, and buyers who tend to collect and not play, don't let this sit on your "wall of shame" either. It's really short. Only about 3 hours to complete. Set aside a few hours and do it all in 1 or 2 sittings. It is an important game that marks a point in gaming history when designers were able to evoke a feeling in a way that no other medium could do. Other designers will be talking about and trying to understand and mimic this perfect execution of this moment for years to come.\n\nIf this still isn't enough to convince you to buy the game, then listen to a much bigger game critic celebrity, TotalBiscuit, call the game "the best game I've ever played in 25 years."\nhttp://youtu.be/lz3EmqraAxc","November 3, 2013","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Somehow, Brothers delivers an emotional, compassionate story, without a single word of dialogue in the whole game. Charcaters do speak, but their language is Simmilar to Simlish (The Sims) I suppose. Although you cannot understand the language, You will still understand what is going on. You will have to prepare yourself for many emotions throughout the game. I will list a few I've experienced: Sadness, joy, wonder, curiousity, horror, excitement, and despair. Sounds a bit over the top? Well go see for yourself. You may experience emotions you never new existed.\n\nBrothers perfectly marries Story with Game Mechanics. The best way i can explain it is that you play the story. Again, for lack of a better term, Brothers is a Singleplayer Co-op game. If you were not aware, You control two Brothers independently using the joysicks of your controller (Provided you use a controller). Contrary to the Notice above, The game will work with a keyboard, But I would not recommend it. Seperately controlling the two siblings, you traverse the game working together. I would not classify Brothers as a Puzzle Platformer, however. It's simply a journey. Which brings me to the final point.\n\nBrothers took me roughly 3 hours to complete. I would say there is some replayability, but thats only because there are achievements you will miss and areas you may have skipped. So maybe 5 - 6 hours will be all you get out of Brothers, unless you play through games several times. I know that so few hours may not warrant the price for some people, but I promise you'll remember this game for as long as you live. I know I will.","December 8, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Second, is each brother has a very different personality and you want to see how each react to characters/items. For example, the older brother is mature, strong, and driven. While the younger brother is naughty, afraid of water, and great with animals. The brothers must work together to pass small obstacles.\nMy last favorite thing so far, is there is no guide... no map... and a gibberish language. All you know is you need to find some "tree" to heal your father. This means you need to watch the reactions of other characters and basically touch/look at everything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDPoZ/recommended/225080/","JDPoZ","JDPoZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDPoZ/","200 products in account","An incredibly powerful short story about 2 brothers on a quest through a dangerous and fantastic land to find a magic water with healing powers that can save their dying father.\n\nThe mechanics play just as big a part in the story as the story itself.\nThe design is nothing short of masterful. Every new puzzle is simple yet never easy and always rewarding to complete. Challenges are explained without the use of specific audio or textual direction; only pantomime and vocal tones without the use of a dechiperable language. I do think I knew the brothers' names by the end of the story, only because throughout the game each brother calls out to the other ever so often, each always repeating a specific word (similar to how you as a player come to grasp the name of the hero's horse in Shadow of the Colossus). Every dangerous situation with a new puzzle mechanic had always already been taught to the player in a safe sandbox area so that they are always prepared for when a situation called to re-use that mechanic in an unsafe part of the world. Never was anything similar to what you might call a "modern tutorial" was ever needed.\n\nOne particular moment near the end of the game must be recognized. In this moment, the designers pull off one of the most amazing feats of creative direction I've ever seen. There is a very specific set of challenges with an ostensibly new mechanic that is not explicitly explained in the ways most of the previous ones have been... but the designers know from your experiences in the game, you will naturally try to solve it in a very specific way. To "count on" a player to not only figure something like this out but to also grasp WHY they made this decision usually is a bad idea or requires a tutorial or some sort of cookie to let you know why some choice was made, but in this specific instance, the magic moment you understand what was trying to be done would have been shattered if you were not given the chance to figure it out yourself.\n\nThis might sound a bit confusing, but that moment, even if you aren't worried about spoilers, is indeed a hard moment to explain. I hate to refer to a specific trope often used for hyperbole, but the only comparison I can think of in a similar medium is that of trying to explain what "The Matrix" is. No one can show you what it is, you just have to see and experience it for yourself to understand it. That near-end game scene in Brothers is like that. Someone explaining it to you won't impact you the same as experiencing it.\n\nTo those planning on playing this masterpiece, do NOT read anything about this game's story or watch any playthroughs. The game will always challenge you to think, but will never prove frustrating. And the best part of it is discovering the answers to the questions it asks you on your own. Looking up anything on it will surely lessen your experience. The achievements should be discovered and completed naturally as you play. I recommend holding off trying to follow any walkthroughs or guides in an effort to conquer every single one of the game's hidden side quests until after you complete the game at least once.\n\nSpeaking as someone who has an older half-brother, and a younger brother, if you have any siblings, you need to play this. You will be moved beyond words.\n\nOh, and buyers who tend to collect and not play, don't let this sit on your "wall of shame" either. It's really short. Only about 3 hours to complete. Set aside a few hours and do it all in 1 or 2 sittings. It is an important game that marks a point in gaming history when designers were able to evoke a feeling in a way that no other medium could do. Other designers will be talking about and trying to understand and mimic this perfect execution of this moment for years to come.\n\nIf this still isn't enough to convince you to buy the game, then listen to a much bigger game critic celebrity, TotalBiscuit, call the game "the best game I've ever played in 25 years."\nhttp://youtu.be/lz3EmqraAxc","November 3, 2013","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Somehow, Brothers delivers an emotional, compassionate story, without a single word of dialogue in the whole game. Charcaters do speak, but their language is Simmilar to Simlish (The Sims) I suppose. Although you cannot understand the language, You will still understand what is going on. You will have to prepare yourself for many emotions throughout the game. I will list a few I've experienced: Sadness, joy, wonder, curiousity, horror, excitement, and despair. Sounds a bit over the top? Well go see for yourself. You may experience emotions you never new existed.\n\nBrothers perfectly marries Story with Game Mechanics. The best way i can explain it is that you play the story. Again, for lack of a better term, Brothers is a Singleplayer Co-op game. If you were not aware, You control two Brothers independently using the joysicks of your controller (Provided you use a controller). Contrary to the Notice above, The game will work with a keyboard, But I would not recommend it. Seperately controlling the two siblings, you traverse the game working together. I would not classify Brothers as a Puzzle Platformer, however. It's simply a journey. Which brings me to the final point.\n\nBrothers took me roughly 3 hours to complete. I would say there is some replayability, but thats only because there are achievements you will miss and areas you may have skipped. So maybe 5 - 6 hours will be all you get out of Brothers, unless you play through games several times. I know that so few hours may not warrant the price for some people, but I promise you'll remember this game for as long as you live. I know I will.","December 8, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First off having to use both my right and left hands to control two different characters is a very unique gameplay. Second, is each brother has a very different personality and you want to see how each react to characters/items. For example, the older brother is mature, strong, and driven. While the younger brother is naughty, afraid of water, and great with animals. The brothers must work together to pass small obstacles.\nMy last favorite thing so far, is there is no guide... no map... and a gibberish language. All you know is you need to find some "tree" to heal your father. This means you need to watch the reactions of other characters and basically touch/look at everything. Some characters will be ♥♥♥♥♥ and waste your time, but some with point you in the right direction.

It works best with a controller, but can be played with a keyboard. The gist of it is that you control two brothers simultaneously to solve puzzles and complete action sequences. It gets awfully clever on you, and there are only very minimal cues in the game. That is, it rarely tells you what buttons you need to press. In fact, you've only got the movement controls for each brother and a button to make each of them separately interact with stuff in the environment. There's dialogue but it's audible only in gibberish and only serves to convey character emotion and build on the personalities of the cast. Through the journey you come to know the characters by the quirky way you control them, i.e. you'll probably end up paying more attention to one brother, while the other larks off in some other direction (keeping track of two characters at once is deceptively difficult.)\n\nIt's only a few hours long, but the price is right. It's almost criminal that during the last steam sale I was able to get it for something like $2.50. Normal price $15, it's actually on sale for $7.50 right now.

It features similarly well-designed puzzles that utilize an impressively intuitive control scheme as you run through a world that manages to tell a completely wordless story.\n\nI haven’t tried to play this game with a keyboard but I probably wouldn’t recommended it. On a 360 pad you control each brother with one analog stick, and each trigger serves as an “interact” button for each of them. Through this, Brothers puts you through what is every bit the classic adventure game in the Ico, Another World, and Prince of Persia tradition.\n\nEach brother has different abilities -- the older brother is stronger and can swim but the younger brother can fit in smaller places. Through this, Brothers manages to give you puzzles that are surprisingly ingenious despite not being very complex. None of the puzzles took me more than a few seconds to work out, but at the same time none of them felt stupid. I’m still not sure how Starbreeze struck that balance. You can see a similar balance in the storyline.\n\nThe game’s Sims-style gibberish manages to communicate that two brothers -- one in the midst of adolescence and the other reaching the end of childhood, must go on a quest to find a legendary medicine for their ailing father. There’s a lot of other interesting and well-told stuff in there as the brothers meet ever-wilder characters on their journey.\n\nSimilar to Team Ico’s games, Brothers also takes you through environments that immediately feel like they have stories of their own, like the aftermath of a battlefield or the wake of a natural disaster. Furthermore, the game doesn’t even tell you the full story of what’s transpired in front of you, it just let’s you infer things.\n\nThe art direction in Brothers serves all these environments and characters well despite it being quite modest in the technical area -- no fancy effects or anything and the system requirements don’t list any recommended settings, only minimum. Everything is in a sort of round, chunky aesthetic which seems to play to the Unreal 3 Engine’s strengths similarly to Gears of War 3.\n\nBrothers is a very tightly-put-together little adventure game that hits the hallmarks of what it’s probably trying to evoke: inspired fairy-tale locales, smart-but-intuitive gameplay, and an emotional storyline that doesn’t rely too much on cut scenes or any text, though the whole game will last you no more than three hours.","January 15, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The journey that started in a quintessential village quickly gave way to the fantastical; each new area tells a story of its own through its presentation and together they are woven into the lore of this new world to explore.\n\nNot approaching the game as a puzzle or adventure game greatly enhances the experience. It felt more akin to an 3 hour epic. While it has some minor issues that I can’t mention without spoiling the game, I enjoyed the game overall and would highly recommend it. The last 30 minutes is when the magic happens.\n\nPS: play with a gamepad","February 22, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It simply cannot be recommended enough. I'm actually writing a recommendation for it immediately after finishing it, because it's just that good.\n\nThe controls are amazing and fun, and they're often incredibly well used. There's no "Press E to Perform Complex Action" here. For example, you actually have to rotate the analog sticks to have your brothers spin a crank. The game's not completely unchallenging, but most of the focus is on overcoming and executing it rather than the usual annoying, long, drawn-out search for a solution to figure out the puzzle.\n\nThe story is just absolutely wonderous, and without comparison to anything I've ever played in a game, or encountered pretty much anywhere, ever. It's fun, funny, and heartwarming at times; thrilling at others; and at points staggeringly sorrowful. I spent the entire end of the game crying, and I'm about to start again. This is also the first and probably only time I've ever found myself crying over a game mechanic, - it was just that amazingly touching. (You'll see what I mean at the end, I refuse to be more specific for fear of spoiling it.)\n\nThis is the only time I've regretted buying a game on sale - I honestly wish I'd bought it for full price, just in the hopes of making it that much more likely I'd see another game even close to this good.","November 8, 2013","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game... just wow.\n\nBrothers was an absolute joy to play. The largest reason being that Brothers is extremely immersive, connecting the player to the game better than almost any other game I have played. This can be attributed to the unique "single-player co-op" mechanic whereby the player uses a single controller to control two in game players. Just as the controller cannot be ripped in part at will, nor can these Brothers. As a player you are connected to the brothers immediately and that connection only becomes stronger over the next two an a half hours as you travel the stunningly beautiful lands, solving puzzles, meeting other creatures, and exploring the world, all in search for the elixir to save your ill father.\n\nWhile the game is short, and the gameplay is very easy, Brothers as an overall experience is beautiful, immersive, heart-wrenching, and pleasurable. I highly recommend this game, it is fantastic.\n\nPros:\n• Well written and rich story.\n• Simple, elegant presentation.\n• Stunning visuals.\n• Extremely immersive controls.\n\nCons:\n• Graphical fidelity suffers at points, mainly close ups.","December 29, 2013","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controlling both characters is neat.\n*  The puzzles are fun, if a bit simple.\n*  The world is fantastic and exciting.  Beautiful art and interesting setting.\n*  For the most part I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen on the next part of their adventure.\n\nThe bad:\n*  The main storyline is aweful.  Extremely cliche, and where the designer expects the player to feel emotional impact there is none, because he never bothered to develop the characters in a meaningful way.  The last 15 minutes of the game were painful to paly through because of how forced it felt.  Luckily through most of the game the main story stays out of the way.\n*  The controls are cludgy when they work, and I had to edit a .ini file burried in the games configs in order for it to use my controller correctly (the left sticks Y was flipped, and the game's built in menus don't have ways to change things like that)\n*  The game is very slow to start (and slow to end)  The first 15 minutes of the game feel like pointlessly running around a town.\n*  The game is very short.  All of it high quality but it wont last you very long.\n\nDespite my gripes I found the game to be a lot of fun to play, and well worth the price of admission if you can pick it up on sale.

While this seems like a rather weak call to action, the world really is so beautiful that you won't care. A playthrough lasts about three hours, and the story really flourishes in the second half of the game, once you've had time to get your head around the mechanics.\n\nThe brothers are unique and lovingly crafted, each with his own personality and flaws.

This adventure will take them across a vast land filled with various kinds of fantasy characters and settings. The story and setting are absolutely the main attractions of this game. The plot  starts off as the run of the mill story, but once the game gets going you will run into some interesting situations that makes this game what it is. One gripe I had early on is that all of the characters speak in some sort of gibberish, and while the animations of the characters convey their feelings adequately it can feel like you are missing out. That said the lack of actual dialogue grew on me and I actually prefer it.\n\nGameplay/constrols: This game is unique as you control both brothers using a stick and bumper button for each brother. This is the reason a controller is highly recommended for playing. I did not try using KB and mouse so I cannot compare, but I imagine it is difficult. For the most part the control scheme works with only the occasional mixup in my coordination of controlling the brothers. The game is filled with puzzles that consist of one borther using one strength to do one task like fitting through small areas and the other brother pulling big heavy levers. There are also some puzzles and platforming aspects that require both brothers to work together. Overall the puzzles will not be challenging at all, but they are entertaining nonetheless.\n\nLength/replayability: This game is very short and only clocks in at around 3 hours. There are no sidequests, only little interactions with the world you can have; most of which are acheivements. Once you have completed the game and got all of te acheivements though there will be no reason to replay this game for a long time.\n\nOverall: The price of $15 for this game is steep considering it's length, but despite that I absolutely recommened this game especially if it is on sale.","December 30, 2013","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even with a controller, this game feels wonky as hell trying to control both brothers at the same time. And by the end of the game, I don't think my skills controlling them had gotten much better, either lol.\n\nThat being said, there's something about the game that makes you want to keep playing. As the player, you want to see how the story progresses, and part of you just wants to see the what the next area will look like because this game is so damn pretty. You also feel invested in what's going on, and I think if I had to use one word to descibe this game, it would be 'feel'. The game does make you feel, and that's why I said I somewhat hated it. I wasn't expecting to feel anything. I thought I would just play the game to and be able to say that, "yeah, I played through it, it was a pretty cool story", and leave it at that.

I picked this up quite a while a go during a sale and only because I heard YouTube personality TotalBisquit say this was his favourite game.\nAfter playing (and finishing) it, I can understand why.\n\nYou follow the two Brothers on their quest to find a rare medicine to cure their father and help them climb mountains, fly across valleys, make their way through villages and castles, across devastaded battlefields and frozen rivers. The level design is just awesome and so beautiful I couldn't help but wish to be living there. The soundtrack too is great and fits the game and the mood perfectly.\nWhile it takes some time to really get used to the controls (Xbox controller is required) - you control both brothers at once, using both sticks - it never gets frustrating or annoying as the game helps you out a lot and never really is too hard to be blamed on the controls.\nThere are no fights or puzzles, just some smal objectives like having to pull a lever with one brother while hangling across a pit with the other, in order to create a path for the big brother once you reached the other side. May sound boring, but the landscapes and the characters somehow get you entertained anyway. Plus, the game is easily beatable in under two hours, so there isn't much time to get bored anyway.\nBiggest highlight of the game however is how it makes you like the characters in a way only few other games do, and the ending deserves a special mention too as it is just beautiful and really really really well made. Did I already mention how beautiful the landscapes are?\n\nHighly recommended for anyone, especially during a sale!","April 6, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I wouldn't pay full price for it, I'd wait for a sale, it's an experience that MUST be had. Especially if you like stories of family and loss.\n\n9/10 could not be further from the truth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDPoZ/recommended/225080/","JDPoZ","JDPoZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDPoZ/","200 products in account","An incredibly powerful short story about 2 brothers on a quest through a dangerous and fantastic land to find a magic water with healing powers that can save their dying father.\n\nThe mechanics play just as big a part in the story as the story itself.\nThe design is nothing short of masterful. Every new puzzle is simple yet never easy and always rewarding to complete. Challenges are explained without the use of specific audio or textual direction; only pantomime and vocal tones without the use of a dechiperable language. I do think I knew the brothers' names by the end of the story, only because throughout the game each brother calls out to the other ever so often, each always repeating a specific word (similar to how you as a player come to grasp the name of the hero's horse in Shadow of the Colossus). Every dangerous situation with a new puzzle mechanic had always already been taught to the player in a safe sandbox area so that they are always prepared for when a situation called to re-use that mechanic in an unsafe part of the world. Never was anything similar to what you might call a "modern tutorial" was ever needed.\n\nOne particular moment near the end of the game must be recognized. In this moment, the designers pull off one of the most amazing feats of creative direction I've ever seen. There is a very specific set of challenges with an ostensibly new mechanic that is not explicitly explained in the ways most of the previous ones have been... but the designers know from your experiences in the game, you will naturally try to solve it in a very specific way. To "count on" a player to not only figure something like this out but to also grasp WHY they made this decision usually is a bad idea or requires a tutorial or some sort of cookie to let you know why some choice was made, but in this specific instance, the magic moment you understand what was trying to be done would have been shattered if you were not given the chance to figure it out yourself.\n\nThis might sound a bit confusing, but that moment, even if you aren't worried about spoilers, is indeed a hard moment to explain. I hate to refer to a specific trope often used for hyperbole, but the only comparison I can think of in a similar medium is that of trying to explain what "The Matrix" is. No one can show you what it is, you just have to see and experience it for yourself to understand it. That near-end game scene in Brothers is like that. Someone explaining it to you won't impact you the same as experiencing it.\n\nTo those planning on playing this masterpiece, do NOT read anything about this game's story or watch any playthroughs. The game will always challenge you to think, but will never prove frustrating. And the best part of it is discovering the answers to the questions it asks you on your own. Looking up anything on it will surely lessen your experience. The achievements should be discovered and completed naturally as you play. I recommend holding off trying to follow any walkthroughs or guides in an effort to conquer every single one of the game's hidden side quests until after you complete the game at least once.\n\nSpeaking as someone who has an older half-brother, and a younger brother, if you have any siblings, you need to play this. You will be moved beyond words.\n\nOh, and buyers who tend to collect and not play, don't let this sit on your "wall of shame" either. It's really short. Only about 3 hours to complete. Set aside a few hours and do it all in 1 or 2 sittings. It is an important game that marks a point in gaming history when designers were able to evoke a feeling in a way that no other medium could do. Other designers will be talking about and trying to understand and mimic this perfect execution of this moment for years to come.\n\nIf this still isn't enough to convince you to buy the game, then listen to a much bigger game critic celebrity, TotalBiscuit, call the game "the best game I've ever played in 25 years."\nhttp://youtu.be/lz3EmqraAxc","November 3, 2013","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Somehow, Brothers delivers an emotional, compassionate story, without a single word of dialogue in the whole game. Charcaters do speak, but their language is Simmilar to Simlish (The Sims) I suppose. Although you cannot understand the language, You will still understand what is going on. You will have to prepare yourself for many emotions throughout the game. I will list a few I've experienced: Sadness, joy, wonder, curiousity, horror, excitement, and despair. Sounds a bit over the top? Well go see for yourself. You may experience emotions you never new existed.\n\nBrothers perfectly marries Story with Game Mechanics. The best way i can explain it is that you play the story. Again, for lack of a better term, Brothers is a Singleplayer Co-op game. If you were not aware, You control two Brothers independently using the joysicks of your controller (Provided you use a controller). Contrary to the Notice above, The game will work with a keyboard, But I would not recommend it. Seperately controlling the two siblings, you traverse the game working together. I would not classify Brothers as a Puzzle Platformer, however. It's simply a journey. Which brings me to the final point.\n\nBrothers took me roughly 3 hours to complete. I would say there is some replayability, but thats only because there are achievements you will miss and areas you may have skipped. So maybe 5 - 6 hours will be all you get out of Brothers, unless you play through games several times. I know that so few hours may not warrant the price for some people, but I promise you'll remember this game for as long as you live. I know I will.","December 8, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First off having to use both my right and left hands to control two different characters is a very unique gameplay. Second, is each brother has a very different personality and you want to see how each react to characters/items. For example, the older brother is mature, strong, and driven. While the younger brother is naughty, afraid of water, and great with animals. The brothers must work together to pass small obstacles.\nMy last favorite thing so far, is there is no guide... no map... and a gibberish language. All you know is you need to find some "tree" to heal your father. This means you need to watch the reactions of other characters and basically touch/look at everything. Some characters will be ♥♥♥♥♥ and waste your time, but some with point you in the right direction.

You can use other dual stick controllers (I used a PS2 controller), but you will probably need to use a small free program called x360ce which is an xbox 360 controller emulator. This will tell the game you are using an xbox controller and the program will let you map the keys on your controller.

We do not need to have the person next to us to have them influence us. And this game portrays that idea perfectly. It is a simple story of two brothers and their journey together to help find a cure for their father. You control one brother with the left thumbstick and the other brother with the right thumbstick. And throughout the journey, they have to rely on each other to get past certain obstacles. The story is very moving and portrays life and death in an interesting way through its cutscenes.\n\nThe game is not all doom and gloom though. There are many beautiful moments that depict the beauty of life, whether you're stopping a man from committing suicide or reuniting a mother turtle with its children. Although those are optional tasks, it is left to the player to make those decisions and make this tough journey bearable.\n\nThe game can get a little glitchy from time to time but it left such an impact on me that the negatives did not bother me so much. It is a fairly short game but this is definitely something that is going to stick with you.","December 28, 2013","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/225080/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","The game lacked a lot of impact for me and the story wasn't anything to write home about. However it was still a nice experience and the art style and graphics are quite nice.\n\n(I played this game entirely on the xbox 360 gamepad by the way.)\n\nThis game felt like a dark childrens book, it was quite whimsical at times, very funny and silly, but it got hauntingly dark too. And thankfully, without remorse. That, is a very strong mark for this game. I think this may be a spoiler, but I was really expecting it to undo what it had done. I am very glad that it didn't.\n\nBefore I get to where I want to go, I want to talk about the controls. The controls tangled your fingers up into a knot, I don't really mind that. But with the very simple control layout, this game controlled very basically. The controls were not interesting in the slightest and really it just boiled down to building a control scheme onto that same controller in essence. Wasn't really anything ground breaking. You could change your camera view, move two characters with the analouge sticks. And then you have two action triggers/keys, for each of the respective characters. So really you'd just move around and press the action trigger/key and see what happens.\n\nBy the way, this game's store page lied, you DON'T need a xbox 360 controller to play this game. You can play it on the keyboard too as I could tell in the options menu.\n\n\nAnyway, I don't really know how to explain why it felt like and experience to me over a story. Perhaps it has to do with how shallow everything felt regarding characters. I felt like absolutely no one had a real backstory or depth besides the young boy. Using them to interact with the world had very expressive reactions. The older brother was boring, he was completely neutral the entire story and just struck me as a faceless robot kind of chugging along on this quest. Even his 1 flashback was really shallow and boring and felt irrelevant. It just reminded me of the father i'm trying to save. It didn't give the brother any face-value and only seemed to show aggression to his brother at time when his brother was unokay with something. That or he'd just show leadership or be protective of his brother. Other than that, he had absolutely no depth whatsoever and he was easily forgettable. Really, I felt only interested in him cause he looked cool. I didn't like the little brother because he looks like a doof to me. But after watching the little bothers events and personality and backstory unfold a little bit (not enough I'd say) he was much more interesting and likeable.\n\nNext up is the graphics. Graphics were good, I mean. I am unsure about the detailing, at times they felt not shaded enough, detailed enough, or they didn't flow together well enough. Though the graphics and displays and scenery was good enough to definitely warrant a second playthrough with your finger on the steam screencapture key, that's for sure. Definitely good desktop wallpaper material in here. Also can be aspring for some artists I can imagine.\n\n\nThere were some moments of tenseness in this game, surprisingly. As the game got progressively dark and took a really unexpected dip into limbo-like depressive stuff all of a sudden. I think there was only one or two parts that really made me have to actually pay attention to my controls, very sure it was once only. And that was a damn good part, glad it wasn't necessary to the story, felt very important to me though. And I like that, i'm glad I got a opportunity to side-track in the game and find things that were important to me instead of the characters. It was nice.\n\nThat being said, this games trip into darkness and doing scenarios that aren't often done in video games was truly surprising and i'm really glad they didn't regret any of the decisions they decided to do in it. Because I feel like that's what saved the game for me a little bit. It was a nice journey and it was fun and relaxing.\nMost deaths in this game really only occur when the controls are a little too unclear, but you figure out what went wrong almost immediately, so it's not big deal.\n\nThat being said, I'd really like to give the developers a BIG thumbs up to one part they made me do. It was something I never want to do in a video game ever again, it just felt all kinds of wrong and messed up to me. I'd like to compliment another part about it, but. I won't, cause spoilers. But, it was good. And i'm glad you didn't reverse it.\n\n\nAlso, lastly. The music. ...It was really easy to ignore it. It really was. It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything to remember. When my mind actually did pick up some of the tracks, I was instantly dissuaded to bother youtube searching it because that same track felt like a reoccuring theme in any "deep" moments. Whenever something interested happened or a cutscene happened, tracks that sound like that song I heard. Sounded just like remixed versions of it with added or removed instruments and spacing between instrument play times and so on so forth to fit the timing they wanted to match or feelings they wanted to convey in the cut scenes. So the only interesting track was pretty much just rehashed to me in a uninteresting way and most of the scenes were impactful. Even the ones that were supposed to bother you.\nAlso with that, I don't get why they put this skyrim-sounding song at the end of the game. It really made no sense, it was all epic and then nothing happened. After everything that happened in the game, it made absolutely no sense when it played. It didn't match the mood of what was going on at all. I don't know who's choice that was, but it wasn't a good one.\n\nAnyway, while the game was lackluster in personality I feel, as far as experience goes it was quite something and it was definitely a pleasurable way to spend my morning and part of my afternoon. I would recommend this to someone who wouldn't mind going on a enjoyable light puzzle/adventure. If you want to get your hands on this game, sure, I suppose 14.99 is a fair asking price. However I think paying ten bucks for this product is a good buy, any less than that is too low for what you're getting.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my review.

That doesn't really matter however.\n\nBrothers is an amazing tale, conveyed almost without words in a way reminiscent of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. The charazterization of the characters is also in itself simple, but strong. You will love these brothers and sympathize with their struggle just as you'll stand amazed at the detail and imagination invested into this fictional world, and that's part of the tragedy. The game KNOWS what you think it is. It knows what you expect. It's masterfully directed and built to get you emotionally invested in its story.\n\nSaying any more than that would spoil the surprises you'll have along the way, but fair warning: the game is not a happy-go-lucky fairy tale and it will shock you, scare you and ultimately make you cry your soul out.\n\n10/10.","January 19, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is short (approximately 2-3 hours) but what it does in that time is more than some games try to do in 30 hours.  The puzzles and the controlling brothers mechanic are used exretemely well and there really isn't a great deal of repetitiveness in those puzzles.  Each puzzle is a short unique puzzle to solve and then move quickly to the next puzzle/story element.\n\nThere is not a lot of fluff or down time in the game.

It's not that the game can be beat in one sitting, it's that the game is so well paced that you want to finish it in one sitting.

It simply cannot be recommended enough. I'm actually writing a recommendation for it immediately after finishing it, because it's just that good.\n\nThe controls are amazing and fun, and they're often incredibly well used. There's no "Press E to Perform Complex Action" here. For example, you actually have to rotate the analog sticks to have your brothers spin a crank. The game's not completely unchallenging, but most of the focus is on overcoming and executing it rather than the usual annoying, long, drawn-out search for a solution to figure out the puzzle.\n\nThe story is just absolutely wonderous, and without comparison to anything I've ever played in a game, or encountered pretty much anywhere, ever. It's fun, funny, and heartwarming at times; thrilling at others; and at points staggeringly sorrowful. I spent the entire end of the game crying, and I'm about to start again. This is also the first and probably only time I've ever found myself crying over a game mechanic, - it was just that amazingly touching. (You'll see what I mean at the end, I refuse to be more specific for fear of spoiling it.)\n\nThis is the only time I've regretted buying a game on sale - I honestly wish I'd bought it for full price, just in the hopes of making it that much more likely I'd see another game even close to this good.","November 8, 2013","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game... just wow.\n\nBrothers was an absolute joy to play. The largest reason being that Brothers is extremely immersive, connecting the player to the game better than almost any other game I have played. This can be attributed to the unique "single-player co-op" mechanic whereby the player uses a single controller to control two in game players. Just as the controller cannot be ripped in part at will, nor can these Brothers. As a player you are connected to the brothers immediately and that connection only becomes stronger over the next two an a half hours as you travel the stunningly beautiful lands, solving puzzles, meeting other creatures, and exploring the world, all in search for the elixir to save your ill father.\n\nWhile the game is short, and the gameplay is very easy, Brothers as an overall experience is beautiful, immersive, heart-wrenching, and pleasurable. I highly recommend this game, it is fantastic.\n\nPros:\n• Well written and rich story.\n• Simple, elegant presentation.\n• Stunning visuals.\n• Extremely immersive controls.\n\nCons:\n• Graphical fidelity suffers at points, mainly close ups.","December 29, 2013","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controlling both characters is neat.\n*  The puzzles are fun, if a bit simple.\n*  The world is fantastic and exciting.  Beautiful art and interesting setting.\n*  For the most part I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen on the next part of their adventure.\n\nThe bad:\n*  The main storyline is aweful.  Extremely cliche, and where the designer expects the player to feel emotional impact there is none, because he never bothered to develop the characters in a meaningful way.  The last 15 minutes of the game were painful to paly through because of how forced it felt.  Luckily through most of the game the main story stays out of the way.\n*  The controls are cludgy when they work, and I had to edit a .ini file burried in the games configs in order for it to use my controller correctly (the left sticks Y was flipped, and the game's built in menus don't have ways to change things like that)\n*  The game is very slow to start (and slow to end)  The first 15 minutes of the game feel like pointlessly running around a town.\n*  The game is very short.  All of it high quality but it wont last you very long.\n\nDespite my gripes I found the game to be a lot of fun to play, and well worth the price of admission if you can pick it up on sale.

While this seems like a rather weak call to action, the world really is so beautiful that you won't care.

He got me interested in the game and a few days later i bought it when it was on sale. Because this game is about 2 brothers, i took the oppertunity to play this game with my little brother (10 years younger than me). We ended up finishing the entire game together, playing at the same time or occasionally taking turns when one of us was about to die of sleep deprivation. This game is meant to be single player, but you can technically make it a co-op if you share the controller. So grab your brother (or better yet, 2 misbehaving siblings you want to teach a lesson about taking turns and co-operating with one another) and start the game up!\n\nRegarding myself and the little brother i played it with, we're 10 years apart. I'm nearing my 20's and he's still in elementary school at the time of this review. I wouldn't reccomend playing this game with a younger brother whose uncomfortable with themes of death and darkness. If you decide to play with a younger brother who doesn't understand the concept of death yet or is slowly learning the concept of death, this game may be a good way to introduce them to those themes, but this game CAN GET DARK. The game has many themes of death and it's very much a coming of age story for both brothers. In the game you'll encounter dead bodies, scary graveyards, nature coming to life trying to kill you,  SPIDERS , and an NPC 'tempting his own fate' to put it lightly... So just use your own judgement regarding your experience with your little brother of choice. As for the adorable child i played with, he can tolerate most things and only flat out refused to play the game in one section because he witnessed some gore he wasn't expecting but easily shook that off and played with me again immediately after that section was over. We played the game up until the end, wtinessed the ending together and he is not psychologically scarred by it in any way. We only used a walkthrough ONE time and even after the game was over we jokingly call eachother what the Brothers call eachother in the game.\n\nOk, now onto the review:\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a puzzle/adventure game similar to the likes of ICO and Shadow of the Collasus for the PS2. The world Brothers takes place in is GORGEOUS to look at and feels incredibly massive but dangerous at the same time.  If you love RPGs and puzzles with huge worlds you'll love the way this one looks and feels. Unlike ICO and Shadow, the controls for brothers are extremely simple. You move with the analog sticks and interact with R2/L2. You can play solo controlling both titular brothers or grab any male sibling you get along with and each of you can share the controller, controlling 1 brother each. Both brothers are also very balanced. Big Brother (Maya?) is strong and tall but he doesn't jump very high or run as fast as Little Brother (Maii?), who is weaker and shorter but can jump higher. They can help eachother around the enviornment by picking eachother up, helping eachother up ladders, solve puzzles together in ways renimicent to ICO and Yorda and they're enjoyable to play as despite speaking a nonsense language (also very similar to the language spoken in ICO).\n\nThe story is a simple fetch quest. The boys father gets sick and they must retrieve an antidote from a tree hidden up in the mountains. And that's it. The story doesn't get more complex than that save for the fact their mother has died by drowning and Little Brother is also trauamtized by that event and unlike Big Brother, he can't swim. The game isn't so much about a story, it's more about a journey. The landscapes are beautiful and while wandering the world i couldn't help but want to know more about the lore of the world they're travelling through. It feels very Scandinavian in nature, what with all the giants, the beautiful snowscape, the water and the beautiful castles. I can't get over how wonderfult he game looks. At first glance, this looks like one of those games that'll look better than it actually is but in the case of Brothers, i say the looks are just a bonus for the journey. As for the journey is self, all the puzzles are solveable. If you play with a friend or a brother of your own, niether of you will get too frustrated.\n\nOne thing that prevents me from buying most adventure/puzzle games is if the puzzles will be solveable. It's what makes or breaks a puzzle game. And thankfully despite the occasional camera wonky-ness all of the puzzles are solveable without a walkthrough. For myself and my brother, we only used a walkthrough for one puzzle we were confused on and after 10 minutes of testing theories we gave up and resorted to youtube. But other than that small experience, you could easily get through all the puzzles and they can all be solved without ripping your hair out trying to retrace your steps. Everything you need is always in the right place, where you need to go is always hinted at, you sometimes just need to look from a new perspective or look a little more carefully. For me at least, i enjoyed that the puzzles weren't too complex. If the puzzles are too complex that's usually the point where i give up on the game. And the puzzle layout is especially useful if you plan on playing with your younger brother.\n\nThis is one of those rare occasions where i can say nothing bad about this game. Maybe 1 thing i can complain about the is the normal price which is 14.99, but i bought this game on sale and ended up getting is for around 3.75 (something like that) and completed the whole game in about 5/6 hours spanning a few different days because i was playing this with another person. Had i played the game solo, i likely would've finished it a lot faster. I'm one of those gamers who wants alot of gameplay for their money. Because i got this on sale i'd say i'm pretty lucky but the normal price may be a bit high if you value how many hours you'll get out of a game, but thankfully this game ain't 60 bucks, so 15 isn't that much of a bad price in my opinion.\n\nYeah, i have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BAD TO SAY. It's very surprising 0_0;\n\nThis is just one of those games where you love the journey and can't see much bad about it.\nIt was an especially good bonding experience playing this game with my own brother, as we discussed how different puzzles could be solved, helped eachother progress through the journey and occasionally have mom yell at us when we were yelling at the brothers on screen. I can't imagine playing this game alone save maybe for the occasion where you've already beaten the game and wanna play it for nostalgia, gawk at the beauty of the setting or just wanna get all the achievements. I wholly suggest playing this game with another person (especially a brother).\n\nI give Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons 10 sets of brothers out of 5!","August 18, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/225080/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","The game lacked a lot of impact for me and the story wasn't anything to write home about. However it was still a nice experience and the art style and graphics are quite nice.\n\n(I played this game entirely on the xbox 360 gamepad by the way.)\n\nThis game felt like a dark childrens book, it was quite whimsical at times, very funny and silly, but it got hauntingly dark too. And thankfully, without remorse. That, is a very strong mark for this game. I think this may be a spoiler, but I was really expecting it to undo what it had done. I am very glad that it didn't.\n\nBefore I get to where I want to go, I want to talk about the controls. The controls tangled your fingers up into a knot, I don't really mind that. But with the very simple control layout, this game controlled very basically. The controls were not interesting in the slightest and really it just boiled down to building a control scheme onto that same controller in essence. Wasn't really anything ground breaking. You could change your camera view, move two characters with the analouge sticks. And then you have two action triggers/keys, for each of the respective characters. So really you'd just move around and press the action trigger/key and see what happens.\n\nBy the way, this game's store page lied, you DON'T need a xbox 360 controller to play this game. You can play it on the keyboard too as I could tell in the options menu.\n\n\nAnyway, I don't really know how to explain why it felt like and experience to me over a story. Perhaps it has to do with how shallow everything felt regarding characters. I felt like absolutely no one had a real backstory or depth besides the young boy. Using them to interact with the world had very expressive reactions. The older brother was boring, he was completely neutral the entire story and just struck me as a faceless robot kind of chugging along on this quest. Even his 1 flashback was really shallow and boring and felt irrelevant. It just reminded me of the father i'm trying to save. It didn't give the brother any face-value and only seemed to show aggression to his brother at time when his brother was unokay with something. That or he'd just show leadership or be protective of his brother. Other than that, he had absolutely no depth whatsoever and he was easily forgettable. Really, I felt only interested in him cause he looked cool. I didn't like the little brother because he looks like a doof to me. But after watching the little bothers events and personality and backstory unfold a little bit (not enough I'd say) he was much more interesting and likeable.\n\nNext up is the graphics. Graphics were good, I mean. I am unsure about the detailing, at times they felt not shaded enough, detailed enough, or they didn't flow together well enough. Though the graphics and displays and scenery was good enough to definitely warrant a second playthrough with your finger on the steam screencapture key, that's for sure. Definitely good desktop wallpaper material in here. Also can be aspring for some artists I can imagine.\n\n\nThere were some moments of tenseness in this game, surprisingly. As the game got progressively dark and took a really unexpected dip into limbo-like depressive stuff all of a sudden. I think there was only one or two parts that really made me have to actually pay attention to my controls, very sure it was once only. And that was a damn good part, glad it wasn't necessary to the story, felt very important to me though. And I like that, i'm glad I got a opportunity to side-track in the game and find things that were important to me instead of the characters. It was nice.\n\nThat being said, this games trip into darkness and doing scenarios that aren't often done in video games was truly surprising and i'm really glad they didn't regret any of the decisions they decided to do in it. Because I feel like that's what saved the game for me a little bit. It was a nice journey and it was fun and relaxing.\nMost deaths in this game really only occur when the controls are a little too unclear, but you figure out what went wrong almost immediately, so it's not big deal.\n\nThat being said, I'd really like to give the developers a BIG thumbs up to one part they made me do. It was something I never want to do in a video game ever again, it just felt all kinds of wrong and messed up to me. I'd like to compliment another part about it, but. I won't, cause spoilers. But, it was good. And i'm glad you didn't reverse it.\n\n\nAlso, lastly. The music. ...It was really easy to ignore it. It really was. It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything to remember. When my mind actually did pick up some of the tracks, I was instantly dissuaded to bother youtube searching it because that same track felt like a reoccuring theme in any "deep" moments. Whenever something interested happened or a cutscene happened, tracks that sound like that song I heard. Sounded just like remixed versions of it with added or removed instruments and spacing between instrument play times and so on so forth to fit the timing they wanted to match or feelings they wanted to convey in the cut scenes. So the only interesting track was pretty much just rehashed to me in a uninteresting way and most of the scenes were impactful. Even the ones that were supposed to bother you.\nAlso with that, I don't get why they put this skyrim-sounding song at the end of the game. It really made no sense, it was all epic and then nothing happened. After everything that happened in the game, it made absolutely no sense when it played. It didn't match the mood of what was going on at all. I don't know who's choice that was, but it wasn't a good one.\n\nAnyway, while the game was lackluster in personality I feel, as far as experience goes it was quite something and it was definitely a pleasurable way to spend my morning and part of my afternoon. I would recommend this to someone who wouldn't mind going on a enjoyable light puzzle/adventure. If you want to get your hands on this game, sure, I suppose 14.99 is a fair asking price. However I think paying ten bucks for this product is a good buy, any less than that is too low for what you're getting.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to get this game or not. Have a good one.","January 27, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is short (approximately 2-3 hours) but what it does in that time is more than some games try to do in 30 hours.  The puzzles and the controlling brothers mechanic are used exretemely well and there really isn't a great deal of repetitiveness in those puzzles.  Each puzzle is a short unique puzzle to solve and then move quickly to the next puzzle/story element.\n\nThere is not a lot of fluff or down time in the game.  It is paced exteremly well, moving from puzzle to story to puzzle to story.  It's not that the game can be beat in one sitting, it's that the game is so well paced that you want to finish it in one sitting.  There's no big down boring parts or excessively frustrating puzzles, just small simple well excuted game play that makes you want to keep moving on.\n\nThe world that the developers created to tell their story in was beautiful.  There was some really unique areas with some unique characters as well.\n\nEverything comes together in one great package to make one of the best indie games that I have played.  Highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a great indie experience.","October 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Later on that turned into an affection for cartoons, providing an enchanting athmosphere for the never-to-grow-up child inside of us. If you have ever longed for grasping that feel of the ancient lovable fairytales in a game, this title is ment for you.\nBrothers places together all the parts necessary to build up a story around you that will stick you down into your chair. You start with a sick father and two worried brothers, setting out for the journey to get the cure which can save the old man. The game is basically made for co-op play on one machine, but it can be a tricky  finger excercise for single player as well. We have played through the whole adventure with my girlfriend in two days. That might seem a bit short, but considering the common adventure, it turned out to be just the right amount of time to delight the both of us. The game mechanincs are quite simple: one brother suitable for the first move of the puzzle goes ahead while the other will depend on the former's help to push through. One striking feature is the storytelling without a single articulate word. The characters behave and talk in a way that will surely make you understand whatever is happening at the moment. Among such circumstances imagery will take the leading role and that is another remarkable aspect of the game. Every last frame of it is well-planned and all of the screenshots you take would make a nice picture in your bedroom (believe me, or look it up in my screenshot section - spoilers at later pictures!!). The textures, tones and camera settings build up a marvelously charming athmosphere, leaving you stunned for several seconds with the scenery. You can practically feel the hours of carefuly artistic work put into the job all throughout your adventure. Not only is the artistically composed masterpiece a memorable experience, but it also hints you slightly with fable like qualities. I would hate to say too much, I suggest you jump right into it.","February 26, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the whole button scheme can appear complex at the beginning, it quickly grows very comfortable to the player after some minutes in. Brothers is also able to use the simple premise of the gameplay to issue you more and more original challenges as you progress in the game, never giving you the feeling you are doing the same thing over and over again.\nWhile the artistic direction is pretty gorgeous and gives away a distinct fairy tale vibe and the writing isn't afraid of getting darker and darker as the boys' quest advances, Brothers - A Tale of Two sons is remarkably short: I was able to clear it in under four hours.

He got me interested in the game and a few days later i bought it when it was on sale. Because this game is about 2 brothers, i took the oppertunity to play this game with my little brother (10 years younger than me). We ended up finishing the entire game together, playing at the same time or occasionally taking turns when one of us was about to die of sleep deprivation. This game is meant to be single player, but you can technically make it a co-op if you share the controller. So grab your brother (or better yet, 2 misbehaving siblings you want to teach a lesson about taking turns and co-operating with one another) and start the game up!\n\nRegarding myself and the little brother i played it with, we're 10 years apart. I'm nearing my 20's and he's still in elementary school at the time of this review. I wouldn't reccomend playing this game with a younger brother whose uncomfortable with themes of death and darkness. If you decide to play with a younger brother who doesn't understand the concept of death yet or is slowly learning the concept of death, this game may be a good way to introduce them to those themes, but this game CAN GET DARK. The game has many themes of death and it's very much a coming of age story for both brothers. In the game you'll encounter dead bodies, scary graveyards, nature coming to life trying to kill you,  SPIDERS , and an NPC 'tempting his own fate' to put it lightly... So just use your own judgement regarding your experience with your little brother of choice. As for the adorable child i played with, he can tolerate most things and only flat out refused to play the game in one section because he witnessed some gore he wasn't expecting but easily shook that off and played with me again immediately after that section was over. We played the game up until the end, wtinessed the ending together and he is not psychologically scarred by it in any way. We only used a walkthrough ONE time and even after the game was over we jokingly call eachother what the Brothers call eachother in the game.\n\nOk, now onto the review:\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a puzzle/adventure game similar to the likes of ICO and Shadow of the Collasus for the PS2. The world Brothers takes place in is GORGEOUS to look at and feels incredibly massive but dangerous at the same time.  If you love RPGs and puzzles with huge worlds you'll love the way this one looks and feels. Unlike ICO and Shadow, the controls for brothers are extremely simple. You move with the analog sticks and interact with R2/L2. You can play solo controlling both titular brothers or grab any male sibling you get along with and each of you can share the controller, controlling 1 brother each. Both brothers are also very balanced. Big Brother (Maya?) is strong and tall but he doesn't jump very high or run as fast as Little Brother (Maii?), who is weaker and shorter but can jump higher. They can help eachother around the enviornment by picking eachother up, helping eachother up ladders, solve puzzles together in ways renimicent to ICO and Yorda and they're enjoyable to play as despite speaking a nonsense language (also very similar to the language spoken in ICO).\n\nThe story is a simple fetch quest. The boys father gets sick and they must retrieve an antidote from a tree hidden up in the mountains. And that's it. The story doesn't get more complex than that save for the fact their mother has died by drowning and Little Brother is also trauamtized by that event and unlike Big Brother, he can't swim. The game isn't so much about a story, it's more about a journey. The landscapes are beautiful and while wandering the world i couldn't help but want to know more about the lore of the world they're travelling through. It feels very Scandinavian in nature, what with all the giants, the beautiful snowscape, the water and the beautiful castles. I can't get over how wonderfult he game looks. At first glance, this looks like one of those games that'll look better than it actually is but in the case of Brothers, i say the looks are just a bonus for the journey. As for the journey is self, all the puzzles are solveable. If you play with a friend or a brother of your own, niether of you will get too frustrated.\n\nOne thing that prevents me from buying most adventure/puzzle games is if the puzzles will be solveable. It's what makes or breaks a puzzle game. And thankfully despite the occasional camera wonky-ness all of the puzzles are solveable without a walkthrough. For myself and my brother, we only used a walkthrough for one puzzle we were confused on and after 10 minutes of testing theories we gave up and resorted to youtube. But other than that small experience, you could easily get through all the puzzles and they can all be solved without ripping your hair out trying to retrace your steps. Everything you need is always in the right place, where you need to go is always hinted at, you sometimes just need to look from a new perspective or look a little more carefully. For me at least, i enjoyed that the puzzles weren't too complex. If the puzzles are too complex that's usually the point where i give up on the game. And the puzzle layout is especially useful if you plan on playing with your younger brother.\n\nThis is one of those rare occasions where i can say nothing bad about this game. Maybe 1 thing i can complain about the is the normal price which is 14.99, but i bought this game on sale and ended up getting is for around 3.75 (something like that) and completed the whole game in about 5/6 hours spanning a few different days because i was playing this with another person. Had i played the game solo, i likely would've finished it a lot faster. I'm one of those gamers who wants alot of gameplay for their money. Because i got this on sale i'd say i'm pretty lucky but the normal price may be a bit high if you value how many hours you'll get out of a game, but thankfully this game ain't 60 bucks, so 15 isn't that much of a bad price in my opinion.\n\nYeah, i have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BAD TO SAY. It's very surprising 0_0;\n\nThis is just one of those games where you love the journey and can't see much bad about it.\nIt was an especially good bonding experience playing this game with my own brother, as we discussed how different puzzles could be solved, helped eachother progress through the journey and occasionally have mom yell at us when we were yelling at the brothers on screen. I can't imagine playing this game alone save maybe for the occasion where you've already beaten the game and wanna play it for nostalgia, gawk at the beauty of the setting or just wanna get all the achievements. I wholly suggest playing this game with another person (especially a brother).\n\nI give Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons 10 sets of brothers out of 5!","August 18, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/225080/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","The game lacked a lot of impact for me and the story wasn't anything to write home about. However it was still a nice experience and the art style and graphics are quite nice.\n\n(I played this game entirely on the xbox 360 gamepad by the way.)\n\nThis game felt like a dark childrens book, it was quite whimsical at times, very funny and silly, but it got hauntingly dark too. And thankfully, without remorse. That, is a very strong mark for this game. I think this may be a spoiler, but I was really expecting it to undo what it had done. I am very glad that it didn't.\n\nBefore I get to where I want to go, I want to talk about the controls. The controls tangled your fingers up into a knot, I don't really mind that. But with the very simple control layout, this game controlled very basically. The controls were not interesting in the slightest and really it just boiled down to building a control scheme onto that same controller in essence. Wasn't really anything ground breaking. You could change your camera view, move two characters with the analouge sticks. And then you have two action triggers/keys, for each of the respective characters. So really you'd just move around and press the action trigger/key and see what happens.\n\nBy the way, this game's store page lied, you DON'T need a xbox 360 controller to play this game. You can play it on the keyboard too as I could tell in the options menu.\n\n\nAnyway, I don't really know how to explain why it felt like and experience to me over a story. Perhaps it has to do with how shallow everything felt regarding characters. I felt like absolutely no one had a real backstory or depth besides the young boy. Using them to interact with the world had very expressive reactions. The older brother was boring, he was completely neutral the entire story and just struck me as a faceless robot kind of chugging along on this quest. Even his 1 flashback was really shallow and boring and felt irrelevant. It just reminded me of the father i'm trying to save. It didn't give the brother any face-value and only seemed to show aggression to his brother at time when his brother was unokay with something. That or he'd just show leadership or be protective of his brother. Other than that, he had absolutely no depth whatsoever and he was easily forgettable. Really, I felt only interested in him cause he looked cool. I didn't like the little brother because he looks like a doof to me. But after watching the little bothers events and personality and backstory unfold a little bit (not enough I'd say) he was much more interesting and likeable.\n\nNext up is the graphics. Graphics were good, I mean. I am unsure about the detailing, at times they felt not shaded enough, detailed enough, or they didn't flow together well enough. Though the graphics and displays and scenery was good enough to definitely warrant a second playthrough with your finger on the steam screencapture key, that's for sure. Definitely good desktop wallpaper material in here. Also can be aspring for some artists I can imagine.\n\n\nThere were some moments of tenseness in this game, surprisingly. As the game got progressively dark and took a really unexpected dip into limbo-like depressive stuff all of a sudden. I think there was only one or two parts that really made me have to actually pay attention to my controls, very sure it was once only. And that was a damn good part, glad it wasn't necessary to the story, felt very important to me though. And I like that, i'm glad I got a opportunity to side-track in the game and find things that were important to me instead of the characters. It was nice.\n\nThat being said, this games trip into darkness and doing scenarios that aren't often done in video games was truly surprising and i'm really glad they didn't regret any of the decisions they decided to do in it. Because I feel like that's what saved the game for me a little bit. It was a nice journey and it was fun and relaxing.\nMost deaths in this game really only occur when the controls are a little too unclear, but you figure out what went wrong almost immediately, so it's not big deal.\n\nThat being said, I'd really like to give the developers a BIG thumbs up to one part they made me do. It was something I never want to do in a video game ever again, it just felt all kinds of wrong and messed up to me. I'd like to compliment another part about it, but. I won't, cause spoilers. But, it was good. And i'm glad you didn't reverse it.\n\n\nAlso, lastly. The music. ...It was really easy to ignore it. It really was. It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything to remember. When my mind actually did pick up some of the tracks, I was instantly dissuaded to bother youtube searching it because that same track felt like a reoccuring theme in any "deep" moments. Whenever something interested happened or a cutscene happened, tracks that sound like that song I heard. Sounded just like remixed versions of it with added or removed instruments and spacing between instrument play times and so on so forth to fit the timing they wanted to match or feelings they wanted to convey in the cut scenes. So the only interesting track was pretty much just rehashed to me in a uninteresting way and most of the scenes were impactful. Even the ones that were supposed to bother you.\nAlso with that, I don't get why they put this skyrim-sounding song at the end of the game. It really made no sense, it was all epic and then nothing happened. After everything that happened in the game, it made absolutely no sense when it played. It didn't match the mood of what was going on at all. I don't know who's choice that was, but it wasn't a good one.\n\nAnyway, while the game was lackluster in personality I feel, as far as experience goes it was quite something and it was definitely a pleasurable way to spend my morning and part of my afternoon. I would recommend this to someone who wouldn't mind going on a enjoyable light puzzle/adventure. If you want to get your hands on this game, sure, I suppose 14.99 is a fair asking price. However I think paying ten bucks for this product is a good buy, any less than that is too low for what you're getting.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to get this game or not. Have a good one.","January 27, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ever since it was released I was interested in getting it, now that I have it I don't regret it in the slightest. It's not extremely difficult to play, the controls kind of take some time to get use to. I would HIGHLY recommend using a controller for this game.\nYou have to control both characters the big brother with the left analog stick/left trigger and the younger brother with the right analog/right trigger. The way you control the two characters to get through the puzzles gradually gets more... intricate.\n\nIt is a pretty entertaining game. Usually when I start off playing a new game like this I only play it to try it out but I started it and haven't put it down yet.\nThe graphics aren't bad at all and i find myself enjoying the scenery.

It's necessary to play with a controller, because you have to move both brothers at the same time.\nThat can sometimes be very frustrating, but the great story, the beautiful sad soundtrack and the lovely graphics really make up for it.\nThis unique game has a gorgeous world with many beautiful details. The graphics are very cute, mostly the expressions of both brothers are quite realistic.  It is shown a really strong bond between Naia, the older brother and Naiee, the younger one. Both of them have simple, but striking personalities, for example Naiee is usually some kind of animal-loving jester, but he shows a deep traumatic fear towards water.\nThe uncommon music fits perfectly into all six landscape you will explore.\nAnother great point which I only recognize in this game is the language. You know exactly, how the characters feel and what they are trying to say, but you aren't able to understand the language itself, because it's only a fantasy language.\n\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a true marriage of gameplay and narrative. It will make you laugh and it will definitely make you cry at the end.  This game is a real must-have for all lonely and depressive people out there, for all of you who don't have much faith in their own abilities, for all of you who want to see how strong love and friendship can be, for all of you who maybe fear the future.","March 15","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seems like nothing great at first glance and I was unsure before buying it, but it was worth it. By worth it I mean the 1.49€ I payed, I don't think I'd recommend buying it for the full price.\n"Brothers" is a very short game and I'd recommend playing it in one long session because the story really sucks you into the environment and it also takes a bit to get used to the unique gameplay mechanics. It took me just about 3h to finish the game, but I derped two or three times. If I knew what to do at every little bit I would have been able to do it in 2.5h.\n\nThe Story\nIt's really not a special setting. Having to complete a far dangerous journey to save a relative is nothing new. But the way it's done is just mind-boggling! The emotions I felt for these characters living through lows and highs (especially the highs are normally rare and hard to implement in sad games!) of their lives really don't compare to anything I have felt in a video game before.\nThe only thing that isn't great about the story is that it is very linear. But that's okay.\nRating 9.5/10\n\nGraphics & technical stuff\nThe graphics are really nothing special. The boys look kind of cute (not in that way! ;D) but the textures are boring. But that's not really the main focus of the game so that's okay.\nThe physics do bug out rather often to the point where it get's a little annoying. For instance right at the start you have to push a cart with both brothers. To pick up the handles of the cart you will have to stand at very specific places with the brothers otherwise it doesn't work. They also move rather jittery sometimes.\nRating 6/10\n\nSummary:\nOverall a definite recommendation, if it is on sale. It's a title you really only play once (linear story) and  that will really only take up one session. But for 1.49€ It's really worth it. Like a really good movie, just a little more involving.","December 31, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are some puzzles but they're all very easy and you shouldn't have trouble with any of them.\n\nThe overall art style is stunning. Beautiful visuals (with many small events which happen in the background) and original score create a mesmerizing world which feels very much alive.\n\nThe game is quite short (~3-3.5 hours) so you will not spend a lot of time with it (recommended for those with huge backlogs).\n\nGet it and play it, this game is definitely worth your money and time.\n\nRecommended input method: Gamepad all the way.

I have to say it is one of my games of the year (though I probably play fewer games than many) and I highly recommend it to everyone.","January 4, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seems like nothing great at first glance and I was unsure before buying it, but it was worth it. By worth it I mean the 1.49€ I payed, I don't think I'd recommend buying it for the full price.\n"Brothers" is a very short game and I'd recommend playing it in one long session because the story really sucks you into the environment and it also takes a bit to get used to the unique gameplay mechanics. It took me just about 3h to finish the game, but I derped two or three times. If I knew what to do at every little bit I would have been able to do it in 2.5h.\n\nThe Story\nIt's really not a special setting. Having to complete a far dangerous journey to save a relative is nothing new. But the way it's done is just mind-boggling! The emotions I felt for these characters living through lows and highs (especially the highs are normally rare and hard to implement in sad games!) of their lives really don't compare to anything I have felt in a video game before.\nThe only thing that isn't great about the story is that it is very linear. But that's okay.\nRating 9.5/10\n\nGraphics & technical stuff\nThe graphics are really nothing special. The boys look kind of cute (not in that way! ;D) but the textures are boring. But that's not really the main focus of the game so that's okay.\nThe physics do bug out rather often to the point where it get's a little annoying. For instance right at the start you have to push a cart with both brothers. To pick up the handles of the cart you will have to stand at very specific places with the brothers otherwise it doesn't work. They also move rather jittery sometimes.\nRating 6/10\n\nSummary:\nOverall a definite recommendation, if it is on sale. It's a title you really only play once (linear story) and  that will really only take up one session. But for 1.49€ It's really worth it. Like a really good movie, just a little more involving.","December 31, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

More than anything else, I am incredibly impressed by Brothers' ability to integrate gameplay mechanics and storytelling in such a way that each complement each other. The thing is, despite video games being an interactive medium, few games seem to take full advantage of this fact. I've played games with great mechanics. I've also played games with great stories.  Hell, I've even played games with both great mechanics and great stories. But Brothers is even more than that. What this game manages to do is give emotional weight to gameplay mechanics. By doing this, Brothers takes full advantage of the agency of the player, deepening the emotional bonds produced over a relatively short few hours.

I feel the urge of writing a couple of lines in appreciation of such a masterpiece.\n\nThere are titles where words are unnecessary, where a single utterance can easily ruin the idilliac atmosphere surrounding a simple, innocent yet mesmerizing narration.\n\nBrothers - A tale of Two Sons easily embodies this description. It finds its strength in its simplicity which makes it innovative.\n\nThe decision of adopting a fictional language without subtitles immediately puts the players inside a real fantasy world, with no connection to reality. It feels like being dragged into that perfect place you'd love to live, perhaps the kind of place you can see in your dreams.\nThe visuals, the entities, the landscape and the invisible forces moving the fate of the two brothers, they all have dream-like features.\nI honestly loved the fact that the player can find a bench every now and then, to simply admire the surrounding, or perform some "side quests" to simply help the others, without the need of a reward.\n\nMorals and ethics are important subjects that are being strongly highlighted in this game, which seems to possess all the features that characterized the typical Bildungsroman.\n\nThe ability of using two characters at one, with their own independent control scheme is just splendid. Personally, this is the first time I am facing such a unique task (on a sidenote, even though the notice says that the game requires a controller, I must disagree with that: I played it with the keyboard and it works simply great) and it's extremely rewarding, besides being a necessary mean to develop with the story.\n\nThe difficulty of the game isn't particularly hard: there are tons of checkpoints and rarely you will be facing a potentially deadly situation, but I believe that is not a negative aspect, as it would lose its aura otherwise.\n\nSo what is Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons?\nIs it a puzzle? A platform? A narrative game?\nIs it even a game or perhaps a piece of virtual literature?\nPerhaps it would require a genre of its own.\nI don't know. I only know that this is a truly magnificent experience, and I am glad I had been a part of it.\n\nGo hit "Add to cart" now, you'll thank me later.","January 23","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was convinced to buy this game thanks to TotalBiscuit - I didn't know this game existed until I saw his video. Is this a great showpiece of gaming that made me cry? Honestly, no. I didn't cry. Whether that's the fault of the game or if I'm too emotionally unresponsive is impossible for me to answer, but you do have a good story based puzzler with a clever mechanic of controlling two characters with a separate analogue stick and trigger. I don't think that the tale alone of a random father who is on his deathbed thanks to an undescribed condition as well as the ending is enough to make me cry - gaming has desensitized me to death.\n\nThere is some gameplay contrivance, such as why is there a funky, switch activated bridge just to get to one family's house? Puzzles are cleverly implemented in my opinion, but all are simple to solved - you'll rarely if ever be stumped. This game has plenty of photogenic moments as shown by my screenshot library, and this can be completed by most around 3 hours. It's arguably pretentious, but I don't think it's trying to force some abstract artistic or literary vision.\n\nBrothers - AToTS looks like something Pixar could do if they weren't limited to doing purely "Disney friendly" content.

This game has a pretty unique and interesting mechanic, where you control both brothers. It can be a bit hard to master, but it is actually not unfair at all.

By the way, there is a certain part of the game that I couldn't pass with the controller, only with the keyboard, because of a bug, I guess.\n\nThis game, unfortunately, has some bugs and glitches that can spoil the fun a bit.

Straight from the beginning, you can tell that this isn't exactly a game suited for kids, as you watch your mother drown to her death in flashback cutscene, when the younger son, Naiee tragically tried to save her, but isn't able to do so in time. I don't wanna spoil anything, but the game is an adventure game that is charming, creepy and lastly, heartwrenching.\n\nThe gameplay starts when Naiee and his elder brother Nyaa carry their father to a doctor, and from there the doctor has them embark on an epic quest to find the healing water. During the epic quest, you encounter folk in the village, farmers, sheep, rabbits, mountain goats; friendly trolls, evil trolls, whales, invisible monsters; giants that fought to their death, wolves, griffins, and much more.\n\nWhile you don't fight any of these beings, and really, only some of them are evil, (the mean trolls, a giant spider, wolves, and some angry cultists), you avoid them by controlling the two brothers. The game plays like a twin stick fighter or shooter, but as a 3rd person, over head view, and puzzle solving, one stick for each brother, and a trigger to interact with objects.\n\nThe game really is epic with the interactions, as you climb, swim, swing, fly, use torches, use various gears and handles; there's a large number of puzzle/interacting; but it's pretty straightforward.\n\nThe graphic style is reminiscent of Fable and Ico, but in its own way, and it works well as the game is gorgeous. The audio is perfect, the music and atmosphere really add to the charm of the game, as well as to the creepiness of certain areas (like the guy who tries to hang himself and you have to choice of stopping him, or the bloody rivers where the giants fought to their death, or the children whose bodies are hanging in the forests).\n\nI managed through the game pretty well, but I have to say that the ending is f*cking depressing. It leaves an emotional impact unlike any game I've ever played.\n\n10/10","April 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
