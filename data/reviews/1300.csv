The game is so bland and predictable, and so much like every other FPS you've ever played in the last 10 years, but it was the FIRST of its kind. You think starting a game with a heli-mounted machine gun section is a filthy cliche? SiN INVENTED that. Cover based shooting? Charging berzerker bosses? Terrible voice acting? Unplayable forced stealth sections? Sewer levels? SiN is guilty of every cliche in the modern FPS dictionary because it INVENTED every cliche in the modern FPS dictionary. SiN is so far ahead of it's time while paradoxically so stuck in the past that it boggles my mind.\n\nThe levels are unintuitive, and will have you backtracking constantly. The enemies are either far too easy or tear off 50% of your health unavoidably. The weapons are uninspired and bland as all hell. The stealth is garbage and isn't even worth attempting unless you HAVE to. The game is absolute balls compared to it's source material, but you know what? Blade, the protagonist is the most Bad-♥♥♥ Mofo I have EVER played, the levels are supremely rewarding, the voice acting may be ♥♥♥♥, but is full of charm. The game is beautifully cinematic in a B-movie sort of way.\n\nSiN is a masterpiece, it is so fantastically average, it exists in trancendant mediocrity.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/1300/","Dukefrukem","Dukefrukem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/","811 products in account","***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN 2006... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it***\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf you figured the gameplay would be similar to Half-Life 2 because they use the same engine, you would figure correctly.  The movement of the characters, the inside and outside environment with impressive lighting and of course the physics are almost identical to Half-Life 2.\n\nBecause SiN uses the same engine has HL2, one might think the games would be so strikingly similar SiN would completely rip off Hl2 in its entirely.  Although the enemies are similar, both games include soldiers in armored suit that sounds like they are talking out of some sort of walkie-talkie, there is enough original material for you to forget about HL2 and start thinking SiN.\n\nOne of the more original ideas is to take the healing method from HL2 and modify it. SiN makes you search for empty canisters that can be found throughout the game, and carry them to wall mounted health stations where they can be used to spray a healing blue cloud.  Other times when you are too lazy to carry the canister, you can just shoot them and the healing cloud will be released around the area, allowing a quick heal but not as complete as it would have been if you had taken it to the station.\n\nAnother neat feature they added was a type of chemical agent, that when exposed to, it increased your response time dramatically.  What does that mean? Well it means they kinda copied F.E.A.R and Max Payne and slowed down time a bit so the player can react to apposing enemies better.  This feature is not controllable, but rather goes into affect when a canister is broken in a gun battle and you walk through he green cloud.  The time it takes to wear off is represented as a green bar on the left side of the screen.  But be careful.  Too much exposure will result in the loss of health.\n\nOver the course of the game, Blade will interact with a few different characters.  We saw in HL2 how impressive Valve was able to create life like faces and by playing through the game, you can see this effect was used in SiN.\n\nBlade also fights along side the hot Jessica Cannon who pretty much resembles Alyx from HL2 and does most of the talking.  But Alyx didn't have her thong strings poking above her hips now did she?\n\nGun battles are similar to HL2.  You are given a handgun at the propitiate time and gradually upgrade to an assault rifle and shotgun, but that's it. I'm guessing the plan on releasing more guns as the episodes continue, but it gets a little repetitive using the same guns after a while.  Most of the soldiers are easy to kill, until you get to the more armored mini-gun soldiers.  One thing SiN lacks that HL2 incorporated so well was a scare factor.  SiN ignores this approach and aims for a more typical shooter where you can see your enemy coming from a couple of feet down the hall or road.\n\nA couple of notes as I investigated SiN a bit further.  I read afterwards that SiN apparently keeps track of your shooting statistics.   The data isn't kept for you to print out and nail to your dorm room wall, but the game actually analyzes the data and will adjust the difficulty level of the game as your progress through the game.  For example; if the game see that out of your last 10 kills, 9 of them were headshots, you may see soldiers appear with helmets or dodge your fire more often.  As I think about it now, I can remember a few instances in the game where I tired to kill an armored soldier and took a lot more ammo then I previously had used.  Very impressive idea for the date of this game.\n\nGraphics/Sound:\n\nSiN is filled with crisp luminous lighting in various different areas of the game.  The soft pastel sunset with a mirrored reflection over the water looks great and need I say HL2ish?  There are numerous scenes throughout the game where you stop fighting and shooting, and just take a moment to look at the scenery, or when you're inside, look at the detail of some of the rooms.\n\nThe monster and mutant skins are nothing special, except for the two giant ones you end up fighting, but I have a feeling they are going to release a few more enemies in the next episode.\n\nAgain, the faces on most of the characters look extremely realistic and in the very opening scene, you will notice an obvious feature that they added to one of the bad guys…or should I say bad girl.\n\nPros: Fast paced, inspired visuals from HL2, interesting story, check out all the hot chicks!\n\nCons: Only 3 weapons\n\nBottom Line: For $9.99 you will receive a fun, quick FPS shooter.  It's a bummer Ritual claimed they have 4-6 more hours of upcoming episodes, which were eventually canceled. The entire episode took  between 3-4 to complete.","January 21, 2014","true","2.2"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","6"

Unfortunately, it didn't sell enough to make a sequel. It recouped costs, but didn't even get near the jumping-off point they needed for EP2. So, Ritual was bought by MumboJumbo, a casual games outfit, and SiN is doomed to the aether of inexistence.\n\nOne of the most prolific devs, Levelord (A parallel Gabe if there was one) has entirely moved on* from the games industry and without his influence the odds are not a single peep will ever be heard again from SiN. Which is a shame, because it showed promise.\n\nA doomed sequel to a relatively unknown game that got clouded out by Quake 2 and Half-Life. Such a waste of potential that it died so soon.

Unfortunately this is the only Episode of this new chapter.\n\nSiN Episodes is an FPS based on Half-Life 2 Source engine, but while the phisycs ingame constantly provide some laughs for the usual odd and random "dead postures" I really missed one of the innovations from the first SiN: the armor system. But besides that the game is fine after all, there are cutscenes, a good music that follows and push the action (not to mention the Killer menu theme which I definitely love), the settings are very suggestive so we find the classic laboratories, sewers and now we see also a Dock, and a Huge building called "supremacy Tower". As usual there are a few minor bugs mostly temporary getting stuck between objects like chairs, or maybe gates that won't open because there are (or have been) some props over there. Nothing that a good jump or Checkpoint load can't solve.\nWhat this sequel miss in my humble opinion is the innovation of the first game, with ambience and computers interactions, the aforementioned armor system, stealth sections. This franchise had potential but it doesn't add anything particular or new to the genre. The story starts good, but the lack of explanations (supposedly postponed to a second episode that never came out) doesn't help much.\nThis doesn't mean this title is bad, I mean: it's well designed, it starts with a good story and all and even though this Episode lasted quite longer than I could have expected it doesn't bring any innovation like its predecessor did.\n\n\n+++PROs+++ STORY. A new chapter for this saga that moves on the story from the first title. Elexis is back and is planning with Radek, another criminal, some projects to take over the city, maybe the world. Yes, she's totally crazy, but she's a nice stereotype sometimes acting as the classic villain, sometimes acting impredictable.\nMUSIC. The ingame music doesn't really shine with any particular or recurrent theme but it follows and motivates the action sections. Unlike the main menu theme... Which I definitely love and listen even nowadays...\nLEVEL DESIGN. The levels present a beautiful setting and interior design (considering the engine, of course), and even though there are the usual kind of settings seen in the first title there are new and accurately designed locations.\nSiN. Together with Sin Episodes you get the original SiN!---CONs--- AI. The enemies actually are not a partcular threat. They run shooting at you and sometimes they look for cover... When they don't explode over their own granades...\nBUGS. Just few bugs, luckily but they're still here and there: personally I've got stuck between chairs, and later a gate refused to open because there are (or have been) some props over there. Still these are minor issues, as I got unstuck by insisting on jumping in all directions  and for the gate I've just loaded a close auto-checkpoint.\nLACK OF INNOVATION. Actually I've found this SiN Episode a common well designed FPS as there's no particular innovation unlike its predecessor which featured computer terminals interactions, the aforementioned armor system and stealth sections. And I know there are sections where you can move a platform and computers where there are some door controls but it's not the same as the original SiN as the terminals had more particular functions and easter eggs.\n\nSiN			* 7/10\nI remember being a huge fan of this game when videogames magazines with CDs full of demos were the thing. I'll be honest I just loved the Gun and the sniper rifle, their design was simply badass. However I've never been able to finish it, so when I found out that it came as a bonus with Sin Episodes: Emergence I thought it was a good chance to finish it once and for all... B-)\n\nSiN is a 1998 classic FPS based on the good old Quake II Engine. There are many little things that really hit me, both at the time and nowadays. The setting is the Freeport metropolis in a near future where police has been replaced by private security forces, which Blade (the protagonist) is part of. So we see modern/near future-like bank offices, laboratories, slums, sewers, a Dam and more. Besides the nice level design (especially for the times) there are some interesting elements like few drivable vehicles, usable computers with open-close commands and sometimes interesting prompt command menus, civilians and hostages which you need to save, a few stealth situations (optional, but still preferable). Still one of the most interesting and studied news is a well used Ghoul System, so now it actually matters shooting on a head or on legs. And that's not all because both you and enemies can wear bullet-proof protections and they are categorized according to the ghoul system, so you have helmet, jacket and pants which protect those parts. So As you shoot your enemies in different parts they might drop damaged vests. Very clever.\n\nThe story isn't much the strong side of the game: in the aforementioned Freeport thre's a criminality escalation. A dangerous drug named U4 is spreading in the streets and the game starts during a Bank heist we must stop. Our "gunned investigations" will bring us to linking U4 to a big corporation that is producing it. Like I said it's not the most original plot, but the gameplay is leading the way As well as some polygonal fan service...\n\n+++PROs+++ SETTINGS. The best thing of the game is obviously the setting. I like the levels, the situations, the weapons design (yes, I love them, don't ask why).\nINNOVATION. I have to say that there are some very interesting little things in the game that were not that frequent at the time. Like the simple but really effective direction in the introduction scene at the Bank heist, or other dialogues or small scenes. They were not great nor perfect, but they were a very good and nice attempt at something new. Plus the aforementioned vehicles, Ghoul and Armour system, Interactive computer interfaces. I know nowadays these don't have any value but I remember playing at the time, and I can contextualize these innovations. Though maybe this nostalgia might make me look not much objective.\nMUSIC. I wasn't going to include this, but there are a few themes here and there that are really astonishing. Jungle and Mansion are my favourite, of course.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY & ISSUES. Well, there's obviously no support nowadays and it would be of use because there's a low limited Resolution, the aspect ratio is 4:3, no adjustable brightness, there are some issues with movement and mouselook, and maybe even more. There are some solutions in the community but actually they made it worse. I've played in the classic resolution, 4:3 ratio, mouse was working fine and movement was overall responding with a few moments situations of misalignment. What makes me mad is that there's a DRM free version on GOG which I've read being adapted for modern systems... -.-\nOn the bright side there's a guide in the steam community that explains how to update the game. Unfortunately it doesn't fix any of these issues but looks like it was meant to fix worse bugs and problems.\nLOADING TIMES. They are ridiculously long, even on nowadays machines... -.-\nSTORY. The story is pretty simple, even if there are some interesting turning points that can give a change in the gameplay.\nWAGES OF SIN. Unfortunately there's no Expansion in the store (but there is in GOG... -.-) but if you own the old CD there's a way to make it work, reported in a guide in the Steam community. But unfortunately I couldn't test it because I don't have the original CD... :(","March 10","true","4.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

But the Half-Life series has some serious gameplay flaws - like being forced to complete platforming puzzles without being able to see your own feet, or constant reliance on those annoying and frustrating sandlions, and so on.\n\nThis is a Source engine game, and it plays very much like Half-Life 2, just without those glaring flaws that have become even more glaring over time.\n\nThis game holds up extremely well.  In the days of PhysX, its use of native Source engine physics is still impressive.  It's level design is consumate.  It's difficulty can be adjusted incredibly well.  The voice acting is as decent as you can expect from a game of its day.\n\nIndeed - and in a very real way - if you can look past the unfinished plot, you will see glimpses of gaming brilliance that, sadly, went unnoticed in its day, and largely still does.\n\nIf you have $9.99 and love shooters, this game is a must-have, especially now that nearly everyone has the tech in their rigs to max its settings to proper HD, enhance with proprietary GPU driver filters, and really enjoy the experience as the designers intended.\n\nThere are some flaws in the game itself, but bear in mind it was supposed to be the 1st of 9 episodes.  These flaws are an over-reliance on just one or two types of enemies, for example, and a few bugs in the AI that, understandably, never got patched.  Unfortunately, it is just plain tough to tell where the designers were going with enemy design and how these one or two basic enemies were going to relate to what may have come.\n\nAll of that said, just drop the tenner and get it.

I wonder if anybody can see / read my review of this game.\n\nSIN was an interesting FPS at the end of the '90s. It had a lot of scripted events and some really good action sequences. The game was also very difficult (or at least this is how I remember). I guess a lot of people played Half Life instead so perhaps not many gamers remember this title.\n\nEmergence meant to be a sequel but with the new Source engine developed by Valve. The creators wanted to release follow-up episodes but it seems Emergency was not successful enough for this to happen. It is a pity as the game is quite good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pikacommando/recommended/1300/","pikacommando","PikaCommando","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pikacommando/","289 products in account","Buy it just for the main menu song. The game is slightly worse than Unreal 2, but at least it comes with the original SiN too.\n\nIf you want it just for SiN, just buy SiN Gold from GOG.com instead. It comes with both SiN and Wages of SiN.\n\nHere's reviews for the entire SiN series anyway:\n\nSiN (1998)\n\nThe main game. It did many things that were groundbreaking for its time, but was overshadowed by Half-Life because it launched with tons of bugs that put people off, whom left for Half-Life and never touched SiN again. Even so, SiN's achievements are still unique in the history of FPS because what it did has not been replicated since; not even by Half-Life and its sequels.\n\nSuch amazing feats include the much-touted Action-Based Outcomes, where things you do in a level can affect what happens next. Like other old FPS, there's multiple ways to progress through a level, but unlike them, SiN does so in a much more interactive way, such as using computer terminals. You might even find secret sections or levels if you are observant. Other feats include an extremely versatile scripting system that allows things in the game to act in many awesome ways. It ranges from brush manipulation (vehicles, scenery destruction) to enemy tactics. While most games these days are heavily-scripted, none have done the ABO system like SiN did. Also, did I forget to mention this is the first FPS to feature in-engine cutscenes?\n\nEven without these feats, SiN still holds pretty well on its own. SiN features an engaging (if not cheesy) comic book-like character-driven story set in a dystopic city called Freeport where law enforcement is run by private security forces. The most respected one among all; HardCorps; is led by our hardcore and just hero, Colonel John R.(Rusty) Blade; who is assisted by his hacker sidekick, the geeky yet reliable J.C.; and together they must face the menace of evil Elexis Sinclaire, genius biochemist, self-proclaimed Mother Nature, and CEO of the corrupt multinational corporation; SinTek Industries. The story begins in the year 2037, when the highly addictive drug 'U4' (Dyforsanide) is at its peak and it's up to Blade and J.C. to stop Antonio Mancini, who seems to be behind the sudden outbreak of the drug, and find out the source of all the weird happenings around Freeport City lately.\n\nIt may not sound like much, but it's certainly more than what Half-Life has to offer (no, having the same plot as Doom but with things that are never explained does not constitute for a deep or good story). Blade is rocking the late 90s FPS hero attitude and his humorous back-and-forth snarks with J.C. keeps the characters interesting.\n\nAs for the technical aspects of the game; the graphics is about what you'd expect from a Quake 2 engine game, but it still holds up today and the scripting in the game may surprise you every now and then. The sound design may be a bit shoddy, but the music and voice acting is top-notch and spot-on. The levels are very well-designed; lifelike in the sense that you solve puzzles logically; and allows for endless replayability. The weapons may be standard and the enemies can be difficult at times, but the diverse cast of chatacters and environments will keep you interested until the end.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 9/10 due to technical shortcomings, but its innovations has certainly secured it a high rank on my list of great games.\n\n\nWages of SiN (1999)\n\nExpansion pack of the main game, brought to you by a small team of developers known as 2015, Inc. You may have known them for creating forgettable franchises later on such as Call of Duty, after most of the original team left the company to form Infinity Ward.\n\nNow, onto the actual game itself. Despite being an expansion pack with only 16 levels as opposed to the original's 36, it features a more cohesive experience than the main game. The pacing felt much better, and there was an interesting concept in the game where an action you took in one of the early levels decides the order and gameplay of the next several levels.\n\nSet several weeks after the events of SiN, the expansion pack continues the story with Blade combating the recent increase of mafia-related violence and how it all connects to the rise of the notorious mob boss, Gianni Manero.\n\nThe game did not change much from SiN, though it did introduce 7 new weapons and 10 new enemies. The new enemies aren't anything out of the ordinary, but the new weapons are far from the standard FPS-fare like the ones in the main game and are very fun to play with.\n\nOverall, it too gets a 9/10 and shares a seat with the main game.\n\n\nSiN: The Movie (2000)\n\nThis 1-hour OVA is a loose retelling of the events of the original game. Thus it features many discrepancies between it and the game.\n\nIts premise is mostly the same, but the plot develops differently. It's set in 2070, Blade is a cyborg, J.C. is replaced by his sister; Jennifer Armack; and they must stop Elexis from kidnapping a little girl or something.\n\nIt's your generic cheap ultra-gory 90s anime with forgettable plot. There's really nothing else to say about it.\n\nIt gets a 5/10.\n\n\nSiN Episodes: Emergence (2006)\n\nThe first and only Episode of a planned total of nine. The game is set in 2041. Elexis Sinclaire reemerged from the shadows and with the assistance of the elusive Viktor Radek, her ambitions still hasn't slowed down. After failing to prove the wrongdoings of Elexis and SinTek to the public, Blade returns to combat the threat together with his new sidekick Jessica Cannon, a hot-blooded but skilled rookie officer.\n\nBlade is a silent hero for some reason here. The new sidekick, Jessica, is basically Jennifer from the Movie; bland. As a result of that, we see less of J.C. in Emergence. Elexis is still her same old self. Radek plays the sane man to Elexis' crazy wench, but otherwise he's just an unremarkable lackey. Fun fact: Jessica and Radek are voiced by the actors of Cortana and Sergeant Johnson from Halo, respectively.\n\nUnlike the original SiN, everything it did here is completely outclassed by Half-Life in every single aspect. It's nothing like the original game at all; it instead is a discount Half-Life 2 to be point of running the same engine as HL2 does, and only features 3 weapons and a pitiful cast of enemies. The ABO that was featured in the original SiN is gone. The level design is nothing remarkable and the sound design, apart from the voice acting, is pretty standard and reuses some from HL2 itself.\n\nIt does, however, features a Dynamic Difficulty System. The goal of the system is to ensure no player will be stuck in the game or find it too easy. It works by constantly monitoring the player's actions, as well as its own decisions. Instead of altering the enemies health, damage, and speed like other games do, the game changes the difficulty in much more dynamic ways. For example, if the player scores headshots all the time, the next set of enemies you encounter will be equipped with helmets to protect them from headshots. If the player does not take much damage from combat, more enemies will appear and they will start using the weapons' alt-fire. Similarly, if the player is constantly low on health, killed enemies will drop medkits more often. On the other hand, if the player is still low on health all the time after that, the game will try something different to help you. While it sounds good on paper, in the end it doesn't even matter due to how short the game is.\n\nIn the end, this game; together with its fellow, 'Half-Life 2: Episodes'; is proof that the episodic format will never work. Sure, you can say it allows the devs to reuse assets in future episodes so they can focus on creating new stuff as well as providing a steady flow of content from beginning till the end, but it's all pointless if they do not have the tenacity, fundings, or workforce to back it up.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6/10.","January 11","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From the visual point of view it looks and feels like Half Life 2. Weapons, enemies, levels everything resembles a well-known Valve creation. However, it does not make Sin Episodes: Emergence a bad game, because the combat is addicting and fun. But, it takes around 3-4 hours to beat what is a real shame, and I wish Elexis Sinclaire had more time on the screen.

The game takes place in an already known to us from the previous game, John Blade who was imprisoned by Elexis Sinclaire his main opponent and her new assistant, Victor Radek SiNTEK in life sciences. Suddenly there is an explosion and a helper saves us a new Jessica Cannon. Lab starts to burn after Radek and Elexis flee. After leaving the labolatories we grab Radek and destroy his evil plans.\nMUSIC\nWhat a revelation to the music, the songs have a great listening sometimes even a little was left menu to listen to "What's the world come to" by Zak Bellic and Sarah Ravenscroft.\nGRAPHICS\nThe game runs on the familiar to us from Half-Life 2 Source engine and honestly the graphics look a little worse than in hl2 but it does the trick and is not bad :)\nPHYSICS\nAs for the physics that we see here is the same as in Half-Life 2, pick up objects, a perfect system of Ragdoll etc ...\nAI\nAs for the artificial intelligence of enemies and adversaries it looks a little different than in Half-Life which is better: the enemies of helping each other in need and throw various objects at us. As for the AI allies is the same as in Half-Life 2 which are immortal.\n\nCONS (-)\nLENGTH OF TRANSITION GAME\nThe game lasts somewhere so for a maximum of three hours of fun, this is a wine that the game had come out in 9 episodes and walked only one.\nNUMBER OF WEAPONS\nThe game features only three types of weapons. These are:\n-Magnum Pistol (is there an alternative shoot)\n-Shotgun (Has bullets bouncing off the walls)\n-Assault Rifle (firing a bomb)\n+ Grenades\n\nSUMMARY:\nIf you love the game for 3-4 hours is recommended, when you buy you will get also free the first part of the game, if the game is too short for you, I would not recommend. I personally liked the game in terms of climate which is better than the HL :)\n8/10","November 11, 2014","true","49.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

The game also shows many characteristics of other shooters in the era and has a stronge resemblence to Half-Life 2. You have a cutie girl follow you around multiple far off locations as you fight to defeat a big bad organization. Enemies are almost all human and toward the end of the game become increasingly strong in only how many bullets they can eat. Ammo is scarce and headshots are a must at many points. Interesting, the game "adapts" to your playing level, for example when you die in an area because there are too many enemies, when you return revived, there might be less, or they will be weaker. This is a nice feature to speed up play throughs but this is also somewhat insulting to players. Rather than this engine, it would have been nice if the player could just have been able to change diffultly ingame or betwen levels.\n\nNevertheless, this game is a real challange with eneimes towards the end, forcing you to make use of enviromental object to clear room after room of eneimes. This can get tiring and is very unrewarding. I felt some relief after completing it because I would never have to stress about how to use barrels, gas leaks and grenades to kill soldiers for the 40th time again.

For example, if you shoot down a billboard into the roof of a building below, it opens up a new entrance for the next level, otherwise, you'll have to shoot your way through the main entrance. Another example would be to turn a valve in one level, which floods an entire area in the next level, drowning a whole bunch of enemies.\n\nUnfortunately, Sin Episodes: Emergence is a poor attempt to be Half-Life 2: Episode 3, you follow a scripted linear path, kicking ♥♥♥ with your female sidekick. It's fun, but not very inspired.\n\nAdditionally to the solo campaign, there is a survival mode, which is totally pointless since there's no leaderboards and you can't play in coop.\n\nThe SDK includes the level editor Hammer, but there's no option to create a mod (and therefore no source code is available).\n\n\nNote that there won't ever be another Sin or Sin Episode. Also when you buy Sin Episodes: Emergence, you get the game Sin as well (except for buyers in Germany!).

I never played SiN Episodes: Emergence, since I hadn't heard anything about it when it was released, and afterwards, I only heard bad things about it.\n\nFrankly, I don't understand why this series receives so little attention, and so much negativity. SiN Episodes: Emergence has a splendid soundtrack, a very immersive set of environments, arguably better gameplay than most games from its era (Half-Life 2, Call of Duty 2, etc.), competent AI (appropriate use of cover, grenades, flanking, etc.) and a story I'd love to see completed.\n\nSadly, I cannot say I recommend this series. Not because the games are bad, but because neither of them really have a place in the modern world. SiN has such a steep difficulty curve that it will put off most modern gamers and SiN Episodes: Emergence is merely an introductory chapter to what was supposed to be a game series comprised of nine episodes.\n\nIt's a damn shame this series of games was never completed.\n\n\n","March 1, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

There I said it.\n\nWhat's the world come to? Where episodic games on the Source Engine go the way of the gun. The game is not very good what with the poor level design and boring visuals. It's a sin that there's so little content across the board BLADE! (That and the game has super awkward (unsexy) female designs that objectify them in the worst most pre teen way possible.) I'm no prude but when a game gives you the opposite of a boner as you groan and look over your shoulder to see if anyone has somehow been watching you silently, judging you the whole time as they shake their head then you know something is wrong and that you should call your family and say you love them.\n\nObviously the creators of an engine know how best to use it but it's shocking that a game can look this BAD on the Source engine a whole two years after Half-Life 2 was released. People are wayyyy smaller than doors and all the original art assets (Non HL2 props.) look too large or cartoony to match the world around them which already looks horrible. The character designs are inconsistant,uninspired,dull and basically look like the one artist on staff gave up and put whatever he could on the screen to get paid and go home (I feel his pain). The story and voice acting is also awful which helps make and add to the "♥♥♥♥ WE GOTTA SHIP SOMETHING GRAB THE INTERN" feel that the game may have been going for. Worse yet is it's AI which is so badly bugged to hell even after a suppossed patch (Did they not even shoot their guns before?) that it should get a world record or something.\n\nThe grunts (I don't remeber their names which is funny because they certainly know yours BLADE.) are probably the dumbest AI I ever have and ever will see. They often kill their own men and blow them selves up when they aren't piling up in front of  a door ,facing the wrong way,failing to use cover,getting stuck or literally jumping on top of massive piles of their own men killing themselves in the process. YES I ♥♥♥♥ you not they will get stuck on the massive piles of corpses that stack up when you camp certain spots that infinitley respawn them. Better yet sometimes after you shoot them or they shoot you they will instantly forget that they have ever seen you actually saying things like "Damn it I know he's here somewhere!".\n\nBut wait, THERES MORE! While they are smart enough to use hand gestures to coordinate with their team they aren't smart enough to know how or when the right time to use them is. They often will get killed because instead of shooting you they start waving. Sometimes they will send waves of themselves to their doom by asking other grunts to use steps or to walk twoards piles of explosives that they themselves will shoot and be killed by. Oh and you see that screenshot of a soldier behind boxes on the store page? That poor ♥♥♥♥er is stuck. Most of the time unless you are forced to kill everyone to progress you can juts walk past the enemies as they say something unintentionally hilarious like "You'll never get past me BLADE!" before setting themselves on fire in the background. The final thing I noticed was that sometimes the AI will ♥♥♥♥ up so badly that you'll enter a room after a quick save just to find they've saved you the trouble of shooting them by killing themselves in some sort of amazing manor leaving you awestruck as you try to figure out how they killed themselves this time.\n\nThe plot and characters are also awful and forgetable. The stupid grunts are the most memorable thing in the game as their stupidy has stuck with me even after all this time. I remember one enemy stuck in the ceiling with a jetpack. Another walked away slowly his back turned to me as I killed everyone around him. One said "Nice try Blade!" before getting killed by his teamate who promptly got stuck on a door. One man stared at me without shooting and did nothing even when I shot at it. The smartest thing I saw someone do was take cover behind a pipe and try to shoot me. But alas he could only hit the wall and I walked behind  him and watched as he shot the wall and ignored me. EVEN the mutants (Spoilers I guess.) get stuck on small bumps I ♥♥♥♥ you not. Even though many are the height of the player when crouching they absolutley CANNOT walk and or fit through the pipes and other small areas that they are DEFINITLEY intended to.\n\nWhen you tally up all of it's problems it's almost so embarrassing that if for no other reason it may be worth a picking up for a laugh if nothing else interesting is steeply discounted. It's extremely short as I beat it in 2 hours my first time through on the highest difficulty. It will be remembered as that game you didn't own that had a check box in Garrys Mod 9, it's main theme and bankrupting it's developer which is actually kind of sad. This is game is the Yang to Half-Life 2's Yin and this review is the longest I've ever done.

I actually had to redownload and "play" the game for five minutes to review because back then they didn't track time played on Steam.\nIt's a really solid game. The music is good and the Personal Challenge System that makes the game harder to match the player skill is a really cool idea and works well (on release there was a bug that would cause the game to become harder and harder which is hilarious but that was patched sometime in 2006). However, it turned out it didn't sell well enough to get any sequels. rip\nVerdict: Don't buy it unless it's like a dollar because it's part one of a series that will never be completed.

It has generic characters, gameplay and was actually planned out to be a series of 9 episodes. When the first didn't sell well they canned the whole project.\n\nIn general Emergence reminds me a lot of early Source engine games like Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, Dark Messiah etc. In that they are fairly easy to run today but don't look all that inspiring. SiN plays like a Quake-esque mod for Half Life 2, which was one of my first thoughts playing it.\n\nThe one redeeming quality about this game was it's much hyped "Arena" mode. Which was superficially based on Max Payne 2's Dead Man Walking mode. In it, you run around surviving against endless waves of enemies whilst the difficulty dynamically shifts depending on how well your doing. Ala, Godhand. However there's only a handful of maps available, most of which are garbage.\n\nI bought this game for less then 4$ on a Steam sale and it's probably worth that much honestly. It's not too impressive and doesn't capture the appeal of the Source engine.","January 2, 2013","false","1.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

It was six more minutes until after school. As he was doing his homework, something caught his eye.\n\nHis desk was next to the window, and he turned and looked to the grass outside. It looked like a picture. When school was over, he ran to the spot where he saw it. He ran fast so that no one else could grab it.\n\nHe picked it up and smiled. It had a picture of the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. She had a dress with tights on and red shoes, and her hand was formed into a peace sign.\n\nShe was so beautiful he wanted to meet her, so he ran all over the school and asked everyone if they knew her or have ever seen her before. But everyone he asked said "No." He was devastated.\n\nWhen he was home, he asked his older sister if she knew the girl, but unfortunately she also said "No." It was very late, so Tom walked up the stairs, placed the picture on his bedside table and went to sleep.\n\nIn the middle of the night Tom was awakened by a tap on his window. It was like a nail tapping. He got scared. After the tapping he heard a giggle. He saw a shadow near his window, so he got out of his bed, walked toward his window, opened it up and followed the giggling. By the time he reached it, it was gone.\n\nThe next day again he asked his neighbors if they knew her. Everybody said, "Sorry, no." When his mother came home he even asked her if she knew her. She said "No." He went to his room, placed the picture on his desk and fell asleep.\n\nOnce again he was awakened by a tapping. He took the picture and followed the giggling. He walked across the road, when suddenly he got hit by a car. He was dead with the picture in his hand.\n\nThe driver got out of the car and tried to help him, but it was too late.

I have finished both games, but that was before "the great reset of play time counters" some years ago.\n\nSiN:\n\nAn interesting game which had the misfortune of being released round about the same time as Half-Life. It also had the misfortune of being absolutely full of bugs which were only fixed with a huge (30Mb+) downloadable patch, at a time when most people only had dial-up connections. It had an interesting story, and very well designed levels, where actions performed in one map would affect those later on in the game. Many missions had several ways in which they could be solved. Well worth a play if you get the chance.\n\nSiN Episodes: Emergence:\n\nThe first game I ever played which used the Source engine that wasn't made by Valve. Excellent graphics and sound, wonderful level design and pretty good AI. Brilliant, but unfortunately the creators sold the company to people who seem only interested in shoveling casual games on people, so we'll probably never see a sequel. Shame. It's not terribly original and you'll finish it in about three hours, but it is a lot of fun.","March 16, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't enjoy the demo of the original game much, but I was thinking more modern FPS design would help fix it! And I was pleasantly surprised. This is a leaner, shorter version of SIN without all the tedious level design (well, significantly less tedious anyway.) The scripted sequences are nice and it is fun to shoot the dudes in the head with your pistol. It's not much and it lasts about four hours, plus you're never going to ever get a sequel with this. Given all that, though, the work they must have put into this game and their subsequent closing down was the bellwether for the failure of the episodic model - too much work for too little payoff (and profit).

SiN and SiN Episodes: Emergence, since SiN is bundeld with Emergence(even though the steam page doesn't show it, you actually get SiN with it).although I will be mainly talking about SiN.\n\nSiN Episodes: Emergence is the sequel to the original SiN, unfortuenately this is the first and last episode in a planned seven episode series, so this game is short and is also sadly the last SiN game.\nThe game is a big departure from the original game, first of all your character John. R Blade, because now he is a silent protagonist, this wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't his speech and acts that made him great, instead your new sidekick (aka: Alex Vance ripoff): Jessica gets all the chararistics, as for me seeing this was like a slap in the face Blade didn't feel like a badass anymore he is now an empty shell. The second big problems is that the levels felt really linear, there is no paths or decisions that alter the game world like in the original game, you also spend more time in crammed corridors than in big areas like in any other game. The last things wrong about this game is the overall feel, right off the get go if you look at any gameplay footage you'll think this is a Half-Life 2 mod, because Emergence looks unappealing from the bad texture work(which steals most textures and lanscapes from HL2) and the bad animations, characters mostly just move their mouth up and down it's nowhere near as good as Half-Life 2. Last thing to mention is that this game can be repetetive to a lot of people as there is only three weapons, four enemy types in the whole game(being two different grunts and two different mutants)and mostly you are just mowing down enemys, unlike its predecessor which had a lot more!\n\nBut enough about my rambiling on how bad this game is, surely there is some redeaming quality about it right? Well yes, there is. The pistol and shotgun feel nice and pumpy, the music is great same goes with the voice acting and it all just feels great.\n","September 1, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't enjoy the demo of the original game much, but I was thinking more modern FPS design would help fix it! And I was pleasantly surprised. This is a leaner, shorter version of SIN without all the tedious level design (well, significantly less tedious anyway.) The scripted sequences are nice and it is fun to shoot the dudes in the head with your pistol. It's not much and it lasts about four hours, plus you're never going to ever get a sequel with this. Given all that, though, the work they must have put into this game and their subsequent closing down was the bellwether for the failure of the episodic model - too much work for too little payoff (and profit). Still, it's worth a playthrough.","December 15, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

And since developers wanted this to be in episodes, the game ends before if even started.\n\nStill, the game works, and it features some interesting characters, design wise if nothing else.

AND THEY DID. the only problem is that its an episodic game and  lasts 3 hours max. but I do want to see the rest of the story. weapons are unique and grounded, graphics are good, and Ai is decent (early source Ai). this is a great game and should be played even if it is like 3 hours long.\n\n7.5/10","December 24, 2011","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There certainly wasn't lack of trying with Elexis/Jessica photoshoot pictures and ARG. Graphics are still quite good, considering the age of game and levels are tunnels, I guess this could still be called as guilty pleasure game - it doesn't last that long that playing through feels like chore and there are enough changes in scenery. As some other reviewers stated also, wish there was sequel made if not for any other reason than to finish the story.\n\nBut why has Blade turned mute on this game?

I grew up playing the old game, which I loved, so I had high hopes for this new installment. Sadly, the game lacks a bit of originality gameplay wise, as it copies Half-Life's source engine, it just feels like it's a copy and paste job, just different skin. And since developers wanted this to be in episodes, the game ends before if even started.\n\nStill, the game works, and it features some interesting characters, design wise if nothing else. Sin still has one of the most hottest female villains around, Elexis, now modeled after adult model Bianca Beauchamp. All in all if you aren't expecting much and want an oldie shooter, there is some fun to be have here.","June 23, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I´m done. I´ve played all the maps(story i mean), fanmade, Sin 1 Source maps, EVERYTHING. (those all i could find and download). I examined every place in all maps totally. So the fun would not end.\n\nPositive things about this game:\n\n-AI, so much better than in any other source game, enemies can get wounded, and can´t move, just noticed that in last map  i played, they kick things at you, shoots exploding barrels (and maybe kick them towards you after that), they can melee better, using head example, they throw your grenades back to you(i think, i´m not sure about this one) and they can get health from healthstations example. So it´s more challangening to fight them.\n\n-Maps, so much colours. I love it. They world its self is gorgeous.\n\n-Characters, Omg ur sidekick and main enemy *_*, characters are too very colourful and have great personalities. And other enemies etc. are funny as ♥♥♥♥. Mutants too are awsome. Like that hulk/tank, holy ♥♥♥♥ it´s terrifying, in a good way. And ohohhohooo holy ♥♥♥♥ i bursted to laugh with jetpack soldiers.\n\n-Arcade mode (it´s like survival but you need to surivive example: 15 mins of \"horde\"), damn, i had so much fun. I made two gameplay videos of those, Official and un-official map gameplays. Vertigo is best of them all. And fanmaps are awsome too.\n\n-Tiny bit of horror. That mutant part. I was terrifyed a bit.\n\n-Guns with specialists. Damn i had fun with those bouncing shotgun bullets, those were helpful in many ways.\n\n-HARDCORPS-mode, and that one, is hard. It is just like Outlast´s INSANE-mode.\n\n-Soundtrack, i love mostly the last boss fight song, games theme and it´s remix. One of the best themes in gaming universe.\n\n-Insane bunnyhopping\n\n-You can shoot trough the walls, obstacles etc. Like CSGO. AI is clever to do that too.\n\n-Many funny secrets and easter eggs\n\nNegative things about this game:\n\n-Movement, you move so ♥♥♥♥ing slow, and even sprint-jumping somewhere does not succeed very well sometimes.\n\n-Only 3 guns+melee+stupidly generated shotgun ironsight\n\n-Short game, it´s like 2 hours to 6 hours(if its new player playing)\n\n-Sometimes, AI´s melee is too OP\n\n-New game menu, like how do i know whatkind of difficulty i get while adjusting that difficulty. (see for urself and u know what i mean)\n\n-Dissapointing ending.\n\n-That tankhulk eats ur ammunition.\n\n-No multiplayer support. (like there is no multiplayer at all, and it would have been great with arcade maps, or/with survival style)\n\n-When you buy this, you will receive extra copy of Sin 1+Sin 1 MP, but Sin 1 is broken and multiplayer has no players and Sin 1 does NOT HAVE expansion pack (that is the real ending in that expansion.. buy this game for GOG if u want best version)\n\n-Blade is more silent in this one.. ;_;\n\nNow i want to say that this has been a great experience and i will not forget it. I will play this once again if this ever get revived. Last time i played this was 6 years ago and this was my second playthrough. And this game is 10 YEARS OLD NOW, has been for awhile. People has been in cliffhanger for 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years. Yes i know why. Don´t tell me then. I still hope they come back and revive this series ;_; we need EP2 ASAP.\n\nI highly recommend this for people who misses good old FPS style like HL2, CSS, COD(okay cod just came to my mind because that greanade throwing thingy and shooting through walls etc and meaning, time before EXO ♥♥♥♥ etc..) So this is perfect game for these kind of people, trust me, you will not be dissapointed.\n\nOverall rating 8/10","June 1","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
