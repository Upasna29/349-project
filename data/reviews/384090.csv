"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/384090/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSketch Tales is based on a brilliant idea - a sandbox RPG where you can draw, animate and even voice things while in-game.\n\nBut you can completely ignore that, if you wish. There's fun to be had no matter how you approach the game - landscapes designed for exploration, quests to find and perform, structures to build, beasts to kill and loot to hunt.\n\nI spent my first hour just wandering around in confusion with a goofy grin. I was chased by enemies who muttered daft things at me or played the harmonica. I laughed as I killed something whose body span comically down the hill. I picked up a quest from an NPC who then randomly wandered off to fight a ninja. The whole thing is a living, breathing cartoon that oozes charm.\n\nMy "blind let's play" video of my first game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eqT1-DvBbw\n\nYou'll need to consider a few things before buying the game close to the early access release date:\n\n1. Early Access here means that - it's very early days yet. There's lots to things to do, but not much depth. Just exploring the one island won't take long, but you can spend as much time as you want building and drawing etc.\n\n2. The drawing element is essentially an in-game paint programme, with the ability to add basic animation frames if you want. Right now you can edit/draw anything you're holding in your inventory (if you have picked up the Witch Brush), plus you get to draw your character when you first start playing.\n\n3. There'll be bugs - unoptimised graphics, a couple of  spelling mistakes, features that don't seem to work - but they'll get fixed. No full crashes, but did have to reload quite a bit to clear any built-up lag, though.\n\n4. The building isn't as intuitive as Minecraft, with (simple) menus to select shapes and so on, but once you get the hang of it you can build blocky structures easily. You can alter the default cube to stuff like ramps, arches and flat bits too.\n\n5. You don't get given all the building/colouring tools at the start - you need to go out and find them in the world on scrolls. Plus, everything you build requires energy, which uses up very fast and then slowly fills back up again. You can find items that increase your max energy, but at the start of the game you're very limited (This applies to story mode - I don't know yet if sandbox mode will have this limitation).\n\n6. Fighting is very basic. You start with fists but I recommend finding an axe!\n\nSketch Tales is already a lot of fun and shows amazing potential but right now it's very rough around the edges. I recommend it, but I'm most interested in what's to come. Multiplayer, when it happens, should be a riot.\n\n* More Sketch Tales videos\n* More Randomise User indie game videos\n\nThanks to the developers for providing a pre-release version for review.","September 28, 2015","true","7.3"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","54","61","4","1"

What you're actually buying is probably the chance to buy it for a cheap price while its still empty. Game is buggy as my virus filled laptop and you start off without any knowledge of what to do and how to do it. There are little tips here and there and also a vague tutorial but thats about it. At the moment I'd rate it a 2/10 but its got the potential to be a 9/10.\n\nWould I recommend it now as a game that can be played? Nope. Its Empty and Lonely. Although, If you're like me and like the concept of this game, go ahead and buy it! Support the game and give the devs some inspiration by showing them that people like their idea and want to see it to its fullest. Would I recommend it to people who are active in game development forums and want to help develop the game by simply buying it? Of Course I would!","September 29, 2015","true","2.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I also lost myself during my character creation of a tailless Lizard man & I loved the ridiculously animated outcome. It works well with its simplistic graphics, the cute mousy voice overs & the eccentric lighthearted humor.\nDaily updates & bug fixes of this early access game keep me coming back as well. It just goes to show you that you don't always need triple A graphics & millions of dollars to showcase true work of art.  I highly recommend this delightful game.","October 1, 2015","true","2.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Sketch Tales is the game that will give you this possibility.\n\nNot many people have already noticed this piece of art but soon they will! About it, simply think about a survival game, make it 2D and very personalizable, in fact you can draw your character, your enemies and build their stories!\n\nAlso the trasformation of a 3D world in 2D is something completely new which will deserve your love. Very fun to play and very well done, the idea behind it is amazing. At the moment some bugs are there, but you can't really wait for them to be fixed to buy this game straight away, for the price it is served at it is an absolute Must Have!\n\nI am looking forward confident of the success of this game, which will make this the next big Survival, EA, Open World game.\n\nA specific word for the crafting and building system which work magnificently and it is already as good as RUST's one (RUST the survival game)!\n\nVideogame Score: 9.0 | ULTRA RECOMMENDED","October 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Thing is I couldn't even finish to paint a character.\nAnd then tested in game and got stuck in my inventory menu directly. I love the theme of the game and the Idéa but right now it isn't playable so im actually quite surprised that it is in early access already.\n\nAnyways it is good to support this game if they will work on with it and finish it because it is a unpolished Diamond.\nBut it is incredibly hard to play it as it is now. I hope they will work hard with it so I can enjoy play this and do my own creations!

Sketch Tales is reminiscent of Minecraft in a stylistic sense. Where Minecraft is a blocky, basic but charming 3D Game; Sketch is a crudely drawn but just as lovable 2D World (for the most part, some things however such as blocks exist as 3D Elements which creates for a trippy contrast. My only real issue with the game right now would be a lack of a tutorial.

It is strongly influenced by minecraft and dont starve. But the special twist in it makes it unique.\nMy graphic tablets work perfectly in there too, which adds to the magic.\n\nThere is something you may not have seen in it as a very unique potential. It could be a good ''first step'' to graphic tablets for younger people or newcomers to the digital art scene. As a father of 4 kids and as an illustration and 3d modeling artist, I totally see this game becoming huge in my household, and a perfect way to break the ice with graphic tablets for my kids. They will enjoy it and who knows, maybe want to go further using it.\n\nThis game also has a potential to be a new hype in schools, just like minecraft did. Bring it to tablets and im pretty sure you will find a solid audience.\n\nKeep on working hard :-)","January 14","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Очень раннем доступе.\n\nЯ могу порекомендовать эту игру если вы хотите чего-то необычного.\nСамое необычное в игре это возможность полностью с нуля нарисовать, анимировать и озвучить своего персонажа. И даже не персонажа, а вообще почти любой игровой предмет. Внутриигровой редактор более чем функционален, на мелкие недоработки можно закрыть глаза.\n\nВ том что касается первого впечатления от самой игры, то это как будто Minecraft смешали с Don't Starve.\nНо поскольку это "ранний доступ" геймплея как такого особо не наблюдается, сейчас это просто разрозненные локации, персонажи и задания. И судя по форуму создатели еще сами не определились, что за игру они хотят сделать.\nА учетом с текущего прогресса и размера команды я подозреваю, что работа над окончательным вариантом игры затянется на долгие годы, как это и было с вышеупомянутыми  Minecraft и  Don't Starve.\n\nТак что если вы хотите поддержать разработчиков оригинальной игры или любите рисовать и анимировать, то можете смело покупать эту игру.
