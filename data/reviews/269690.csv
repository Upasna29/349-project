Each has different goals but all involving trekking across space looking for things and not crashing into a sun. It's full of random items to find and is procedurally generated afresh each time you play.\n\nIt begins in chapter 1 as a laid-back, lonely search for a home planet. Your spaceship follows a compass sentry around the galaxy while raiding derelicts to keep your resources stocked.\n\nYou pass through different biomes in space, each colour-themed, and each spawning different kinds of dangers (and rewards). You can't shoot, but you can dodge enemies and hyperspace away.\n\nRaiding derelicts is mostly just a button press that may lead to gaining stuff, losing stuff or a mixture of both. Sometimes there's a choice to make.\n\nAs a roguelike it does have permadeath. If you die, you'll need to spend money to buy a decent new ship, although a lot of stuff does carry over: You keep money, XP and any ship upgrades you found. In chapter one, death also means losing your mission progress.\n\n[Mild spoilers ahead]\n\nOnce you've completed chapter 1, things get more complex. Chapter 2 forces you to explore the galaxy unguided - you need to locate raw material and take it back to your home planet to push the story on and earn ship bonuses. Not being led around by the nose makes this for a satisfying contrast to the first chapter - and if you die, you're allowed to keep all the progress you've made with your home planet. But you still need a new ship.\n\nOnce you finish upgrading that planet, you unlock chapter 3, where the difficulty increases and you have several types of missions to complete instead of one. This chapter introduces different, harder biomes mostly full of things that can hurt you. There are also boss fights!\n\nI won't spoil the boss fights, but be prepared to have to outthink the bosses without being able to directly attack them.\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05PxR3uxPQM&index=1&list=PLLvo6-XrH1fnsN8fLgVYT1IQ36JcWG4J9\n\nGood & bad stuff:\n\n* The story, atmosphere and graphic style are excellent. It all fits together perfectly. Just be prepared to fiddle with the gfx settings, the scanlines etc aren't for everyone.\n\n* Be prepared for gnomic poetry floating in space and pop-up ship logs about loneliness. If you find this sort of thing annoying, you're out of luck.\n\n* You do have a choice of up to 8 different ships to start out in, but you have to pay for most of them. New players may find a vicious circle that when they're doing badly, they'll only have a weak ship to use and will find it hard to grind to get money.\n\n* Most ship upgrades you find in space only fit to one type of ship, so you can end up with an inventory full of stuff mostly useless to your current game. Luckily, you can earn new items by scrapping a lot of old ones.\n\n* It's not always clear why the choice you made in some dialogue boxes result in a "good" or "bad" outcome, which can lead to the occasional death that feels unfair.\n\n* It's a great game for lore hunters and collectible finders. There are legendary items and unique randomly generated items to find, lots of achievements, collectible logs, and items that increase your luck and make hunting easier. You can even personalise your ship with styles, once you've found them.","August 20, 2015","true","8.7"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","46","52","0","2"

Some people may say that that amount of time cannot give a game a fair shake I think it can. I made it about 5 minutes into chapter 3.\n\nPros:\n- The music is wonderful and quite relaxing for my tastes.\n\nMiddle of the road:\n- The visuals are decent. While I found the background and resource collection objects unique and very well done, but your ship and floating resources were very crude and uninspiring.\n- The voice asset in the game were in my mind very well done. I do not know if it is a fully synthesized voice or if they had someone reading lines and then ran it through a mixing board.  That being said the actual dialogue/diaries entries were written like a 16 year old trying to be deep, like Jayden Smith's Twitter deep. Some will find it endearing, I do not.\n\nCons:\n- The game-play just feels mediocre to me. All I have to do click in the direction that I want my ship to go, dodge some obstacles and that is it. But that is all you need right? In my mind no. A person needs challenged, they need to be drawn into the experience. There is no depth with this game-play. I feel that they could have done much more with the IP they created.\n\nI think I can see what they were trying to do here and I applaud them for their efforts. This game is not my cup of tea, but it may be yours. Give it try if you feel that the points I brought up are not important for your experience.","August 21, 2015","false","2.2"," 231 of 347 people (67%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","67","231","347","17","12"

Soon you start to realize that your are probably the only human left alive, and that there is a little chance that you will find a new home in the ‘Big empty’. As years go by and your resources run low, so does your psyche, burdening you with moral doubts and at times deep poetic conclusions.\n\nSeparated in a three unique chapters, each having a different premise, Rymdresa feels and acts like a true space odyssey. As space you travel through is procedurally generated by means of y and x axis there are literally no bounds to where and how far you can go, and for how long you can try to survive.\n\nAs in any rogue-like game, the basics are difficult to master and take a bit of time to get used to. You gather resources scavenging through celestial bodies and abandoned spacecrafts or picking up particles of astral dust. Well, it’s not exploration as it first comes to mind, as you just need to get close to the objects and click the explore button.\n\nThere are many different upgrades that you can apply to your spacecrafts; maybe you want your shields to be of a higher capacity so you can take a more rigorous punch from space debris or hostile UFOs, or maybe you want more powerful engine to cover more distance faster, or, maybe you just want a whole new ship with different preferences altogether. The RPG-ish style of your inventory immediately lets you know that there is huge amount of upgrades available.\n\nWeapons are permanently offline as there is no combat in RymdResa, and i’m really glad there isn’t any, because the omnipresent melancholic atmosphere is just as perfect as it is. Actually that’s the thing that stroke me the most from the very start of my adventure. That strange, even bizarre feeling of loneliness and complete separation from some kind of a illusionary safe-zone.\n\nRymdResa is the most tranquil space rogue-like you will ever play, but so unforgiving at times. With it's unique twist on space exploration and rogue-like features it somehow manages to separate itself from other space exploring titles.\n\nDisclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes only\n\nFULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]","October 19, 2015","true","17.5"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

The strange poetic writing, the minimal graphical style, the frictionless navigation of space, and a soundtrack that felt unsettling did little to impress me, until I gave myself over to the experience. This is not a game that will fling obstacles at you, floating through the void of space you will maneuver through planets, asteroids, and satellites in search of resources. RymdResa’s soundtrack slowly won me, as the empty loneliness of space dawned on me. Is RymdResa truly a barren void? Or are there treasures under the surface? It’s time to experience RymdResa.\n\nThe most interesting thing in RymdResa is the differing gameplay modes between the three chapters. The first chapter leads you around by the nose, to 9 random points where you will collect “resources” and “spacepoints”. The second introduces the idea of a home planet, where you will drag a third currency called “materials” which will be used to build 9 upgrades. Finally, the third chapter smashes all of your prior experience into what really feels like the pinnacle of the game. There are boss fights and endless peril, and it is the only part of RymdResa that feels like a true game.\n\nA choice was made between brutalizing the gamer into the ground, or forcing a couple of chapters where you are able to learn through doing in a relaxed environment. Both choices are correct, but the latter is a bit more enjoyable, at least on the surface. The endorphin-rush was considerably less. You must learn the delicate dance of space! Resources will keep your ship afloat and powered, spacepoints will let you buy upgraded ships with a variety of special abilities. From the turtle I used in my review video to an insanely-accelerating racer craft, the variety of ships available is sure to keep you coming back for more. Level-ups will carry over through death, so you will slowly power up your craft and realize your true potential.\n\nRymdResa is a beauty of a game with tons of items, ships, and customization. The music gets a little eerie at times, but then you look at the void and realize it should feel strange. The lo-fi graphical choice is still not my favorite, but doesn’t truly matter. While I never find myself overly-invested or absorbed in the gameplay, I find myself endlessly wanting to explore that next corner of untouched space. Huge congratulations to Morgondag on a game that is getting a good amount of attentions, for very valid reasons. Thanks so much for the review copy! I plan to revisit this one in my personal time quite soon.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 10/10\nFun Factor- 5/10\nDifficulty- 6/10\nReplayability- 9/10\nInnovation- 8/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 6/10\nMusic- 9/10\nSound FX- 8/10\nStory/Lore- 7/10\nLevel Design- 8/10\n\nFinal Score: 76/100 for replayability, controls, and music.\nSummary: Casual spaceship roguelike offering tons of items, ships, and obstacles.\nVerdict: If you like space, RymdResa will easily keep you occupied for hours.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-rymdresa/\n"Lets Review" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkpuBd1wCnE","August 23, 2015","true","2.4"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","35","42","0","0"

This is absolutely true... but it is actually so much more.  It's pixilated poetry.  It's 2015: A Space Awesomity.  It's the game I didn't know I had been waiting for and I get sad when I think about the possibility that I'd have missed it.\n\nIt's a tale of a destroyed Earth and mankind's last hope to colonize a new world.  It won't be an easy journey, and like all epic journeys, there is a heavy price that is paid by our lone cosmonaut. Its told in a simple and effective way via space diaries and it builds an intricate background narrative as you play the game.  Nothing is jammed down your throat in RymdResa.\n\nLike Asteroids without the lasers; this game is an excellent example that not every game needs violence/combat to be fun and meaningful. That isn't to say that you are totally defenseless; sharp reflexes and some fun items will go a long way in increasing your survivability.\n\nGameplay:\n\nProcedural World - Exploration is the name of the game and each run is going to be a little different.  Not just in the position of the neat things you'll discover in the vastness of space but each for the 3 Chapters has a different approach to exploration that helps mix things up.\n\n8 Different Ships - After you beat Chapter 1 with your first ship you'll get many options of new vessels to buy for your next run.  They use starpoints but you'll have plenty to spend on the craft that best suits your playstyle.  You want a tanky Vanadis or maybe a speedy Skadi Cruiser? Or spend a ton of points for the dominating Ragnarok you just unlocked? It's up to your play style; they all have pros and cons and it's a lot of fun taking them all out for a spin.  Some items you collect are ship-specific so putting new gear on your new ride is just gravy.\n\nGetting Around - Finding a new world to inhabit will not be easy.  Numerous obstacles will keep your ship from good happy success: Asteroids and debris will try to damage your ship, red mines litter the galaxy, huge gravity-rich suns will pull you towards a fiery & instant death, and, just like a true rogue-like, if you interact with a random planet and it penalizes you too many resources you are going to have to start over.  Luckily your ship comes equipped with a sentry that points you in the direction of my main objective keeping you in the action instead of needing to use a map.  There are also scattered stars you will come across that give you star points & XP that you can spend on new ships and such.\n\nResource Management - Resources are scarce and essential to your success.  They also act as your life bar and your fuel; you run out and your journey is over.  A lot of the game is stumbling across a moon or derelict spaceship and interacting with it to have an outcome.  Usually your get star points XP) and resources but a bad roll of the RNG and you may lose resources instead.  You also may fail to explore altogether!  This process is all done with a single key press and is a seamless, quick way to try your luck and keep the action moving forward.\n\nLeveling Up and Skills - Pilot level as you fly through space, survive each year, find random spacedust and complete objectives you'll be gaining Pilot XP to advance your four basic skills;  Exploration (more positive outcomes), Scouring (more items), Technology (allows you to tap into alien technology found randomly in space) and Survival (more found resources)\n\nThese skills, your level and your ship's inventory carry over to new playthroughs so it gives you a feeling that even a bad run is contributing to a better playthrough next time making this a great game for rogue like fans who are less brutal (perma-death may be available in future updates).\n\nDeath -  Dying isn't the end on RymdResa.  So you flew directly into a huge sun on accident, your run will be over and you'll need to purchase a new ship next time but you'll usually be in a better position to win next time around as you keep your levels, skills, inventory and star points.  Still, the fun is playing to win!\n\nGraphics:\n\nRymdResa is a fantastic looking pixel game.  While your ships are fairly simple in shape it helps keep you focused on the amazing style of space exploration.  While space feels as vast and empty as you'd expect that makes the various satellites, moons and spaceships you encounter all the more interesting.  I was always admiring how cool some new thing I stumbled upon looked.  Everything is in a muted bluish color (except those friggin' suns) that just makes perfect sense. Really beautiful stuff, all around.\n\nBut your spaceships being simple in shape doesn't mean that there aren't a sizable number of fun customization/styles you can find and equip to tweak your look slightly. Its not overwhelming but nice to have as it make you feel like your ship gets better visually as well as stat-wise.\n\nSound:\n\nFX: The sound effects are just fine, the sounds of thrusters, alerts and taking damage all work well.\n\nMusic:  By Tom Croke and Pat Jacobs, the music in RymdResa is an excellent fit for the atmosphere.  Spacey, industrial, everything you ever would want without being too abrasive and getting on your nerves.  The music does a fantastic job of setting the mood.  Space is haunting, lonely and dangerous.\n\nVoice Acting: The poetic parts of this story are other voice acted and done so in such a way that it really makes you feel the helplessness and solitude of space travel.  I love hearing the cosmonaut speak they really speak from the heart.\n\n\nLevels/Maps:\n\nSpace is huge. I found this out this the hard way when I jumped in a teleporter and ended up an insurmountable distance from my next objective.  It became a zen coasting back to the main playable area while trying to minimize my resource usage so I didn't end up floating forever in the void.\n\nCloser to home the game is much more active and dangerous.  Its meant to be played in proximity to your missions and this is where it is really fun; but I was surprised the game didn't automatically fill the dead space with more random stuff when I was on my accidental journey.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nRymdResa is a fantastic game.  Overall it hit all the right spots with a great universe, wonderful visuals and moving music.  Personally it was a perfect game for me as a fan of pixels and sci-fi games; and the fact it could grow into a bigger game in the future is a welcome bit of hope. The only negative to this game is sometimes the space travel goes on for awhile without anything cool spawning; but these zen moments make the activity all the more interesting.  I hope you get a chance to play it, it's a great experience!\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a copy of RymdResa for review purposes however I was not compensated for my opinions/recommendation those are my own feelings.","August 20, 2015","true","15.1"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","45","61","3","3"

This is not merely a game about wandering through space, this is a compelling story about a cosmonaut who shoulders the responsibility of finding a new home for mankind, and who struggles with a profound loneliness along the way. The voice acting brings the diary pods to life, and adds an emotional power that could never be felt if they were only read. This is immersion done right and it is storytelling of the highest caliber. The diary pods, to me, almost single-handedly elevate this game to the status of art, not simply entertainment.\n\nNot to mention that the game looks gorgeous, and proves to be an enjoyable challenge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anzhou/recommended/269690/","anzhou","Anzhou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anzhou/","246 products in account","I sincerely wanted to like RymdResa. I did find it enjoyable, initially, but the latter part of the game is filled with questionable gameplay decisions that detract from the experience significantly.\n\nRymdResa is an atmospheric, space exploration game with a somewhat charming aesthetic. You are alone in space, and the story is trickled to you in sporadic pieces of poetry. You have no weapons at all, and your health and fuel are one shared resource, which is pretty unique in a space game. It features decently accurate Newtonian physics, which is a rarity in games. The biggest criticism I can level against it mechanically is that you travel faster when moving diagonally, because your velocity is capped in X and Y directions independently.\n\nThere's a standard RPG progression mechanic, with experience and levels, and progression is generally preserved across deaths. There is also loot and an inventory system, which can be transferred across different ships. There is a sort of currency, called spacepoints, which you can spend on new ships. You use the ship once, and if you die you have to repurchase it. Equipped items are preserved across deaths, but are not shared between ships.\n\nThe game itself is broken into 3 chapters. In the first chapter, you have to visit 9 different points on the map. If you die, you have to start over from the beginning. It eases you into the game, and has decent pacing as long as you don't die too often. In chapter 2, you gain a central base. As long as you're able to get back to it, your progress gets saved. It introduces an entirely new progression mechanic, which keeps the game interesting. However, chapter 2 also introduces multiple ways to regenerate health, which makes it significantly easier than chapter 1. There are a few instant-kill events that are 100% RNG based, but that's acceptable in a rogue-like game even if frustrating.\n\nThe final chapter is where it all goes downhill. You once again have to visit 9 different points on the map, this time to gather keys. Fortunately your progress is saved between points, because you will spend 10 or so minutes playing Asteroids betwen each point, except in this game you can't shoot back. The story snippets begins to grow bland and, by the 4th or 5th point, the game becomes a chore. What's worse is that you have 'boss fights' for the last 3 keys.\n\nThe boss fights are a simple frustration mechanic. The bosses are space-god psychopaths, and you beat them with the power of dialogue. You are given sets of two choices multiple times. One is right, the other will get you brutally mauled. Sometimes the answer is obvious, sometimes it's obviously a crapshoot ('left' or 'right' is a choice you have to make multiple times). Unless you consult a guide, it is highly unlikely to win in under a few tries. Combine that with the amount of time required to get back to the boss, and you have at least an hour or two artificially added to the game for no value whatsoever.\n\nTo be honest, I would recommend skipping the last chapter entirely. It introduces no new mechanics, unless you consider attempting to empathize with psychopaths as such. The ending is extremely underwhelming, and frankly disappointing. And the story snippets begin to feel like you attended a poetry reading for longer than 10 minutes.\n\nThe first two chapters of the game are actually somewhat pleasant. But when judging the game, you have to consider it in its entirety. The last third of the game gives no new mechanics, and offers very little payoff for a lot of frustration.\n\nI cannot recommend this game at full price. Even if you are genuinely interested in the premise, you should only consider getting it on a major sale.","April 4","false","9.7"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","1"

That descriptor was enough for me to one, raise an eyebrow and two, quickly see what it was really about. Having started my first run, relaxing wouldn't exactly describe this experience. There was a sense of urgency, lack of control and, a surprising air of hostility. I died within a minute. I tried again and even when taking a more cautious and slowed approach, an asteroid still barreled right into me. I tried again and died within a menu from a pre determined hit to my resources. That's when I realized that the statement was true. It's relaxing if you make it so and go at your own pace but you won't make much progress. It's the peaceful tranquility of a lone existence yet the acceptance of a slow death. That's what this game does so well, it creates an atmosphere of loneliness and quiet contemplation, accentuated by the initial soft piano and stirring audio logs.\n\nBut who has time to think when you suddenly have to reverse course in a instant and wrestle with stopping to avoid that space rock? The game comes alive when you're boosting straight through the gravity well of a sun because you couldn't pull back in time and in doing so, crash through a field of asteroids. Your ship is damaged but you're alive. How about when you're cruising along and suddenly an object 25 times your size comes into view a little too fast for your liking? If anything, the objects should be bigger because it's the most thrilling rush of the game and leads to some awe inspiring moments. It breaks up the banality, you must be alert and pay attention or you're dead.\n\nThe point is space is cruel. Not by design but by nature. Nothing is actively aware or trying to kill you. The point is you have a mission and no matter how hopeless or bleak it seems, it's better than just a-waitin' 'round to die. As a diary log says, just do. The poor guy has suffered enough and no one wants to drift around in a circle for 65 years.","August 22, 2015","true","4.9"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

As you go through space and things come up like FTL in real time with random outcomes.  The thing is that your ship's fuel and life are effectively the same.

Sometimes you get pulled toward your next objective.  Sometimes, often, you get pulled toward certain death.  One time I spawned, went places, randomly found some really good research, got a bunch of XP, and lived a long and fulfilling life before I died.  One time I spawned, got pulled toward two massive stars, used a lot of fuel to boost away from a gravity pull I could not normally overcome, and instantly died because while boosting you lose all control and can't avoid asteroids in your path.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/269690/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: A strange, relaxing, poetic, journey-based roguelike about a lone traveller in space and his mission to help humanity.  Simple to play, RymdResa manages to be both challenging, interesting, and set a wisftul, lonely mood all at the same time.  Worth it for fans of rougelikes, journey-based games, and people wanting something unusual and atmosphric.\n\nRymdResa is a bit difficult to describe.  It's a Space Roguelike, where you gradually build up a ship and a pilot (and more) to take on adventures (through much permadeath).  It's also an artistic, moody, journey based game about one lone traveller with a poetic soul, facing the void and a mysterious mission.   An atmospheric roguelike if you will (that's my current term I'm sticking with).\n\nYou start out in a lone ship after the loss of earth, following vague signals to search the galaxy for particular locations.  Your ship is supported by Resources, which you can find by exploring various worlds, ruins, and artifacts or using abilities and equipment.  Running out of resources means death, and as using your engines or hitting a danger (helpfully outlined in red) costs resources, you want to keep them stocked up.\n\nTravelling will result in random locations coming up, occasional obscure choices, and your character's own poetic observations.  Time passes as well, and every year you may get a new poem, or an incident that changes the game a bit.\n\nYour character also gains experience and equipment, both of which carry over between games.  Research pods let you add new features to your ship - and in an intersting rule twist, require time to develop, so researching something simply requires you to play or wait.   Eventually you can construct your ultimate pilot and ship - though it's still going to be tough.\n\nAdventuring also nets Starpoints, which are spent to respect the character, to purchase new and better ships for that mission only), and so on.  Starpoints also carry over between missions, thankfully.\n\nFiinally the loss of a pilot may let you purchase temporary boosts for the next game - use them well.\n\nThe game is divided into three chapters, each of which has different goals and requirements - on top of assorted side quests you can do.  Your strategies and experiences will change as you explore and upgrade  and encounter more of the mysterious tale.\n\nThe game's atmosphere of isolation, drifting, and speculation is maintained by its music, the character's occasional musings, and the strange and surreal universe the character voyages in.  You may encounter a piece of poetry or a few words hanging in the void, or a space station with tentacles.  One area of space may be interted, another with a background of a pulsing star.  RymdResa is it's own surreal cosmos.\n\nThe developers, as of this writing, are also supporting it with new content and quests.  These people really care about their game.\n\nThe simple play, the many options, and the atmospheric presentation combine to make the game both relaxing and challening, both strange and familiar.\n\nI will note the difficulty curve is going to be different for different players.  Having seen other people's reaction to playing the games, it seems some people take to RymdResa and its easy - for others challenging.  As a guy with a near-supernatural ability to run into things in this game, I was the later.\n\nIs RymdResa a good game?  Most definitely, it shows true artistic craftsmanship, it's easy to pick up, provides depth, and can really reach you.  I've enjoyed piecing together the story behind my ever-returning lone astronaut - or perhaps I'm just making one up from the pieces of poetry.  The game also has a certain compelling element to it that draws you back.\n\nIs it for you?  Well, no, it's not for everyone.  It's best for:\n* If you like Space Roguelikes, flying around and exploring - but also want to relax and not have huge amounts of combat or complex trading routines.\n* If you like journey/travel based games but want something more, something to prod you.\n* If you like experimental games then this is definitely for you.  RymdResa achieves a certain "something" that's worth exploring.  There's something compelling about it.\n* If you want a game that mixes challenge and relaxation in the right amount - but doesn't hold your hand.\n\nSo make the call.  Perhaps you'll join some of us in the stars, ever-returning, reading cryptic poetry in space as we try to save humanity and ourselves.","August 20, 2015","true","15.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

It took me another hour or so to really understand, but this game is a very relaxing, slightly eerie game of exploration.\n\nThere's lots of persistent progress (equipment and levels) that make failed runs much less painful, and generally if runs are going to fail it seems to happen pretty early on. There's lots of ships for different play styles (I love the turtle ship) and the graphics and music really add to the haunting yet peaceful atmosphere.\n\nMy two major complaints are yes, starting is a bit rough, and the game has some near-instakill events at random that can discourage exploration. Especially in the starting ship, exploring a planet can mean certain doom even when not at particularly low health. I don't mind a bit of risk, but randomly taking 200, 400, 1000 damage in a game where you start with 300 health feels unnecessary and goes against the 95% chill vibe of the game.\n\nAll in all, totally recommended, just remember it's a roguelite and that means you die and there's a learning curve.","October 5, 2015","true","12.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Beautiful in every way imaginable, from the custom soundtracks for each ship you can fly in, to the backgrounds of the space around you that shift when you pass through different zones, this game is literally art. If you're a poetry fan you'll like the fact that the only voice acting is read poetry from the pilot, which also helps unravel more of the plot as you go along. Very calming besides the fact that, as any good rogue-like will have, it's nearly impossible to progress the story for a very long time. For instance, i nearly completed the first chapter when i got a gift from the game for travelling through space for 8 years: a wormhole that puts me all the way back at spawn point.

RymdResa translates to “Space Voyage.” If you enjoy poetry and philosophy with your journey through the stars, then this minimalistic asteroid drifter game might be for you.\n\nStory: Castaway in Space\nThe narrative begins with the destruction of your world by an asteroid, which is played out in front of your eyes. Then you are left adrift in your rocket-ship among the stars to recount your angst to the darkness of space. The story is wrapped in poetic devices, which are discovered in pieces as you explore various anomalies on your journey. Events are sad, joyful, lonely, and splendidly beautiful in turns; and so goes the poetry to match.\n\nI bought the game on release day, as I had been waiting for it early for the poetry. Though the achievements were not popping then, I continued to play for awhile for the relaxing music, exploration, and poetry; which was what I was there for to start with. I had been surprised to find the danger element, I guess, considering the relaxing nature of the exploration. But, it all makes sense when you consider the goal of the game is to experience the angst and solitude of being a castaway in space. In space, it has been said; no one can hear you scream. What did I expect? Did I actually think I could float around in space perfectly unharmed? I mean, seriously. Well, I noticed they’ve added a sandbox for just such dreamers like me. But, in returning to the game today after not playing for some time, I noticed the achievies have been fixed. So, though I have progressed no further than the first chapter to date, I look forward to exploring the “rest of the story.”\n\nGame Mechanic: Rhyme without Reason\nI hesitate to use the word mechanic here, because in all honesty there is little mechanics of control allowed the player. You point your little ship in the direction the Sentry is aiming. What follows is an amalgam of random events: chance and luck, with a small bit of skill. You navigate carefully around space, only able to exert thrust or not. I’ve tried using my Steam controller to no avail here. The keyboard controls are mostly a complete waste. The best option is to just use the mouse to pilot the ship; left clicking to thrust, and right clicking when you come up on a random anomaly to explore. The random anomaly may kill you instantly or offer you a choice of bonuses. The bonuses may kill you instantly or give you goodies.\nCollectables include stardust, which is both fuel and health, consumables which offer special abilities and are accessed at will with the number keys, and spaceship parts to upgrade. The upgrade screen has a neat little interface that lets you click and drag found parts onto your ship. But, if you play in a skilled manner, you will probably feel frustrated from the random nature of both the objects that come at you and the luck of the dice roll that the exploration uncovers.\n\nPros:\n*Poetry\n*Enjoyable soundtrack & Lovely digital art style\n*Simple mechanics\n*Large freedom of difficulty choice\n\nCons:\n*Minimalistic Graphics\n*Random Events\n*Little player control\n*Screen Resolution both limited & bugged\n\nI recommend RymdResa for gamers who enjoy philosophical poetry and random event exploration in the stars. If you are in it for the game itself, and not too concerned with a rush for the achievements, then you will find the time in space well spent for drifters.","June 5","true","8.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

Things attack you, but you can't attack back, only avoid. There are different zones with different 'weather' and things to find, and somewhere lurking out there are berserkers...\n\nIt's definitely a rogue-lite. I died within 15 seconds of starting my first game. But then you learn what hurts, and can go longer and longer - at this point it's very relaxing since I never die.\n\nYou may wonder why things are so weird, well there does seem to be a reason: It seems to be an examination of crippling depression and loneliness after a traumatic event that I won't spoil even in the spoiler section, but should become obvious.\n\nA couple tips: 1) If you find a Research Zone, /scour/ it for all the research info. These are relatively rare. 2) At first boost your resource stats, but eventually boost your item finding stats - a good shield will really pay off, 3) recycle items you can't use - do enough and you get a recycled item - some are crap, but some are amazing. 4) Steering is INERTIAL. Once you get up to full speed do not keep holding down the accelerate button, or you will burn all your resources fast. 5) Once you hit max level, reallocate your pilot points - at that point you need much less survivability, much more exploration.","August 24, 2015","true","11.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

RymdResa is a challenging and evolving adventure where abstract poetry and art are expressed throughout a lonely and and calm journey in space.”\n\nThis game.\n\nWell it’s pretty amazing. It’s atmospheric, entrancing and adorable in a borderline creepy way. With your character (or is it the ships AI?) telling you stories, while sometimes even managing to make me laugh.\n\nIt has you piloting a ship and attempting to fulfill various missions. The graphics are almost a Risk of Rain style – Minimalist, but it works withthe title. Less is more and such.\n\nOn one hand it is a relaxing game, on the other it is a nerve wracking drift through the unknown. Too often I would find myself coasting along looking for something and then out of nowhere a space rock would smack into my ship, or a sun would appear in front of me. The game is difficult, it is hard, but you will probably enjoy it.\n\nIt’s a great serving of “In small doses” gaming. I’ve got a few minutes to kill, so I’m going to zip around in space.\nIt’s a somber journey of melancholy proportions with a fascinating soundtrack (I immediately purchased the soundtrack from http://rymdresasoundtrack.bandcamp.com/album/rymdresa-the-original-soundtrack, since I purchased it, the soundtrack is now available via Steam, oh well) to go with the gameplay and help carry it.\n\nThere were a few issues for me, but nothing that kept me from wanting more.\nThe biggest issues I encountered were due to the Steam overlay. Anytime I attempted to screenshot the game, it wouldn’t work. When I attempted to reply to a message by hitting Shift+Tab the game would immediately crash. After some time in the game I figured my friends could wait for my reply, because I’d be damned if I started from zero again.\n\nThe game is rogue-like, you have a ship, you pick up things, equip the ship and carry on. When you die / lose your ship you can restart, which allows you to have the same items equipped. There is a leveling system that also carries into your next game and things called Starpoints that you collect, that are essentially currency. To bring it all home the game has various ships to use and unlock, each with their own pros and cons, adding to the re-playability.\n\nWould I recommend this game, without a doubt. The game mixes a surreal space adventure with poetry that is far better than any I could write and a unique visual style that works. With that all that being said, the price point of 12 dollars and the type of gameplay nearly guarantees you get your money out of the game. Even if it’s only 5 minutes at a time.","August 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I also got lonely, called my wife over to look at things several times and made my way through all three chapters the game currently offers.\n\nGAMEPLAY: You fly top down through space in a style reminiscent of Asteroids- minus the shooting. RymdResa (pronounced Rimmed Reesa) is a nonviolent space exploration game. I can clarify. You are mostly non-violent except for a couple clear screen upgrades. The rest of space didn't get the non-violent memo so your avoiding skills better be ready co compensate. Explore, discover collect powerups and just enjoy the setting.\n\nSOUND: Beautiful music by Tom Croke and Pat Jacobs compliment and enhance your lonely jaunt through the heavens. Take a listen yourself! http://rymdresasoundtrack.bandcamp.com/album/rymdresa-the-original-soundtrack\nIn addition to the music, beepy and boopy sound effects abound and the show stealer is The Cosmonaut's diary. Every two years you ge a voiced entry, be it happy, sad or slightly detatched from reality.\n\nTHE FUTURE: The other day the RymdResa team asked my opinion on what chapter 4 should be about, so don't be surprised to see more content in the future. What do I think Chapter 4 should be about? Well with the ending we are currently at? Anything. Anything at all would work. Assembling the universe. Traveling back to stop the asteroid that whacks your planet. Fixing the Cosmonaut's broken heart. I want any and all of these.\n\nHere is my video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCdAai5Tsw (Don't worry, my review format is brief!) you can hear a couple diary entries in that video.

Becuase death is quick (as it should be if you are standed in space with scant resources), I often looked upon the beauty of the universe and the scraps of humanity's push from our small orb with a scavenger's eye. Did this derelict provide something useful? Does that planetoid have technology I can use? I found myself sprinting from wonder to wonder concerned only with how can I strip it for profit and progress. If it wasn't for one aspect I would say that the press of an oxygen deprived death and afterlife of slow orbit around a derelict space staion would have quickly worn thin. The repeated playthrough structure of the game (I don't want to say rougue-like-lite) provides relief from the stress of dropping gauges and the constant lookout for resources.

At its basest level, it's just a game about collecting items, gaining experience, and not getting obliterated by space debris.  Looking beyond that though you'll find a game that's fairly unique, relaxing, and overall a very different experience from your typical roguelike/lite game.\n\nWhile death will end your current 'run' in RymdResa, almost everything carries over.  Spacepoints (currency), experience, achievement progress, even items all carry over from play to play, ensuring that you're always progressing forward no matter how long your previous journey was.\n\nThe audio/visual is simply stellar.  Done in an almost Gameboy-esque style, the art is in many ways beautiful and fitting for the atmosphere that the game presents, along with the ambient soundtrack.\n\nWhile the writing sometimes tries a little too hard to be 'deep', I find that overall the obscure/cryptic style and synthesized narration do a great job of building on that same atmosphere.  It's definitely not a game that's going to give you warm fuzzy feelings inside (at least from my time so far), but does an absolutely amazing job at presenting the feeling of the vast loneliness of space in an almost soothing way.\n\nOverall, I really like it and would definitely recommend it, definitely a title that stands out in the indie scene today.","August 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Playing it wasn't at all what I was expecting - it's not that it's bad, it's just that it's a really differently paced and designed game than FTL. The only real similarity I found is randomly generated events, as a thing. There are indeed randomly generated events in both games, and their outcomes have an impact on your run, but the gameplay's just really different between them and I wanted a slower paced game with less action and more strategy.\n\nThat said I still would definitely recommend this game to someone looking for a rogue-lite where you pilot a spaceship around and try not to run into stuff while story bits trickle, trickle, trickle into your repeated attempts. It's more action than adventure and gameplay basically involves flying around in a top-down view, with some conserved momentum (spaaaace), without using up all your fuel. You collect some stuff that shows up, and avoid other stuff that shows up, in real time.

There's not too much to see in space, unless you're looking. And if you're looking, you will find it.\n\nThe multiple stages all have their own goals and with 8 different ships and an untold number of ship parts, you can play how you want. You cant speed around scouting co-ordinates far, far away or you can use a beefy ship and cruise along at your own pace without fear of getting wrecked by a single asteroid.\n\nThe one problem I have with this game is what happens when you deliver a full-cargo bay's worth of resources. Instead of being unloaded in one go, the resources trickle out of your ship one at a time, which is ridiculous considering your ship can hold over 1000 resource points. It literally took me 10 minutes to transfer my resources EVERY TIME I filled up my ship. That NEEDS to change in the next update.\n\nThere's alot to experience in this game despite how it will initally look when you begin to play it.","October 6, 2015","true","5.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's kept me coming back in a way that some large AAA titles just haven't.\n\nRymdResa is a roguelite, but it actually falls pretty close to a roguelike; it's fairly complex, although it eschews complex control schemes for ship upgrades and a procedurally generated galaxy with scattered messages and text. Normally I'm not a huge fan of the genre (I played roguelikes back before roguelites came along, and I bear a small grudge about the shift in direction toward simplified mechanics and so forth).\n\nThe real victory that RymdResa achieves is the sense of scale and the wonder of exploration; it has a solid progression mechanic that persists across games, but the real draw of the game lies in the wonderous awe of the stylized universe. Poetry and philosophical musings punctuate your exploration, and while there's a heavy lo-fi filter over everything, there's a coherent thread of design that ties everything together.","March 29","true","4.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The aforementioned terms help but do not quite manage to classify RymdResa, a game that is an oddity amidst the vast and ever expanding ocean of games. An oddity that manages to convey certain emotions that very few other games managed to.\n\n\nRymdResa is a space odyssey, a journey through the vast cosmos undertaken by a lone astronaut who lost his home planet to an asteroid. Resources are scarce and a few coordinates is all that he has. His goal and therefore yours is to find a new place to call a home.\n\nThe game does not offer much vis à vis gameplay in fact there is no combat. Instead, the main focus is exploration. From the haunting fact that is the infinite universe in which you are thrown to the mechanics, exploration is incentivized. The cosmos of RymdResa is colorful and filled with interesting things to see. In addition to the main objectives that obviously differ from chapter to chapter which amount to a total of three you can investigate various sites ranging from planets to abandoned satellites, collect items which you can use to upgrade your ship and research new tech for the same purpose. Some interesting encounters with boss-like entities and peculiar sites are part of the package.\n\nRather than investing in depth, RymdResa embraces the poetic side of itself via a brilliant combination of quasi minimalist art, well written text and great music. Rather than being a game about combat in space and killing aliens, it is a mesmerizing meander through space. Serene and relaxing yet it manages to convey solitude, desperation and melancholy.\n\n\nRymdResa provides an amazing experience and is definitely worth your time if meandering through a vast cosmos is a thing that you crave.","December 6, 2015","true","11.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I assumed it was going to be a "roguelike" in the same vein as Rogue Legacy, and it's not far off from that from a gameplay perspective. You make progress with each game which goes towards future playthroughs, in short. However, what makes this game worthwhile is the setting contrasted with interwoven poetry and ambience that attempts to capture what it would be like alone in space. It's kind of a unique mix of fast-paced, almost twitch gameplay with a slow ambient artful experience musically, visually, and in story.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy seeking out unique games regardless of genre, and this is definitely unique. I haven't made it very far yet and I can't speak on behalf of the long-term gameplay, but for now I'm very much enjoying myself. I can see others who are tired of rehashes of the same game over and over doing so as well, especially those big into video games as an artform.\n\nThis is a good example of what a game can be like when artistic vision is followed through to completion without seeking input from crowd-sourced game design, like how many early access titles seem to be doing. It's like people vote on what they want to see next and the majority wins. That's not art, that's just attempting to appeal to the masses, and you can't make everyone happy. Just look at the forums for Darkest Dungeon after an update. It also loses that something that makes each game special when developed that way too.\n\nTL;DR: This game is delightfully melancholy.","September 9, 2015","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's pretty easy to just dive right into it and start exploring space. The ship variety is good and it was extremely easy to unlock all of them quickly.\n\nEach chunk of gameplay takes a bit of time, so it's not a great game for hopping in and out of. And it's not really "roguelike" besides the fact that there's permadeath, which is what people mean by that these days. However, the permadeth doesn't remove any acquired items and there is a persistent pilot level with passive bonuses that carry over from game to game. Also, any improvements to ships persist after death. So really, it's just procedurally generated levels with "permadeath," meaning progress in quests is lost, but not items. If that's "roguelike" enough for you, hop in. If "roguelike" is something you usually shy away from, don't let that be a factor in deciding wether to get RymdResa or not.\n\nPeople will talk about the poetry, I personally like the bit of space madness and apocalypticism involved, but that's just me.\n\nWorth it at $10","August 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'll mainly be reviewing the gameplay. As far as other parts of this game go, I will say that I find the soundtrack particularly calming, and the audio cues convey their meaning quite well.\n\nThe gameplay to this game is rather simple. First, you get in your Embla Colonizer (or a better ship if you've saved up points), and you engage your thrusters. One important thing to note is that your ship will continue to travel in whatever direction you push it unless something is close enough to exert gravitational force on your ship; usually this will be either a star (deadly), or an interactable object.\n\nYour fuel/health are the same "resource", so generally you try to achieve a desired speed, and then only use thrusters to avoid trouble. You will feel the pull of gravity from objects along the way, until you interact with them. You can gain and/or lose either points or resources from doing so, and earn xp. Some things you interact with will drop items afterwards; if you're particularly lucky, you may even find items adrift in space. Use these items to upgrade your ship, or scrap several of them to make new items.\n\nThe only things I can think of that hinder the gameplay are a lack of interface options, such as being able to zoom out (while reducing the saturation or hue of objects further away so as not to give away danger zones), and having a map that has last seen locations/headings of interactable objects.\n\nOverall, I've enjoyed this game, and at a little over $10, it's not too expensive. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that's a fan of space and roguelikes.","September 23, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Especially the choice of colours did impress me as all seemingly fits into this wondrous space. The music is calming, relaxing and underlines the slow-paced gameplay well, the sound effects are pleasing, specifically collecting the little stars give off a satisfying bling. On the other hand the voice acting is subpar.\nStoryThe audio logs, as well as the overarching story and the odd bosses, which require you to communicate instead of fight, all appear to me as if these were written by a first semester philosophical student... and not the kind who actually is into philosophy, but the kind who wants to appear smart, while drinking their favourite organic kale drink or something.\nGameplayAfter playing more than six hours and completing RymdResa, I am still quite unsure as how to go on about describing this game. Essentially, it is a walking simulator or since you are in space, it is a two dimensional flying simulator I guess. RymdResa has been described as the most relaxing roguelike there is. I would argue against this terminology here, as the only shared game feature between Rogue and RymdResa is procedural world generation and permanent death, and the latter is softened up in RymdResa with some saved progression. When starting a new run, which coincides with creating a new procedurally generated universe, you can select either the starting ship for free, or use previously collected Space Points to purchase a more advanced one. Then, depending on the chapter you are following different missions, either flying towards wherever the arrows points or flying to random locations collecting stuff and afterwards back to where the arrow points. In between you will AT LEAST SOMETIMES encounter stuff, like stars which you can collect for experience, or items that buff diverse statistics of either your current or another possible space craft, or asteroids, mines and the like which hit you and thus subtract the oh so precious resources, which encompass both hit points and fuel at the same time. A rather weird choice for game design to be quite honest. Since speeding around the universe basically costs you hit points, you rapidly are forced to adapt a passive, floating around approach, leading to very slow paced gameplay. This is desired from the game designers though. RymdResa is supposed to be a more zen-like space exploration experience.\nProblems?I personally just got very very very bored. RymdResa is incredibly punishing as soon as you desire to move at a tad faster pace, especially in the first few hours of gameplay, when you are forced to play the cheap space craft with a low amount of resources, which limits your travel as well as your hit points immensely, leading to unfair deaths out of the blue. Also, the chances for you to get positive outcomes for exploration of planets, satellites and the like are pretty low to start off and only increase with the levelling of your pilot, so basically with time. The weird, semi-exciting but still unbalanced start, completely changes all direction as soon as you reached a decent level, about one to two hours in, where the whole game flips everything over. At a certain pilot level and item point, you have a big pool of resources, are possibly able to replenish them often due to stars, refuel stations or consumables, and the whole game turns out to be actually quite boring. For example, I spent around two hours, just flying about the galaxy in order to find research. There seem to be sixteen different research possibilities, and I explored and explored, flew through nothingness for more than fifteen minutes at times, with literally nothing, I repeat, nothing happening on screen, all while in the end not encountering and still having no idea how to obtain any possibility for research. Honestly, I want to like RymdResa. At times, weirdly enough, I enjoyed flying around and exploring, especially in the second and third hour of gameplay or so. Later on I was just brought to endless tedium.\nVERDICTSo let me try to sum up this mess of a review. The aesthetics are great, sound design as well, the gameplay at least for me, is too unexciting. Exploration is not rewarded enough and overall I am just not attached to either my pilot or the missions I am supposed to be doing. The gameplay in itself is just not enough to drag me into the game, as it is frankly plainly boring. I want RymdResa to be so much more than it is, sadly it is not. If you are into zen-focused games, RymdResa might be for you though.","August 21, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Death can come quickly for a while, but then after a while you may want to die rather than play the tediousness any more, as you have enough equipment to survive. Once you see that you can make the camera stay centered, much of the artifical difficulty of no forward view disappears. There's no way to zoom out your view, so that sucks, especially when you run right into a sun just offscreen. The designers did this, though, because half the time the game "procedurally" generates stuff as it's coming into view. Really poor design.\n\nWant spacepoints? Grind. Can't afford a higher-level ship? Too bad. Get research? Oh, that's random, so early level stuff might not appear for you until chapter 3. You also buy research with the same spacepoints you get ships with. See a planet? Press a single key and hope the RNG gods favor you. Even when you have choices, 95% of the time comes down to luck. Want achievements? Well, congrats, because the "beginner" achivement requires that you get level 25. Out of 40. You'll hit halfway through chapter 3 before you get level 25. Want to access those science events? You get to pour 25 points into a skill that has no use until chapter 2, so you'll neglect it until you realize those events are the only way to survive.\n\nThere's no save and leave feature, so I have hours and hours of "play time" when I left the computer for work or sleep. And since I didn't want to lose an expensive ship for no gain of spacepoints or "legacy" (which sucks), I idled the game for easily 85% of my "play time".\n\nThe poetry sucks, so I turned it off. After playing for a while longer, I realized that reading (or at least clicking past) the sucky diaries gives you points. So, back on it went. And I grew more annoyed at the "depth" of a teenager's lamentations of loneliness. The voice was just as annoying, so that left as well. The music was decent, but tied to a game wholly undeserving of it.\n\nDon't buy this.

So in place of conflict and challenge as in most other games, it's trying to bring the player inner peace and mindfulness.\n\nThe devs have been working hard in that direction, obviously. The artworks, visual style, music and poems are well fitting together, and the mood is well set. However, the game design fell short and ruined the whole experience.\n\nSo the biggest problem is, the game is not really calming. Your ship is drifting through the space, watching space objects floating past and the sectors changing from one to another, and your mind is somewhere in a higher plane. And KABOOM!!! From nowhere, a piece of space rock smashes right into your ship, immediatly taking 97% of the resource with it, leaving you to die, in space. You have to be on high alert almost all the time against sudden and deadly annoyances, it's like a bizzare marrage between poems and cheap jump scare flicks.\n\nThe gameplay elements are not nicely tuned either, e.g. I see no point in taking anything else other than the "tough" ships. The items seem pretty useless most of the time too.\n\nSo in all, it's a nice concept lacking proper game design, which ruined the day eventually.","September 18, 2015","false","6.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Also, the ship changes orientation instantly but has momentum and can’t go backwards. It’s very counterintuitive.\nYou will die a lot at the beginning of the game. I understand that it’s a rogue-like, but I almost quit after 30 minutes of play because It was getting too frustrating. The unresponsive controls paired with the fact that you apparently died when someone looked at you the wrong way made for a very unrewarding experience.\nI don’t know if it’s intended, but I discovered that the resources replenish every time you enter a menu. This meant that I was never close to dying after I discovered that.\nThe boss “fights”\nThe conclusion:\nI could see what the developers wanted from RymdResa, even with the underwhelming controls and the frustrating first hour of the game. It really is a poetic treaty on loneliness and exploration, which is very well underlined by the soundtrack and the whole art direction. But the main thing with a game like this is to keep you interested, and I was ready to quit after 30 minutes...but I had to do this review. The game picks up as soon as you get your second ship and it might have been a fluke, but after I got enough money to get the third ship, it became a by the numbers game, with absolutely no danger for me to die. Except in the boss battles, which are a trial and error, “what did the author mean” dialogue. With a bit more balancing between the countless deaths at the beginning and the lack of deaths after that, it could’ve been an enjoying ride. But as it is, I cannot recommend it.\n\nYou can see me playing it here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awv43P6vooY","August 28, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"
