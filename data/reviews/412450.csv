Not sure if this Rust clone is really this messed up or if we are being trolled.\n\n"But but but it's early access" you say? Even early access SHOULD BE PLAYABLE. You paid for it right? Did you just want to make a donation and hope they would eventually make the game or did you want to ACTUALLY PLAY SOMETHING? THIS ISN'T KICKSTARTER.\n\nI thought I had seen the absolute worst of the worst of the latest results of steam's new ultra-low standards but boy was I wrong. The only thing this game has going for it is the visual art but that can be attributed to the unreal 3 engine. I wouldn't be surprised if they just bought a few content packs.\n\n\nNow the long list of everything that sucks about this barely-even-a-tech-demo-but-released-as-early-access anyway.\n\n- Long loading times.... just to get to the main menu... then long loading times to join a server.\n- Every server shows 0 players.... even if they are full.\n- If you can't join a server it kindly hands you another long *ss loading screen, but doesn't have the decency to tell you about it. It makes you continue to wait thinking you are still being connected.\n- You have to restart the game ANY TIME YOU WANT TO RECONNECT TO A SERVER.\n\nLet me sum these up for you so you can understand the connection sequence.\n\nStart game... loading loading loading loading... ok let's get a server list. Oooo look I am the first player! Let's try chicago.\nLoading loading loading laoding, frozen screen, loading more loading more... Oh I heard some ambient sound!! Oh wait it stopped.... loding loding... Oh back to the main menu. Ok let's try this again.... Loading... YOU MUST RESTART THE GAME. Ok let's restart. What's that steam? It's already running? Wait 10 minutes to end task (because it's taking up all your memory). Repeat until you finally get in 5 hours later.\n\nOk if you manage to get in the game you still have a lot of surprises coming your way:\n\n- You can play a maximum of 20 minutes before the server crashes.\n- Your character is saved LOCALLY, not on the server. Ahhh we trust gamers... they won't CHEAT OR ANYTHING.\n- That's ok though... you can max out your skills in about 20 minutes picking carrots.\n- Of course when your inventory is full of carrots you can only drop 1 at a time by clicking the carrot then clicking drop. (it looks like you can drop stacks of items, but guess what? DOESNT WORK! It will drop a bag but the bag only contains ONE ITEM).\n- You can kill anything with a sharpened stick (the first thing ANYBODY CAN MAKE).\n- Want to play as a female? I THINK NOT. If you choose female you are BORN DEAD.\n- Did you die? Guess what you have to alt-tab and end task to quit the game!\n- You lose all skills and XP when the next time you play. Did you lose connection or did the server crash? Well here we will just take all your skills and xp away. You can keep your sharp stick though. Oh yeah if you spent 1000 gold on a house, we will take that away too.\n- You might as well hang out picking carrots for the entire game because that's the only way to keep your hunger meter from killing you. You will need to eat them almost as fast as you can pick them.\n- Did you unlock the next class and want to make a new character? HAH fooled you. You just erased your old character by trying to create a new one! Now you can completely start over from scratch and still no unlocks! Hah! Don't even think about canceling the creation of this new character... YOU CAN'T!\n- See a house you want to go into? NO PLAYERS ALLOWED. INVISIBLE WALL THERE.\n- Want to swim out to those rocks about 10 feet off the shore? TAKE INVISIBLE DAMAGE AND DIE.\n- it's ok though. Plants like to spawn in mid-air where you can see them from miles away.\n- go ahead and jump off that ridiculously high cliff. It won't hurt you\n- Hey look a mine! Hah you can't go in. INVISIBLE WALL.\n- Hey look, NPCs in a city! Too bad you can't go in! INVISIBLE WALL.\n- Hey look another player! They kill you. The guard just watches.... until you try to defend yourself... then he tries to kill you too. They would kill you twice if they could.\n- Spend 2 hours just trying to connect. Steam won't refund because you "played for 2 hours".\n\nThe Simpsons predicted this game. Yard Work Simulator 2016.\n\nHad I been able to get a refund I would not have posted this very negative (albeit truthful) review. Maybe someday when steam decides to grow some standards and developers learn that accepting money for a game too early hurts their bottom line they will prioritize their "resources" so this sort of thing does not happen as often. Until then I will post things like this every single time I lose some money in the hopes that they lose more money than I did (and gamers like me will save their money). Thing is I BARELY EVEN TRIED to be mean. This was my ACTUAL gameplay experience, and it seems to be happening more and more lately.

It's an alpha build, it's going to be built upon and hopefully improved. Right now it's incredibly rough around the edges(Much more so than I was expecting), keybindings are really messed up, only three classes are unlocked and not much is explained to you. There's also, as of launch(Which isn't really surprising), some server/client issues connecting to servers. I connected on my first try just before launch but it's looping requiring the game to restart which is something -- right now at least -- I think has to do with the servers being updated for the launch and the client, through steam, not being updated yet although I could be totally wrong here. Either way I would expect server issues to be fixed within a few hours, not something I would hold against a game specifically and give reason for a down vote unless this were a persistent issue.\n\nHaving said that, there's a lot of promise here, promise not seen in many games. For one, this game runs really well on my machine(R9 390, 16GB DDR4 RAM, i5 6600) for what's being rendered and loading times are short. I'm getting around 40-60FPS with everything maxed and motion blur turned off(Can only be turned off in-game at the moment under a placeholder options menu), no stutters or performance dips and the core basics seem to be in place. The game world also looks really nice and fleshed out but the character models do need some work.\n\nI would say be prepared for a rough entry point as of now. Don't buy the game if you expect a feature complete game. This really doesn't seem to be anywhere near feature complete but more towards having the basics in place for the core gameplay to be experienced. Other than that, really, just don't disappoint yourself thinking the game is going to be near complete in it's early access period. They literally took the definition of what Early Access was supposed to be about and applied it here; a game with promise and only for those who really want to get in on early alpha builds.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with releasing an early alpha version of a game through Early Access as that's exactly what EA is all about. I've seen one game come to EA like The Black Plague and they delivered immensely on their product, that game being Subnautica. It too had a very barebones release and it was heavily suggested you only invest if you really wanted a taste of the game and support the devs but after a few months the entire title has been fleshed out, added upon and improved through and through becoming one of the best games in it's genre.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game if you expect an almost finished product or anywhere near finished but for the promise shown and the premise of the title I would recommend picking it up if you have the money spare, are interested in the genre and want to see where it goes from here.","April 19","true","1.2"," 303 of 433 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","303","433","11","32"

I expected this game to be something great when it first came out, and it DEFINITELY wasn't. After realizing that, I changed my review to be negitive, which was a good idea, considering I definitely did not recommend it at the time. But now, after playing it after V0.03, I'm seeing it improve a lot.\nUpon initial release, character saves randomly got deleted, constant server crashes, there were only 2 or 3 NPC merchants, skill trees reset when you left a game, and there were floating trees and shrubs everywhere. It was horrendous, so horrendous, that the devs basically agreed.\n\nThe thing is, Syrin Studios is working their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off to patch it and make it as awesome as it can be. So far, people who got this game on the initial release day have seen great improvements in optimization, an increase in the amount of not only NPC merchants, but NPCs in general. We've seen a removal/fix of all floating shrubbaray, and water that you can actually swim in, as well amazing connection to their servers (The other day I was playing on a server with 150 ping that's located in the UK while I'm in NY with no problem at all). This game is improving fast, and unless they suddenly stop updating as a whole, I'm going to leave this recommendation.\n\nGood luck Syrin Studios, you're doin' good things, keep it up. I recommend this game to people who want to invest in a game that is not only already enjoyable, but to people who want a game that is going to keep improving until it is finished.","May 10","true","14.4"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","55","70","2","4"

The very few people that are playing tend to resort to KOS tactics, leading to you being killed while in a menu screen (selling to trader, crafting etc), being killed by the terrible AI when you try to defend yourself, or being killed by one of the new archers(aim bot) that have been put in since they can't get the AI to function at all.\nCurrently more servers than active players and i can't see that changing any time soon with the state the game was released, and currently still is, in.\n\nThese server and crashing issues were well known before release, with the dev's unable to fix it, but rushed this out into EA anyway, which has effectively killed off the player base before it even got going.\n\nAt the moment, putting your money into this is definitely a risk.","April 25","false","2.9"," 49 of 79 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","49","79","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/recommended/412450/","sonoralax","Sonora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/","456 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I first heard of The Black Death: "this game is going to be great! I can't wait!"\n\nDuring my first play through: "I won this game in a giveaway... can I give it back?"\n\nAfter some reconsideration: "okay, I'll just give it some time."\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe Verdict\nAS OF 29 APRIL, 2016, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR EARLY ACCESS GAMES.\n\nYou will experience many feelings throughout your own playthrough of The Black Death. Whether good or bad,  this game does have potential. While what is has to offer has been presented in a very clunky and buggy format, in the back of our mind, we ultimately have to remember that this is an "EAG" (and requires a little more TLC than most).\n\nI will try to hit on the various points with as much detail as I can possibly provide:\n\nGameplayYour mission is to survive during an unforgivable era, where the plague is apparant and danger peeks from every corner. Various classes offer their own unique benefits; your goal is straightforward though: survive. In order to, you must either scavenge camps that are littered throughout the map, hunt for wild game, mercilessly murder guards and bandits, and gather food (ranging from wild berries, carrots, cabbage, etc.) In a nut shell, your typical survival game.\n\nSo, what does The Black Death have to offer beyond this description? Well, let's get down to business:\n\nInterfaceI'm not going to sugarcoat it: the interface is terrible. There are windows all over and, overall, it's just an unorganised mess that got under my skin within minutes. Hopefully this will be addressed and improved with future patches.\n\nGraphicsUnless you own an actual gaming computer, you will not be enjoying the beautiful graphics that The Black Death has to offer. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest pluses of the game. Unfortunately, due to my non-gaming setup, I am unable to experience thie game in its full glory. If you are blessed enough to have an amazing rig though, pay attention to the detail in the environment. How the grass ripples through the land. How the fog settles through the dark environment that you call "home". All in all, they truly did an amazing job...\n\n... But then you have what I like to affectionately call "the derps". What are "the derps"? Well... the boar that zooms away from you after you attempt to kill it. The militia men who develop deep cuts on their back yet remain stationary (but then suddenly zoom away from you). This includes the deer as well: anything that moves, it will zoom away. I'm going to take a guess and say that the developer's are really into The Flash.\n\nAudioThe audio is another big plus: it offers an accurate depiction of the sound of a boar, gathering berries and stuffing it into your knapsack, trees rustling, and, not that I have any experience in this (I swear!) the 'whoosing' sound of a weapon flying at, and into, someone, etc.\n\nControlsWhile I am still not a big fan of the controls, it has improved slightly since the latest update/patch. CAPS LOCK is no longer the "menu" button, and "E", which is the "pick up" key (kind of important), actually works now (and in unison with the left mouse, too). Other controls could be made a lot easier. Keep up with the improvements.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPros+ Gameplay is a little more optimised and smoother than before.\n+ The audio has a lot to offer and is of good quality\n+ Overall, the graphics are amazing. More on this in the "Con" section.\n+ Better use of some keys - you no longer have to hit "Caps Lock" in order to open menu.\n+ Servers have definitely improved a lot since I first wrote this review. Before, you couldn't evenenter one, but now you can. It does take awhile to load, but that may be due to issues on my end.\n+ Developer's are very active on their forums. They are willing to address the many issues of the game and have been working to better improve the game play experience. While there still remains many problems, hopefully they are all worked out and the developer's can offer the vision that they truly hoped to present.\n\nCons- Deer can float.\n- Why can't I be a woman?\n- Please... PvP needs to be fixed.\n- The music is great. Even when you don't want to listen to it, it's great. Please, let me turn it off.\n- Clunky design of the interface can make for a very irritating game experience. As of 29 April, the inventory is still a mess.\n- The combat system that The Black Plague has adopted is more appropriate for a late 1990s game. It is unacceptable for its release year and expect it to improve vastly over time.\n- Walking into the mountain side is not a treat: you will glitch. I've taken a screenshot if you want to see what I mean. Also, your body will randomly disappear into the mountain side as well - screenshot proof as well.\n- Game crashes are not as frequent as people claim them to be. They are apparant, however, yet really only occur once every 30 minutes or so.\n- Combat is still extremely glitchy. Last time, aiming at an NPC was next to impossible because you had to be extremely close range. Now aim is still off AND you can see through your own body, thus making it next to impossible to view your assailant. This is not a 1990s game - please fix this.\n- The "zoom" glitch is still apparant - I tried to kill a deer and it went different directions quite rapidly. There is no way to approach this deer without startling it, or I'm just doing something wrong. Could there be a "stealth mode" option? Or just fix the zoom's.\n- In regards to the combat, NPCs should be rebalanced. As it stands, the peasant class stands no chance versus bandits or guards. Also, if I draw a weapon, everyone shouldn't be rushing me at the same time. I wanted to kill a deer but I guess it was protected by the king: I died to 4 guards instantly - where did they even come from?! They should stop being so sensitive.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n23 April, 2016For now, I do not recommend this game if you are not into Early Access Games. As with all EAG's, you are the guinea pig, therefore you will find your experience to be subpar at best. I will be giving this game a tentative "yes" recommendation, however, due to the fact that I find myself coming back - regardless of past experience. I really do have high hopes for this title and will update this review the more I play the game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n26 April, 2016Since my last review, the game has still not been updated. When a game has a 19,99$ price tag, I expect patches and updates to be frequent - especially when it's in Early Access. The developers, while friendly and willing to work with the community, have thus far failed to live up to expectations with their updates (which, I repeat, are infrequent).\n\nI am unable to change my Steam recommendation to "no" because of the review system, and I know I will change it frequently, therefore I have mentioned my reasoning throughout. I hope that the game improves enough for me to stand by my "yes" recommendation that I am "stuck" with. If there are no improvement whatsoever, I will change it in a heartbeat.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n29 April, 2016I decided to give the game another go, and I really do find myself enjoying it a lot more now that I've familiarised myself. I'll reiterate this again: get this game if you're into EAG's. If you, however, would rather have a finished product, avoid this game like the plague (no pun intended).\n\nOverall6/10","April 23","true","4.0"," 42 of 68 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","42","68","8","6"

With a focus on a skill tree and Roleplay rather than Individual castle creation, it brings out features that have not been seen before in Multiplayer survival games.\n\nThe Pros The Game is a Great concept, and will continue to develop, it has a high caliber publisher that won‚Äôt let it fall apart like other titles we have seen before  New Take to survival, The Features are new and different from your usual survival game. for example, there is no building, but rather an economy that includes the purchasing of housing "Deeds" The Skill Tree,The Skill Tree is very similar to Skyrim in concept, however it finds its unique qualities in the fact that the more you level up the more you have access to different character classes  Character classes, probably by far one of the most Roleplay features is the class system, forced to select from a starting three the player will be aided and held back by the certain quality his character has.  NPC, NPC are present in the game and will continue to develop in their role. Movement patches as well as additional dialog will likely be added as the game progresses.  The Price, The price is not what they said it would be... believed to be coming out at $20, it has been released as a $17.99 game.\nThe Cons Like in all Early Releases there are the drawl backs,\nThe Bugs. there are bugs, and it will effect game play. But do not worry they will be patched soon.  There is no VoIP YET however it is on the top of the list for player requested add-ons and will be coming soon!  server reliability, the servers have been having troubles due to it being launch day. but do not worry that is the top priority on the list and will be resolved ASAP  No Anti-Cheat, Anti-Cheat is not currently apart of the game, but will be added soon\nThe Future? When answering what will the future hold for  The Black Death I think about what it has from the start. It is a game with a HUGE publisher, NPC's, Economy system, classes, and Skill tree's. Even if they just polish up what was provided from the start it would be a good game.\n\nBut that is not what will happen.\n\nRumor has it that the darkness does not end in the morning, and more lives will be lost to  The Black Death. here is a list of the potential add-ons to come.\nShip Travel  Mine exploration  Dialog  New weapons and craft able items  Horses  New Map locations  NPC‚Äôs  Classes  Lots more Death\n\nClosing Remarks\nThe game is worth the money. If you wait and get it, you will miss out on an awesome experience. The developers have been active in talking with the community and listening to what we have to say.

This game does not meet any of those criteria.\nAt best this is a "Proof of Concept".  To call it Alpha is a stretch. Steam should have better vetting methods before letting people spend their money for a project that will more than likely be abandoned once the developers figure out that they bit off more than they a could chew.\n\nServer stability is a know issue, there is no permanence at this point, very little to craft, the AI is broken, and it suffers from more than the black plague....\n\nIts one of those "survival" games where you see a bandit with armor and an axe, so you risk it all to go in and take him out, you do, easily, because he just stands there... your reward? Is it the Axe and armor he was wearing? Nope.... its a bone club and an apple....\n\nI have worked extensively in Unreal, I teach several college level courses on Game Mechanic Design and Level Design and I have had students create a more fleshed out immersive game while doing a 24 hour Dev Blitz.  The use of assets is horrible, plants float in mid air, collision is off on objects and the terrain, the animations are stiff, the combat is possibly the worst of any release in the past 10 years. You can launch a pre-made project template in Unreal add a few blueprints and some UI, import some assets from the assets store and you would have a better optimized game, how they jacked this up this bad is beyond me. I could speculate but its pointless to do here.\n\nSave your money, wait 6 months to see if they actually update it and try to address the issues or if they just take the money and run.  I see very little passion in this title, its rushed and broken, even for an "Alpha".\n\nI for one and trying to find the refun option...","April 19","false","3.5"," 57 of 99 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","57","99","0","1"

Almost none of the features are implimented and the few that are, don't work properly due to the insane amount of bugs. The game performance is terrible and almost unplayable for most people I've spoken to (including myself). The options menu doesn't work half the time. There's an audio settings tab but nothing there, so you'll have to adjust your sound via the Windows mixer.\n\nWhen you enter the game you'll choose one of three "classes".

Right there.

So far as I know, Only the Peasant and Militia have uses in this build (v0.02, which says a lot for how built the game is people, learn to read.) but it shows the landscape and the potential the devs have to build on this idea they've brought about to the public.\n\nI've brought about the comment of it being build 0.02 many times this article, and that's because people apparently aren't seeing it. Gamers expect a game that's sitting at build 0.75 or more, with 1.0 being the complete game in its entirety. They didn't look at the dev notes seeing that it was literally nothing more than a proof of concept, complained that it's a proof of concept and how they paid for a full game, and now they want their refund. To this I say; "Get out."\n\nNo seriously. If you don't want to support a dev for a game that has potential, but would rather come back when it's 10+ dollars more and near v0.75+, be my guest. I will happily bugsplat this game for these guys, and I will welcome anyone who joins me in the servers. I look forwards do chatting with you all there.\n\nSo far I've paid $20.00CAD, I've gotten about $5.00 in play value, and am happily awaiting news of when the next $15.00 will be released. I've put my money into ARK, Prison Architect (before it became Steam-able), and more games that have turned out to be not flops. Amidst the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• devs and people who tackle way too big a project, this team has been able to offer more than 8 bit textures and bring to the table interesting ideas that have not been implemented in other games I've played (Because I haven't played EVERY game, ladies and gentlemen.)\n\nI look forwards to seeing less crocodile tears, and more players who want to help.

Games in development are not finished products and just like a fine wine will age better with time. Words like potential and promise get thrown around too much when describing what a game can be without much to support it. Hope can be a powerful weapon to justify a purchase and it is a fair idea to give the benefit of the doubt to the creator. You knowingly pay into a work in progress when buying off the cattle farm that is Early Access, but that does not mean some games shouldn't be left to mature longer before taking them to auction.\n\nI wish I could write more about this game, but honestly I cannot even reach the game server list without crashing. Time after time, the screen would freeze and tremble before the mystical "Plague has stopped working" message appears, only to then crash as the list briefly appears behind it. The one aspect I could mess with was the settings menu, which has a hard to responding to clicks of the mouse cursor. The changed settings, once apply is hit, refuse to accept and change. Once I crashed for the first time, then the changes set in.\n\nI should also mention a couple of times I was forced to restart my computer completely to eliminate a black box that stained my monitor after attempting to load the game. It happened three out of the eighteen times I attempted to play this shell of a program. I am not sure how bad the optimization for the game is, but judging from the stutters in the main menu alone, it is a long way from being labeled stable.\n\nThis game just hit Early Access, I understand that, but games like this are why these Early Access reviews are needed. There is a difference between a working product and a playable product; people need to understand the crap shoot will either block you from playing altogether or let you claw your way in at this stage. Once I get on a server, I will try to review it properly, but for now I cannot with good faith even tell people to wait a month or so. Avoid this like the plague.\n\nPros\n\n- None for now\n\nCons\n\n- Unresponsive settings options\n- Crashes on every attempt to locate a server","April 19","false","1.4"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

You slide all over the place and with only 3 buttons that are both your attack and block? Wait what? You attack and after the attack you leave the weapon on the side of that attack?

But if you loot a trader stand or house etc etc it says stealing.. To bad no one cares or does anything to stop you.. The only time AI guards react is if you attack or draw your weapon on them or another player. I can steal the weapon mercheants sword then sell it back to him for 160 gold like every 2-3 min.. I can buy the entire main town.. Something like that.\n- FIX this problems.\n\n3. World is wierd.. many areas feel out of place or empty..

Somethings you can but so much you can not.\n\n4. AI Is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.. Animals slide as a deer on ice with a fourth july rocket up there ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.. Bandits dont bother you untile you hit one of them then every bandit around 100m will come and gangbang you.  also they hardly drop anything of worth when you can steal the entire town and sell it back to the people living in it.\n- You know what to do!!

This game's trailer show people farming, Interacting with people.. A guy selling fishing rods to people that sell fish back to him etc etc.. Milita fighting and becoming hired.. Well That doesn't happen in the game..

Early Access and Alpha released survival games have become the norm, but oooh boy, let me tell you about TBD.\n\nOnce you start the game you're greeted by a series of opening clips for the game developer, publisher etc. The goal of which is to try and destroy as many ear drums as possible. "That's okay" you'll think. "I'll just turn down the volume in the ingame settings". NOPE.\n\nThe ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing audio settings page is blank. That right there should be enough to tell you that the game is no where near ready to be tested. But if you're brave you'll venture on and try to join a server. Operative word is try. I'm not one to really bash a game for server issues on a launch day. Triple A MMOs get it wrong all the time so I surely don't expect a flawless launch for some indie developer but holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, it's bad. After my 8th (not joking) attempt at joining a server I finally loaded in and started off my life as a peasant.\n\nI picked some cotton and made some bandages. Then the server crashed....Fortunately I got in on my first try the next server and repeated the same. Picked some cotton, picked some berries. Made some bandages and ate the berries. Grabbed a stick and crafted it into a pointy stick then spent the next 3 minutes smashing keys to try and figure out how to wield and attack with the pointy stick I just made. Once I had the stick ready to poke things with, I murdered a pig. I don't mean that I went out hunting, I just straight up murdered a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing pig. It just stood there while I stabbed it in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• until it puked up a bunch of viscera on the ground in front of me. After looting the pile of pig innards I had some meat I wanted to cook. No fire, and no way to make fire I ran up a hill towards a castle before I was disconnected and had to reload the game again.\n\nThroughout this entire ordeal my friend was opening and closing the game attempting to join the same server as me so we could start our lives off as potato farmers. The UI is pretty, but cumbersome. Buttons can't be remapped and you can't even open a menu with the ESC key (literally the first game I think I've ever played that has NOT had this built in).\n\nThe graphics are decent but it's far from optimized as you would expect. The sound is buggy. I heard running water in the middle of the woods with no river near by and the crackling of fire when I was standing alone after trying to "cook" my pig meat. The combat is janky as there are three different "stances" you have to take but it just ends up being obtuse.\n\nThere is only one reason to purchase the game as it stands, and that's to support the developer. Don't pick this up to even play test it, you'll just get frustrated. I myself am requesting a refund. I have seen too many developers release a game in this half baked state (although I have to say...this is the worst I've ever personally experienced) just to take the money and run. The fact that the video adjustment settings did nothing and there isn't even an audio settings page tells me how unready the devs really are for this early access release.\n\ntl;dr: This game is not ready to be considered "Early Access" and should have never been put into the hands of the Public. Basic things like audio/video settings or in game menus to quit the game are MISSING.\n\nBeware. Reeks of cashgrab.\n\n","April 19","false","0.5"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","20","38","0","0"

I can't recommend anyone purchase it though unless you want to pay them to alpha test the game. I undestand this is early access. However, the game is too broken to be remotely playable. There are all sorts of in game problems, one of which included a merchant bug that allowed me to buy a crude sword for 20g, and sell right back for 160g. I then used the profits to purchase as many houses as possible.\n\nThat's just a small evidence of how broken it currently is. They have no way to currently save your skill progression... No point in logging out unless you want to start from scratch again...\n\nI'll update if/when they fix the major issues.","April 20","false","2.3"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","23","44","0","0"

In its visuals and sound, it is already very beautiful and immersive, and control is smooth. I'd say the foundation is very promising and it has has huge potential as a dark, medieval, multiplayer experience.\n\nAfter fixes, which the devs seem to be avidly on top of, I can see how the game's features could continue to be added to, characterisation become even more complex, and player freedom open up in so many new ways. The developers seem to be fans themselves of this genre and very community conscious. I can see how the contribution of RP in this game could be especially involving and player-empowering.

Absolutely nothing as it was advertised in the video gameplay and game description page.\n\nCannot even play the game due to servers being almost impossible to connect to. Even after the latest 0.02 hotfix. And when you're actually rarely able to connect to a server, you'll get disconnected within 5 minutes of gameplay and lose everything. Items, skills, level, stats, all gone. And even when you do get to exit the game normally, it STILL doesn't save any of your progress, so you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of luck if you plan on not wanting to start over and over and over again.\n\nI know this is EA. But, I've played many EA games that are actually playable and have very positive reviews. This, on the other hand, is an embarrassment to the Steam store and early access as a whole. It is extremely unoptimized running at max settings and getting only 24-29 fps. I have a high end PC: GTX 980 ti, Corei7 6700k 4.4ghz quad core, SSD 2TB, 16GB RAM and 1GB internet.\n\nThis game is not even ready for early access. More like an extremely early prototype to be exact. We are paying to help a game grow into fruition, we aren't getting paid to test the game. How can we even justify the price when we can't even play the damn game?\n\nThe game is being developed and published by ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Englishmen. And it shows. No wonder why they no longer have an empire LOL. And they still have a queen! Which actually has no power at all! Hahaha talk about pathetic. She even went bankrupt and had to get a loan to buy her own clothes lmfao.....\n\nAll of the "positive" reviews given to this garbage of a game are rigged. They are all paid friends of GreenManGaming. It is hilariously and pathetically obvious. Do not believe any of the positive reviews. You can tell that they are written by greenmangaming and friends. They even defend the game for not even starting haha.\n\nSteam's mega low standards have turned a new leaf and have gone down the hole so to speak. You can't even call this early access. More like an "early hopefully the game will even become available to access within the near future" haha.\n\nPlease please please do not support these garbage amateur so called "developers" (I wouldn't even call them developers at this point). More like wannabe devs.\n\nEdit: Post from another member, he was banned from the forums for stating the truth behind this scheme:\n\n"Green Man Gaming is telling people to give positive reviews for this game for free keys. Don't be tricked guys. This is happening. Green man gaming are real crooks. All the positive reviews are rigged. Green man is also telling people to spam "thumbs up" to every positive review and spam a "thumbs down" to every negative review so only the positive rigged reviews show up on the front page since Green Man Gaming has so many fans willing to do this for free keys.\n\nDon't let this get unheard. It is painfully obvious at what they are doing. Just read the positive reviews and look at the hours of game time that they have.\n\nThe developers and publishers of this atrocity of a game are an embarrassment to the gaming community.

However, today this was fixed and the servers are now (as far as I can tell) steady and working fine, with a slight optimization update that gives you a few extra FPS (that's always nice) and somewhat smoother animations although the animations might be the same and I might not have noticed them previously due to the bad servers. The game still has bugs of course, but the developers are clearly working to the bone to get them fixed, you must keep in mind that the developers consist of 7 people (and a half) who are working to the best of their ability to fix the issues that arose during the release.\n\nThe game has potential, they could add in the ability to craft your own furniture in the future (add/remove furniture from your home), perhaps remove the merchants high inventory space and replace it with less weight on certain items (like cotton), allows merchants to craft or buy bags that allow more inventory space, fix the housing prices since some houses are way overpriced for what they are (all houses are currently set to 2 prices), slight increase on crude weapons since they break after 1-2 resources, fix the guards who sometimes attack the person who is the victim to a slaughter rather than the person who started the assault, fix the guards since they don't attack you for stealing (they should only not attack you when you steal out of their sight), add a day/night cycle, possible classes could be (Knight, Thief, Carpenter, Baker, Butcher - really limitless classes that could be implemented in the near future), ability to buy a home and then rent it out to other players via in-game rather than RP, guards shouldn't attack you for killing animals outside the city, trying to craft a merchants tunic seems to break crafting (at least in my experience) so that would need fixing, sometimes people who jump around get stuck in a sleeping animation and that's how they'll appear walking around.\n\nI am excited to see what this game will become, and I'm happy that I purchased the game early access because I'm capable of watching it go through all the little updates to the end product.","April 19","true","27.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

People who are complaining about there being no gameplay, this game is in a very early stage, it`s pretty obvious that there would be glitches, that`s why it`s in testing.\n\nThere are 3 classes you can play as, the Militia, whuch is basically a warrior class. The Merchant, which is self explanatory, and the peasant, who can plant crops. The militia can kick in battle but I hadn`t figured out how to yet so I`m not sure if it`s in the game at this moment.\n\nYou can craft weapons, armor, and other various things with ingrediants you harvest from around the world. You can sell and buy things from merchants, and the crafting is pretty easy to understand.\n\nYou also level up after killing creatures, and harvesting ingrediants. The perks are pretty useful.\nThis game has a lot of potential in my opinion. But as of right now (Version 0.03) there isn`t much gameplay yet. I`d recommend this game if you`d like to help out the Devs in the making of this game.","April 30","true","6.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I purchased the game as soon as it hit Steam, being a big fan of medieval roleplaying and the concept the game is portraying. And was actually pretty disapointed with the lack of gameplay. I don't like how the company released the game so early and with so little content, but I do understand it is Early Access. I want to support this game because there is tons of potential and I believe it will live up to it's potential in time. But right now I can honestly say, don't purchase if you want to play it right now, purchase it to support the company, help them improve the game. I will return later when there is much much more content to the game but as of now I am taking a hiatus from it.

It currently is dealing with severly bad server issues, servers tend to crash every 5-40 minutes. Currently, skills (the perk system) do not save if you logout of the game via crash or exit; however, inventories do save. The graphics are very stunning (it is unreal engine 4), it has its own physics system, fluent animations (aside from not so reponsive keys), and highly detail for both the environment and characters.

If I didn't want buggs I should't have bought an early access game. Allthough I will rant about a loooot of other things. First of wich will be the ''unique take on survival''.\n\nI haven't played any hardcore survival games, but I have played some casual ones, like Rust wich I enjoy a lot and I will compare The black death to it a little. In Rust you have a food and drink bar which is easy to refill and keep a good health, yet I have found myself dying from starvation from time to time. In The Black Death you basically can't die from starvation unless you have no hands or feet to move your mouse and keyboard. It is insanely easy to stay alive.\nThe uniqueness must then come from the plague right? No... The plague in The Black Death should be kind of a big problem and you should need to be scared to get it, especially in the capitol. But even the people with no hand nor feet will get the plague because it's only in this tiny tiny villege in the bottom of the map. You cannot name your game ''The Black Death'' and not make people worried about getting the plague. You as a midieval peasant, merchant or militia, are never in danger of dying.\n\nWich brings me to the next point, classes.\nThere are for now 3 playable classes: the peasant, he can farm and carry a lot, the merchant who can trade and craft and the militia who can make some weapons and fight better and has more health. There are 3 more classes wich aren't available right now which are: the smith, the monk and the hunter. In an open world set in the dark ages, i would like to see  a no class system. You are a person, afraid of the plague and wanting to survive. So don't give me the bull*** of: ''you need to be a farmer if you want to plant some crops.'' But that is just a personal thing. What isn't personal is the lack of depth your character has. The abilities are very, very basic and there is no character customisation. Yeah that's right, you can't change the way your ugly face looks.\n\nWhat I see in a lot of early access games is the lack of depth and content. Making a game early access is a way to let the community see what you're doing, not to show us what still needs to be done. Also I noticed more and more crowdfunded or early accecs games are focusing on 1 particular thing in their game, this time it's the plague. Being so focused on 1 thing will make the rest of the game empty and meaningless.\n\nYet I have not lost my hope. The graphics are pretty good and like the devs said the foundation is built. There just needs to be a lot of work done. Too much to put it in early access allready, at least that's my opinion.\n\nFor now i won't recommend buying it. Maybe wait for 3~5 months to see where the devs are then. Maybe the game will be great by then and when people read this they will get upset. I don't know. you don't know, nobody knows. That's the mystery of early access.\n\n","May 10","false","6.8"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","2"

In under an hour I gained 12 skill levels and filled out most of the skill branches.\n\nHousing has potential.

TBH it was brought to Early Access way too soon. It appears the team behind it have only one other project to their name that as yet has not been finished/released and the Kickstarter for that project failed.\n\nResearching a little, it seems that the team seems to be on the young side with little real experience of running even a small professional games development studio. Many little pointers hint at such, which I feel does not reassure me that they have the required business and development skills to pull this project off to a successful conclusion.\n\nAt the moment, handing over your money seems to be a very risky gamble as nothing as yet indicates this will not flop or fade away like many other EA fails. Hopefully I am wrong but after having experienced quite a few EA titles, one starts to get a feel for them.","April 24","false","14.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","2"

I feel this game is pretty promising , being early release and still buggy well thats an issue but it is early release and they have done alot of work to the game, yes there is still alot to do but the developers seem to be working hard since they were able to put out a HUGE update 1 week after release so i beleive there is alot of potential and i would recommend more people coming on board, if you refunded this game then i would suggest buying it back cause i have faith that the developers will be adding soo much more to this game in the upcoming months.","April 27","true","18.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

This game is amazing and i'm being very serious. It has an amazing theme. It basically screams out RPG to those who have the patience for it (more on this in a sec). Its very very alppha but thats ok as long as the devs continue like I think they are continuing the RPG community will have another fantastic world to geek out in. Now on to the impatience part. This game is not for little children nor any one who suffers from a major ADD disorder and by that i mean someone who scream out this after slaughtering the entire server.... (LOL GET REKT SKRUBMEMES, THIS GAME SUCKS YOU ALL ARE LOSERS!!!). If you are that type of person DO NOT buy this game before growing up and learning basic english and grammar skills.\n\nThis game is for a sorta dumbed down D&D type of nerd. You can Role Play if you wanted to ( which will be this games major point and is probly why so many people are rating it down because\n1.) They are either too impatient to enjoy countless hours of being a improptu village lord or cell guard   or\n2.) They're just not into that type of stuff and are trying to warn other people. I LOVE RPG style games so I will support this game to its fullest and those of you who are interested in it I need to say wait maybe a week or two after purchase then come back and see what it has too offer at a more stable period. Don't just down vote it because you lagged out on your potatoe or you got stuck in a tree and had to restart. This game literally just came out. Also have you ever tried coding? If you haven't imaginge your video editing a entire days worth of footage then times that by a 100 and then check to see if your math skill is at 100. If all those following requirments have been meet then you may have the liberty to down vote this game only after playing about an hour with your TS mates.\n\nP.S.

This game is in -very- early Alpha, arguably early enough it should have been associated with a kickstarter style campaign if they were looking for an influx of cash to finish it, instead of attempting to release it in a playable state to the public. So obviously buyer beware; it runs the gambit of every error you can imagine from texture & lighting flaws, rudimentary AI pathing/behavior, scripting errors, server instability, animation glitches, unresponsive and broken UI elements, lack of customization, features, etc.\n\nAll that aside, and I am sincere when I say this, this title holds a great deal of potential. I do not regret the purchase at $9.99 and hope to see the game improve into what the developers envision for it. If you have a tight gaming budget, then skip it; but if you like the idea of this game and the potential it has if it ever reaches a finished state; then for the price of some bagels and a decent cup of coffee it's worth it.","May 9","true","28.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's a shame the lack of attention this game gets in regards to updates and such. The gameplay is rather shoddy for an early Alpha, most of the stuff in game doesn't even work; I'd rather have place holders than be able to select things that don't work, while thinking it's me. Overall, I'll keep watching and waiting, I like it though think it really has a long way to go. For the Price tag at such an early state it is sort of robbery, It should be lowered in price or get much more love from the developers.

The whole game world is far too buggy to even do anything other than run around yelling huehuehue to yourself since there's no VOIP.\n\nThe game looks and feels like a college/uni project where a class has literally built the game using basic unreal engine tutorials. The animations are horrible, even for placeholder animations, there's not even basic sound effects. Nearly all "settings" are missing from the games menu...\n\nServer stability is a massive issue, it took me 7 attempts to connect to a server. Each time the game fails to connect, you have to restart the game....\n\nFor other games that have come out recently on early acesss using the same engine, there is literally no excuse....\n\nI'd personally hold off on purchasing and seeing if the game goes anywhere in the next few weeks/months but judging so far, its not even in an acceptable early acess state and should still be an internal build.","April 19","false","0.3"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","18","39","0","0"

Only 25 players on most US servers and 50 players max on EU servers.\n\n2) This one goes with problem 1 because I cannot even connect to any server without the game throwing an error. This error prompts me to restart my game and when I do and return to the game, it throws the same error again (loops). I was once able to connect to a server in Moscow, but I only played for about 2 min before the game crashed. I also live in the Midwest, so a Chicago server would be the closest to me, but I couldn't even connect to it.\n\nConclusion: Wait before you purchase this game! I hate to say this because I was following this game for awhile before it came out and I was really excited to get to play it on Day 1 (today), but I can't even write a review on the gameplay because I cannot even connect to any server to get to play it.\n\nOne last thing, I will change this (current) review over time, as the game development progresses and gets better.","April 19","false","0.7"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","17","37","4","0"

However i am still going to put in another negative review because i am tired of playing the load game. 1 hour or 2 hour does not matter. A review is someones opinion and they all should be respected negative or positive. You should not tell someone how to vent their opinion. They tried the game even if it was for 1 minute they still tried it and decided they did not like it for whatever reason.\n\nEARLY ACCESS : I hope they come out with a patch asap, I have high hopes for this game and still do. Every time i enter the world i last 3-7 mins before i have to ALT CTRL DELETE and force close.\n\nExamples In game errors:\nI go to a barrel and loot it, game locks up.\nI type in chat game locks up\nWhen i kill animals my game locks up to where im the only one moving in world\nWhen i open my inventory and create items, again my game locks up i have to exit out.\nWhen i drop items my game locks up.\n\nTrying to join servers errors:\nI go to a server with ping under 100 game just loads than sends me back to start menu. Than when i click server it tells me to restart game.\n\nPositives :\nWhen the game does load it just takes 1 min to 2 mins. Not like life is feudal if you played that game before where it can take 5-10 mins just to start. Least The Black Death has a decent loading time.\nGraphics are good.\nThis game has a'lot going for it and i am hoping for a patch soon to make it playable. I do think they need to act fast before they lose the fan base they have right now. Especially from someone like me who loves the game life is feudal and the servers are just dead. This gam reminds me of it.\n\nNegatives :\nBesides the bugs,\nThe attack is kinda slow and cheezy at this point.\nNo creation mode on character so we all look the same. Such as skin, hair, beard, tatts ex...\nStill trying to figure out the zones but there are camps i do not get.\nOn the map it does not show where i am, i do not know if its me doing something wrong or just an early access thing.\n\nSo in the end i have to give this game a negative review. But do not get me wrong, Wait for that patch to come out and for this game to be playable. Do not always go by negative reviews. Do not go by how much time someone has spent on the game. Because a review is someones opinion and they cannot be wrong for giving it no matter how long they played a game. Opinions can change, does not mean they were wrong. I have spend maybe 15-20 mins playing this game, Last i checked i was at 73 mins. So the rest was loading and failing to join servers and game crashing. It is not my computer because i play arma 3 all day everyday with 120 people on the best settings. So again i get the game is early access, all these bugs are expected. I also expect them to get fixed over time. This is my review, if you have any TIPS, or suggestions for this game. Please post in the comments box so i can read them and the devs can read them. I want to make this game work but i cannot give a positive review, i would not be helping the devs. Thanks for reading......","April 19","false","2.5"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","14","31","0","0"

Despite the broken servers and the fact the servers stop responding every 15 minutes, even if that was perfect, the AI of npcs is non-existent, the world is almost completely barren of anything fun except exploration.\n\nThe fighting, even with all three attacks with all three mouse buttons is sluggish and slow, and the hitboxes on both other players and npcs is broken resulting in fighting looking utterly ridiculous and down-right silly.\n\nRight now, this game is just a good idea severely missing on its target and I'd put that game at 10% complete.  I'd highly recommend waiting on this one until at least mid-summer or fall of 2016 and then looking back at the reviews and see how the developers have handled the criticism and how many updates there are.\n\nI myself will look back at this game in a few months to re-review it because it's not even close to being ready to have much fun in at this point.","April 19","false","1.7"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","14","32","0","0"

It is very rough and full of bugs. I understand this is pre-alpha and still in development, but this is barely a game at this stage. I am no stranger to Steam's refund policy, and have used it several times.........However, something about this game interests me so will keep it installed in my library - checking back often to see progress. I can see the potential here and being a fan of the multiplayer survival genre I am excited to see this game mature. Particularly if the community get's behind the RP part of the game. I have given The Black Death a 'thumbs up', but if you are thinking of buying this game, be aware of what Early Access means and don't expect a polished product for some time.","April 20","true","0.7"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

What that means, is that this game is currently IN DEVELOPMENT, meaning that most of the features are not present at this time. By purchasing this game you are pretty much DONATING your money to the developers to keep the production of the game up and running smooth according to their schedule. I absolutely LOVE early access games and usually take part in most of them, especially survival games.\n\nWith that being said. I purchased this game and it is exactly what it is advertised as if you read up on it at all, which you always should do if you are purchasing an early access game.\n\nThe games atmosphere and environment design is absolutely beautiful and stunning. There is a crafting, combat, and leveling system implemented at this point which is awesome. I haven't even played that long yet due to work, but I can assure you that this game has tons of potential. Yes, day 1 and 2 are still a bit rough around the edges so don't expect to by this game and jump in as fast as you jump into your CSGO matches. Its ALPHA, which for those of you who are unaware, comes before BETA. This game is very bare at the moment, but you can still run around, explore, craft, and gather materials. Just exploring the landscape alone is amazing!\n\nI would definitely recommend this game if you like supporting early access games and small dev teams. This game has tons of potential and I can't wait to see what they have in store for it. The devs do a great job at keeping the community updated and aware of features and bug fixes at all times. Solid dev team right here.\n\nA+ Devs, keep up the great work!\n\nP.S. I am running this game on the highest settings with NO MOTION BLUR on my sytem at a solid 60+ FPS at all times. I have an i7 4770 and a GTX 970.","April 20","true","1.3"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","11","26","2","1"

It was also a very quiet time, with combat leaving no sound behind when someone was stricken.\n\nI strongly suggest anyone with a very high interest in realistic history games buy this.","April 19","true","1.7"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","42","14","33","5","0"

But at the moment,even with my monster MSI laptop, the game doesn't run as good as I thought it would. Perhaps later the graphics will grab some optimization.\nSo far the most annoying thing was the sound of crackling fire, over and over again. Tried the combat system, but heck, I couldn't tell when i parried and when i hit the fella, because the sound got messed up.

But I am sure that will change with coming updates.\n\nOverall, It is an early access game. You buy at your own risk, it clearly says that on the store page, so don't complain when it's not a perfect finished game the day of release. That being said, I think the concept and execution are fantastic! I love how each class has a distinct role on the server and how a server must have all of the classes present in order to be the best it can be. (No 'sniper spammers' like in COD. Everyone plays differently) I am hoping to have VOIP soon but thats a minor problem.

These are just the issues I've had with the game:\n\n-You have to select a screen resolution in the settings before vsync is toggleable, even when it is selected, it somehow turns it off.\n\n-You have to be in game to change the motion blur, this should be in the settings on the main menu.\n\n-Intermittant server issues, sometimes they'll be up for a few mins, other times your buttons will stop working and get disconnected without so much an answer.   I'd give some leeway with the servers, they did just release to EA after all, but there was a server with just 4-5 peopl on it and it crashed.\n\n-Almost no content really.  There are some NPCs you can interact with, but most don't give a care.  You can steal without worrying about the guards, same with killing players.  Only 3 classes to choose from, with 3 more being locked.  Animals are pretty uncommon.  I walked for a half hour or so and only saw 3-4 boar and a few cows.\n\n\nI would've liked to have seen fewer NPCs, maybe have fewer villages, towns, and cities, and as a player build them.

The servers weren't quite up to the task and the first evening I was not able to play for even a second. But!! That same evening the developers already came with an update! That is fast response! They are also active on the Steam community, which does not always happen with Early Access games.\n\nWhat should you know about the game?\nIf you like survival games and medieval times, and you don't mind early access with its flaws and bugs. BUY THIS GAME, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT!\nIt looks very nice with the Unreal 4 engine and the team has so far managed to capture the feel of being free in nature or really walking through a medieval city. The open gutters on the streets, rubbish laying about in front of the main gates, foilage and bushes that sometimes cover part of the path, rivers, streams, waterfalls, caves... It's all there!\n\nIt need a lot of work still, but that is to be expected from Early Access. The servers aren't very stable yet so you'll be switching a lot between several servers for the moment. I'm sure this will be fixed in the future, though.\n\nNo, there's still not too much to do in the game at the moment except basic survival, basic crafting and a lot of exploring. Some of the towns are placed but are not finished yet but are looking pretty darn cool already, some of the animations are still a bit weird, so your character will be walking bent over like a sack of potatoes quite a bit and stabbing himself twice with a sword when he "puts it away".\nIt's easy to make money for the moment because you can steal stuff from a merchant and then sell him back his own stuff. If you want a bit more satisfaction you can pick cotton, craft bandages and sell those for 10g a piece.\n\nThis exploration game (at the moment) really is for those who have been waiting for a survival game with a medieval setting and want to start playing this game to help the developers by reporting bugs, introducing ideas and be part of early access.\nIf you're looking for a finished game with little bugs and stable servers, you might want to wait a bit, still.\n\nSo far, I'm loving this game and I'm curious about what the developers will bring in the future updates!","April 21","true","48.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","3"

The bare minimum of any reasonably good game falls to proficient coding: though there may be bugs that require restart and other methods to find a solution, I don't think I've ever participated in any alpha that has completely prevented me from playing the game at all.\n\nFor now, I'd like to recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to wait until the product improves with age, but if you're not that kind of consumer than I'd suggest you pour your money into a game that has seen a few revisions.

I do hope that there are enough early adopters to keep it alive long enough to see a more completed version. It's a risk if you do buy in to it this early and for me it's worth the risk due to some really cool concepts.\n\nSadly, I can't give a review of this game as there's really not much gameplay to be had at the moment. In it's current state it's a walking simulator at best. You can craft some items but I was unable to equip the stick I'd created. Simple tasks like that simply don't work.\n\nI think the biggest draw for me is the penalty for murder. Games like Rust focus much less on the realistic survival atmosphere and instead take a brutal carnage approch. Hopefully they manage to incentivize players enough so that they only initiate combat when it's really needed or when the person stands to gain more than they will lose.\n\nI'm also looking forward to what might amount to be a rather indepth player economy. So far, each class serves a purpose in that chain - in theory.\n\nSo if you can put up with a laundry list of issues and hope to see a final version some day. I'd say you could spend your money on much worse things.","April 20","true","1.7"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

Interestingly, a good new of these comments are from "so-called" players, who seem  have spent less than an hour - in some cases fewer than 20 minutes - actually trying out and exploring the game.   Their contributions are utter bollox and not worth paying any attention to.\n\nFirst play through, I spent an hour and half on a London server, during which time I experienced only one crash.  Yes, there are a variety of bug and glitches, but these don't materially detract from what already an amazing game!  Forget potential, in a few weeks when the servers are fully stabilised and some balancing has been undertaken, this will be a fantastic PvP and yet it could surpass everything in this space else when further content and mechanics have been added.\n\nThe attention to detail that the developers have invested in authentically capturing medieval Europe at the height of the plague is truly breathtaking, while the combination of multiplayer RPG and survival genres deliver a uniquely rich  and highly enjoyable gameplay mechanic.  Character classes are currently restricted to Merchant, Peasant and Militia, with at least another 6 options to be introduced over the coming months.  Each character possess a different set of skills that can be used to carve out an advantage in different areas of the game.\n\nOver and above KOSs and NPCs, hunger prevails as a risk factor, but so does the very real chance of contracting the plague, an incurable killer.  This adds an extra dynamic to the gameplay strategy, since it interactions with sick players and exploring plague-infested dwellings will mean a high chance of infection.\n\nThe crafting mechanics are easy to pick up and a quick scan of the menus reveals a lot of diverse content to be unlocked, as your character develops.  Often, to craft a more complex item or to cook food requires you to find one of the many tools (ovens/anvils/tannery) dotted around the game (mainly in the cities).  The hunger rate seems to be pretty manageable, as you can collect plenty of berries, steal food or kill various animals roaming the countryside (don't kill anything in the towns or the guards will come down on you!) to stave this off.\n\nThe graphical fidelity and animation of Unreal 4 is sublime on ultra settings, and I comfortably achieved 60fps throughout my play through.  In terms of immediate issues, the developers need to introduce VOIP, as I'm damned if I am going to type as I try and defend myself against a bunch of KOSs, and provide a volume setting!  Also, when the servers do crash you lose progress and any house you might have bought, which is major pain.\n\nOverall, the game reminds a lot of Rust, Chivalry, The Forest and 7 Days to Die.  The great thing is the game is already tremendous fun and will get even better.","April 22","true","2.6"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

I know this game is gonna be really great, but not right now! At the moment there is a few issues, i can deal with that others cant. Game crahses/blackscreen and so on. Game is an openworld sandbox, survival mmo. You choose from 3 base classes , millitia, merchant or peasant, all with diffrent talents, all with diffrent pros/cons. which evolves into deeper classes later on ( not unlocked atm ) for example, militia has advanced class Blacksmith, while merchant have monk, and lasly as we know so far peasant have the hunter as advanced class. The game is full pvp loot, which means, you can kill other players and take there hard earned coin, so play safe or go in grp if you dont wanna risk getting killed by a damn bandit ;) You need to make a living, earn your coin in this world. Right now, your talents isnt saved after you relog or server crashes, which makes it kinda pointless to play, because you dont progress you character.. But if you just wanna see the game, see what it can be and how fun it can be to explore, get the game. bit imo it is better to wait a few more month till they added more stuff and got the game running alil better! I will support this game and i hope you do to, the game is gonna evolve into something many will call i master piece, but we need the player to send feedback to the devs to help them achive that. And lastly this is an early alpha, and we all know what that means, there is always problem with alphas, so dont judge this great game because it it a little bit empty atm or the game crashes, see beyound that, see the future, see the master piece! :) haha!

Certainly well worth the short wait - the immersive medieval game environment is simply stunning to behold, especially for an EA title!  Big thumbs up to Unreal Engine 4, which delivers in spades incredible graphics and wonderfully fluid interactive gameplay.\n\nIt is clear the developers have played a lot of games in the survival genre, as the design bears all the hallmarks of the best titles (Rust/DayZ/LIF etc), while adding in a refreshing RPG aspect in the form of different character classes (Merchant/Peasant/Militia currently), whose skills can be enhanced over time to unlock new classes (Hunter/Blacksmith etc).  This alone has the potential to make this game HUGE and stand out from everything else in the marketplace.  I opted for Merchant to ensure I started with some gold and could immediately trade.\n\nIn addition to the usual hunger threat and being killed by marauding PvP/NPCs, there is the added risk of developing the bubonic plague which is incurable, although its progress can be slowed until your eventual death.  Respawning should allow you to inherit past items/gold, but it seems the save functionality isn't currently working - developers have said this is a priority hot fix mercifully.\n\nUnlike in Rust where you can build and customise your own houses, this game allows you to purchase one of the many buildings already constructed and scattered across the map (cities/villages/farms/remote outhouses).  Avoid the ones marked with a red X or else you're guaranteed to catch or accelerate the plague!  The crafting options for items (food/weapons/tools/clothes etc) are richly diverse and really well thought through, requiring the player to harvest or loot the necessary base materials (food ingredients/wood/stone/cotton/animal hides etc) and locate the right equipment (anvil/oven/tannery etc) in order to transform them into more useful and valuable stuff.\n\nYou can trade items with NPCs and other players at the town marketplaces to earn gold, which I found pretty straightforward pick up.  But venturing out into the amazingly realised countryside is much more dangerous since the protection afforded by the in town militia disappears and you are more prone to being killed by ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• KOS players.  Noticed more glitches/bugs outside the city - floating grass & mystical disappearance of rivers when switching to first person viewer - but for an EA title the game environment is in fantastic shape and perhaps needs more collectible items, crafting equipment and NPCs/animals to enrich the gameplay even further.  Minor quibble!\n\nOverall, a tremendous RPG survival game already that has all the potential of being the very best around.  Can't wait to see where the developers take it over the next few months in terms of expanding content, functionality and continuing to squish bugs.  Keep up the brilliant work!!\n\nP.S Please make the Motion Blur a main menu setting option! :-)","April 20","true","0.9"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

So to start. I‚Äôll point out what I liked. The graphics are GREAT. The game runs SMOOTH. No stutters, nothing. The atmosphere is exactly like what I‚Äôd want in this type of game. I see it as a medieval version of DayZ or some such zombie survival game. Minus the zombies, but just as desolate. I like the looting system as it keeps to games like H1Z1 and DayZ with an easy to figure out looting system. Now for the negative. BUT realize at the point of this review the game was JUST released to EARLY ACCESS two days ago. So they may change in time. -Combat is tricky. Not impossible, but it‚Äôs odd. -Minimal to no instructions, so it‚Äôs hard to figure out what to do. -Lack of content as to weapons, and such, that I could figure out so far. -At this moment stats do not save? (So I have heard) Now for those who are complaining. Most of what the say is how should I say... Exaggerated... A little... Maybe a lot. 1. LONG LOAD TIMES!!! Yes. It takes time to load. Like five minute. Maybe. Five into the game, another five into the server? Max of ten minutes to get playing. FAR from 2 hours so yeah. 2. CONSTANT CRASHES! Well I haven‚Äôt had it crash once. They patched it after release so it crashes less. I haven‚Äôt played long enough to say it DOESN‚ÄôT crash, but, heck it can‚Äôt crash every five minutes less I just got real lucky. 3. INVISIBLE WALLS EVERYWHERE! K... That is probably the biggest one yet. I ran into... One. I went to bout four cities, two docks, and the capitol. One wall, which was inside a house. A little odd, but that is all. No large areas of content not available. Mostly, If I saw it I could get to it. So yeah. The game IS early access BUT that DOES mean the game should NOT be in FULL playable form. YES it should be playable, and it is. It will take time to be amazing, but I think this game has potential, and will do great. TL;DR: YES it‚Äôs Early Access. Which, if you didn‚Äôt know, means you want to support the developer in MAKING the game. It needs work so don‚Äôt buy it yet if your not okay with an unfinished product. The games got the atmosphere down, that alone makes it a epic game to try, and I think it‚Äôs got the drive to go far. Let‚Äôs not down it cause it‚Äôs not made it there yet.","April 21","true","2.2"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"

It's Early Access. It's stated in Large Bold Lettering. And it has server issues. I think we all can understand server issues. They happen for any promising game that releases on the first day. We can assume they will be resolved shortly. The devs seem really involved with the community based off their comments in the steam discussion page. This is a large plus. The gameplay itself is pretty bland as of now. NPCs are currently not working effectively to say the least. And there's lots of glitches and bugs that should be worked out.. We can only hope soon. But the players make the gameplay in my opinion. This game has a large appeal, I believe, to players that like to roleplay in an medieval period. There's emotes that allow you to greet and laugh among others that brings the game some immersive elements. I noticed a player coming at me with a sharp object in his hand. I simply throw up a say "hello" emote. He replies with his own emote, a wave of his hand and off he went just ignoring me looking for another poor soul to attack. But what I think that's going to really hit home and bring this game some longevity is it allows you to select a profession, which is a pretty neat option in a survival game. You perform tasks relating to your profession, which ranges from a peasant, who can plant crops and harvest them. A merchant who can craft an abundance of items and sell them, or a militia, who is efficient at combat. You can unlock three other professions as you progress through the game and more to come as the game updates. This allows for an even more immersive setting with not everyone starting off as the same person. Aside from that. be aware this is a permadeath game. When you die you lose your stuff, but you inherit your home if you purchased one. Purchasing a home is pretty important and pretty awesome as well. When you purchase a home in a server it stays in that server forever until you decide to purchase another home. You can only own one home per character/account? from what I've read. The homes allow you to keep your goods/gold in your very own stash. So if a player were to kill you or you die, hopefully you put your precious goods in your stash at home. Otherwise, you lost everything on you. All in all this game really shows promise. It definitely has its bugs that will be worked out in the long run, but try and endure those and join the community in making the game what its set out to be. The Black Death. An immersive survival game that makes you think about your well being. Constantly.","April 19","true","2.5"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

Wait...Well, yeah, that is why!\n\nThe Black Death (Review):\n\n$17.99 Right Now!!!\n\nI am a player. Just like you, I wanted something to spend my time on with a small return of persistent character skills, experience and progression. The Black Death is just that kind of game. An RPG, open world, where there are few holds barred.\n\nI woke up in a field with my hands as my only tool. I ventured off into the woods, collected some items then headed to the mountains where I knew the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• might hit the fan... it did not happen there. I became disoriented because my (M)ap did not detail where I am located nor where I might find some NPC's to check the economy.\n\nSo I wandered to a bridge, 'Capitol Bridge', and found a keep with merchants, tools, foods, utilities (for crafting) and much more. In fact, I purchased a house for $1000 coin and found a better 3 BR, 8 Storage w/Bed just down the street.\n\nNote to self: Don't rush to buy real estate. EON.\n\nSo the game dumped me many times. The servers reset many times. I downloaded a patch (which tells me that the devs were working late (9pm EST)).\n\nIt's Alpha -this means that the entire game may change before release. With the purchase, $17.99, I have helped fund an ongoing project to release, a very interesting game, to say the least.\n\nThe exp system works. You gain exp from just about everything and can (L)earn Class Skills with those level ups. The fight mechanics are not very smooth but better than all the medeviel games out right now...surprise on that huh?\n\nI mash an attack button (or mouse click) and the weapon moves instantly toward my target. No cheesy block moves to time...just swing, hit, kill.\n\nThe graphics are crazy! I am running in Ultra Mode without a single glitch. FPS is super-duper (for me) on a WIN10, 4Ghz, 16g, 8 Core w/390 gpu. FPS has not come up as a global chat player concern during my review.\n\nI have heard that you can kill NPC's?!? Not verified. But, one can certainly 'steal merchandise' as you scamper through towns and such trying to survive. Inside these towns, and perhaps across the lands, Deeds can be purchased with coin from selling loot. The coinage for loot is mediocre, at best. You just won't get rich selling apples.\n\nThe game just released ALPHA and I am excited to see where it goes from here. STEAM is a great company and platform for making dreams come true for the INDIES as well as the big boys! Thanks for that STEAM.\n\nI wish I could get paid for reviews but nah, I make too much money on my day job.\n\nPlease be patient with this one. Yes. They are working around the clock to get to Beta (which probably is not that far away). I like what they write in response to issues that arise from loads. U4 is a great engine on any network code and certainly shines in this persistent world of The Black Death.","April 19","true","26.0"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

This game has some great potential the devs are keeping us updated as much as possible with the current server issues and it doesnt seem to be lets get their money and run. So i decided to invest 18 dollars into the game to see what i could do and mayybe help the devs give them ideas and report bugs. They jumped the gun, big time from what i can see the game crashes alot, has no audio menu to change the the sound levels ( they do have a sport for it thought) Loading times are a bit long, and if you can get in a server dont expect to be in it long, you will crash. The animations in game are laggy and so are the servers, The chat is hard to read sometimes due to the fact that some of the letters when typed dont show up on your side while typing or on the server side when it is able to be read by everyone.This game shouldnt have been released to the public for another few months. Devs if you are reading this get a small team of game testers, lets say 15-20 people. get them a server that only they can get on and get them testing. Whether it be people from the community or your own team. Take it a step back without dissapointing your fans. Once again this game has some great potential, im glad i bought it just to be able to help the devs get developing more and keep them in business.

But, hey that's what I expect, and have also experienced, with EA titles including other survival MMOs such as DayZ and Rust.  The developers here communicate superbly with the community and I have faith that they will address the major problems over the coming weeks, before turning their attention to balancing the gameplay and expanding out content/functionality.\n\nWhat there is by way of content and gameplay currently is incredible and in the short while that I have played the game I have enjoyed it far more than other survival games.  The harsh medieval setting is depicted fantastically, while the class system allowing you to pursue one of three career paths (Merchant/Militia/Peasant) is an excellent addition that forces you modify your approach to survival.  Above the usual threats of hunger and murdered in PvP/NPC encounters, there is also the prospect of developing the plague, for which there is no cure and whose progress can only be slowed.\n\nI loved the ability to purchase one of the many houses located in either the cities and surrounding countryside in order to store your belongings and rest up.  At the moment, there is sadly no option to build your own house, but hopefully that this will be a feature later down the line.\n\nThere is a huge area to explore across the map, with a few pointers to what might released by the developers later down the line.  I found, for example, a cave system which I could not access, but led me to think that mining might be a possibility, while the coastal port suggests the potential introduction of a fisherman class.\n\nMy one big frustration is the inability to save your progress, especially as this would counteract much of problems arising from server crashes.  Furthermore, combat is little rudimentary at present - you can choose one of three stance positions - and I'd like to see this developed out to benefit more skilled players.\n\nOverall, despite the well documented server issues, the game is a fantastic addition to the survival genre and has all the potential to be the very best in its class given time.  Keep up the good work and looking forward to seeing where this game goes!!","April 21","true","20.1"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

This means you have to start the gathering/ killing process all over again just to have the game stop leting you interact with the world once more, forcing a reset and putting you back to square one.\n\nWhile I see this game having a lot of potential in the future, until this issue is adressed the game is not worth the current ¬£14 asking price.

I would wait atleast 3-6 months for this to be any good at all. So far there are no critters to kill, the crafting is messed up and removes me from server if i press craft item. The fighting is very clunky and non responsive. If you buy this game know that this game will suck for awhile. However it does have promise with the ummm ahhh ill think of something redeemable i hope.","April 19","false","6.4"," 19 of 62 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","19","62","4","0"

The style of game will favour those that enjoy Life is Feudal or reign of kings, buts it's really to early to tell how it will develop. The concept and role of the players seems very promising\n\nThere are  alot of bugs -- every playthrough so far (about 8 logins) have resulted in the game crashing or becoming unstable -- there are floating objects, the sounds crash, crafting crash, looting\n\nFor it's price however, it is better than other alpha's I've played for more, which did pan out to be terrific games, so it gets a recommendation from me -- if in a month's time, nothings changed - then it'll get a thumbs down","April 19","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
