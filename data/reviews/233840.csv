"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Merkules/recommended/233840/","Merkules","[UGUF] Merkules","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Merkules/","579 products in account","This game is basically a standalone expansion to Revolution.  It's a much better game overall, and the workshop support is very cool, but you can't help but feel like a lot of this should have been in Revolution to begin with.\n\nThe problem with the game though, is that even though it's better than both Revolution and Reloaded, it's still a shadow of a game compared to Armageddon.  Sure, it has the same number of weapons and even lets you use the Armageddon HUD for your weapons, but that's really the only areas where it matches that old classic, and even then it replaces fun weapons from that game (such as the bow) with newer weapons that, honestly, just aren't as fun.\n\nThe graphics are decent, but you will have stutter and FPS drops even on decent rigs when you play games with a lot of onscreen objects/worms.  They've said for some time now they have been working on the FPS issues, but the fact I have not heard anything in a while combined with the fact that one update actually made my performance *worse*, doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.  Also, the game does not have an FPS cap on background objects, but the foreground objects are all animated at 30FPS.  It's incredibly awkward looking and makes it blatantly obvious the game was made using an engine designed for consoles, not exactly the grand "PC exclusive" we were promised.\n\nEven looking past that, it's just painfully obvious that you cannot have a game like this in 2.5D if you play for even just a decent amount.  You can't always tell just what it is you can actually stand on, not to mention if a chunk of landscape is small enough, you can't even see it at all (I even have proof of this in my screenshots for this game).  We do not gain a single thing going to 3D graphics, we only lose precision and performance.  Team 17, please stop trying to make Worms in 3D graphics.  If you want to do that, make another 3D Worms (and make a decent 3D camera while you're at it), because it's not like 2D graphics is some kind of forbidden thing to have in a video game these days.\n\nAdmittedly, all the new weapons and tools do serve their purpose and can be useful at times (to be honest, this is the first time in a Worms game I actually *like* using the mortar), but they range from fun to boring.  And frankly, one weapon isn't even new, the Bovine Blitz was already in Ultimate Mayhem, yet they act as if it is new (maybe to 2D Worms, but they should specify that instead of just saying it's new).  And everyone who cried that the rope is overpowered in Armageddon?  The water jetpack is far, far more unbalanced than the rope ever was (and the rope wasn't OP to begin with...but the aqua pack sure is).  To be fair though, the winged monkey is a very useful tool for stopping darksiders, and it's amusing to block someone between two physics objects and then go blast them out ("Oh, are you stuck?  Here, let me help you...heh heh heh").\n\nAs for the teleport gun being the compromise to the rope no longer allowing Armageddon levels of speed?  It's not a compromise at all, it's incredibly easy to use and has no real skill ceiling to it.  It's like whoever was in charge had no idea what it was about the rope that made it so fun to use.  Had it been developed with the mindset that you need to do a lot of practice to master it, it could have been something really cool, but it's a big disappointment if you're an old roper.  Team 17 needs to stop being so pigheaded about the rope and just revert it to the way it was before, because I just don't see how anyone could think the new rope or the teleport gun are more fun, even after having spent hours using both.\n\nBut let's say you can ignore all that, and are willing to play anyways.  What's that you say?  You want to play Hysteria?  Not possible because you can't fine tune the turn timer in this.  Bow and Arrow?  Haha, sorry, there is no bow in this.  Shopper?  You'll get bored when you realize the limitations of the rope.  Heck, you can't even really get crazy with something original, because...and this alone is *THE BIGGEST PROBLEM* with the game, and the series since Reloaded in my opinion...Team 17 keeps removing gameplay options with which to customize schemes.  We don't exactly gain anything worthwhile in their place either.  Frankly, the only reason this is better than Reloaded is because Reloaded's physics were just that bad, Reloaded has far more options than Clan Wars, and that game is only a few years old.\n\nI don't recommend any of the newer Worms games at all.  Not because I'm a die hard Armageddon fan (I actually preferred Hedgewars, back when it was more active), but because these games are cash grabs that have obvious signs of Team 17 just flat out being lazy, all while promising they are listening to the community and that this game will be "the best Worms yet".\n\nHeck, they barely acknowledge the old Armageddon fans, and make it pretty obvious they are not listening to their input on these games.  So...they want to build a game with an active community, yet all but shun the oldest fans unless they are willing to lavish praise on their half ♥♥♥♥♥ sequels?  And yet they wonder why the series has been losing fans.  They also tend to delete negative topics on their forums (even banning users for telling people how to get refunds on the Revolution board...myself included), and I wouldn't be surprised if this review gets flagged by them.\n\nSo why did I buy this?  Because I'm still a fan of Worms.  And it was cheap with a discount and trading card money.  But Team 17's rotten attitude and laziness make it extremely hard to like the new games.  I seriously doubt I'd ever buy any of their future games, Worms or not.  Not until they stop being all talk and actually make a game designed for people who don't just play casually (as casuals are less likely to notice a lack of depth or laziness on the developer's part).\n\nTL;DR version: Another half ♥♥♥♥♥ Worms game from Team 17.  One I wanted to like but I just can't.  Avoid unless you have to have every single Worms game ever, and even then, get it for at least 75% off, as $25 is nothing short of overpriced for this game, especially considering Armageddon is $15 on steam and will last you far longer.","August 15, 2013","false","79.0"," 102 of 129 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","102","129","3","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinkilla/recommended/233840/","Kinkilla","XxKinkillaxX™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinkilla/","615 products in account","Lets just say maybe you don't have a clue what "Worms" is. I think this is HIGHLY unlikely, and certainly embarrassing for you if that is true in anyway possible. The Worms of a decade ago is much the same as the Worms of today, with newer titles adding a few spins and twists on the classic formula but generally sticking to what made it work all these years to go\n\nBasically its just all the lovely new features from Worms Revolution have been retained by its wriggling, younger sibling: classes, water, and physics. Combatants are split up into soldiers, scouts, scientists, and heavies, all with different movement speeds, health, and special abilities, like the scientist worm's knack for healing his chums. They've been tweaked and balanced since Revolution, with area of effects for special abilities being added or increased.\n\nWhat makes Clan Wars above its predecessors is the effort that has been put into multiplayer. There's local multiplayer, then your standard online PvP, but the truly special, properly new addition is the titular clan feature. With the same tools used to make a team of deadly, slimy worm-warriors, you can put together a whole clan, with a distinct appearance along with a shiny emblem and a clan name, and then recruit members to this clan, not that it matters at all since the pvp on this title is most likely dead or with 1-10 players.\n\nUltimately, its success lies in its ability to maintain a healthy population, which certainly won't happen if Team 17 keep churning out more Worm titles, so one hopes that they will take a breather. If Revolution was the best that Worms had ever been then this definently is a title worth having.","November 28, 2014","true","29.9"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","25","31","5","0"

I took advantage of the package deal and got this Worms game along with several others. Note this is a first impression review.\n\nWorms Clan Wars is an 2.5D artillery game where you control teams of Worms to defeat the other teams. You use a wide selection of weaponry and tools to secure victory. Sometimes in hilarious ways. Gameplay wise this is no Armaggedon but it comes close.\n\nEven when you lose or do something daft you can always laugh about it. In one case, I was going to do a classic tactic of using a baseball bat to send an enemy worm into the water, only instead for the worm to catch onto a piece of landscape, I was still laughing afterwards.\n\nUnlike most Worms games including Armaggedon, you have several classes of Worms to use. The Soldier is basically the standard Worm, but gains the ability to detonate grenades at any time. The Scout is a weaker, but faster Worm that doesn't set of mines. The Heavy is a slow, but tough worm that does extra damage. The Scientist is similar to the Solider but can heal itself and its teammate each turn whilst producing better tools. You can configure your team to adapt to this.\n\nOnline Gameplay is fun, and even when something daft happens you can still enjoy it and the clan features are nice.\n\nThe only criticism I have is the modded in cosemtic options, which with some items like that Master Chief helmet can really cause the lag in an online game to go theough the roof and with a rather low spec computer it has firced me to quit several times.\n\nDefinately recommend giving this game a shot!","October 28, 2015","true","7.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","22","26","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jukettaja/recommended/233840/","jukettaja","Jukettaja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jukettaja/","162 products in account","Clan Wars is probably the most innovative Worms game to date offering the same diversity of classes as Revolution albeit with some tweaks for balancing.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with them:\nSoldiers are the same regular worms from all other games except they can choose when to detonate grenades.\nHeavies have the most damage and biggest explosions but are slower and (obviously) heavier.\nScouts are more mobile with longer jumps and are light enough to avoid triggering mines but deal less damage.\nScientists heal friendly worms in a small radius at the start of their turn and all constructions (girders, turrets, magnets, etc.) are more durable but they also deal reduced damage.Weapons variety is largely the same as in Revolution from the traditional bazooka to some of the more wacky ones, many of which have multiple uses, like the Lightning Strike allowing you to heal worms, resurrect dead ones, convert turrets and activate inactive mines and magnets. Unlike classic Worms and Armageddon the Ninja Rope functions more like a rope than a mix between a rope and a ladder, meaning you'll weigh it down and have to use your momentum to swing around. Other mobility items, both old and new to the genre, include such items as Jetpack, Water Jetpack and Teleport Gun to name but a few.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes Clan Wars is an optimized Revolution meaning no lag when water sloshes about. However, both games are made in the same engine which limits animations to 30 frames per second regardless of what fps the actual game runs on. Note the game itself can run above 30 fps; only the worm animations are limited.\n\nSo all in all I think it's one of the freshest Worms games out there since Armageddon.","July 15, 2015","true","9.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Team17 are just after some more money and this wouldn't have been a problem if this title was indeed bringing something new and better than the previous. But unfortunately is worse, way worse than anyone could imagine coming from an engine that shouldn't have suffered in such a short time.\n\nProblems such as multi-player de-synchs, audio effects cutting off mid-game, usually after the first round, and framerate drops are plaguing it. There are very few additions in terms of weapons and their area of effect seems rather limited.  They feel completely unsatisfying. Also don't be fooled by the contraptions you see in the snapshots. They're not available in multiplayer.\n\nI won't talk about the clans because neither I nor my friends are interested in building some sort of reputation amonst unknown players. But if you're after this sort of entertainment, you won't find any people to play against.\n\nIn the end, all I've got to say about this title is that if you're after shiny graphics buy Worms Revolution instead, otherwise stick with the classic titles in this series, most notable Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party, where you get a pletora of satisfying weapons to decimate your friends with.\n\nThe trend nowadays seems to be: throw to the bin a good game, apply a fresh layer of paint on top of a shaky new engine, ignore some good ideas from the successful releases in the franchise, and sell it in whatever shape it is. The good old reputation won't keep this franchise afloat for too long, Team17.","March 21, 2014","false","10.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

It looked very fun, with its numerous weapons of mass destruction, from dynamite to a bazooka. I really thought that I would love this slapstick-humor filled game, especially when playing with friends. But, unfourtatently, after playing only about 20 mintues of it (I admit, not enough to form a very good opinion of a game), I knew that my overall feeling for the game could be summed up by one word; "Eh". It was only okay. It had a rather odd set up that confused me. I wasn't sure if I should be focusing on the multiplayer aspect of the game or the single-player campaign. The tutorial, too, confused me. Not that it was a complicated game, but more that unless I was in a perfect position, playing with my friends, forming clans and the like, I would not get much out of the game. Another big problem was the controls, which I tried for about 10 mintues to adjust to my liking, yet none of the combinations appealed to me. It would simply not let me change to controls to allow my mouse to play a bigger part than it was. I didn't feel comfterable with having to adjust my aim for my bazooka with the arrow keys, especially when on a turn timer. Overall, I had a lousy experience with Worms: Clan Wars, but that doesn't mean that you should not give it a try. Just do a little more research than I did to find out wether it's your kind of game or not. To me, It simply was not enticing enough.","December 27, 2013","false","1.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You'll probably hate it!\nFan of the series from newest titles? You'll probably love it!\nNever heard of it? Continue reading:\n\nWorms Clan Wars is a turn-based strategy game where you control a team of worms with one mission: kill all the non-beliver worms controlled by everyone else. There are four classes of worm to use to customize your army:\n\n- The Soldier, which is the average worm that you start with with no special traits other than manually detonating grenades.\n- The Heavy, which is very slow and cannot jump/jet high, but is bulky and makes a bigger explosive on death or by using dynamite.\n- The Scout, which is very agile, can jump/jet higher, fit into small spaces, see crate contents & doesn't set off mines, but is very weak in health and can be pushed around quite easily.\n- The Scientist, which is similar to the Soldier, in that it is average save that it heals your teammates on its turn for 5 points each and makes magnets or sentries last longer and do be more effective, but they also take more damage from weapons.\n\nOverall really, you either love it or hate it, but if you get it, play with friends with voice (better if using Mumble or Skype) as it's typically much more fun this way (and you can persuade a friend to kill someone else instead of you). The game is a steal on sale, even though I haven't clocked many hours yet (my friends won't play it :/), but with the 4-pack split among your friends it's even cheaper.","February 21, 2014","true","2.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

To be honest, it almost feels like a beta version of Worms Revolution.\n\nHere are just some negative points in this game:\n- You can not zoom the camera to the point you want, for me it's either too close or too far, which makes it difficult to play this game. In Worms Revolution it was easy to zoom the camera to the point I enjoyed.\n- Fat worms leave a massive explosion behind, feels unbalanced\n- Whats the point with the name? Worms is not meant to be a clan-game.\n- The environments are not as interesting as in Worms Revolution and they even don't look as good. Sadly they did not include the environment from Worms Revolution in this game.\n\nI like most of the new weapons they have included and I also like Steam Workshop support but that is almost it. There is no reason to play this game because Worms Revolution is much more fun. I think the time they spent creating this should have been used to improve the good concept of Worms Revolution.","November 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","1"

The weapons, controls and other features feels good. However, the art style for the levels and background really annoys me.\n\nWhat really puts me off from playing it, and actually made me buy a 4-pack of Worms Reloaded instead, is the extra layer for the levels that make it really hard to read which has collision and what is pass through. The part you stand on and navigate on has depth, since it's 3d. And that itself can make it slightly hard to judge where a ledge stops. But the real problem is the second layer of the level, which sits directly behind the parts you stand on. That layer also gets destroyed or mostly partly destroyed, creating an even more unreadable level.\n\nWorms Clan Wars has some good things, but my recommendation is to buy Worms Reloaded instead!","October 7, 2014","false","2.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","4"

It's the exact same game as Worms Revolution which was released 10 months earlier, but the new menu screen, weapon selection, interface and narrator are so displeasing to me that I'd rather play the old version. Worms Clan Wars feels like an unintended step backwards.\n\nI am, however, eagerly awaiting Team17's next Worms game. Like clockwork, they've been releasing a solid title, followed by terrible one for decades now.

Unfortunately, Team17 is the dumbest game developer out there and simplified this game to death. There's only one kind of water generator and you can only have two on a map, not to mention they are huge and take up a lot of space. They also remove any terrain around them and can waste water particles filling up the space they inhabit. The rope physics might be technically more realistic, but feel terrible and clumsy compared to the W2 rope. The amount of worm customization is very limited. The level editor is clunky and does not allow for precision land design with it's weird 3D look that makes it hard to tell what is actual land and what is decorative land around the actual land. As I stated, the game is terribly simplified in options of customization. You can't make wooden beams fixed, nor make them indestructible. There are no door objects or other nifty things. The water generators are also succeptible to being blown up and cannot be made indestructible. You can't set things to float on water either. You can't set the bounciness of the terrain, or the gravity, or a dozen other options that they could have easily made available. Why? Because it was designed for consoles and ported to PC/MAC. I really really hate this design mentality. Why limit your game by stupid consoles? I love my PS3 but at least make an enhanced version of the game for PC/MAC. Team17 gets 1 star from me, for being a terrible, narrow-minded company. They could have added lots of game modes like real time combat, which would open the door for even more modes, like soccer, capture the flag, american football, etc. There's also no snow or ice, which is another example of their short sightedness. The snow theme was my favorite in Worms2. Basically, this is a decent game if you need your worms fix, but I'd recommend not buying it and teaching Team17 a lesson.","July 28, 2014","false","124.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The enemy worms kill themselves half the time. Some people were complaining that the AI in Worms Revolution was way too skilled, but I'd prefer that over this idiot AI any time.\n- More annoying (and less funny) narrator, although this probably is a matter of taste.\n- Game-breaking bugs. Some levels can't be completed and you have to do them all over again from the start, possibly even multiple times until you figure out what causes the bug.\n- Crashes.\n- A higher price.\n\nOverall:\nDon't buy this game unless you have already finished Worms Revolution and just want to do some more single player missions (that you might have to redo several times).","February 21","false","14.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

This is probably the most fun you can have in 20 minutes with three friends, assuming you have three friends to play with. If you don't, you can randomly be matched with other people who want to play the game with you. If you don't like playing with other people at all, there's the perfectly fun campaign, voiced-over by the sadistic and sarcastic Ms. Tara Pinkle, archaeologist and adventurer extrordinaire. This is a very fun game, and very relaxed, easily playable once you get used to the slightly flash game-esque controls.","March 4, 2014","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I figured that a 2013 edition of the game would be bigger and better.  Boy was I mistaken.\n\nMy PC is a potato.  I recognize that.  But I can't understand how and why this game runs so poorly, particularly since the "3D" aspects of the game are quite tame.  Input lag.  Poor frame rates.  Terrible optimizations.  Even the cursor moves around on the selection menus with a delay, resulting in misclicks at every turn.  I get that I can't run the latest AAA titles, but thereis no excuse for how terribly this game runs.  This smacks of a terrible console port.\n\nThe new control configuration is also terrible.  I don't really understand what was wrong with the original control setup.  Someone decided to reinvent the wheel, and this new wheel does not roll.\n\nThis, like all other worms games that attempt to go 3D, is an unmitigated disaster.  Worms is best in 2D and IMO it should stay that way.","December 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeah.. The water... Well this feature is to-ta-lly useless...\n\nThe 3D graphics did make sense in worms 3D, but in here there is absolutely no point to use it..\n\nThe bots are completely useless! I don't know how many turn I have waited 45sec to see the AI doing nothing at all!\n\nThe games modes are seen and seen again and again. Nothing really new.\nThey could have create new vs games with this awesome feature (the water) but I think they realized how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was and did nothing with it...\n\nHo, and about the controls on a controller. Even this is totally wrong! The buttons mapping is totally TOTALLY NOT intuitive! I mean, jump with A? A?!! And fire with X? X?!!! That's the best way to mislead everyone!\n\nThe only good point is the story and the voice acting. It seams they spent all their money in it....\n\n\nAnyway, I'm so disappointed with those games, I really miss the previous worms...\nIt a shame cause I really like this franchise, I have so many memories playing with friends.

If you're new to the series, this is the place to start\n\nPros:\n-Best 3d worms game so far\n-It plays and feels like worms armaggeddon\n-It looks very good\n-You can customize your worms, and get funny hats from the workshop\n-MP works fine\n-New mechanics improve the game withour changing it too much. Not all ground can be destroyed, some objects in the landscape can be moved or destroyed, you can throw water that, etc.\n\nCons\n-Ninja rope now feels like an actual rope. Do not expect to cross half the map in 15 secs with it.\n-The repetitive voices\n-It's poorly optimized. If you have 2 graphic cards, you will have to manually configure them to play the game, otherwise it'll be painfully slow and chunky.","February 24, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Anyways worms clan wars i will say there is some things i like about this game more than revolution! The clan feature is kinda cool having ur own clan and have people join it so you can come across another clan and fight them competively! So thats a plus the single player isnt that special so meh The gameplay is pretty much the same as revolution the graphics are pretty goregous just like revolution but i dont think its as good as revolution's graphics. One of the worst things about this game is the framerate, O.M.G THE FRAMERATE IS SO ♥♥♥♥ IN THIS GAME I MEAN ITS OK AT TIMES BUT UGH ITS SO BAD MOST OF THE TIME AND REVOLUTION BARELY HAS A FRAMERATE DROP AND IT LOOKS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS GAME. *sigh* i mean holy ♥♥♥♥ seriously u guys really screwed up the framerate? well nvm but the new weapons are some returning ones (well i think at least probally one) and some new ones like the aqua pack. Which is cool and a bit helpful but meh i think i can still stick with a jetpack. Well anyways this game is meh its good bad eh but i think if u pass some of my personal problems with the framerate and the graphics which might be stupid but play the game for urself and u might like the game more than revolution. I do think this is a stepback from revolution and i'm really sorry for all of you clan wars fans i'm not saying i hate this game i actually like a few things about this game more than revolution like the new weapons and the clan feature but the framerate gets kinda in the way but also the game can be a bit boring and idk why but i hate the ♥♥♥♥ing the narater? (or guider i guess lol) i hate the voice so much more than revolution thats is extremly nit picky i know but still i hate this voice SO MUCH! well this game gets a 7.5 out 10 its good but luckily for u clan wars fans i still recommened this game even through all my hate u might be like wtf? but its still a fun worms game! So its still ok n yeah i recoomened revolution more but this is still good!","February 20, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Before people ask yes I do have a decent gaming rig. Not the top of the line but if I'm able to play: BF4, Borderlands PS, and AC Unity I'm sure it "should" be capable of handling the graphics on this game even if on lowest settings. However after checking obvious things like drivers/updates reinstalling and such I was unable to get this game to run on reliable framerates above 15. I opened a ticket with Team17 and one of their reps did exchange emails with me to troubleshoot the issue (briefly) but in the end i was told:\n\n"Thank you for attempting all of the actions which we have previously recommended.\nAt this point, it sounds as though you might be one of the unfortunate handful who are experiencing a yet unresolved performance issue with particular system configurations.\nPlease know that you information has been raised to the appropriate team and should be reviewed shortly.\nOur apologies for any inconvenience that this issue may be causing you in the meantime."\n\nThis was back in November of 2014....still nothing was done to help address this performance issue.

The worms are very customizable (With Steam Workshop) and if you have friends that have the game, play w/ them, its a really great time. But the only falls I have is lag and the lack of a community. If the game gets more popular, Ill give it a 10/10, and if not, my rating is 9.5/10 as long as I have a friend to play with.

The game is full of the polish force no wonder why we need to wait forever, dont want to be racist but i was not even once able to join a game since i bought this Game. I wonder why so many people enjoy this game. I personaly didnt enjoy any moment in this Game. The offline gameplay is just poorly and online like i said not working. Thank you whoever made this Game... Many People will say now:" then why did you buy it?" or " Why dont you refund?" I thought its a good game with competend people and i dont refund because the money i would get is just not worth my time. Dislike this review or whatever.

Minus a few more points for the ninja rope being soaked in water and no longer magically standing on your weight, to end all the fun you used to have with it.\n\nIt also was entirely incompatible with my computer (that didn't stop me from trying it on another, though).  The screen was black, just with the HUD displaying.\n\nIts new graphics may look good, but it's very hard to tell when the map ends and the background begins, leading to a lot of stupid mistakes usually ending with a worm either falling off a cliff for land damage and a wasted turn, shooting himself with a rocket, or just drowning in the water at the bottom of the map.\n\nJust buy Worms: Reloaded and/or Ultimate Mayhem if you're looking for a good Worms game.  This one might be a little fun, but if you're a big Worms fan, you're probably going to be disappointed with this.","April 27, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

"Water" it doesn't ripple when you shoot it sorta speak. But the brute force of an explotion will send what ever water there is on the map flying, Careful...

A great multiplayer game and even great fun to just mess around with alone. My only qualm that I feel needs mentioning is the lack of customisable play styles. I put a great many hours into Worms 2: Armageddon on the xbox and loved the feature that I could immediately start overtime, or limit the weapons or cut turn time down to a few seconds. It always made things interesting. Clan Wars should have done that and more. Supposedly, they stopped because they didnt want the interface to get to messy, but it would be a good "advanced" panel that really spices up the game. I only wish that someone could fix this on the Workshop.\n\nThe game is still great and you should buy it, but keep in mind that it is not the most customisable worms game out there.","April 15, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Expanding on Revolution's physics-based combat, especially dynamic water, this is a game that requires a change in strategy from say, Worms Reloaded. For example, in Worms Clan Wars, when a grenade is thrown anywhere that is not completely flat land, it rolls. Typically in an older Worms title, grenades would not be nearly as affected by gravity. This makes combat either much easier, or much harder, depending on how you are at the game. Either way, it requires a bit of getting used to.\n\nClan Wars' strength lies in its customization. While Mac users are out of luck currently regarding the Steam Workshop, everyone has open access to the in-game level editor, which is excellent and very easy to use thanks to a selection of brush and line tools which make precise editing simple.\n\nUnfortunately this is a game, and an entire series that shines with its multiplayer; but the community is lacking, as of now. So, unless you have friends to play with, you may want to get Armageddon instead.\n\nIf that's not an issue, by all means buy this.

After all, it is basically the same game as previous installments, so you would think they would have got it right by now... unfortuntaly, not quite.\nBut first, I quite liked the idea of different worm varieties. there are worms that heal themselves and worms around them on their turn, worms that jump and move faster and worms that explode harder when they... die? and they have reduced movement speed, jumping ability and has less jetpack fuel? sure, okay.\nIt allows for some neat gameplay strategies and adds a well needed extra layer of tactics to worm matches. the physics water is also a neat feature, if not vastly overpowered, especially when using water based weaponry that can make worms slip and drown in the actual 'water' water.\nWhile it's not a bad game, it has many little issues that really hold the game back. The weapons are a little unbalanced and inconsistant. I have never been able to accurately tell how much damage a weapon is going to do: a bazooka hit directly may do 30 damage, or 50. I have never been able to find out why it does this, but it is very infuriating because it puts an extra layer of doubt when planning attacks because you don't know what the move will accomplish: it may destroy a worm or simply critically wound it.\nThe UI is also an issue. for starters, the aiming reticule is much too big and inaccurate: I would have much preferred a simple dotted line and a small crosshair rather than the over-produced whacky one it has. playing multiplayer has some strange quirks with matchmaking too: you can't start a new game with a player in the same session, you have to back out of a session entirely and start a new one. It is uncesscesarily finicky and awkward.\nThe singleplayer is also dissapointing. I find it funny that they expect you to go through tutorial stages. I mean it's only been 18 freaking games, I think I got the gist of it by now! I would have liked the option to skip those levels. The narrator (definatly NOT a laura croft spoof) is also a tad annoying, but that is subjective, you may enjoy it. needless to say I do not. otherwise, the singleplayer campaign is just a string of battles with objectives thrown in, usual fair. nothing special at all.\nOverall it's a very mediocure entry to the series that feels very unpolished and undercooked. For what it's worth though, despite it's problems, I had fun playing it with mates. If you are willing to overlook it's flaws, it's still at it's core a worms game. But even saying that, there have better worms games before this. Just get Worms: Armageddon Instead.","April 21, 2015","false","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Scientists for example heal nearby friendly worms, scouts can move faster and don't set off mines, soldiers make a huge explosion when they die, etc. This adds a bit more strategy.\n\nCons:\nOnline multiplayer is deserted. I could not find a clan or a ranked online match with people. You will most likely need to play this with IRL friends.

Expanding on Revolution's physics-based combat, especially dynamic water, this is a game that requires a change in strategy from say, Worms Reloaded. For example, in Worms Clan Wars, when a grenade is thrown anywhere that is not completely flat land, it rolls. Typically in an older Worms title, grenades would not be nearly as affected by gravity. This makes combat either much easier, or much harder, depending on how you are at the game. Either way, it requires a bit of getting used to.\n\nClan Wars' strength lies in its customization. While Mac users are out of luck currently regarding the Steam Workshop, everyone has open access to the in-game level editor, which is excellent and very easy to use thanks to a selection of brush and line tools which make precise editing simple.\n\nUnfortunately this is a game, and an entire series that shines with its multiplayer; but the community is lacking, as of now. So, unless you have friends to play with, you may want to get Armageddon instead.\n\nIf that's not an issue, by all means buy this.

Over the week that I've had it I've already racked up 14 hours on this game and counting. I'd really recommend it if you're a casual player or you just want to mess around with friends. It's not amazingly optimised truth be told but it makes up for it with a Campaign that teaches you about all those weapons you never really knew what the hell they did.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say go for it.","January 5","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First time I was introduced to Worms was on my PS1 on a demo disc, where I could play it. It wasted hours just playing against the bots. It wasn't actually until in High School, where my friend and was looking for the game to play.\n\nAnd this popped up I thought it would be cool. The game has beautiful graphics, great variety of guns and a surprisingly fun single player! It has multiplayer too (obviously) and it seems to me, there's a lot of activity.\n\nI think the main part of why this game is during to well it's because of the Steam Community where people mod various things into the game, which is completely free by the way. Games which supports mods, skins is always a plus for me. Worms Clan Wars is just an overall great game and who don't like Worms?","October 28, 2015","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Multiplayer is as fun as ever with all the customization you now have with matchmaking.  There are quite a bit of gamemodes and some 'mini' gamemodes too.  I love the artstyle of Worms Clan Wars and the music is pretty soothing as well.
