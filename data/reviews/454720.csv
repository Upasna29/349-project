"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/recommended/454720/","fantis6","fantis6","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/","2599 products in account","RAM BOE is a nice and relaxing puzzle game what inspired by classic Sokoban.\n\nWhen you start this game you will find here a little story too, the purport of this: you are a adventurer who sadly have been trapped by a dameon. But later you are escaped and your soul moved to one ram. Now your quest is to release every soul what you will find in your journey and escape from rune stones.\nHere you will find 40 different levels, first levels been a tutorial levels, where you will learn a basics of game. Your goal is to convine the same runes and when you have only one from that type, you should deliver that to the specific point of current level. When you doed this with all runes, you should move also to that point, after this you will finish a current level. Also you will find for example on some levels a "random" rune stone spawn, what bring to the game more variability. The levels are not so hard, you can pass them enough fast if your goal just pass a game and not a beat even bigger score.\nIn a game you will find a nice graphic also a relaxing music what well fit to the game.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+ steam cards and achievements\n+ nice graphic\n+ nice music\n+ relaxing gameplay\n+ have a little story\n+ "random" on some levels\n+ leaderboard\n\n- sometimes easy do to much step\n- short\n- will be fine if game get some harder levels\n- camera view\n\nIf you are looking for a gem with "Dark Souls" experience, this game not for you. Here you will not find a to hard puzzles, you can pass them enough fast, so will be great if in future a game get some harder levels too. However this game is enough good, if you are want to get some relaxing hours with nice graphic and music, this game for you, especially a price is fair for this.","April 15","true","3.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It's quite cool and catchy. It reminds me about a very old game played on my first computer, a 486, on windows 3.1 - Chips. A game from Wingames bundle. This time, well we have 3D, nice music and graphics and ingenious level designs.\n\nAwesome!\n\nI do recommend it.\n\nNotes:\n1) Pay attention to the Tip screens - you may find out useful tips.\n2) The game may require some updates. I had to use my Enter key from the numeric keypad, instead of the "Return" one.\n\nQuestion for develpers: can you please decrease the animation time on PC? The animation takes too long.. Sometimes I have the feeling that the animations are slowing me down and I feel like I loose precious seconds... Thank you!\n\n","April 4","true","1.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I would have preferred a much simpler version that didn't require me to wait ages for the ram to move around.  I think 90% of my time was spent just waiting for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to move!","April 5","false","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

If you like casual puzzle games, this is a nice way to pass the time. The music and graphics are well done, and Ram Boe himself is super cute! It has a sweet retro feel to it too; classic gameplay at heart.\n\nJust watch the cliffs, I walked off so many times already!!
