I let the AI play for the first quarter (USA {me} vs. Venezuela), I took over, and I won by 5 points. 11/10 most stressful basketball memory ever.\n\nI received a review copy of this game and was excited to try it because I love in-depth sports management games. I was surprised and a bit overwhelmed by how extensive and deep Pro Basketball Manager 2016 turned out to be, but was also still very pleased with my gameplay experience. My best friend (basketball buff) helped me understand many of the mechanics, and we played through a very stressful game against Venezuela and nearly lost (with our USA dream team, mind you).\n\nIf you like intricate sports (specifically basketball) management, then you must give this title a try. Be advised, there is a horde of content within, and it can be easy to get lost in it if you are not patient.\n\nThe aesthetics are good – even though much of the game is text- and data-based (many graphs), the layout is very clean and easy to navigate through (and trust me, there are many screens you’ll be looking at). During games, you can watch in 2D or 3D mode – 2D offering a more tactical look and 3D giving you a nice change from the heavy text. I was impressed with the variety of great music in the game’s library – I actually thought it was my own music playing. There is a mixture of chill tracks and more upbeat, exciting ones too. You will be forging your own legacy (hopefully), so the game is very open to differing playthroughs. When you start, you may pick any available team in the world, and can pick up a second one as well (although the artificial intelligence (AI) will coach your secondary team for you if you wish to focus on your main – I strongly suggest that you concentrate on one team at a time).\n\nYou’ll be using the mouse to navigate through the game, so the controls are simple, however, the amount of different elements to understand and consider are enormous. There are tooltips always available, and the game can be quite overwhelming if you have no experience with management games – especially sports-based ones. You can have your assistant coaches select things for you if you ever need help – for example, starting line-ups, positioning, allocated play time, et cetera. The learning curve is moderate to extreme depending on your experience with management games, and the most difficult element is probably balancing all your responsibilities. The AI will play decently if you choose to simulate games, but if you want the best (and most stressful) experience, then you will want to play every game – or at least every critical game for your team(s).\n\nGameplay consists of you managing every possible aspect of your team(s) – you begin by creating avatar then move on to selecting a team in the world to represent. My best friend and I found it nice (and hilarious) that the player roster is very close to real-life (ex: Kobe “Bryent” and LeBron “Jamas”). Even head coaches had similar names to their real-life counterparts. I selected Los Angeles and assembled my national (USA) dream team, also picking up a Brazilian secondary amateur team. Next, you will be planning player budget and scouting – in order to do things like recruit and rehabilitate, you will need to invest in better staff (sports therapists, trainers, etc). You can even select how much seat tickets in your local arena will cost, as well as concession and memorabilia prices.\n\nTraining is very in-depth and you will be selecting how much time in a day (as well as before and day-of matches) to spend on team/individual practice. Furthermore, you can personalize training for each player, having one individual focus on 3-pointers and another focus on defensive play. Your training regime will directly impact your performance during games, and you will probably find yourself switching up your strategy often – until you become more comfortable with the gameplay.\n\nDuring game days, you can simulate your own, but I recommend you play through an entire session at least once for the full experience. There is text-only play-by-play commentary, and you can offer general strategies in-match. If you want to go deeper, you can even manipulate defensive/offensive strategies live – and doing this will give you the best performance. That being said, my best friend and I nearly lost against Venezuela because we simply watched the AI for the first quarter. If you want to play zone man-to-man, you can do so; if you want to suddenly isolate while on offence, that’s an option too. Double-teaming your highest-scoring opponent may work, and you can expect the AI to do the same to you. You’ll also have to be aware of substitutions, as your players’ morale and fatigue will fluctuate. During intermissions, you can give motivational feedback to your team, and their morale will be affected depending on your choice (ex: “we are only losing by a few points,” when it’s the last quarter and your team has been working hard may have mixed reception on individual morale). If you choose to play at least some of your games, you will be able to play Pro Basketball Manager 2016 for the rest of your life (or at least until the next installment comes out). Trust me, nothing beats live coaching, and your stress levels will reach a new high.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing in terms of depth, albeit a bit overwhelming at times. If you enjoy the intricacy of managing and coaching your own basketball team, then you must definitely give this title a try.\n\nI recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","January 14","true","3.5"," 58 of 81 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","58","81","3","8"

So here I am 14 hours later after playing non stop and I must say, I actually like it. Now I'm not going to say it's game of the year worthy and the names really bother me (Korean names being American names) but if you can get pass that and a few buggy features here and there this game is rather enjoyable.\n\nI seen a lot saying the game crashes all the time but I have not had it crash once on me.\n\nDo I think the game is worth 19.99 ??? No. I think it needs a lot more work to be worth that. However I'm not taking away the fact that this is an awesome game. I've been playing and it takes some time to get used to everything but I really feel that if the developers stick to updating the game and listening to feedback this game will be even better and soon worth the $20 they ask for it.\n\n8.5/10 is would I give this game and I shall be playing this game a hell of a lot more because it is really fun and addicting.\n\nNOTE: This game is more in an early access point as I'm writing this so if you aren't into a fully polished, worth maybe 10 buck game then I wouldn't get it just yet.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential and I'll be sticking with it every step of the way. I do recommend only if you want to play a game that's slightly buggy and needs more tuning.","January 19","true","20.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

But this is a huge step in right direction.  It is not the most stable game and has a habit of crashing.  And is not perfect, would like more options to set overall team strategies, instruct players to avoid fouls (ai seems to adjust this even when you're coaching), no way to guage interest in trades or put players on the block, and player tactics does not allow you to save them.\nBut it is clear that the team behind this a serious about making this a good product and even if it is a few years down the track I will continue to support because it is the only good basketball management game out and year on year it gets better.","January 14","true","4.0"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

I really do. So much that I ignored the "mixed" reviews. I love sports management simulations and would love to have a good basketball one.\n\nThis one isn't it, sadly. It seems rushed and half done, more like an early access title. It is:\n\n- crashes constantly (~ 1 crash per hour for me, hope you saved!)\n- absolutely lacking documentation, the "manual" is a joke, couldn't even find what skills influence exactly what\n- riddled with bugs (for example you can hire the same scout twice, he will show up twice, salary deducted twice, but he can only ever be on one mission)\n- lots of unpolishedness that with tiem drives you crazy (select sorting, go to player page, go back, sorting gone :( )\n- missing features (or things I can't find in the game or the manual) - hey you are scouting this player, oh you realized after an update he is not for you - there is NO WAY (that I can find) to abort scouting that player so hey continue wasting resources on them\n- Game gets ridicoulosly slow at times, e.g. if I played a game, simulated till end and afterwards want to simulate the schedule. At one time it just stopped after minutes. An no I haven't selected too many leagues, restart and reload the game and everything happens in seconds again (some sort of leak I guess)\n\nThat are just a few of the things. You can also find a "<BR>" text in a fairly prominent text (HTML for line break, seems to have not been correctly converted). This hints to the amount of quality assurance this apparently went through.\n\nStay away.","January 19","false","10.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/druidblue/recommended/347060/","druidblue","Druidblue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/druidblue/","464 products in account","Entertaining and deep simulation with a few quirks in a short time playing. Biggest issue so far is adjusting to odd English translations for game actions. "The referees take (player x)" is a common penalty call, for instance. Other than that localization issue, the gameplay is clearly deep, with both pro and college teams, male and female, and the ability to manage do what degree you choose. There's the ability to design your own plays, run specific ones, or just say "Hey, PG, shoot a 3 this time." However, just like coaches have to deal with, the players won't always react how you want. There's morale, injuries, and all of the typical details you'd expect in such a sim.\n\nOnly a bit into it so far (with one come-from-behind 16 point turn around by Michigan State over Kansas), but it's there's quite a bit here to get into. Time will tell how it stands up.\n\nNow, I present to you the end of my review and the beginning of my personal musical's hit number, "Bork!"\n\n*curtain rises*\nBork! Mmmm bork bork bork!

I skipped the 2015 edition of this game and hoped that 2016 would be a better game. So far, this game has not met my expecations.\n\nThe game is clunky, UI is messy, and the 3D engine is quite disastrous. Everything runs a couple seconds late, the animations are bad at best, and the game does not come with the right tools for you to make on the fly decisions as a "basketball manager."\n\nThat isn't to say this game does not have potential. The foundation has been laid for what could be a great game, but the devs will need to expand upon it to optimze the game performance and reduce the crashes. If they can do that, I would have happy to change my review to a recommend, but at this point, I simply cannot recommend this to anyone, even if you are a fan of simulation series/basketball.","January 15","false","1.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","13","21","3","0"

No? Yeah, me neither.\n\nWell, good news! It's back - with a slight rearrangement of the words in the title, anyway - and this time, it's got shooting fouls!\n\nPros:\n1) English translation of French terms will keep you on your toes, regardless of your basketball knowledge. Your starting PG just got the master key? Hey, good for him.\n2) You will become intimately familiar with the various menus and submenus as you try and track down the location of fundamental components like statistical leaders and free agents.\n3) Worried that your team is lacking firepower on the perimeter? Never mind, that 6/20 rated three point shooting SF has got you covered - 60% on the year on just under 1 attempt a game.\n4) Worried that those teeny little guards aren't going to help out on the glass? Don't be! With the rigidly scripted 3Dish engine, your guards have as much chance of being in a rebounding position as I do of firing this title up again.\n5) Did I mention shooting fouls?!\n\nCons:\n1) My lack of familiarity with professional basketball coaching probably had something to do with my 4/20 rated 3pt shooting starting forward firing up 5.5 3pt attempts per game  on a .008 clip for the year.\n2) My lack of familiarity with Vietnamese culture probably had something to do with me not finding it authentic having Vietnamese prospects with American names.\n\nHighly recommended!","January 18","false","8.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","4","7","5","0"

Simple as that, as there is no other game out there that comes that close to Football Manager.\nMy only BIG issue with this game is that the 2D presentation is toooo small!!!\nIt wouldn't hurt nor would it be that difficult to make it double the size! My eyes hurt, seriously!\n\nNo, I wont watch the games in 3D because it is crap and I enjoy a simulated game better in a 2D view mode!","May 11","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
