As soon as you start, you are given a little tutorial which you don't see often in indie, adventure games. You go to help out a village in trouble from bandits, trolls and zombies. The first battle you encounter is so easy, its a tutorial of its own. You and your soldiers battle a couple of easy enemies. You get the hang of the combat system before entering any major battles.You can recruit more soldiers at the tavern inside the town. I hired a few adventurers for my adventure . I am not sure what happens if you save the village, but I know you can construct buildings within the colony, like a blacksmith and upgrade the market. Now this is still early development, but I can already see a lot of potential in it. Because I do not like turn-based combat games, but I like this game.\n\nBecause this is early development, I am not expecting the things I hate to stay in the game. Since the last news update was 20th of December (today it is 21st December), I assume the game is not forgotten about. Which just makes me more excited for whats to come. I want to see the finished product because already a few minutes in and I am pumped about getting into my next battle and recruiting a lot of soldiers to save the village people! If you are a Mount And Blade fan and don't mind if the combat slows down a little, then this game is for you.\n\nPro\n- Combat system beautifully well done\n- Recruitment system like Mount And Blade\n- Leveling system\n- Tutorial\n- Tiny download (Australians understand)\n- Visuals well done\n- Enemy models look good\n\nCon\n- Map is really confusing\n- The mine enemies are OP, guess I am not meant to attack that first.\n- Combat is sometimes slow\n- Font hurts my eyes\n- Dialogue is a bit all over the place","December 20, 2015","true","0.8"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","48","55","4","0"

For someone who wants a AAA rpg or a generic wrapped up dungeon crawler, look elsewhere. Blood of Magic is the definition of homebrew, but that is not a bad thing. The developers are kind and keep in touch, and every aspect of this game, flawed or fabulous, is unique. I reccomend this game to those who enjoy some good turn based combat, or even town building, as raising up a small woodland town to a big fortress is a very satisfiying feeling. Watching this game grow is going to be awesome, and I'll be in Auguston (main town) for all of it.","January 22","true","19.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","1"

I reviewed this game around .51, so take it as you will.\n\nBlood of Magic is an interesting look into the sandbox genre as it tries to combine different elements of other sandbox games. The most interesting to me is the fact that the player can develop a party on their own and build a town. It kind of reminds me of Mount and Blade in that aspect. Although, this is more fantasy than straight medieval.\n\nFirst of all, the combat is extremely simplistic and kind of outdated in this day and age. That doesn't mean it's bad. It's a simple turn-based combat system, so for people who love that kind of stuff will fit right in here.\n\nThere's plenty of exploration in the game as well. Half of the fun of these sandbox games is exploring what's out there. Currently, the world is small compared to other games (especially AAA games) but that's expected from a small game studio.\n\nPlaying through this game, there are bugs here and there. And that's to be expected until the game is finished. The great thing that I noticed is that the Dev is responsive and making sure that the bugs are squashed. They seem dedicated to making a game that's both fun and enjoyable.\n\nSo, if you're into these type of games, I wholly recommend it. Keep in mind that's currently in Early Access.","January 7","true","1.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

The game includes all necessary aspects of the genre, including quests, dialogues, levelling-up, economics and loot system. Squad could be created considering needs of the player. You can pick whoever you want, set them the way you like depending on your personal preferences. The longer you play, the more you’re involved. Your own interest is growing minute after minute, so what’s waiting ahead?\nSo, let’s get closer to these aspects.\nControls. Controls are quite simple and easy-to-use; I guess, even the person with no RPG experience will figure out how to play. In combat mode, everything is quite understandable as well. We have separate tabs for usable items (skills) and for actions of each separate party member.\n\nGameplay. There are too many positive aspects here that literally makes this game unique. The main thing is game’s battle system. You are able to set your party members as you like, learn necessary skills and increase level of characters’ abilities as needed. You can’t just use “Attack” to win a battle and complete a game here, because in this case you’ll suffer incredible losses and your party will get much weaker instead. You have to predict interactions of all players, consider the power and equipment of the players.\nAs I mentioned before, crafting system is quite smart. You’re gathering resources all around the map, completing quests or getting them out of battles with monsters instead. Actually, It’s up to you, but keep in mind – there is no way to fight with no armor. Moreover, the dialogues in the game are pretty interesting. Some might think they’re quite boring, however, this in a RPG, so your reputation depends on them. I mean, majority of your answers might affect your reputation, relations and possible rewards etc. By the way, I was greatly impressed by the recruitment system; there are numerous classes and variety of your party’s positioning options here.\n\nGraphics. Graphics looks nice, eyes dont get tired after a few-hour session , models looks great and realistic. Yes, you can find some bugs or mistakes with textures, but dont forget the product is in the early access, this is alpha version only. I am sure the final result will be excellent.\n\nMusic. Music in the game is beautiful, quiet and unobtrusive. All sound effects are quality and successfully complies with actions.I guarantee you, you will not regret the purchase of this product. The developers constantly improve the game and make us happy with innovations every day.\n\nGood luck!!!","April 16","true","8.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The parts that are in and working are just what I'm looking for from a game.

The world you will discover in Blood of Magic is full of mysteries and wonders.  You will enter this world as the hero, an Arcanist.  The Arcanist is a fighting spellcaster, using both sword and magic to deal with his enemies.  There are quests to be completed to help the town you will oversee.  You decide your character and your party members progression.  You have the abiltity to build new buildings, upgrade them,  hire new unique party members, gather resources, craft new items and more.  You take control of your party members in turn based combat against challenging enemies.  You decide who you want in your party based on their abilities and the situation.  With the gear you craft and aquire, you can outfit your character and party members.  There are unique and power items awaiting your discovery.  Powerful bosses threaten the peace of your town, will rise to the challenge?\n\nThe quick responses from the developers at Stoneworks Games have earned my trust in an early access.

For example:\n\na, Obviously the wide array of abilities and attacks that you can use on your enemies\nb, Focussing on one enemy at a time, while using those special abilities, creates a wonderful combo-attack feeling.\n\n6, Money in the game is a bit hard to come by, it's far too easy to spend all the cash in the beginning and it's not quite clear how you could make more, besides slaying enemies.\n7, On the long run the areas to discover are way to few, but obviously this will be dealt with in the coming months as the game expands\n8, None of the armour is bound to a single class, which I find a good thing, you can just buy armour upgrades and use it for whatever means you want to\n9, Everything together looks like a fun and exciting game, though it obviously needs some finishing touches and more areas to explore, the potential of this game is very big, and it could become a very popular game, though with a niche crowd, mind you.\n\nverdict: Yes, this game is recommendable","January 2","true","1.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I don't have the best graphics card or CPU (AMD FX 8320 and AMD Radeon HD 7790) and it was running the game at 1440p with 60FPS+\n\nAt the time of writing this review I have not been through enough of the storyline to judge it but it is there. I'm sure you get what you pay for with a £7 early access game. Keep that in mind when playing and while reading my review.\n\nThe combat is turn-based which might not be for everyone but there will be some people who love turn-based games. This game adds unique options to combat like taking hits for your team.

I found that the characters didn't quite fit in with the surroundings but while I say that I'm sure they will improve throughout development. The free roam landscape and the buildings in it work well together.\n\nFinal note, I hope to see the idle animations of characters improved so that they're slightly more natural and I'd like to be able to walk up stairs straight instead of needing to strafe.\n\nGood luck with the future developments of this game.","April 16","true","1.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You need to expect the occasional glitch or the possible screen freeze.  Especially with a game this new.  What I pay attention to is the foundation.  Everything else can be altered and improved.  That being said, I'm really enjoying this game so far.  I like that it's turn based and I get to control more then one class.  It gives me time to be a bit more methodical instead of button mashing or pressing the same combo over and over again.  And the quests within the missions really boost the development of the classes.  I love the town management, even though I haven't gotten that far with it yet.  There is just something awesome about having control over your own city and building it up from near nothing.  I do recommend saving often,  I was crushed when my Crossbow wielder died.  He's both annoying and amazing at the same time.  I'm assuming I can recruit another one when I build the barracks but I don't think I can stand to be without him for that long so I restarted from my last save point.  My only other problem is, I do wish the font was a bit easier on the eyes.  It fits with the feel of the game but it can be headache inducing.  Other then that, I highly recommend this game.","January 5","true","3.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

How I perceived this game whether it’s positively or negatively is entirely up to me.\n\nFirst of all, this game is still in the alpha stage of Early Access so expect a whole lot of bugs and errors. Since it’s in Alpha state don’t expect too much on its gameplay and UI (well not yet).\n\nPROS:\n\nGameplay: Town progression is well developed because you can upgrade the village and it’s very well done. You can build blacksmith, windmills, barracks and etc. upgrade the market depending on which play style you want.\n\nCombat is very far from being perfect but it’s in current state it’s very fun and challenging at the same time. Once you encounter an enemy, the game will turn into a turn-based combat which your 6-man party will battle against wide-array of enemies. Although the combat is simple right now and it’s really solid on technicalities.\n\nGraphics: The Assets are impressive in spite of its state. It gives the feel of late 90s RPG games with improvements on visuals.\n\nCONS:\n\nUI: Now this is where the game gets tricky: The dialogue texts are everywhere; The font in the game is really bad; The game uses Right-click to cancel an action instead of Escape; UI is really clunky and near unusable but the developers seem responsive to the feedback and I appreciate that. Overall the UI needs more work to be functional.\n\nOverall I am personally looking forward on the development of this game. It has lots of potentials if you make it work by improving the current combat system, and fixing the appalling UI. And if it’s successfully fixed and developed, surely, it would belong in the category of good games in 2016. The Developers are updating the game almost every week which is great in comparison of some early access games, I’ll rate this game 8/10 on its current state.\n","January 24","true","5.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

They are listening to everything you would like to see in the game or to the error reports and they deliver patches very fast. It is a big plus for every Early-Access, when you can see that the people around a game are into their product und try to make it the best experience you can get.\nTo the game itself, it brings a lot of features and nice detail. You have a huge crafting section in the game, you have to build and upgrade your town to get better crafting recipes and you can hire different companions. Within the companion feature, where you can hire some strangers or militarize civilians and upgrade them to fight alongside yourself in the battlefield.\nThe fighting is round-based, you have to watch for you tactic. It’s a chess-like experience, where you have to anticipate the enemy moves. You fight against a lot of different enemies like archers, wizards and a lot of other medieval NPCs as you know from this genre.\nI’m looking forward, to the new features they will add while they are in Early-Access and for me its totally worth to play it!\n","April 15","true","2.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Especially when you can still run around with a fairly small group of heroes and fight enemies.\nSince this is early alpha, there are off course still problems. I had some trouble finding my way and ended up at a place with high level enemies more than once (though I’ve heard they’re working on this). I also don’t mind turn-based combat but it’s still quite slow and needs some tweaking. I don’t know if I’m just awful at this game but the ogres were kicking my ♥♥♥. Being able to upgrade and change your team sounds promising though.\nThe controls were intuitive though so it was quite fun to walk around and interact with stuff, even if I couldn’t do much yet.\nIn short I’m looking forward to how this game is going to grow. The problems right now might scare a lot of people off.

No one associated with this game has compelled me to leave positive feedback. Observations and comments, whether positive or negative, are entirely my own. If you would like me to review a game, check out: fiverr dot com slash ThatAwesomeTerr.\n\nFirst off, this game is an alpha in Early Access. Every single negative review up to the date that this review was made seems to gloss over that fact, and treats Blood of Magic as if it were complete (or even in beta). So with that being said, if you aren't prepared to play an alpha build of a game in Early Access, don't buy it. But if you're like me and have a lot of experience with testing free and financially supporting paid alphas, then read on!\n\nGiven that it's an alpha, there isn't much to the game as it stands so far. The graphics and animations aren't anything to write home about. At least, not yet.\n\nThe user interface has an appearance that's beyond dated, but it's completely functional. The button setup can be a little weird, but oddly intuitive-- like using RMB instead of ESC to back out of or exit menus. If I have any suggestions for the devs about the UI, it's that it needs to give more feedback to users (tooltips, descriptions, etc).\n\nCombat is basic, but mechanically solid. Being turn-based, anyone who's familiar with the combat systems of classic RPGs (such as Final Fantasy) should pick up on it fairly quickly. To touch on a couple of shortcomings of the UI once again, there is no visual feedback for targeting. Some kind of halo, glow, or highlight around enemies that are targets and allies that are selected would be helpful.\n\nCharacter classes could all use some differentiation. The Scout kind of feels like the Crossbowman and vice versa. I had a hard time telling the strategic and tactical differences between the Arcanist, Militia, and Mercenary at all.\n\nThis is an alpha, and as of this review the alpha build is at version 0.51. This means that there are going to be bugs and plenty of them. A large portion of the bugs I ran into were just glitchy animations where characters would kind of spazz out during combat. These were typically solved by waiting for several seconds.\n\nI only ran into a game-breaking bug once. It was also during combat. Though the game didn't freeze (environment and passive animations kept playing), one of my party members wouldn't turn the right way around after running back from striking an enemy. No combat options were given.I couldn't break combat or even bring up the menu with TAB.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game to JUST anybody. Not because it's bad, but rather because it's an alpha that you would have to pay for. Anyone who puts down $11 on this title needs to understand that, and as such, it is very possible that the game may never fully be realized.\n\nOn the other hand, I would be lying if I said Blood of Magic wasn't worth supporting. The negative reviews this game has received are unwarranted. Just go read them; they treating an Early Access alpha as if they'd bought a full-release of a completed game.\n\nAs this review states, for an alpha build, the mechanics are solid. Add to that that the devs are very active and communicate with their playerbase, and the the foundation for what could be a really good game is there.\n\nAt the end of the day, it breaks down to this: if you're the type who likes to support independent devs and studios, then you should really consider supporting this game. It's only $11, after all. But if you aren't someone who is interested in contributing to a game that is in its earliest stages of development, then skip it.","January 5","true","3.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

This review is done in the early access stage of the game, so there will be bugs and glitches that I know will be addressed and fixed by the time the game gets released.  I have played over 10 hours of the game and must say that the game is really fun. It has great graphics, sounds, combat, and various combat attacks.  If you like games like Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft, this game is a must try for you.  I highly recommend this and can't wait to see what this game looks like once it is released!","January 9","true","10.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I was not expecting an early access game to be this good. It's very playable, have not seen any game breaking bugs so far. This game reminds me of some sort of mix between morrowind, heroes of might and magic and darkest dungion. It has some very interesting concepts. It's well worth the money the way it is right now but by the looks of it, it is going to be way better once finished.

It's certainly not as polished as these games but in return there seems to be sooo many more options to go for which for me personally is a great trade-off. There seem to be lot's of different classes and places to go, aswell as there's a town you have to defend and manage. The side quests seem to be a bit too numerous but it luckily doesn't seem like you have to do all of them.\n\nI wish the tutorial was a bit more fast paced though as it took me about an hour to completely figure out what I was doing, a bit like with minecraft. Wouldn't stop me personally but that might annoy some people. Other than that I would like to see this game continue and am really hoping I get to see this game further developed! :) There's a lot of features and they all seem like they're being worked on so that gives a lot of hope.","May 9","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although glitchy it is still playable and a very enjoyable game, once completed I see this game being very succesful. The controls are pretty straight forward and took me only a few seconds to figure out. The developers are very approachable and any bug that is reported to them is fixed extremely quickly, this speaks volumes to me and shows that the developers actually care about what they are producing and that they listen to their customers unlike the bigger publishers. Whilst playing I came across quite a lot of graphical glitches, nothing major but is worth bearing in mind before purchasing. Personally I would reccomend getting this game even in its current state. If you have played the original fable game then I think you would like this game, it has a similar kind of feel to it.\n\nTL;DR : Great game overall, I reccomend you buy a copy , be aware there are some glitches as this is a beta game.","January 23","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I think I technically won a battle, but everyone in my party but me died and I died on the next battle obviously.  I think? I purchased new equipment in town before going out.  I have some quests from town, but I can't win a battle, so I am not having any luck completing a quest.  Game sounds like a good idea and it may get there, but so far, not much luck enjoying the game.\n\nAlso, I've saved my game twice now on two different restarts and neither game will load.  The first one just loaded a grey screen.  The second save loaded a partial view of a town with grey all around it.  I appeared partially buried in the ground.  I was unable to even move on either save game.

I literally found almost no pro. If you are interested in this game, you should definitely wait until it's out of EA, maybe you can enjoy it then.
