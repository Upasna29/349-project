That's about it, I played it with Keyboard & Mouse, it was 4 minutes long, to perfect on first run. The gameplay mechanic is very simple, you're riding a roller coaster and you have to aim (with your head if you have an Oculus Rift or with your Mouse if you don't) red targets that appear around you, as you advance.\n\nNot bad for a demo, it's free and also, less than 250MB, so I think it’s an interesting experience.\n\n★★★☆☆ | It was OK","January 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","45","51","6","0"

It is a short game which rewards you at the end based on how many neurons you got.\n\nTry it. It isn't long, but offers insight in how VR-games could work.

The basic tenet of Inmind is to delve into the neuro pathways of the mind ( the target subject has a psycological disorder,) and to "fix" the "damaged" connections. Basically, you shoot the nasties as you progress down the pathway.\n\nThe dev's have released this short game, free of charge - I guess to glean feedback so that when the game is released, they have a pretty good idea of it's uptake and what the community thinks. So I was happy to fill in the short questionnaire at completion of the game.\n\nThe visual presentation of Inmind is quite stunning, and a good representation of what I imagine the mind's pathways look like. It is meant to be played with an OR, but you can also play on a PC with a mouse (which is what I did).\n\nThe sounds, suited the scene and were easy on the ear.\n\nMy only gripe is that I wanted to keep playing, but Inmind has released only one level which can be completed in under 10 minutes.\n\nDuring that time, the graphics were smooth and not at all taxing on my system and overall performance was excellent. Not crashes or bugs were encountered.\n\nWonder what trying to fix the mind of an axe murderer would look like, probably be a difficulty level of  "Extreme" and would need bots to assist - only guessing mind you :P\n\nGive Inmind a try - it wont cost you a cent, nada, nothing, 没什么, nietsrien, τίποτα, Tidak Ada, 何も, Tiada apa-apa, שום דבר, Kahore, لا شيء, nic, Ничего, hiçbir şey, free.\n\nShort Game Score: 8.75/10","January 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Problem?)\n\nThere is one major thing I hate about InMind VR, however. It's really an on-rails game (the type of which I despise) and doesn't give you much freedom in terms of movement or anything else really. You just launch the game and it throws you straight into the brain to fix a Human's neurons.\n\nHOWEVER, despite that major shortcoming, InMind VR has stunning visuals of the insides of a Human brain and shows us, those who aren't doctors, how the Human brain looks like from a really tiny level. Even with a severe limitation, it just lets you truly feel that you're inside the brain and see each thought process, each signal being sent or received by neurons.\n\nPerfect for when you're high too.","January 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","11","18","8","10"

For the first time since getting the DK2, I had a sense of empowerment (read: Unfair advantage. License to pwn!) which I have never experienced before. I didn't think that gyrating my big melon around could be an advantage, but it really does bring something to the table as far as VR is concerned. Yay, neck muscles!\n\nEntirely too short for how much fun it is.  I'm ready to pay for more! Right now, it's like an amusement park attraction--short burst of a high-quality sensation.  It reminds me of Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin or similar shooting-gallery ride, though it's much less difficult (Cracked 50/50 on the first try!) and way more gratifying than those sorts of rides for the short time you are in there. Plus, no need for a Fast Pass!\n\nDon't underestimate the headphones either.

I beat the game in about four minutes. As far as gameplay goes, it was extremely basic (I played it on my laptop rather than a VR console). Movement is done for you, taking you along a pre-designated track (very much like a Disney ride) through a human brain. Move the mouse to look at bad intersections in the human brain, and the game shoots for you.\nThis game's strength is its visual appeal. This game is BEAUTIFUL. I can't stress enough how nice this game is just to look at. The colors and patterns are wonderful, and I'd imagine it'd be even better on a VR console.

Now, I will give you perspective as to what I was expecting and what came out. I was expecting an open minded (pun intended) kind of game. To the sense of not only just floating around a computer generated game but be able to pick things to learn about if you wanted. It had neither of those. You are on a guided course and are given direction. You complete a small and simple task by looking at stuff. Thats it. Granted the surroundings are pretty cool. Getting to see all of the diffrent nurons inside the brain to a degree, but like I said, I was hoping it was going to be more of I could explore and look at what I want when I want. Not just look at specific nurons that are cause the patient you're inside to have depresson. Moving from one area to the next seeing the same thing over and over again. It didn't cost  anything but it wasn't time well wasted either. The other draw back aside from the gameplay is the narration. They put no time into any voice over. It was a computer generated voice saying words that had been typed into a computer. So there was no flow, or over all tone. Even words with more than one syllable came out choppy.\nI wouldn't recomend this game if you're looking for an educational explore the diffrent parts of the brain experience.\n","September 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I look forward to seeing what else comes.\n\nNow though if you get motion sick prep before hand. I don't, but there were a few moments that you move so quick that it's rough. Even if you don't get motion sick I'd suggest sitting down.\n\nOnly quarrel is even after closing it out I noticed my play time still ticking up until I restarted SteamVR. Not sure why.\n\nGive it a shot just be ready for possible motion sickness.","May 15","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there's pretty much nothing educational going on in a look-and-click game, it does give a sense of things to come when software sends kids hurtling through the body as a means of teaching biology/chemistry/physics. And if you just got your VR device I suggest checking it out for the 5 minute experience. I hope that when I have kids they'll be able to learn in similar enviornments, as I would have cared far more in science class if I could hop from one neuron to the next.","May 22","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like to looking mechanic and shooting as objects are coming at you, the game is challenging and there seems like quite a bit of gamelay from what ive seen so far.\n\nAt times the looking for aim mechinic gets  abit tiresome, but overall I cant really think of abetter way of aiming unless you make it only for the vive with motion controls. maybe that could be added in a future version.","May 24","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reminds me of that movie fantastic voyage where they all get in a ship and then try to fix some president or something.\n\nThe game mechanics are basically a on rails shooter, which is fine. I like games liek that and it seems to work in VR, which is what I was playing, so I can't comment on the flat version, but i guess thats good too becuase in VR its great.

However, the "voice" needs some proofreading.  There are some points where it is clear that the original language was not English.  Nothing wrong with that, but it could use some work from a native English speaker.

Entire gameplay consists of looking at things until they turn green.\n- No educational value.\n- No way to exit application on vive without taking headset off (controllers are invisible).\n\n+ Decent graphics.\n+ Short enough that you can complete it without vomiting (I've 100% completed the game).","June 4","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
