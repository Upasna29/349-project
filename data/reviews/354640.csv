Not intently busy but more of a log in once or twice a day busy and check all the boxes that allow you to one day, have fun.\n\nYes this is a free to wait game and even paying real money, bizaarely, doesn't do all that much to help in that department. You will wait and wait and wait some more regardless of if you spend money or not. That aside the game does have gameplay to speak off and its ♥♥♥♥ poor but its better than many, many other pay2win games that are flooding our beloved Steam so I will give credit where it is due.\n\nThe game is mediocre, probabaly because everything takes a real life day or a real life week or a real life month to get done. Its like they took The Settlers and thought "what would happen if it took 24hrs to make troops instead of 24s?" and BAM, this game was born.\n\nSo there you go, The Settlers, download it, play it, get stuck, uninstall.\n\nBut there is a special spot in my shitlist for one aspect of this game.\nThe moderators, oh god the moderators! They are unpaid volunteers so you would think they would be helpful and passionate right? Noooo, they loathe you! Not me, of course because I refuse to use the chat in this game for fear of being mauled, but sooner or later you are going to get stuck.\n\nSo what do you do? ask in general chat right? WRONG! That will get you your first warning.\nYeah, its one of those enviroments.\nI won't say the mods are your worst nightmare but they really do seem to pride themselves in being on a powertrip. Its shocking really as chat becomes silent while p(l)ayers fear for their account being banned and the only conversation is another poor soul who dares reveal they are a newbie, thrown to the wolves.\n\nUbisoft, demote the free mods and just hire people instead. I know you won't, because you don't need too. People are happily paying money regardless.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hypesystem/recommended/354640/","hypesystem","hypesystem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hypesystem/","810 products in account","I was faced with this game, The Settlers Online, when I was popping by Steam to pass some time. I thought, hey, I liked the Settlers back in the day, why not give this a try. Sure, it's an "online" game, and might be simple for the times, but I liked the old-school Settlers 2, so this can't be too bad... can it?\n\nThe game starts out with a simple tutorial, getting you through the basics. Or so it seems. I still haven't made it out of this tutorial after playing for an hour, and it is basically dictating my every move. Not much for open-world civilization-building. The tutorial basically holds your hand for the entire time, and actually punishes you for thinking individually. I started building more buildings than it required, and suddenly couldn't complete the next steps of the tutorial. The tutorial steps are required for advancing levels, and levels are required for building more buildings. I was stuck. This reminds me of public school teachings, which are often more focussed on regurgitating facts than actual exploration, learning, and fun.\n\nIn addition to being an inherently fun-spoiling "read-and-repeat" experience the game is generally lacking in quality. Settlers 2 had a more convincing atmosphere, even now, 19 years after its creation. This game looks and feels like a very bad browser game with unconvincing animation; roads that "do not improve" (their wording, leaving out the subject of the sentence); mediocre graphics; unconvincing copy; etc.\n\nOne example of unconvincing copy is this: a quest describes "Bandit camps" as such:\n\nOriginally posted by Schmettlers Online:These are divided into two different types:\n1. Leader camp [...]\n2. Regular enemy camp.\n3. Contrary to leader camps [...]\n4. [... you get the gist]\nIn addition, the quests regularly fail to notice that prerequisites have been fulfilled. For example, I had to restart the game to unlock the quests for level 4 (because it hadn't noticed that I had reached said level), and upon reaching level 7 was completely stuck. Restarts didn't help it unlock the next quests, for which I had already fulfilled the prerequisites. With no way of advancing, I was, again, stuck. This time for good.\n\nI spent around an hour playing this game, thinking, "maybe soon it will let me out of the tutorial, and, you know, actually play." It didn't. Don't play this game. It is a waste of time. It is hardly a game.\n\nAt least the "quit" button has an instant effect.","August 20, 2015","false","1.1"," 74 of 82 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","74","82","7","0"

Having the Settler IP doesn't make this game an exception extraordinaire it just a dime'o dozen.\n\nThe screenshots pretty much sums up your whole visual experience of the game.\n\nThe ingame currency (Gems) can be earn by completing quests / adventures but on the other hand everything can be purchased with that currency as well.

Overall it's just a bland ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of better settlers games with a social network feature bolted on which allows them to call it an MMO.\n\nI went into this with an open mind, hell, if I got 4 hours of fun out of this free game I'd recommend it. Things is, I didn't get 30 minutes of playtime in before new buildings were taking ten minutes to build. The graphics are uninspiring, the quests are overly complex right from the start of the game, and BlueByte removed one of the defining mechanics endemic to the franchise: flags.\n\nIf you are looking for a free to play game with a full settlers experience try Widelands instead. It may have a bit higher of a learning curve but your time will be better rewarded instead of dealing with this shovelware.\n\nIf you'd like to hear more of my thoughts on the game check out the video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/aC0NRKckl_Y","October 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 42 of 57 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","42","57","3","0"

The chat was/is strictly monitored so you actually get to speak with adults and not just "insulting teenagers" which is refreshing. The community is very mature and very helpful they answer your questions and are very polite. But then it goes just wrong. when you ask a question in the wrong chat tab you get shut down, then when you ask in the right one you get told you should have read the info, i should have known what to ask before it happened. The game is so linear (you cant do much freely its already decided how and what to do) and time consuming. that the "old" playerbase knows all and avoids the deadends/requirements/threshholds and know what to do and prepare for before it happens. Then the "new" players do some small mistake and they are in for a heap of trouble or get left out completely, during an event for example. I got told "there is info about the event out there", i didnt know you had to study for a game if you wanted to play or that i should know everything about what question i should ask before i know what to ask for. To correct a mistake can and probably will take days if its even possible to correct. I got told 3 days in to the Halloween event that "you should have buffed the cemeterys from day one" now there are 16 days left off the 20 day event and im already out when it comes to gathering enough pumpkins. There are several guides out there that describes ON THE DOT what to do, if you do the smallest thing different or even worse try to figure it out by yourself like most other games, you can fail miserably and then you need to build like another army the next 3 days or tear down buildings to build the correct amount, loss of resources can make you stop completely with several days of delay as result, This is not a game for the fps/real time crowd. Even me that enjoys "marathon" games find this game unbearably slow. I saw the TSO game here on steam and started with lots of other steam players, last i checked their islands where pretty much abandoned and now after 3 weeks im still at level 33 and there are i think 75 levels, as i said this game isnt for everybody.","October 24, 2015","false","004.7"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","27","37","3","0"

My entire time spent in the game was either waiting for a timer to finish counting down or navigating a menu. There were no clear objectives, no stakes, no intrigue, and no challenge.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown had the tutorial done and the objectives set in less than 5 minutes, even shorter if you took the option to skip the opening tutorial. Battle Nations, an example of what I consider to be a free-to-wait game actually done correctly, handed you a battle to fight it out while you built up your resources and troops to take on a looming threat, all the while the premium currency can be earned and is entirely optional for one to have.\n\nBut this game? Nothing. Just "build buildings, stockpile resources". If one were to take out the timers, then this game might have a chance at building up a decent pacing. As it stands, I was falling asleep and I wasn't even a half-hour into it.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about it is that during said time I wasn't badgered into spending money on premium currency.

First of let me get this out of the way. Yes you can "spend money".\nSo if that's a problem then move on. This is not your type of game.\n\nBefore we are going to start\n------------------------------\nWhat is a game you can ask. Is it worth playing my time? Well depend on what you like to do. i`m a casual player\nthat's said, i have not many time to play games. Yes my account say something els. I know times moves forward.\nThis means in the mean time i got kids got married and so on. So time to play games is rare. Or the games need to be\nlike settlers waiting games. (Or people say waiting to play). This kind of games i can dig in. I can open the game. Click\nor place a building and move on with doing something els like watching my kid playing or eating my dinner and so on.\nThis is the perfect games i can do and i like to do. So if you want a harcore 24/7 focus games then move on.\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\nSo i play some hours but let be honest here its more the part that's the game is open. Real playing total is i think 40 hours at max. I`m max level in this game. (not with the steam account) but with a older account.\nSo why steam account? I like playing games on steam. Just for the stats or achievements or cards/badge. Also i want to apologize for my bad English or Grammar or both. I try to do my best.\n\nThe game\n-----------\nI will start out with +(positive) and - (negative) points.\nThe game is about building a home and harvest resource. And that's it. The rest is a option. Well almost but we talk later about that.\n\nPositive\n--------\n+ Art design\n+ Sound Effects\n+ Easy to play\n+ Works flawless on my pc/laptop/tablet\n+ Relax play\n+ People are most of the time friendly in game\n+ community Very Friendly people (not steam community) sorry\n+ Questing\n+ Achievements\n+ Great events\n+ Daily quests\n+ Guild events and questing is fun little challenge sometimes but fun\n+ Buildings tactics and placements are challenging.\n+ Great deep advance buildings to increase resource.\n\nNegative\n- Balance\n- Pay to Win militia\n- Static view island will stay the same unless you activate a skin that's cost money or gold currents and is not permanent.\n- Leveling up will halt on level 32 after that you can only leveling up if you do adventures. That`s will cost resource and if you f*ck it up then to bad your lost your stuff and lost your adventure map.\n- Advancing for level you need to search adventures. This cost time and cost resource to find it.\n- You can instantly ban if you trade with your "alt" account or account that's belong  from some one els in your household.\n- Questing is a bit doll. You need to do this to earn XP without XP you can not unlock mines or anything but after level 32 the questing will stop there. Only your open quest can be done but those questing you need to level up first so back to adventures yeah.... not.\n- PVP no comment.\n\nFinal vote\n-------------\nDo i like it. Yes but after level 32 its no fun at all. There is the questing ends and adventures starts and boy you will hate them. Like i do. And before your going to rage yes i`m max level so i have done them all.....\n\nIn the current state i will say : Vote down so NO. To many things thats are disappointment.\n\nSo if your up for this and do not mind to play adventures or uhm pvp yeah pvp...\nThen this is your game and if you do not like adventures then perhaps the first 32 levels are fun.\n\nAlso a note. Do not buy anything unless your earning gems from the game it self. Your "advantage or progress" is fake. Your just wasting real money for stuff that`s no need to pay. If you have earn those gems there are couple of great buildings that helps along but THAT'S IT. Do not waste your money.

The core to it is whether you can easily see your Settlement growing, and whether there's interesting challenges facing you to overcome, either limited resources or enemy Settlers you must outpace.\n\nHere... You have stationary, fixed enemy encampments that dont do anything. And confusing tutorials, badly defined mission targets and inconsistent translation. And long, long, LONG, LOOOOOOONG waits before resources come in.  There's literally nothing to do but click a few buttons, set up your construction queues, and come back later to see if you've enough resources to clear one more bandit camp or build one more item.\n\nIt's not a game, it's a system of timers masquerading as a game. I wasn't hit by the Level 7 bug, but you also can't see your Settlers consistently (they don't seem to carry resources from storage to production very often), the keyboard camera controls often don't work, right clicking even once brings up the Flash options menu that you can't easily get out of... for such a simple browser game, it's horribly coded.\n\nThere's a quest for adding people to your friends list. Of the 4 who have shared it with me, only one seems to have played beyond their first day in game, and even he might have quit by now... I've not, yet, because I'm a sucker for the Settlers and every now and I kind of like logging in now and then to set the little numbers rising; but I'm also not blind. It's a terrible game, and unworthy of it's classic pedigree.","August 28, 2015","false","634.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

If you have never played the game in the browser it's ok I guess but there isn't really any reason to have it on Steam, the browser version works fine if not better.

It's one of the most boring games ever made. It does not fit on a PC. Clearly the publisher saw the revenue coming in from the mobile phone versions of these types of games and thought, "Hey, why don't we try to get some of that money too, but here's a twist, lets do it on PC!"\n\nWell, while I'd like to say his idea is a failure, as from a gaming perspective it truly is. The thing is, this game is so cheaply made, and weighs in at a whopping 87 mb, you can tell not much work went into making it. So development costs must have been extremely small. The game is so simple, server costs can't be much of anything, and you know SOMEBODY is going to fork over some money. There are plenty of people who do that on the mobile phones, which I can never understand. These games aren't fun, they're tedious. It's like you're logging in to do your job, not playing to have fun.\n\nIn case you didn't know, this is one of those games where you place a building to be made, then you wait however many minutes for it to be made. You then wait however many minutes for resources to be produced by it. Then you wait however many minutes for people to locate more resources, and so on.\n\nThis game really, really sucks, and I wish these types of games would disappear. Luckily, it's free, and you can get your requisite 3 Steam Trading Cards from it. I'm going to wait my 2 some odd hours for them, then uninstall, and never look at this game again.","August 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Firstly, it is a browser game (which doesn't mean its all bad but does limit functunality). Secondly, you have to know why the thing doesn't load first time - you have to go into settings and change from Google Chrome Flash Plugin to Adobe Flash Plugin to get anything to load.\n\nOnce you are in the game, you then go through tutorial quests, which was fine to understand how to play the game. But after about 15 minutes or so of this you then find you have to build a Tavern, which takes 10 real minutes to build and you have other tasks to build foresters etc and unfortunately you cannot build more than one thing at a time (initially, I presume). To speed this building process up, the pay element comes into the Freemium game...\n\nSoon as the 10 minutes of boredom was up, I decided not to play the game any longer. Not recommended. I'll go back to classic Settlers!","August 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

(See what i mean by nice administering??).\nWhile language, attitude, hacking and stuff like that needs to be managed ofc but i fail to see what the game developers are asking for when they make a seperate browser game and a steam game where you CANNOT link the accounts together.\nI actually only wanted to play the steam version to in order to see the differences between the game versions and i got permabanned for that. I had been playing the steam version for 2 hours XD\n\nThis game in its enterity is a great game but because of poor administration and way too many limited options that the player is alowed to get, even though you spend over 2000 hours, alot of money and soooooo much effort on building you get nothing but disrespect. I have always recommended this game until i realized how limited this game really is and how poorly managed it is, with no respect for their hard working players that have always supported the game.\n\nHowever im actually relieved to get the permaban because i actually stopped playing this game and its a huge relieve. However i regret spending quite a bit of money and time on it though.\nIt's like a super maniac facebook game that requires you spend at least 2-3 hours a day in order to keep everything managed in game.\nWhile i actually enjoy that, im hugely relieved to finally stop playing this madness lol. Its a horrible point and click mmo.\nDo yourself a favor and dont play this nonsense.","January 8","false","1.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I defended the developers as well as the game because I enjoyed playing it years ago on a browser and again when it hit Steam. Until....\n\nI noticed something in my notifitations that I never seen before. I had a notification from a moderator saying I was permenantly banned from the forum for suppoesed "Insulting other players" which never happened. I would tell you to go read the post yourself, but it seems to have vanished. The mod deleted my post and banned me but all the other people bashing the game still linger on the forum. Seems pretty backwards to me.\n\nScreenshot of message:  http://i.imgur.com/sZDqICq.png\n\nI made a post saying the game is free to play and people have nothing to lose by trying it and someone else responded saying it wasn't free to play since it "spends your time". I told him that made no sense since he was active on the forum and still played the game and insists on making critical posts about the game. I made a comment saying his post was "contradictive filth" and the mod thought I was insulting him directly.\n\nIt's ironic that one of the few who defended the game and the developers got banned, yet the ones who continue to bash the game can still be found on the forum. It's clear who the developers want on their side. For this I decided to change my review and give it a downvote and tell people to stay far far away from this game. Developers like this don't deserve business, they deserve to get shut down. I will make damn sure that I never give them any business in the future as well as to tell others about the shady way they treat their fan base.\n\n\n\n\nOld review below:\n\n"If you enjoy city building games then this is one you want to try. It's free so you have nothing to lose.\n\nYou're given a ton of quests to complete on top of a constant growing economy. The map you play on is massive and filled with enemies that you must defeat in order to expand your claimed land. This game also has features like guilds, black market for trading, friends list (friends can visit each other), PvP, special events, rankings, a world chat, and a new island that is said to be bigger than the one you start with (which is already massive).\n\nThere is an in game store where you can buy many different items with in game currency but it's not as bad as the terrible Steam community thinks it is. You can choose to buy in game currency with real money, BUT you can also earn it pretty easily just by playing the game (which is one thing the Steam community seems to be against). So it gives you a chance to get the same items as people who spend real money to save time.\n\nOne thing I have a huge problem with is how the Steam community sees a free to play game and instantly bash it and call it garbage because it has microtransactions. How else are the developers going to make money? If you enjoy the game (which you got for FREE) then what's so wrong with showing support? Nobody is forcing you to play or spend money so how does that make a game bad? As a kid who was gaming in to late 80's and early 90's I would've loved to have games for free but I was never that lucky and had to wait for a birthday. Kids now have thousands of games for FREE and the moment they see a microtransaction they call it an abomination.\n\nTry it before you judge."","August 20, 2015","false","20.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Should not have made that mistake. Would've probably realized I tried this as a browser game a while back and hated it. Put a lot more time into it then than now, but nothing has changed from what I see.\n\nThe fact that it is a browser game is not what's wrong, some browser games can be fun, but this game is boring, uneventful and lacks anything to compel you to return every day to check on it. It's a shame as I grew up playing Settlers and this game is just a disappointment.\n\nPro:\nIt's free, light and take less than minute to install and to uninstall. If you have an s-grade computer and need games to play... you might be desperate enough to like it.\n\nCons:\nAll around boring and bad game, even for browser based "strategy".\n\nBut hey, it's just my opinion.

But if you're on an actual computer with Steam, you have so many better titles, both paid and F2P, to choose from.\n\nOr hell, just spend the $5 and get yourself an old Settlers title, if you're aching for this sort of game.

All they care about is tricking you into spending via micro transactions (or not so micro). You will need to spend at least €30-60 just to get a playable gameor wait two or more years of daily logins to accumulate enough in-game currency (gems) for the required content.\n\nHorrible flash interface with tiny illegible fonts. Crashes often, freezes more often. Horrible nasty flash brokenness. It locks up for many seconds every time you get an in-game email.\n\nThe rating is PEGI7 which is horribly inappropriate for this game. There is no reason for 7 years olds to be banned from it, it just isn't interesting for kids. The rules forbid you from even discussing the rules in the in-game chat (horribly implemented broken irc clone) and you will be banned for using completely words like "tart" or "hummer" (discussing recipes and cars respectively). This is exacerbated by the repeatedly poor judgement exhibited by MODs and BlueByte employees.\n\nAdventures are poorly balanced so despite a large amount of content you end up doing the same 2-5 adventures over and over again. BlueByte also refuse to support a key strategic mechanism (blocking) which is essential to differentiate this game from competing money-grabbing mobile games.\n\nThere are 2 ways to log on, via steam or via a web browser. If you want to try it do NOT create an account via steam, if you do you won't be able to log on via a standard web browser.\n\nAny attempt at suggesting game improvements in global chat is ignored, at best you get told to post on the forum where suggestions are also ignored.\n\nProblems with this game are myriad and on many levels. From corporate greed to an inept dev team to poor technology choices and no vision or leadership of the development path. This is an enourmous pity given the predecessors, I still fondly remember The Settlers II on the Amiga.\n\nThis could be and should be a great game but it isn't.","February 23","false","213.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you have no concept of what that is, then you should research it or just walk away. A lot of the game time is spent waiting for something to get done, this has always been the case even in previous incarnations. It requires a lot of patience to even get your island off the ground and then new challenges and supply inputs will be introduced.\n\nPersonally I like the game because of the challenge of building smooth-running supply chains, hence the recommendation, but with the caveat that it takes a certain mindset to enjoy the game.","September 3, 2015","true","792.6"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","12","30","3","0"
