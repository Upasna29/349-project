The version of Hive I played is a pre-release version and thus subject to changes, but with 6 hours under my belt I feel I am able to give at least a reasonable assessment of what BlueLine Game Studios[bluelinegamestudios.com] have done with Gen42 Games' work.\n\nPublished in 2001, the original Hive is a strategy board game without a board, like with Settlers of Catan the game uses a hex based tile system to create the environment of play, but Hive differs greatly from the beloved German classic.  Hive has no fixed play area, it's tiles are it's units and can be played and moved based on a very Chess-like set of structured rules.  The game is an enjoyable and varied one which lets players go through a game quickly against their opponent with no need to set up the board or learn too many rules.  An additional bonus to the game is that it is largely language-agnostic, once the rules are known nothing in the game requires any kind of reading to cause issues between players.\n\nThis PC version of the game sticks well to the original game and implements the ruleset in a very by-the-book manner that gives no room for house rules, like modifying the unit list of the two players, which is a double edged sword - on one hand you aren't overloaded with a multitude of options in your face from the onset, but you are also limited in what you can do with the game, there are no handicaps.  The game comes with the original Hive's expansion, the Pillbug, a single unit that most players would make a cardboard stand-in for when playing the physical game, in the game as purchasable DLC, which most PC gamers will agree has a sting to it, after seeing the PC version of Settlers of Catan, called simply Catan, one would hope all developers put as much love into their titles, including all expansions and many differing options for how to play.\n\nArtificial Intelligence in this game on the lower levels is not overly resource hungry, but suffers from being a little daffy at times, on the highest level the opposite is true however.  When playing on the 5th difficulty level you can occasionally wait a couple of minutes as it plays out possible moves it can take before settling on one and it makes for a much better fight, if a sometimes boring wait.\n\nThe musical selection is somewhat boring and repetitive, the game has a single and rather short track that repeats before you eventually disable audio playback after hour one of the song playing with your mind.  One assumes it is a placeholder awaiting a little more variety in the playlist.\n\nInterface for the game is a rather bare-bones at this stage, clean and responsive, but not overly attractive.  The camera auto-zooms and includes the entire play area in your view, this is again both a good and bad thing, as I could find no means to change my camera angle, which is helpful in a game when you are in a difficult situation and want to get a fresh perspective on the game.  Tool tips are in your face, unavoidable, and unclosable, you have to wait on them to fade away on their own, which is quite bothersome when you only want to see if a unit can move or not.  There is presently no customization to the game, one cannot change the game's colours, nor use alternative tilesets to make the game more aesthetically appealing.\n\nAs there are no options to change resolution, modify volume, go to fullscreen instead of windowed mode, or change the graphics of the tiles, the game feels a little more limited than what many PC gamers might expect or even demand from a game.  But the game is enjoyable in spite of it's presently simple presentation, one hopes that BlueLine will take what they have and move forward with the ability to control the camera, to change tilesets, unit lists and add a little more polish to the visual and auditory aspects of the title.  I can easily say the game is a good one, I am just unsure if Steam users will be able to get past it's aesthetic limitations to the boardgame underneath.  For strategy board game fans, this is likely a no-brainer to pick it up, but others will probably be less enthusiastic about the title as when it comes to boardgame adaptions, PC gamers tend to be more into Axis and Allies level complexity, and less into Chess.","December 5, 2013","true","13.8"," 60 of 83 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","60","83","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FaberPastel/recommended/251210/","FaberPastel","Faber Pastel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FaberPastel/","959 products in account","Análisis en español aquí[tny.cz]\nI can barely recomend this game. It is good but a small amount of issues makes it not so pleasurable as it should.\n\n*Introduction\nFor start I should explain what this game is about, without going into details about the rules and moves of each type of piece.\nHive is a well known tabletop game for two player. It doesn't use a board, instead players take turns to place or move their hexagonal pieces (representing bugs) contacting one another and thus forming the playing area (hive). Each type of piece has its own move (like chess). The goal is surround the opponent's queen bee while we protect our own queen.\nHive is a very good game, awarded over here and over there, by these and those people. The description of the Steam store handles make it clear that it is a awarded game. It's a game with not too much rules to learn, easy to play. Still the game has a lot of strategy to consider. Move or place? Attack or defend? Which and how many bugs play or conserve?\n\n*Gameplay\nThe game stays true to the rules of the tabletop game and therefore it's played practically the same, except for the difference we not have to wonder if every move is valid. Just click on on of your pieces and it will be show the places where we can place it with another click.\nAbout the AI, it can take too long time to decide to move, especially in higher difficulties, so the match will always be interrupted. Also the AI is not very smart in higher difficulties.\n\n*Graphic user interface\nThe menu is simple and minimalist. That is usually good, but this time it's taken to the extreme scarcing in basic options such as selecting screen resolution.\nWhen a match is created you can choose how to compete with our rival (remember that it's a two players game). We can play against artificial intelligence on 5 difficulties, on line through Steam, and two local modes, each player with its own peripheral (keyboard and gamepad) or sharing the same peripheral (pass and play).\nDuring the match, the playground is a wooden surface, on which we will place the pieces. The pieces are placed or moved, first by clicking them and then clicking on one of the marked areas. The pieces can't be dragged.\nWe can control the point of view but not the zoom, which is automatically adjusted to make visible all pieces.\n\n*Audio\nIt can be summarized as boring and repetitive. Little choice and very boring. I know it must not distract players, but it is soooo boring that is annoying and you will end up turning it off. As a curiosity I can mention that some sound effects and music are free from Freesound.org and OpenGameArt.\n\n* Online gaming\nAs multiplayer game, online gaming should be an important part. In this section we can create and join public and private lobby, although the private ones can only be joined by invitation.\nIt has an ELO rating system (like chess and go). This is a scoring system to calculate the skill level of the players. So when creating a game we can choose whether we want it to be "rated game" or not. That is if we want to bear in mind that rating system for the match or not.\nIt doesn't have online player waiting to play. It's one of those games you must play with friends since you can not find random players.\nAn important negative point is that the online game often fails, forcing you to restart it. That doesn't always happen, only in matches you think you are going to win. I don't know how that affects your score because I have not played with that option enabled, but I suspect it should not be good since my opponent informed me that the game notify him I abandoned the match when it failed and we had to start another one.\nOne last detail in this section. The game requires Steam to play online. An important detail to note as it is advertised as DRM-free on the dev's website via Humble widget.\n\n*DLC\nSomething you should know is that the game is incomplete, it has missing pieces. These missing pieces are sold separately as DLC. As a result you get an incomplete game and additional parts cost almost as much as the base game ($10 base game and $3 each of 3 DLC, $19 total), although there are discounts for purchasing bundles. Unfortunately, developers planned to sell the game this way from the begining. Probably they developed the game thinking about the DLC. They justify this by comparing it with the physical version of the game (a comparison that does not seem appropriate to me). As if that were not enough to buy an intentionally incomplete game, each DLC gives only one piece which is distasteful (remember that it's about pieces of a tabletop game, not hats or skins). These extra pieces already existed at the time of game release, they didn't have to think and create new pieces.\nIf you own a DLC, you can use it in a match although your competitor doesn't own it, both player obtaining additional parts. That means that content is included for all in the game and is not an optional extra download, but is locked until you shell out more money. Note that we talk about pieces of a tabetop game and not about hats or cosmetic items, for a paid game, not a F2P in which would be acceptable.\n\nPros:\n+ It's Hive and maintains its rules.\n+ Online multiplayer.\n+ It has artificial intelligence so that those who are "forever alone" can enjoy it.\n\nCons:\n- DLC based business model. The game is incomplete and you must pay almost double for the extra pieces (every DLC offers one miserable piece). $19 for the full game is very overpriced for a game like this with all the drawbacks.\n- Repetitive and boring music.\n- Few options. Not much to modify to your pleasure. You can not change the game screen resolution, to do this you must change the desktop resolution. You can not control the zoom.\n- Artificial intelligence is slow. This is more noticeable in higher difficulties.\n- No online players (though no fault of the game).\n- DLC. I have already said it, no?\n- It is only available in English. It is not necessary to know english to play if you know the rules. Conversely, if you do not know them, you must learn them in english. Language can be a barrier and this may impair the growth of the community.\n- Online matches usually fail.\n- No low-end system friendly.\n\nI should mention that many of the comments and analysis  I read are outdated. Some corrections:\n- Camara and perspective. Now we can move the camera, but the zoom is adjusted automatically.\n- Options. You can play in windowed mode or full screen and can also change the volume of music (can be lowered to not hear it) and sound effects. Can not change the resolution yet.\n- Appearance and aesthetics. Now you can choose the tileset between 3 options: Standard (with 3D bugs), Classic (as the classical version of the game) and Carbon (black and white as carbon edition physical version). Pop-ups are less obtrusive and pieces no longer float, now are sustained on a wooden table.\n- Artificial intelligence. It has been improved both in their deciciones as in the time it takes. It is still slow in higher difficulties.\n- Missing pieces. The missing pieces are sold as DLC.\n- It is not DRM-free. No, it's not. It is advertised as such but to play online you need Steam. You can copy the program files but only work to play without internet connection.\n\nEdit: Since I wrote this review, there was an update that fixes some online problems (some of which I was a victim). I didn't test it yet.","June 26, 2014","true","13.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

However, there is some minor wonkiness with the interface:\n1. You can't pan around because it really isn't necessary, but this causes an effect with some tile placements where you have to find the portion of the tile at the top which isnn't being obscured by other text.\n2. There are announcements that are displayed when a move repeats a previous hive configuration that are very distracting and practically useless because they obscure the playfield.\n3. The developers used this 3D zoom-out display mechanic that automatically scales the playfield to hold the tile configuration, even when there is only one huge tile on the playfield at the very beginning of the game.\n\nDespite these minor problems, the game is very enjoyable and is the perfect distraction for ten minutes between other activities.\n","May 20, 2015","true","12.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","3"

I definitely should've paid more attention to what each piece can do and not tried right off the bat to beat the hardest difficulty. When I lowered the difficulty back to normal, I was able to win several games and explore several different strategies. I bought the DLCs with it because I got the game on sale and wanted to see how the ladybug, mosquito, and pillbug added to the gameplay and strategical depth. On the surface, it looked relatively simple, but once I got about an hour into it, I saw just how much there is to this game.\nThe object of the game is just to surround your opponent's queen bee piece on all it's sides. To do that, you and your opponent take turns moving or placing different bugs to create the game board (called the hive). There's the army ant, which can move any number of spaces along a straight line. It can't go over any pieces, however. There's also the grasshopper that has to move in a straight line hopping over pieces as it goes. There's a beetle that can climb on top and over any piece. Any piece that it's resting on top of can't move as long as the beetle is on top of it. All the beetles can be stacked on top of each other, too, but I'm not sure that there's any reason to do that. MY favorite is the spider which always moves 3 spaces. It can't go up and over pieces and always has to move 3 spaces. It's one of the trickiest pieces to work with, but extremely satisfying when used successfully. The queen bee always has to be placed by your 4th turn and can only move 1 space at a time-kind of like the king in chess. That's it for the main game's bugs. Together they provide a decent amount a variety to the strategies that can be used, but like I said, I got the DLCs for it, so I also get to use the ladybug, mosquito, and pillbug. Each of them has a special ability that makes them uniquely powerful for certain situations. The mosquito can be the most powerful piece in the game and the weakest. Alone, it has no ability to move, but it's special ability is that it can copy the movement abilities of any piece that it is touching. And yes, that means, the more pieces, the more abilities. The ladybug is a little strange. It can move on top of the hive (other pieces on the game board) for 2 spaces, but then it has to come back down. It's extremely useful in certain situations. And lastly is the pillbug. It's the piece I've used the least in the game so far, but it can be a real life saver. It moves like the queen (only 1 space at a time) but it has the unique ability to be able to move any piece that touches it-regardless of whether it's yours or the enemy's. It can only move one piece a turn, but still, if used correctly, like I said, it can be a live saver.","March 19","true","11.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's pretty rare to see PC versions of board games on Steam with a solid AI. If you like strategy board games at all, I definitely recommend getting this game. If you want to add another layer of depth and difficulty to the game, get the amazing DLC.\n\n==== Review ====Rules\nHive is a Mensa Select award winning board game, and this Steam game with the same name manages to bring the tabletop fun to a virtual platform. For those that have never played Hive before, your objective is to surround the opponent's "Queen" with your various "Insect" pieces. Each "Insect" has a particular moveset, similar to Chess pieces, that will force you to really think hard about where to move your bugs. The board is created using the "Insect" tiles you place.\n\nGame Modes\nFrom the same developers that brought Reversi to Steam, similar game options are present. You have the ability to: play against AI with multiple difficulty levels, pass and play for local coop, or play online against other users. The online feature provides a game browser with custom matches including ranked play. You even have the ability to utilize asynchronous play - you can quit the game and receive a notification when it's your turn. The online community seems to be present, with a decent amount of open games observed on the online browser.\n\nAI Difficulty\nRegarding solo play, the AI is moderately difficult on Queen and above difficulty levels (Brood < Drone < Worker < Queen < Hive Mind). Even though the DLC "Insects" greatly enhance the depth of Hive, the base game is already robust enough for complex matches. I am glad the game shows you possible move locations as the rules can get a little tricky to keep track of.\n\nDLC\nThe Pillbug, Ladybug, and Mosquito expansions add three new "Insects" with new and unique abilities. The Pillbug is the only method to directly move an opponent's piece, and also has the ability to lock the opponent from moving that piece in the next turn. The Mosquito inherits abilities of any piece it touches, while the Ladybug combines the movement of the Beetle and Spider pieces. From this description alone, it should be easy to imagine how these DLC "Insects" will change your gameplay.\n\nYou have the ability to activate each expansion separately, in case there is an "Insect" that you don't like playing with.

I never played the physical version.  I just came across this on sale and bought a two pack for myself and a co worker to try it.  We played a few times and then I bought another 2 pack for the other guys in the office.  Fun game.\n\nAs a program it works well.  The controls are easy.  Not clunky at all.  I love that you can take days between turns.  Not that we have had to do that, but our job is such that we can't just sit and look at the game board.  Being able to walk away for 30 minutes or an hour...etc., and not miss your turn is a great option.  Perfect game to have in the background and just take your turn whenever you get the chance.\n\nThe original tileset provides a good game and then the DLC just expands it that much more.\n\nDefinitely worth it for board game fans, and strategy fans.  Fun to play with others on different computers in the same room.  Probably fun with random stangers online, although I haven't done that yet.","February 12","true","101.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Just answer these questions:\n-Do you like Chess?\n-Do you want to play Chess with different rules?\n-Do you want to play Chess on an open board?\nIf you answered "Yes" to all then this game is for you.\n\nBasically, Hive is an open minded Chess game. The strategy feels simular, yet different, and possibly more challenging. You get to choose what pieces you want to play and how to play them. You can play agressive or defencive, based on your set up. This being said, I think most people who like Chess will like Hive.\n\nThe one drawback I have so far is that to play online you have to sign up with an account not connected to steam. So I've only played against the AI. They have been challenging enough for me and enjoyable. However, I've only put 2.5 hours into the game and have beaten the hardest level AI. You can play against friends locally with just one copy of the game as well so that's a huge plus!

On top, we have ALL the expansions available, hence mosquito, ladybug, pillbug.\n\nRegarding other option, the multiplayer game works very well, but it's a great shame that there are very few opponents to play with.\n\nThe AI, considering how complex is a game like HIVE, is fairly good but I've played too few matches to judge it and I'm a novice player.\n\nWhat I said until now are the PROS, obviously there are little CONS.\n\nThe multiplayer game is only syncronous, maybe an asyncronous mode will be very useful, considering the penury of online opponents.\n\nThe camera has an auto-zoom function that controls zoom-in/zoom-out in automatic way. Very often it works well, but I prefer the option to disable it and take the control of the camera to choose the % of desidered zoom level.\n\nIn concljusion if you like board games, abstract games or -simply- funny games, buy HIVE and join our little group of HIVE players!","January 11, 2015","true","31.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Like the graphics and the overall idea. Not played the board game although I am a particular board / card game fan (old school and computerised versions)\nThis reminds me (for those of you who haven't played the board game already) of a cross between chess and drafts. Mainly chess. There are quite a few moves to remember and will take a while to become proficient. However, the game highlights the areas which each peice can move to. I have only played in the "novice" mode so far so I don't know if this continues through the levels or indeed via online options. ( only played the computer who was very kind at that level and I won LOL It could have beat me at least five moves before I eventually worked out some stratergy)\nI have purchased the full expantions which make the game more interesting too which I am pleased I did. I have bought it for my partner and am looking forward to playing via the net in a private game. There is also a lobby where you can pit against others which is a good option for any type of board / card game :)\nSo; Like the graphics\nLike the concept\nSo far 10/10 will update if I change my mind after more game play but very plesaed so far","June 27, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This version seems to be a direct port of the mobile platform, and while I've not had issues with gameplay, it did freeze when I went to look at the extras.  Not a big deal.  Well-designed in terms of how the various pieces interact, and their distributions.  Personally, I think the game isn't fully realized without the DLC, and those pieces should have been included with the basic game, otherwise your limited options will often leave you playing to a draw.  The AI doesn't start to get difficult until you set it to Hive Mind, but that might just be from my own familiarity with the physical game.  I gifted a copy to a friend in case we ever want to play, but otherwise I don't envision myself playing online much.  Recommended at full price for fans of abstract strategy games.  Hive's hex tiles and spatial fluidity are a nice change from other games in this genre.","January 23","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Each piece is one of a variety of insects, and each has its own rules governing how it may move in play. The rules are simple, but play is deep; there are infinite board configurations. It's somewhat chess-like in that respect.\n\nThere's single player and multiplayer. With many games the multiplayer depends upon who else wants to play at the time, but If you can't find someone to play when you hop on, you can go to 'Create Game', make a non-private game, click 'Ready' then 'Start Alone', ESCape and 'leave game' -- and your game will wait around for somebody to join it, even if you're not online :)\n\nThis incarnation of Hive (the best ones are real world copies you can take to the pub!) is charming. The pieces make cute chirping noises when they move... the background music is a little repetitive (but if you turn it off, after a while I think you'll miss it).\n\nDefinitely worth the investment.","April 30","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gist of it is that each turn, players can either place a hexagonal piece on the playfield, or move a piece that is already placed. Each piece represents a different bug, and each type of bugs has different rules of movement. The goal is to surround the other player's queen bee. Like any truly great board game, the ruleset is easy to learn, but hard to master. This game has that "just one more game" quality to it, where if you lose, you've got to play another round because you're just so close to beating it. The ai is fantastic and does a good job of scaling to the various difficulty levels. I really enjoy this game and it seems like the developers are adding more to it. The DLC pieces are well worth getting as well, as they add some great mechanics to the game. Overall, this is a must-have for fans of board games on Steam.","June 10, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Wait time for an online game is usually upwards of 20 minutes. It's best to get this game if you already kind of have someone you're going to play it with.]\n\nThe boardgame version is an instant classic, and so I got really excited once I saw it on Steam. My brother and I love the game, so I picked up a 2-pack and sent him a copy. Thanks, steam sale!\n\nFor those of you who haven't played it before, think of this as a fast-paced version of Chess based on insects. Instead of your pieces arrayed on the board, you actually create the board as you lay pieces down one by one and move them around. Very fluid. A typical game will only take you around 5 minutes, though, not 5 hours. The base game is fun, though the expansion DLC is a must-buy to enjoy the game's full potential.\n\nMy main concern was with how the game would look and play, especially since it's a port. The trailer left a bit to be desired.\n\nFirst impressions after a half hour of play:\n- Visuals are crisp and fluid, much better than you'd think from viewing the trailer.\n- Music gets old, fast.\n- AI is good enough to give you a challenge, especially if you're new to the game or just kind of rusty. I've busted through the first 3 tiers of AI in about 30 minutes.\n- Love having the ability to change the visual style of the pieces. Charcoal (the grayscale) is my favorite. Wasn't too keen on the '3D' style. A little disappointed that there isn't any way to visually customize the, er, 'table' that you're playing on, but this is a tiny gripe at best.\n- Multiplayer seems ... functional? I guess? There were only 3 people on when I tried, all of whom I guess were AFK, so couldn't test it. There is an online mode though so that makes me happy. There's also hotseat for those who want that.\n- Multiplayer lobby lacks a chat function. That sucks. I've had to deal with the same problem in other games, though, especially with XBox ports. Form a steam group, I guess -_-\n\nAll and all it's a faithful representation of the game with only very minor drawbacks, and well worth the money. A 2-pack with all DLC is going for 11 bucks right now for the summer sale.","June 19, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The Steam version looks good, but I initially had some problems with it.\n\n-When playing with extra pieces online, the game will sometimes lock up when a player uses one of the "extra" pieces like the Mosquito. After contacting Blue Line, I was told that it could be an issue with my virus scanner (Total Defense), and it was.\n\n-One time, the computer assumed that I had no moves to make. This gave the computer unlimited moves to surround my Queen. This only happened once, and it's possible that the game was correct. Unfortunately, the computer resolved the turn so fast that I couldn't see what happened.\n\n-It is not made clear that the play area can be rotated for a better view of the pieces. When pieces get stacked, it's possible to block the view of adjacent pieces on the far side of the camera.\n\nBesides the above issues, this version is very polished. It has online play, hotseat play, different displays, and different levels of difficulty for the AI. I hope Blue Line fixes the above issues, and creates new computer versions of awesome board games.","July 11, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I am no expert at this game, but I would not equate this game to either Chess or Go.  There is simply not enough gameplay and depth to the game.  In Chess and Go, there is much more to both strategy and tactics, while here there is very little. The games move through stages of strategy and tactics so quickly that there is really little time to develop strategy during the game itself.  There is no room for any kind of intuitive game play, like the early stage in go, either.  I think once you learn the rules of the pieces well, you will probably do well in this game.\nOverall, I say the concept is interesting, but something is missing from the game to add real strategy and increased depth to the tactical side.  If you enjoy a higher paced version of chess with fewer pieces and quicker results, this might be good for you.  I enjoy the depth of Go much more and the give and take of the game.\n\nAlso, as others have said, the online community does not exist.

I usually win when I play someone else, but this Steam version has amazing A.I.! I cannot beat it on the medium level! I can get it to a draw, but it's a challenge. I cannot imagine what the two levels above medium are like! The interface for the game evokes the board game very well.\n\nSo if you never played the board game, will you like this? I think the game is genius. It is more brilliant than chess because it has all the elements of chess plus a "board" that gets built by the players, so each board is different each time, all driven by another brilliant aspect--you start with no pieces and decide which to introduce into the game, one by won. Maybe you love grasshoppers (they are a key piece against good players) or hate spiders (I do too...the most worthless piece...which is why I usually make it my anchor starting piece). The fun of the game is seeing how the various pieces move and work together and how they counter each other.\n\nI would say if you hate pure strategy games, including chess, avoid this game. If you like games like chess, this is better. Get it!","June 3","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
