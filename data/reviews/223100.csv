First you as a consumer must know what you are buying. You are not buying a game that puts you in the position of being able to run through waves of enemies with a minigun. The game is trying to make you feel like you can't do that. So for all of you who are not very good at shooters and just like casually running through waves of enemies. Buy something else.\n\nIf you are a HUGE story buff and need plot twists, grand complexity, and touching moments mixed of course with the tad of romance. This is not your game.\n\nThis game is about the end of America and the resistance fighters who are trying to get it back. It is about being out numbered and knowing when to run. It is about exploring a beautiful world and doing some pretty awesome stuff along the way. Its not that innovative, but it still has its innovations and, for my computer, it works.\n\nPros\n- Excellent world\n- Graphics are beautiful\n- Solid game play and game mechanics (melee kills are great too)\n- Very cool attachment system\n- It is challenging\n- Story is not too bad\n- You do feel like a guerilla\n- Sometimes the AI actually is pretty decent (see below though)\n- There actually does seem to be quite a bit of attention to detail in the world\n- Coop is very fun, especially with the right people who want to do more than just rush to the objective\n- The coop maps are pretty cool\n- The customization in the coop definitely adds some replay ability\n- Though we will have to see how long it takes, they have promised 18 more free coop maps to be released over this year.\n\nCons\n- There are some occasional frame drops (but there are basically no loading screens, what do you expect?)\n- There are some glitches\n- The game does feel like it is lacking some polish that hopefully will come out in updates and patches very soon.\n- As with any open world game, there can be some repetition in side missions, but there is still diversity\n- The AI can be stupid at times.\n- The coop is short\n\nLet me say that I have officailly disowned IGN as a credible game review company. It certainly seems like the higher they are paid, the better the score and this game did not have the money to spare I guess. However, the real issues I have are with the people who have reviewed it and are not pro reviewers.\n\nI saw multiple 0 out of 10 reviews within the first 3 hours of the game being released and these were not people who had it before and they did not indicate such. They also did not complain about not being able to run it, but just talked about how much of a flop it was. GARBAGE. I highly doubt they even played the game at all.\n\nI am honestly amazed at the gaming community. It is like the vast majority are a bunch of bummed out, depressed athiests, who hate everything. There isn't a single game they call good except stupid indie games. Have you become so jaded that you can't enjoy games anymore? It appears so.\n\nSo shame on you gaming community. You have become a bunch of ungrateful whiners.\n\nI will update this review the more I play it.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nI have now completed the game and would like to say that I will give this game a 7.5 of 10. It simply was not polished enough to get an 8. Had the polishing work been done, then it would have been a solid 8. There are definitely some bugs, frame drops, second or two freezes all which do hamper the experience at times. Thankfully with my system, I have not had them too often. The storyline was so close to being solid, but again polish with a few more cinematic pauses in some of the cut scenes to take things in would have made it very sweet.\n\nAgain, polish is all this game is lacking. Aside from that I have had a blast with it. I have really enjoyed the coop and I am looking forward to more levels. I will definitely replay the single player game once the devs get it more stable. They have been working on it and seem to be very concerned about making this game work well. I would say, pick this game up on a sale and it will be totally worth it.","May 18","true","31.9"," 654 of 893 people (73%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","73","654","893","67","67"

Deepsilver ended up publishing the game and they have published decent titles in the past including the newest Saints Row and both games in the Metro series. Following this obvious poor pattern of development, it should already be a clear sign that the title probably won't be that good.\n\nPros: That being said the game itself is pretty bad. To start with the pros, I tried my best to understand what good came out of this game, but its really tough considering theres such a very very small amount of unique polish that no other game has. The idea of liberating apartments just reminds me of Far Cry 4, and the "Hearts and Minds" or morale meter of increasing the civillian morale is already stolen from other games, first that comes to mind is InFamous: Second Son. The gunplay is that of every other game except it does sort've have an interesting customization concept of swapping gun's slide and replacing it with totally different body. As mentioned in the short review, the graphics are decent, but they're really nothing to go home about, moderate as of 2016 although in a year's time they definitely will fall very short.\n\nCons: Now after slaying the pros I want to present the cons. For one thing, I am running a Nvidia GeForce GtX 980 FTW Edition, and I still found a lot of very poor optimization areas throughout my playthrough. Many stuttering issues that brought my FPS just because a cutscene began or a few enemies loaded on my screen. Next I want to touch on the story. In my opinion the concept seemed kind've cool and sort've unique. The execution of that said concept is very poor, the story is very cliche and predictable, Its also incredibly short, I  managed to beat it in 3 sit downs of about 3 hours. The gameplay in it is so repetitive and you just do the exact same things which include capturing small bases, finding an object and fighting KPA. After you end up beating this short but not very sweet game, you can't even return to it to complete extra side content or upgrade your weapons all the way, which punishes any player who decides to dedicate extra time towards doing the repetitive tasks. The overall production value in this game falls short of many games I've ever played. The animation is absolutely terrible. when jumping in real life I typically don't see my legs spaghetti everywhere even if I am quite thin. Also in cutscenes the major characters seem to just sink into the ground as if the KPA replaced all of America's ground with quicksand. The voice acting falls very short in the impressions that some VA's try to do. And it almost seems as if the highest produced portion of this game is the song that plays in the 35 minute long credits.\n\nOverall: The only time I'd recommend you to buy this game is to MAYBE play resistance mode with your friends, but under no circumstances should you spend $60 on it, I'd wait until a sale marks this price down to $10-$20, because thats the absolute MOST value you can get out of this title.","May 21","false","10.3"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","127","151","9","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/recommended/223100/","DeliveryGodNoah","DeliveryGodNoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/","363 products in account","Update 5/20- They released a patch today that is supposed to change how the game saves graphical settings, but other than that I did notice that the game does not stutter when the framerate drops below 60, and the devs have repeatedly acknowledged that many are having performance issues. It's a great sign for the future that the game will improve.\n\nGraphics- They look good, but it's also a Cryengine game, so it's hard to screw that up. Perhaps a bit rough on the eyes sometimes, however. General texture quality is acceptable, sometimes fantastic, and character models look generally detailed enough to please the majority of the graphically perceptive players. Shadows range from passable (general environmental shadows) to blobby messes (character shadows, small objects) and they do have some heavy impact on performance it would seem. Knocking them down from "Very High" to "High" gave me a pretty noticeable boost in performance.\n\nLighting in daytime looks really good, however fails to impress in any of the nighttime segments that I've played so far. The only time lighting sources that are not from the daytime look impressive is in smaller indoor areas where there's a lot of artificial lighting going on at once.\n\nThe world itself really does have a very nice amount of detail, and it really does feel like a real urban environment, at least so far. There are some woeful oversights however, such as ocean water not only being entirely flat, but also hardly even existant. Now I understand, maybe swimming plays absolutely zero role in this game, but for me to get a "leaving mission area" warning the second my feet touch the water, and to have my character literally walk on top of the water as if it was completely solid and then just suddenly fall into it when I "get too far out of the zone" seems really unpolished and a little lazy. At least use some stock Cryengine water or something.\n\nAnimations overall are average. I can't say I noticed anything too bad, but they don't standout either. They do flounder pretty signifigantly when there are a lot of NPCs in the same spot all trying to out manuever each other, and they glitch out and spaz as they continue to waltz in each other's way.\n\nGraphic options are pretty basic. If you've played a Crytek game before, it will look very familiar. Simple labels with simple settings. There is an FOV slider, but it doesn't go very far and it seems to be using Vertical FOV rather than "standard" horitzontal, so the label only goes up to 65, which using a conversion calculator says should equal about 95 horizontal FOV. Probably the largest offense with this however, is that not only does it not really look like the FOV is quite that high, but there are some serious clipping issues with the first person animations when set this way. I also have yet to find an open configuration file that lets you change this further, but I'm also not the most observant with the files.\n\nPerformance- Not too great. I'm running a 980ti and a 4770 CPU, and I am having trouble keeping it at 60, and when it drops, it stutters. It doesn't drop signifigantly however, generally only falling between 50-58 FPS, but it makes the game hiccup a bit (Vsync doesn't make a difference).\n\nAgain, turning the shadows setting down seemed to help a bit, but not enough to make it stable. I'm curious if it's a symptom of the game loading in assests as I'm moving around, as it does even out smoothly when I stay still or at least in the same small area of the map, but there are a few times where framerate drops regardless. The "Objects" setting also seems to help, but very minimally. I'll toy around with these settings further, but I'm not even that upset that the framerate drops, I'm more offended by the fact that the game stutters so badly when doing so, especially when it's only dropping by 5 frames at most.\n\nSound/Voice Acting- I'm a bit let down with this one, sadly. You can hear most things just fine, but the mixing does sound slightly off. A few voices do seem to be too quiet or drowned out, and environmental sounds seem passable at best. I also can barely recall the music (though again, I haven't played too much yet), and what I can remember seemed rather generic.\n\nVoice acting is also disappointing. I've certainly heard worse, dear god, have I heard worse, but I've heard way better. In the opening scenes, none of the voice actors caught my attention and truly tried to draw me into the experience. They just played the part and that was it. If I had to describe their performance, I'd say it sounds like most of them honestly have real talent, but not enough experience to truly deliver it. Other voices actors are pretty bad though, at least to me. Maybe I'm spoiled after playing a bit of Uncharted 4, but I don't feel engaged as a player with the voice acting.\n\nGameplay- This is where some things get pretty positive. For example, the gun customization. The first weapon you get is a standard pistol. However, you also are told to buy a conversion kit. This plays an interestingly detailed animation of the weapon being taken apart in your hands, and then put back together as a sub machine gun. I have no idea the realism of this mechanic, but it does look really, really cool, and I genuinely look forward to trying out other gun conversion mods later in the game.\n\nGuns that I've used so far also feel okay. Not amazing though. There is some recoil to them, and a little impact, but they could have been much better. What's interesting, is that you can steady your aim with every weapon as far as I can tell. You can of course aim traditionally down the sights and fire away, but the recoil (even with a mouse) will throw your aim off. However, holding shift while aiming will make it more steady and allow you to hit the target better. It's a neat addition to the gunplay I think, and makes it a little more challenging.\n\nControls feel very Crysis-like, if that makes sense, as in, they are a little weighty, and you can see your characters shadow and body when looking downward. You can walk up to some surfaces and mantle them, giving the game some slight verticality (which will likely be expanded upon later in the game, I imagine) and you move at a decent pace. There are vehicles in the game, or at least a motorcycle so far. On a keyboard, I didn't have any trouble controlling it. The mouse sensitivity shoots up when using it, but otherwise drives just fine, and it a rather fast way to get across the map. I haven't found out just how large the game's "open world" is yet, but it seems quite big, at least from my own perception.\n\nThere is a looting system, ostensibly leading to some more complex crafting, but so far I've only crafted molotovs.\n\nConclusion Should you buy Homefront: The Revolution today, right now? Perhaps not. Despite any praise I've given the game, honestly, nothing about the game as a whole feels very polished. It feels like it really need a few more months of development. And maybe patches will iron out the performance issues and tweak the gameplay for the better, but that's never an excuse.\n\nI know a few people crossed between buying this and the new DOOM, and if asked I would immedietely say get DOOM. I haven't personally played it yet, but I'm sure you've seen the great praise it's gotten from critics and players alike. Go get DOOM for now. Homefront will still be here later, hopefully in a more polished state. Get it on sale if possible.\n\nI really like the game's ideas and the atmosphere it's trying to go for. It does look really pretty, and has some neat mechanics, but nothing is fleshed out.","May 17","false","7.9"," 546 of 749 people (73%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","73","546","749","33","59"

I reluctantly started playing it after a long days work expecting to be disappointed by another crappy AAA title, and then you know what happened next? I sat in disbelief and confusion in what in the actual hell everyone was complaining about! I have an amd 8350 cpu and a GTX 760 (not massively high end) and I play this game on all high settings with NO PERFORMANCE ISSUES AT ALL like seriously, I can't say I understand how people with I7's and 980s are having performance problems when I can run at high with a steady 60fps no problem.\n\nI havent encountered a single bug and the game plays exactly as I wished it would, open world style fps with a challenge, I would say this game is almost like a combination between farcry & Mercinaries 2, it has the rpg aspects that everyone expected with the epic gun customization and crafting, and keeps to the promise of guerilla warfare over run and gun tactics.\n\nI find it ironic that I followed the division for 3 years only to play it for less hours than I've already put into this game which I only knew about a few weeks before launch. The story so far is amazing, some parts funny some parts really dark (pretty much exactly what I expected from a sequel to the original storyline)  but in all seriousness I can't put my finger on why people hate this game so much, its like people are just aching for the next game to blame and follow the band wagon.\n\nHopefully the reviews dont stay the way that they are because if so then I know a lot of people are going to be holding back on this purchase which is a real shame since it's actually quite solid of a title.\n\nAll things considered I could give this game a solid 7.5 personally, mainly because the voice acting is pretty poor, but the gameplay and story more than make up for some interlapping lines and such.\n\nEDIT: So I havent beaten the story yet, but I have dabbled in the multiplayer to see what they have going on there since it was a pretty big part of the game. Firstly to anybody whos wondering, there's no competitive multiplayer, all of the focus was put into the coop which I personally prefer. The characters customization is pretty varied, male and female characters and a crap ton of gear that you unlock using currency and exp from playing in coop matches. roughly 25 or so items for each part of the body, head, arms, legs etc. and then a wide variety of skills that don't make any appearance in the single player portion of the game. It has a very similar feel to the single player, for example if one player decides to be loud and proud it doesn't mean that you have to be as well, you can remain silent and unseen by the enemy even if they are blasting their converted LMG into the heavens. Speaking of which the gun customization is all the same in the multiplayer but the system implemented makes it take far longer to unlock all of the guns, conversions, gear etc. because you unlock them via crates and don't directly choose what you want to unlock (although you can choose categories to unlock like attachements, vanity, weapons and such, but you just cant choose precisely what you want)\n\nAll in all im happy with the multiplayer, very good if playing with friends since you truly do need to rely on your allies to win since the game can be unforgivingly difficult, but that's not to say that randoms are no good, but obviously with no in game voice chat it's nice to have people you can talk to directly via TS or other means. Anyways with that being said I can confidently give the game a solid 8 now for very nice and replayable multiplayer.","May 18","true","25.1"," 222 of 331 people (67%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","67","222","331","22","12"

Only 2 characters throughout this entire game were above the level of "bareable". Jack is the buddy/dudebro of the game, the guy that cracks jokes, kicks ♥♥♥, and is just fun to be around. Dana is batshit, but the good kind, the kind that makes the inner psychopath in you say "I would totally do that!". The rest are outright boring and flat, and when characters die you don't feel anything for them\n\n2. The setting: Dambusters recreation of Philadelphia feels alive, and is bursting with personality. You actually feel as if there was a huge war, and that the KPA is a formidable force to be reckoned with, although I found the minimal refrences to historical monuments/figures odd for a city full chocked full of them\n\n3. Alternate future: Since this game is based in an alternate future, it is plausible that the North Koreans were able to take over America, unlike the first game\n\nCons\n1. The story: convoluted and uninteresting. It isn't easy to follow, nor do you feel very invested in it\n2. The gameplay: combat is extremely clunky, (you get used to it over time), and because of this, it makes slogging through the games campaign all the more painful\n3. Braindead AI: The AI is extremely stupid, the only way you get killed by them is if they swarm you, and this happens more often than not\n4. Stealth is a no go: Killing a KPA soldier, even with a silencer, sends off an imediate alert that, instead of making nearby soldiers investigate your position, instantly spawns in enemies that start drilling you with bullets. Stealth is essentialy a terrible tactic, and the whole system needs an overhaul\n5. Rinse and repeat objectives: So essentially to finish the story, you need to capture different points within the hub worlds, which then unlock the next mission in the story. The problem with this is, that is literally what you do for the entire game. It boils down to: Go here, clear and capture all of these points, then do the story mission(s), repeat. This gets extremely repetitive, and even borderline annoying, coupled with the fact that the gunplay is terrible makes it all the more dreadfull\n6. Bugs galore. Whether it be floating pedestrians, stuttering or un-capturable points, this game is filled with a ridiculous amount of bugs that will end up frustrating you to the point where you don't want to play the game anymore\n7. Phantom "Open-world". This games is NOT open world, like Fry Cry is open world. It is filled with "hub worlds". Think Dragon Age Inqusition type hub worlds.\n8.Brady do this, Brady do that. BRADY, BRADY!: The games characters rely on you WAY too much, making you feel like you are the de-facto leader, and/or errand boy, when you are just another soldier fighting with the resistance. I get that you are playing the protagonist, but the game doesn't present you as anyone special, just another soldier, so another resistance fighter could easily do what you do\n9. Resorting to Call Of Duty tactics: The game tries its best to paint your charatcer as a guriella fighter, and in the beginning of the game it does that. You will have low ammo, low health, and have to scavenge to craft items like molotovs or RC bombs that give you an edge. But by mid-game, you will have upgraded your character enough to where all of that gets tossed out the window, and you can essentially go rambo and just run in and gun soldiers down. Yes, you could "role-play" as a guriella fighter, but the annoying AI doesn't/won't make you want to\n10. Same-y enemies: It's essential the same enemy type over and over with no variation, and this really emphasizes that feeling of boredom you will eventually get\n11. Moral argument: This one is personal, but I found the moral arguemnt discussed by a ceratin character in the game to be extremely annoying. His argument is basically "see, this is what happens when you cause trouble!" I'm sorry, I didin't realize that a revolution was going to be PEACEFUL, when we are stock pilling weapons, ammo and materials for a godamn war. "People get hurt" Well no duh, it's a freaking war for freedom, don't like it? Shouldn't have signed up in the first place.\n12. Phantom "Customization". The "on the fly" gun customization intially shown for this game is a ruse. There are few weapons to choose from, your setup will most likely end up being an SMG, Assault Rifle, and an RPG. There are few upgrades/attatchments that make each weapon feel unique, although there are some interesting conversions, maybe 2 or 3, but you will always end up switching back to the setup stated above\n13. Compensation for braindead AI will make some missions difficult: In certain missions, the game will spawn endless hordes of enemies to compensate for their lack of good scripting/coding, and more often than not this makes missions a pain, especially missions where you need to defend something, or you have resistance fighting with you and they get mowed down\n14. Poor character animation and lip sync: The characters animations are absolutely atrocious, espesially for a game released in 2016. Mass effect, yes the original, has better animations than this\n15. Game breaking bugs: I haven't experienced this, but I know some people who have run into a bug during a certain mission that does not allow them to progress at all, making the game basically unplayable, besides co-op\n16. Side missions: A complete waste of time, and unrewarding\n17. Graphics: Graphics are generally good (that's cry engine for you) but some low res textures are pretty noticable\n\nThings not mentioned:\nMultiplayer: didn't bother to try it, didn't feel like it would justify a 60$ asking price\nSeason pass: not sure what they will include, but I know some people enjoy this game, so I won't tell you not to buy it\n\nFinal verdict: 2/10\nPurchase recommendation: Do not pruchase, at all, not even on sale\n\nI really wanted to like Homefront: The Revolution, I was part of the minority who didn't write off the game, and wanted to give it a chance, but sadly, that didn't happen. This game would have honestly done better as a linear shooter, because the main missions were easily the best part of the game. Sad to say, but in terms of overall game design, the original Homefront was leagues better than this game. Say what you will, but the original had better writing, an interesting story, great characters, great mechanics/gunplay, and included a Battlefield/CoD like, PvP centered multiplayer that gave it longevity and spawned a cult following. Dambuster essentially butchered that, and I fear this is the end of the Homefront "franchise" (if it was ever one) and should be laid to rest","May 26","false","13.4"," 53 of 67 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","53","67","4","4"

Even the 'Sponge' enemies are only there to soak up bullets and cause just  bit more damage.\n\nEven though you cant use enemy weapons, enemy soldiers were kind enough to stock up on bullets for my guns when i eventually loot their corpses.\n\nHowever, what you might hear in other reviews is that the atmosphere of the game is great, really gives you a sense of dread and despair but that soon washes away from the awkward voice acting and pitiful resistance enemy soldiers put up.\n\nThe game at times looks great especially when its raining during the night, it does look amazing but there often texture glitches and pop in effects with draw distance.\n\n\nThe on the fly weapon customisation is really cool but soon you find is surprisingly limited and you'll quickly being to rely on two weapons outside of the fun and gimmicky ones such as the shotgun that fires napalm or the 'freedom launcher'.\n\nAll and all an average game that isn’t crap but not spectacular either.\n\nI only wish there was more to the game except go hear find x amount of things to unlock more things ad nauseam","May 19","false","9.6"," 111 of 165 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","111","165","4","0"

Sorry for clear and honest words. It has potential. It theoretically is fun if you like the formula of Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4. But there are a few heavy down-sides that kill the fun:\n\n- Performance: As soon as I left the tutorial area, the performance went down. I usually get between constant 60 down to 40 fps. But as soon as this game hits 55 fps or less, it feels as if it goes down to 15. I tried all the settings in different combinations, playing on 1080p and 720p and I can't get this game to run smoothly on my rig (i7 4790k @ 4.4GHz, 16gb RAM, GTX 980, Win10 Pro x64).\n\n- AI: Dumb as hell, they are running into my gunfire. 30 minutes of shooting, 200 killed enemies of which like 25-30 corpses stack up on one single pile within a doorframe and I knew: The AI is sadly broken. Buying a silencer and silenced boots at the beginning seem to be somewhat overpowered and allowed me to gun down a whole platoon within the very first hour of the game.\n\n- Spawnpoints of enemies and mini-events: They spawn randomly. Everywhere. Even within a 15-meter-circle, I was able to run in circles between 3 mini-events to fulfil my "get 100% of trust"-mission within 5 minutes. Also friends and foes tend to spawn right next to each other when war is going on. And after 30 minutes of defending a house, one enemy spawned right behind me within that hermetically sealed house as soon as I stepped out of the doorframe. That wasn't a pleasure.\n\nIn general, these issues aren't things that would make me say "DAYUM, 'DIS GAME'S BROKEN, DUDE!" - but these 3 issues are the main reason why I couldn't truly enjoy my first 2 hours of this game. I'm diving into it a bit more and hope that there will soon be a bunch of bugfixes and patches. But for now, I simply can't recommend this game in it's current shape. The potential is there, but now is the time the devs have to show whether they're willing to use it or not.","May 20","false","13.7"," 84 of 124 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","84","124","2","4"

This game is so broken that it won't let you make any progress on the Power To The People mission, completely stalling game progress. Sometimes publishers will push a game to be release too early and put way too much pressure on the developer. That certainly seems to be the case here.\n- Pressing or spamming *Enter* will sometimes not skip logos upon startup despite displayed message stating to do so.\n- Game blackscreened with continuing audio, after opening cinematic on first try.\n- Awkward and dysfunctional parkour. Dambuster Studios could take some lessons from Assassin's Creed.\n- Bad AI. NPCs have a habit of trapping you in a corner or blocking a doorway.\n- Can't do the Car Park Chop Shop mission due to a bug with the motorcycle dyno which results in the rollerdoor not opening.\n- Gameplay completely stalls on the Power To The People mission, meaning that you can make no further progress in the game. Only option is to restart from the beginning with a random chance that it may happen again.\n- Light outside of doorways is too blinding and washed out to see a KPA target shooting at you.\n- NPCs clip through each other, the ground, and other objects.\n- NPCs will come and stand in front of you just as you pull the trigger on your RPG resulting in their death and possibly your own.\n- NPCs in your squad act like they're on an invisible bungie cord and will stand so close to you that they can push you off a ledge.\n- No news on when a patch will be released.\n\n(Developer wants to expand the game in the future so I'm hopeful that these issues will be resolved. However if you buy it prior to it getting patched then there is every chance you will be forced to delete your save and start over.

Not in the gameplay, but in the basic aspect of it. I loved the play style i chose, it was OP, but allowed for a challenge when i wanted it. I was a super fast stealth monster whose primary weapon was a knife and a crossbow. Many people complain about the stealth mechanic in the game being ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and i can agree a bit. If you are caught, everyone know where you are, but, considering its a super advanced army with self driving tanks, I would not be surprised. There were more stealth options than people think, including if you kill an enemy quick enough, they can't call reinforcements. Made use of that real well.\n\nBut....\n\nThere is one thing i hated, absolutely hated. It was so bad that I have to give the game a thumbs down. The story, As you started feeling emersed in the game, the story comes by and tears you away like a bandaid held on with super glue. like, WTF happened to the original mission!\nYour original mission is to find some dude who was a huge asset to the resistance. Halfway through the story, you forget he exists and you never hear from him again.\nAnd the ending was so anti climactic and made no sense. spoilers ahead.\nYou are so OP that you end up going through the final mission barely getting damage, then out of nowhere, without any context as how it happened, you are on your death bed, limping at 0.2 MPH and only have a pistol. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is my SMG, my battle rifle, my mine launcher. did they just disappear?!? And WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THE ♥♥♥♥♥ COMMIT SUICIDE I COULD HAVE TAKEN OUT THE GOLIATH WITH 2 ♥♥♥♥ING MINES!\nI can't understand it. While playing the game you are a god who runs up to enemies and stabs the ♥♥♥♥ out of them while blasting heads off with ease. then all of a sudden you are stopped by a grunt who somehow sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face.\n\nHere is another problem. People mix up open world and sandbox. Open world means you have access to the entire world, but it can still be controlled by the story. Sandbox means no rules. Fallout 4 is a good example. You dont even need to do the missions, you can go and destroy the entire wasteland right out of the vault.\n\nOn the topic of open. The story is linear as ♥♥♥♥. You have no control as to what happens. The only time you have the option to choose is when you decide to either kill, or spare a double agent. and you know what, your decision DOES JACK ♥♥♥♥! IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING!!! HELL YOU ARENT EVEN SENT AN EMAIL OR TEXT SAYING YOU SHOULDA LEFT HIM ALIVE OR KILL HIM! LIKE NO INTERACTION TO THE DECISION AT ALL! If you are going to give the option to choose, that option HAD BETTER HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT!\n\nAt this current point in time, don't waste your money on the game. If there is an update or even a DLC that fixes these issues and helps close holes in the story, then it may be worth the buy.","May 25","false","17.6"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","37","49","0","2"

My first walk around the neighbourhood was slow... the textures look great, the environment is wonderfully detailed with many unique objects around to complete the immersive experience making the environment feel busy and alive. The main characters so far are all unique and have different personalities... the ambient NPCs are cool too however there is an issue with the rigging as their necks look like they are possessed by a demon... There is also an issue with the NPCs interaction with their environment and other NPCs as I seen 2 of them walking into eachother and continued walking on the spot.\n\nSounds used in the game are excellent however the fades/crossovers need work, as sounds are often clashing with one another, overpowering or even turning off other sounds altogether. Now I'm not like these other morons out there that say a game has optimization issues because they aren't getting 120FPS, we all know anything over 35 is excellent for gameplay... however this game does have optimization issues, but it's due to the environment being so detailed and RAM consuming... but it does need work because as soon as i got into battle, I couldn't play it... let alone ride a motorbike at full speed... it ruined it for me... I'm yet to turn all my settings to LOW and see how it goes... FYI I'm running Alienware with GTX680 and 32GB RAM... I play the division on mostly high with a couple ultra settings with no slowdown...\n\nPlayer movement feels very stiff like me on a Saturday morning, interaction with objects and climbable areas sometimes takes a few times to register...\n\nThe weapon custimization options are exactly the same as Crisis which I dont mind at all as it's a cool looking system... The graphics are beautiful the plot is excellent and I'm really liking where this is going, as I haven't played a good UPRISING styled game since half Life 2... but right now, where it is... I CANNOT give it a thumbs up... in fact I am very disappointed I purchased this as in Australia, this game costed me $70 AUD but I'm not sure if I want to refund or not... I'm holding the hope that this game will be rescued...\n\nI was a big fan of the first Homefront when noone else even liked it, because it was too linear and short... but it was a good game... I will update this review after a few bug fixes, but right now I just cant play it...\n\nIN FUTURE DEVELOPERS... BE SURE TO QUALITY ASSURE YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE YOU SELL IT...

AI Bugs, Wall Bugs, Graphic Bugs, and GAMEBREAKING BUGS!\n\nI was ok to keep the game and play it through even with the bugs until I ran into GAMEBREAKING BUGS over and over again. 4 times I ran into these bugs. I reported them, I also reported how to recreate them. As of 5/22/16 they are not fixed. I am not a play tester for this game, but I assure you it needed some. These bugs were easily found and recreated.\n\nNow how are these bugs Gamebreaking? Basically, it puts you in a mission that can neither be completed or end. Often area becomes a ghost town because AI won't spawn properly, or they get stuck in walls. Your objective will be to do X, but you have already completed X so you can't do it. Quest/Mission Flag fails to realize you have already done request. You are just stuck in same area, with no way to proceed in the game. Does not reward exploring because you might bug your game if you explore something too early.\n\nThats ok, I can just go to a previous save right. NO... by the time you figure out you have put yourself in a never ending bug. Its too late. There are no save states. Game autosaves and autosaves often. You have a total of 4 autosaves. These autosaves happen whenever you do something significant or if you change your weapon at a locker. Basically, you can't rely on savestates to return to if you bug the game.\n\nTheir solution if you get bugged and cannot proceed.\n1. Wait for patch to fix bug.\n2. Erase your saves, and start over.\n\nI started over 4 times, and found different Gamebreaking bugs each time. The only way to avoid these bugs is to not explore and only follow mission requests. Makes game boring and not fun at all.\n","May 22","false","25.8"," 38 of 56 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","38","56","0","1"

The game was still hours and hours of fun but it almost feels like they rushed the plot to ship the game in time.  It was probably the most un-interesting, short-sighted, predictable ending of any video game, ever.\n\nAlso I found something that really helped performance big time about half-way through.  Put the object detail at medium.  I could hardly tell any difference between medium and very high, and I was able to max everything else out and play with a pretty much locked 60fps @ 2715x1527 which looks considerably better than 1080p.  And oddly runs much better than 1.5x supersampling in-game.\n\nGood try Dambuster - hopefully you'll have some great lessons learned from all of the user feedback and will make a truly great game if there's a sequel.\n\n\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI waited 10 hours to post my review because I wanted to give HF:R a fighting chance.\n\nShort version:\n\n7/10 - I say buy it\nPros:  Actually pretty damn fun so far\nCons:  GPU utilization/frame pacing issues reminiscent of Fallout 4\n\nLong version:\n\nMaybe my version of a fun FPS is different from 99% of the world, but I'm actually really enjoying this game.  Considering DeepSilver/DB inherited a POS bankrupt title that was tossed back and forth for 4 years like a red-headed high school cheerleader, I think the results are pretty great.\n\nSure, there are some framepacing issues, GPU utilization problems, and yes theres some points where it's sort of mindboggling that basic features arent there (hello...cough... save game), but the overall presentation is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good and enjoyment is high.  Maybe I'm weird... but  I was compelled to write a review in favor of this game after seeing so many bad reviews before playing it.\n\nAll I've seen are reviews saying how disasterous the performance is.  I also see the majority of reviews saying the gameplay is bland, combat is weak, stealth system sucks, graphics are underwhelming, on and on and on.  I disagree with those for the most part too. I swear people are way too critical.  Here's my take:\n\nStealth:  7/10 - If it had better cover mechanics, or even the ability to lean from cover, it would be 8\nCombat: 7/10 - it does feel a little sluggish at times, but I turned auto-aim off\nGraphics: 6/10 - compared to Division or UC4, which have set a new bar for graphics these days\nEnjoyment 8/10 - despite the lower scores above, for some reason this game is totally pulling me in, its fun!\nPerformance: 5/10 - see below\nStory: 5/10\nValue: 7/10\n\nThe only real major flaw I see so far is a GPU utilization problem.  A 6700k/980ti combo should be able to run a Dying Light clone (essentially what this game feels and looks like to me) at a resolution of 2715x1527 @ max settings and achieve a locked 60fps with about 90-95% GPU utilization.  With HF:R it's nowhere even close to that.  I'm able to get 55-60 fps @ 1920x1080 but it only uses about ~65% of the GPU to do so.\n\nIf I step it even 1 notch above 1080p, or use supersampling at all, framerates become wildly unstable - as does the GPU utilization.  Even at 1080p there are a few very rare and unexplainable dips into the high 40s.  Every time it happens the GPU util actually drops to around 30-50%, almost as if something's choking the bandwidth.  Actually, it's a similar symptom to  Fallout 4.  Even with the necessary hardware to run it at 2k DSR max settings, the game just couldn't keep up with the draw calls - showing the signs of an aging engine I suppose.\n\nBut to note: the frame rate issue (for me anyway) is very infrequent ... maybe 3-4 times in the 10 hours I've played.  I think it's a minor nuisance.  The rest of the time it's a pretty stable 60fps using ~65% GPU at max settings.  Good enough to be enjoyable.\n\nAnyway - I don't understand what's with all the hate.  It's a fun game and a killer concept with only minor performance issues.  If they fix the framerate issues I'd even go so far as to give it a 7.5 out of 10.  If you're on the fence but enjoyed Dying Light, I'd say buy it.  You'll probably enjoy this game.  It's kind of like a mix of DL and Division... sorta.  Maybe wait until it goes on sale, which with the number of negative reviews sadly, probably won't take very long.\n\nSpecs:\n\nI6700k\nGigabyte G1 980ti\n64gb Dominator Pro DDR4\n950 Evo NVME\nAsus Hero Viii","May 17","true","38.0"," 131 of 222 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","131","222","8","10"

Let's be warned you'll die a lot . Truth be told I'm not the best FPS gamer around, but I played on normal and I died countless times ( not as much as in Dark Souls though)\n+ the motorcycle: driving that motorcycle through town feels very realistic\n+ plays very smooth ( GTX 750ti ) with ZERO frame drops\n\nCon\n\n- Enemy AI : At times you can just walk past them and they won't really bother to do anything and at other times they will "sense" you killed one of their own even if you killed them with no-one in sight and with the knife. Which will make them automatically go into alert mode.\n- Graphic glitches  : e.g. Fellow rebels which obviously should be carrying a gun, but in reality there are just moving their empty hand with the trigger finger in the position of holding a gun. Enemies vanishing, citizens running into walls, enemies being able to see you through walls and hit you with a gun sometimes, ...\n- at times Tedious side missions : collect this, donate some cash to beggars, pull that lever in the enemy base, hacking terminals , still there are some big games out there that did worse.\n- Story sometimes a little cliche ( won't spoil it)\n\nI enjoyed playing the game because I enjoyed the setting and the combat system, although it felt unfair at times, with the enemies being able to hit me through walls and stuff. It feels and plays a little like a mix of METRO and Watch Dogs.\nMUST BUY ? Hm depends on you, maybe you should be waiting until there are a few more patches released.\n\nHonestly I don't think it deserves the mixed reviews it got. It's not bad. It's fun. Also I was talking with a friend and it seems that gamers who are using AMD graphical cards are the ones to experience performance problems mainly. So maybe if you are owning AMD, you should buy it on STEAM directly so you'll be able to return it in case it won't work\n\n","May 25","true","20.6"," 47 of 74 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","47","74","2","1"

About 10 minutes into the game, a civilian made me stuck between two doors causing me to glitch onto the roof then fall out of the map.\n- There is no clear effect for when you take damage. It looks like you are barely damaged and then you fall dead.\n- Enemies can run into the respawn area making you die repeatedly.\n- Enemies are in no way scaled to teach you the ropes. You will right off the bat be swarmed with enemies and APCs.\n- Speaking of which. If you see an APC and then go around the corner to bomb it. When you turn back, it is gone. Just poff. Very weird despawning. Even had a robot teleport from one side to another.\n\nNow that is just the game design and some common sense rules that they break.\n\nAside from that, the game just doesn't feel responsive and they have some really ethically questionable stuff like teddy bears functioning as proximity mines. Because as wel know, toy bombs are weapons aimed at children, not soldiers. That's like a basic "don't do it" of content design. It's not funny to joke about murdering children.\n\nAt its current state, I can only recommend it to people who just want something to play while waiting on other games.

Due to my short play-time, I am not finding it repetitive as of yet, though as mentioned...that could change.\n2. The missions seem ok, and I don't have too much to complain about regarding them yet.\n3. The voice acting is not bad, or good, and I would say it is fair to o.k., and does not cause me any ill thoughts so far.\n4. The weapon customization seems good, and I enjoy that sort of option in my games. To me, that adds a "pro" by itself.\n5. Controls don't seme "clunky" to me. I had no issues wiht Keyboard/Mouse. I also had logical, and intuitive controls immediately when deciding to use my XBOX One controller as my control choice.\n6. Due to the game being "new," I would say that it is expected, of a bigger title such as this, and the company producing such, that there will be patches, dlc, addons, tweaking, fixes, and etc.\n\nSummation:\n1. Game could become repetitive/boring eventually.\n2. Multiplayer/Co-op needs more content, and options.\n3. Game is fun at this time for me, and for a singleplayer game, I can't say "don't buy it," though i'd caution you to perhaps wait a bit.\n4. A.I. is appallingly stupid. By stupid, I mean, after detecting you through walls, they often stand on the other side of the walls, and literally expend magazine after magazine into their side of the wall.\n5.

The story is very lackluster with no real sense of making a diffrence to the people who inhabit the game world, there is zero emotion to be felt with Homefront the Revolution which is a shame as again another AAA game chooses a real possible scenario as the backdrop to there game but it carries no weight in terms of emotion or caring for the person (character) next to you. The story or main campaign is easily one of the most forgettable stories i have played the only thing i remember is getting frustrated with the hearts and minds parts of the game which is very tedious and repetitive. Combat in Homefront the Revolution is very unsatisfying the game is an FPS game but has none of the fundementals of an FPS game FoV is limited to 65 i would like at the very least 90 there is no dual sensitivity for hipfire and aimed fire. There is a few bugs in the game and a lot of cut corners. You cant even freeroam after the main story is complete so if you missed things in the game like side quests you have to start the game again.\n\nThere is a co-op section in the game which was fun for a little bit but what i dont understand is why for a couple of  co-op missions there is so much in terms of character customization and weapons when there is no multiplayer, there is certain attachments for weapons like the suppresor for your assault rifle which you can only use on your assault rifle in co-op mode and not in the main game.\n\nThere is a lot of cons with this game and not enough pros to justify giving it a positive review which is unfortunate as it could of been such a great game that i could of been quite happy to sink alot of hours into but after 14 hours the main story is complete and so are the co-op missions and there is no desire to go back and play it again so as it stands its an over priced ballon that quickly deflates and i wouldnt recommend this game and would suggest either waiting for a sale or investing in another game. So sadly its a thumbs down for this one.","May 21","false","16.4"," 33 of 53 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","33","53","2","0"

Seriously. It's a full-priced FPS which has innate Mouse Acceleration, FOV cap at 65, no options for toggling ADS...\n\nAnd it literally just plays like Call of Duty with a ♥♥♥♥♥ier plot. At the very least, the Modern Warfare games felt like playing through some bombastic Michael Bay flick, this game feels like I'm playing through a film that Zack Snyder directed after he got stoned, played Half Life 2, watched Red Dawn, and decided: 'hey, i can make something like this'. The plot is stupidly over the top -- and the worst part is that it takes itself way too seriously to the point of pretension.\n\nGuys, Doom is out. The New Wolfenstein's been out.

It is very unoptimized but once I got the game running to the point where I could play it I was enjoying my time. It was at about the five hour mark where I started noticing how repetitive the game can get. I also ran into glitches where AI that were driving vehicles would get stuck and I would have to load my last checkpoint. That's not too big of a deal but it is annoying when you're near the end of the game trying to power through it and this happens. I like the setting for the game but it was not executed properly. Nothing I did seemed to have a lasting affect. I never got emotionally attached to the characters which is necessary (in my opinion) to make a great game. I feel like once they fix the optimization issues and the glitches that this would be a great game to pickup on sale.\n\nI did enjoy parts of the game. The open world is a nice touch and the weapon customization is a cool concept. I like that they added a dirt bike. I think it's perfect for getting around the map quickly.","May 22","false","9.9"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

Capturing different areas, and building the resistance was fun for me. The weapon customization was kind of cool. RC Car grenade/Hack tool was a fun idea.\n\nCons:\nTHE BUGS! This Game was horribly optimized and buggy. I have a high end computer i7-5820K, 16Gb DDR4, and a GTX 970. Playing on a Med-High Settings it would lag out at parts dropping down to 10 FPS.\nThe game wasn\'t even finished, some of the safe houses glitched out and I literally had to look up work arounds to get into a safe house because the doors were glitched shut. (Ashegate Propaganda Depot)\nMultiple times I got stuck in areas that I couldn\'t get out of and had to restart the game.\nWhen you customized the weapons it wouldn\'t save the configuration half the time.\nThe developers got very lazy with the GTK equipment; they all had the exact same upgrades for each device and you really only used 1 or 2.\nMy biggest complaint: On one of the last missions, you need to escort 2 trucks to different spots so you can shoot down some blimps. The truck was trying to path through a building!!! Eventually out of frustration I used explosives and got it unstuck, At which point it tried to drive through a broken car blocking the road. When I got close to it, It said I was out of the mission area.\n\nConclusion:\nI spent 18 hours on this game, and had an OK time doing it. But I couldn’t even finish this game if I wanted to.

This game is at best a 15€ game in my opinion. I expected it to be a great mix of known games like Division (Haven't played), Metro (10/10), latest Far Cries (Man of the people, fighting the revolution etc.). I bought the game solely because of seeing how the graphics were and what the theme was. Sadly I have to say, this game's story is a major lackluster.\nIn terms of mechanics, imagine the Devs are sitting in their kitchen, they have this Pot full of boiling water that has "Mechanics" written on it. It is meant to be the Mechanics soup. What they did there, they decided that peeling the ingredients for this soup, would be a waste of time and simply took them raw as they were and threw them in the pot, expecting their soup to taste the same. Little to their knowledge, soup tastes like garbage now and they totally should've spent more time on each ingredient. Stealth mechanic is below basic, Weapon customization is half-done(you're gonna reach end-game gear really quick and you won't have to grind for it, in fact you will have too much cash left over sitting there doing nothing useful for you), Core gameplay lies in the amount of bullets you put into your enemy and where you shoot. Its as simple as that. The mechanics of this game are nothing special, and some are even worse than any of their competitors not just by a little bit but by a lot.\nExpect this game to be short-lived in your library. The whole story took me as much as I will ever play it. No, I did not complete every single objective, Cause simply these objectives had literally 0 use, but yes I did complete a major part of them like 50%. You can rush through the main story-line brainlessly and you're not going to miss out on anything, mainly because side-quests are nothing more but eye-candy.\nCharacter development sucks, although I'm not really criticizing that aspect in the games enough to explain it well enough.

I must admit, this game will not win game of the year. However. Homefront: The Revolution is not a bad game. It's not great, but it isnt bad. Probably because of all the problems this game had, this game could have been more. There are good fun features in this game, but they are poorly executed. Story is "okay", but not interesting. I loved the first Homefront, but this one...doesn't go much in the background or story. It feels like doing a shore. Liberating area's seems fun for the first two area's, afterwards it seems pretty much the same thing. It seems like some things were simplified, and that seemed like it was just for "speeding up" the proces. It's not a good game, but it's not a bad one either. I do like the voice actors, and they do try their best to create a homefront world. But it just doesn't feel right. I want to say this game was worth it, but it just doesn't feel so. Great sound effects, great music. The gameplay is "okay", story was dissapointing, but it wasn't "bad". I love the game, but it missed a lot of greatness. I rate this game a 6/10. But i can not recommend this game at full price. Wait for a sale, and then maybe sure.","June 2","false","21.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

The lack of multiplayer base for this game literally within the first week of release tells me that this game will end up just like starwars battlefront. Flopped... an example is today.. sunday at 5 pm eastern.. i went looking for games and didnt find a single 1.. tells ya something about the future state of this game in general. story is ok but nothing to speak of. truthfully listening to the leaders of the resistance give talks to the resistance in single player was really eh. didnt feel really all that hardcore to resist haha.. some would say the story itself is short.. maybe not as short as the first game.. but short enough that i hammered threw it in a few hours.. so truthfully i went in really wanting to love this game and deep silver pre-released it to early.. really half did everything in the game.. and truthfully the hype everyone sees when watching the trailer.. the game didnt live up to. its a shame really as iv invested to many hours to request a refund and am stuck with the game. on the plus.. i wont have to spend any more money on dlcs/expensions as deepsilver kinda lost my business. really liked the company till now and always supported their games. shame but oh well..  sorry for any errors as i am writing this really quick before heading out the door. my advice is if you aint sure , give it a go as you may enjoy it but i personally wasnt impressed. games worth maybe 30 bucks at best at its current state. and truely feel it needs a way better story line.. but to each their own.","May 22","false","30.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It just doesn't add up to what you would hope in anyway. Mechanics are all pretty good, customization all pretty good, story, the same. It's all professional, but it lacks. Especially bummed about the multiplayer. It's fun, but repetitive. Randoms always just rush the mission, and the missions feel like they are meant to be so that's ok, but they are too short and are really just run and shoot. There's some bugs with the guns too that I am sure will be patched but it's just another thing. The mechanics are good tho, it's like far cry and l4d and cod and crysis and idk... cover system is cool, melee os cool, guns are cool... but just in general, it's not deep enough when it comes to level design. Again, story seems well done, but I just don't care about it. I really wanted a good shooter with stealth mechanics that had a great coop mode.

I tried not to listen to the talk about it being bad, but 6 hours in, I find myself whining outloud to myself as I play "uugggh It's sooo ♥♥♥♥ing buggyy!!!!"\nExample... There's a part where you need to run to defend an area, and your rebel fighters are running down a corridor with you, at the end of a corridor is an open door to the next area. You can't run through the door because it's a loading point where you need to press E to load the next zone, but the NPCs are running through the door, pushing you out of the way so you can't get into the half-inch wide area to press E and you're stuck getting hipchecked over and over until eventually you button mash your way into the loading screen.\n\nOn top of that, the mission structure is weird, it's like they thought "What are some popular games?" and tried to mix farcry with assassin's creed for the "open world" gameplay, the instructions are often unclear (to me at least) and I don't even know why I need 3 different currencies for things...

Open world like Fallout series to be able to go anywhere and do what you want to do, well you can in this game but that means in a couple of city blocks.  Not only that but the game does not feel like its in Philly. It does not feel like in any American city.\n\nPros:\nThe idea of the game\nCons:\nEverything about this game\nFrame Rates on High end machines are the same for E machines\nGraphics dated and muted (not in a good way)\nLag in single player\nLack of making your Person unique\nPoor AI on both sides allies are stupid and stand out in middle of the street (no way to give orders to them either)\nKPA will walk into ambushes, they have a vehicle that will sit and allow you to throw grenades at it.\nMolitove Cocktails that do not damage vehicles but only Infantry.  Apparently they never read why Moltoves were used and where they were successful i.e. against tanks and armor, vehicles, not that great on Infantry as people move away from a flaming bottle.\n\nSo if you buy this game due so when its on sale for 10 bucks and you and some friends can play together for an hour or so, or on a drinking night.","May 22","false","13.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have read the reviews from others and other major sites. I can honestly say the only negative thing I can personally find in this game is optimization.\n\nGameplay and graphics were spot on in my opinion and even though I set my expectations low because I didn't expect it to even release after waiting so long with no news. I am extremely appreciated of the fact they brought everything I honestly expected in the game. Story is pretty good so far and I have no complaints and the gameplay and the feel of the game is very good.\n\nOptimization as I mention is the only downside of this. I did update to the latest drivers in hopes for SLI to work with this game since it was provided in the latest drivers by Nvidia, but it seems SLI does not work for this game. So I am only able to get on high settings across the board (nearly maxed settings, but not quite there) and I achieve a stable framerate around 90 FPS constantly through my playthrough of the game. Of course when I attempted max settings the frames were so unstable and plummeted to nothingness when it is maxed out. This would be the only downside, but the game only just released so I am not going to gripe about it because of that and will wait and see for future updates.\n\nAs for other negative reviews and the reviews from IGN, etc. I honestly would suggest others to take it with a grain of salt. I would honestly give this game an easy 8.5 for the quality gameplay, story and experience this game has given. Which I personally find very enjoyable right now and I like the game and for those who enjoyed Far Cry or any type of shooter game this is great.\n\nI love how many options this game gives you for upgradability and changing out your weapons which is a great feature to the game and a pretty decent game changer. I also enjoy the challenge it brings and how you can roam the world without a gun always on your screen. I look forward to unlocking further 'yellow zones' and other things. I was also a huge fan of 'Freedom Fighters' that came out during the good Playstation 2 days. I personally find this game a good successor of both it and the Homefront series and hope to see more like it in the future (with better optimization and graphics).\n\nAs I said don't take negative reviews of this game to seriously. Take this game as it was advertised during E3 and your expectations because it truly delivers and offers a good experience for a open world first person shooter.","May 18","true","11.5"," 54 of 103 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","54","103","2","0"

When i started playing i put an alarm on my phone  for the next 1:30 min to make sure i still had the chance to refund which is 2hrs btw and 12 days (so if you want to refund do it while you can). The first problem i came across was the performance. The game was very jittery throughout. I played the game on low and still had issues. My pc specs is a gtx 760, 16gb ddr4 and a 5820k (bottleneck much) but my setup is for self-explanitory reasons. I was very impatient to get into the fighting and when i did, i felt like garbage. The overall movement such as mantling and aiming feels unfinished. Aiming is just dreadful and this was just the beginning of the game. The start of the game feels slow but gets increasingly better. The concepts and ideas are very innovative but it is ruined by the story and what you must accomplish. Gameplay is repetitive and i got bored and frustrated just so early into the game.\n\nThe first homefront was a thrilling game with a very action-pact feel. In Homefront TR, i dont agree with the open world and would rather keep it as a point-to-point style gameplay still having freedom to explore. But since we cant change anything heres the verdict:\n\nI could see this game enjoyable but frankly no original multiplayer where you fight team vs team and poor optimization, if i was to play this game without spending almost $60, i would find myself discovering better titles that i would rather spend my time playing and not beat myself with the appalling gameflow.\nAND LEAVE THIS GAME TO THE NON-EXISTENT\n\nKAOS STUDIOS and THQ","May 21","false","0.6"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

Despite a rough start and some jank here and there in the form of hitched objective progression that required a couple of restart checkpoints to remedy, the game has overall been pretty crash / glitch free.  The game is graphically impressive cranked all the way up, but it should be noted that on my i7 4790k / 980ti / ssd system I had to drop a few things down from very high to high, namely particle density and object detail, but all the other options were maxed at 1080 and I got a solid 60fps with vsync.  Some strange hitching whenever autosaves are happening, but not too bad beyond that.  The lighting at night in the rain is really quite pretty, and there are really impressive dust storms and fog effects on top of some ridiculously high res textures and water effects make for a better looking game than anything on offer in Fallout 4 and I'd even say there are aspects of the engine that look better than GTA V in an open world setting.  I hope they finish optimizing the game for ultra settings.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of Far Cry and Metal Gear in some weird ways, and there are even times when I found myself feeling like I was in a Fallout game.  Stealth play is viable in most scenarios and the tools given to you come together later in the game to make for some interesting sabotage / raid situations.  A good mix of mission objectives and open world enemy population / mission spawning ensures that you're always doing something different for what feels like the first 15 hours, after which the game settles in to a routine that I've little hope will change much through to the end, but that is OK because the gameplay loop is rather fun.\n\nIt should also be noted that the shooting is rather unforgiving and there are some guided mission objectives that are brutal and demanding.  I almost gave up once or twice, but if you power on and have Dark Souls patience in you then eventually you'll get the hang of it.  I'm playing on the medium difficulty and finding it just right.  AI in general is a bit wonky but enemy engagements are good enough.  Your friendly AI is indeed a bit dumb, but they serve as fodder long enough to give you the upper hand.  This seems to be their job and they do it well enough.\n\nHaving just played DOOM and Uncharted 4 I came into this game with low expectations, between the highs those two games gave me and the review embargo for this game coupled with all the toxic forum discussions about what a turd this game was going to be I have to say that I'm glad I ignored all the naysayers.  I'm looking forward to taking my time with the rest of the game.  From what I've been reading about where I'm at in the campaign, I have another 10-15 hours to go on top of the 20 I already sunk in, and for my money that is a pretty good deal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnisquids/recommended/223100/","omnisquids","The Bird King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnisquids/","139 products in account","The main complaints about this game are about the optimization.\nI have a fairly powerful computer, and it runs fine, albeit i turned a few settings from ultra to high (poor me).\nThere are occasional lag spikes, once every 10 minutes i'd say, but it's not game breaking at all.\nSeeing as I'm not a whiny baby, i realize that optimization is something that will be fixed in a month or two through patches, and if its not, THEN i'd be worried, but until then, we're going to look at the game from a non technological standpoint.\n\nMy only complaint so far is that i feel like i was thrown into the action a little too fast. Not enough intro plot for me, but an hour in, i was very comfortable with how the game was going.\nGameplay wise, it's similar to farcry.\nLiberate zones to increase your support in the region, disable North Korean infrastructure, and gain the "hearts and minds" of the people, to bring more people to the revolution. This is done by capturing special objectives and areas, like observation points, patrol areas, securable areas, saving civilians, broadcasting revolution propaganda in place of North korean propoganda, and a few other ways as well. The hearts and minds system is a nice refresher to this style of gameplay.\n\nThe combat feels good. You have the choice between stealthing, brute force, or hit and run tactics using tech you aquire in the game.\nFor example, a remote car explosive device could be driven under an armored patrol vehicle and detonated, destroying it and the soldiers patrolling with it, letting you stay at a safe distance and leave quickly.\nThe guns feel good, the sounds are nice and even on hardened you can take down norks with a good headshot, or a few body shots.\nThe most interesting part of this would probably be the weapons customization.\nFor your first weapon, you are given a pistol and an SMG conversion. To apply this conversion, you remove the slide of the pistol, insert the lower into the SMG upper and load the magazine, all of this being a very nice animation you actually see in game.\nYou can also switch out AR15 uppers, shotgun parts, and pretty much anything else you want on the fly.\nI'll probably update this review once i've completed the game, but so far, i can safely say most of the compaints and negative reviews are based upon the game not being properly optimized for the PC, which is understandable, but not enough to give it a negative review in my opinion.","May 17","true","4.1"," 139 of 271 people (51%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","51","139","271","12","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illuminatty/recommended/223100/","illuminatty","Natty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illuminatty/","256 products in account","Why hello, old friend!Now here's a game I didnt think I would see again. Homefront was a game that I thought I would never really see again, and honestly, I dont think anyone really did. But, it's here, much to my surprise. Although, this surprise is mostly from the lack of advertising and marketing for it, I hadn't seen an ad anywhere, nor any commercials.\n\nThe PerformanceOh boy. I am still not sure after 7 hours of playing how I feel about this. I have not had any massive frame skipping, stuttering, nor lag. However, there is a considerable amount of hitching when scripted moments occur during the game, and they are very easy to predict. I'm not really sure why this occurs, though it does seem to happen 99% of the time during climactic events or large enemy spawns. I was able to run this game at a constant 60FPS with no drops, spare the hitching during the events I have stated.\n\nThe GameplayThe gunplay of this game is relatively responsive, and the modifications, though limited, certainly help your weapons feel more alive. Watching your character slide the barrel and forgrip off of an assault rifle, only to slap on a much larger one with a belt fed box magazine to effectively convert your old M4 into a M249 is very pleasing, albeit a bit silly. The guns kick as you would expect, without any massive spikes in recoil. This can be relieved by the addition of foregrips and worsened by muzzle breaks. The game follows a Dying Light-esque parkour system, with vaulting, climbing, and sliding. You can equip certain gear items to imrpove your performance in these areas, such as knee pads to improve sliding distances. While there is always a nice feeling of excitement when you can afford a new piece of gear, the selection feels rather bland in the story mode.\n\nThe AIGood lord, the AI in this game is hilariously bad. Enemies will either be incredibly responsive and aggressive, or will not notice you at all when you mow down their friends with your weaponry. Friend and foe alike will find themselves battling their pathing routes more than each other, shooting walls and getting stuck on trash cans. While this can be frustrating, it can prove to be equally amusing, even if it is an extremely masochistic way.\n\nThe Co-OpGoodbye, TDM. This game features mission based co-op, having the settings of several revolutionary battles between the North Korean Army and the Resistance. There are 6 missions total, each taking about 15 to 30 minutes depending on your teamwork and responsiveness to things going sour. You are then rewarded with EXP and money, which you may spend on skill and equipment. The equipment in this game is given to you in cases, each costing anywhere from $500 to $3000, depending on the quality of the gear and what you get from it. There is a lot of gear and vanity items to choose from, some better than others, but there is definitely an extensive display here. I find myself being drawn to wanting the better gear that looks much more militarized, and it definitely has kept me playing this far. I would not buy this game strictly for the co-op however, as it does get tiresome after a few missions.\n\nFinal ThoughtsWhile Homefront: The Revolution has definitely shown that it is trying to achieve greatness, it ultimately falls short of its dreams. Boring quests with uninteresting characters, uninspired voice acting and some poor sound sync and design drag this game down significantly. However, I can't help but adore this game. I find myself wanting to play more, and the amount of customization options in the co-op mode definitely add some depth to this game, even if the models are preset. If you are hyped about this game, you should probably leave it at the door, and come into it with an open mind. You might just find yourself pleasantly surprised by this game.\n\nFinal Score: 7/10","May 17","true","12.1"," 85 of 165 people (52%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","52","85","165","9","3"

The price was reasonable, it had all the parts, but when you get in the door opens with screech, the key required a little force to get into the ignition and it reluctantly starts up after turning over a few times.\n\nYour first ride is rough and bumpy, there's strange noises coming from everything, so you find yourself deviating from your course home to feel out the problems with a few detours, twists and turns, trying to pinpoint the issues it seems to have with the steering. The air-con doesn't seem to hold the right temperature, so you wind down the electric window, only to find there's a slight stutter as it drops a few steps, rather than giving a smooth wind. The stereo is only picking up a few stations with a bit of static, you can't find a good song and the talkback channels are a bit annoying, the off switch doesn't seem to work, so you just have to turn the volume down to 0%. You wanna have a cigarette to calm your nerves and frustration, but there's no lighter or ash tray, even so, you can't be bothered pulling into the 7-Eleven to buy a lighter, because you just wanna get the damn thing home and assess the whole deal, so you just imagine how good it would have been to have a smoke with your cool new ride.\n\nYou've driven around in the built up areas for a while now, the GPS has led you astray a few times and the route path seems quite disjointed, so you decide to jump on the freeway and open up before you dump it home and watch a movie to get your mind off things, there only seems to be four gears that grind into place even with the softest clutch control, and the engine has a limiter on, so you can't even let some frustration out by breaking the speed limit, but even then, the fuel gauge starts beeping and you've just hit reserve level.\n\nYou get it Home and park out Front, giving the thing a bit of gas in neutral to test The engine Revolution, which is a little underwhelming, but for some reason you're not entirely upset, but more disappointed with your new car, it has a slightly unique shape and colour from other cars, but the same stock-standard cheaply sourced parts from various suppliers, that don't seem to have been oiled or put together properly. Quality control was probably a bit slack, and you get the feeling this model was rushed into production to meet demand.\n\nYou find yourself having to shoulder-barge the door open to get out, the button doesn't work to remotely lock the doors and set the alarm, so you have to go back and lock it manually. Pulling the key out, you realise the back left tire is flat, but you just walk inside and throw the car keys on the floor, crack open a nice cold beer and wonder why you hadn't read any reviews about the car, waited a little longer before buying a brand new model or just taken it back to the dealer instead of driving all the way home. You're not entirely bummed though, it may be because you're equipped with those silly human traits of faith and hope, so you decide you'll leave it for a while, wait for a tow truck and let the mechanics sort it out eventually, because with a bit of oil, some fine tuning and a few added features, this car could one day be a sweet ride. But for now, you'll just use your trusty old whip to get you around.","May 27","false","15.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

As with many others, I wanted nothing more than this game to be a success, but the first 30 minutes of gameplay have left me feeling cheated almost.  The original Homefront had issues, but it was enjoyable to play regardless.  If the combat was tight and on point like other games using the same engine then many issues could be looked past, but when the basics of movement, gun control and shooting feedback are lacking it is hard to physically continue playing without causing damage to ones keyboard, mouse or soul.  It seems a higher priority was placed on quantity rather than quality... delaying this for another year would have been a better idea than releasing as is\n\nI feel sorry for the developers and presenters of this as they must have been going through shock treatment to big up this one in front of the public.

I've seen all of the horrid reviews describing this game as terrible, but personally I can already tell this will be one of my favorite games of the year. The story is quite intriguing to me, I love the revolutionary aspect. The environments are beautiful, even though I run the game on low due to a bad computer. It runs at a solid frame rate for me as well. The gameplay is amazing, too. The guns each individual different recoil kicks and sounds make them quite distinct from eachother and gunfights feel amazing. The weapon customization is one of the best things about this game, as every gun has 2 other sub-types. For example, the battle rifle, my personal favorite weapon, comes off the shop as a DMR, but it can also be turned into a semi-auto sniper rifle and even a "freedom launcher" rocket launcher! Every gun in the game including the basic pistol has 2 other weapon convertions available for it, adding even more variability and possibilities for strategy. In my setup, I use a shotgun with the "incendiary launcher" conversion with a marksman rifle as my other weapon. The game will remind you a lot of Far Cry, as it is open world and has different zones with activities to do inside, like capturing outposts. Except, this game takes that Far Cry formula to the next level. The outposts to capture have variability and are fun, instead of the Far Cry outposts where I'd get bored and find them just as tedious chores to do. The world around you feels alive as while you walk around, some citizens may support you, but others may be "Nork" sympathizers. This game is truly a diamond hidden in the rough. The only problem is the sub-par optimization. Frame drops aren't too common but they happen sometimes and it's a bit of a inconvienence but I can get past this as I enjoy the game a lot. The game is actually rather difficult, too. I played it on normal difficulty with aim assist off and I found that stealth was a requirement unless I did some hit and run. You might want to go guns blazing right off the bat but patience is the key as you really feel like you are a revolutionary due to the KPA outnumbering and outgunning you. The multiplayer is actually very fleshed out and really makes you feel as if you are a revolution. You can do some amazing things when you work together in this co-op mode. Now, for the final verdict. I reccomend buying it on sale due to those optimization errors and bad AI, but wait a while and that will be fixed (hopefully). I give the game an 8.5/10 due to stellar gameplay and story, only limited by bad AI and a below-average launch.","May 18","true","4.9"," 42 of 82 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","42","82","2","0"

In total I've committed about 13 hours to it, and I have completed both the campaign and most of the strikepoints. The length of the game is far shorter than many have claimed, but it still is longer than average for most AAA titles. Whilst I enjoyed what I played, I can't recommend the game until the AI and optimisation are fixed, as these two are critical in holding it back.\n\nA few things worth noting.\n\nGraphics - Although it may be poorly optimised, the game is quite aesthetically pleasing. The environment has quite a lot of detail, and is fairly immersive for an open world game.\nAI -  is broken and needs a full overhaul. The AI suffers from pathfinding issues, and is generally dumb in combat often charging in wrecklessly.\nOptimisation - Througout my playthrough I had my settings on Ultra (aside from AA) and was playing at a resolution of 2560x1440. Unfortunately the game lacks an SLi profile (attempting to use Nvidia Inspector to force it creates a broad array of graphical issues).\nForgettable generic characters","May 28","false","12.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As I haven't finished this game and don't really intend to I can't speak of the later campain.\n\nStarting off with the first few mission on the game it seemed like it was going to be very story driven introducing you to the characters and making out you were relatively new to this "freedom fighter" role. After the first few missions are over you're thrown into a massively open world with no real sense of purpose, you'll get your main missions that are accessed through your phone that seem to send you to a new area everytime and then there's a load of side missions that don't seem to progress anything at all and there is no consequence to not doing them.\n\nThen you have the zone capturing to get on with slowly freeing the area from the KPA and if the first zone is anything to go by you might as well not bother because it will get rid of the enemies and well... there's just no point, weapons and equipment all seem tied to the main mission regardless of these zones.\nYellow zones play out a little differently as you can pretend you're a civilian in these areas and supposedly blend in with  the crowd, yet for some reason every guard instantly recognises you like you're some big shot rebel guy even after only one mission. When you're spotted in these zones you'll get an alert status meaning every guard in the area will start shooting you and actively persue you, so you'll have to hide as endless waves of enemies will spawn until the alert status has passed.\n\nThe multiplayer is kind of fun for a bit but I only really got a few hours out of it as it only has like 5 missions, you can get new gear and such from supply boxes which just give you random crap, as far as I can tell you just need to buy weapon packs until you have the weapon you want but it really is pointless because there's a really limited amount of missions to use them on.\n\nWell to sum it up I'm just really dissapointed, I loved the first game as it felt like you were actually helping america fight for freedom in this one it just feels like you're mindlessly following the star shaped objective marker.\n0/10","May 31","false","9.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I expected more out of this game, it can't even compare to the first one. Sure it had its moments however over all it felt kinda dull to be honest, the atmosphere felt kinda nice and the graphics wasn't that bad however the story line was weak and it didn't really capture you the player EVER.\n\nTo me a great game needs to capture the player like it does in The Last of Us or other games where you just wanna keep playing and playing and playing and wish it never ends. This game never does that and you play on wishing it would end faster yet the developers keep draging out a thin story as long as it goes without making it better or more exciting.\n\nThis is an open world game in the style of Far Cry 3, 4 and Primal, you get different "bases" to take over throughout the game and it just goes on and on and on without any major changes.\n\nYou could bascially say this is a remake of a Far Cry game or any other open world capture points game, without the fun and exciting story and instead a pretty dull and weak story and a fairly predictable one too. And not to forget MUCH WORSE, if you're thinking of buying this game then buy Far Cry 4 instead!\n\nOh and not to forget, the AI in the game is just crap to be honest. They get stuck everywhere and act all weird etc.\n\nI feel like I've wasted my money, money that I could have used to buy some ice cream or some cola, that would have brought me more joy than this game and at least I wouldn't feel like I've wasted my money on something completely useless.\n\nI really liked the first Homefront, you got captured in the story and it was really likeable as a game.\n\nThis game gets\n2/10\n\nI would not recommend other players to buy it at the moment because like I've said it's like a Far Cry game without the fun or exciting parts.","May 20","false","13.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I purchased in haste after reading a brief overview of the Game, and as soon as I saw "Crytek Engine" I made my purchase.\n\nI regret that decision. It's not the worst game in the world, but the fact they are charging $60 for this unfinished, buggy title is a bit dissapointing.\n\nGraphically, not terrible, but it performs poorly even on sufficient hardware. They are supposedly supposed to improve this with upcoming patches, if so then this game is not bad in the Graphics department, but a lot of Texture work is subpar. You can tell they cut a lot of corners on this to get it out there. Lighting and overall "look" still trump CoD IMO, which still looks like the first Modern Warfare with better Textures and lighting. That series also suffers from performance issues.\n\nGameplay is very basic. A lot of control point missions, nothing fancy. AI isn't great. In the end you basically run around shooting stuff, taking over bases. If that's enough to keep you occupied then you aren't going to find much else to do. It's the same stuff they've been putting out for 10+ years. Also, there's 1 vehicle, and it's a Dirt Bike. Nothing special, it gets you from Point A to Point B.\n\nI'm not going to hold a grudge against the Developers, as they were put in a crappy situation. They may still redeem themselves with future Addons\Updates, but at this time I can't recommend this game at it's current price point. I just purchased the Original Ghost Recon Series for $10 on sale and I will probably get a lot more play time from those games.\n\n-Justin\n\n\n\n","May 30","false","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It’s clear there were a number of unique ideas being bandied about during the development of this game, and there’s certainly shadows of those ideas in the full release, but its “me too” design fails to come together in any meaningful way. As a complete package, it struggles on many levels to deliver, chiefly, the story and gameplay. With time, many of the bugs should be fixed, and who knows, maybe the DLC offered post-release might improve on the story. At the moment, from former Free Radical developers, Homefront: The Revolution is nothing less than a disappointing, if not outright terrible game.","May 30","false","15.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Well if you’re thinking is it worth putting time into this game or not, I’d say it is. It’s not hard to 100% this game I’d say you’ll see lots of 100% in the 30-40hr range. Is it worth the Price? If you only care about the story, I’d say no. But if you’re looking at 100% and like a Far Cry style game with  some  Multiplayer then I’d say Yes. If you want a Multiplayer game Then move along, nothing to see here.\n\nIt doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the Homefront was inspired by the movie Red Dawn(1984)\n\nWhile its story length was around the same as your average Call of Duty game (~6hours) it left the groundwork in place for a fantastic series, sadly Homefront: The Revolution abandons that and starts anew in an alternate timeline.\nHomefront:TR plays more like a Far Cry game then Call of Duty or Battlefield but its limited side jobs (20 of them) and lack of zone replay after you clear an area make me look at a zone and wonder what the most efficient way to clear it is, instead of wanting to get lost exploring. The story feels mediocre at best due to the nature of the game, story missions generally send you to the next zone after 2 or so it’s hard to really connect with any of the characters. You’ll spend your time in a zone winning the ‘Hearts & Minds’ of the people, collecting radios, responding to emergency calls for help called ‘Flashpoints’ along with your main goal of attacking enemy strongholds and pushing the KPA out of that district.\n\nDeathwish\nUnlike other shooters the hard difficulty called ‘Deathwish’ doesn’t feel like it punishes you for going on the offensive, Run & Gun is an option and you’re not forced into walking everywhere aiming down your sights.  Instead ‘Deathwish’ chooses to punish you for poor positioning during a fight, such as getting flanked or not paying attention to where you start a fight ie in the range of other patrols/turrets/overwatch. Even the Snipers don’t 1 shot you on ‘Deathwish’ which is always a plus in my book for this type of play.\n\nAI\nThe AI can have moments of  Genius   Proper coding  Luck. Getting flanked on each side by a Heavy while having a patrol moving into an adjacent building to get the high ground all while 2 APCs pin me down. This might be tricky if the game didn’t Hack tools (A craftable & buyable gadget that takes control of KPA drones and turns them against the KPA  soldiers  Peacekeepers) But for the most part the AI is easily fooled and can be a joke once you get the hang of the way the react. But then again welcome to the AI of 95% of FPSs on the market.\n\nMultiplayer\nThis game does not have Player vs. Player, it’s unknown if they will ever add PvP but they do give you a 4 player Co-Op mode separate from the main story called ‘Resistance’. In ‘Resistance’ you create a character (from a group of presets) and select their background prior to the KPA  Invasion  peacekeeping efforts. the characters gain skill points that can be spent Borderlands style into abilities and perks. Gearing up you character requires you  to sacrifice small kittens  buy loot crates with in game currency that is acquired by completing missions. A smart move not putting gear behind micro transactions as that may have killed this game for many gamers. The missions themselves are fairly open with multiple ways to get to your objective but once you arrive it plays out the same each time, an exception to this I’ve seen would be one of the early missions has you attack a convoy. The 3 times I’ve played it the convoy has taken a different route each time. I can’t see myself grinding money in Multiplayer however having people that know how to have fun makes it enjoyable.\n\nPerformance\nBla Bla Bla I have 9-way SLI Fury Zs and It dips to 23 fps. Honestly I don’t know how so many people are having trouble with the game but lots of people claim to be having it.\nHere is my advice don’t listen to either side on Performance, good or bad. Decide if you want the game and are going to buy it or not, ignoring what fps you’ll have with your system specs. Then match your specs with that of the System Requirements if you can run the game based on those alone then buy it and if you don’t like the way it preforms on   YOUR   system. Then use the steam refund feature if you’re not happy with the graphics or fps.\n\nSeason Pass\nYou $5 off for buying the game with the season pass. This is a gamble you  could  save 5 dollars on expansions you love or you  could  waste $20 on expansions you hate. Then there is option #3: Wait. I don’t think season passes are worth it, 1 bad dlc that you wouldn’t buy standalone can usually offset the cost of the discount. In the end, it’s your money.\n\nI was not paid to write this, nor did I receive the game for free.\nI felt the need to write this because I feel that a lot of game review sites  like IGN  aren’t giving it a fair shot and criticized elements that they praised in other games  just because they didn’t get paid off\nI also don’t like the amount of steam users that downvote this game and have less than 2 hours in it.\n\nGood Luck & Have Fun","May 19","true","23.1"," 57 of 112 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","57","112","2","0"

So please disslike this review "Dumb-usters".\nHardcore Gamer - "While Homefront: The Revolution had potential to be great, its mediocre gameplay, lackluster story and myriad of technical issues make it one of the biggest disappointments of the generation. The PC’s iteration’s disastrous framerate and texture streaming follies take what could have been a halfway decent game and make it a pure test of patience on the part of the player."\n\nCons:\n- repetitive from first mission,\n- ugly graphics (like from 2010),\n- fps amazingly unstable (120-25)\n- bad voice acting,\n- can not pick up enemie weapons,\n- the same type of enemies, just some of them are bigger (bullet sponge)\n- can not use enemies vehicles,\n- ocean is just flat surface (WTF! did developers gave up ?)\n- dumb enemies and allies,\n- not an open word,\n- just few weapons,\n- very easy even on hard,\n- just one vehicle (motorbike),\n- can not skip cut scenes,\n- sound glitches,\n- nothing like Far Cry or Assassins Creed (people compare it).\n\nPlease avoid this game like AIDS. Developers should loss their jobs not for releasing this garbage but for creating false positive reviews. I loved first Homefront and you ruined it.\nSimply put, Homefront: The Revolution is outclassed in its bracket by every other big-budget game released this generation. And that’s without getting into how shockingly ♥♥♥♥ the PC version is...This game made me feel unwell, it bored me to tears, and it irritated the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nMy PC specs:\ni7 4770K 3.9 GHz\nMSI Gtx 980ti\n32Gb RAM Corsair Vengeance\nSamsung 850 EVO 250 Gb SSD\nGigabyte Z97P-D3 MOBO\nThis game should work like a charm on my PC!!!\nMy game was refunded.

I understand Homefront is primarily a single player experience, but with how bad the multiplayer is; there was no point in even including it.\nIt massively lacks any sort of content or progression. After the few hours I've played, I've already unlocked a majority of the weapons and a good chunk of any items to affect combat. The talent trees lack depth and the only real fun thing to pick up are cosmetic items; which can hardly hold a dry multiplayer scene with a couple maps down.\nIf I wanted to collect cosmetic rewards all day, I'll at least do it in a more captivating and rewarding gaming experience like Overwatch.","May 27","false","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The sequel oh wow so much wasted potential, first off if you were hoping to pick up at the end of Homefront nope ignores it completely.\nCombat wise well it's an fps you point you shoot enemies die. It does not have deep mechanics but it does have a pretty good weapon customization design. You can basically turn any of the 6/7 main types of gun into three other weapons for example the pistol can be converted to an SMG and to a silcenced single shot pistol etc.\nThe AI is pretty basic playing on Normal difficulty they seem to run straight at you or just past you in an attempt to get to cover, though it is fairly easy to get overwhelmed in the more combat intensive red zones.\nThe main story campaign is okay not as interesting as the first homefront story at least to me, the open world sections feel like massive padding you do the same two or three types of side mission 6/7 times you free a zone and then you move onto the next one for a total of 12 zones I am currently slogging my way through zone 6 i think at this point I doubt I will finish it.\n\nBottom line if you want to give it a try wait for a steam sale, or a free weekend because i have a feeling the way multi player is dropping off a free event cannot be too far behind.","May 29","false","14.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The enemy AI is very poor; at medium difficulty the game is way too easy.\n\nThe theme appealed me a lot, but because of all the problems, you do not get immersed in what was supposed to be a rebellion against foreign forces.\n\nThe graphics obviously suffer from the fact that this is a multiplatform game and textures have to be toned down for the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nLastly, there are some serious optimization issues.

Go figure, right.\nUsing mouse and keyboard is just awful. IT's totally meant for console. No M & K\nsetting except sensitivity.That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! it's like the mouse lags and can;t catch up to my movements.Also If you shot your weapon at any time in the game the KPA will swarm you and never stop! This game just doesn't work any an "open world" shooter. It's just that awful. God why did i buy this even for $25 it's not worth it. People always say games are terrible. Il ike to judge for myself, and this is terrible. There's no fixing this game. it can't be done.

I think it is a awesome story with some really cool concepts on the future of America in captivity. This is a perfect sequel to the original Homefront by THQ. Some things that would be awesome. 1. 30 fps lock built in 2. If the screen on the phone was a little bit easier to see, slightly more seamless from map to other settings and back to game play. 3. The recoil on the guns needs to be scaled back slightly. Without auto aiming enabled its a struggle to hit your targets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacobPriceChloePrice/recommended/223100/","JacobPriceChloePrice","X_[Homefront_[The]_Revolution]_X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacobPriceChloePrice/","49 products in account","Well, i have to say i got one more best title in my life. Trully i'm really enjoying it, mostly i loved it's gameplay, visual quality, features, weapon systems and combat stuffs, location, in-game details, story. I actually like serious situations where we have to do something for our city, out country and our world. In these types of situations, you will get amazing missions to play with hard gameplay. So sometimes you have to be tricy and stealthy for hard atmospheres but sometimes you have to rush like hit and run. In this case, opponents gonna be serious and also seek for attack. So this title is just like my type, like what i wanted from developers. So let me explain about it in few topics.\n\nGameplay\nI got so much things to say about it. There is hella cool fun out there. We have so much things to do there. You will get tons of side quests and mini tasks as much as you explore it around the world. Also you would be rewarded with dollars if you complete these side quests and help civilians. There will be few civilians will ask you to help them like donating some dollars to beggers, releasing prisons, killing bullies and many more. In-game, whole world will be in control of KPA soldiers. Because they sorrounded the whole town and distructing it. So you can recruite your team soldiers around the town to help you to capture strike points, KPA strongholds, KPA covoys. Sometimes you need to use hack stuffs for hacking their Apex technology what is in used to sucure regions from revolutionary soldiers and recruits. So it's hella amazing.\n\nOptimization\nWe all know this game got some issues for bugs, FPS drops. But in my experience, i didn't yet face any bugs but FPS drops. It has to be fixed as soon as possible. Because it's not so cool for it. But i have to say this title isn't so well optimized. It's seems really bad on optimization. So not getting so high FPS. But playing on ultra high setting with all maxed out except AA.\n\nVisual Quality/GFX\nI'm really amazed with it's visual. Seems so perfect and remarkable in all the way. But at night it looks far more amazing than it seems at day time. I can see they really putted perfection on it. Too much highly detailed breathing and lively world. So there is more fun to play at night situation with my recruits i choose. So you won't be disappointed for visuals\n\nCoolest Features\nThere are lots of amazing and cool features for best gameplay ever. Let's start with the smartphone you will get in-game for directions, journals, contacts, map, camera, identifications, emails, texts. You can use your camera to identify and mark hostiles and KPA threats. So it's really helpful for all of us in high risky spots where we have to be stealthy. With message feature you can contact with your alleys to direct you. You can craft hacking stuffs, pipe bombs, GTK stuffs. For crafting you can get resources around the world. Also you can buy them from safe house. In these situations you may need much more ammos, so you will get tons of stashes there but those are hidden for not showing KPA soldiers because if they get any stashes in their hands, they may remove them. Also you can upgrade your weapons for heavy armored cars, patrolls, goliath, turrets, KPA drones.\n\nLemme rate this title in few ways\n+ Gameplay : 10/10\n+ Visual Quality : 9/10\n- Optimization : 5/10\n+ Combating weapons and stuffs : 7/10\n+ Location and Details : 9/10\n+ Characters : 7/10\n+ Features : 10/10\n+ Background Scores : 9/10\n\nPros\n+ Quiet Remarkable Gameplay Experience\n+ Stunning and Gorgeus Visuals\n+ Enjoyable Epic Actions\n+ Serious and Effective Situations\n+ Quiet Hard Missions and Side Quests\n+ Helpful Recruits Available Around The City For Better Combat Action\n+ Rocking Background Scores Matching With Situations\n+ Atmospheric Situations\n\nCons\n- In-game Progress Saving Feature\n\nSo overally this is the best title for me in every way i experienced till now. Those who loved and enjoyed Crysis 2, they will surely love this one as well. Because gameplay situations and atmospheres are quiet familier. Let's burn them in the fire of revolution...","June 6","true","30.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razika117/recommended/223100/","razika117","Razika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razika117/","63 products in account","First, I would like to say that I think all the hate for this game is a bit misplaced. To many reviewers base their reviews solely on how well the game runs. I think that it is an important factor yes, but people should review on content as well.\n\nDoes the game stutter, or suffer from graphical problems. Yes. Slightly. I am used to running Fallout, skyrim, MGS:TPP, Killing Floor 2, Elite Dangerous, basically everything I own on high or max settings with 60fps. Currently I am running about 47-50fps on the "High" settings. There was some tearing and choppiness, but turning on V-sync helps.\n\nThere are complaints about lip syncing being bad. My answer to that is, "Have you played any video game, ever?" I don't think I have ever seen a game with perfect lip sync, or even what I would call great. Mouths are hard to animate. Get over it. If you really care so much about lip syncing, that that kills the game for you, you need to lighten your standards.\n\nNow, IN TERMS OF ACTUAL GAME PLAY AND CONTENT!!!\nI would say this is definitely worth a purchase. Try it. I found the whole Koreans invading the US a bit Red-Dawn esque, but if you can get by it, the story is not half bad. I am only in about an hour or so, but everything has been pretty solid so far.\n\nMOVEMENT/GUNPLAY: Movement handles pretty much how you would expect from a CryEngine game. It can be a bit blocky. Yes, your character moves slow, but what you have to realize is that this isnt Halo or COD where you just run around and shoot people in turbo mode. You are outnumbered, outgunned, and outclassed in about every way, so moving slow is essential to make sure you dont run smack into a patrol and die.  The gunplay is crisp and rewarding, and it feels good when your bullets find their mark. I think people have gotten too used to being super soldiers, and expect too much flashy gunplay. While it doesn't suffer the "cap gun" feel of COD and some other games, the gun sounds could use more "oomph" to them.\n\nAI: While I have only had about an hour to examine the AI, I will say that I have been more impressed with other games, but that being said, I have definitely seen much worse AI, in more popular games. Have the people complaining about the AI ever played a Bethesda game, like ever??? The enemy AI seems pretty keen, and I have deliberately fired shots just to see how well their "search" mechanic feels, and I think it is pretty good. You definitely feel like you are being searched for, rather than the AI just going through the motions.\n\nIs it worth 60 bucks? I think so. To the rapid-fire, ADD-like, spastic pewdiepie generation, it might bee too slow for you. I am playing on the normal difficulty, and I have died several times in firefights, but never have I felt cheated or gypped. You will die after being shot a few times. Welcome to real life pal. No BS overshields, no health regen that babies you. Preparation and thoughtful execution of your objectives will give you satisfying payoffs and make you feel like you really worked to liberate that stronghold, or find those supplies.\n\nTL:DR\nBottom line; Don't let the negative hype decide for you. Buy it, put an hour into it, and decide for yourself. You can always refund.","May 18","true","11.6"," 40 of 81 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","40","81","4","0"

It is certainly not a Far Cry or Call of Duty, but has still to offer certain new and interesting ideas to the genre\nHere is my first impression after 4 hours of gameplay. If this will change over the course of the further time I play the game. I will give provide you with an update.\n\nWhat I like so far\nGreat graphics, Cry Engine is doing a good job in this game\nInteresting setting which continues the Korean-saga from the first title\nOpen-world, plenty of missions, overall satisfying gameplay, good mix between gun n run as well as stealth action\nGood gunplay, modifiable weapons, perks, satisfying shooting feeling\nCrafting, gathering materials, money\nFeels a bit like Far Cry but without copying it too plumply\nAchievements, Steam Cards\nWhat I don't like\n\nPerfomance / optimization has some problems; game has micro-stutters; might be fixable if the developers are interested in doing so\nDifficulty seems not to be fully balanced\nAI sometimes acts weird; what means sometimes they are super intelligent and strong and the other time they stand in front of you and do almost nothing\nRepetitive mission design, no real difference in the what the objectif of the mission is\nCopied from Far Cry without reaching its class\nStory a nice add-on, but actually you do not really care what is going on\nLimited to a 3 weapon load out\nHomefront: The Revolution got a lot of bad reviews and a lot moderate ones. I would see this game exactly in the moderate field. It is fun. It has its flaws. But in the end it will entertain you. Therefore, if you need some new FPS with open world elements, this might be for you. Otherwise, you should of course first go for Far Cry 3 and 4 as well as get some of the newer AAA FPS, if you haven't played them yet.","May 23","true","4.5"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","18","37","0","3"

Settings like post processing for example that just make everything look blurry and remove 20 FPS from your performance. You can have the game look amazing and run great with the right settings.....

Story is great for me, it's not perfect but is great. Characters are well-written, I really liked their character and how they act (Especially Dana). Gameplay, I'm kinda sad because there weren't any stealth options only when the quest (I think we can call it the quest) was telling you to be quiet and stealthy, I couldn't approach that part of story without getting detected or I didn't see that opportunity, well if I am wrong then sorry, what more we had points to capture and capturing those was hell a lot of fun !

I had hoped to see something different from the annual CoD iteration but they pretty much wasted the theme - liberating areas is way too easy (interact with the objective to make hostiles vanish instantly), and once you have liberated a zone you get plenty of allied redshirts, an infinite supply of rockets and will never be bothered by the KPA again.\nTo be fair, the campaign is no worse than the annual CoD - less flashy explosions, but a slightly more original theme but then again you probably wouldn't buy CoD for the singleplayer.\n\nMultiplayer is dead, which is just as well because it's just a generic cheap "farm missions for cash to buy loot crates" Skinner box.\n\nI didn't encounter any massive bugs other than the fact that the photographic quest didn't progress (blindly stabbing the target did work, but frankly that entire mission should have been scrapped given how utterly inadequate controls are - e.g. you cannot stand up while holding the phone, so designing a mission around holding the phone is utterly stupid).\n\nPerformance wise, FPS seemed to hover around 50 (with a few drops, including one brief case of FPS dropping 5 for no apparent reason in the prison area) in a R390, i7-6700k, 16GB VM i.e. it runs a lot worse than better looking games like Fallout 4.","June 1","false","14.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The complaints about the slow frame rate and stuttering reminded me of the complaints about Just Cause 3. When I played JC3 with 6Gb of RAM, it stuttered to the point I couldn't play it. I upped my RAM from 6Gb to 24Gb and all problems ceased. Great game, plays great with plenty of RAM. I figured the complaints about Homefront were the same, so I bought it anyway. This is one of the best games I've bought in a long time. Lot's of fun, great graphics, physics, and storyline. So, bottom line, when they say the recommended RAM is 8Gb,, just plan on 12Gb or more. These newer games with massive amounts of texture maps, lighting, and action require more than they recommend. I'm running all settings on all games at max on a 2009 Alienware ALX, GTX 970, 8 cores at 3.3Ghz, RAID 0 with 2 500Gb SSDs. 24Gb DDR3. I run all games at highest settings possible.

You are the resistance, not master chief. Normal humans fighting against a impossible enemy where you are outmanned and outgunned in every possible way.

So far I have no complaints, i'll update the review when i've beaten the game, but i'm happy with my purchase :D.\n\nPs. The game is getting alot of bad reviews, mostly seems to be because of optimization issues (or just people hating on new release games with the other cool kids). While the optimization could be much better, this game has incredible graphics and i'm running it fine at 4k. Hopefully Dambuster will keep the game updated and maybe add some cool stuff to it like the devs of dying light did. This game is pretty awesome already but with some love and care from the dev's could become a 9/10 or so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xRelentlessXx/recommended/223100/","xRelentlessXx","x Relentless Xx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xRelentlessXx/","165 products in account","Homefront: The Revolution Honest Review\nFirst and foremost, I want to address the frame drop issues everyone is talking about. The only time the game has major frame drops is when you liberate a camp/outpost after it loads back into the game, or when the game loads after coming out of the weapon locker. Everytime it frame drops its during a NON CRITICAL moment, and it is only for a second and the frames catch back up and stay stable. When you are in a critical moment; IE: firefights, cutscenes, main/optional objectives, the framerate is smooth and stable. THAT is the framerate issue, it is not game breaking. DO NOT let it push you away from buying it. If you are wondering my PC specs, I have a 4790K @4.7GHz and an Overclocked GTX 980Ti @1415MHz. I am also running the game on MOSTLY high settings with 100-170FPS\n\nNow on for the review itself.\n\nGraphics\nIts running on the Cryengine 3 engine, of course the graphics look great. The world is plentiful and does feel alive in the Yellow zones. The world is less dense in the Red zones, considering they are free fire zones and covilians are not allowed to be in the Red zones. You really do feel like you are in a more Apocolyptic U.S. The upside is it is open world, the downside is, the world is not very big and you do have loading screens between zones. Lighting is what you would expect in a current AAA title with dynamic lighting. Shadows are a little dissapointing unfortunately. Shadows look as if Deep Silver really said *** it with the shadows because they look like they need 100x Antialiasing. Overall, the graphics are very good, not phenominal, but very good.\n\nGameplay\nThe 2nd biggest reason most people look for in a AAA game. I am going to come right out and say this. If you like the way Far Cry played (Specifically Far Cry 4), you are simply going to like the way Homefront: The Revolution plays too. Open world, outpost liberation, alot of optional side missions, crafting, gathering recources, stealth mechanics, it simply plays VERY much like Far Cry 4, simple as that.\n\nSound and Voice\nThis is where the game lacks a little bit, other than the main characters and cutscenes, the voice acting in the open world is a little dissapointing making the world feel slightly off (despite what i said about the world in the graphics segment). The sound itself is satisfying. Plinking around at the KPA with a Battle Rifle sounds nice (and is satisfyingly fun :D), explosions are booming (obviously lol), the broadcasts you hear around the zones feel real, but can sometimes be repetitive. The music is good and comes on at the right times in the right way, but i recommend turning down the music in the settings before you play because if you dont, the music's volume will overpower the overall game sound. Overall, the game sounds are satisfying and immersive, which is what sound in a game's purpose is.\n\nConclusion\nIn a nutshell, this review was done honestly to counter the nay sayers that are expecting a perfect to near perfect game on every release. Hence, the frame drop issue. They get frame drops in non critical spots that dont effect gameplay so they immediately pin it as a bad game and don't even play it for more than an hour or 2. Okay rant over :). The REAL conclusion is, If you enjoyed Far Cry 4, you will enjoy Homefront: The Revolution. I have 25 hours on Far Cry 4 and i already have 5+ hours on Homefront: The Revolution as of this review. Do not let the frame drop issue push you away from purchasing it. The graphics are great, the gameplay is phenominal, and the sound COULD be better but its very good for what it is. The only MAJOR gripe i have about this game are the NPC's. You cannot push an NPC out of the way if they are standing in a doorway or in a narrow path that you need to get into. The only way to get through is to back up and let the NPC walk through clearing the path. Long story short, NPC's have the right of way, ALWAYS lol.\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nGameplay - 9.5/10\nSound and Voice - 7/10\nOverall Score - 8.5/10","May 17","true","8.0"," 41 of 84 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","41","84","3","0"

Still purchased.  I have a custom system I built of 2x 980 Ti Hybrids in SLI that are OC and a 4790k on water but stock @ 4 GHz. I'm running 1080p @ 144Hz and I have 32GB RAM. I'm running Nvidia driver version 365.19. I should also mention that my rig has been a labor of love that's been a rollout upgrade since 2014.\n\nTurn off super-sampling and the stupid motion blur so you can play and drink without vomiting and I've had no issues. I ran into several issues with super-sampling and motion blur on but once that was kicked, the game is VERY enjoyable even though it needs to be tweaked. I can't honestly give this a bad review after seeing the graphics and the gameplay. Yes, there are some shortcuts taken that are obvious. However, this team spent a lot of time on this game and to me it shows. I've been able to play this maxed out (minus motion blur and super-sampling) on my 1080p @ 144Hz monitor no problem and even though the voice acting is bad according to some reviews, (BARF who cares) I like the game so far. Once into the game, it strikes me very much like Farcry 4 where you conquer territories (Philly) and upgrade weapons with the option of advancing the main mission at your leasure. I forgot to mention that the Korean voice actors seem spot on!\n\nI'm honestly not trying to come off like a ♥♥♥♥ when I say I have had no issues and I enjoy the game. I've been told that my specs make everything awesome but I assure you that is not the case on custom builds by people like me who know just enough to be dangerous to risk losing lots of money if I failed at the build. Been there, done that. Sometimes different manufacturers products hate eachother and you realize you made a bad decision...\n\nAnyway, I am the honest and dissenting voice it seems and I like this game so far and at this point I would purchase it again. I have had no crashes, no graphics issues other than mentioned, and I love the game so far.\n\nEDIT: Finished the game!! Noticed TONS of FPS issues in late game to the point where the game was not playable at ALL even on my high-end system. I closed the game enitrely and restarted but that didnt help. Only a complete reboot of my rig would allow me to continue at playable FPS. I suspect game data remains in the GRAM and RAM unless a reboot is performed or real-time data is poor and bogs down the system. I still recommend the game but wow did they waste all of that effort with extremely poor optimization. What a kick in the nuts to those hard workers... It's like building a skyscraper on a Jello foundation. Why? Just why? I also find it hard to believe that an employee did not bring up these CRUSHING PROFIT PERFORMANCE ISSUES before release. I know these issues were brought up at BETA from players but for some reason the decision was made to press on and ignore. Seriously, think of the money and accolaids that could have been had if you released a quality product instead of releasing pig vomit performance and play catch-up as you go... Also, a free upgrade of digital crap does not satisfy anybody if you CAN'T PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!","May 17","true","19.7"," 33 of 68 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","33","68","3","1"

I think its great. I can see why people are having issues running it though. I initially ran the game with maxed out settings but that got me about 30FPS. I fiddled with them a bit and have the game running a consistent 60FPS with mostly maxed settings but some turned to medium like shadows. The recommended spec is a gtx 760 and thats a joke. I have a Titan X and cant max it out.\n\nAside from the FPS problems, I think the game is awesome. I love the ambiance and setting. It feels like a first person perspective of Division. A combo of Far Cry and Dying Light. I wish more FPS shooters went the route of open world like this game did. I highly recommend this game if you can run it.

First of all I have NO ISSUES with the graphics. I am using a 750TI (stop laughing) with the latest driver and even on medium am getting no slow down that I can see.\n\nThe single player game at first feels a little on rails and with that being the biggest complaint of the original game that was scary, but once you get out of the "tutorial" it becomes much more open world and feels sorta similar to like the Gotham games and Assassins Creed in that you can run around the map doing a variety of activities and follow the story mission as you please.\n\nThe multiplayer is more similar to a game like Vermintide ... you start off in a lobby where you can customize your character and set your loadout etc .. but then you join missions in four man groups and run them. This was a tiny bit disappointing to me as I was hoping for a open world co-op campaign, but that said I loved Vermintide so I am also enjoying this. As you progress you earn money and XP to unlock skills and buy crates that have all kinds of things from guns to gear to customization opens in them.\n\nCombat feels fine to me. The guns are responsive enough and I am especially enjoying both the shotgun and marksman rifle. The cover system works well enough and theres a good enough variety of norks to keep it interesting and force you to think through encounters.\n\nOverall this was a game I was waiting for and so far I dont feel let down by it. Or at least not enough that I would recommend against its purchase. In fact I am trying to drag my friends who I played Vermintide in with me. :3","May 18","true","12.4"," 24 of 50 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","24","50","2","1"

The visuals for a torn apart city are really good and I like the stealth elements. Deep Silver's involvment is definetly noticable, as this game has a lot of similarities with Dying Light. Just substitute hordes of zombies for well trained and armed korean soldiers and instead of having a lot of melee weapons, it's a ton of guns.\n\nThe customization part is really cool but I quickly found myself using specific guns and configurations, though side jobs force you out of that by requiring so many kills with a specific weapon.\n\nHonestly, I was worried, given a lot of the initial bad reviews, and I don't think it's warranted. I can see where some people are having performance issues though, cause even on my i7/980ti rig there are some hick ups, but not during combat (whenever it autosave it pauses for a moment).

To my inevitable disappointment, there was extreemely sluggish mouse movement. This comes as no surprise given that this is a port (Fairly common issue). There was apparent mouse smoothing and mouse acceleration; which I hate with a burning passion. I searched through the settings to see if I could disable it. Aparently it's incredibly difficult to provide PC players with the ability to disable these options. Since I was desperate to effectively aim I also searched through the game folder and could not find a config file of any sort.\n\n• I also experienced many texure issues. Not missing texures or anything like that, just textures protruding through other texures. I don't know if its my high standards or not, but I found the graghics to be pretty mediocre.\n\n• The optimization seems a bit bad considering wasn't getting a consistant framerate with a GTX 980 TI on ultra in 1920x1080 (I also have 16 gigs of ddr4 ram and a 4th gen intel core i7, 3.6, just in case you might think that was the issue.)\n\nAll in all, after a very short play-time, I experienced multiple bugs (which is inevitable for a AAA day one release) and I would wait a bit to buy the game. Unless the above issues don't bother you, you should have a smooth playing experience, if you can even run the game...

The game isn't amazing but I'd say it's good, but not $60 good. It has bugs and optimizaiton problems but from my personal experience i've been able to play through it just fine without any crashes or game breaking bugs.\n\nThe game is an open world first person action adventure drama thingy that'll remind you of the easiest comparison: Far Cry. Run around in an open world freeing camps and hacking modules (basically the towers in Far Cry) to see more of whats going on- on your map. Little side events like save the prisoners or give a beggar some money. Enemy patrols driving and wandering around who you can choose to avoid or not and cause a ruckus and then flee and hide in a dumpter or a toilet. This all takes place in zones around the map and you can preform various rebelious actions that'll cause the citizens to rise up, and once you get your little riot meter to 100%, it'll become a clown fiesta and you'll get to raid enemy compounds and such to fully take back the city zone by zone.\n\nThe story isn't amazing but it's not bad as far as a shooter game goes (at least so far), and the setting is enjoyable for what it is. The coop is mission based set in semi-open maps with objectives for up to 4 players with RPGish progression (there's skill trees and gear and such, but it's all obtained from RNG loot crates you buy with in-game currency you get after completing missions). There's a $25? or so season pass with plans to release more main story and coop content.\n\ntl;dr experience so far:\n-not bad, not good, just okay\n-worth $60? no, but if you're a fan of Far Cry and such you might be interested in playing this sometime\n-some bugs and not the greatest optimization, FoV needs to be able to go past 65\n\nIf I were to score it off my current experience so far it be a 6/10, which I wouldn't consider bad.","May 18","true","4.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","0"

I decided to give it a chance, and I really don't regret in doing so, I've been having lots of fun. I'll explain briefly the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n*The atmosphere is very good, it really feels like a post apocalyptic America, the world feels real.\n*Reviews tell shooting feels generic, I disagree, weapons have recoil and don't feel like they do no damage at all, I really like the shooting. Other games have more generic shooting than this one.\n*The option to customize the weapon on the go is pretty awesome and add versatility to the game, I think it's a great idea.\n*Graphics, like face animations look awesome. There are some textures that look dull, but of the game looks like other current generation titles.\n*Lots of customization.\n*There are stealth areas that add variety.\n\nCons:\n*My specs are a i7 3770k and a gtx 980, and the  games does suffer from some technical issues, like volatile framerates and stuttering. (Keep in mind I'm playing in 2k resolution)\n*Same type of side missions and objectives (Far Cry type), so If you didn't like FC, stay away of this game. Can get repetitive.\n*The story is average at most, a lot of things are predictable.\n*Multiplayer is only Co-op (Haven't tried it yet).\n\nSo in conclussion, if you want a game with a good atmosphere and fun shooting, similar to Far Cry series, you should give Homefront The Revolution a chance, just don't expect a GOTY.","May 17","true","15.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","1"

The gunplay is not awesome. The coop works better than the campaign but there are very few missions and its get to point. defend horde, move to next point, defend horde.  The graphics and the sound work are great. The game has a ton of work to be done on optimization as 90% of the users cant play it on pc on max settings on PC's that should be able to blow the game out of the water. A streamer who runs 3 Titan X's was getting 19 fps.\n\nThe Coop is still the best part of the game. It is very similar to the Dragon Age Inquisition Multiplayer where you go on a mission. Do the SAME mission each time you play it. Get xp and reward. Use your earned money to buy crates that give you weapons, attachments, boosters, gear, and cosmetics.\n\nThe campaign is trying to be 10 different games at once that don't blend all that well together. The driving part of the game is vomit inducing. The gunplay itself is pretty bad. It feels overly clunky and it doesnt flow well at all.\n\nOn easy the mobs will fill you with bullets at times and not hurt you at all. Then the same person shooting at you will 2 shot you. It is extremely inconsistent and infuriating.  Badly designed.\n\nChances are if a person is claiming the game is great they either have bad taste, or are a hipster and like going against the grain.\n\nI will have a full review at a later date for this game on www.TheDrastikMeasure.com but at this time the game is soooo bad I can't play it in it's current state.\n\nDevs have to know the game was bad right? What is the thought process of releasing the game anyway ? The devs of the game even knew it was bad because in the credits they apologize for it and comment on it's troubled development. Was Deep Silver not willing to shell out more funding to help fix the title? Instead hey they IP will sell itself, lets rob our community ?

The weapons themselves have been fun, and the on-the-fly modding is fun. It's possible to recruit several AI followers to help you with quests, and you have to think a little bit before attempting to tackle them - it's not always possible to run in guns blazing. There's verticality in the environment that you have to use, and more than one kind of stealth that is necessary.\n\nMy main complaints would be that the enemies are capable of killing you within a few shots, which has led to a few frustrating moments where I've been sent back to square one. It's not always clear which way is the best to tackle missions and quests, but having said that, I'm still playing.\n\nI think this is a way better game than what the reviews have been saying.

If you did not like those, or you are tired of the genre, well this game is not for you.\n\nThis game is fine, if again, you're ready to accept the fact that it's basically a clone of Far Cry 3-4.\n\nRight now there is some issues with the performance and AI, but mostly with the performance.\nAI can behave strangely and impair your fun. Ex: allies by blocking the way in a corridor or moving you around when they take cover at the exact same spot as you. Ennemies could use an upgrade in AI as well (Ex; Lining up to get shot, failing to take cover or failing at dislodging you or allies out of cover, failling at flanking manoeuvres, target priorities)\n\nBetter AI would make the battles more coherent and cohesive. Improving the ennemies spawn system would also be great into that matter.\n\nPerformance is erratic even on a factory overclocked GTX 970. Expect severe frames drops and inconsistent FPS.\nHowerver it is not game breaking  just really annoying.\n\nThese are things that can be fixed in time.

First I can defintley say that doom is down right better than this. BUT, its not to say that this game is bad. It has many issues with optimization and lip syncing. But those as of now is pretty meaningless to me. Hear me out. The story is pretty lacking to say the least. but with enough beer its pretty fun. The gunplay is a bit choppy prob due to the random frame drops (its not my pc, 4770 and 2 Titans in SLI, 1440p 144hz, ussually 60-50 fps, but will drop to 20 sometimes). The gameplay is almost like far cry 3,4 (more like 3 but aspects of 4 is there) and is pretty fun for a run and gun kind of guy. the stealth is down right horrible with the frame drops, and the ai to be trolly at times, is just painful. The customization is awesome, it was the best thing in crysis if you ask me.

Now, after saying that, I have to admit that I bought my key off of ♥♥♥ for half the retail price, so IMO; The game has enough to justice my paying price of $30, but definitely doesn't hold up it's justification of being $60.\n\nAT CURRENT STATE = Date of Review 05/19/2016\n\nPROs:\n-Latest version of CryEngine 3 (Looks great in most areas).\n-Solid gameplay mechanics bundled with dedicated coop (coop is a blast with a group of good buddies).\n-Decent arsenal of weaponry at your disposal, including attachments, craftable equipment, and gear.\n-Voice acting doesn't suck nearly as bad as I assumed it would.\n\nCONs:\n-terrible optimization. Running on a GTX 980, I am only able to run most settings at 'High', even then frames bounce well between the 50s down to the 30s when there are more than a few AI on the screen (with enemy vehicles).\n-Horrible Keyboard and Mouse support. Changing certain keys will save in menu, but once exited back to gameplay, changed functions maintain default key press on top of what corresponding key that function has been assigned to.\n\nOverall: 7/10\n\nFinal Verdict: With the certain flaws this game has, it does shine with a fun coop experience even if just for a few hours at a time. I'd still recommend this game to a friend, but I'd urge getting a copy from a respectable key site for cheaper. Once patched and optimized, this game will surely be bump to a justifiable 8/10.","May 19","true","8.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

It runs around 45-60fps on high @ 1440p, so I'm happy. It has Denuvo - so what? Far Cry Primal had it, TW Warhammer has it, again, doesn't really matter to me.\n\nSo, let's talk about the game. Visually, it is quite pretty, on occasion actually REALLY pretty, the CryEngine does a really good job displaying a grim, broken city, with amazing nights and reflections, okay looking explosions, but overall believable looking effects, rain, fire and smoke,\n\nMusic and sound wise, it is a bit bland, the background music is overall a bit forgettable (as it is quite repetitive), but some of the set pieces have a really nice background. Sounds are good, weapons sound good, explosions sound fantastic, and soldiers and civilians sound great and add a lot to the atmosphere.\n\nGameplay wise - I struggled a bit. There are many cool things you can do with regards to ambushes, distractions, a couple of free-running places and lots and lots of gunfire. However on occasion it feels a bit unbalanced, but I guess that comes with an "open world" kind of feel of the areas you are operating in. Do I find it bad? No, but it could do with a bit of tightening up, if that makes sense (once you played some of the different objectives you'll know what I mean).\n\nNow, story: This is sadly the weakest point of the game, mostly because it feels a bit weak by comparison to the setting. I played the original Homefront, and while the acting was hit-and-miss, it felt more connected and pushing you forward. From what I've played so far (and admittedly, I did not finish it yet), there are a few pieces that are fantastic and show what kind of (positive / negative) impact you do to the civilians by your guerilla actions, and there is one scene where I felt properly immersed (I'm not talking about the intro), so it does have its good bits.\n\nOverall, it is a good game. It isn't a great game, but it isn't a bad game either. Considering what the game went through (publishers, starts, stops, developer changes, etc), it has its quirk and its own charme, some elements are done really well, others could have done with a bit more love, but it does feel like a worthy successor to Homefront (which I liked a lot back then). I can see myself getting my money's worth out of the single player campaign alone, and I imagine I will be enjoying some of the co-op elements for a while. Based on that, I recommend this game, I'm having a lot of fun with it, visually it is great, and I do want to finish it and try the co-op this weekend.","May 24","true","16.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It certainly is different than the first, but not necessarily in a terrible way. I don't think it is as good, but definitely does have great elements of it's own. Here is what I found:\n\n\nPROS:\n-You are not too powerful, the KPA can take you down easily if you are not careful (when faced with a part of town completely occupied by KPA, you must sabotage KPA tech and save citizens. After you've proved that the citizens can  take back whats been taken, more will join the resistance)\n- Graphics are amazing, this is probably one of the largest factors that really add play value\n- It is very exciting when you get into conflict. The mechanics work very well when fighting, again being a large factor in          play value. Plus, when any freedom fighters are near you, they'll help you.\n- Customization is unique and flexible\n- Ideas for the visuals are real atmospheric\n- You can ride motorbikes!\n- America!\n\n\n\nCONS:\n-Glitchy Textures\n- Spawning is pretty bad (units will pop up and disappear out of nowhere)\n-  Voice animations very unstable\n-   Story is not so strong (you can't really "feel" the characters)\n-    Weapons look bulky/oversized in the hands of the Ai\n-     Optimization is tricky for many people's computers apparently, but if you figure out the right settings, it'll run just fine\n-       Dramatically different from the first game(the first was awesome)\n-        Not worth the full price, if you are looking forward to it, buy it on sale\n\n\n\n"Home Is Where The War Is"","May 24","true","18.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The graphics are phenominal and the gameplay sucks you in and makes you feel part of the world.\n\nThe combat feels like organized chaos which is exactly how urban combat should feel, There are many times you will be slowly walking through a warehouse listening for your enemies while they are listening for you and then you see eachother at the same time and fast bloody firefight insues. The AI is also interesting and surpised me several times with their actions, for example there was once where I am on the street about to enter a building when an enemy soldier starts screaming at me in Korean from behind, he did not instantly shoot me... I froze and stood there for a moment while he is yelling at me with his gun up, I then quickily dart to the right into the building and right when I do so he opens fire and bullets spray the doorway I was in just moments ago.\n\nAs far as some peoples complaints about it not running well... it has Crysis 3 level of detail and graphics only in a a large open world... It is going to bring your 970 to its knees not because it is poorly built but because it is built so well... I have two 980 TIs SLI'd and ran it with everything on high in 2k with a steady 70 FPS. Just for arguments sake I turned it from 2k to 1920x1080 which is what most people are running it at and cranked everything up to very high and ran at a steady 90 FPS... I then turned it back to 2k and down to high as it looks amazing this way and runs fine. If your computer can't run it fully cranked that is fine as the game still looks amazing on high rather then very high just turn some graphics options down...

You can not compare this to the first one, since you are on the east coast this time. I do not know where in the time line this is, but if i had to guess, its a bit more in the future by maybe 2-5 years since some of the units like the drone tanks have a different apperance.\n\nThe game play is like Farcry, but in a more realistic setup, so no magic tattos or trible stuff. The weapons are very interesting, since my battle rifle can turn into a rocket launcher, or my crossbow into a flamethrower. Now I have 6 hours in, but I have only 100%'ed the first 2 zones. The story is engaging, and have the ability to instill riots (like zone 2) or able to recruit fighters to help....its pretty fun.\n\nSo far I have not noticed frame rate issues, of course i'm playing around the middle on graphics..which still looks nice. Sometimes the A.I can be dumb, but hey I've seen worse.\n\nI would recommend it for the price, however I have not played co-op, only the storyline so far, and from what I have played, I could see it being around 30 hours of game time for the SP alone.","May 17","true","18.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

I really like the guerilla like warfare, where you have to think before you act, and not just run out guns blazing. Running pretty much all settings on low and with 1360x768 (I really need to upgrade... x3) But the game still runs smoothly. Got a GTX 760 and some kind of AMD processor, don't look at me for figuring out if you'll run the game ;D\n\nOnly encountered a few problems during the first hour, like a mission wouldn't get triggered, so I had to load the last checkpoint for it to work, and when I first triggered it it was a little confusing to understand what I was supposed to do. (Might also just have been me not paying close attention, who knows) But as soon as the first mission was done, and I got my second objective, it was easier to get into, and to start to learn how things work in the city.\n\nThis review is already far too long for my short playtime, so I'll just stop here.

The mix of stealth with run and gun keeps me wanting to push on through the missions, regardless of how unlikely the plotline is.  Having read lots of poor feedback on the game and lack of mission variety i can honestly say that i have found the game to be as enjoyable as i found Far Cry 3  and Assassins Creed.  Yes it still has issues, most noticeably around the spawn in and out of enemies which can be random and which do affect continuity at times.  Having said that i would not say that this in any way detracts from the playability of the game and with the weapon variety you will find lots of ways to push through the KPA checkpoints,   THe graphics and feel of the Philadelphia setting and oppressing actions of the KPA are a great feature and I would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the FC3's of this world.\nYes it has bugs, yes it can sometimes drop frames but on a GT970 and i7 i am seeing 55 - 60 fps consistently and really enjoying it.\nMy advice:  if you are looking for a polished AAA shooter then go buy Doom.  If however you want something a bit less mindless (and challenging) then you could do a hell of a lot worse than play Homefront The Revolution.\n","May 29","true","13.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

It's got an interesting customization feature where you can change stuff on the fly. It's got the conversvion system which allows something like a pistol to become an smg. While I can see it getting tedious in the future I don't mind the hearts and mind system. It's a system where in each zone you must do things like strike points, forts, and protect the citizens. After you get to a 100 you do a couple story missions then on to the next zone. I can see how this might get repetitive to some but I enjoy it. I'm also playing on deathwish as i heard the enemies were a bit braindead. They are but playing on deathwish made me use the recruit system which basically means you can recruit resistance members, and have them fight for you. I've also heard the optimization on some specs are bad, and numerous glitches but I haven't ran into any yet. If you're looking for a city far cry this game is right up your alley.

The game is wonderful in my honest opinion. I have a R9 290x, with a i7 5820k. On default settings, I haven't dropped below 70 FPS. The voice acting i feel is a little lopsided (Important characters are louder than unimportant characters, but what game isn't like that?) The opening cutscene, the gunshots are not synced up visually to audibly. Other than that, the premise of the game, the story (so far) and the character bonding is great. I feel like people are destroying this game in the reviews WAY too early. Soon the devs will release patches to fix any issues people have with "tearing" and "hiccups". Until then, people may have to deal with a few issues, but what game doesn't have issues 10 hours into the release.\n\nAlso, it feels alot like Far Cry 3 story, and mechanic wise.\n\n\n8/10 no doubt. the -2 is only due to the sync issues i saw at the beginning cutscene.

The game world gets even more interesting when you reach the Ashgate Yellow Zone (which is the third Yellow Zone, if you include the first one you see at the start of the game). There is color and a whole different looking environment than the first couple of Yellow Zones.\n\nAnd in those fifteen hours no crashes, no glitches and most smooth 60fps gameplay. It has slowed down at times, but the only way I knew was via the Steam fps counter, otherwise I never would have even known it's was doing 60fps. And damn, it's a really pretty, very detailed game.\n\nORIGINAL REVEW: I have in just under eleven hours on the Steam version and I’m really enjoying it. It does have some rough spots, but it’s a lot of fun to play. I like open world games and Homefront scratches that itch. I think combat is a lot of fun and the modular weapon system works great and is a nice change. The plot is rather thin, but really so was the plot in Watch_Dogs and it didn’t bother me. The game map is fantastic. I don’t have any issues with the “greyness” of the Red Zones, there is a lot of color and objects around all that concrete. And there are tunnels and high catwalks and all sorts of paths to use.\n\nI do have issues trying to access some of the harder to reach locations, the game doesn’t make them easy. However the designers included a clever system of using blue paint or flags to let the player know that there really is something to find and gives hints on how to reach them.\n\nSome people have faulted the AI, but I’m finding them a challenge. They do seek cover when fired on, call in reinforcements and will flank you. And in the Yellow Zones, your stealth techniques really do get a workout.\n\nIt’s not a perfect game, but it is fun. And if it doesn’t break new ground in some areas, it’s better that the recent Assassin’s Creed games and as interesting (in a different way) as Far Cry 3 or 4. Fair warning however; it does take a good half-dozen hours before you really experience the complete gameplay.","May 18","true","18.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I understand that ther was quite a bit of trading hands over the lifetime of this game's developement, and im happy that it didn't turn out to be an utter mess. The story was greatly elongated and completely unique compared to the successor, which i consider a plus.\n\nIn the end, there are no other games quite like it, and i cant stress how refreshing the story was compared to the "find enemy, shoot enemt, win" monotony of most games these days.

There are a few bugs and some features aren't as fleshed out as they should have been, but none of it is gamebreaking and it won't severely affect your enjoyment of what is ultimately quite an engaging experience.\n\nThe combat is as good as any other AAA FPS, the environments/level design is gorgeous and varied, and the exploration is very fun. The devs have obviously put a lot of passion and work into this project, and through no fault of their own it's been hampered by studio bankrupcy and a slashed budget. Despite this, the game still shines and is very fun to play. A lot of effort seems to have been put into reducing the repetitiveness, preventing the player from getting bored. I'm about 10 hours in and I'm not getting that familiar dragging bored feeling I usually get when playing open world FPS's.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like Just Cause, Dead Island, Red Faction Guerilla, and Far Cry, you'll definitely like Homefront: The Revolution.

The game is basically FarCry in an urban environment, and I like it just as much. However, the technical issues does take me out of it some what.\n\nThe game lacks polish, and it shows. When you climb over objects, your camera snaps in a weird angle after climbing over the ledge, not at all smooth like Dying Light or FarCry. Sometimes when you reload the magazine moves faster than your gun which creates a hilarious effect of you using the Force to reload. There's still plenty of other technical problems, such as the stuttering and graphical anomalies, but these were the little things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most (for whatever reason). All it takes is an NPC's mouth moving slightly off sync from the voice to take you out of a game, and it only gets worse when there's a lot of little things nagging at you at once.\n\nMaybe wait for a patch before buying, but behind all technical issues lies a competant shooter. It isn't breaking any new ground, but If a competent shooter is all that you're looking for you might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nIf you want to play a similar game, like, RIGHT NOW, go buy FarCry 3/4.\n","May 18","true","16.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Of course you wouldn't recommend a game that doesn't work, but that unfair in the overall review percentage for those of us that actually played the game with ok framerate.\n\nThere's a number of techinal issues with this game, but so have a lot of games, and there's not (for me in any case) enough of them to ruin the game. The overall gameplay and visual style is really good, and if you like Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4, there's not really any good reason why you wouldn't like this as well (provided you can actually run the game).\n\nThe story is boring and uninteresting, but so were all the Far Cry games and I don't think the story is the point in this one. As good as no multiplayer game ever had a story, but since a story isn't expected, no one cares. This game is about looting for cash to upgrade and taking over bases and absorbing the post-apocalyptic landscape and atmosphere.\n\nI see people dislike the game for being repetetive, but I can't really remember any open world game that wasn't.  If you like what you're playing, repetetiveness isn't negative - you just want more of the game. If you don't like the game to begin with, then of course the repetetiveness is like walking though Hell.\n\nThe game really feels like a Fallout reskin of Far Cry 4 (with a dash of Dying Light), and that's more than good enough for me, even with the technical issues and silly AI.\n\nThe mixed reviews is really unfair, it's a good game if you take it for what it is - a postapocalyptic FPS shooter with some minor RPG in it. And it even has a coop mode with characters and levels (although I haven't gotten around to that yet).  People tend to complain that the game is short. I'm well over 30 hours and I'm not finished yet, although I do everything there is to do. I also don't rush trough on easy. I recommend playing at Deathwish difficulty to make the game last and to have an actual challenge.\n\nI'll leave you off with a 7/10 rusty nails and a warning: It's not really open world, it's just not linear; the levels are big and square instead of straight - that way you can choose your own entry points when taking out bases.","May 28","true","39.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

And the game is just....Solid. Its not that great and its not that good. I have played for about 8 hours and cleared about half of the game. While the game is advertized as an open world game, it is actually more like open world segments that you can fast travel to and from. The story is pretty standard as fps games go. The characters are not that great, and your player character is silent. You take outposts held by the KPA and earn money for new attachments, weapons and gear to improve your silent character. Honestly it feels alot like Farcry,but with a slight post-invasion like feel. The graphics are quite nice on a GTX 960, and i dont really have any really bad bugs to talk about. Ign posted saying enemies just popping in, Ive never had that problem.\nAs stated before the game is nothing to write home about. I was very stoked for this game when it was revealed, but now i am slightly dissapointed by the final product. The game is still fun with all of its weapon customization and solid fps gameplay, but the story is lacking. I was also dissapointed by the fact that there is no competitive multiplayer, however there is a coop mode but there is only about 6 missions that you can do as of now. And there not very intresting to say the least.\n\nOverall i give the game a 6/10\nIm only recommending because there is no "Meh" option. I am enjoying the game thus far but its just a solid game. Ill play it for maybe another 15-20 hours then uninstall and let it sit in my library.","May 17","true","9.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

It forces you to realize that you're not some COD badass, you're just some idiot with a gun and something to fight for.\n-The game areas change as you play. It's amazing to see this pro-KPA zone full of collaborators and such go and turn to rioting and uprising against the KPA because of your actions.\n-The guns feel real. They look heavy and slightly bulky because IRL they are heavy and bulky. You're character acts like they're heavy and bulky and this affects your ability to fight with them.\n-The strike areas and strongholds are each unique and different-- no one location mirrors the next. Sure, each relief center or whatever will have similar goals to capture it, but the layouts between them make each location unique.\n-The journal entries and other textual documents are actually really interesting and fill in a lot of the backstory.\n-The open world is legitimately open. You have your missions, but there are numerous side objectives to make your journey easier. Even how you complete your objective is up to you. For example, if the game wants me to capture a stronghold, I have a couple options. Do I use my RC car, attach a hacking device to it and hack open the gate? Do I set charges on cooling vents and blow a hole in the wall? Do I grab a motorcycle, find a ramp and jump the wall? Once I'm inside, do I go COD style, pull out my LMG and mow everyone down, or do I move quietly through, killing when I have to and biding my time? Of course there are many more options than this, but you get the idea. To be honest, different areas require different methods to succeed.\n\nCONS:\n-Occasionally during scripted scenes, and especially during the opening scene, the audio won't match up with the video. It's more annoying than anything else.\n-The "Hearts and Minds" missions are fairly repetitive. These missions are where you're trying to get the people in one of the zones to rise up and fight the KPA. The results of the missions are generally different, but the mission itself is the same.\n-The motorcycles and RC cars are difficult to navigate. The accelerate too quickly and get stuck really easily.\n-Once you get into your rhythm with your weapons, there's no need to buy the others. This can happen fairly early on in the game.\n-The AI is sometimes inconsistent, i.e. when they'll spot you and when they won't, etc etc.","May 20","true","51.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

I won't say that everyone else reviewing the game is wrong or lying, but personally I didn't experience a single performance issue and I'm running on a pretty old graphics card on medium, solid 40fps.\n\nThe story wasn't great, rather boring actually, but the gameplay was absolutely brilliant. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3 or 4 then it's likely you will like how this game handles as it's very similar, just a little more clunky.\n\nThis is definitely a game you rather hate or love, and I loved running around the street of Philly shooting up soliders for the resistance, and the weapon customisation was very helpful for changing up your gameplay on the run. Plus who doesn't love a shotgun that fires bloody incendiary grenades?\n\nDon't buy this game for it's story, it's mediocre.

But this games development was not a simple A to B as it were. The game went all over the shop, loss of funding and time wasted. Am sure if it went from A to B then this game would actually be alot better.\n\nGameplay is similar to far 3 and 4, + crysis games. But you take alot more damage.\nYou will die alot till you get used to the game.\nA.I is actually difficult in some spots and in certain zones always think twice.(AI can hunt you down which is nice for once)\nThe cry engine again shows good graphics.\nWeapon customization on the go is good and crafting (If only you could craft a dam health kit)\n\nThe first part the performance is not great even with the settings on high i was getting 35-45fps. after 2mins after that i get 58-60s+ on high settings. There is some windows that you have trouble entering which is annoying. But you get that with mosts games.\n\nI am playing on medium difficulty at the moment and still the A.I fights of friendly and enemies are for the most part ok. Some areas are bad they do little damage to each other, other times the A.I are just insane. e.g A friendly A.I takes out a patrol and a car then some reason follows you around( i Didn't ask it to)  Darn that A.I survived a long time and i died less times because of it.\n\nMaps are big but fails to deliver the full open world exp of a much larger map then sections.\nThe bike can be annoying at times. but just get use to it\nNo change to the gameplay as it progresses or change to the phone thingy task\n\nI encounted not many problems throughout playing this game, ok theres certain places are better then others. but no harmfull bug's stopping gameplay or missions. just my poor skills at being stealth.\nChanging keys works fine for me no problems and i swopped wasd for tfgh to try it out for a bit.\n\nlast this thing, one of the best easter eggs i have ever come across.and works fine.","May 29","true","29.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

While fun to play it feels like it needed another month or so of play-testing before release.\n\n(For reference, I'm running an i5 3770k with two 660Ti in SLI, on lowest settings it was perfectly playable, anything higher gave input lag of up to .5 seconds.  FPS was constant except for ~.5 second freezes when saving, which were never at bad times.)\n\nLong Version:\n\nPros;\n-Fun map to explore\n-Beautiful environments\n-The weapon customization system gives you options, and due to the time it takes to change the weapons it asks the player to think about the combat situation before entering it\n-Dodging between buildings in a "red" zone while avoiding Nork patrols and the Airships (robot sky whales, no, really) is very fun\n-Moving through an occupied "yellow" zone while dodging patrols and cameras is also fun\n-Seeing the "effect" that the player character has on the environment is nice.  It goes from dodging patrols and hiding to walking down the middle of the road over the course of liberating a zone.\n\nCons:\n-Very mediocre voice acting\n-Unoriginal/predictable characters and plot\n-Rare minor graphics glitches (a few people floating 1-2ft off the ground, etc)\n-Variable AI, sometimes dumb sometimes ok.  The flying drone AIs were very poor and would sometimes try to fly into a building and get stuck or run into walls and explode, but to be fair I've worked with real life drone autopilots and our real world ones aren't much better.\n-The motorbike is super glitchy and not very useful in the environment.  I found several bikes embedded in objects and died twice just getting off the bike.\n\nOverall: I liked the game.  The story and characters were meh but the fun of running through the city and liberating the zones was why I got it, and for me it was worth it.  The glitches were never game breaking and easy for me, at least, to overlook.  I'm ok with the $60 price tag since I got much more play time from this than a call of duty title (I mostly do single player stuff), but it's up to you if you want to wait for a sale or not.","May 24","true","21.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You can't spray down enemies in this game because it is pretty hard, even on the lowest of difficulty because they're making it realistic. It's also a very nice game because you get to make your own choices on what you would like to do. You can follow the main story line or it can be like Assassin's Creed: Sydnicate because you can recruit people in the Resistance to follow you and you get to take down enemy strongholds that are not actually part of the story, which adds more gameplay time to play.

Also it is a sandbox game so I can enjoy shooting Norks or sneaking around like a ghost.\n\nPros\n-Attractive setting\n-Sandbox with enough elements\n-Converting different weapons\n-Shooting Norks\n\nCons\n-Drops of fps in some places\n-Shooting is not as great as common FPS\n-Some repeating elements\n\nBuy it, but you can wait for steam sales","May 20","true","32.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

The game is finally released and the first 25 minutes is just cutscene (to be expected from any singleplayer game) then the first few minutes of gameplay are awesome. Ultra graphics settings and 60fps in a very rich enviroment full of people. I get out into the actual game and struggled to keep 45fps on a pretty nice rig. The "open-world" aspect was bland and had no story to it at all. I got on a motorcycle and tried to drive it, but that didn't really work. The camera angle was always off and I would crash within seconds. Inside of this bland story-less game even on normal difficulty were hundreds of drones and soldiers that killed me pretty quick. It got to the point where I wondered why I was even torturing myself with this brutal terrible gameplay and 30 fps. I then realized that there is no point because there is no story. If the entire game was like the beginning part of the game it would have been amazing, but it wasn't. I refunded this game as quickly as a I could. Extremely disappointed.","May 17","false","0.9"," 28 of 59 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","28","59","0","2"

Being a PC enthusiast and having a monster of a PC I have only experience a few minor graphical glitches  in 6+ hours.  I did drop below 60 fps (my monitor is a 144hz monitor) a  few times but remained in the solid 85fps area through most of gameplay.\n\nWhen you complete a Side Job like take a picture of the police station you will notice a quick lag spike as the game awards you your money and auto saves, but mostly smooth sailing.\n\nThe only actual non-technical gameplay complaint I have is the automatic weapons in the game seem underwhelming while any single shot weapon (except the starter pistol) are great.  When you upgrade the starter pistol to a SMG that is the only automatic weapon in the game that feels crisp.  The AR and LMG variant act slow and are very inacurate.  The Battlerifle and Crossbow seem to be where it is at so far.\n\nI would recommend this game if you like the story idea as it puts you right in the feel of the game.  Personally I enjoyed the original in all aspects.  The open area idea in this one is good and I hope they can flesh it out someday in a true sequel as they have some good ideas here.","May 17","true","10.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I have a gtx 970 and had to turn a few things from ultra to high, but it runs smoothly for me. Graphics are great, aside from the dated looking npcs. The world is immersive af. Gunplay feels very gritty with every bullet that hits an enemy making them jolt. Story kinda sucks so far, but you love to hate the enemy in this game, thus wanting to just go around and take out every post of theirs. I should also note that this game is NOT easy. You die quickly and guns have quite a bit of recoil. Cover is a must, and you must always watch your back, because although the AI can be dumb af sometimes, it also will flank and get a nice surround on you. But it is a good and welcome challenge, unlike Farcry where you just blow everything up and then wingsuit away like ♥♥♥♥in batman.\n\nIt must be noted though that there are numerous SOUND glitches, with some physical bugs as well. But the sound glitches are pretty bad at times.\n\nBut if you can get over the bugs, which is totally possible with this game, and want a farcry game but with that feeling like you are actually making a difference along the way, then don't let the negative reviews turn you away. Just make sure you have a good rig, because it is demanding.","May 28","true","8.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There are also some quality historical echoes involved with being a freedom fighter against a foreign power in Philadelphia amongst the twists in the story arc.\n\nIt is less an open world shooter then it is a single path shooter with some extra areas to explore. I find that to be different enough from the mainstream games to be fresh. The graphics are top notch as well and I have had 0 issues with optimization. The only drawback as with many open world games is not all the terrain is smooth to operate on and there are some platform aspects that do not carry over so well.\n\nThe voice acting? I grew up around Philly and I gotta say. The voice actors they chose are top notch. These people sound exactly like I would imagine the Philadelphian resistance to sound like. Gun nut philosopies and all. Even the dirt bikes fit the theme of Philly although I wish they were actually useful and controllable.\n\nEnemy AI is bad and the endless spawn in the open map is annoying. If you kill them fast enough and get cover away from the airships though, you're golden. A silenced pistol and skill with the crossbow are your friends. You will also learn to run away from your ambushes quickly .... that part is very realistic and I believe that to be their goal. This isnt a Rambo game. This isn't DOOM. You have to plan a bit before the shooting starts. Fortunately the AI is predictable and planning can be done with a minimal amount of scouting.\n\nOverall. This game is getting a bad rap. For what exactly? idk. I've played many games with overall positive reviews and worse mechanics/coding.\n\nThis isn't The Division or Far Cry or DOOM. Apples and Oranges. It is a bit of everything and a little bit of the original Assassins Creed too.","May 27","true","39.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you can look past the terrible story line and the poor graphics optimisation the game is fun, the open world combat is good, and weapon customisation is nice. I wish there was more weapons though.  It can be challenging at times which is good because most shooters these days such as BF4 and COD are just not challenging enough.  Being able to recruit soldiers to fight with you is good aswell.\nI don't recommend paying full price for this game as there are better games out at the moment for the same price.

The game punishes you for going guns blazing and you often have to retreat in fights. I also like the difference in gameplay between the red and yellow zones.

I have AMD FX 8350, 8 giga RAM DDR4, ATI Card 4 Giga.\nAlso the AI BOT are quite good (at hard difficulty): they search for you in the zone if the spot you, they jump on building roofs (!), and also take cover, and start to shoot from far distance.\nSometimes there is an AI bot bottleneck into bulding: they all come from the same door, you shoot and eliminate them all of them, they were 4 bots (but it happened only once).\nYou can also engage allied AI bots, max 4 people, they automatically follow you: they essentially cover you when you advance.\nEventually you also have to reach rooftoops, searching fo the right path (such as liberating tower in far cry). Nice "mini-game".\nSo all in all, as the game is now patched, it is fun to play.\nThe game style is a mix of far cry 2, far cry 4, metro last light, original homefront 1 (the setting).\nAt last: Coop gameplay.

I was pretty surprised after hearing the Internet rabble prior to playing, so I was happy to see I wasnt one of those affected by tech problems.... But then I started playing, and I kind of have to end It there on the "good".\n\nBecause thats really the best I can say about this particular game. And even completely maxed out (At 1080) It still looks a bit dated at best, unimpressive for a game that released this year; maybe If it were a few years ago...\nThis game immediatly reminded me of Metro (Take your pick) In Its gameplay and mechanics, and thats not really a good thing -- Granted both Metro's were, and are awesome games; like I said -- dated.  Everything just feels "off", even hopping over obsicles, or just walking/running looks weird and jerky.\n\nThe story and characters were pretty forgettable (IMO) for my short time, & after my small hour or so Ingame I was not willing at all to push past that 2 hour mark to "see If It gets better".\n\nAll In all; I simply did not enjoy this game, and I wanted to.","May 18","false","1.0"," 26 of 55 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","26","55","0","3"

Full review once i finish it.\nNote: I will complain about the few bugs and a little bit about Optimization in here, but i won't make these things go into a lower score for the game.\n\nHomefront The Revolution is a open world first-person shooter developed by Dambuster Studios and published by Deep Silver. Now, let me begin. I know a lot of people will hate me for this, but it's my opinion anyway. It's a really, really fun game. I really liked the combat and gameplay mechanics. There are zones, these of which are open world maps on their own, and you can switch back to which one of them you wan't to go to. The only ones i have currently seen are: Red and Yellow Zones. Red Zones are restricted for any civilian access, while Yellow Zones are High Security zones. At those zones, as we are one of the members of the Resistance, they will recognize us and hunt us down. We can hide, take down cameras and all, but to make those areas actually fun to play is making Hearts and Minds. Hearts and Minds are pretty much things to make the resistance and revolution stronger, and doing that in Yellow Zones is essential for fun, as the Yellow Zones when you don't have 100% Hearts and Minds, it's really, REALLY boring. The game did not run so badly at my PC, but surely it did have some times when frame-rates were from 65 to 5 FPS. The game sometimes freezes, but it's really rare for me, as the only times it froze was to save the game's settings, loadouts and checkpoints. Enemies at first rarely got stuck into geometry, but now it happens a lot. It doesn't happen so often, but it's a normal amount. Meanwhile, the game barely has health regeneration, which is good in my opinion, as it pumps the game's difficulty, and it makes buying or looking for, specially finding Health Kits around the map extremely essential. I haven't played much of the Coop, but it was fun playing it anyway. There aren't many weapons, there are conversions and a lot of customization. Sure, there isn't so much to change, but it's still a pretty good variety, and the detail put into the process of customization is pretty high. Red Zones, are extremely fun to play, even if it should be easy as the Resistance is stronger in them, it's still pretty hard to survive for a long time. The soundtrack is also very, very good.\n\n\nCurrent Score (Not Final Score): 8.5/10 ~It's fun as hell!","June 1","true","51.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I understand that it sucks you can't play the game right now, but you cant just base your review off of that either.\n\nFor those saying the weapon handling isnt that great well think of it this way, you are an ordinary citizen with no prior training who decided to join the uprising. Ofcourse you arnt going to have the perfect aim and your weapon will sway alot, you can fix those by upgrading your weapons over time.\n\nI like the fact that this game doesn't have a grinding system like the division, meaning I don't have to first become like a level 30 to do certain missions and things like that.\n\nI think this game could be great after several patches fixing some of its issues. You should also trust your gut rather than other peoples reviews for this game and try it for yourself.

The story is a fantastic idea, dare I'd say fantastical, and the voice acting is superb. The sounds are fine and the gun mechanics are fine (for someone who mostly just buys CoD or Battlefield for it's campaign.\n\nWhere it lacks, though, is just the technical side. With a 65 Field of Vision lock my nausea kicked in almost 15 minutes in. I was sick to my stomach and everything I did from turning off background processes to disabling an entire secondary display did nothing to aid my growing physical sickness. To add salt to my wounds the FPS lock of 30, while I don't really care wholeheartily, no doubt added to my sick feeling.\n\nNow add in the fact the loading screens lock up for 15 minutes or more and in the middle of combat awful blurry lag spikes seal your fate and normally if a scanner UAV sees you from afar the game poops on itself attempting to render th elong-ranged detection. I would not recommend buying the game in it's current state, but I would recommend keeping an eye on it. Maybe an optimisation patch will come out in a week or month. Perhaps I'll re-purchase it at a later time when it's cheaper and wont cause my brain to flip upside-down.\n\nFor the sake of TL;DR, I'd give it a 6/10. I had fun playing what I could before actually becoming sick, and it is a fantastic story just like the first. All-in-all, don't buy it yet, but at least buy it later if/when it's improved technically.","May 17","true","3.5"," 24 of 51 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","24","51","2","0"

That being said, the water beneath it was highly acidic, and here's why.\n\nThe lag is real. The game engine itself is my biggest complaint, since I can't even really play the game due to it. There's lag, and tons of gigantic black splotches on the screen that decide to obscure my line of fire at just the wrong moments, so that in tandem with lag and shaking around forces me to wildfire towards the Koreans, and absolutely forces me to avoid stealth gameplay, which ironically is the whole focus of this. It probably doesn't help that you move like Buzz Lightyear, blasting off all over the place when that isn't your intent.\n\nThe graphics in Alien: Isolation are far better than this, and A:I came out about 2 years ago; Isolation runs smoother than snow on a mountain in a Bob Ross painting, and it has phenomonally good graphics, and IT is (sort of) an open world experience, so there's absolutely no excuse for there to be such abominable lag.","May 17","false","1.2"," 72 of 149 people (48%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","48","72","149","16","8"

Right off the bat, I knew something was horribly, TERRIBLY wrong with this game. But, I guess that's just what I get for thinking that the sequel to the most mediocre game in history was actually going to be worth a damn.\n\nFor starters, the enemy AI is stupid beyond reason. Most of the time playing had them running into walls, shooting in the wrong direction, clipping through objects, or shooting one way while the bullets go another. I haven't seen AI this bad since RIde to Hell: Retribution. Frankly, though, this isn't much better than RTH, anyway.\n\nThe writing is some of the most incompetent ♥♥♥♥ I've ever witnessed. Every line of dialogue was cringe-worthy, every character a shell, every NPC an idiot. I thought Halo 5 had writing, but this is straight up incompetent on every level. The mission design is lazy, simple Point A - Point B run and gun shooting, taking buildings, "talking" to NPC's, and after you claim a new stronghold, it immediately is decked out with American flags and sprawling with rebels. It's so jarring that I actually thought I was teleported to a different area of the map on several occassions. On one occassion, I had to take a stronghold with a Korean tank inside. The tank, out of nowhere, exploded, without any warning or reason whatsoever.\n\nKill me now. Please, put me out of my misery!\n\nThe multiplayer is an absolute joke. A series of co-op missions (of which encompass and grand total of TWO GAME MODES!) have you do the same exact things you were already doing in the campaign. The absurd nature of the plot does nothing to assist in the game's setting, the player customisation is an absolute joke, your body clips through objects incessantly, friendly NPC's clip through objects even more, and the freezes and stuttering in this game is ABYSMAL. I can run just about every modern game on Ultra and still pull off 45+ FPS (depending on how demanding the game is), so it's absolutely unnacceptable that this game, on MEDIUM SETTINGS, still freezes constantly. Movement is jerky and awkward, the gunplay is hit or miss, and half of the objectives in the game don't even work!\n\nSeriously, no joke, at the beginning of the game, you have to set off a trap that includes explosive barrels. You have to simply press a button to detach the barrels and have them fall on the North Koreans and blow them up. One of the barrels (I couldn't make this ♥♥♥♥ up if I tried) actually got stuck, and it blew me up instead.\n\nThis is the ♥♥♥♥ing travesty of a game that this abortion of a company delivered.\n\nI don't know why it happened, but Crytek apparently sold the rights to this game to some other developer I've never heard of, and it's clear that they have NO CLUE how to make a game. Do not play this. Do not rent it, do not purchase it, do not borrow it. It is the worst FPS I've played in years. This makes the last Homefront game look like a masterpiece. I actually enjoyed Major\Minor, the dumbest game of all time, more than this game.

The storyline is action packed mixed in with some touchy moments. This game, I will say, is NOT call of duty. You cannot just run and gun the whole thing, even on the lowest difficulty setting. This game puts you in the role of a resistance fighter, not a soldier, and as such you fight in the style of guerilla warfare. You will need to run away sometimes but that's what they were going for.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous and have very little loading screens, however as a result there are some frame rate drops which I hope they can address, all in all very minor. The cut scenes are brilliantly animated, hats off for that as well.\n\nWith a few patches I'd give this game an 8/10, but for now I'll give it a 7/10, which for a game that has been in developmental hell for the better part of 5 years I say is fantastic.\n\nAlso just as small note I have not played Coop yet.

I can't comment on the lack of optimization or anything like that because that's just not happening to me.\n\nWith that being said, this feels like a pretty solid game.\n\nFirst, the gunplay is delicious. When you pop off the perfect headshot, it feels oh so satisfying, and the takedown animations are crisp and pretty brutal. I like it. The gunplay reminds me quite a bit of Far Cry 3 and 4, so if that's your thing, you'll love it.\n\nFrom what I can see so far, the open world is pretty solid, too. There's plenty to do and plenty to collect, so it seems like if you complete the main campaign there's gonna be quite a bit for you to do after. It's less than other classic modern open world titles like the Elder Scrolls series or GTA, but there's quite a bit of content here in this world, probably around the level of say Sleeping Dogs.\n\nWith that being said, there are a few negatives, specifically a really weak story. The original Homefront's set up for the invasion made a lot more sense, and even that backstory was a tough pill to swallow. The atmosphere the game sets up, especially when it's night time, in the suburbs of Philadelphia of occupation is pretty nice, but when you enter a redzone that tension goes away. The characters are also pretty B+ too and the main story missions are subpar. However, the gameplay makes traveling to them nice.\n\nAll in all, it's a solid game. Do I give it a 10/10?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/223100/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","There were a few big surprises in store for me when I first started this game. The first surprise was that the FOV slider was terrible and only ranges from 40 to 65, and the highest you can go through configs seems to be 90. The second was that despite what I thought, this isn't actually Homefront 2.\n\nThe first Homefront was flawed, but interesting. It took a semi-plausible story of a unified Korea becoming a global power and invading the US, and while the game wasn't great the presentation was on-point, using a mix of out-of-context real news clips, fictional newspapers detailing the various fallings of the US infastructure during the invasion, and the use of real-world brands as stores and locations. There were moments where you were able to stop shooting and listen to civilians in their encampments, and most of the time they only had criticism to offer because of the KPA's retaliation efforts to the resistance, taking away the "you're the hero" feeling that other shooters like Call of Duty tend to revel in. It all gave the game a uniquely realistic approach that I haven't seen in any other game. It was unfortunate that the main supporting character was an unlikeable dork and the gameplay was the bog standard CoD shooting, and so it was forgotten until now - or so I thought. Homefront: The Revolution actually seems to have forgotten the original entirely, and the backstory has been completely rewritten into a generic mess that depicts North Korea just kind of magically becoming the new Apple and even arming the entire US army before using a deactivator chip that they stole from Black Ops 2 to disable our military, and so it begins from there.\n\nAs you've probably seen from the other reviews, the game is fairly buggy. It doesn't always run well, and even when it does run well seemingly random things will eagerly tank your framerate, like looking at a burning car. The AI is terrible, and the only reason they have any chance of killing you is because they seem to respawn constantly. If you die, you reload at a checkpoint, but the ammo and medkits you used don't get restored, and I'm still not sure if it's a glitch or intentional. You'll no doubt run into various other bugs that I didn't, but suffice to say the game could use some work.\n\nWith that being said, if it does run, it's not bad, and that's the only reason I'm recommending it positively. It's essentially an offspring of modern Far Cry games, and with that you can pretty much tell what to expect - taking on outposts, stealth that doesn't always work, exploring for caches, equipment and upgrades, etc. There are other new features, like parts where you have to work in a particular city area to rally the public to fight against the KPA, but for the most part it plays it relatively safe, and I'm okay with that. The two weapon limit is used interestingly in that your character is apparently a gun wizard and can change guns into entirely different guns by swapping everything except the handle out on the fly, so your pistol is also an SMG and a pneumatic launcher while your assault rifle can be an LMG or a grenade launcher at any moment. There's also 2 full Timesplitters 2 levels in it for you to play, for those of you who are familiar with Free Radical's older games.\n\nI'd recommend waiting on this game if you get it at all in case it doesn't run for you as well as it does for me, but it's all around pretty decent. The story still feels a bit rushed and anticlimactic just like the first game, but it's passable and doesn't detract from the entertainment. Even though the game plays it safe and ultimately still copies another game, they at least picked a good one to copy this time, and differentiated it enough to keep things from being stale. I'm sure for now there are better games you could get, but Homefront not-2 isn't a terrible choice either.","May 19","true","20.1"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","12","27","0","0"

I'm on a laptop, and was apparently the most popular Steam Streamer for a while - While playing this game.\n\nSo,  even with the graphics at max, i get no studdering or frame rate issues. Which really makes me think it's not the games optimization. but the people's systems who are complaining about said optimization.\n\nThe game itself, so far seems like a great sequel - though I don't actually know if it's even directly related to the original homefront. The game is a Red-Dawn story being told in a game format which is very exciting. Especially when set at the most difficult difficultly, it makes you play the game much more stealthy-guerilla warfare-y or you'll die a lot. It seems like the AI really know what they're doing and how to respond to you for the most part.\n\nI don't know much about the multiplayer, but as soon as a friend gets the game and plays it with me. I'll update on my thoughts on the game.\n\nAlso It's midnight and I just worked a lot. So I'll probably edit this thing tomorrow or the next day to word it better.","May 17","true","8.4"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","11","25","2","10"

I can understand why people are upset about the optimization of this game, but I will give my thoughts and what I have experienced so far in Homefront: The Revolution.\n\nSettings and Computer specs:For me I have the settings at max, and according to fraps I am getting between 65-70 fps.\nCPU: i7-5820k\n32GB DDR4 Ram\nEVGA GeForce GTX 980Ti\nGameplay: The combat can seem clunky at first and the guns are inaccurate, but look at it like this. The person you are playing as never shot a gun before (From what we know), so most people will not be able to be perfectly accurate like trained soldiers or anyone that used a gun before. The bike that I tried out for a short while before I ditched it to go on foot since it seemed to be safer and quieter. Other than those, I do like it that you can do the weapon customizations like turn a pistol into a smg and a rifle into a LMG/gernade launcher.\n\nConclusion:For me I think this game can be a lot of fun for me once I put the time and effort into it. For others who don't have as beefy of a computer as I do may want to wait a bit till they optimize it better for PC. If people are doubting that I get that FPS than I can always get a screenshot and edit my review with it.","May 17","true","8.0"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","10","23","2","0"

If you're not sure about buying this, just wait unti a patch is released.  I have a 6700k with a 980ti and I haven't had significant problems, though the game isn't optimized well and has fps drops.  There have also been a number of bugs in shadows, hand motions freezing, sounds not matching with voices/guns, and textures not rendering.  It's not as bad as Arkham or Unity as others are comparing it, but is suffering from bugs that are annoying.\n\nAs far as gameplay is concerned, it feels like a lesser version of FC.  The gunplay isn't 'addicting' as FC, but is satisfactory though it takes some getting used to.\nDon't know enough about the story to weigh in on that, yet.  One problem with the game is its release date.  There are many games releasing this same month that are FPS and that are significantly better (gameplay wise).  It's a hard sell, honestly.\n\nWould I recommend it....Yea-no. Honestly, I'm up in the air.  I'll wait until I play it more and a patch comes around.

According to some reviews, it’s not a direct sequel to anything. The story is pretty easy to follow, we’re treated with a short but sweet intro sequence that tells us that the North Koreans had been selling the USA technology for decades… But when it came time to pay up, the US was in debt and collapsed… So they just moved right in and took over the country in payment. Since most of their tech was purchased from them, they were evidently able to shut down most, if not all defenses the US had.\nHonestly that’s probably a better explanation than most military shooters these days. Homefront went back decades to set up the downfall rather than the quick “Suddenly the russians are here” or “some PMC did a successful power-grab and owns ALL THE GUNS”.\nAt the very least, it does a good job of properly suspending my disbelief. The intro does a whole timeline starting from the 1970′s with a voiceover describing how everything slowly went to hell for us during the next 50 years. Fair enough.\n\nReviews are “Mixed”, however most of them talk about bad optimization and how the game barely runs… That ceased to be an issue for me a couple months ago when I upgraded. As a result, Homefront runs fine. The occasional FPS drop, and even that went away once I tweaked my graphics settings - Most of which are on High (Though not on Very High).\n\nMechanically, the game has its ups and downs. It’s a sort of psuedo-open world that is comparable to the Far Cry series. Indeed, one could sum this game up with “Like Far Cry? Play this”, because it’s the usual tower/base/zone control where you assault a stronghold or radio and that zone suddenly gets littered with resistance fighters, which in turn, helps you traverse the area a little more safely.\nI say “psuedo” because there’s not a whole hell of a lot to do while running between base-controls. Every now and then a dynamic event pops up (Such as five snipers pinning down a squad), wherein you get some money and resources for completing it but they’re skippable if you have your sights on a mission - which gives you a lot more money and resources.\n\nThere’s only one mechanic so far that I despise - Driving. There are bikes littered throughout the zones and sometimes you need to take it into a building and park it on a sort of wheel-generator, hold down forward for a bit to “charge” a generator, then you’ve captured the base. The problem is, as it kind of was with Far Cry, is that vehicle driving in first person is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥. I tap D and it turns a full 45 degree angle when I’m just trying to inch away from some rubble. At least Far Cry gave you a large open world with fields - This is Philadelphia. There’s rubble EVERYWHERE. In my six hours of gametime I’ve yet to go thirty feet without ramming straight into something. So I'm screwed if there’s ever a mission where I have to drive one through a siege.\n\nSo far that’s been my only source of annoyance. A less annoying but still irritating issue, some of the bases are hidden in buildings where you have to find a secret ‘entrance’ in order to get into it. I’ve had to resort to youtube and walkthroughs twice to directly point me to where I need to go because I once spent ten minutes circling a building and climbing around the stairs, only to find out there was some blue paint on a bookcase that I never even saw. I walked by that bookcase a dozen times but that damn paint was never in my field of vision.\nI also left a safehouse to be stuck in the “leaving” animation, where a Korean shotgunner was right there unloading into me. Some safehouse, right?\nBeyond that, I’ve run into a couple of bugs but nothing has been directly gamebreaking, except one broken base that I can’t control… Hopefully restarting the game will have fixed that.\n\nSo I’ll just sum up with “Like Far Cry? Are you a 100%-er? Then you probably won’t mind this.”","May 20","true","8.4"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","0"

Ahh, that's the golden goose in a fps isn't it? They are a riot. Everything is upgradeable and interchangeable on the fly. Your pistol can act as a silenced air powered assassin tool, a 9mm handgun, AND a .45 cal smg. You don't need to be at a workbench to change them up, you can do it during battle. Like your shotgun? Who dosen't, right? Well now you can turn it into a napalm launcher once you buy the upgrade. The versatility of weapons reminds me of the Resistance franchise on PS3 (which was known for it's insane weapons).\nHows the sound? I'm not a huge sound critic but everything sounds balanced\nHow does it look? One of the best I've seen\nHow is the story? As I said, i'm not far in.

I'm on a GTX 770 and I'm playing on high without any issues. The only time it stutters for a few seconds is when the game autosaves which if no one has noticed, a few other games do that too\n\nPersonally I like the game, I think fighting against a stronger opposittion using hit and run tactics is enjoyable and you're prone to dying a lot, even on medium difficulty.\n\nWeapon customisation is pretty badass, especially as you can see things being changed physically in front of your eyes.\n\nYou've got two different zones in the game, Yellow zones and red zones. Yellow Zones are heavily policed and are filled with civilians and security. Yellow zones are you living and breathing occupied neighbourhoods where stealth and planning is more prone.\n\nThe red zones are areas where the the resistance is actively fighting the KPA in a more straight up kind of way. Red zone is shoot to kill and you'll often come across various resistance fighters going toe to toe with enemy forces. The red zones are also pretty rough looking with destroyed buildings and burnt out cars being common.\n\nThe only real issue I could say I have with the game is the introduction, it throws you too quickly into blowing ♥♥♥♥ up with no build up. I'd have liked it if we had more build up and were without weapons for a while rather than being given a pistol after the first mission and throwing molotovs are armoured cars. Within 40 minutes depending on how you spend your money you can buy an Assault Rifle (M4 Carbine) which seems a little rushed and not much of a build up to it.\n\nYou can't use enemy weapons, and it's never explained why so you'll be using whatever you've got/bought to fight the KPA and spend time searching bodies for ammo and supplies.\n\nThe campaign is basic but I'm finding it to be pretty fun so far, same with the COOP resistance mode which is fun to play. If anything the online mode feels to have a bit more build up in the way you look and are equiped. You'll start coop mode with some simple clothing and a weapon in each catergory (Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Battle Rifle) and from there you'll level up and go from grime covered Joeblogs who's picked up an M4 to someone wearing heavy battle armour and a gasmask.\n\nAll in all I'd give the game a 7/10 I'd say\n\nTL:DR\n\nPros\n- Pretty fun gameplay\n- Weapon Customisation\n- Loot Simulator\n- COOP\n-  Graphics\n- Red and Yellow zones\n\nCons\n- Not enough build up\n- Weapon variation can be a little lacking (Only one assault rifle)\n-  Vehicles aren't too great (Been on motorcycles only so far)\n- AI can be a 50/50 sometimes with being stupid or out right ruthless.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but it's not as bad as people are making it out to be so far.

(please disregard spelling and punctuation errors for I am a mear child who knows not of grammar.)\n\nI was so happy when this game came out,"finally something to do beside play csgo and wait for borderlands 3".Having been disapointed by battborn this was my last hope to not die of boredom.So I say is homefront worth the price,yes.I look at the reviews for this game and they have no description at all,this has happend three times this year and it's starting to get annoying.What am I talking about,false comparison, let me list off games that have gotten ♥♥♥♥ because of this  battleborn,doom beta,homefront,(SO FAR) as to why this is happening I have no idea but reviews have been ruining these games,for example battleborn was compared to overwatch which has nothing to do with overwatch what so ever same with the doom beta they said it was just a halo clone with call of duty elements ,HAS NOTHING WHAT SO EVER TO DO WITH HALO OR CALL OF DUTY,the only thing similar is the suit that doom guy wears similar to the power armour worn by spartans in halo.Now moving on to the main topic,Homefront the Revolution some of the first reviews on the game were,STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GAME or GAME IS A COPY OF THE DIVISION,again THE GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  THIS OTHER HORRIBLE TITLE DO NOT JUDGE THE GAME OFF OF THESE HALF BAKED REVIEWS THAT HAVE NO MEANING WHAT SO EVER.I said I wouldn't talk about gameplay but I am since I have to mension some of these amazing features.First off story I say it has a intresting plot with decent voice acting and you can really see how the story unfoldes.I FROGOT TO MENSION THE GAME DOES START OUT SLOW but after the 5th or so mission the game really starts to dig deep.Gameplay is well done it does something weird but it fits well,Homefront is the first game I know of that didn't have a completely broken cover system,the game gives you three options of attack,one is stealth with a very modified pressure pistol or you can take out your enemys with various tactics like explosive traps and various amounts of well animated takedowns.The second kind is all out guns blazing mayhem pipebombs molotoves and dragon breath shotgun fun.The third and my favorite is stratagey wich is any type of complex well strategy,example one of the missions has you hold off enemy forces for a extended amount of time so what I you could do was rid a motorcycle into a corridore of enemys jump off shoot a modified assault rifle rocket at it and wipe out a entire wave of enemys.Mensioned befor the motorcycle I WISH they would have included more of these into the game because IT WAS SO MUCH FUN,you could escape the enemy pursuing  you by driving on rooftops to a safehouse by using ramps and slick moves WHICH WAS UTERLY AWSOME.This game has bugs I'm not afraid to admit that but it deserves a fighting chance and it even has a way to bypass the mediocre AI,this is a rare ocassion in games but if you put the game on the hardest difficulty it becomes a million times better with you now running to cover from every threat that can potensially 5-6 shot you resources are hard to come by so you will be using every tactic in the books from stealth to strategy to mayhem as you work your way up to become the most feared freedom fighter to take back philadelphia  I give this game a 8/10 great mechanics and great game.","May 17","true","10.4"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","0"

The graphics are amazing because the devs were smart enough to use the cry engine which kills ue4 or id4 for me personally having issues with the other two engines with other games.\n\nThe good:\n\nPrice compared to other AAA titles\nIntro is outstanding\nGraphics are amazing.\nThere is story building and interesting cutscenes and dialogue compared to the crap that is thrown to us these days where the only goal is to make a quick buck.\nThe sound is great and i like the background music creating mood.\nDrove a motorcycle.\n\nThe bad:\n\nI have come across several issues where the last check point save would bring me back to the wrong place. Also in the first mission at one point it would not trigger that it was actually completed and stuck sort of in a loop.\n\nGameplay feels like Far Cry to be honest. Use the transceiver to discover items in a map. Parts of the map you would capture your team would move to. There is an armory.\n\nWeponary seems basic and limited to weapons made of scrap kind of like metro because of the limited resources your faction/resistance group has.\n\nI found AI to be quite dumb in most situations where they would just run at you and I easily killed 3 guys that walked in a row without sneaking on them. Sometimes i was surprised that the AI used grenades when I was hidden or would shoot me through a window when i passed by. Therefore there is some balancing to be done. Ai system felt like the one in gta when there are 1-5 police stars because at one point there seems to be a bunch of them that spawns somewhere if you create too much havoc and an aircraft shows up so need to gtfot.\n\nThis games needs a patch to be good but now it is acceptable.\n\nI have no graphics problem and I have 3.9ghz 4700k intel and an old r7 2gd plus 24gig of ram and runs perfect so I do not know what the complaints are about.","May 18","true","13.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","0"

It's hard to tell at this point what depth the game will have.  It seems like it has sort of that 'nothing you do really matters' feel that saints row games have.

It is an excellent release, worth every penny. What they accomplished, being in the shoes of the resistance fighter, was done extremely well. This is not Doom or Call of Duty and even thinking about comparing to those is plain silly. You will not be fighting waves of enemies like Rambo. If you attempt to do so, you willl die very quickly. You are supposed to be adopting guerilla tactics, which involves a lot of hit-and-run, outsmarting the enemy, etc. It is an FPS in its own right and big props to the devs for getting it right. Also many concepts were borrowed from later Far Cry games, such as visibility indicators and take-downs and having played all Far Cry games, starting with first one, I can't say this is a Far Cry clone.\n\nI hear many people are having performance issues. I am running it on MSI GS60 pro gaming laptop with 970 and it runs very smoothly, with the exception when the level has just loaded. I don't see any framerate drops and run on the high settings.  Graphics are pretty good as well, not the best though.\n\nThe only complaints are NPC animations, which look a little clunky, especIally of other resistance fighters. Maybe also having an ability to drag bodies away would help, especially in yellow zones. AI can be stupid sometimes, where you can corner them in a small hallway with nothing else but a knife. In one of the yellow zones I managed to slice up about 15 or so soldiers with a little health damage. In an open firefight they are generally pretty good, hiding behind covers and flanking more often than not.\n\nWould I recommend buying it? Hell yes! If you are concerned about price, you can get an activation voucher in other places for less.","May 20","true","39.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

NPC character models are just okay copy and pasted NPCs with maybe a duifferent weapon or helmet.\n\nSound - Okay sound quality as well, voice acting is okay. Actual voice from characters in the game is wonky, Sometimes too loud, too quiet, some times screaming at your face and then whispering to you.\n\nGameplay - The meat and potatoes and I'll sum this up to be quick.\n\n- A to B Ultra linear progression,  example, you start off in a district, and then follow story points, rinse repeat. The only difference is that there are some side stops you can make on the way and loot. On that topic, you have an EXTREMELY simple craft and loot system, nothing crazy just 5-6 ingrideints to make a grenade or two, or a couple of devices.\n\n- Side missions, pop up and repeatable usually the Same AI's in the Same exact area doing the same exact thing.  There are other Side missions to do that arent repeatable.\n\n- The AI, is weak at BEST, most don't engage you, and if they do all you need to do is find a corner or doorway preferably, and then simply wait as they single file rush the door one at a time, if they even manage to find the doorway pathing. Most will stand in the open waiting to shoot at you, some take cover... very few react to seeing you, unless you let yourself get scanned. Friendly AI is even weaker, there's a half parkour system, the AI does not use any of it, and won't follow you unless there's a walkable path.\n\nOn top of this the enemies here are pretty much actual robots, they take upwards of 2 headshots to 6 nody shots to bring down,  unless your using sniper so if your expecting realism this isn't going to be your sauce.\n\nAI spawn points are pretty terrible too as it's possible to clear a building or containers and have enemies spawn where you just cleared. even if you were undetected.\n\nattacking enemy walled strongholds is a joke, the enemies attempt to leave the stronghold or buildings to come kill you, or simply run arund ground level in the middle of it. Instead of using cover and tactics to try and fight you.\n\nAI -10/10\n\nAlot of the Gameplay is just repetative go here fight take point move to next point and its from a pool of the same 5-6 side mission pools, mixed with bad ai is just bad, with a very small customization pool , it's just not a game it's a pro longed demo TBH.\n\n\nTLDR - Not a complete game. Is Long Demo. Not worth anything more than 20$. DLC is even bigger waste.\n\n\nAnother game that again just seems to over anticipate itself. Already claiming to have  "Seasons" worth of DLC ready to go, well perhaps if any of the DLC were in the game  it would have been more fun.","May 18","false","2.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

This game is amazing for such a small team to pulloff. The game is focused, you are not entirely at a loss what you are supposed to do. And yet you have so much freedom about how you want to approach the objectives. The timed flashpoints that people complain about are optional. The main objectives are not timed at all. The performance is indeed choppy but I don't know why everyone expects every game to run at max settings on their PC.\n\nThe complaints about lousy UI are frankly nonsense. It is immersive and intuitive, although it takes some getting used to. The guns feel weighty, although some of the sounds are little less impactful. The attachment system is exactly like the Crysis series, which is actually a good thing as you can adjust according to the situation.\n\nThe controls are fluid, although sometimes the climb mechanic doesn't detect too well, but it is manageable.\n\nAnother thing: THIS GAME IS NOT CALL OF DUTY, BATTLEFIELD, FAR CRY, FALLOUT, ETC. It borrows many elements and combines them together. It is a great combination and not an easy one to pull off. You are not a supersoldier of the most powerful country in world fighting for world freedom. You are a resistance member, labelled terrorist by the state, trying to fight the most powerful nation in the world with outdated technology, outnumbered, and outgunned. You cannot run and gun here. You will certainly die if you do that. Picking you battles is extremely important. And keep in mind that you are just one member of the resistance organization. You cannot save and help everyone. The difficulty is well balanced. The enemies don't feel overpowered or have any unfair advantages. Every time I died I knew it was my mistake.\n\nThe inclusion of coop is a refreshing change of pace, multiplayer would not suit this game at all. The game still has bugs, some potentially game-breaking but usually reloading a previous save fixes the problem.\n\nI don't understand the hate train on this game. Dambuster and Deep Silver has done an amazing job on a game that was basically a back-burner project for four years before being dumped on them by another company.\n\nWorth every cent I paid for, although you might want to wait a few patches to fix the performance and the bugs.

How ? i will come to that later\n\nBut let me tell you,if you have played Far Cry or Assassins Creed series,you will like this game.It follows the same formula.Capture bases,do side Jobs for money,help random citizens or assassinate a KPA general,collect all the collectibles,capture an enemy base to create a safe house....so if you are a gamer who loves this busy work and doing all the side quests and all,you will love this game...but if you are tired of Ubisoft's formula then you will hate it.\nSo first decide what type of gamer you are,then only buy this game.\n\nNow coming back to the unique thing about this game i had mentioned,this game is brutal.This game is brutal.This game is not COD,.that you will just run and gun or like Far Cry,that you will have regenerating health and there will never be a sense of danger.\n\nThis game will ♥♥♥♥ you up,if you just approach it casually. The A.I is good(if not the best),they will hunt you down, if you are not careful.You need to create a strategy,of how you would like to approach a target,how you have to spend you currency because everything is expensive.\nEg:The protective gear is 5000 in cash,maybe you will decide to start saving money,but you also need health kit but you dont have any ,either you can go looking for it in a stash or buy it.Looking for it might be risky because you have to get past the KPA guards but it will save your money.Buying it will be easy but you will lose money.\n\nI loved this aspects of this game coz it made me feel like i am a normal person.I am not some God-gifted character who will just survive everything easily.My character will develop only if i end up buying gear and upgrades that's it.So theres a sense of progression.\n\nSo everything needs to be carefully planned out in this game ,like a guerilla. You cannot just stand there and shoot everyone.You have to make the decision to run away and come back with a different plan.Capturing the bases is not easy.Its you style which will make it unique.\n\nThe story so far is simple.I am in the yellow zone and i am working to motivate the people to start uprisings and all.I mean its a 'Revolution' game,what else we should expect ?\n\nThe open world is distinctive. Till now i have unlocked two zones: red and yellow\nRed is where you can go with your guerilla buddies and screw everyone up,yellow is where your enemies are stronger and you are mostly alone,so you have to use stealth,or they will ♥♥♥♥ you up.So i can say so far the two zones are different and not similar which is nice.\n\nSo at the end ,this game is not broken,not the worst game you will ever play blah,blah\nEvery game has an audience and i think it will only appeal to a particular audience.\nI found it great coz i am a part of that audience but i understood that it will not cater to other eveyone here.\n\nSo if you have read all my points and you think this is your game,buy it....\nIf not then don't waste your money.","May 25","true","31.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

I enjoyed the first game and I love the premise of the series. Judging from the trailers and gameplay, however, I knew the game was going to be mediocre at best; I wasn't wrong.\n\nI don't hate this game. Despite its many flaws I really do enjoy it. But I can't recommend it.\n\nMy main complaint is how buggy the damn thing is. This is flat out lazy and unacceptable. An example of these terrible bugs is the hacking tool. You throw it at hackable objects to affect them. Good luck getting this to register. Half the time nothing happens and you have to rebuild the damn things or go buy them. So when the game doesn't register this and your low on cash you better go scavenging through the environments. Did I mention you have to do this to progress through some story missions? Speaking of the story it has some cool moments, such as the intro. But, it’s not memorable. Characters are boring, minus Parrish, and it quickly becomes obvious that the game is padding itself out and wasting your time with some objectives. One being finding a secret door, then finding the people who can open the door, then finding one who lost his friends, then finding his friends, then killing KPA to access a boat, then finally getting the damn keycard to progress.\n\nNext is shooting and movement. I didn't mind the slower movement and inaccurate weapons. Now, I'm not sure if this was done on purpose to simulate a rookie gruella fighter, or if it was the product of inexperienced developers. Probably the former. Anyways, my main issue is jumping and climbing. It's confusing, and downright random. Sometimes you can grab unreachable ledges, grab a ledge to slide off, or just miss a grabble ledge despite meeting the requirements to grab it.\n\nThere are goods. The weapon customization is fantastic, despite some odd restrictions. For example, you can only put a silencer on your pistol. Some weapons are downright awesome, such as the RC car bomb. The takedown animations are great. The environments are gorgeous and fun to look at. It's cool taking districts back and seeing the change that it brings visually. There are some moments of flat out greatness when you play; they’re just few and far between.\n\nI don’t hate this game at all, but I can’t recommend it. It’s just meh. If you’re interested wait until it is on sale and when some of the bugs are hopefully fixed.","May 20","false","12.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Most of the reviews are bad beacsue they cant get 60fps on thier 980ti. I have dual 970s and it runs fine at 1440p.\n\nThe first thing i noticed is that the graphics are very good. The guns are good but the recoil is bad.\n\nStory is nice, with the amazing, I repeat amazing guerrilla warefare. I mean you can hide in torn down houses or hideouts and ambush a KPA patrol with anything, You get like 5 kills and then you have to run off before renforcements arrive.\n\nYou have safe houses and look out points that you can use to make use of your surroundings.\n\nOne thing i advice is that you use a Nvidia card. My mate has 2 380xs and only get 30fps with stuttring. This game is very hard to run, mainly becuase it is the same game engine used to run CRYSISS 3 !!!!!!\n\nSo dont be afaid to turn the graphics down, the game still looks good at medium settings, Just imagine the ps4 and xbox one.\n\nCons\n\nThere are some buggs where you see npcs walk through eachother.\n\ni do recomend this game. For those with NVIDIA cards from 780 onwards.","May 20","true","6.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

My game runs around 50-60 fps constantly with a 960 graphics card, so thats no problem at all really.  As for the game itself, i personally think the game is very fun, and has a good mix of stelath combat, with open combat as well.  When played on the hardened difficulty, the game offers a good mix of realistic damage, where you can die in as little as 3 shots, but enough survivability to make the game playable.  Probably the best feature of the game is the amazing gun customization, where on the battlefield, you can turn your assualt rifle into an LMG, or a grenade launcher, and so on.  The only thing that i found weird in game design was the lack of player dialogue, as you kinda seem like a spectator the enitre time during cutscenes.  I think the devs were going for immersion in the cutscenes, but didnt turn out so well.   But I honestly recomend the game, and although i believe the first homefront game had a better story and was more captivizing, the revolution is a pretty good game, and doesnt deserve as many negative reviews as it has gotten.  Is it worth teh 60 dollar price tag?  I would lean to saying no, because there are other games coming out right now that should take preference over this.  If this game ever goes on sale, it would be a great purchase then.","May 23","true","6.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

In this Homefront, NK is the most technologically advanced country in the world. We bought everything from phones to guns from them, but we did it with credit. Korea shuts everything off and forces us to pay our debt off with our country. You're part of the rebellion in Philidelphia, slowly becoming a hero while just trying to find an important man.\n\nAction:\nThe action gets a little repetative too quickly. I am a very creative person, especially while killing faceless NPC's. Either you molotov a patrol and drop the stragglers or you die... The APC's are stupid, three pipe bombs underneath it won't blow it up, but shooting it's gas tank once with a pistol will catch the whole thing on fire... Hacking anything besides doors is a joke. Drones stay hacked for 4 seconds, I only know that because I timed it. The weapon customization is the only thing holding the combat together, and that is saying a lot.\n\nMultiplayer(Or the Co-op crapfest):\nIf you don't have a friend or two, good luck. The co-op is actually pretty decent mechanically. A good character customization menu, where items look good cosmetically and are still useful. The community is the biggest killer. It is still early though, so when it goes on sale hopefully the community will broaden.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game is stunning, I run on high and get 60 fps without a single drop. It is very beautiful, even the reflection of a building on your gun will have you going "Wow" like Eddy Wall. If you love clean,yet dirty graphics. This is a game for you.","May 20","true","4.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HammerTonk/recommended/223100/","HammerTonk","[BTB]Hammerdown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HammerTonk/","526 products in account","I'll probably revisit this review when I've had more play time, but I feel I have to get some thoughts down on the proverbial paper now, before anything slips my mind.\n\nThis game got absolutely RAILED by day one complaints about their release schedule and overall sloppy execution of handling pre-orders and perhaps it was rightly deserved to an extent, but that is certainly not a reason to write a bad review on steam.\n\nA lot of negative reviews seem to focus solely on a singular aspect such as bugs, or people simply being unable to play- which isn't a review, get a damn refund or wait for a patch. Writing a negative 'review' and claiming the game is a piece of crap because your hardware either isn't up to code, or doesn't seem to work isn't a 'review' at all.\n\nAs for myself? I'm running a pretty average to above average set up, no grandiose water cooled big rig for me, but the game runs smooth as silk with my 4gb GTX 970 at stock with an 8350 processor. Nothing to write home about but it handles the game like a charm. No bugs, no trippy visuals, not a damn thing wrong.\n\nGameplay is above average as it stands right now, you capture bases and take territory, you kill some norks, you ambush some more norks, you use resistance boobytraps to launch norks thirty feet into the air, it's a good laugh.\n\nThe gun play might feel floaty (I have aim assist off) and the recoil might seem excessive if you're used to current gen shooter mechanics- I'm looking at COD here, not ARMA3, so prepare for a vague learning curve on how weapons and the very basic cover system works.\n\nThe cut scenes and character models are marvelous, but seem wasted when you look at the sub-par AI. Though I've not had any of the issues with people witnessing enemy vehicles simply not reversing when they hit walls etc, I have seen some less than stellar combat where enemies don't flank, they don't seem to adapt, they don't seem to think at all. They shoot at you, they duck, they run somewhere else thirty yards away, duck and shoot, with an occassional grenade tossed in for good measure.\n\nI'm getting a little ranty but I felt like given how hard this game has been nailed to the wall, I have to give it some credit, it went through a terrible development process and an even worse development cycle and it certainly shows on the rougher edges- but I'm having fun, and where the visuals are nothing ground breaking for 2016, I'd gladly say they're keeping up with current shooters whilst not establishing any really new trends of their own.\n\nThe price tag is a little steep to me if the game is going to proceed for the next 20 hours like this but I'd still give my recommendation and suggest waiting for either a sale if you're completely unsure. Otherwise test the waters for an hour or so and decide for yourself. You'll lose nothing by asking for a refund providing your issue is a genuine one and you're under the two hour limit.\n\nI'll give a better overall review when done I'm sure, but for now I feel like I've not played enough to justify giving it a thorough once over- there are plenty of folks on either side of the fence who have so feel free to check out their reviews, a cautionary thumbs up from me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeriostm/recommended/223100/","cheeriostm","CheeriosTM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeriostm/","678 products in account","TL;DR Not good, not bad, but its probably better priced at 20 bucks or less.\n\nI want to like this game. I want to like it so bad. The things I heard about it before I bought it made it sound great. I got it... and... well... It's not bad, necessarily, but it's also not very good.\n\nThe game is, in a word, repetative.\n\nNow, that wouldn't be such a big deal, but the repetation isn't all that fun. The guns are rather limited, sort of, and you get the equivalent of a single magazine for a few of the guns. The customization is actually pretty cool, but you can only ever take one main gun with you - even those it turns into 2 other guns - and you'll basically save up for all the weapon attachments you give a ♥♥♥♥ about in the first couple of hours.\n\nI honestly was disappointed with leaving the first area and having anything worth a ♥♥♥♥ already unlocked.\n\nThe second area is a LOT better, but only because there's a lot more enemies everywhere. Stealth mechanics - or what exists of them - play a bigger role in the second area, but they're still somewhat weak. I spent basically the first 2-3 hours of my playthrough in the first area and only died a handful of times due to stupid mistakes. In the second zone, I basically just died every time I aggroed anything - and so the game takes a weird turn in that zone with only a bit of warning, especially given how medicore of a challenge the first zone was.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the game is BAD, but again, its also not very good.\n\nI'd totally recommend this if you're bored and its 20 bucks or less. Get a couple hours of enjoyment, or something to do, and then move onto something you'd rather play.\n\nThis try at Homefront, while still interesting, is basically a sort of indie, alternate-reality shooter wrapped in a AAA title's clothes. The first Homefront was better, in my opinion, but at least this one lasted longer.\n\nHaven't tried the multiplayer yet, but then Homefront 1's multiplayer was probably better given the progression system it had.","June 2","true","4.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Running FX 8350 CPU (OC only to 4.3), R9 270x  gpu, 16 gb ram. That being said most of my settings are just on High, some a little more. I am also just running with most settings at high, and not pushing it too much yet.\n\nDefinitely has the Crysis feel to it graphically. Some of the texures could use improvement, but overall are well done.\n\nThe guns seem a bit clunky as others have mentioned. They are not bad, just not great. It does seem that you can steady all guns, even pistols which makes a big difference. I do love the ability to mod the hell out of the guns, this should hold some promise.  This gives you the ability to change your strategy on the fly which can be a very good thing.\n\nVoice acting I feel is passable. I would say maybe 10%-20% above par, but certainly didn't draw me in quite the way it could have. They make their point, but they don't give me an adrenalin rush of fight or flight.\n\nMy biggest annoyance so far, and there have been few, is that when you shoot the enemies, they just seem to absorb it. I personally would like to see them falter a bit, show something that I just nailed him. I want to know that they felt it, I want to know that they are hurting...maybe I ask too much.\n\nOverall I think that I will enjoy it. I am curious as to the amount of play looting and crafting has on the game, but with an open world, I think I will have gotten my money worth. If I find glaring issues, I will ammend.\n\n\n","May 17","true","19.6"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","15","34","0","0"

Easy decision. Only took an hour.\n\nGiven that a large chunk (or maybe all - idk) of the first hour of the single player game mostly consists of cutscene-like things, I jumped into the co-op mode with two friends. That's what I bought the game for anyway. We were treated to downgraded visuals, silly clipping issues, and absurd NPC behavior (call it Artificial Unintelligence). It was not fun, not even in the ironic sense where bad game design can be unintentionally hilarious. It just sucked - in an entirely bland and tedious way.\n\nHomefront: the Revolution isn't ready. For anything. It's the Aliens: Colonial Marines of 2016. In honor of the 16th anniversary of Old Man Murray's "Time-to-Crate" review system, I'll grade HtR on a scale of "Time-to-Refund," and give it a score of 20 minutes (the time I spent in the co-op). I think that's like a 17 out of a possible 100, if 100 represents the two-hour refund window, or something. Who cares.\n\nSave your 60 bucks for something else, like a vacation to Detroit.

Don't get me wrong, the performance is not good for half of us, I had to low down too much things for my taste, but if this is patched, you have a decent semi-open world shooter with a story I pretty much like and lot of side stuff to do. Yeah, it's repetitive, but If repetitive tasks is not for you, then I recommend to never play a game haha :)\n\nYou unlock parts of the map like a Far Cry game and you loot and play vertically like Dying Light sometimes, and that's a good thing. You also feel that you are in a rebellion, the atmosphere is good and the graphics are enough to believe the world you are in. There is so much little details everywhere that you know they worked for real on the level design. The controls and gunplay are ok, sometimes you try to jump in a window and it does not work at the first try, guns have good recoil but I like how you feel like an actual street rebel who can't shoot instead of a genious army shooter with 150 years of experience lol. AI get stuck or is a little dumb here and there, but nothing game breaking at all, you know, funny bugs.\n\nIt's clear that it's not the perfect game of the year but for me it's a pleasant FPS with a story I like.\n\nGaming culture is at its worse at the moment I think. It's like nobody can enjoy a game anymore. I'll be fair tho, if the optimization is not fixed, wait for it to be fixed before buying, or enjoy the game anyway like I do because the world don't turn around me and anyway the gameplay is fun. I know everything positive will be thumbed down maybe here, and negative will we thumbed up.  I see no reason at all to take a side, it's just my opinion and opinions differ.

Friendlies blocking doors and never ending hoardes of badies (and friendlies) coming out of the wood work looking to make a kill. The game is a challenge (the good kind, enimies main style of attack is like previous asian style warfare, aka numbers for strength).

I am running significantly powerful hardware:\nTitan X SLI (Which game does not support)\n6700K\n3 Samsung 2TB SSDs\n32GB of DDR4 Ram\nWith that said, on 1440p, settings maxed out I can expect as low as 30ish frames in some areas.

And this is more of a personal thing... But I like to be able to see my avatar's body in game. And this game does it, but does it in a silly way.

I couldn't seem to really hit anything with my pistol at any kind of range (Not a FPS noob, love FPS, not to shabby at them) so not sure if the game just hates the pistol and wants you to use it CQB exlcusively and not even just short ranges.\n\nI want to like this game, I really do, but because the state of its release, it needs some cleaning up before I can recommend it.","May 17","false","11.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","16"

The game has a few bugs that I have found but nothing extremly bad or game breaking. Did not really have a fps problem and I played the game on ultimate setting. I bet that because I am not trying play the game on a potato.  The story is good even if the ending was a little on the WTF. It really did make you feel like you where fighting an uphill battle. Plus the opening video was so bad it good. USA buys tech from North Korea and keeps buying tell the USA is trillions of dollars in debt to North Korea.\n\nMy biggest problem was the world. Where it was kinda open world. Sadly once you do a few mission in that zone. You leave the zone and unless it one of 2 zone you will never go back again. The large amount of friendly npc and the lack of enemy npc breaks the immusion on the oppressive North Korea part. Also I hate the crappy crapy hacking mini game.\n\nI think the game is good. I felt I got my money worth from it but you might just want to wait for it to go on sell. Which this is a shocker for me. I rarely feel I get my money worth out of a game. It is even more so it rare for me to even like a game. I feel to many games are just piles of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game takes some of the better elements of Farcry. Then gives you the ability to carry 9 guns. Half of them suck but once you upgrade a few you get some great fps gameplay.","May 25","true","22.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","2"

I haven't played the previous Homefront game because I heard the storyline was short and I like playing singleplayer games. I'm not much into multiplayer considering all I come across are cheaters who think aimbots are fun for some reason. Battlefield 3 was the last frustrating multiplayer game i played. Anyway! This game is challenging and sure the storyline is simple but I love the combat, the equipment upgrading and taking back areas of the map with other NPC's as you just recruit random guys to fight next to you.

Goes to show you can't trust any reviews except your own. However, this game wasn't for me as it probably was for many other players. Although I only played the game for approximately two hours, here's my opinion on how well Homefront: The Revolution did in standard categories.\n\nSome notes to keep in mind:\n-Average shooter skills\n-Played on hardest difficulty\n-Avid FPS player\n-Average system spec (i7 4790k, GTX 660TI, 16GB 1866MHz ram)\n\nNow onto the review...\n\nGraphics: 7.5/12\nThe graphics are what you would expect from a CryEngine game, it is definitely higher end than most games. The city looks very realistic and almost Division-like although it has a more scanty and poverty driven erosion rather than abandonment. Rain and water on the ground reflected somewhat accurately albeit I see random white spots in buildings indicating small puddles, even when it was night time. Graphical glitches are present like many people have seen; so far I have seen enemies caught halfway between walls when they die, friendly AIs with no guns, and quite frequently a floating dead drone. Overall, the graphics was not the problem for me, even with those funny glitches.\n\nAudio: 2.79/5.58\nSound tracks were okay, but the voice acting wasn't very smooth and there were many bugs with my playthrough. If you press esc or alt tab while an npc was speaking, their speech was gone completely. Only the animation would remain. Not even the subtitles would continue if the speech disappeared. You would think the sounds of the weapons would be closer to the real thing, afterall we live in 2016 and effects are pretty accurate and realistic nowadays. Instead, this game chose to focus on its cutting edge graphics and just kind of toss the audio in the blender and hoped it mixed well, which it didn't.\n\nPerformance: wtfwhy/2\nWhy did the developers decide to waste money on denuvo? Dunno, but one thing I do know is that wherever Denuvo is, performance issues will come. It takes a moderately high to high end pc to continuously run this game at 60fps. For me, the game only took a dip to about 35-40 FPS but that was still enough to make the shoddy gunplay in this shooter somewhat hard to control even with controlled single shots from a decked out assault rifle. Changing settings didn't do anything: I restarted the game with low, medium, and high settings (minus AA and VSync for all of them) and didn't see any change in FPS. The controls were somewhat easy to understand but not as customizable as you may think. Only the basics were allowed to be changed, however things like replacing the holster button to something more convenient than 0 (zero) was not possible because it wasn't even in the keybindings.\n\nAI/Difficulty: lol/420\nEnemies and allies were all hit or miss on the hardest setting. There's a 50% chance you run into a convoy that does the right thing and defends it with their lives, taking cover and moving up when neccessary. The other 50% you have either every KPA in the block and their mothers bumrushing you as they spawn close by or wall huggers. Yes, wallhuggers. Doesn't even matter if they are shocktroopers, assaults, or even vehicles. They will pick a wall, they will run to that wall, and they will hug that wall. Outside of skirmishes when its time for stealth, you can't rely on your pistol because they won't go down with a single headshot. Takedowns are reliable but the stealth mechanics in this game makes it so easy to be spotted unless you are taking a lone soldier down. On the hardest setting I managed to secure all of the first zone when you are ambushing a convoy by just taking cover and popping headshots which you should be doing anyways, cause ammo is limited. Given the fact that Dambuster guaranteed Dark Souls-like difficulty... can't say they properly did that because the AI is bad.\n\nOverall: meh/5\nThis game is okay; it isn't as good as Far Cry 3 or Crysis, but it is a hell of a lot better than the first Homefront. Weapon customization was a big plus, story was also much better as you aren't stuck with the same 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s the entire game, and just being able to freely choose if you want to gather materials or do missions makes this game a whole lot better than what I expected. However, in my opinion Homefront: The Revolution doesn't make the cut with triple AAA games... You can't just slap the words CryEngine on a game and then expect people to pay $60, we want more than just graphics. Not only that, but to take away the multiplayer PVP and then leaving only COOP was a bad idea. If this game was released at $30 then maybe I might have bought it, but for now I'm taking my $60 and going to Overwatch","May 18","false","1.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

There is a gigantic open world environment that is interesting to explore. There is a surprisingly complex weapon upgrade system, vehicles are supported and there is stealth gameplay. The game is a mess in many ways ... It is readily apparent that the details were a secondary concern in this massive, almost bloated, game. For example, when you use a flashlight, the illumination drags behind the camera movements ... to simulate a hand actually holding a flashlight I guess? The end result is that you feel seasick and disoriented from using one of the basic tools in the game.\n\nThe main missions are diverse, but the experience is very incoherent. Remember how Valve makes an effort maintain the first person perspective with free camera movements in both combat, traversal, and story beats? This game is kind of the opposite. It feels like a patchwork of disjointed parts.\n\nPerformance is a mess in large open world sections, that make up the majority of the game, even when using a Titan X.\n\nThis game reminds me of an infamous classic in the open world genre: Do people still remember Boiling Point: Road to Hell from the russian developer Deep Shadows? Both Homefront and that game are reaching for the stars on a too limited budget. The game systems are bloated and lack refinement, but they are overcompensating by providing a lot of content and scope. It kind of works, I guess? Homefront definitely feels like a unique take on the open world genre, just like Boiling Point did in its time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093578224/recommended/223100/","76561198093578224","Guy Fieri","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093578224/","34 products in account","So I went into this game almost completely blind, my friend and I were looking for a game to play together and didn’t find anything until I found this game. We waited until this game came out and bought it on release. We were reading the comments about how optimization was poor and how it was slow and lagging and etc. We both have very good computers and both of us were able to successfully load the game. As with many newer games you may need a decent computer. The graphics are impressive, and neither him or me experienced major issues concerning it lagging. This game has a really promising multiplayer although the story fell a bit flat.\nThe multiplayer, in my opinion, is the best part of the game and I loved it for the first four(ish) hours. The small amount of maps limits the playability of the game since there isn’t a lot of different ways to play each map. Let me just say that this is a really fun multiplayer game with some interesting missions. The problem is there are what six maps, maybe seven? Half are based on offense and the others are defensive. I already payed $60 for this game, why do I have to pay about $6 for more maps that probably are the same type of missions. A lot of people are complaining about the bad AI, I disagree.  The AI is pretty good at spotting you (and killing you). We only encountered a dead body glitching through a wall. In the multiplayer the enemies aren't always positioned in the same space when you start, and I really enjoyed that added challenge.\nWhat I really don't enjoy about multiplayer other than the limited maps and somewhat repetitive missions, is that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lady on the coms. "What's the hold up!" "What's the hold up!" Oh, I don't know? Maybe the two tanks that just rolled in? Constantly annoying me when I don't speed through a level. She is the Navi of Homefront. This also brings up another point, the game doesn’t want you to stealth. The knife killing animations are awesome, like oh my God watching another player knife an unsuspecting soldier is cool. So naturally, we wanted to try to do missions in stealth. After trying to sneak, we realized something: this game doesn't want you to sneak. Sure the snipers are easy targets for your knife, but on the ground, where you are most of the time, you have limited stealth options. No sneak rolling/running or anything that's common in games that want to provide a stealth option. Well you may be asking, "well Guy Fieri this game isn’t meant for stealth, it’s about guns!" To that I would reply with saying that the game wanted to provide a guerrilla style warfare that is common in American war history. A part of it is sneaking. Also, in your skill tree you can pick up several sneak related skills like not being seen as easily by enemies. Why give me that skill when I can't get a silencer until I buy x amount of crates (which I suggest focusing on getting weapons and armor before attachments) and as soon as I fire every single enemy in the entire universe knows exactly where I am? This limits the ways to play their small selection of maps. Also another problem, that i'm sure a little later won't be a problem, I can't seem to find any servers?\nThere is a story, and admittedly I haven’t played a bunch, but what I have played is average. Unskippable, boring cutscenes giving me unwanted explanations of the situation are the first ten minutes of the game. Then*spoilers* the two people you are with die. Walker gets arrested, and you go to the main resistance in the area. They get mad at you when you fall into their well marked tunnel and start beating you up before asking for authentication? No, i’m sorry you are the worst tunnel keeper in history.*end spoiler.* Again this is just the beginning maybe it gets better later, there are better people to talk about the story than me.\nI do recommend this game though, like I said the multiplayer is fun. One thing I find very impressive is that for the multiplayer to feel fun you don’t need another friend. Your mic is always on which I think gives a realness to the game.  After taking away the good graphics, there is a good game. The gun mechanics are good and I really like the skill tree and the way you obtain weapons and gear. I think what would make the multiplayer better is obviously adding more maps for free, but also opening up areas for mass multiplayer games like a team deathmatch and capture the flag. Also I wish that in multiplayer and the main story we were able to customize our character, and I don’t mean picking from a few female characters and a few male characters.  Overall 7/10.","May 21","true","6.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

I completed this campaign in about 15 hours.\n\nOverall rating: 63/100\n\nNot going to win any awards but it is definitely better then the first Homefront.

Game gives gamers a choice u can make either to play stealthy or balls-to-the wall gun blazing. I had to turn down some of my graphics settings to improve frames. game is not optimized well, but I play video games more for the mechanics than graphics. even with that said I average 40-50 fps, turning down graphic settings.  vehicle controls could of been done better, but are not horrendous.  covering system is ok, storyline so far is great.\n\nOverall, I would rate this game so far 8/10 due to not being optimized well or vehicle controls.

BUT! It IS a good looking game; during the day. The night sucks. It's near impossible to see anything without flipping on the flashlight. Night becomes scary and unnecssarily difficult to navigate and fight in. Another thing is the frame issues. Every once in awhile there's a drop, or freeze for a second, but it bounces back. The weapons are a whole nother story. The weapons are awesome. Having a weapon for near every situation is great, and carrying one weapon means you're carrying three. (For instance, the pistol converts to an SMG or a silent Air pistol) Gear is seemingly unnecessarily tedious to get, but is useful, I just wish it could be upgraded even further. Weapon Upgrades really do make a difference as well. The Red Zone/Yellow Zone concept is also very novel, switching between zones that are all-out warfare, and zones that require stealth and stealthy killing is really fun, though it can be annoying.

The campaign really feels like you're up against a far superior force, Kind of reminds me of that old Freedom Fighters game in style and tone. Being able to quickly mod your weapons anywhere is pretty great and needs to be in more games, IMO.

You havent got the firepower to match for a start, so the game has to be treated with a stealth approach, avoiding rather than confronting. once you take a few zones and meet some resistance fighters, the weapons become heavier, and you can go on the offensive a bit.\nI'm enjoying the game, playing as a guerilla fighter, not a combat soldier. There are one ore two frustrating aspects of the game for me. 1. lack of saves are a bit annoying, but at least when you revive, you've still got your cash. 2. The enemy seem to be bullet sponges. You can hammer away at them, and they take ages to go down. I find if you buy a scope for your battle rifle, headshots do the trick.\nI'm givng this game a positive review, simply because i'm enjoying a lot of stealth, and a few good firefights.\nI've had absolutely no tech problems so far, so fingers crossed.\nI bought mine as  a 5 disc set, because the Aussie dollar is too low to buy on Steam, but still qiuite a costly game for those who don't like it.","May 23","true","30.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

I am playing with the difficulty notched up and find it challenging - it isn't possible to run into every situation with guns blazing (and survive). Planning, varied approaches, and tactics, is definitely necessary for each encounter. I have seen a few stutters, fell through the bottom of the earth once, and am a bit under-whelmed with "hacking", but find nothing that has ruined the experience.

I'm 8.3 hours in, and I intend to play a great deal more. I have more fun in the freeroam than doing the campaign missions, and this will most likely be where I put most of my time in the game.\n\nIn depth:\n\nPros -\n-Graphics are amazing, providing your PC can handle them. I know there have been some issues with performance, but so far I haven't encountered many issues.\n\n-Free Roam World is excellent in my opinion. There's always something going on. The patrols are well placed. Red Zones are hectic and war like, with yellow zone activity being more based on stealth. The balance of human enemies and drones is well handled, with the enemies managing to be challening without being unfair.\n\n-Gunplay and customization is very good. I've had a whole lot of fun with the feel of the guns and the customization, and the progression of these systems is well handled with points being unlocked for completing actions in the world. The attachment and conversion system is very interesting, and allows you to have a large amount of tactical options available whilst only carrying 2 primary weapons and a pistol. Recoil feels good and is countered by the grip and sight attachments, as well as the weapon upgrade system.\n\n-Variety of things to do in the world keeps things interesting. There are plenty of mini objectives to complete in the world. From doing side missions such as taking down patrols and photographing enemy agents and drones, to capturing bases, destroying strongholds and saving the people from enemies.\n\nCons -\n-AI could be improved. Sometimes I do find that the AI aren't very smart. There can sometimes be no reason behind when they hide, and when they push up and attack. Whilst this keeps the AI unpredictable and interesting to play against, it can lead to them making some stupid moves, such as running up a staircase in a line to be killed one by one. I haven't had much of a problem with bad AI, but it is noticable.\n-There are *some* bugs. I haven't encountered many graphical or game breaking bugs, but I have noticed some. The "free running" movement system sometimes seems strange. Some times you may grab ledges, and sometimes your character may miss them completely leading to you falling to the ground hurting yourself. This can sometimes be annoying, but isn't game breaking. The majority of bugs I have encountered are audio bugs, with some non-major audio such as music and background effects muting themselves during cutscenes, however they soon return and haven't had too much of an effect on gameplay.\n-Aim Tracking seems a bit off. You can easily tell this game was made for consoles first and foremost. You can't rebind some keybinds, such as holstering your weapon, which is essential in blending in and is stuck bound to the '0' key. Aim assist starts on by default, and leaves the mouse feeling sluggish, and is best turned off. Also sometimes you can take shots with your weapon that very clearly hit, but will not register. It's unknown why this occurs but it's noticable with most weapons. Whilst this only happens rarely, you don't want to be shooting a rocket launcher at a truck, only to have the hit not register and you die because of this bug.\n-In Game cutscenes aren't the best. The models can sometimes seem desynced and animations aren't the cleanest for a cryengine game. However, this can be ignored and doesn't take away from either the story or the gameplay. Overall I don't really count this as a drawback, as I'm more interested in the free-roam gameplay than the story, but if you are majorly into your storytelling, this may annoy you.\n-Story isn't very deep or interesting. Whilst the game takes some time to put a gun in your hands, which feels quite nice and well paced, you spend most of the start of the game with people talking down to you like a baby in a pram, whilst your silent protagonist lets himself walk into strange situations that don't seem to really progress the story. For example *spoilers*, your taken hostage by your own people, and have to sit through a cutscene for about 5 minutes that doesn't really add anything. One word from your character would skip it, but instead you have to sit through bad animation and pointless storytelling for the sake of it. Whilst only a minor issue, I still found this annoying.","May 22","true","14.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Graphics are boosted & are wonderful(even for lower end users!). There is alot here so far, although that aspect I would have to revisit upon completion as far as length and true depth. I'm actually about 8 hours in roughly, and it really feels theres lots left to do, & Im hoping thats the case. Before specuilating any further on story, I mean the beginning has been exciting, but where it goes from here I'm not sure yet, but I DO feel there is enough fun here for me to reccomend. ALTHOUGH, there will be an update shortly as per full content..All in all, voted up because of how awesome it feels & that everything is there that can be fun for most of us, I have set up explosives SOOO many ways, and only scratched the surface of customizations, I mean everything IS here for an awesome experience, and frankly its scratches that itch as theres really nothing else quite like it for the time being(from my perspective anyway?) You really have to play it to get it, it runs SMOOTH, I'm crossing my fingers it persists and grows on story more throughout the game, so yeh def. will be an update to this review...\n**Also, I should mention that I could not find a game last night(at 2am) for the co-op play, can't explain why yet, wether it was the time, or is dead already, so will update this aspect too.**\nBut even as a single-player experience(so far) I am having fun & excited to play more.\n**I'm STILL waiting for more gripping storyline in this game, rrgh, and well I think it was smart of them to make the AI so unpredicteable and challenging cause thats what brings me back to wanting to play more, Ive been doing a boatload of the side missions first as thats just my tendency, but seriously the last update I make to this WILL be adressing the story, as I want to be further along to be sure it soaks in before critiquing in totality.","May 24","true","25.1"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","7","20","0","0"

Where the original Homefront had plenty of convincing backstory, dynamic buildup and lore, this game has nothing but a cheesy excuse for what is going on that seems rushed and under planed.\n\nWhile I admit the process of co-op character creation made me give up all hope and thus I didn't actually play co-op, but based on what I have seen, the original Homefront had a creative and unique multiplayer on par with battlefield with large maps a variety of weapons perks and vehicles. On Homefront the revolution you run around in large empty maps with three other players playing against bots. The multiplayer is lazy and shows a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nThis game is a game designed just for profit as seen by the optimization for counsel and udder disregard for PC gamers (not saying PC gamers deserve the best, but if the game would have been designed for the gamers they would have optimized the game for all platforms not just the more profitable ones) the frame rates are crap and the game devours resources.\n\nThis game is a cheap rip-off of the original and stands to solid the Homefront franchise and degrade it to the levels of a Call of Duty sequel.

Funnily enough it gives you the option turn of toggle ads but no option to toggle crouch or sprint so yeah have fun. because its default is toggle and i ♥♥♥♥ing hate toggle run and crouch, i know that's my preferance but it's two thousand and ♥♥♥♥ing sixteen and every game should give you the option to either toggle or hold.\n\nAlso: The game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. stealth is an option but it is impossible to accomplish because enemies are at every single turn and very weirdly placed, for example: i tried sneaking into an enemy base and halfway through a bunch of my own guys spawned INSIDE the base and i literally saw them spawn on the minimap, compeltly ♥♥♥♥ing that up. The game also feels very "far cry"  ish. Oh and don't forget the magical blimp that spawns enemies "immersevly" 10m's away. And i feel like there is some hidden mouse acceleration or smoothing going on which always annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. You don't even get to shoot anyone until about 30mins in. this especially looks bad comapared to doom, wherein it took a total of 15 seconds. i mean i know its got a story but for ♥♥♥♥ sake at least but a little something to whet my appetite.\n\nOverall i would NOT recommend this game.

Both computers are running on MSi z97 motherboards with 16Gigs of G.Skill Trident DDR3 RAM. The i7 is SSD, and the i5 is an HDD.\n\nSo far I'm only a couple hours in. ***update*** Finished the game at just under 19 hours and only a few minor hiccups when a scripted event loaded up a ton of baddies all at once, the framerate dropped to 25 for about a whole entire second then went back to running as well as before. Seriously I'm trying to nit-pick at this point, because the game is running without issue for me.\n\nOne of the "tricks" is to pick the high/very high textures and NOT the ULTRA with these particular setups. There really is no discernible difference between ultra and very high other than the amount of VRAM and processing your card will need to do, unless you are trying to do some 4K+ thing then it is your own fault for not having a million dollar rig. If you don't know how to tweak graphics settings to get things running nicely, you likely should stick to consoles, or try learning.\n\nFor the actual game itself, singleplayer wise, I'm actually having a lot of fun with it...\n\nIt reminds me a lot of Dying Light, engine wise, with the way you can climb things and the vaulting over stuff and collecting, just with better guns, a nicer map, and Koreans instead of zombies.\n\nI was honestly expecting the worst and ready to refund it at a moment's notice from all the reviews, but other than the AI companions not getting out of the way sometimes, I have yet to have any of the problems people are complaining about. And it looks absolutely Gorgeous, though I wish there was a "sunglasses" option as the "Eye adaptation" in the game can take a little getting used to.\n\nI also like how after the intro it puts you into the open world like: "Here you go! Have fun!"\n\nThis is also not the typical COD "Run around like a chicken with your head cut off" game... You actually need to take cover and place shots well and recruit fighters to come along with you or realize when it is time to run and hide... You know, that thing PvPers never do, what was it? Oh! Strategy! Enjoy the snipers! ^_^\n\nSure it is not perfect, no game is, especially on release day, but it is FUN and wastes my freetime in a good way, and that is what I play games for!\n\nIt seems to be the only people complaining are people trying to run ULTRA on a potato, people with room heaters.. Err... I mean AMD setups, and whining kids and gamejocks that expected a PvP ultra-mega-brutal-360noscope-yourmother game.\n\nMaybe all the problems magically show up 20 hours in, right?\n\n***Final Update***\n\nPlayed it all the way through, a little over 18 hours playtime for me, and I have to say I actually enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I'm actually hoping this is the Beginning of a good new series of games.","May 17","true","18.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","0"

I have never before replayed a game because most games are so fin stupid and easy to play with exceptions of super hard boss fights. This game is fps fallout setting with darksouls hardness gameplay, so if you cant handle that move on play some chicken ♥♥♥♥ easy hand-held campaign like cod or bf4 single player or stuff around with 50 000 mods in fallout, or spend hours skinning animals and chasing icons on the map in ubisofts epics, and stop bashing this game. If not for technical issues this is easily 10/10.\n\nWhy 10/10?\n\nFor starters enemies movements are completely unpredictable. I have been siting on a roof studying the enemy patrol moving about on the road under me for 15min and yep no frigin pattern they randomly stop look around and change direction. You cant just watch enemy move about for 1min and sus out their movement pattern so you can set up an ambush. No if you planning and ambush you have to lure enemy in. So many times i planted a bomb on the road after spotting enemy convoy rolling down towards me to find it just stop outside of the bomb reach or turning down side street or just started chasing some other npc starting to cause trouble. Fantastic.\n\nIf you alert the enemy they keep spawning over and over - guess what if you were a rebel fighter fighting against 10 of thousand of soldiers what do you think would happen? But if you alert them and than run to hide, as soon as you break line of sight you can hide behind obstacles or in containers and toilets - you cant do that in say far cry where enemy ai will chase you relentlessly always knowing where you are. Another brilliant thing. Well done on enemy AI. + sometimes enemy might look into the toilet or inside the container. Soo tense plus you have constant threat from airships scanning from above.\n\nAlso its not true that they keep respawning - if you clear an area quietly and don't raise any alarms no enemy will respawn as it should be. However if you alert them and one comes to investigate and than you make noise killing him others will come and than better run and hide as they will start respawning in that zone. Also iv never had an enemy respawn from thin air it looks like they always run from somewhere else into your zone.\nThis is not like majority of games a run and gun affair and probably why so many bad reviews. If you want run and gun play doom - I personally hated it, and don't let me started on repetitive.\n\nThe side missions in homefront are great, varied, I have cleared all of them which other reviewer clearly have not. Missions actually require from you to think explore observe listen. You might see the obj marker on the map and on your screen but that does not mean you will know what to do and how to secure the obj.\n\nMy favourite was having to find some blueprint that was stashed in one of the houses. 1st the area is crawling with enemy so you might want to clear them out quietly. If you don't go quiet well guess what, enemy will keep respawning and if you do sound an alarm better lure them away from the objective building. So I cleared the building and than could not find any blueprints. 5min later I got radio massage telling me to look for markings and symbols on the walls. I checked every wall and could not see ♥♥♥♥. I thought maybe its on the level above me and I need to find how to get up and than I noticed that some of the ceiling panels were hanging and some were missing. I started shooting the ceiling thinking maybe I can break one down and climb to the roof and than I spotted an x, shoot the panel and blueprint flattered down from its hiding spot. Brilliant.\n\nAtmosphere in this game is fantastic. You can spend some time sabotaging and gaining respect from the crowd which ultimately leads to them rebelling against oppressors and becoming recruitable followers (4 at the time I think) or you can try and stealth your way through the whole zone (didn't work for me and I liked how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the crowd gets and randomly attacks the soldiers and beet them to pulp).\n\nTo add i have restarted the game on deathwish and am having so much fun just cruising around attacking enemy patrols and hiding away than looking to atack another patrol or secure an stronghold or outpost. Just wishing i could turn off the minimap.\n\nWHY NOT 10/10?\n\nGraphics\n\nHonestly I didn't care as gameplay was so immersive. I'm running i74790+msi gtx980ti gaming. I could not run all max @1440, it did run all max @1080 but with fps drops so I settled at 1080 medium and some low settings. Still looked good for some reason fantastic during rain and night - noticeably crappy in the midday light.\nFPS drops - the game tends to freeze and fps dropped drastically randomly - it looked like it had to do with enemy ai rather than environment graphics. I noticed whenever I got spotted and alarm was sound id get mini freeze. not every time though. I tried cranking up the graphics and in the areas with no enemy or before enemy found where I was it would run fine even on max setting.\n\nBugs and glitches.\n\nCouple of times I could not progress through a level due to vehicle I was meant to follow got stuck. Quick restart from my save game backup solved it but... something that needs to be fixed\nCharacter models - I played uncharted 4 soo yes these are old looking.\n\nCharacters and story\n\nAgain I played uncharted 4, and tlou but seriously what can be done that's not cliché anymore?\nFor what game was about its good story, actually no the story is crap but the gameplay, enemy ai, missions and side missions unlike most other games I played including uncharted4, fallout dying light etc. were fantastic.\n\nVoice-overs\n\nsome were good some were pore the time wasted on radio recordings would of been better spent on more variety in npc lines\nOverall - I hope other studios can pick the best parts from this game and make something really spectacular next time. Or Dumbusters can learn from their mistakes this time. I don't understand why they had to associate this with homefront which was total failure. This should have been new I.P\n.\nSo I loved atmosphere the heart this game had the gameplay etc it reminded me a lot of Falling Skies. So my tip for next time - Keep it hard like this even harder maybe an alien invasion and definitely new ip.\n\nimagine if moders would treat this same as fallout and improve it\n","May 25","true","34.2"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","11","29","2","0"

No SLI support.  Decent overclocking causes instability.  Random FPS drops.  It's like this game is still in early beta.  I've played early betas that seemed closer to a finished product.  After a clean Display Driver Unistaller wipe I reinstalled my drivers and got the game to run without freezing.  Then I realized the game does not support SLI.  So I disabled SLI and then tried to run with one card at my standard overclock.  Nope.  The game is unstable at a decent overclock.  Then I dialed it back to half.  I paid full price for a garbage game that I'm paying to test apparently.  I kind of feel like a sucker.  The best I can hope for is that there will be some optimization patches tomorrow or in the next few days.  I should have gotten tomb raider.\n\n*I will edit this game as patches and support are forthcoming.  I can play this game ATM with reduced settings and a slight overclock on ONE gpu.  If SLI support is added and the game is optimized I will update my review.\n\nWith a little help from a gamunation article I copied the SLI settings from Ryse: Son of Rome to this game in Nvidia Inspector and now my SLI works although it's still a little buggy with some weird memory artifacts.  The game still needs official SLI support, visual artifact tweaks, and further optimization.  I will give this game an enthusiastic thumbs up when that happens.","May 17","false","9.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","1","8","2","0"

Shooting, especially, feels very good. On normal difficulty, the game is decently difficult, but not overly so. You take a lot of damage when you get hit, but enemies are fairly inaccurate. You only regenerate a small amount of health quickly, the rest regenerates very slowly. Medkits are pretty rare and take a bit of rationing. This makes engaging enemies dangerous if they aren't taken out quickly. Stealth is possible, but pretty hard. Gunshots are loud, so using an unsuppressed weapon (Assault rifle, shotgun and battle rifle) alerts enemies far away. The SMG and Pistol with suppressors are very weak, and won't one-shot most enemies, even with headshots, so you'll have to shoot enemies quickly to stop them from alerting nearby enemies. They can also sometimes see you through walls, which is annoying.\n\nPerformance isn't as bad as I expected after reading a lot of reviews. With a GTX970, i5-4460 and 8gb RAM I'm getting solid 60fps at medium settings.","May 24","true","12.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","0"

You would think that mixing Crysis2 and Farcry3/4 would give you something stellar, but the game is held back by technical aspects. I am think that if the game gets some patch love this game would be worth 60 bucks. At launch though its worth 40 bucks IMO. 15 hours if joe blow plays, maybe 25 if you 100%. No NG+. Farcry3/4 with a "face lift" and no fetch quests.\n\nI have two 780's, this game doesn't run SLI. This seems to be par for the course however, SLI support has sucked for the past year. I have to run this game at low settings to get this to run at 60fps on my 2560x1080 monitor. This game runs like cold molasses, uphill, in january, on pluto. When I did have my settings jack way up the game did look fairly nice, but it seems like you need a 9xx or R9 3xx card in order to play it like that. There was also quite a bit of popin when I was playing, I'd like to say thats due to my low settings, but this being a console port leaves me wondering.\n\nI have heard that there are a number of glitches, I encountered maybe 2 that required a "restart from checkpoint" both were doors not opening. All the other glitches I saw were few and far inbetween, and also resulted in a chuckle. Nothing game breaking was encountered but buyer beware, others have had issues.\n\n"Trigger warning: I played ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy mode"\nGunplay is fairly diverse and enjoyable. There is a usable cover fire system, but it only allows fire from chest high walls, no corner shooting. I found myself switching between the whole selection of guns though my game. Though there are only 6 guns, they have 3 modes. Meaning you are always equiped for any situation. Some modes are worth more than others however, battle rifle outclasses the sniper, auto/pump shotties are better than blunderbuss, etc. I found myself using all of them at least once however. The upgrade system leaves something to be desired however. After beating the game I had only upgraded 6 of my 18 guns. This can be done if you play this game like a Just Cause achievement hunter, but joe blow will likely upgrade the 4 modes he likes the most and get the the end before other upgrades happen. Gun attachments feel like crysis, so theres that. Also, not taking guns from the baddies.\n\nStealth. Its in the game? Don't get seen, use suppressor(pistol only)/crossbow, get lucky and kill the guy shooting at you without tripping the alarm, hide like its asscreed. The game tries to come down like a ton of bricks if you are seen, but the generous hiding spots negate this quickly. Honestly if you want Stealth play the riddick games. This has servicable stealth.\n\nI got into multiplayer once, it seems to be CO-OP only and my game musta had a 700 ping. Good concept though, lets hope there are players for lobbies, as you need 2 to start.\n\nOver all, ignoring my having to play at low settings its a good game. 60 bucks? ehhhh, if you and a few buddies like to play online sure. Campaign is 30-40 bucks, none of the characters are noteworthy or memorable. The worst one does kill themself so thats a plus, even if it is in the name of freedom.","May 22","true","17.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedriftwood/recommended/223100/","thedriftwood","Driftwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedriftwood/","242 products in account","Now that it's been a couple of days and I've been able to properly play for a bit, I feel like now's a good time to revise this review a bit. Originally I left a recommended review in hopes to counter-act the completely idiotic influx of first-minute nay-sayers, complaining that the game was broken on a technical level; so don't expect me to talk about optimization and what-have-you with this review. Mainly I'm going to focus on the content itself, the gameplay, and the narrative, so here-goes.\n\nFirst up, the game's narrative revolves around the idea that the U.S. has fallen under the control of a fantastically powerful North Korea, an idea somewhat far-fetched, especially for the first game where we were supposed to believe that Kim Jong Un led a successful military campaign that swallowed up the whole world. However, this game actually rewrites the original game's story, in fact, I would even go so far as to say this game shouldn't even be considered at all part of the first's canon, in fact, this is more a do-over from last time to fix the original's mistakes; that's a good thing, in case you were wondering. But I digress, Homefront: The Revolution's rewrite ditches the concept of the U.S. losing a pew-pew fight with North Korea, and instead adopts a rather competently thought out economic downfall scenario in it's stead. For some, this scenario may still be farfetched, but the fact that it's better thought out than the idea of the United States military being defeated by the N.K.A. in conventional warfare... well, needless to say it deserves quite a bit of merit, considering the subject matter.\nSo, you begin the game as Ethan Bradberry Brady, a proverbial nobody who's caught the eye of the local resistance cell's top dog, some Benjamin Walker, and are apparently about to meet up with him for some unknown reason before the safehouse you're in gets attacked by the K.P.A. (Korean People's Army). After an interrogation scene that leads to your rescue by this Benjamin Walker, which leaves him with a nasty leg-wound, things start to spiral downhill rather fast as you get introduced to the game's world, solving a few puzzles to advance the plot, which ultimately ends with Walker's capture before you manage to escape underground and happen upon another mass of the local resistance cell, thus beginning your adventure.\nOne of the first things I noticed about this game is the connect between people loyal to the K.P.A., and those that belong to the resistance. What do I mean by this? Well, in the first game your enemy was a faceless pack of genocidal asians who shot mothers and fathers in the face right in front of their kids before dumping the bodies into huge mass graves, then, when all was said and done, they'd celebrate with a night of napalming an entire town. Of course, some might think that such a situation promotes fear-mongering and bigotry towards North Koreans, but for someone like me who isn't blind to the fact that genocide and mass graves are things that are very much still around in this day and age, the premise wasn't really that ridiculous.\nHowever, where as that relationship between the invading force and the population was spurred on by the fact that the K.P.A. was occupying the U.S. amidst an open war with the U.S. government, allowing for belivability in the idea that all enemies are militaristic ghestapo thugs wanting to crush all resistance... Well, such a scenario can't really happen in this game, considering the North Koreans are supposed to be a "relief force," helping the United States out of it's economic strife, supposedly, while trying to get good marks from the U.N. As such, most K.P.A. forces you find will be made up of actual Americans who sympathize with the occupational forces, and concepts like genocide and murder take a back seat to simple reeducation camps and acts of police brutality; basically, the situation is much more docile, and less-likely to upset Tumblr.\nRegardless of this fact, though, this story does not have many sides, as you need to remember this game is about a revolutionary force fighting for their homeland, as such, it's very biased to the side of the resistance.\n\nSo, now that the narrative is out of the way, let's move on to the game itself: It's really good. Kek, but seriously trying to explain the gameplay without gushing too much is going to be difficult, so bear with me a bit.\nWhat's readily apparent is that the game is open world, which can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. A lot of games tend to fall flat on their face due to having an open world, mainly utilizing large, open spaces that are nothing more than set-pieces which do nothing to suppliment any gameplay. Homefront: The Revolution actually accounts for this, believe it or not, as every single building, alleyway, and street seems to offer something new and useful as you make your way through war-torn Philladelphia on your crusade of righteousness. The locations are designed with, shall I say, "fluidity of movement" in mind, which is perfect for trying to escape patrols as you sprint around the corner, into an alleyway before baseball sliding under a broken fence and ultimately climb up onto and begin jumping from rooftop to rooftop in a bid to escape; it's really exciting at times. On top of that, the locations are rather small, which is great, truly, as it allows a great deal of detail and focus on the important aspects that makes each sector unique, all the while keeping you from being overwhelmed by useless, needless side-fluff. As a side note, irony, it should be taken into account that there are indeed side missions, things like bulletin jobs for extra cash, taking over enemy strongholds to expand your influence, sabotaging equipment, finding radios, etc. But, unlike some games that would try to sell you the concept that doing these things are crucial to better your character and unlock new things, well, this game doesn't really shove that down your throat too much. Rather, you'd simply do these things because it's convenient for you, and the developers have done a fantastic job to make them as minimally monotonous as possible. Mainly, the two types of side missions you'll be working on are "strikes" (stronghold takeovers), and "hearts and minds," First-off, "strikes" pit you against an area's stronghold and it's garrison, your job being to take care of an objective inside the fort at your own liesure, letting a time-skip play out, and then leaving you to continue on some hours later after the resistance has set up shop in their new digs. This lets you unlock new respawn zones and shops, as well as providing you with points that you'll use to purchase upgrade kits and new tools to expand your available arsenal. The othe type of side mission, which is actually a by-product of doing "strikes," is "hearts and minds," basically, this is the prospect of winning over the opinion of the general populace, geting them to rise up against the North Korean occupation. This is achieved by doing many different things, and is actually a lot more enjoyable and fluid than I had imagined it would be, as you often rack up points towards the success of this project by 'drum-roll' playing the game, of all things. No hunting collectibles, no "5 out of 9 objectives completed," just straight, glorious game that lets YOU decide how and when things will happen.\n\nSo, that's really all I have to say about that, I'd planned to type out more, as this game has a LOT of fresh ideas and concepts it brings to the table. But, Steam's abysmal word-count won't allow me to do such, so I'll have to hope what's here is sufficient enough for the average reader. My final verdict is that I bought two copies of this game, both with the season pass for me and my brother; we haven't regretted it one bit.","May 17","true","16.1"," 17 of 42 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","17","42","3","3"

There are now two diverse groups of gamers.  You have a core of what I call hard core PC games then you have the consolized group. The consolized group are looking for something completely different than your old school hard core PC gamer.  They want snow flake movie quatlity story lines where thery are the center of attention, extreme NPC close ups with 15 minute cut scenes, lots of dance dance revolution type combat scenarios, and they usually have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC's that cant run games that push technology so they are always crying about peformance.  Now they might read this and say "no we dont, we just a game thats fun". BUT if it has to have ALL that fluffy crap to be considered fun then your are consolized.\n\nThen you have the traditional PC gamer, like me, that wants games like homefront with beautifully rendered game world, check, open world play, check, minimal to the point story line, check, and tons and tons of amazing gun play.\n\nThis game delivers all this in spades, one of the best shooters I have played in a long long time.  And with a computer built for GAMING not f-ing facebook, I'm pulling well over 100FPS on high settings, no slow downs zero stuttering.\n\nWith Homefront sometimes I feel like Im playing a Half Life 2 style game with better graphics an an open ended world that I can just run around and find trouble in.  AI is escalting so your always challenged. And nightmare mode with auto aim assist off feels just about right for an experienced PC gamer.  Though it could be a tad harder.\n\nThis is the Cry Engine so it runs amazing and the level design is simply astonishing.  The attention to detail is amazing.\n\nIve had no bugs no broken quests nothing to get in the way of the fun, just a fantastic shooter being torn about by the console influenced derps.","May 28","true","24.2"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

I have a 970 Strix and a i5 and i had smooth 60fps in ultra settings all the way. The Npc's also seemed fairly aware and not "stupid" as some might say, for the dificulty i was playing in.\nOverall i really enjoyed this game and i recommend you ignore the stupid steam reviews that say the had performance issues (i dont know if youve noticed but everybody has a 2000/3000$ computer on the internet).\nIf you like Far Cry then you should totally buy this one, the gameplay is almost the same and the story is really good. The overall atmosphere of the game is also great, it makes you really feel like part of a gerilla especially on the later zones where you have to sneak away from guards, etc, and sabotage various things so you can take advantage of them against the enemy.\n9/10- A really good time.","May 20","true","15.4"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","7","21","3","0"

Once I pickl up the brick Im unable to do anything else with it besides set it down. Restarted the game and the problem persists. I will be asking for a refund I guess, I dont know what else to do.

Well some how it only comes across in bits and pieces with this game everything feels a bit slapped together part c fits in slot b game mechanics from the brief ammount of time I had with it this was the overwhelming impression I picked up. There is so much potential for fans of far cry style open world games you will constantly see something that piques your interest, that can grind out of you "just one more base" but it never seems to go beyond the surface jenky gunplay and impossible to control movement constantly pull you out of the game. (you aim like a coked up orangutan, and move around the map like a coked up ice hockey player on jet skates.) that you will always have to goad your self to satiate that urge for just one more.

But if you can look past those, the graphics are nice-ish (with my system, I have to run it on minimal graphics, and even then it isn't the worst), the animations in my opinion are actually really good and the gunplay seems fairly solid, especially the heavy sniper.\n\nAnother part of the game I really enjoy is the stealth. I've seen a few reviews where they give it ♥♥♥♥ but to me it seems like the AI are smart enough to track you down and at the same time, not being super-cosmic Ethan Brady sensing Norks. The takedowns are fun and actually pretty brutal, but to be honest, a little more detail (blood/gore) wouldn't have been bad.\n\nThe idea that you are guerilla fighters is really embedded through the fact that you are definitely not invincible. The hit and run style of fighting is almost your only option in the first 3 areas of Philly, until you gear up a little more.\n\nAll up I would say pick this game up when it's a little cheaper maybe, but if you can snag it on sale then you will absolutely enjoy yourself.","May 21","true","12.9"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","4","15","2","0"

I didn't notice any graphical problems.  The only bugs I encountered were a moment of dodgy clipping, but otherwise I've spent probably a good dozen hours in this without issues.\n\nThe game itself?  It's like an urban Far Cry game done right.\n\nThe mobility is a little restricted compared to other FC games (your vehicle options consist exclusively of a dirt-bike, there is no wingsuiting or parachuting or zip-lining/grappling), but the storytelling* is on point and is done with more consistency, depth, persistence and detail than the FC games.  The same holds true of nearly every mechanic they've cared to explore.\n\nWeapon upgrades are varied, relatively-easily acquired, and plentiful enough that you don't acquire them all in the first hour.  Gear upgrades (for increased stealth, movement speed, etc) are similar.\n\nStandard UbisoftGame(tm) 'collectible for the sake of collectible' fare is kept to a minimum, too.  Nearly everything you scout out and obtain has a purpose.\n\nTaking strongholds has a real noticable effect on the surrounding environments, and sometimes comes with believable, understandable requirements that make sense and change it up.  The free-for-all shoot on sight red zones are basically discrete maps taking place in bombed-out industrial areas, and the residential centres ('yellow zones') involve a more visible and more involved civilian population with a heavier peace-keeper presence, and your guerrilla terrorist actions can really visibly change the entire mood and theme of these zones in subtle stages that are very impressive.\n\nStandard stuff: Pros are gorgeous graphics, rich detail to the environments, solid mechanics, great pacing and difficulty. Cons are some janky UI quirks, eye-rollingly jingoistic story that hasn't done anything unpredictable yet, and rumours of bugs and performance issues that I personally haven't seen yet, so they're hard to take seriously.\n\nOverall, it's a net win.  I'm really enjoying this game.\n\n* And while it's better told than most video games, holy ♥♥♥♥ it's a TERRIBLE story full of foul, unjustified nationalistic jingoism - because MURRICA! - without any signs of self-awareness... maybe it's too subtle for me, but I'm not sure if the developers are actually intending for players to realize that they're playing the bad guys.  The plot revolves around a technologically-advanced and politically-savvy North Korean conquering the world's economy through technological superiority. America's disastrous foreign and domestic policies see it fighting wars in the middle east and other places it shouldn't be, having it bite them in the ♥♥♥ with massive losses thanks to terrorists/rogue states finally getting access to a nuke, while domestically its indulgent citizens grow used to lives of luxury they don't deserve thanks to it being primarily founded on loans from other countries they have no intention of paying back.  When overreach goes too far and the US collapses in on itself due to gross mismanagement, there is rioting, rampant unemployment and crime,  and gross inequality to the point that people are starving.  When it all gets too much and the US government tells Korea (its primary creditor at this stage) that it intends to default on its MASSIVE debts, the Koreans decide that's not acceptable, and they will manage the poorly-managed country for themselves, and extract natural resources from the land to make up for the staggering US debt.  "Who's going to make us?" the US cries, and the Koreans reply, "We will," by disabling via back-doors (eyeroll) in the advanced military tech the US bought (but - and this is important - didn't actually PAY for; see above) from Korea.  Cue a process of humanitarian aid for a nation that needed it, accompanied by an occupation which is benevolent to those who embrace it, and harsh on the terrorists who murder the occupiers. Go figure. If I was on a peacekeeping mission to provide aid and support to a nation that needed it and the generosity was repaid by watching the natives murder my brothers, I'd be a lot saltier about it than the Koreans are in this.  There's really no question about it, from the premise.  American Freedom Fighters are the bad guys. This point is really rammed home when the first people you meet after the intro are a couple hicks who want to kill you on the spot before they even ask any questions about why a fellow American is in Resistance tunnels, and who think an appropriate method for delivery to HQ is via concussion.  Delivery to an ex-con psychopath who holds high rank, and whose primary form of intelligence-gathering is 'torture first, ask questions later - basic questions such as, 'are you part of the resistance and do you have any proof or can anyone in our organization verify this'?  Which is exactly what happens when a non-psychopath steps in and takes your ID card and verifies it.  All while you sit there with a concussion that a medical professional expresses concern about, but whose concerns are dismissed by everyone except the patient.  These are horrible, horrible people, to a man.  Even the most inoffensive of these jingoistic cliches tries to rally their terrorist friends by noting that while the NK peace-keepers may be better fed, better trained, have better weapons and armour, better vehicles, better drones, better equipment, better support, better comms networks, somehow every US terrorist is worth ten NK's... because Americans are naturally superior.  (Despite getting their asses handed to them so badly that they actually 'lost their country'.) Yeah.  It's Manifest Destiny In the Face Of Evidence.  It's pretty telling how every time you over-take a stronghold, it goes from slick, pristine, well-mainted order to a graffiti-tagged, junk-filled hell-hole.  'You Can't Tell Me To Clean Up My Room You're Not My Real Dad', the game.  So the story conceit is crap and you play a bad guy, working with a bunch of other unlikeable bad guys, but are supposed to root for them because... otherwise there wouldn't be much of a game.

I notice more friendly AI spawning and taking on the enemy AI and strongholds, so in a way , it's better than Far Cry I guess.\n1 gun, 3 choices - this makes up for the lack in overall type of weapons, especially if you take the whole game background in consideration.\nDeveloper can still come out with patches and expansion to make it better ( fingers crossed ).\nSP campaign was a good time sink, especially if you play on hard, like most FPS players do. Well, if you played it on easy , of course you would complain it's boring.

I must say the open world game play is amazing you can recruit resistant fighters to fight with you in the battle to reclaim the fallen America from the clutches of the Korean Agressors. weapons can customised to your fighting needs. Taking over strongholds would help the resistant side immensly in the war for Aamerica. This is one action packed game you must own. It is very addictive and cutting edge. The first game was more story driven whereas this game focuses more on the open world fighting aspect.\n\nI still have a fair way to go with this game. If you love taking down the oppressor, But love Samsung phones. This is the game to get.\n\nThe scary reality is that the North Korean war could happen in the distant future. What you see  in the news today  is a scary reality. It could happen to us in real life.\n\nWe must stand up for what we believe in and to always KEEP ON FIGHTING.\n\n10/10 MUST HAVE ON PC.","May 22","true","13.9"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","0"

This means the map works off of the same basis as Deus Ex and Thief (Reboot) where you're given a map which is segmented into zones which are traversed via loading screens if entered.\nThis does not lessen the experience, though. As the areas are much varied from run down industrial areas, poverty stricken backstreets and pristine utopias.\n\nThe gun-play is well thought out keeping the amount of weapons to a minimum but allowing to "mod" the weapon into a complete different firearm, for example you can use a pistol and turn it into a machine pistol which treats you with an oddly satisfying animation of taking the weapon apart and assembling this said firearm.\n\nIn terms of performance, flawless. With v-sync I'm running at 60fps as the norm, and without I'm hitting the high 160fps with no stutter. This was tested at "very high" settings.\nI'm using a 980ti and an i7 6700k 4ghz.\n\nPros:\nGun play\nArea transition\nNice graphics\nStory gets by okay\nSatisfying motorcycle gameplay (What's better than riding a dirtbike through apartment blocks?)\n\nCons:\nStealth seems to lack (You can peak over objects but not peak around the side?)\nThere's a lot of room for a "parkour" feel they could have exploited but seems to be vaccant\nWeapons can get boring after a while, which is a downside to the gun play\n\n8/10\nI don't see why this game is getting a lot of stick. They put a lot of work into this and I'm overly surprised they managed to pull this game out of dev hell. Not a lot of games survive that ♥♥♥♥.","May 21","true","7.7"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

I also don't often pre-order games but I was super stoked for Homefront: The Revolution. It didn't dissapoint. I am in love with this game and as someone who rarely finds playing games multiple times is worth while this game I promise you I will beat repeatedly. I already beat it once. Took me 29 hours to do on hardened/normal. There is repeatability there. I rushed through the first time to get the story but the second time I will take the time to explore everything, find everything, and do  all of the side missions. The game is challenging at times and easy at times. Sometimes you feel out of control and sometimes you feel completely in control. It has a beautiful balance between open world and story. The plot twists are well done. I do have to say one of my favorite parts though is the fact that you can see the effect you are having on the population. Your actions change the demeaner of the citizens in step by step progressions as you do more to encourage them. The Red Zones are run and gun where as the yellow zones are are more Assassins Creedish with a soldierly spin. Lets just say this game grabbed me, sucked me in, and I thought about it constantly when I wasn't playing. Honestly in my opinion anybody complaining about this game should have known not to buy it before it came out. They produced the game they promised and if you pre-order a game you should expect bugs. I had less then I expected. Although I will say at the moment I have not played multiplayer for I am unable to.

It has a pretty long single player and an above great co-op experience. Yes I know know it doesn't have a player vs player multiplayer game mode. Does it need one honestly? No it does not. Besides it can't beat the first person shooter multiplayers that are already out.\n\nI think it has a decent story but to be blunt there is no character depth. The most interesting person I've met in this wanted to kill me thinking I was a spy. Though each new non-player character is unique they just lack, well character. You know defining traits, fears, and ambitions. Hell I would have settled for some personality in more than just two or three of them.\n\nI love the molding while on the move, especially the "Freedom Launcher", goodness that's fun to shoot.\n\nOh by the way Deep Silver, ♥♥♥♥ your airship.\n\nMy last complaint, let the player character talk! You don't get to customize him at all, so let him freaking talk. The utter silence from your character except co-op is annoying.\n\nLast thing you should know, embrace the old pirate tradition, "fight to run away". Running can save your life. Which there also isn't a heavy penalty for dying like you'd think, you just lose a couple things of loot.\n\nAll in all, buy it for a decent story or co-op and you'd be happy.","May 22","true","16.4"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

That is all really...\n\n\nThe only thing in my opinion holding this game back is depth. Its like everything they did was only 50%... they decided to go with quantity over quality.\n\nAlthough this game has its flaws(which is many) I couldnt keep myself away from it. The world was believable all the way until the final sequence. The story is cool, but I think the way they decided to engage it was a mistep. This game would've been better without the 'open world' mechanics. they could have invested more in a deeper rich story through linear well thought out levels.\n\nAt one point the game gives you a decision to kill someone or let them live. This game could've done so much more with real decision making mechanics to effect the outcome.\n\nThings get repetative. You do the same thing in every district to further branch the story which was just annoying. On top of that it feels like you... just you... are the revolution. Most of the time you'll be doing things alone, even when there is all out anarchy and everyone is running around shooting the KPA you'll be lonewolfing through the mission. You can recruit 2 resistance members but they are kind of useless and sometimes end up walking into your bullets.\n\nThe thing they got right with this game though is the mood. Everything is a wreck, it really feels and looks like America went to ♥♥♥♥ when you walk throughout these areas. The devs really outdid themselves with the level design. The level at the pier with the two aircraft carriers just rusting away was one of the coolest things ive seen in a video game.","May 22","true","10.3"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","1","11","0","1"

So far into the game I like the gameplay, atmosphere, and concept. After adjusting the setting to the GeForce Experience recommended setting, which basically recommended me the lowest settings the game floats well and the graphics is still beautiful on my seasoned gaming laptop (Intel Core i7-4700MQ with GTX765M).\n\nThe story is credible enough, taking into account alternative history setting. Some glitches here and there, that are likely fixable with patches. Gameplay works well as soon you get used to it. This is a game you must play on the premises of the game. It is not a pure stealth game, and not a pure kill’em-all game, but something in-between. Get used to that and it is fun.\n\nSince there are so many bad reviews I feel I must defend myself, so I will do. If you want DOOM, get DOOM. If you want COD, get COD. If you want The Division, get The Division. They are probably better if those are the game you really want. This game requires something else from you, namely to play as an inferior guerilla soldier in hostile environment with superior power enemies. Tactics are required.\n\nFor me this game seems like a perfect warm up to Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and Dishonored 2. Give it a chance if you share my motivation.\n","May 25","true","14.9"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

As for the game itself I really liked it I know critics are giving it bad reviews I would say most of them have never played the game and just judging it based on what they see. Yes there are a lot saying fps dips and what not but remember this game is running on Cryengine 5, the new Crytek engine. Remember in 2007 when Crysis launched? Most computers could barely run it I would say the same thing here the engine is to advanced for what current hardware is capable of doing that most people would have. Their would be few exceptions those who run triple or quad CrossFire/SLI, but most people probably. Run a single gpu or duo gpu's is it a good story that is something I feel yes and no the idea of the whole series is great. Story could have been maybe another hour or two but I would not knock, a star off for it because it is an open world game and if I wanted the story element and not an open world I would not have bought it. Visually this game is very impressive minor details are there that lack in other AAA games now a days but. Used in exist back when the cod series was becoming popular before it became a yearly cash grab release franchise. As for recomending this game I would say yes because I think if Deep Silver, had a bigger budgement in the next series then I think they could defintely make a better game and spend time working out a really intriguing story. Their is even mention about what happened to Koas Studios, and this franchise changing hands to Crytek, then being sold to Deep Silver. That is something I did not expect since most developers for games if they change studios there is no mention about that anywhere in the game itself.","May 22","true","17.1"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","2","15","2","0"

I thought Battleborn was bad, but this game is absolutely horrible. I friggin' despise this game. The shooting mechanics SUCK. The weapons SUCK. The enemies swarm even worse than the cops in GTA. Do not buy this game. The rebels who fight alongside you only serve to get in your way and alert bases if you're trying to do stealth. Just absolutely horrible game on every single aspect. The only reason I bought this was because it's set in Philly and it really brings the city down by using Philly as its setting. You never have enough ammo in this game. I have no idea what actually kills a soldier. I've blown entire clips into someone's head and nothing happened, then I put two rounds into their legs or some other part and they fall over dead. There's also no targeting reticle on the screen, so who the hell knows if you're aiming at the target you have to aim down sights for every single shot. ♥♥♥♥ this game. This is the last time I buy from a third party site. Next time I'll buy from Steam so I can get a refund when a game developer takes a ♥♥♥♥ on me this badly.","May 19","false","1.8"," 11 of 42 people (26%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","26","11","42","4","0"

I have an Alienware.... I-7...256  ge-force video... blah blah blah.... It's a damn good computer worth nearly $2k...\n\nI saw this game in the featured section.... read the description... saw the trailers... thought to myself... Hey... this looks like fun....\n\nSo I paid for the game AND season pass package... cuz I hate getting screwed by greedy developers who wanna be paid every time they take a ♥♥♥♥... n also want a pat on the back BECAUSE they took a ♥♥♥♥... even though their ♥♥♥♥ still STINKS like ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBut ... whatever.... I bought the game...\n\nfirst thing I notice is.... thirty FREAKING six gig!!! 36 gig...  3   6    ... WTF?? Am I downloading the library of congress????  I immediately wonder if the game code was written in visual basic... or hieroglyphic or some other ancient forgotten language.\n\nAfter  3 1/2 ridiculously long hours on a very stable high speed internet connection that easily runs WOT and multiple other FPS's.... Homefront is installed and ready to play.\n\nSo I double click the play button n wait to dive in...  tick tock..... tick tock....    did I click it once?? or twice??? .... it must have been once... it's been a minute or two n still nothing... I mean .... NOTHING... a black.... blank screen.....I'll click it again..... oh ... wait.... it's starting to do something.... I see... something ... its faint.... choppy?!?!?... garbled music....   some sort of weird cut scene??? intro movie???  I think to myself.... I bought a game right???? not some narrated cartoon movie / graphic novel????\n\nFinally after about ten minutes of watching this choppy.... blurry.... grossly out of sync audio ..... Intro???.... I get to do something.... .... .... press V.... yup.... I got to press the V button on my keyboard....       36 gigs.... 3 1/2 hours to download and install.... ten minutes of watching a sub standard cut scene / movie / intro / pointless waste of time..... and pile of money later.... and I get to press the V button.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen a more blatant middle finger from a game developer before.... these guys should have gone into business making high school prom videos rather than making video games...\n\nI'd ask for my money back for this steaming piece of dogshit but I figure I'd have a better chance of winning every lottery in every city in every country....

Running this game on an Alienware X51 R2 the graphics were set on high and the game still had shading errors and "head loss" for random characters. After changing the setings to medium or low this shoud be resolved. Gamplay wise, everything can be killed with bullets, shooting at the back of an armoured car blows with up with 1 mag. The A.I sucks the rarely runs for cover (and or) charges straight into battle, they stand and shoot. The storyline is interesting, but in 2 hours I have made little effort to pursue it, due to the fact that there is no connection between the characters and little to no interaction with you. I dont enjoy the game saves my progress, but im sure I will get used to it.\n\nPutting all that aside, the gun modification is "Revolutionary" (compared to fallout) considering I can turn a pistol into a Uzi. The "sleath mechanic" is in working order, I personally love sneaking behind Norks and preforming a takedown rather than a gunfight. As for cover, peaking all work well for stealth, as blindfire keeps you in the game in firefights, aslo gotta love the Day/Night cycle. There is a slight desire to save Walker but, what is FAR more ineresting is the massive map, far larger that skyrim(with guns).  It will take hours/days to explore the whole thing. The Districts are divided by color, red, yellow, and green. Each of these districts will determine if you get into a massive firefight or if you can walk to your destination. I found that being able to form a "Strike Squad" by recruiting rebel A.I.s is a feature I have not seen since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I imagine as I progress in the story more and attempt the multiplayer/co-op you will start to feel like a "Revolutionary."\n\nAs the game sits now, its buggy, but not unplayable, the people in the USA will deal with it for 3 days while the Devs work on a patch in time for the May 20 release. Its problems from the first game can be overlooked by this new addition into a plagued series.\n\nIf I had to rate it as it is now... 7/10 - would recommend","May 17","true","14.3"," 38 of 216 people (18%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","18","38","216","13","4"
