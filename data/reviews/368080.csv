Made by a small studio based in Africa, no less. To be honest, I only expected to be involved in this to own a quaint and quirky little game in my collection. I mean, the Kickstarter was a success, sure, but it was only a marginal success with just enough funding to get this game through the door.\n\nWhat I did NOT expect was a full-fledged powerhouse RPG with very strong cultural thematics and combat controls that AAA studios could learn a thing or two from.\n\nI'm 3 hours in deep and I feel that I have barely scratched the surface of this game. The world seems huge and simple combos are pretty easy to pull off. I believe, with more practice, I could probably kill a strong enemy without it touching the ground after launching it into the air.\n\nNow, for the criticisms; constructive, of course.\n\n1) I've praised a lot about the combat because, outside of it, the controls need some improvement and the environment needs more interactivity. During the prologue phase, moving the good prince around was a chore as the analog stick was way too sensitive. Truth be told, I was expecting that kind of level of control throughout the game because my expectations wasn't way up there in the first place, expecially with a fledgling studio. I am pleasantly surprised that it got WAY better after the prince became a king and had a wardrobe change. I guess it's good to be the king and not wearing pants helped.\n\n2) I'm not sure about the Francais dialogues but the English ones were suffering... a lot. I could still get what the characters were talking about but there was quite a handful of missing spaces and punctuations in the sentences. Loads of grammar mistakes as well. I understand that English is not their native tongue but it's not mine either so...\n\n3) I only started to REALLY understand the level of detail and attention put into the combat mechanics after spending 2 hours in the game. Seriously, guys, a tutorial AFTER beating a boss character? I should be glad that you tried something different but... geez...\n\nAnyway, get this game if you're into RPGs, Action RPGs, African culture & music, like to pull off sick combos, a Fighting Game enthusiast who wants to tinkle your toes in the RPG pool or an RPG afficionado who wants to try a little Street Fighter action wihout all the nitty gritty technicalities.\n\nNot recommended for grammar nazis until they further proofread and edit the stuff though.","April 15","true","3.9"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","37","45","2","5"

The setting is vibrantly colorful, a refreshing change from the industry standard of Medieval Fantasy Europe. The art is beautiful, with excellent character designs and gloriously painted environments. Combat is solid, simple to learn and rewarding to master. The writing is excellent, with good characters and an excellent overarching story. The translation is rough in places, and it has a fair number of crashes. But even when the language barrier reared its ugly head, or a crash knocked me back to the desktop, I found the game's story, characters, and combat were more than enough to keep me loading it right back up again. Also, every time I found a crash or bug, I posted on the discussion boards for the game and received prompt responses from the development team, and they have been unflinchingly professional. As of this moment, I have 24.3 hours of play in this game, and all of that has been in one weekend. I found it impossible to walk away from once I had gotten into it. Though yet unpolished, make no mistake: this game is a gem.","April 17","true","24.3"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/368080/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","I was a Kickstarter backer for Aurion during its campaign but I had heard of and had interest in it for some time beforehand. I backed it in part because the devs, Kiro’o Games, are from Cameroon and basically the whole continent of Africa has practically a nonexistent presence in the industry so I wanted to help out. It also looked good and the game was a clear labor of love, the devs have been making this game for well over a decade and they all taught themselves.\n\nAurion takes place in a fantasy world inspired by African cultures ranging from Cameroon, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Saharan nations such as Mali and Niger. The two protagonists are the newly crowned and married King and Queen of the peaceful and isolated island nation of Zama, Enzo and Erine Kori-Odan. During their wedding/coronation day Erine’s brother Ngarba invades the city with his army and overthrows his sister and brother-in-law. Now exiles, Enzo and Erine are thrusted into the rest of the world in order to find a way to get their kingdom back.\n\nAurion is an action RPG more in the vein of JRPGs, it plays like a cross between Tales of Symphonia and a sidescrolling beatemup. You play as Enzo, who’s primary attacks is his sword, but you eventually gain special moves as well as Aurionic Legacies, super modes that grant powerful magical attacks such as Water, Fire, and Darkness through Enzo’s spear. Erine acts as straight mage, teleporting into the battle when you summon her, she can both heal and act as an offensive mage. The combat is fast paced and fun, though perhaps the tutorial could be a bit clearer. (Like I didn’t realize that I could charge my MP until a few hours into the game.) There is also problems with FPS drops, mainly when bosses do their super moves, which can cause you to get hit by them. The ending area also can tank the FPS if you do certain things and can cause the game to crash. Those are things that can be fixed though and aren’t a major detriment.\n\nThe writing is similar to the JRPG mold but it’s executed well. Though for the first half of the game the English translation is pretty rough. Kiro’o is Cameroonian so French is their stronger language so the translation starts off janky. For the most part it’s still decipherable, but there’s a lot of grammatical errors and stuff like that. The translation does actually get much better as the game goes on though. Kiroo is also currently working on improving it, so it’s not a deal breaker at all. The setting is also a pretty neat one a nice deviation from the stock Western European fantasy well that games tend to draw from.\n\nWhile it may not rival the two non-Japanese JRPGs greats currently on Steam, LISA and Undertale, Aurion is still a really nice game well worth playing. Hopefully the game will be a success for Kiro’o because they deserve it after all the years of hard work and dedication.","April 24","true","16.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/368080/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================According to its Steam game page, Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan is a "2D African Fantasy Action-RPG".\n\nIn the game, you play Enzo, the recently crowned and newly wed king of Zama, and a master of martial arts and the spiritual magic of Aurion. On your wedding day (and possible coronation day; I'm a bit confused on that point), Zama is attacked by a rival tribe led by none other than your new brother in law, and you and your queen are exiled from Zama.\n\n\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The two-dimensional backgrounds for the most part are quite lovely. The characters, too, generally look quite nice when standing still, but there's something a bit off about some of the more active animations, such as running or dancing: they just don't look quite right.\n\nCombat animations are generally pretty good, although they do move quite fast, making the combat sometimes a bit hard to follow, especially when using some of your Aurion attacks.\n\nSound - Music is good, with an African feel to it. I particularly like the title screen music. Sounds are satisfactory, if nothing out of the ordinary. There's no speech, with all dialogue being text instead.\n\nGameplay - Gameplay in Aurion is neatly split into two sections: the exploration, or plot-advancement sections; and the combat sections. The former involves wandering around nicely drawn 2D backgrounds, picking up occasional items and talking to people. The latter is a sort of traditional 2D fighter, ala Street Fighter, but typically involving you fighting a group of cloned enemies.\n\nI'm a fan of role-playing games, both 'pen and paper' and computer-based, and unfortunately I think the tag is mis-applied here. The only RPG-like element is an increase in numerical characteristics when you 'go up a level', but there's no control over it and no information provided on what any of the characteristics do, making this whole aspect of the game a bit pointless; the numbers could just be hidden from the user without losing anything. It's not even really like a 'console RPG' or 'JRPG', as the real-time nature of the combat doesn't really fit those genres either.\n\nThe game does have some JRPG-like village roaming, complete with searching for useful items in Aurion's version of a treasure chest, but the only items you can gain are generic ones to increase your combat-related characteristics, restoring health, stamina, etc, when in the combat sections, and those combat sections are much more winnable by button mashing than they are by taking JRPG-like tactics into account. No, to me Aurion is closer to a traditional 2D side scroller like Golden Axe crossed with a 2D fighter like Street Fighter than it is to a role-playing game, with the added non-combat sections most useful for progressing the plot.\n\nThere are some issues, too. The in-game text has some glaringly obvious grammar and spelling problems, as well as a tendency to have words run together, as if the spacing has been stuffed up somehow. Some of the interface tutorials include screenshots -- in French! The plot is a bit all over the place, with too many words that don't mean anything to the average player used without explanation or reference, made worse by the quality of the writing and poor translation. And the loading times between similar levels (or even reloads of the same level) are atrocious, sometimes taking upwards of 20 seconds just to enter a building or load a combat encounter in the same area you've just been exploring. This last issue is probably the most frustrating, as the long waits make playing the game a bit of a chore.\n\nPlaying the game with a keyboard and mouse is pretty painful, too. I'd definitely recommend using a controller for this one.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Beautiful art; characters and backgrounds are both very nicely drawn\n+ Nice music\n+ Interesting original setting\n+ Steam achievements, although there are over 100 of them!\n\nCons:\n- Confusing story made worse by a poor translation and the quality of the writing\n- Awful loading times; some screens will spend more time loading than you'll spend interacting with them\n- It feels like a chore to play\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================I'm torn as to whether to recommend Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan or not. The graphics are beautiful when still, but when they move they don't quite work. The sound is great. The plot is interesting, I think, but hard enough to understand the specifics that I find myself losing interest and just skipping conversations to move the game along. It's disappointing; I'm sure there's a lot here to like, but it's hidden behind a wall of poorly translated text and sentences that just don't make any sense.\n\nOutside of the plot sections the game seems a reasonably solid 2d beat-em-up, but it's not quite what's described on the Steam game page. I can't see more than a very light smattering of role-playing elements, which leaves me with a somewhat complicated fighting game with lovely art and terrible load times. And that's not an 'action RPG' in my book.\n\nI wanted to spend more time with Aurion, as I believe it's supposed to be quite a lengthy game and reviewing it after only a handful of hours seemed like I wasn't giving it enough of a chance, but ultimately I found playing it more work than fun, and all I wanted to do towards the end of my time with it was to play something else. So when I consider that, I just can't bring myself to recommend it.\n\n5/10","April 15","false","5.2"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","40","64","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracohouston/recommended/368080/","Dracohouston","Draco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracohouston/","377 products in account","For lack of a better words to describe what this is, this is a JRPG. It also draws on Shonen genre of manga. It has a structure similar to many of the older japanese RPG games. This is a very vague term to use though, because there are a diverse set of games under that category. Regardless, if you have played that sort of game the gameplay outside combat will be immediately familiar. It even has overworld bits where you walk a tiny sprite between towns.\n\nFinally, I say it is Shonen because it is reminiscent of a certain kind of manga and anime for young males. You pretty much play African Goku. You do not pilot increasingly larger robots but you do sorta gain Stands. Whether that appeals to you or not is a matter of personal preference. If you like badarsery, this game has you covered. Very powerful people perform superhuman feats and have very flashy duels after frankly talking about why they have to fight. A young man discovers himself and his place in the world. Lessons are learned. It is that kind of tale.\n\nThe combat is real time and uses a lot of the mechanics of beat-em-ups and fighting games. While stats improve your performance and your equipment provides some benefit, success in combat relies more on execution, especially early on where you aren't basically the strongest being on the planet.\n\nThat only tells you what this is, and you might have been able to find this out yourself from this store page. What do I think of this game? Well, I really liked it. Taken as a whole, the game is pretty good.\n\nHowever, for fans of JRPGs, some of the parts that make up the game may not rate highly when compared to the greats of that genre. Some play JRPGs to master the systems and break the game, some like a good grind for bigger numbers. In these respects, the game is not particularly strong.\n\nThe mechanic where you can call in your wife to help you do combos is very cool though. It reminds me a little of Marvel vs Capcom. Unfortunately though, you can't reverse those roles to mix things up, with Erine leading the fighting and Enzo assisting (like you would switch between your 3 characters in MvC). While unfortunate, the assist stuff is really cool on its own. Erine is extremely useful and compliments what Enzo does very well.\n\nBut, if you are the sort of person who grinds triple triad cards before getting Ifrit in FF8 you may feel disappointed in that facet of the game. I did not grind once, the fights you end up in just going through the various areas of the game with enemies in it suffices for getting enough power to clear the game.\n\nFor me, this was a positive. I prefer to just get on with the game itself rather than worry if my numbers aren't high enough. The game is more than its combat, Like any JRPG worth its salt it has characters, story arcs and an overarching plot that are interesting and tie the entire package together. I feel this is the strongest part of the game. The story and character writing is great. I actually came into this with low expectations for the writing, but I was very impressed. Unlike the combat, I am confident that fans of Shonen manga and anime will enjoy this.\n\nWhat impressed me most is that the story and characters mesh very well. Each villain is gross in their own way, and have actual reasons for being their particular brand of gross. Each character is easily believable as a product of their era and place in the world. Big political issues are encountered, they are dealt with in a depth I did not expect. The history of the characters and their people is fully explored, from their own actions and guiding philosophies and those of other involved parties, to the material conditions that these spring from. It does this without descending into a morality play. None of it is contrived because it all relates well to the overarching plot, it also serves to give each story arc some flavour. None of the arcs on the way to the conclusion of the plot were weak and forgetable.\n\nIt is quite long for a game with little padding, even though the game lacks time sinks like grinding or optional goals and subplots I ended the game at around a days total play time.  I did talk to pretty much every NPC I could, though. The 2d art and animation is pretty decent for a game of this price range, and there is a lot of it. The music matches the art well, however there aren't as many tracks as big budget JRPGs have. I liked the music but each track is used so often that it is hard to really associate them with any specific location and character.\n\nSo, to sum this all up, this is a solid debut title from a smallish team, I enjoyed it a lot, warts and all. Well worth a playthrough and the price of admission. It might even end up being my personal GOTY for 2016. Good stuff.\n\nedit: I have removed the first paragraph, on localization, to reflect that the english localization is no longer placeholder.","April 22","true","48.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","4"

Suddenly it pops back up on my radar yesterday about 4 hours before release and I'm able to grab it plus the OST(which is awesome by the way!) at the pre-order price! Score right?\n\nYES! Aurion is not only a fun game but a breath of fresh air. The mythology/lore is different from what we usually see and *SPOILERISH* the designs of the outfits are explained in game and make sense! I love little things like that!\n\nTrue, the dialogue(written) isn't perfect but I can look beyond that seeing as how this is an indie company and English isn't their native language(heck, native English speakers have problems am I right?). The comabt isn't hard to grasp but there's different chains/combos you can make that are pretty cool! I'm not that far into the game but what I have seen is stunning.\n\nI am playing with a Xbox One controller which, when the game first starts, they tell you that the game was actually made to be played with a 360 controller so keep that in mind.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinSane059/recommended/368080/","JustinSane059","Dr. JustinSane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinSane059/","1795 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Kiro'o Games for providing the key for review purposes.\nAurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan is the Steam debut and a Kickstarter success story from a small Cameroonian-based Kiro'o Games. While most games we see today mostly takes on the European/western mythology, Aurion opts for an African mythology setting and this alone, in my humble opinion, makes this game a must-play title for indie enthusiasts!\n\nThe story revolves around the last heir of the Kori-Odan family, Prince Enzo of Zama. On the day of his coronation and marriage to Erine Evou of Soma, the royal palace is attacked by his own brother-in-law Ngarba "Rhino" Evou. Defeated and exiled, Enzo and Erine embarks on a journey of self-improvement, looking for support, training his Legacies and ultimately, carved a path to maturity.\n\nThe African culture and influences are prominent from the start as the inspiration comes directly from their music, fashion and myths. Again, this setting is extremely unique and Kiro'o Games did a splendid job in bringing the African cultures to life! From the amazing soundtracks, character designs, depiction of Auriona and even combat stances, Aurion is on-point!\n\nNext, we have the gameplay. The game revolves around two parts, one in Exploratory and the other Combat mode. In Exploration mode, you can move Enzo in 8 directions across the map and allows you to interact with the locals, explore and even do a mild platforming action (climbing walls, for example). However, Enzo will only face 2 direction, i.e. either he's facing right of left, and at some point, this feels really weird. In Combat mode, the stage will center around the traditional 2D setting with some maps allowing you to jump on top of floating platforms for strategic mobility. This is actually the meat of the game because the combat in Aurion is surprisingly deep technical wise! You have the standard normal combo which you can chain after doing a Penetrating hit (think of it like a dash with piercing effect) and you can basically juggle your enemy if you're creative enough. The other main point is the Aurionic system. In battle, Enzo can invoke his Aurionic spirit and proceed to have exceptional abilities with the eventual Ultimate Legacy move. This is simply amazing since not only it's an eye candy to look at but the move itself is powerful enough to sweep the whole battlefield! This comes with a limitation since using any techniques consumes AP and AP are regenerated by focusing in the heat of battle (pressing down in combat). Erine will help in battle by healing Enzo with her spells so careful planning is needed on how you would utilize every abilities that you possess in combat.\n\nEven with all the praises, Aurion does have a few flaws on it's plate. The main thing that bothered me the most with the game is how clunky and floaty the movement sometimes feel. For example, when jumping, Enzo will skyrocket across the map. I know Enzo is very agile but this just feels out of place and to make it worse, if you ran out of stamina before jumping, you have no choice but to float helplessly while the enemy quickly repositioned themselves. The hitbox is also an issue as sometimes during exploring you'll hit an invisible wall, even though the screen only shows it as a small ledge. In combat, the enemy hitbox is, not sure what's the proper word, pretty much inconsistent. The effect on screen clearly shows that it hits the enemy but the hit isn't registered and Enzo will end up hitting air repeatedly like a fool. The game also crashes on me quite a few times. In my small amount of game time with Aurion, I think I've had around 4 or 5 separate crashes in multiple instances.\n\n\nPROS\nAbsolutely gorgeous setting! The game opts for a charming comic book-esque art style and this fits in perfectly with the game.\nRich in lore with detailed explanation to various points of interests in the game.\nThe combat system is deep and highly satisfying. There's nothing better than landing a 2-digit combo while juggling your opponent in the air!\nThe game is pretty much linear but the amount of contents are commendable.\nSteam basic features are all present (including Trading Cards, which they haven't updated the Store page yet) except for Cloud saving.\nThe soundtracks are amazing! It pays to just stand a while and listen to the tunes.\nNEUTRAL\nThe map movement could be a lot better. Navigating with a controller feels too sluggish at times and makes it tedious to study the map.\nGraphical options are pretty much barebones although it works quite well with how the game is.\nThe game localizes to French and the English translation, while not bad by any means, can lead to some confusing wording.\nCONS\nFloaty and clunky movements. This might sound like a small issue but I noticed that it dampened my experience to quite some degree.\nInaccurate hitboxes can lead to frustrating combat sequences.\nI've received several hard crashes in my short period of gameplay.\nMinor typos here and there.\nThe game can't be Alt+Tab properly as the window cannot be forced to minimized unless closed.\nEven with the few technical flaws and clunkiness of it's control, Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan is truly a unique experience and in my personal view, it deserves a great 4 / 5! With a few polish here and there, I'm confident that Aurion can be a definite gem of 2016.\nIf you enjoy playing 2D side-scrolling action games with minor platforming thrown in the mix or just looking to try something out of the ordinary, then I have no trouble recommending it, even with the full price tag! Additionally, it's a no-brainer to pick it up if the game ever went below $10.\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

Because of that, it’s so rare to find a game that has a unique setting, but Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan manages to accomplish that. Aurion is set in Africa, a setting woefully neglected by developers over the years, and as such is quite refreshing to see. Aurion relishes its African roots (the developers are from Cameroon) and creates a believable setting and perhaps most importantly wants you to learn something. Outside of an academic setting it’s rare that a game actually wants to teach you something, take for example Never Alone: a game that teaches you about the history of the Iñupiat people. I would argue that Aurion accomplishes this more so than any other game I’ve played by incorporating the culture and history into the gameplay itself whereas Never Alone simply showed you cutscenes.\n\nThe game begins with the player as Enzo, a young king on his wedding day. The nuptials are interrupted when his brother-in-law invades the village and exiles Enzo and his wife Erine from Zama. Now, the game sets up a compelling story and interesting characters but is guilty of an egregious error especially early on: info dump. During the first hour or so you get so many people, places and terms thrown at you that it’s hard to keep track. I’m all for world-building but it definitely could have been done with a more delicate touch instead bludgeoning the player with exposition. This also causes pacing issues and brings game to screech to a halt at times when an NPC is explaining a legend or practice. Yes, I want to know more about a culture but giving me a slideshow and going into great minutia about it is not the most elegant way to go about it. The dev team seemed to be more concerned with telling their culture’s history instead of telling a well-paced story, not that there is anything wrong with that. It’s admirable to be prideful about your history but I do find that it comes at the expense of a good story.\n\nThe gameplay is where this title really shines. When exploring the world you have full control over the character and even have some platforming elements involved. Enemies show up on the screen and battle is initiated when they are touched. This brings up the battle interface which is reminiscent of a 2D beat ‘em up. I was honestly shocked by how deep the combat system is, you have two basic attacks as well as “Aurions” which are different fighting styles. You can have four different Aurions available at a time and switch between each seamlessly. This can lead to some deep and rewarding combat that manages to always stay fresh. Add to the fact that there is some verticality to some fights with added platforms and Aurion is more than a competent fighter wrapped in an RPG. Speaking of, all your standard RPG elements are present: leveling up, skills, items to refill HP, and equipment. My one gripe about the RPG elements is that changing equipment does not change the character visually which is a bit disappointing. Got that fancy new sword? You’re still going to see the default sword. It’s not a deal breaker by any means but still bummed me out to see.\n\nVisually, the game looks great. The developers picked a strong artistic direction reminiscent of anime and perhaps intentionally (or not) the animated show The Boondocks. I would definitely say that Enzo and Erine are animated the best and some of the NPC’s can look a little off. Speaking of off, my one request to devs would be to change Enzo’s running. I though it looked terrible and award, like he was about to fall forward onto his face. Aside from the running complaint the visuals look great and have some really nice backdrops.\n\nAs far as freshmen efforts go, I think Kiro’o Games should be exceptionally proud of themselves. They have made a game that is not only unquestionably unique but deep and rewarding as well. It’s not without its faults if they can be looked past, there’s a good time to be had here. I should also note that I did not finish the game, I only got about a quarter of the way through so there is easily 20 hours of content here. Here’s hoping that Kiro’o can build upon what they have learned from Aurion. This is definitely a studio to keep your eye on going forward.","April 28","true","10.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/recommended/368080/","gamerlen","GamerLEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/","325 products in account","So, today (April 16th) the revised English dialogue patch came out for Aurion and I just finished playing through the tutorial. There's still a few mistakes here and there, but it's already a massive improvement over what they started with.\n\nNow that I've been able to understand what the heck the NPCs are saying I'm honestly intrigued by how Auronic warriors do battle, the concept of Aurionic energy, and so on and, yes, I want to keep playing. They still need to work a bit more on the English side of things, but then this is the studio's first game and mistakes are going to be made. The best thing they can do is learn from this and remember their mistakes when/if they make Aurion 2, or any other games in the future. Big lesson from this one: Make sure the script is ready for prime time in ALL the languages it's getting released in, then release the game.\n\nNow that I've been able to sink my teeth in combat is fast paced and fun, using Auronic powers is flashy and very exciting, and I'm definitely liking how Enzo's ultimate technique is basically 'make a giant glowing lion head appear and rawr my enemies to death'.\n\nSo yes, now that they've fixed the dialogue issues I can flip that big red thumb back around into a nice cool blue Thumbs Up for Aurion. Just keep up with the dialouge fixes and patching in the future and I think you've got a real winner for your first game.\n\nhttp://lenwolfgamer.tumblr.com/post/143044814142/aurion-legacy-of-the-kori-odan\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nDammit.\n\nI spent all week hyped up about this game. Its a fantasy RPG that ISN'T set in Middle Ages Europe, its dripping with African lore (I'm a massive loregeek and mythology geek so that already had me interested), and it promised action combat... but...\n\nDammit Dammit Dammit...\n\nThe dialogue is what did it for me, rather the translation of it. From what I understand, the game's script was originally in French... and I think they got the English version by running the script through Google translate. It comes off as very wooden and doesn't scan well. When the characters talk to each other its like someone trying to speak a language when they don't really know how. There's a lot of really awkward bits of dialogue early on and even a bunch of grammatical errors. Maybe not as big a deal for some, but those thing stand out like neon lights to me.\n\nReally, I just can't recommend it. I wanted to. Oh man I was going on to everyone who'd listen at work about how excited I was to come home and get this game! I wanted to play a fantasy RPG that wasn't about knights and wizards (or anime schoolchildren I guess) and... well, this isn't what I thought it would be at all.\n\nThe story could be amazing, but if it's poorly translated it won't matter. I'd imagine the French version of the story is much better but, well, I can't speak or read French! If you can, go for it. If you can't... maybe skip this one until they can hire someone to re-translate the dialogue.\n\nOh well... at least I'll have Indivisible to look forward to... in about two years.\n\nCLARIFICATION: When I say the dialogue is bad, I mean how it is WRITTEN. I'm not talking about voice acting here guys. In-game text-based dialogue with word bubbles. The translation from French to English is very poor and is very awkward to read at best.\n\nUPDATE: The devs reached out to me (see comments below) and said that they are going to patch the English dialogue next week. I did have a refund request in, but when they said the english dialouge is getting patched I decided to cancel it until after the patch comes through. We'll see if it fixes it or not.","April 14","true","6.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","43"

If you'd like to read our full review for the game, you can find it here: https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/aurion-legacy-of-the-kori-odan-overview-and-review/\n\nAurion is a JRPG inspired action roleplaying game that feels like a mixture of the early Tales games, Street Fighter and a beat 'em up game. The game's combat system has quite a bit to manage and it takes some skill to master everything completely. If you have trouble multitasking then you might have a little trouble getting used to the game's combat but once you do it's a lot of fun.\n\nThe game puts you in control of the king of Zama, Enzo Kori-Odan and his wife Erine Evou on a journey of enlightenment and learning after they were exiled by Erine's brother in law in a coup. They meet a wide range of different characters in their journey and the story goes in-depth with the mythology and culture that the game is based on. It explains in detail many different things such as the creation myths and how the Aurion's came to be. It covers a lot of really interesting things and if you enjoy mythology and learning about other cultures as much as mysef, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.\n\nI gave the game our Unmissable award in our full review and I'll be giving the game our recommended award here on Steam. It's a fantastic game and I've been having a great deal of fun with the game so far and I'm excited about seeing how it ends.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read our summary and full review folks!\n\n-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!\n\nOur Gameplay Video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sKbg0EAN8k","April 24","true","10.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

You could oversimply it by saying it's like a cross between Namco's Tales series and retro beat-em-ups, but like all good and worthwhile games, it's greater than the sum of those parts. Sadly, it is rough around the edges, though to be fair, it's in a way you might expect from a handful of developers first setting out to follow their dreams. There are glitches, but the most aggravating ones involve the game not alt-tabbing well, and that can be mitigated by pausing before switching to another window on your desktop. In other words, there's nothing game-breaking, so if you can make it through a game like the original release of Psychonauts, you should make it to the end loving this game too.","April 15","true","6.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","4"
