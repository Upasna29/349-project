It's up to you, his daughter, to restore the kingdom to its former glory!\n\nLike for 12 Labours of Hercules, the main character isn't helping at all. In other words, it's the servants that are doing all the work. Gnomes Garden is a casual time management game where you have workers that are gathering resources needed (food, wood, stone and crystals), building mines (for the stone and crystals), farms and windmills (for the food), workshop (for the wood), upgrading these for a better production and  repairing routes and other objectives (like light a fire or activate portals). However, the servants can be helped by witches (needed for some objectives) and firemen (helping objective plants to grow or to scare the little monster that will incapacitate your witch or servant from doing their jobs for a few seconds). And you'll repeat that  for 50 levels.\n\nHowever, there are temporary bonus, regenerating over time, that can be activated : run faster (your minions move faster), work faster (less time for the building to give the resources) and stop time (the timer is frozen for a limited time). And these are very handy if you want to reach the three stars. Indeed, you have a timer. If you go past a star, you're loosing it. The less time you spent, the more likely you'll keep three stars. And as it's an achievement, you're also motivated. Nothing is wrong to loose one or two in the first run, so that you can try different strategies for the level. However, keep in mind that sometimes, you need to manage tightly your resources: you may be lacking some of them when they're needed and can't advance anymore (example: no more stones for a hole in the road - the building that could have given you the resource is behind this hole and there is no other road to it - you're doomed to restart). One of the good points is that you're not limited in the tasks done by the servant, if you want to gather 3 woods and 2 foods, you can check them without restriction (compared to 12 Labours of Hercules where you couldn't indicate more than 3 tasks).\n\nAs you can see, the gameplay isn't hard per se, it's just a matter of being efficient and to make the right choices (no need to upgrade a building to the maximum if the current level is sufficient or to upgrade the house - I've made the majority of the levels with two workers only). However, you don't have any other characters that can help. It's just the minions, not even the princess is present in the level to do something.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad in itself, they're cute, however, the HUD could have been more reflecting this and the list of objectives less confusing. The soundtrack was also good.\n\nHowever, Gnomes Garden, while being still enjoyable, didn't have the same magic than 12 Labours of Hercules. You have more stuff to manage, true, but you can't choose your difficulty, the map is poorly designed and there, you don't have really any help from an heroin, contrary to Hercules and Megara, that were present and needed for some tasks. For the price, 12 Labours of Hercules proposes more fun for less money spent. But Gnomes Garden is still a good little game. Wait for a discount or for a bundle.","April 28","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Hard to get completely stuck, but sometimes challenging to get three stars. I missed getting three stars on about a third of the levels the first time around, and liked the game enough to want to go back and replay them.\n\nMajor downsides:\n\nThe sides are cut off in fullscreen mode on a 4:3 monitor, occasionally cutting off things you need to click on. It mostly works in windowed mode, but the resources needed tooltips are sometimes cut off, so you have to guess what you need, and the window's too small to play comfortably. (Or maybe I just need new glasses.)\n\nA bug with the same achievement popping up every five seconds when I replayed levels after completing the game. Irritating enough to make the game unplayable unless I turn off the sound.\n\nClickable areas aren't well defined and are sometimes misaligned, so when objects are close together, it can be difficult to click on the right thing.\n\nI had enough fun with the game to recommend it despite these issues, but they might be dealbreakers for someone else.","January 27","true","10.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Would rather spend around 2.50$ for this game. But nevertheless, it's an OK game if you're bored and just want to click away :-)","December 20, 2015","true","7.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Later levels do ramp up the difficulty slightly by requiring optimal play to earn all three stars on a level.  Even with that added pressure the decision making for the player is minimal at best.","March 29","false","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's so simple yet fantastic, I can see potential expansions or sequels for it happening. The concept is very simple. Overall I found all but two levels to be fairly easy, however great way to pass some time. Hope they make more levels or another game with even more to do. By far one of my new favorite casual games.","December 30, 2015","true","19.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"
