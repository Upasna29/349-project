This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Six Sides of the World is an original 3D puzzle game with bright, vibrant graphics and a gentle introduction leading to progressively more difficult puzzles.\n\nI'm not sure if there's actually a plot to the game or if it's more just puzzling for puzzling's sake, but it seems that you're in control of a space ship that looks (and sounds) a little like a fish, moving through level after level of cube-shaped planets around the galaxy, beginning at Tau Ceti.\n\nEach cube-planet has you collecting a crystal and finding the exit wormhole, usually moving through a number of teleporters to different sides of the planet, flicking switches to open up new paths along the way.\n\nPuzzling is relatively standard fare, but the difficulty curve is very well managed and the game is challenging enough to keep you interested, while starting out easy enough to draw you in. There's no time pressure (apart from timed switches), which is great for a game of this type, and the implemented Steam achievements give you a little more motivation to complete each level. You'll collect most of the achievements by completing the game in its entirety (which I haven't managed to do).\n\nSix Sides of the World is easy to get into, but extremely hard to complete.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Six Sides' graphics are bright, clean, and colorful, and do the job well. They're not going to win any Nvidia awards, but they're attractive enough. The tutorial graphics in particular are well done, with cartoon-like projection screens subtly popping up on occasional levels in the early game to show a new action or task and how to complete it. The player's ship is cute, but I do wonder why it looks like a fish! (Maybe it's just me?)\n\nYou can rotate each level to get a better idea of the puzzles ahead and an overview of how to beat the level, but I can't help but think that being able to zoom in and out with the mouse wheel might have been a welcome addition as well.\n\nSound - Sound effects do the job without standing out. The music is pleasant enough: electronic and thematic, slightly reminiscent of The Orb or similar electronica. I like it, but with most levels having the same music restarting at the beginning each time, it does start to get a little repetetive.\n\nGameplay - Your ship is controlled with the mouse: left button moves to a new square on the current side of the cube planet you're playing, and left mouse and drag rotates the world, rotating the camera for a different view. Controls are simple, but the levels become fiendishly difficult quickly. Colored teleports, switches, one-way switches, timed switches, laser turrets, multiple planets per level ... all will thwart your attempts at a quick path to the next level.\n\nEach level is a discrete entity, giving you a sense of accomplishment once you complete it, and allowing for gaming in bite-sized chunks (as a casual game should), although bear in mind that levels can have multiple exits; different wormholes lead to different destinations, so you'll have to complete some levels multiple times.\n\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Pretty graphics and ear-soothing music.\n+ Easy mouse controls\n+ Addictive gameplay and Steam achievements to keep you coming back for more.\n+ Trading cards\n+ Stable: no crashing, alt-tab works, doesn't use 100% CPU while minimized. It's coded well!\n\nCons:\n- Some levels have to be completed multiple times to progress to different destinations, so it can be a bit repetetive.\n- Some levels require multiple attempts, just to learn what certain switches are going to do. For the more complicated levels, this can waste a significant amount of time on retries.\n- May cause rage quit. :)\n\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Six Sides of the World is a well-made casual puzzle game, with friendly graphics and music, levels aplenty, trading cards, Steam achievements, and enough puzzles to keep you coming back for days on end. Pick it up if it sounds like your sort of game; you won't be disappointed.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 22","true","2.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

As things go it's about as formulaic as things get. Following the trend of a large number of puzzle games over the last few years it focuses on one main mechanic, in this case moving between the faces of cubes, and builds up from there. However just because it's come for a tried and tested mould doesn't mean that it's dull, not in the slightest.\n\nYou start as a cute little submarine type robot on a cube shaped planet. If there is a story I managed to miss it completely but I imagine it wouldn't add much. Your goal is simple, collect the blue crystal which will open the blue portal and then get to the blue portal. From there you are introduced to portals, step into one green portal and you'll come out at the other green portal. Blue portal to blue, red to red and so on.\n\nIt's not long until the difficulty starts to ramp up. Soon you need to juggle switches, buttons that turn off after certain amount of time, deadly lasers, deadly water, gates that need to be activated in the correct order, pipes etc etc. Suffice to say it gets fairly complicated fairly fast. By the end of the third level (not even halfway through the games 50 or so levels) each puzzle was really testing me and completing each one felt like an achievement.\n\nFor the aesthetic of the game there's not much to say. The music and art style are nice, they compliment the theme of the game and make it more interesting but they're just kind of there. Not particularly standout.\n\nMy overall impression of this game is that it's well... generic. And I think that's not as much of a condemning of this game as much as it is something of showing what the current games market is like. As Daniel West said in his now famous Gamasutra article maybe "'Good' isn't good enough" in the current indie scene. Six Sides of the World doesn't break any new boundaries or push the limits of gaming. But it is a very solid, fun and somewhat tricky puzzle game. Whilst it might not have widespread appeal if you're a fan of solving difficult puzzles that really need you to plan ahead and think then Six Sides of the World is an easy sell.\n","January 21","true","2.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/384480/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live life on a planet that was in the shape of a cube rather than the Earth’s globe? Well you’re not quite going to get that with Cybernetik Design’s debut Steam title, Six Sides of the World, but what you will get is a rock solid adventure-puzzle game that fits those dimensions.  Cybernetik Design is yet another one man studio with that developer being Emilio José L. Joyera, from Barcelona, Spain. Joyera also works for Abylight another indie game studio who have made games for Nintendo consoles and hand held consoles, Java and iOS. Josara has previously designed games for The Games Kitchen. However, he also has passion for other projects and thus Cybernetik Design was born as an avenue for him to create his own games.\n\nI believe that in Six Sides of the World that Joyera has gotten a lot right on debut. I truly appreciate that he took advantage of the Steam Achievement and Steam Trading Card features. It demonstrates that he is aware of some of the more extrinsic things that Steam users like to have in their games. But having those things is never enough. It’s what is under the hood that counts most. By that we’re talking game concept, playability, presentation, etc. In this case I believe that there is much to like here.\n\nThe concept of the game is that you must guide Maigo throughout each level to gain the key (or what I would consider to be keys) while traversing colored portals that will transport you around the cube and enemies who will attempt to gun you down. When traversing throughout the game with the portals you will have to keep in mind that many of them are positioned in order to stump you. Will you pick the right path or will you allow the cheeky design of the transformers keep you running in circles or worse, lead you to your demise? The gameplay mechanics have been very well designed. It starts off easy enough as you learn the basics but before you know it you will be riddled, stumped and mystified. For those who succeed achievements can come quickly and feel rewarding and levels can be over quickly. However, for those who struggle between levels you’ll find yourselves spending upwards of several minutes on the levels you find challenging. The graphics more than suffice as they are everything you would need to immerse yourself into the game without being irritating. It’s not award winning but then again they absolutely don’t have to be. The sound is cute and charming but has a tendency of becoming repetitive. The overall presentation has been well executed. There isn’t much to criticize here.\n\nSix Sides of the World is a well executed and clever little puzzle game that is an absolutely delightful way of spending several hours. If you’re a puzzle fan then this is a recently released game that you should be purchasing.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 30","true","49.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

That's not a bad thing by itself but the way the difficulty increases is just to throw more things at you rather than require clever and interesting solutions.\n\nThe worst thing though is how you might not discover the solution to solving a puzzle until you've already failed it.  So a lot of trial and error and a lot of backtracking.  Overall it's just a lot of wasted time and it often feels more like work than fun.  Above average graphics though.","January 25","false","1.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Great atmosphere and music too.  In the end though by breaking the puzzle up into cubes it just makes the game harder to play without any real benefit.  It might as well all be on a flat surface when you get right down to it.  The fact that its cubes just makes it so you cant see what you need to see all at once.  Still a good puzzle game but would be better fit on mobile for cheap with or without 3d.","January 20","false","3.1"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","5","23","0","0"
