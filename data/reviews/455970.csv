You just stat grind till you can make enough money to buy the stat boosting potions. Once you do that build your hp and damage a bit. Talk to Chloe a few times to progress the story. Then you will face the "Underworld Knight". Body the Knight save the queen.  After you save the queen you wait a few days for her to recover. After that I don't think there is anymore I'm on like day 105 and nothing else seems to happen. It seems a like pretty troll game. I don't plan on going any further. If anyone wants to and finds more too it let me know but I pretty much felt like it was kind of a waste of time. Cool consept if you actually push the story maybe. Either way it really feels like a troll game.","March 26","false","2.3"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","40","51","2","0"

Mostly you just click 2 schools per day that'll teach you stuff (most of the stastics you train being useless and non-existant), each time having to go through 3 dialogues of learning the same stuff (nope, they couldn't just combine the 3 rolls and safe you all this pain) and... that's about it.\nYou can buy boosters to use in combat that'll never appear in combat, most stats are completely useless so you just have to stick to the schools that aren't, and then you can use all that to... fight 1 single enemy. Literally, that's all there is to this game.","April 26","false","4.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Then you click on 3 icons to do chores build stats then go to town to solve a lateral thinking puzzle.\n\nThats as far as I got some stuff happened while progressing through the story.\n\nThe part I do enjoy about the game are the lateral thinking puzzles.\n\nTo the dev:\nI think if you just revamped the game to focus on these lateral thinking puzzles change the video to advertise THAT you may be more successful.\n\nTo those that are interested in buying this game:\nI think most of you should pass. It's definitely a niche game designed for masochists.\n\nI would most likely play it again if there is an update with more puzzles or story.\n\n","March 26","true","1.8"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","13","25","4","0"

After you figure it out it's really just a huge grind, which isn't fun. The story, or some aspect later in the game may be redeeming, but I'm going to force myself to get to that part because right now it is simply no fun to play.","April 24","false","4.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It's like a discount "Long Live the Queen". It's not terrible, but it is a time waster. You will probably die a lot. No Save feature, no keeping your stats when you die and best of all, no clue what to really do. Just Prey your HP up, get that defense raised and go to business school because you will die, and it will all be your fault for not preparing.\n\nHow do you prepare? Don't ask me, I died first monster after 1 hour of play!","March 25","true","1.0"," 10 of 41 people (24%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","24","10","41","10","1"
