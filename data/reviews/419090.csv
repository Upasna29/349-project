This game is pretty good, if you can get it for cheap like I did.\n\nThis is another late 1980's style vertical scrolling action-arcade style of game. Some call these kind of games "schmupps" or something like that. Lots of enemies fly at you from the top of the screen and into the firepower of your ship which is usually located near the bottom of the screen pointing ever upwards. This game is pretty good but extremely difficult, making making it almost as frustrating as it is fun.\n\n\n+Good graphics. The graphics in this game are fairly dark though and look oddly greasy and shiny making for a fairly interesting and unique style. It is rainy in a couple of the stages but another stage is a desert and it still looks oddly greasy but this game still looks pretty good.\n\n+The controls are tight and responsive.\n\n+The enemies and stages are fairly inventive.\n\n+There are 3 ships to choose from and 2 more which might be able to be unlocked in time (but one of those unlockable ships requires you to be really, really great at this very difficult game as you would have to complete the game without using a single 'continue').\n\n+/- The music tends more towards the alternative or heavy metal style rather than the frenetic techno musical style which most of these kind of games have. The music is somewhat catchy but the overall quality of both the sound and music is somewhat muddy.\n\n+/-The game's menu can take some getting used to and is best navigated by mouse though the gameplay itself should be played with a keyboard (I don't use a videogame controller so I don't know how well that works).\n\n-This is a short game. There are only 5 stages.\n\n-This is an extremely difficult and unforgiving game which could cause some major frustration, particularly if you try to complete the nearly impossible and attempt to unlock all of this game's playable ships. The speed of the enemy projectiles is extremely fast and they are numerous. The bosses are almost impossible to defeat without being destroyed multiple times. If you are looking for a simple little action game which will provide a severe challenge, this game should do it for you, at least for a while.\n\n-The title of this game sounds like it might have something or other to do with viruses or disease but I can assure you that this game has absolutely NOTHING to do with vectors (other than the angles at which enemies approach and fire at you) and strains (other than the strain of trying to play it without getting your little ship blown to smithereens). This game appears to provide you with no backstory whatsoever.","May 1","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics are incredible, it's super fun to play and it gets really crazy and hectic on the harder difficulties. There's a good amount of ships to choose from, each with their own cool power ups and abilities. There's a good variety of enemies and the boss fights are epic. I definitely recommend this to shmup fans or anyone looking for some quick fun action.","December 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The power ups were great, visually and the amount of damage I could deal as I collected more and more, blasting through dozens of enemies like it was nothing at all, yes yes, it smells like a proper shoot em up, indeed it does!","December 17, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Even on easy its a challenge for a casual gamer. I do like how you have shields, but requires you to push button B. But I wish when a enemy is destroyed its bullets would disappear. So much dodging! This a much better shmup than many other shmups for more money on STEAM, its a very good game for a very good price. I'd give it an 8/10. Boss fights are pretty darn original and fun.","February 5","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I cant believe only two people made this game!\n\n+EXCELLENT progression system. This is probably the best feature. More shmups should do the same.\n+I really enjoy how all the HUD info is in the side bars instead of the top like a typical vertical shooter. Great idea and again- i wish more shmups would do the same.\n+Powerups in levels just like Strikers 1945.\n+Nice difficulty. I'm not a huge fan of the super intense bullet hell shooters, (although i will play them on normal or easy). However this game fits in just right with being able to see where i am and actually have a second to *think* about what to do next instead of having millions of bullets and 1/10th of an inch to budge through them.\n+Incentive to play better by unlocking stars at the end of levels, which unlock better ships with different/stronger shooting patterns to help out on higher difficulties.\n+Good bullet/enemy patterns and fun bosses.\n+Achievement list is well thought out and fun to go through- but not being too extreme.\n\n-Unity engine makes navigating around menus with a controller annoying. (Doable, but still annoying).\n-Biggest complaint-->Music is absolutely dreadful. Slow and drab with a TON of cymbal crashes.\n-Voiceovers when you get a power-up or a bomb gets old quick. Glad it can be turned off though.\n\nI really hope there is a sequel to this game. It's a great shmup that deserves some recognition and cashflow for the devs.\n\nI haven't played this game before all the updates came out so i cant comment on that.","May 30","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are parts of the game that could benefit from audio. such as charged laser attacks from enemies. The music is a preference thing but it was dull and repetative though slighly moody.\n\nBullet patterns are generic and uninspiring but there are some good level boss ideas that need more fleshing out.\n\nsome transition scenes when moving in 3d space have bullets awkwardly follow when they should probably desapear.\nin the same transitions i was moving through the background objects.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential but needs a lot of polish.","February 17","false","0.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
