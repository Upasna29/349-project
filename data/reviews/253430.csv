"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualVictory/recommended/253430/","VirtualVictory","VirtualVictory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualVictory/","83 products in account","First, allow me to tell you that I'm only going to be rating this product on solely what it is, I will not be comparing it to other products. Content in this review is subject to change when the product gets modified. If you would like to contact the developers with your opinions about this product or suggest future updates, contact them at support@digitaldnagames.com.\n\nSince its launch on Steam in February 2014 this game has been criticized for having a multitude of issues ranging from having absolutely no graphic or control settings to no communication options. Recently, this product has implemented the following:\n\n● Resolution settings. You can now change the resolution in-game!\n● Render distance settings. Lowest, Low, Medium, High, and Ultra.\n● Texture quality settings. Low, Medium and High.\n\nThese settings were needed in order to call this a PC game. Now that these issues have been addressed, allow me to criticize some of the things they have recently implemented and the things they still haven't. They recently implemented a fairly large health bar at the top of the screen. I find this rather odd considering health in Castle Miner Z almost immediately regenerates. I would prefer if I could move this around or just turn it off all together. Along with a nice retexture of every block in the game, they've also added a new blue user interface.\n\nThe game still lacks a variety of enemies, blocks, an antialiasing setting and a voice chat system. Also, text communication is rather limited. For example, if I wanted to say "Hello everyone, how are you all doing?" I would only have 5 characters left afterward. You also do not have the ability to paste characters.\n\n\nFebruary 2014:\nCastle Miner Z's Controls Initial Release[i.imgur.com]\nCastle Miner Z's Graphic settings Initial Release[i.imgur.com]\n\nMarch 2014:\nCastle Miner Z's Controls in March 2014[i.imgur.com]\nCastle Miner Z's Graphic settings in March 2014[i.imgur.com]\n\nMay 2014:\nCastle Miner Z's Controls in May 2014[i.imgur.com]\nCastle Miner Z's Graphic settings in May 2014[i.imgur.com]\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are still some major issues plaguing Castle Miner Z, I've listed a few below.\n\n● Save Data Deletion Upon Every Update. This is serious, what's the point in playing in the first place if everything you accomplish is refreshed after every major update?\n\n● Lack of Voice Chat Functionality. Currently the only means of communication in-game is a very limited text system.\n\n● Lack of NPC Variety. Understandably not every game has to have 30+ different models of enemies but different reskins of dragons, zombies, skeletons and Demons with the same exact sound effects just aren't enough.\n\n● Lack of Block Variety. A larger variety of things to craft with resources would have been great additions. Dirt, rock, wood, ore, Bloodstone, weapons, explosives, doors, and walls is what I would expect from an Alpha.\n\n\nMany of you commenting think I am hypocritical by spending over 300 hours in this game, I find this rather absurd. If anything, you should consider the time I spent on this game as thorough testing of the product. For those of you wondering, 2/3 of the time I spent playing this game went towards an achievement that requires you run the game consecutively for 100 hours. The first time I attempted this achievement the memory leakage was so horrid it immbolized my PC after the first three days. I tried it once again in windowed mode and succeeded.","February 3, 2014","false","307.5"," 2,557 of 3,094 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","557","3","6","135"

CastleMiner Z is a Voxel FPS Horror game where your only goal seems to survive or go farther from your starting point, and go progress to get higher tiers to fight the zombies with.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics; They are very poor and need work, and a lot of times glitch out.\n\nSecondly there's the Gameplay: The gameplay is decent, but get's very repetitive, with nothing much to do other than go farther away from spawn and try not to die. The guns are very unabalanced and need work aswell. For a survival game, suprisingly you don't have to eat or anything, you can literally just sit in a hole in a mountain or something and not get killed ever, and once you're aware of that it becomes very stale.\n\nThird of all, Optimization: This game isn't optimized very well, and has laggy FPS even on good computers. The porting from Xbox 360 to PC/Steam is poor aswell and feels like they put no effort into it. Even the Xbox 360 controller buttons are still there. It's missing basic features like a ingame chat that should be there already.\n\nLastly, the bugs. This game has a lot of bugs, like.. a lot of bugs. How could a game be released like this? Sonic 06 all over again.  This game is okay, but needs imporvement, I wouldn't recommend it right now.\n\nI'd recommend making this a early access game if possible, it has potential, but it feels like your not using it.

It's fun, but there's not much here. The only things that you can craft are basic building blocks from wood gathered, tools (just like the ones in Minecraft), and an assortment of guns. It's too simple! There's no need to make a crafting table in order to make better weapons, there's no form of armor, and there's no need to build a furnace to smelt the ore that you've collected during your mining adventures. I can't stress this enough. It's too simple!\n\nSecondly, the game is really hard, despite it's simplicity. Even playing on Easy mode, the zombies would kill me in just 3 hits, which is ridiculous. To make matters worse, when you die, all of the items in your inventory are gone. Poof, vanished into thin air, so even if you manage to get back to where you were killed, you can't collect any of your stuff that you had worked so hard for. Oh, and did I mention that the zombies spawn almost right next to you? Yeah, random spawn points for ALL of the enemies, based entirely on where you are. In other words, you are the spawn point for enemies. It's really unfair, especially when they take an entire clip to kill, can run at you faster than you can run yourself, and can kill you in 3 F#$KING HITS EVEN ON EASY MODE! Oh yeah, and a Dragon will come by and F#$k your s#$t up royally every couple of days...\n\nWhich brings me to my next issue. The day/night cycle on this game is absurd. Days only last a few minutes at best, and the night lasts forever! I got into the game, was looking through the UI for the crafting and by the time I had understood how everything worked, it was night time and I was getting my face ripped off by a zombie. It's ludicrous how short the days are and how long the nights are. SERIOUSLY needs to be reworked.\n\nLastly, and this is just a nitpicky thing, the sensitivity is really high, and even when you adjust it, it doesn't change anything. When you're in standard view, if you twitch in any direction, you'll practicially do a 180, but when you aim down the sight, you're lucky to get the damn thing to move. It's very unpolished. Honestly, I'd stick to Minecraft if you're looking for a sandbox crafting type game, it has way more to do, the enemies are balanced and won't continually spawn right next to you, and if you die, you can at least get your stuff back (if you manage to get back to the spot where you died fast enough)","October 23, 2014","false","2.5"," 503 of 653 people (77%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","77","503","653","23","9"

Seems to me like they're trying to make a quick buck and it makes me sick.\n\nEdit:\nAs of tonight (1.5 days after emailing steam support) I have yet to receive a response....\nSteam has lost me as a customer unless or until I am able to get this resolved.\n\nFirst I'd like to say that I purchased this game on the xbox and actually really enjoyed it but it is lacking major technical features for a full steam release title on the pc. Steam should have labeled this release as an early access title!\n\nDigitalDNA Games, for you I have just spent 30 minutes troubleshooting your game, these are my results which are the same issues I was running into yesterday. Also I tested it on two known good systems both yesterday and today and I have a reasonably good internet connection: ping 25ms, DL 165 mbps, UL 8 mbps.\n\nOn both systems I occasionally experience an error where after selecting "Play online" I am presented with the message "connecting... please wait..." but the message just continues to flash and never disappears. I have waited as long as 5 minutes to no avail.\n\nI seem to run into this error about 1/5 times.\n\nWhen I am able to access the list of player servers I am having slightly better luck today, but still about 1/2-3/4 of the times I try to connect to one I am presented with an ambiguous error message of no use to me in troubleshooting whatever problem may exist. The text of this error is as follows:\n\n"Connection Error\n\nConnection failed: Host Disconnected\n\nOk"\n\nAlso if I accidently try to join a server that requires a password, the cancel button on the dialogue box allowing you to enter a password does not work. When I click it nothing happens at all. I have to select ok which takes me to the same ambiguous error message as above and then to the main menu.\n\nNow that I have gone out of my way to reinstall your game and spent about 45 minutes to an hour of my time troubleshooting for you, I would ask that you contact me directly or through steam and offer me a refund on the $8.49 that I spent yesterday on your hastily released title.\n\n\n2nd edit: The steam support ticked I opened that has yet to receive a response is ticket #5897-WEYV-9696.","February 3, 2014","false","0.5"," 931 of 1,294 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","931","1","0","56"

Minecraft was all the rage at the time, so when I discovered this gem, I thought it would be a fun alternative to minecraft. The graphics were more unique and different from minecrafts, zombies and dragons to fend off (Not to mention the aliens that would be released later on), and it had GUNS. An alternative to minecraft... with guns! The map for this game was very unique, as you travel further north east south or west, you experience forests, floating islands, deserts, mountains, and much more. Not to mention a Hell world with endless amounts of zombies and devils. You can travel the map or set up a homebase or both, so this game really is adventurous! I mean sure, the graphics arent top notch, but what would you expect from a cheap indie game? The graphics really dont hurt the gameplay, unless youre running on Windows 95 or 98.

The further you go out into the world the more zombies spawn and if you and all your allies fall, you are stripped of your inventory (Not your hotbar) and are sent back to the start. The best way to explain it is Temple Run meets Minecraft, which is pretty interesting, but unfortinutley like all the other mechanics in this game are pretty half baked and or not inplemented at all, but more on that later, and if I COULD play Dragon Endurance it currently sounds quite nice.\n\n+  The graphics  are pretty nice as of 1.7 as they have retextured every block and monster in the game, making it more like a fresh game than a dull uninspired clone which is what it looked of before. (And the sky looks fantastic at night)\n\n+  The music is actually nice . Yes, it does come out of nowhere but it does sound nice. (My personal favorite is the song that plays when you enter the desert!)\n\n+  A nice variety of weapons  from shotguns to lazer swords!\n\n+  The ambiance in caves is really creepy  and nice. Yes, the sounds are pretty lacking (check the cons section) but whenever I first walked into a cave and heard the dripping of water I felt like I was not welcome. Then, I heard the rattling of the skeletons and I was scared stiff!\n\n+  Game CAN be fun at times. Playing this game every once in a while is actually a fun time, sure after a while the difficulty really hurts me wanting to progress but it is fun either way! I even trying to livestream it every once in a while, and everytime my friend comes over this is a game we play!\n\nCONS: (I really hate to do this but the time has come)\n\n+  Extremley unbalanced and near impossible. What I mean by this is one zombie (which mind you dozens of them spawn) can knock you down to under half health and they are relentless with attacks, which would be cool BUT once you are near them or their body collides with your, you slow down to a crawl and you have no choice but to look around to see it hit you once and once more spawning you back and the beginning and the hours upon hours of grinding lost. Weapons are not explained well and sometimes a weapons shoots further or has better accurancy than what it should be (IE: A pistol has better aim than a RIFLE!) And while on the topic of accuracy, aiming on sights does absolutley nothing, the only thing it does is move your model to the crosshair and even then the bullets still go wherever the hell they want. Finally, once you walk not even 100 blocks from the tower at spawn a dragon will spawn, this is a HUGE problem as most players want to explore a bit more and grasp game concepts before a freaking boss is thrown at them.\n\n+  Animations are broken beyond belief:  Player animations are glitching with clipping polygons (or whatever they are) and zombies just slide along the ground when they fail to catch a player only for them to despawn for no apparent reason. Players look slightly to the left than what the model shows and aiming on sights doesn't even have a model change on Multiplayer.\n\n+ Multiplayer syncing is BROKEN: Sometimes mobs spawn and other players wont see them, but they are there client side and thus causes confusion between players and causes a waste of ammo from other players and being attacked and killed in 2 hits by an invisible mob is not fun, especially in a very lengthy non saving campaign like this. (If you are going to make a comment complaining somehow then use the word Bannana in it so I know you read the review)\n\n+  Mobs are completley broken and don't function logically: First off, no fall damage for the enemy so falling into the depths of hell is just a rash in the rear for our fellow enemies! Secondly, after not hitting a player for about 10 seconds the enemy stumbles around and just dissapears which helps to levelize the mobs in the game but it extremley wonky and doesn't feel right at all. The AI is VERY predictable, if a zombie jumps to you just move back a bit and you can catch him easily. Oh, and Skeletons can spawn in lit caves.\n\n+ VERY LITTLE VARIETY IN BLOCKS AND MOBS!  Only a mere 5 mobs exist in the game, and 3 of those 5 spawn in specific locations (Dragons are 1 per biome, Aliens are at space ships, and Demons are in hell only. And dragons should have more attacks with their different varieties. Blocks, HEH! In CastleMinerZ there are a mere 13 or so blocks in the game, making castle building tideous and boring and very very unsatifying.\n\n+  Survival has little to no point,  as the world generates in a set pattern, and what is the point of survival as most people say? "Find a nice place to settle and survive the night" well, it still uses the same generation as Endurance which causes you to be forced to stay in the first biome of the world.\n\n+  Endurance world generation is way too predictable,  If you made someone play Endurance twice a week apart and didnt tell them the world was randomly generated I'm pretty sure they wouldn't even notice as it always goes in the same order and with little variety in the biomes infact I can name them all here: (I also have some opinions on the current biome list)\n1. Plains\n2. Floating Islands\n3. Desert (More like a flat land, here and on Space Ships spawn)\n4. Mountains\n5. Snow\n6. Ore Lands (Just the above ground being gone and just caves exist pretty terrible)\n7. Hell (You can get to hell in the first 5 minutes by digging down 40-50 blocks which is TINY for a cave system to change into a whole new world)\n\n+  Mining is boring!  With a little over 4 ore types it sufferes even when the word "Miner" is in the name! It feels like a chore every time with and just makes me want to quit the game early just becuase there is no variety in the below.\n\n+  Sounds and Music Placement,  while admittedly the music is pretty nice, it comes out of nowhere and doesn't have a point, maybe if it played after you killed a dragon it'd be a nice reward. The sounds are TERRIBLE with very low quality sounds and some really obveous freesounds sounds (My friend pointed most of the royality free sounds (findsounds/freesounds) which is rediculous and just don't sound nice at all, with the constant wind blowing and the really terrible zombie sounds and the annoying clacking of the skeletons which could be scary but the poor audio direction along with the ♥♥♥♥ poor sound engine doesn't help at all.\n\nCONCLUSION: Overall CastleMinerZ is a poor Minecraft inspired game that has little variety a POOR difficulty curve spanning from easy to balls-to-the-wall-hard in 5 mintues and awful sound direction really hurt what could otherwise be a unique block game. Maybe soon they will fix everything, but at the time it is not recomended in the slightest.","January 17, 2015","false","10.7"," 209 of 297 people (70%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","70","209","297","21","41"

Each biom contains its own dragon which throws fireballs on you.

When this came out on Steam, Minecraft had already been out for some years, and has been heavily updated and can be heavily modded, while this game has a severe lack of content (which is a terrible flaw for this type of game), very minor updates and cannot be modded. On top of that, this game costed $0.99 on Xbox 360 before it was discontinued, so why the heck do I have to pay $4.99 for it now, especially considering this game is a sad PC port. Plus, the co-op mode has no in-game chat system whatsoever.\n\nMinecraft's Main Focus (in my opinion):\nMining and crafting is the main point, and once you become an unstoppable warlord or whatever with all the best swords, armor, enchantments, etc., there are countless things you can still do afterwards. (someone was actually able to make a fully functionable computer with a crap ton of redstone)\n\nCastleMinerZ's Main Focus (in my opinion):\nThis Minecraft clone has a heavy emphasis on survival, but there's like only 5 different enemies or something like that, and once you've got the best guns and a crap ton of ammo, you're done!

The enemies are different (and VASTLY more annoying), you can craft a whole slew of guns (from pistols to laser sniper rifles and alien AKs), and the game has a slightly more survival-based attitude to it.

The "combat" is somewhat clunky, though I've played worse. There's a smoke effect when objects are hit or struck by bullets that make it damn near impossible see what you're actually doing.The concept of scavenging by day and bracing yourself for attack by night are good ideas, but I'm pretty sure that's how Minecraft works (as I said earlier, I've never played the original). Also, zombies leap incredibly far and a single strike can take away a quarter health. If you can avoid being hit for about 3 seconds, you near instantly fully regenerate health.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a set goal or anything to work towards (likely Minecraft's objectives, as well), so that left me experimenting with some game mechanics, all I was able to figure out was to move, shoot zombies on sight, and smack things with a pickaxe, allowing me to reposition the cubes I demolished with said pickaxe.\n\nI wasn't expecting a AAA experience, but the little bit I've heard and the reviews I've read lead to an underwhelming experience on this game. Maybe I'm missing the best of the game, since I couldn't find a single server (not that I was really expecting a huge, dedicated playerbase). Single player might be good to run through it a couple times, but not much more. The game doesn't really make any sense and I don't suppose it's supposed to, but why zombies and dragons?\n\nThe best scenario I can imagine with this game is arming yourself to the teeth and trying to survive the night, but I haven't been able to figure out how to actually do this, as it's not worth spending the time in the game to gather the resources, craft the prerequisite items, gather more resources and craft the real items, to burn through everything in a matter of minutes.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, I would not recommend this game to anyone as better alternatives exist and the money can be spent on them, instead.

After 5 hours or so, I had the highest tier weaponry, and traveled out 10,000 + Blocks. That's only on singleplayer, which is one of this game's weak points. Playing 6+ more hours with my friend was enjoyable, but tedious, and at times, too easy. Enemies couldn't get close enough to our fort to damage it when we reached diamond-tier weapons. On the topic of weapons, there is no armor in this game, so you will be stuck with getting killed in 2-3 hits, if they get close enough to hit you.\nAlso, their are maybe 5 enemy types in the game: Zombie, Skeleton, Skeletal archer, A demon, and a dragon, each with different coloration of themselves. The Demon (Which me and my friend cleverly called Satan) Spawns in the underworld, and anywhere else randomly after entering hell. This wouldn't be a problem at all, if you could kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Normally (I.E by Wiki's standard) you should be able to kill him after obtaining bloodstone weaponry (cleverly, bloodstone is only found in hell.) However, there seemed to of been a glitch which bullets, and even lazer weaponry, would pass right through him. (And the undead dragon). This may have been only in our case, nontheless, unacceptable.\nA mentioned earlier, that enemies rarely got close enough to us to hurt us. To dabble on that more, guns after iron tier really are just too powerful. It takes maybe two bullets from an autorifle, which has a clip size of 30, to kill zombies and skeletons. And it takes just under a clip or two to kill a dragon.\n\nTo close up this rather long review, when this game goes on sale for 1 dollar (or regional amount) then this is worth the sudo 12 hours you get out of it, otherwise, avoid like the plague.","September 5, 2015","false","12.4"," 76 of 118 people (64%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","64","76","118","14","0"

Skeltons come out of the deep dark carverns to rip the flesh off my bones. If your lucky they won't sneak up behind you and claw you to death, instead they'll club you to death with their own bones.  Dragons spit molten balls of flaming stone like a machinegun at me, they land and explode all around me.  One minute into the game and it scares the crap out me, I died from a skeleton ripping the flesh off my bones.\n\nTwo minutes later I went underground and zombies are roaring and diging for me while skeletons are making hissing sounds all around. I hear dragons roaring in the sky even while underground the sound of fireballs landing muffeled only a little by the stone and dirt between me and the dragons.  I pile stone up all around me but they just keep coming for me.  I dig deeper but they're still coming at this point, I am crying and calling for my Mommy now.  :)  Diging even deeper I fell though the ground back into the main caveren, thankfully I could see the sun was back, I escaped to the surface.  Safe, until night comes again.\n\nThe End\n\nThe crafting system is very easy to understand, the invertory is neat and tidy to. The movement system is very fluid, also you don't have to manual jump there is an option for automatic jumping which is nice.  For a block game the graphics are very good and the sky is amazing.  The weather adds a very dark and creppy feel to the game.  The guns are very cool and look nice to.  Enemies are very frequent and challenging.\n\nOverall I totally recommend this game.","August 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 47 of 68 people (69%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","69","47","68","13","0"

The game has little to no optimization, no avatar customization, and not even the ability to map out your controls... and that sucks.\n\nThis is yet another "poor mans mincraft" that happened to stand out from the crowd of the slapped together junk of the Xbox live indie marketplace section. It has some interesting mechanics and some degree of difficulty to keep someone entertained for usually a few hours at a time. It is in no way a "work of art" or "masterpiece" but it doesn't mean it isn't a decent time waster.\n\nAside from the "Special Promotion" it got from launching, the game is $10... It's on the Xbox marketplace for $1.\n\nEdit: After playing this game for a bit, im going to have to change my stance on this. It's a game that in no means is worth more than its old $1 price tag.

I absolutely loved this game on console, and personally, I'd give this game almost a 8/10, WHICH is saying a lot because it's an indie game being compared to games of a higher budget and of better game designers.\n\n(Keep in mind that this game is being compared to others of it's kind and is completely based off of my tastes and my opinions. I also did this review when I was really tired and just got off of the game)\n\nI have played this game since it's days early on the Xbox 360 Indie Game. This game is well known on the Xbox as well for being the version of Minecraft that was even prefered when Minecraft Xbox 360 Version came out, because Xbox Minecraft was bad anyway. The game follows the same principles as Minecraft, like blocks that you mine and making Mineshafts to improve the tools that you currently have. However, this game is mainly made for survival rather than creativity. You also save your main inventory bar, even when you die, making it easy to just save items that are in your main bar. The game has 3 MAJOR game modes; Endurance (with a Dragon only endurance mode unlocked later), Creative (Which is pointless about calling it "Creative" because of the idea that there are no creative building materials), and Survival (Basically, endurance without the goal of getting as far as possible).\n\nEndurance:\nEndurance mode is exactly how it sounds. It is made to see how far you can go before you and your party dies by the enemies. Endurance is the main game itself. This is the only mode where you can get achievements (For now), and is the only mode that you can not save your progress in. This means that you will have to spend MANY hours playing through the game. Even though the gamemode is built for running through the world without stopping, the gamemode has many downsides. For example, you only start with a pistol and a small amount of ammo, so getting the resources to continue, such as stronger weapons and lots of ammo is very hard to do. This is because the enemies are kind of Overpowered at the beginning and can pretty much 2 shot you to death. I have never once in my life seen a group actually have the motivation to just run immediately without sitting at spawn and mine for hours on end. The alternative to doing this is to sit in spawn and create a mine to get better weapons, then run. This makes grinding needed, as diamonds are required in VERY large numbers to get really good items to be able to have a fun running journy without needing to hide from enemies 24/7. (This is how I personally see this game mode). Also, overpowered dragons spawn almost immediately after running and they have well over all of your 200 bullets of health and can destroy your structures that you make without giving a damn, making your pistol absolutely useless until you upgrade it with a lot of resources. However, the game mode in itself is okay when you drop down to the depths of hell and grind for diamonds (With music <3) for a few hours to get around 100+ diamonds, which barely scratches the surface on how many you actually need to even get past the second area of the game (They drop in very large numbers by the enemies in hell, you just need to make the ability to get back up to store them). The whole point of this gamemode is to run to the "Hell on earth", which is 1500+ meters out and kill the strongest enemy in the game, the "Undead Dragon". Other than a few things that need to be reconsidered by the Devs, like the anti-saving bs, I think it is a fun and recommendable gamemode.\n\nSurvival:\nSurvival is exactly how it sounds. Because the game does not have much of a creative mind to it (Such as doors not being able to be double-doors and most building materials being able to be destroyed by enemies), the point of this game mode is mainly to just mess around with a saveable map. This gamemode also allows you to teleport to friends and to the spawn, which is nice for if you are stuck somewhere (Which the alternative in Endurance is to just click "restart game" which doesn't delete anything and restarts everyone to Day1 at the spawn). This gamemode also gives you the ability to choose how the enemies spawn (at night only, or at night and in new territory). Personally, I do not recommend this gamemode to anyone who is playing, because it is really pointless and isn't very fun after an hour or two. If you want to be able to save and have a fun gamemode for just messing around and killing enemies, just do creative. I'd recommend for this gamemode to be able to have a creative side to surviving, so you can have more than just "killing zombies for hours" as a reason to play the game and get very involved in it.\n\nCreative:\nThis is NOT the kind of Creative mode that you are thinking right now. This is almost the exact opposite. The idea of creative mode is that it is the SAME thing as survival, but instead all resources don't deplete. That means that if you make an AK with 5 iron (After mining the iron), you still have 5 iron in your inventory and the AK. You can not spawn items in or enemies in. You still have to find and mine all resources to be able to get stuff, meaning that you are going to have to still mine over 50 bloodstone to make an AK. This gamemode doesn't really suit the name, Creative, as it is the same exact thing as the previous gamemode, but with a duplicating backpack. Personally, I only see this gamemode as fun if you are just wanting to mess around and just build the most powerful items in half the time it takes to do it in any other game mode.\n\nIn conclusion:\nThis game needs a lot of improvement before it can be really called a "Fully made game". I fully trust that the Devs know what they are doing, but I haven't seen a major update in a while, so I'm starting to lose hope. This game would be nice if you just have spare money lying around and want a mess-around game without buying and modding Minecraft a lot. I ended up being really stupid and I bought the game when the Developers were really full of themselves and made the game like 20 dollars. Remember, that I probably have a different taste that you who is reading this, but I can guarantee that it is not worth it at the current moment. Unless they change this game, I won't remove this review, however the CMZ2 might actually lift off somewhere it if goes through!\n\nTL:DR---\nThis game is not worth it at all. If you really want this game, you are gonna have to take it as it is, because it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere soon.\n\n::EDIT:: DDNA Stated This: "It isn't official but here is the deal. We are limited to what we can do with CMZ, partly because the code is old and partly because it is based on XNA for the Xbox. XNA makes it nearly impossible for us to port to other consoles, MAC etc.\n\nIf we moved to the new tech we are using for Savage Lands, we could do so much more and easily hit all these platforms. I would love to make a really awesome version of the game that has some amazing stuff. It just isn't possibly to do this by continually patching the game."\n\nI put this on the trello board because I wanted to get a feel for how the community feels about this. Do people really want micro updates to the existing game, or would they rather have a game that is way better overall?","January 6, 2015","false","24.6"," 44 of 78 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","44","78","6","4"

There is nothing to explore, horrific monsters to slay are horrificly animated, visuals are laughtable, gameplay is dull, sounds are awful, even procedural generation of terrain always end up generating almost the same terrain (for gameplay reasons I presume, still it's was bad design decision in the first place). At least it's cheap, can't argue with that. You may actually have some fun if you have unfussy friends to play it with you. I have none, thus saying 20 mins of gameplay is enough to never touch this thing again with a ten foot pole\nStill there is ton of better games.\n\nAlso: The game got it's Mostly Positive rating because users are mocking it and making joke reviews.\n\nAlso: Released with controller support then cut it out completely in favor of new UI (which is trash anyway).

If you want to play a Minecraft style game then buy bloody Minecraft, Its like 27 Dollars, If thats too much for you too pay and you want a cheap alternative, well this isn't it, start saving up those pennies of yours and buy Minecraft.

There's a part of me that likes this game and there's a part of me that doesn't like this game. It is a rip off yes, but it has enough new ideas to reedeem itself of being a rip off. I'm probably cnfusing quite a few of you with this opening so I'll just get into the review.\n\nGameplay/playability\n\nFor those of you that haven't figure out the clown standing in front of you hnking his nose in front of you, this game is a minecraft rip off and it doesn't exactly seem too afraid to show that. Now you might be thinking that if it's a rip off, why not get minecraft. Well, there are a few things this game has over the original game it's ripping off. The most distinctive difference that everyone notices is that this game has guns that actually function well, unlike the guns that modders have been trying to put into Minecraft for years. CastleMiner Z also has challenge, like MineCraft did, but the thing is about this is that it sort of adds into the challeneg but it also takes some of the challenge out. The basic objective of Minecraft was to survive, gathering food, cook it in a stove while stocking up on coal, keeping your health high. Your main objective in MineCraft was to reach The End, defeat the Ender Dragon. In CastleMiner Z, hunger no longer applies, which already takes away half of the challenge MineCraft had and you might be saying "They did this so it wasn't a complete rip off" I say "They use the same block style of MineCraft, that's probably as obvious as an elephant trying to fit in at a mice gathering" CastleMiner Z takes that Ender Dragon boss battle at the end of MineCraft and places different dragons throughout the world you inhabit. You might be thinking that it's great to fight tons of dragons like the ender dragon tons fo times but I beg to differ. The thing that made the Ender Dragon boss battle good in MineCraft was because you could only do that once in your playthrough and you fealt really accomplished and triumphant when you defeated this dragon and destroyed all of it's crystals. With CastleMiner Z, it takes the lazy route to combat where there's no challenge and just blaze bullets out on the dragons and even though I fealt triumphant after beting my 1st dragon, it quickly wore off as I progressed. Another thing that makes me dislike CastleMiner Z over MineCraft is its objective. MineCraft had you go all  over the place surviving, going to the nether and fighting the Ender Dragon. Now, with the basic premise of survival gone in CastleMiner Z (due to the lack of a hunger bar and regenerating helath) what does it do instead to keep the player entertained? Nothing. Without this premise, CastleMiner Z sort of feels pointless. It gives you the objective of moving North as far as you can but, it again doesn't show much challenge while throwing this weird objective at you. There are other game modes yes, but there are games that have pulled these game modes off better than CastleMiner Z did. I can easily understand why people might find these gamemodes fun but MineCraft was unique and CastleMiner Z tries to wrap up this weird deformed child of MineCraft and COD which isn't exactly a great combination, at least in my eyes. For people that enjoy this sort of concept, you will spend tons of time on this guaranteed, however if you're like me, you will get bored of this game quite quickly.\n\nGraphics/Sound\n\nThe graphics is one of my main praises towards the game. I actually found CastleMiner Z really appealing to look at. It has this great tint to the blocky...blocks to make them have this blend of realism nd make them look like they belong there. If you don't believe me, take a look at the screenshots. The sounds to this game is a mixed bag. While the sounds to everything is good, they're inconsistant. The sounds that have been used for everything, doesn't sound like they belong in one place, it's sort of like if you get unity assets and then top them off with RPG maker assets and a blend of Unreal engine assets. While the sounds are fitting to what they have been designated to, none of these sound like they should fit together.\n\nThere are some really good ideas used in CastleMiner Z and underneath all of these issues I have talked about, there is definately a good game under here somewhere but I'm just not seeing it unearth yet.\n\nPros\n+ Adds in new ideas to redeem it being a rip off\n+ Cheap\n+ Good graphics\n+ Some will enjoy the gameplay\n\nCons\n- Boring gameplay\n- Useless objectives\n- Little to no challenge\n- Inconsistant sounds\n\nFinal verdict: 5/10\n\nMy Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 21","false","5.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","7","13","3","0"

Lastly for those of you still questioning the pros and cons, everything is good in this game except, the mining dust(gets annoying) and killing "satan"(one of the biggest parts of the game) and not getting much value from the hard work killing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/butterpup/recommended/253430/","butterpup","Okumura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/butterpup/","117 products in account","First thing you will notice is it's a clear rip of Minecraft. That aside, there is an actual goal rather than boring sandbox stuff. Rather than how far underground you go, more exciting things happen the further away you get from the spawn point (Spire), measuring distance in blocks at the top right. The weapons and bullets and junk are all the same, but it's essential to make weapons and tools out of rarer materials as the zombies, skeletons, demons, and aliens get pretty hard to kill. Not to mention random dragons flying around like it's Skyrim. It's fun cranking up the difficulty and seeing how long you can hold out in a fort, or hauling your items with you as you try to reach the farthest distance you can and digging a pit at night to stay safe from the infinite swarm of zombies.\n\nNow the cons. Not too many, most of them are a tad annoying but it takes getting used to. But dying is definitely the worst. If playing on normal difficulty or under, when you die every item that's not in your hotbar gets dropped and you appear back at spawn maybe fifty blocks away or six-thousand; just like in minecraft. But the items dissappear after a few mere seconds, so unless you died pretty close all your hard earned ores and junk will dissappear before you reach them. Though this problem is pretty much removed if you play with friends, as they can pick up your dropped junk.\n\nOverall a pretty interesting game, definitely worth playing on a Friday night with some other losers.","March 23, 2014","true","15.1"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","0"

Castleminer Z is obviously supposed to be played with a group meaning if you decide to try to solo this (heaven forbid try that on endurance mode) you're going to die... horribly. This game needs to be balanced for single player, melee enemies sometimes hit you twice, bringing you down to next to no health, the game explains absolutly nothing to you like, zombies can break sand and dirt, dragons blow up sand and dirt and higher teir blocks depending on the type of dragon, gold weapons do more damage than iron, diamond weapons do more damage than gold (ect). However, with that said it's something I could see worth picking up if it was on sale, with the pricetag of 10 bucks (4 times what I paid for console) it's a bit tougher telling anyone to buy it.\n\nNegatives aside, pricetag aside, stupid, screaming little kids telling me to "kil teh dargoyn"  it's a pretty neat game. You have endurance mode, presents quite a bit of a challenge though again, they need to balance it. It has a few little gadgets like the teleporter, the anti-dragon guided missile. The weapons sound... alright, I think they could have done a bit better but in an indie title sound is the first thing to go, and understandibly so.\n\nSo to wrap it up... Yea, it's alright though it is a multiplayer game and the community sucks, play with a friend or risk punching a hole through your screen in frustration. Pick it up if it ever goes on sale if you're not willing to deal with the bugs.","March 2, 2014","true","31.5"," 45 of 89 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","45","89","2","0"

Here we have NounNoun- and there's not even a space between the two words! It also suffers from "title is non-indicative of game content, better tack on a Z to show it has zombies."\n\nAs for the game itself? It's utter garbage. I can appreciate that it still took them time to make, but to go and sell this for $5 is a horrible error in judgement, and should be observed as such. "Oh but Law, you haven't even played it for more than an hour!" You're damn right I didn't. I played it for 8 minutes I think, and it's no hyperbole when I say that's all it took to see all the game had to offer. To be fair, 5 of those 8 minutes I spent in the pause menu, because I got up to make a sandwich.\n\n0/10 It wasn't even a good sandwich and I had to make a deal with the Devil to get my 8 minutes back.","November 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 46 of 91 people (51%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","51","46","91","15","1"

Still very enjoyable nonetheless. The graphics are good. The firearms are decent at the least. The bullets arc through the air, but are effective. The aliens' appearances are unique, if not amongst themselves. Every tool does exactly what it's supposed to do, though they could last a bit longer by not being damaged from every strike on whatever block, but instead being damaged from every resource mined, dug, hacked, etc. Teleporting is a very nice feature, one not many games of this genre have. I don't like being disconnected from servers, but the plus side is that I automatically get a copy of the world I was playing in, meaning I can loot everyone's stuff and grief whatever I feel has been done wrong. The ideas aren't very original, but the game makes up for it with all it's exciting features. Overall, this game is above average. Not much is wrong with it.","June 15, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

More logical explanations like hell being deep underground. The creative mode is more adventuring then the one in MC. Despite the zombies looks (Which are actually good) Overall the game is ASTONISHING.  Gives a more immersive survival and even a more immersive mode called endurance. And a better one called dragon endurance. Xbox version maybe better but it's now available to more users.

You could mine, craft, build, explore, and fight zombies and dragons, but thats where the makers stopped updating the game. I mean sure, its fun for the first few hours when you have nothing and have plans to get the best weapons the game has to offer, and the best base you can possably build, but once you do that it's pretty  much go to the surface kill mobs, run out of ammo, make more ammo, and do it again. The developers abandoned this game to work on a new game which has recently been released. Upon completing that project they returned to CastleMinerZ to get new content out, but those ideas were brought to a halt when realizing the code was old and unable to be used. Recently they have been talking about a possable CastleMinerZ 2. So I would reccomend waiting to see if they decide to make that instead of wasting your money on this game.","July 16, 2015","false","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is very cheap but I think that the game would be better if it was free to play allthough I know the developers were not making that much money from the game (this lead to updates taking mounths to come out). I dont understand why this game has mixed reviews I have been playing since the launch on the xbox 360 indie market place and I have had alot of fun and good times playing with my friends. I know alot of people see this as a "minecraft clone" witch is true in one perspective. But the thing is that minecraft is a very popular game and so people are going to make games based on the block like world we know as minecraft, Its the same as every other genre or type of game. There are horrible minecraft clones and there are ones that are allmost more fun in some ways than minecraft its self minecraft clones.

Played for 11 hours today with a friend. ended up having way more stuff then we really needed and when we faced the undead dragon we had 8 anti dragon rocket luncher each. We ended up exploring further incase we missed something, but that was it. I felt like the game could have had more stuff, something more to explore, or something more to do. Like a tradeable village or more bosses or dungeon kind of thing, empty wherehouse for example. The game just felt short and if we hadnt spent hours mining (had around 1000 diamonds) we would have probly played lots less because it felt kinda like lack of content.

The game is very cheap but I think that the game would be better if it was free to play allthough I know the developers were not making that much money from the game (this lead to updates taking mounths to come out). I dont understand why this game has mixed reviews I have been playing since the launch on the xbox 360 indie market place and I have had alot of fun and good times playing with my friends. I know alot of people see this as a "minecraft clone" witch is true in one perspective. But the thing is that minecraft is a very popular game and so people are going to make games based on the block like world we know as minecraft, Its the same as every other genre or type of game. There are horrible minecraft clones and there are ones that are allmost more fun in some ways than minecraft its self minecraft clones.

He said it was cheap and that it was multiplayer.\n\nSuddenly, I had an idea. Let's stream this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nI originally went to look for it, hoping it would be as cheap as it was for him (he paid like a cent I believe), but sadly it was marked back up to $4.00 USD. Given that I didn't have $4.00 USD at the time on steam, I asked some members of my community if they'd buy it for me so I could stream it with my friend. My request was quickly accepted and I was bought this game with a lovely message that I'll leave out of this review because of Steam's rules and guidelines.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet, I had this tiny game installed. Under the assumption that we would have a short bit of autistic fun, we set out on our little adventure.\n\nOur stream lasted about 3 hours or so in total and we actually ended up enjoying the hell out of it, if not only for the fact that it is super basic and that you don't have to think about it at all.\n\nPros:\n- Super simple.\n- Hilariously over simplified crafting.\n- Hilarious death animations.\n- Hours of stupid fun with friends.\n- Pretty easy gameplay mixed with random occurances of moderately difficult combat (depending where you are and how far you are into your world).\n- Skeletons\n- Runs on literally anything.\n- Hilarious animations in general.\n- You can avoid almost all fall damage by jumping before you hit the ground.\n- No stress involved.\n- Dirt cheap.\n- Probably a few more but this is all I can think of right now.\n\nCons:\n- Awful graphics (Almost a pro for us, simply for hilarity).\n- Really basic and repetitive gameplay. (Also almost a pro because you don't have to worry about ♥♥♥♥.)\n- Very few enemies, just mild reskins of each.\n- Very few weapons, sometimes not even reskinned.\n- Glitchy at times. (I've had some issues crafting.)\n- Is no longer like, a cent.\n- Stamina system is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- Damage system has gone full ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- A few more but nothing major that I can think of.\n\nOver all, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game but can quickly devolve into mindnumbing fun with friends (and trust me, you do need friends).\n\nRating: 6.5 / 7 out of 10.","May 17","true","7.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If you haven't played it on the xbox 360, I would try this out if you can pick it up for $.99 (currently 3 or 4 dollars when I wrote this review). If you have played it on 360, there a few new things that were added such as respawn beacons and teleports (permanent ones) that could amuse you.\n\nOriginally, I was never going to buy this game on PC. I played extensively on 360 and even bought all the Digital DNA titles that gave perks for CMZ (basically $1 dlc) and made it around 20000 blocks or so from the start in Endurance (whatever they call the non-save mode) and didn't really want to go through the game again.\n\nThen I saw the updates and things they added recently and thought, "Hey, they did something with this finally. Maybe they are going to keep updating regularly." Well, I'm not sure how much dedication is going into this as they currently have their project Savage Lands to work on (going really well actually, updates monthly give or take a week). But to finish my thought, those measly updates they pushed out with a few new blocks and a couple new items were not worth my repurchase of this game. Not to mention this is a really old engine, so even if there is a major update of CMZ it will probably be a new game.\n\nThere's very little replayability to this game once you beat the undead dragon (final boss) unless you help your friends through to beat him (which I did a few times). Typically the grind to getting the gear to beat the dragon then traveling out to the 4000 some distance to fight him takes 4ish hours by yourself and maybe an hour or 2 with friends. The fight can be difficult or overly easy. First time I fought the dragon, there were only bloodstone weapons in the game. I didn't succeed before one of the fireball vollies managed to kill me in my floating base. The next time I actually took the time to go out to kill the dragon in endurance mode was when the alien update was released. That time I used the Dragon Seeking Missiles to fight him and built my base on the ground out of space goo. Two missiles and I won. I went "Oh, okay. Glad that wasn't a pain." But any veteran of CMZ can tell you, once you fight one dragon, you've fought them all, so don't expect much.\n\nSo basically the game boils down to - Grind. March. Die. March. Die. March and finally make it. Die. March back by teleporting. Kill the undead dragon and then rarely, if ever, play again. But remember, this was (and still is) an Indie game! It is well worth a dollar. $1 That's about it though. 2-20 hours of play time.\n\n","May 25","false","4.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

That's a relief. I enjoy it, but it's buggy and unfinished. I don't see anything happening to improve the development. Avoid it. Another reviewer mentioned he would rather drag his private bits through 70 miles of ground glass or something like that. I thought he was going easy on the developers.

Skeleton, Zombie) but the entire game is totally different. Sadly the game does not live up to the Xbox 360 version. The graphics are WAY behind the Xbox (Isn't PC usually updated before console? and no i dont pay to much attention to graphics, they dont make a better game). The mouse sensitivity feels like its on the highest setting when it is at its lowest. its pretty laggy. you cant use gamepad. It looks nothing like the Xbox version.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heyhotstuff/recommended/253430/","heyhotstuff","sock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heyhotstuff/","36 products in account","The action packed strategy game brings a whole new view on tactical combat to computer in such a way, we can’t quite remember how long ago our jaws had smashed to the ground.\n\nThe purpose of this online game is to break through the enemy’s defences and basically lay waste to their base with the help of minions. With 5 players in both sides, each player picks a hero from the character pool. Each hero has a special style of gameplay, support to help your allies or tank to beast it out and destroy your opponents with ease.\n\nThe level up and economy system is quite intriguing. Your gold slowly trickles in, but you get bonus coins if you land the last strike on an enemy hero or minion. You gain experience for every opponent that falls in your area.\n\nYou can use your coins to purchase items that heal you, replenish your mana (which is used for spells), or boost your stats so you hit harder, run faster or just generally makes you become better at ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up. You can even combine these items to make other items and become near unstoppable. These items can even turn the tide of the battle.\n\nOne of the few negatives is that the respawn time can take a bit too long. As the game goes on, the respawn time becomes longer and when you die: you could be waiting for over two minutes before you’re brought back into the action. You can use your coins to buy yourself back into the game, if needed.\n\nSome can find the tutorial too long, and if you’re like me (an idiot): you can get impatient, quit the tutorial, and then have to do it all over again. It does give you a lot of information on how to play the game properly and get really stuck into it, but the game also allows you to coach other players or be coached by other players. This allows friends to help each other play the game and is really the best way to play and learn. When you are coaching or being coached, you also earn bonus, out of game experience which lets you level up and receive items for your heroes.\n\nThis game is definitely worth trying out. The fact that you can get such an epic game for free is mind blowing. You can even play offline matches against bots (also a fun way to practice). We’ve even wanted more games to be like Dota. We can not stop recommending this game.\n\nETC Rating: 9/11","April 26, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","6","13","4","0"

I also had a combo that made EVERYTHING invisible.\n\nSeriously, save your money. I played Castleminerz on Xbox and actually had a pretty good time. It's not a bad game, when it works.

If you do not like zome undead killing action you can jus play on peaceful. However, there is still some cons this game has. such as it is always dark I would really like if there was a sun every once in a while. Also there is a performane issue i get 120Fps on this game but every 5 minutes i get a sudden frame skip which is really annoying. Another thing is that the mouse sensitivity is not ajustable for me. I try to adjust it but it does not make a diference. But the game is very fun in terms of getting resources, fighting the undead, and also makeing guns to do so. I really hope while this game is under devalopement that they will add more guns and blocks. Also I beleive you should be able to spawn items instead of look for them and then have unlimited amount of them.","October 31, 2014","true","73.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Exactly, there's no fun in that.\n\nGraphics	I will be straight to the point - Graphics look like ♥♥♥♥.\nThe player model is way shorter than the actually POV of the model and that's very noticable if you play with a friend.\nThe player model is a normal human dwarf that lives in a world made of blocks... it's doesn't really fit well together.\n\nCrafting	It's pretty much the same as Minecraft console editions, there really isn't any need for me to go that deep.\n\n\nPros.	+There are times that I had fun in these games and that was with friends, don't bother playing alone since you will get bored in around 15 minutes.\n+Somewhat understandable crafting system.\n\nCons.	-Sub-par gameplay that's directly ripped off from Minecraft.\n-Crappy graphics that look worse than Super Mario Bros. for the NES.\n-Really mediocre presentation in terms of menu and the font used for the different options you can select in the menu.\n-Really difficult to get into. (Atleast for me and my brother).\n-Crappy animations.\n\nFinal Verdict\n6.8/10\nWhile this isn't a good game by any means, I had some fun the first 2 hours.","May 24, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

DUST! DUST IN MY EEEEYYYYEEEESSSS!!!!!!!!\n\nFor a game of 2014 you'd expect it not to look like a minecraft/quake hybrid and at least have the textures work properly.. half an hour after i started the world my torch texture dissapeared, and a few minuites after that the game crashed and just told me:  error, the game crashed, we are trying to fix this  my mouse was still locked off the screen so i had to press enter to close the screen and the game, i attempted to log onto my world again... it crashed before it loaded with the same screen.. i tried again and this time it  loaded! and i found out it was a great game and wasnt another crappy rip off and we lived happily ever after   NOPE.. it only loaded the torches... and you.. everything thing i held was invisible and every block and mob except torches.. i logged off.. logged back on... and of course it was the exact same thing... i close it down, uninstall the game and find myself here\n\nive read some other reviews.. and the comments on them seem to be things like "nyot evry spuar gmae is mincraeft" and "its not a minecraft ripoff because its harder and has more things!"\nto which i say: excuse me  HAVE YOU LOOKED THROUGH THE GAME??!!??  you have shovels, pickaxes, axes, iron, gold, diamond, zombies, skeletons with bows, dragons, hell, 16-bit textures and even the bad AI.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/recommended/253430/","Stoneth","Stoneth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/","1103 products in account","There are certain games that take inspirations and ideas presented in other games and use them to create new and interesting experiences that in their new form have considerable merit. And then there are games that make it appear that the developer isn't even trying or just attempting to cash in on an idea that is immensely popular at the moment. CastleMiner Z is an example of the latter.\n\nA gathering and crafting game with a focus on making guns to combat the undead in a procedurally generated voxel-based world, CastleMiner Z feels like it is trying to combine Minecraft and Day Z, but fails to properly capture the essence of either. As a zombie game, CMZ will frustrate you with unpredictable and seeminly overpowered zombies that will kill you without warning and cause you to lose your inventory. As an exploration game, CMZ will feel repetitive through it's lack of variety in enemies and otherwise barren environments. And as a creative game, CMZ horribly fails since the only thing you can build are guns, ammunition, metal blocks, doors and lights.\n\nThat is not to say the game is completely bad. The graphics are pretty decent, the crafting system is very intuitive thanks to the menu interface, and it has a strong focus on guns. But if you are looking for a deep experience where you make your own progression through better gear with the creation of an architectural masterpiece on the side, you will not find it here. The game admittedly is very low priced, but as they say, you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a really good voxel-based game that allows for actual creative options and is on Steam, I would recommend Block Story instead.","December 7, 2014","false","6.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

From its beautiful graphics to its addicting gameplay this game takes your breath away every step you take. If you love minecraft, counterstrike, Call of Duty Zombies, and ingesting lots of hallucinogens, this game is a must buy on any platform. The mele combat has to be the best I have ever seen in a videogame to date. The gunplay overtakes such games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty. The weapon choices are some of the most creative and most varied selection in videogame history. The game: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a clear rip off of Castle Miner Z's dragon combat, using wit and superior battleskills to take down the mighty dragons. Dragons come in many forms, which provides a nice change of pace, because we all know how boring yelling at a dragon is!  For an extreme deal of $4.99, this product is way to underpriced for its overall gameplay value. If you want to take this experience to the next level try using a gamepad or just simply play it on the Xbox 360! But wait! There is more! Did i mention you can play with any of your friends. No more hastle of making a minecraft server! You can even teleport to your friends without even typing in a single word! This stellar online experience far exceeds the multiplayer immersion of major multiplayer games like World of Warcraft. If you do not have this game, are missing out on a true experience that will change the course of history as we know it!

Los equipos son pequeñas, las armas son letales, y rondas son cortos. Hay un adictivo calidad solo de uno más asaltos a ella, porque hay un constante deseo de hacer mejor que la última vez, para ganar una matanza satisfactoria, o para ganar de una manera nueva. Llamada de veterinarios de derechos e Battlefield se preguntará por qué no pueden correr para escapar del fuego enemigo o mirar hacia abajo las vistas del hierro para mejorar objetivo; Jugadores de Castlleminer Z se sentirán como si entraron en su casa redecorado. Ciertos rediseños mapa cogerán fans hardcore con la guardia baja, pero los cambios son para el mejor - el cuello de botella en el paso subterráneo de_dust, por ejemplo, tiene una nueva ruta de escape.\n\nIncluso en la cara de la evolución género, Castlleminer Z no le importa que adaptarse. Miner Z es tan dedicado a los ideales de envejecimiento de Castlleminer Z pesar de mercado y cambios de tendencia que bruta fuerzas de su camino al éxito. Parte de lo que lo convierte en un juego competitivo como atractivo es que matar en Global Offensive requiere un conjunto de habilidades totalmente diferente a los otros tiradores. Todo el mundo se limita a lo que tienen y se puede ver, con poco margen para la modificación de carácter o ventajas sobre la marcha. Correr y disparar es un estilo de juego inútil, incluso si usted ha comprado un casco y kevlar esa ronda, hasta el punto de que alguien de pie todavía es más probable que anotar la matanza.

Minecraft is no longer the only "block building" game in town. With so many different games out there like Blockland, FortressCraft, Guncraft, and CastleMiner Z - it's easy for people to complain that each new iteration in the genre is a "shameless cash grab". CastleMiner Z might fall under that classification, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fun game. I have put a couple hours into this game and have had a good time. I would recommend it, especially since it is such a cheap game.

I reccomend this game very much, Theres these game Modes: Endurance which is see how far you can get in the Blocky crazy world. Next is Survival; Which is quite easy to tell what it is meant to be about just survive, visit crash sites and build and enjoy! Now Its Dragon Endurance, which you fight dragons after dragons and so on, Unlock it By killing the UNDEAD Dragon in Endurace you will unlock it. Now Creative, as you break a block you then get unlimited of it/ingots/blocks/ammo. You cant fly like mincraft and dont have unlimited health also. NOTE: This is basicly minecraft with guns and instead of the Ender Dragon in the end, There everywhere! NOTE: this has some VERY glitchs such as An xray glitch which is awesomely works but to me i dont like it as its noobish/and i dont find any ores. :/ NOTE: If you find a crash site > (O) Which contains aliens, Ores, Space Rock and space goo, But i call Them:Space poo and space ♥♥♥♥ xD  you can only mine space poo and space ♥♥♥♥ with a Bloodstone pickaxe. Use bloodstone for weapons, tools. Theres Diffucultys; No enemies AKA peaceful, Easy, Wheres the monster and dragons cannot destroy your bases; Normal which is enemies will appear at night and dragons can destroy your strutures and where ever you put blocks monster swarm that place at night. Now HARDCORE which you dont start off with ANYTHING and when you die you lose EVERTHING. if your on easy/normal EVERYTHING in your hotbar will stay NOT your inventory. The stuff you spawn with is A Stone pickaxe,12 or 16 torchs, Pistol with 200 bullets :D. I hope you like my Review about castle miner z and i hope you like it!

Like any good zombie survival game, you start off in the middle of absolute nowhere, with only the task to survive at hand. You steadily find ores that take several hours to mine just so you can compact and smelt them into pure metal bars with your sheer force of will, from these metal bars, you can create any gun imaginable if your only prior experience with guns is Call Of Duty. You'll steadily work your way through the ranks of guns, starting out with a simple metal gun and working your way up to a gun made of pure diamonds and gold. Then if your feeling daring enough you can venture outside of your mancave into the far lands just outside your door and face the multiple dragons which definitely arent textures stolen from World of Warcraft despite looking just like your average black dragon flight. After fighting the constant onslaught of dragons you can fend of the Alien Invaders which for some reason desire the zombie infested paradise you reside in, and you can spend what feels like an eternity just trying to kill one before his buddy shanks you from behind killing you instantly.\n\nTheres not really much more to say, as the game was so good I had to stop playing just incase I had a heart attack at how obviously better this game is than leading competitors such as Minecraft, DayZ and every other totally original Minecraft clones out there.\n\nIn conclusion, I would give this game a solid 1/10 and a sticker for attempting to try at attempting to create a game.","August 26, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

You play as a normal SWAT Member in a completely blocky world full of Zombies and Skeletons and Dragons. I wish this game was satire or a parody, because then I'd at least have the solace of knowing that someone didn't actually think this was remotely a good idea, nonetheless a FINISHED PRODUCT.

The first thing that happened when I played single player was me getting attacked by zombies endlessly. First things first, the zombies are horribly made. They jump like theyre on the moon and kill you in 2-3 hits, which is absurd in its own. Zombies also spawn randomly at random places, which is just frustrating in its own right. They also break blocks which makes creating a wooden house useless because its going to be molested and destroyed the first night anyway. Not to mention also that the health is just completely broken dispite it looking quite simple. If they were going to copy MC, why not just have hearts instead of a health bar that drains so damn quick. This wouldnt be a problem if armour was a thing. The early game guns are trash at best, and the late game ones I havent even gotten to try because every time I die due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of the early game guns my inventory clears and theres no way to recover it. It also annoys me how day is so short, but night is so long. When I first played I just learned the game and it was already night and me getting ♥♥♥♥♥ in all my slots. It is also left out that the durability of tools in this game is non existent in the sense that pickaxes break after about 50 blocks broken and guns break after around 1500 bullets shot. The redeeming thing about this game is the multiplayer in which playing this game solo is frustrating to the point of cutting your ♥♥♥♥ off with a meat cleaver.\n\n6.5 / 10: Needs many updates to fix problems here listed, also not mentioning the countless other ones listed in other reviews.","April 3, 2015","false","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Literally not one.\n\nWorlds are literally carbon copies of Minecraft ones, only there's a lighthouse to serve as a checkpoint. It's indestructible. Hell is like it is in Terraria, only you don't need to go far to get into it. Basically 50 Y levels down is a total drop into hell, pretty much. Hell has nearly no reason to exist, quite literally.\n\nDragons are in this from skyrim, Zombies are in this, skeletons too, that's all you'll have for enemies.\nZombies kill you in three hits, Skeletons too, Dragons do so instantly. Hit detection is literally barebones. Damage is dealt before the proper time in the animations.\n\nThis game has less content than freaking StarForge for crying out loud. Starforge atleast has 4 tiers of tools, and even weaons of different types, and 4 tiers of armors, vehicles, blocks to create your bases with, and terminals to serve as faster crafting stations and a respawn in hte form of a bed... Even chest-like containers\nThis game however has only 5 block types to craft, 4 tiers of tools, 4 tiers of 2 weapons, no crafting stations, 2 chest types, no armors, no vehicles.\n\nSeriously. This game is literally Counter-Strike: Minecraft with 2% of the content, none of the mod support, no ability to make texture packs and easily install them and even swap between them... and all for the literal same price of Minecraft, or Terraria, take your pick.\n\nThis game, like Starforge is basically evidence that you can make money off of nothing but other people's hard work and that we need a Storefront Quality Control team.\n\nSure, there's a mode called Endurance where you don't save the world, and dying is permanent, but it serves no real purpose. It's just an obligatory "Hard" difficulty.\n\nGet Minecraft. This game, like Starforge, is a Crime against Gaming itself.\nPlagarism. The Devs need to learn what that is, and Steam too, due to it still being here.\n\nThe ONLY thing is has over Minecraft, is it's server browser.\n\nThis game isn't worth downloading, it isn't worth a dollar, it isn't worth even even one tenth of your dog's crap.\n\nIt isn't difficult and the game is designed by someone who is clearly not old enough to know what.\n\nFinal Note: This game has basically no reason to exist. Watching paint dry is more enjoyable and you'll be more likely to do it after buying.","April 5, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I played for 1 hour and after that hour got up and deleted it off my desktop and walked away. One day I was bored and redownloaded this game and decided to give this game 1 hour to prove it's worth of 5 dollars. I sat down watched it download and pressed play. Lets just start off by saying I play CSGO, in CSGO I have my sensitivity at around 1.30-1.40. This game dosen't let you change your sensitivity at all. I'm basicly walking around while my mouse goes zooming around my screen at the slightest of movement. Don't even get me started on the nasty sounds or the hardcore amounts of damage you take along with the insane HP regen. The game is basicly a damn port from the xbox but somehow is WORSE than the xbox version. To conclude instead of giving this game 1 hour of my time I gave it 5 minutes and clicked EXIT. I guess for 5 dollars you can't go wrong but still its a waste.","May 4, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game's achievements beg you to play for hours at a time without a save option. It is annoying to have to invest into a game that doesn't give a damn to players who just want a block survival game. The very little motivation you get from the achievements is crushed by the fact that you must play on the punishing gametype "Endurance" which takes a large amount of fun out of the game and makes it feel like a grind with no checkpoints. There are few redeeming qualities of the game that are drowned out by its difficulty. (Not even going to mention how awful it is in single player) This, in conclusion, is a poor mans Minecraft, and if I were you, I'd just save my piggy bank for Notch himself.","August 31, 2015","false","78.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

The game's achievements beg you to play for hours at a time without a save option. It is annoying to have to invest into a game that doesn't give a damn to players who just want a block survival game. The very little motivation you get from the achievements is crushed by the fact that you must play on the punishing gametype "Endurance" which takes a large amount of fun out of the game and makes it feel like a grind with no checkpoints. There are few redeeming qualities of the game that are drowned out by its difficulty. (Not even going to mention how awful it is in single player) This, in conclusion, is a poor mans Minecraft, and if I were you, I'd just save my piggy bank for Notch himself.","August 31, 2015","false","78.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

Maybe it was because I was like 12 and my mind could be stimulated really easy (I can barely play a game for 10 minutes without getting bored now) but this game was the ♥♥♥♥.  I moved on to Xbox One, palyed some games, tried Wii U (Eugh), and now...\n\nNow I play pc and a new array of games are available to me, but I still remembered all the way back to 2011-2012, the indie game that brought me so much joy. So I'm very glad even though I don't play it really (Cuz I'm always so bored and I overplayed it back then -around multiple weeks worth of game time-) that I have it in my inventory.\n\nThanks for the memories.","May 7","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/encash/recommended/253430/","encash","๋Judge Judy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/encash/","199 products in account","I don't know why this game recieves so much criticism; sure, the graphics look like they're straight out of 2007, and maybe the sound effects aren't the greatest either, but there is so much fun to be found in this game.\n\nThere are several weapons and other tools the player can craft within this game, some including lazer weapons, lightsabers, light machine guns and everything in-between. Each weapon has many different "classes", each using different ammunition types. The better "class" your weapon is, the more damage it does; trust me, you're going to need the higher tier weapons.\n\nThe crafting is pretty self-explanatory as the game tells you what you can and can't craft, and shows you the materials for what you want to craft.\n\nThe gameplay itself is actually pretty fun; depending on your difficulty level, zombies will spawn at different times (on easy they spawn only at night, but anything higher they spawn pretty much every time.) Nevertheless, zombies will try and kill you no matter what is standing in their way. You think a dirt house will be sufficient enough to protect you? Nope. They will break the blocks surrounding your house and begin swarming inside of it. Not to mention, these mobs will literally spawn randomly from the ground, sometimes scaring you if you're caught off guard.\n\nDragons are also a huge part of this game. Every time you venture out far enough, a dragon will spawn and, depending on its color, it will have a certain amount of health points and a certain amount of loot for killing it. Overall, they're not too hard to kill if you have at least gold weapons, but otherwise, they will destroy your precious creations and annoy the living hell out of you.\n\nThere are also tons of "Loot Boxes" around the map that contain a lot of great loot; if you're not much of the mining type, just go after those and you'll get enough good materials to help you survive the game.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game an easy 7 out of 10. Sure, they game is a little bit outdated looking and maybe it has a few glitches, but I find it a bit better than its Minecraft counterpart. It's only $3.99 at the time of writing this review, and I really think it's worth picking it up. Whether you plan to play alone or with friends, I'd say it's worth the buy.","April 28","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The last update for it was May 2014 (nearly a year ago). It's safe to assume that we won't be seeing much more of a change from the developers in this one. Kind of serves as a watered down version of Minecraft and uses many of the same mechanics. If you are bored of Minecraft and have five dollars in spare change, give it a shot. You'll get about that much fun out of it. For what it's worth, I enjoyed my time.","March 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can barely do anything in the game before a zombie 2-shots you and you lose everything in your inventory.

I should mention that mining is the only way you can easily get back to 3100. Get to 3100, make a base. You are going to HAVE to run across hell. There is no way around or under hell. Have to go over. I typically stay around the 7-11 block mark above the bloodstone level. This is where I find the most diamond. once you hit 2100 then diamond clumps up on the lower levels. Then around 3100 it start to appear on land.\n\nYou can mine all the way to about 3200/3400 I think, but then you are slowly pushed to the surface. The bloodstone / hell threshold slowly is brought to the surface.\n\n\nDesert - Dig under\n\nMountains dig under or through.\n\nFrozen Hills dig under - need shovel for snow\n\nHell - Fortify - rush in, make a base, die.\n\n\nThe tele hop.\n\nThis is what you use to keep you far in the blocks. It is costly, but it’s really the only safe method of keeping you deep into the block count. Teleporters. The ace(s) up your sleeve. Drop a tele point at your base. Take another one, run as far as you can, drop it there. If you die, that’s fine. Tele back to your base. Pick up two more teles. (At this point you have 3) Drop one tele at your base. Use the tele you ran out with and got far with. As soon as you tele to your spot, drop a FRESH tele. (DON’T USE THE ONE TO YOUR BASE - THIS IS BAD AND WILL SET YOU BACK HOURS!!!)\n\nTips\n\nThis game is tough. It is brutal in fact. There are a lot of hard lessons that I’ve learned.\n\nI now have a few standard practices that really help make the going easier.\n\nCarry your bullets on your belt.\n\nCarry your most valuable if not most two valuable resources with you at all times.\n\nDon’t carry more than two guns, anything more is a waste of space.\n\nDon’t carry a melee weapon, use your pick.\n\nDon’t use lightsabers; sure, they are cool looking and make fancy noises, but they have a short shelf life and they take important resources to make.\n\nOnly have 1 or two harvesting tool on your belt. You’re not a farmer, you’re a survivor, there will be deaths. It is better to die carrying difficult to attain resources than lose them.\n\nONLY KILL WHAT YOU HAVE TO, RUN FROM WHAT YOU CAN\n\nYou will die, a lot, deal with it, work around the deaths. You can use death to your advantage…..\n\nUsing your death to your advantage. Each time you die, you go to a place that has both wood and sand. Before you TP back to your base, grab some resources. You will probably need sand, wood and coal at some point. Mainly for storage, torches, and teleporters. Pick some up, better to have and not need if anything.\n\nGet to laser weapons as fast as you can, HOWEVER, diamond is still plenty OP.\n\nGold is a step up about stone, but will not take you the distance. I have found that gold does not suffice for the trek across hell. Those zombies are vicious and need to die faster than gold will provide.\n\nLasers - you can kill both aliens and satan easily with laser weapons. You can simply run from either or murder them. They take a full clip or two from the assault rifle. You can use explosives if you have a lot.\n\nDon’t harvest in the open.\n\nDig a tunnel through earth and take what is given to you.\n\nWhen you need bloodstone don’t take what’s in the open!\n\nIt takes 21 hits with the diamond pickaxe to extract which is a long time.\n\nIt is best to dig into the side of a cave at the base of it and then block the entry way.\n\nharvest bloodstone in peace.\n\nCARRY A LOT OF TORCHES AND MARK YOUR WAY WITH THEM.\n\nYou can see torches from a long ways off and help you get back to where you need to go.\n\nUse specific formations to mark certain things.\n\nIf you go spelunking and you find diamond but don’t have the time to extract it mark it with a torch and get it later.\n\nZombies, skeletons, aliens, satan. Zombies come in different varieties with different behaviors; skeletons come in varieties. Aliens and satan are mele hard hitting champions.\n\n\nThe achievements make this game worth while.\n\nSome of them are indeed quite hard to attain.\n\nSelf Defense - Kill one enemy (12/6/2014)\n\nNo Fear - Kill 100 enemies (12/7/2014)\n\nShort Timer - Play for  one hour (7/13/2014)\n\nVeteran MinerZ - Play for 10 hours (9/2/2015)\n\nFirst Contact - Travel 50 block from start (12/6/2014)\n\nLeaving Home - Travel 200 blocks from start (12/7/2014)\n\nDesert Crawler - Travel 1000 blocks from start (12/7/2014)\n\nMountain Man - Travel 2300 blocks from start (12/13/2014)\n\nDeep Freeze - Travel 3000 blocks from start (12/13/2014)\n\nHell On Earth - Travel 3600 blocks from start (9/5/2015)\n\nAround the World - Travel 5000 blocks from start (9/5/2015)\n\nDeep Digger - Dig 20 blocks below the surface (12/6/2015)\n\nWelcome to Hell - Dig 40 blocks below the surface (12/13/2015) - Don’t dig straight down.\n\nSurvive the Night - Survive for 1 day (12/6/2014)\n\nOne Week Later - Survive for 7 days (12/7/2014)\n\n28 Day Later - Survive for 28 days (8/31/2015)\n\nSurvivor - Survive for 100 days (9/5/2015)\n\nTinkerer - Craft one items (12/6/2014)\n\nCrafter - Craft 100 items (12/7/2014)\n\nMaster Craftsman - Craft 1000 items (9/1/2015)\n\nZombie Slayer - Kill the undead dragon (9/5/2015) At 4200 block mark\n\nAlien Encounter - Get close to an alien (12/7/2015)\n\nAlien Technology - Make a kill with a laser weapon (8/31/2015)\n\nDemolition Expert - Craft TNT (11/28/2014)\n\nAir Defense - Kill a dragon with a guided missile (9/5/2015)\n\nFire in the Hole! - Kill an enemy with TNT (9/5/2015)\n\nBoom! - Kill an enemy with a grenade (9/5/2015)\n\nMinerZ Potato - Play for 100 hours - Not achieved.\n\n28 Weeks Later - Survive for 196 days - Not achieved.\n\nAnniversary - Survive for 365 days - Not achieved.","September 6, 2015","true","111.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A typical game to get to the end of the world goes something like this:\n\nSpawn\nGet underground\nStart making basic tools and weapons\nSurvive a few nights\nGet everything ready for your first expedition\nGo to the surface at the start of the day and get as far as you can\nGet back underground\nMine for better resources (that become more common as you get further out)\nStart making better tools and resources\nMake your second expedition at the start of the day\nGet as far as you can\nRinse and repeat\n\nAnd its fun. Simple and fun, and for only a few bucks, you're looking at several hours of gameplay. Get this game, get some friends, get some liquor, and the next time there's a dragon making a crater to get to you because you didn't get quite far enough underground and you and your friends are screaming as a horde of skeletons and zombies swarms you and your cave suddenly turns into a canyon of death, just remember that Lucky the Bear told you this game was a great idea.","August 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After a few in-game days, s#$% gets apocalyptic as hell. It's minecraft with guns, with way less of the complexity of minecraft. The enemies in the game are pretty legit. Running and hiding from them is a struggle. It's not the type of game that you play survival for eons and continue to "civilize" the world. You spawn, with a gun, and it's clear to see that there's gunna be zombies and other AI chasing you. You can harvest gold and diamonds and more, use minable materials to make batter tools/guns, and build whatever your little heart desires with different types of blocks. But the game's basically a very casual version of minecraft with guns and apocalypse.\n\nGuns + Minecraft+ Apocalypse - Stupid s$%# from Mincecraft = CastleMiner Z","July 28, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These are brutal and unforgiving yet fun to shoot in the face! the game also has some medeival elements such as dragons, lots of trees and the satisfying blacksmith hammer noise when you craft something. There are also some futuristic features such as lazer guns and swords if you ever wanted to be a jedi or storm trooper. If you don't like getting owned by the undead from the underworld, you can turn the monsters off. The game's visuals are amazing! It runs super quick even on my laptop! It still runs great even with a high visual setting. If building is more your cup of tea, then try the creative mode. I really like this game, and at such a low price the game is impossible to say no to. P.S. the game has a slight chance to slow down in the framerate department, so make sure your computer is well optimized!","July 15, 2015","true","59.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game has so much potential in making this game way better then the minecraft game.\n\nI would have to say building improvements could be a good update, such as building a fortress and adding gun turrets and other cool building items, like steel doors this may be possible i'm unsure.  My opionion as a gamer for over 25 years is there should always be quest set in  ending the darkness that has fallen upon the land would be cool, like dungeons and dragon eggs to destroy to wipe out the dragons and huge underground grave yard undead lairs with a undead king and a hidden item that was the cause of this pelage of darkness such as a meteorite that has fallen many years ago so the land has over grown and it is hidden way deep and very heard to fine, and some type of heated stone that cause your regular iron pieks unable to dig through. That a new quest to find a special item type to make a pike that you can dig through.

Please read on to see what I mean.\n\nI only recommend this game because of it's nearly unlimited fun it contains when playing with a group of friends (At least 2-4 other people). This isn't a game I would play alone because there isn't too much to do; once you get to laser weapons and such you're pretty much done. But with friends, you tend to ignore all the cons of this unpolished indie adventure game so to speak and just enjoy exploring and slaying enemies/dragons with your friends, making the experience much more enjoyable.\n\nNot to mention, you can get this game on the castle miner site for FREE. The only reason I see to purchase this via steam is to game with friends. To conclude, don't buy this game unless you have friends that are down for it. Besides all that, great game in my opinion, could use lots more work and updates but sadly the owners abandoned the game. Had great potential\n\nR.I.P Castle-Miner Z 8/8 would get chased by Satan again for another $2\n","July 3, 2015","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
