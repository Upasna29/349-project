The problem is that he has no memory of what transpired. And so the story begins as the king sends him on a simple mission, and Duncan slowly learns more about his past, and how to uncover the details ---- which is critical because dark forces are gathering once again.\n\nThere are a ton of things to do (with a good number of side quests), things to find, people to recruit and interact with, dungeons/mazes to explore, monsters to deal with, weapons and spells to master, and a narrator to interact with as you move through the land. The narrator is full of good humor, and adds an interesting perspective to the events of the game, as well as being very helpful to the beginning player.\nThere is as much interaction with non playing characters as I've seen in this type of game in a very long time ---- but it all adds to the exploring aspect. And this is a game where anything and everything needs to be examined for clues and information.\n\nThe artwork is beautiful throughout with battle scenes being especially well done.\n\nMusic is excellent without being obtrusive.\n\nAnd there are plenty of cut scenes adding to the story.\n\nThe care and attention to detail in Arvale are easy to see and certainly enjoy throughout this well crafted game that would be a fine choice for any player of any age, of any experience. A first-rate and engaging rpg adventure.\n","August 16, 2015","true","8.4"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

And I really enjoyed it until...\nUntil it got so incredibly slow that I could not get through a minor battle in less than 10 minutes.  It also lost any charm after a certain point as side-quests became few and far between, then non-existent.  Just go from one major boss battle to the next.  I finally quit playing as it was just too tedious going from battle to battle just to level up, then another 10-15 minutes trying to beat the boss who is ridiculously strong and ends up killing every party member just before his health runs out.  Such a bummer as this was so fun to begin with.  I'm sorry to say I would not recommend this game even at the really cheap price I paid for it (I think $2 or something like that).","March 28","false","29.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

No regrets so far. Something I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet is the Music! I'm not sure where these tracks came from, but many of them (the castle music and the first town in particular) are fantastic. Happy that the creators took the time to procure (or hire/make? I have no idea since there are no title credits) great tracks, a total must have for an RPG and in this case, it definitely ticks off that box.

Nevertheless, it is a fresh look at the genre, with lots of funny dialogue, and improved graphics. Mechanics battle are also returning to the old system of Final Fantasy - is not too complicated and easy to use, found a very delicate balance that I really like.\n\nThe graphics, as I mentioned, is different for 16-bit games. The soundtrack is very good.\nTo manage as there are no complaints, it's the usual keyboard and mouse.","January 21","true","10.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","8","11","4","0"

You always hear about random, unknown games on Steam that at first, seem pretty generic or cheap... but then turn out to be truly awesome, enjoyable games. THis is one of them. I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was based on the price, but man... I am hooked so far. Sure, it's a bit old nintendo looking, but I think that adds to its charm (and also gives some great jokes making fun of itself). Surprisingly, this is one of the few games I've actually enjoyed playing this year.","August 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

This old-school RPG takes me back to my Final Fantasy on SNES days. Yet it's a fresh take on the genre, with plenty of hilarious dialogue, and an almost graphic adventure-like treatment throughout. Duncan has something witty or random to say for just about every object or character you come across.\n\nSo far the story moves along nicely and keeps me wanting to find out what Duncan will remember next. The battle mechanics are a throwback to the old Final Fantasy system - not overly complicated and easy to use. I enjoy that. I find the battle difficulty strikes a good balance. It can be challenging, but never ridiculous and so far I haven't been subjected to any prolonged amount of leveling-up just to clear a dungeon of boss.\n\nThe graphics are great - exactly what I'd expect for a 16-bit era game. The soundtrack is phenomenal and catchy. Just like an FF game, it beautifully sets the tone for the all places you visit. Play controls can be with the mouse or keyboard. Overall, I'm very happy with it - excuse me, gotta play some more!","August 23, 2015","true","6.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
