Its very similar to PokerStars program.\nIts a little even better than poker stars cuz it has beter disigne, but thats it.\n\nBigest problem is what you cant withdraw your money but you can deposit... Well this is stupid and i dont like it... If you are gambling you are risking to get money and to lose, but not to win for nothing and to lose for wining... What?!\nSo its another P2W game ? Its not even real gambling cuz you cant withdraw your money... I would like to withdraw my money (chips) to steam wallet and that would be very intresting to play.\n\nOr to play with iteams to risk to lose them and to get some money and ect... Well thats what im calling gambling.\n\nI hope it will get withdraw option later...

Scheinberg, 10 Cr. 336 (2011), is a United States federal criminal case against the founders of the three largest online poker companies, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Cereus (Absolute Poker/Ultimatebet), and a handful of their associates,[1] which alleges that the defendants violated the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) and engaged in bank fraud and money laundering to process transfers to and from their customers.[1] A companion civil case, United States v. PokerStars, et al., 11 Civ. 2564 (2011),[2] includes Full Tilt and Cereus as defendants and seeks the recovery of forfeiture equaling approximately $3 billion in assets belonging to the companies.\nYes, that's right, the devs of this game are literally criminals.\n\nThey were forbidden from having real money pay.

You get 1000 playmoney and you can get 1000 more when it's gone for free. If you want to play higher playmoney stakes you have 2 options:\n1 - Grind it up with your 1000 starting bankroll\n2 - Buy playmoney chips.\n\nBut why would anyone buy playmoney chips for real money? Or why would you wanna play with playmoney? Here is my advice:\nJust start playing with real money! You can sit at a realmoney table for as low as $ 0,80 at the 1 and 2 cent blind tables. Realmoney tables also plays a whole lot different than playmoney tables, it's almost uncomparible. If you wanna learn to play poker better do it at a real money table.\n\nThere are many poker affiliate sites (just google) that will give a small bankroll for free. That way you can learn poker on realmoney tables without actually risking anything ! If you lose it all, it doesn't matter, cause you didn't spend any money. And if you are good enough to be winning, than you have found a new profitable hobby.\n\nSo, pay to play playmoney poker or get free money and play real poker?\n\nI'm wondering how much money steam got from FTP to put this in the store.","January 27","false","0.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Some other people crying about that the site is owned by scamers like Howard Lederer and Chris Ferguson. That's not the truth. Pokerstars bought and reopened Full Tilt and all players who got scamed by the old owners got there bankroll back. So please, don't spread lies around.

You can choose from a few dozen avatars, from police officers to ordinary people to...frogs? Okay sure.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough if you know how to play Poker. But keep in mind one thing; this does end up being gambling after all. Is it free to play? Absolutely. But if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me who doesn't know when you stop playing, you end up losing all the free chips you start with, and then you need to pay real $$$ to get more.\n\nOf course the prices for the chips aren't too bad; just $2.00 would get you 200K, $5 would get you 600K, and $10 actually gets you 1.5 million. There are higher amounts of course but a smart person wouldn't pay any higher then $10.00 for an in-game purchase, regardless of what game it is. But if you wanna get like 100 million chips, and you have $125 laying around that you aren't going to use, by all means go ahead.\n\nAnyway, this is a decent poker client and if you wanna give it a go, you don't really have any reason not to do so.\n\n10/10 would lose all my chips in 25 minutes again. -_-","January 26","true","0.4"," 29 of 127 people (23%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","23","29","127","11","13"
