The dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped, also constantly putting out strawpolls to the community and listens to us.\n\nUnturned is played how you want, example, if you only want PVE you can select your server and if you want a PVP experience with your PVE you can select PVP enabled on your server, and yes, you can host your own servers on your computer.\n\nIt starts out like many other apocalypse survival games: you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory. You have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn, like a cabin camp, small town, military base, and many more. Your main mission when you start is to grab a melee, some food with drink, and a backpack. Once you've acquired these necessities, you may wish to find a gun if you want to PVP, or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm, or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the night.\n\nThe PVP system is great also, server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server (best for PVP) or not be able to bring loot in (Best for PVE Immersion). Their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also. You can also SHOOT OUT OF CARS (but not from the drivers seat of course)! Load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly drive-by if you wish!\n\nThe towns are well structured for PVP also, their are lot of CQC battles to be fought, and also small hills for sniping, but snipers can be easily flanked if you don't post up right!\n\nBase raiding is also important in PVP too. People on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits, plenty of windows, and escape routes! You must observe a player's base and attack it strategically, you never know how many players may be in there!\n\nNow, time to farm my crops and build my base, I recommend you do so also!\n\nSteam group link for clan: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheMicBrothers","June 16, 2014","true","69.1"," 3,225 of 3,657 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","225","3","0","149"

With a variety of weapons and attachments at your disposal, you can hunt down animals, zombies, and other players.\n\n(Weapon Segment)\n\nThe fact that every attachment is compatable with every weapon, as long as it has the slot for it (Barrel, Tactical, Sight, ect.), Makes choosing your weapon fun. You have yourself an Outfield? Put a Silencer, Bipod, and a x12 Scope on it and you have an effective silenced sniper. Don't have a x12 Scope, Silencer, or Bipod? Take 2 duct tape and craft it with binoculars. Then take 2 empty cans and 2 cans of Cola and craft them with fire from a Campfire. Finally, find a Tactical Laser. All these will make a Zoomomatic (Scope that is better than the x6, but no reticle), a Muffler (Silent shooting, but muzzle flash still active), and the Tactical laser acts as a reticle for the Zoomomatic. It's the small things like this that I love in survival games. Being able to create a makeshift sniper using little Millitary grade equipment is just one example of the combinations of weapons and attachments.\n\n(Survival Segment)\n\nThe surviving aspect is also amazing. Hunger, Thirst, and Illness are what keep you alive. Unlike most games, they go up as you get hungry, thirsty, and sick (At least in the games I've played, they go down). Make sure to Keep them down by eating food and drinking any drink. Illness can be gained from multiple sources, such as getting hit by zombies and eating raw/rotten foods and drinks. Illness can only be brought down with Vitamins, Anti-biotics, and a type of berry and it's crushed counterpart. You can go from town to town scavenging food and drinks, or you can take to the hills in search of wildlife to hunt. Grab a fire axe, handsaw, and pickaxe to start building a base in the hills, or fortify the roof of a building. Build traps for zombies and players alike. Light up an area with generators and worklights.\n\n(Experience Segment)\n\nAs you hunt animals, kill zombies, collect wood, and mine rocks, you will tend to notice a notification at the top of your screen informing you that you have gained som experience. At the start of Unturned, you are very vulnurable, But fear not. Pressing the button you have bound to open up inventory (Default is Tab) will reveal....your inventory. At the bottom you will see three tabs labeled Apperal, Crafting, and Skills. Selecting Skills will replace your character at the right with many options. The top shows your current experience and the red bars show the ammount of levels it can be upgraded by (Red being levels not yet achieved and Green being current level). For starters, you should focus on upgrading Survival (Slower thirst and hunger gained) and Immunity (Heal more effectivly and less Illness gained from zombie hits and raw/rotten foods). After that, you can decide if you want to upgrade Stamina to outrun the zombies or Warrior to fight back. Build more structures and traps with Crafting. Sneak around zombies and towards wildlife with Sneakybeaky. Take the shot with little recoil thanks to Marksman. Chop and mine faster with Outdoors. These Skills make surviving easier, just make sure to keep an eye on the Hunger and Thirst bar.\n\nIn summary, this game as a fantastic weapon system, challenging survival, and rewarding skills. 10/10 for both the game and this being my longest review ever.","July 2, 2014","true","243.2"," 2,009 of 2,298 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","009","2","0","60"

The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a "Blam" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing.\n\nTL;DR: Play the game, don't play on severs with admins.","June 13, 2015","true","166.9"," 466 of 504 people (92%) found this review helpful 92 people found this review funny","92","466","504","92","26"

One of my personal stories from this game was getting onto a server with 24 other people on it. I spawn near the airbase on PEI and see about 3 other people geared to hell and back. I find a golf club and wait for one of the lesser members to stray from the herd and that is when I strike. He starts to yell back to his team but they can't hear him. I quickly get in his way so he can't run and I strike him down in the heart of battle. I got shot 2 times but it was worth it. I stole his gear and quickly disguised as him and came back toward his team. I get back to them and they ask where I was. I stay silent and they are asking if my mic works or not. I press down my mic button and mumble into my headset which gives them the information they need to believe me. Soon after we get into a car and I'm in the back seat. The person I killed says he was killed in world chat which confuses his teammates. I was in the back of the truck so I had a clear view of the 2 other people who were in the front seat. Taking out the 3rd members gun I quickly shot them both in the head as they were talking to each other about the situation. I then got in the front seat, stopped the car and looted both of the other "teammates". I then finished off everyone else in the server and promptly left so I was not hunted down mercilessly.","December 23, 2015","true","77.9"," 444 of 493 people (90%) found this review helpful 437 people found this review funny","90","444","493","437","20"

What is Unturned, you may be asking? Well, it's an indie zombie survival game, packed with plenty of features. Let me run through them.\n\nLooting, Inventory, and Crafting\nSo, Unturned has a fairly in-depth looting and inventory system.\n\n- Items have physics, so if you, for example, drop a log down a hill, it will roll down. Apart from that, there are various locations where you can gather loot, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, barracks, on ships, in containers, and more.\n\n-  The inventory system is very in depth, each piece of clothing you equip will give you more inventory slots to carry more items. There is also different pieces of armour that protect from damage inflicted by bullets.\n\n-  As for the crafting, when you get different items, you can combine them to create makeshift weapons, vaccines, barricades, and even vehicles.\n\nMaps and serverlist\n- In Unturned, there are 3 different official maps: PEI, Washington, and Yukon. Washington is a purely PVP map, Yukon is a purely Survival map, and PEI is somewhere inbetween.\n\n- The Serverlist is a huge improvement, instead of connecting via IP, now there is a list which you can browse and filter out difficulty, security (VAC-secured/Non-VAC-secured), first/thirdperson, and Workshop, which brings me onto my next point.\n\n\nWorkshop mods and map editor\n- Yup, Unturned has Workshop Mods, which allows people to upload new vehicles, maps, and weapons, for others to download and try out.\n\n- Map Editor: Yes, this is also a thing. It's used to create maps to upload to the workshop, and you can place objects, transform terrain, put player and item spawns, etc. Pretty useful, but baking materials requires a pretty beefy PC (or otherwise a couple-minute-wait)\n\n\nWeapons and Vehicles.\nIn Unturned, there are a variety of weapons and vehicles.\n\n- There are 4 Assault Rifles, 4 Carbines, 3 Shotguns, 2 LMGs, 6 pistols, 1 Railgun, 1 Rocket Launcher, 1 Nailgun, 5 bows, 3 sniper rifles, 2 sharpshooter rifles, and 6 civilian rifles.\n\n- As for vehicles, there are golf carts, vans, sedans, hatchbacks, trucks, roadsters, quad bikes, snow mobiles, tractors, taxis, buses, snow explorers, ambulances, police cars, fire trucks, Urals (tan and forest), APCs (amphibious, tan and forest), Humvees (tan and forest), Jeeps (tan and forest), racecars, and 3 different types of makeshift vehicles (1 seater, 4 seater, 6 seater)\n\n- There are also two planes (one sea-plane, one normal), four helicopters (Skycrane type helicopter, a Police helicopter, a Hummingbird, and a Huey in tan and forest.), and three boats (jetskis, a speedboat, and police boat.)\n\n\nWeapon skins and cosmetics\nSo there are also weapon skins and cosmetics, cosmetics being applied to your character and changing the look, and weapon skins change the look of your gun, ranging from camo skins to glowing, luminescent skins that sell for dozens of dollars.\n\n\nBuildables\nIn Unturned, you can build entire bases, or just barricade up a pre-existing house. Freeform buildables allow you to angle walls, barricades, traps, etc, and also allow you to attach them to cars, turning that crappy old Sedan into a tank using metal sheets and barbed wire, or putting crates in a helicopter to transport gear around.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThat just about wraps up my Unturned review. Thanks for reading this far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's drinkable maple syrup. 10/10.","February 13","true","696.8"," 264 of 284 people (93%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","93","264","284","69","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/recommended/304930/","dsp21","[J7] Dsp21","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/","350 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEasily one of the best free to play games on Steam. This is a genre that has been over-done, but Unturned manages to be unique in it's own way. Kill zombies, gather resources, hunt animals, craft things and scavenge for items. That's all you do.\n\nYou only have 3 types of enemies in Unturned, there's the normal, the military and the Mega zombies, the latter being quite rare and way more powerful which will make you want to run if you encounter one, especially if you're playing on Hard, but Unturned is more about the quantity of enemies... if you get swarmed, you're gonna have a bad time!\n\nThe beauty in Unturned stands in how simple it is, yet manages to be fun and quite graphically stunning. The developer team is just one single developer, and he's about 17 years old, that is something that should always be remembered, because not only does he update the game on a regular basis (about twice a week now), he has improved this game from an almost unplayable mess for older computers which was v2.0, to a polished and really smooth game v3.0 is.\n\nI still haven't bought the Gold Upgrade, but I'm planning on doing it, just because I want to "donate" to Nelson Saxton, this is how Free to Play should be. There's no "BUY HP FOR 5$", the game is COMPLETELY free, and all you get from the golden upgrade is cosmetic stuff, like new facial expressions, skin coloring and access to the Gold servers, which are restricted to "Premium" members (great for when you want to avoid F2P newbies). Again, there is more content but it's not shoved in your face 24/7, and it doesn't really make you a superior, more well-equipped player for owning it.\n\nThere's a set of skills where you use the experience you gather from killing zombies, hunting animals and harvesting resources, these skills are all very helpful to your survival, and will take their time to be fully upgraded. For now there's the Offense, Defense, and Support skills, maybe we'll see more in the future :)\n\nThere are numerous items in this game and for the looks of it, new items are still being added in each update. Weapons go from Hockey Sticks and Golf clubs, to Sniper Rifles, Machine Guns and more. You can find some vehicles too with a Fuel system, which means you can't go everywhere with your car without scavenging for fuel first. There's also tons of food around, but good luck on finding it in good condition, because Unturned also uses an item quality system. You can eat a carrot, but if it's moldy, your illness  percentage will increase and you'll end up scavenging for pills in order to cure it.\n\nDo you remember how satisfying it felt in Resident Evil 4, when you had your inventory all organized and in place? Unturned now has the same type of inventory in v3.0, which is way more realistic than the inventory in v2.0. An item takes X number of squares depending on it's size. Oh, and you can choose 2 of these items for quick switching with the 1 and 2 keys, you'll probably put your weapon/tool here, since a zombie always appears out of the blue!\n\nThere's not much more to say about Unturned, it's a great game where you and your friends can spend lots of hours just creating a house and equipping it, or just scavenging and exploring Prince Edward Island to find all the secrets that lies within it. Unturned is a must play to anyone who has a Steam account, even if it is for just 1 hour, it will be enough to see the effort of a young developer which I undoubtedly respect. I'm not saying it's the best game ever, I even admit it can be a bit boring after some time (for me), but for the price of 0$, it's an awesome game, and I'm pretty sure I'll play it in the future to check out the updates.\n\nScore: 8/10","April 30, 2015","true","74.3"," 217 of 227 people (96%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","96","217","227","16","11"

I think whenever I try to describe it to my friends, I compare it to like a Minecraft with guns, without as much crafting. It's a survival, apocolyptic style game. You can either go single player and test yourself alone, or you can join servers where you can either team up, gain trusts of other groups and join them, create a survival team, or get killed on sight by Bandits or be a bandit. You will roam town to town searching for food and drinks that hopefully are edible and nonspoiled. Zombies will be infested in every town. So look carefully for that assault rifle or military knife to fend yourself against them. HAHA if only! Until then, you will have a higher chance of using rakes, butcher knives and baseball bats. Still not happy with it? Find some nails, rope and glue and make a makeshift bat that has nails in it. Find axes in the fire station or find some luck in the police headquarters and get yourself a Colt .45 and a bulletproof vest. You're gonna want to make a move, so find a gas tank and a car or walk. Don't feel like doing either? Cut down some trees with your axe and start crafting. Feeling lonely? This game supports singleplayer and multiplayer. You can join vanilla servers on the regular PEI map or you can join servers that have mods with commands and airdrops, where weapons spawn in different towns every 10 minutes and people fight for the loot almost like the Hunger Games.","June 18, 2015","true","114.7"," 320 of 356 people (90%) found this review helpful 386 people found this review funny","90","320","356","386","23"

This game is a free-to-play steam game, so obviously anyone can really play this. That being said, unturned is a zombie survival game which requires you to gather weapons, food, water, and other resources to stay alive. So far there are 3 (official) maps implimented into the game. It's possible to download more along with other weapons and items from the community workshop. You can play this game by yourself, with friends, or just join a multiplayer server. The game offers PVP and PVE game types. The game offers 3 difficulty types: easy, normal, and hard. If you do play this game and decide you like it, you can always purchase the "Permanent Gold Upgrade" for $4.99 which gives you a few gold items for your character. The money goes to Nelson Sexton, the creator of Unturned. Anyway with that review being said, let's list the pro's and con's!\n\nPro's:\n-Free-to-play (unless you decide to support Nelson buy purchasing the gold upgrade)\n-Fun to play for any age group\n-Ability to play on a private server with friends (using hamachi)\n-Crafting system\n-Level up/skills system\n-Free form building and the ability to create your own base\n-Many different weapons and items\n-Huge maps that offer a lot of stuff to do\n\nCon's:\n-The community on servers is cancer. They're basically a 10 year old version of DayZ or H1Z1 players.\n-The hit range can sometimes be a bother. Seems like zombies can hit you a lot farther away than you can hit them.\n-The night cycle seems rather long.\n\nAnyway that's my review, I hope it helped.","November 27, 2015","true","77.9"," 236 of 253 people (93%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","93","236","253","22","5"

With Unturned this isn't the case.\n\nThe game is a completely free to play zombie survival game, there is an option to pay to upgrade this to a Gold membership however this is purely for aesthetic purposes - Newer/slick UI, extra character model customisations, Gold username displays on the in-game chat, you can also gain access to gold-member-only servers with a few % bonuses like exp and loot but this is a level playing field as you can only play with other Gold members with these bonuses.\n\nI don't wish to give much away about the gameplay but the game is awesome to play with friends and you can set up your own private servers fairly easily.\n\nThere are a few bits and pieces that I feel could and most-likely will be improved in the near future:\n(There is currently a huge overhaul in development to the game so these points may/may not be valid once the update is live)\n\nThe crafting system has pretty much zero guidance, and the recipes aren't exactly obvious. I don't like being spoon-fed but Stick + Bolts = Torch didn't occur naturally to me. The wiki contains everything you need to know about crafting.\n(Only in Player vs Environment) Once you have fortified, armed/equipped yourself, and have a steady income of growing crops the game becomes a lot less challenging - although I still manage to die in the simplest of situations... I would love to see roaming hordes on this game.\nAt present the game only has one map, although the developer (The one developer working on this title) is in the process of creating a new Canada map.\nHackers are a bit of a nuisance in online PvP servers.\nThe above notes are just from my own personal take and experience of the game so far.\n\nThese aside, I love the simple, blocky graphics, the open world feel, the insatiable appetite of your character - same goes for the zombies, the weapons and attachments, the survival mechanics, the trust issues, the uneasy silences, the countless naked respawns etc etc.\n\nI would really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys surviving with friends.","January 22, 2015","true","121.6"," 206 of 219 people (94%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","94","206","219","19","3"

The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a "Blam" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing.\n\n\n","July 3, 2015","true","153.9"," 289 of 329 people (88%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","88","289","329","52","23"

Irradiation is the hardest to take care of once you progress. If you get into battles with hoardes of zombies, you can easily die due to radiation sickness.\n\nHealth is also pretty dificult to take care of, but not nearly as much. You can heal from eating, using medkits, and a few other actions. Hunger and thirst are the easiest to take care of. You can find canteens, and fill them with ocean water to avoid having to find bottled water or soda. You can also grow crops, and cultivate a farm at a location of your choice.  A few tips I can give are:\n\nSet up a base away from zombies or towns, they can attack and destroy crops, and bases.\n\nBe sure to NEVER provoke zombies once you first start with no weapon, unless you are an older player.\n\nAlso, make sure that the first thing you do is raid a farmhouse, you can find arrows, bows, guns, axes, bats, chainsaws, etc.\n\nYou will sometimes find what I like to call the "Hulk"\nIt is a zombie that is larger than normal, and does alot of damage. If you try to fight him, be sure to kite him, or just shoot him.\n\nIf you don't know what kiting is, it is when you allow the enemy to attack, and when he is done attacking, stab him, then quickly run back before he hits you. Just do that continuously to kill him.\n\nThe "Hulk" can drop a variety of military grade weapons. You may find that the most prominent of all is the "Dragonfang"\n\nThe Dragonfang is an LMG, with a magazine size of 100. Also, there is crafting in this game, which is much too complicated to get into on a post, but i can say that you can repair weapons, craft barricades, walls, doors, roofing, gun attachments, apparel, bandages, and many other things.\n\nAlso, be sure to check out the airport or military base when you get very good gear.\n\nIf you find any of what i said intrigueing, then by any means necessary, get this game.","July 21, 2015","true","94.1"," 212 of 232 people (91%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","91","212","232","26","12"

The next morning I got super lucky and found a rucksack in one of the towers, I then killed the zombies that had spawned there and proceeded to loot. When I got to the tables near the shooting range I found a ghilli suit, next to it was a timberwolf (sniper rifle) and to be honest I was a little too over excited about this. I continued to loot for continues days.\n\nA good friend of mine got this game about a week and a half after and I gave him the server info. Hours passed and he got geared up too. We drove around in the vehicles that we'd collect like nothing could kill us, I eventually built a base for us right next to the military complex (mind that we'd never explored the right half of the map). On day my friend and I had decided to go on a "vacation" and go to the airport on the exact other side of the map. Once we arrived at the airport we looted and found a katana, my friend decided that I should keep it, so I did. We had finished looting and started to drive back to our base and my friend went to go make himself dinner, took the wheel and started to drive home.\n\nAs we passed through a town I noticed that the gas tank was nearly empty, so I parked the car behind a gas station and killed the zombies that where near the car as I got out of the car, I accidentally honked the horn. As I was filling up the gas can I started to see smoke coming from the back of the gas station. I rushed back to the car to see a horde of zombies that was attacking the car that had caught on fire. I pulled out my katana and killed about four zombies and my headset roared, my screen instantly turned bright grey. All the zombies where lying dead on the floor, along with my friend.\n\nAs my friend got back he screamed at me and I was just cracking up.\nYou should get this game, it’s amazing\n5/5 exploding cars with afk people inside.\n20/20 zombies.\n1/1 screaming people\n\n\n","December 27, 2014","true","80.5"," 203 of 221 people (92%) found this review helpful 133 people found this review funny","92","203","221","133","12"

I told him I was at a farm. He said which one. I said I didn't know which one. He then started to be a little sh*y and demand that I "submit" to him and give him everything that I had.

(imo)\n\n- Gameplay, the biggest change in gameplay is the balance and additions to the skill system which are good. Still lacking as I think there's great potential for perks for skills.\n\n- Gunplay, the gunplay in this game is a lot better since the recoil feels really good and the amount of modifications for the guns is a really good size.\n\n- Multiplayer, wow has the multiplayer in this game gotten good, no longer do you have to search up tutorials on how to join servers and try to find servers that still even run. You just open up a server list and you can search for the most players, best ping, easy or normal games, or just join any server you see, your choice.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties including easy normal hard and premium, although most are normal with stupid plugins and rules such as starterkits and no KOS.\n\n- Graphics, nelson changed the game to a newer version so that came along with better lighting, reflections and better particles.\n\n- Vehicles, holy ♥♥♥♥ they are way better, funny how an 18 year old dev can create better driving than overkill software (creators of payday 2).\n\n- Performance, it performs statistically a lot better since he updated the game to a newer version of the engine he uses. I doubt you'll run this game bad though.\n\n|x| Thanks for reading my review, If you have anything to ask me or want me to add, shoot a comment on this review. |x|\n\nTL;DR : Game has improved a lot over the course of a year and he's planning more like a new map set in america and a bunch of weapons.","September 11, 2015","true","50.9"," 159 of 167 people (95%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","95","159","167","20","6"

Not on my server you don't. I jump into my cruiser, my mate in tow with a full auto eaglefire (military rifle) in the back seat, we're doing 75 KM/H to the farms, sirens blaring, and as we get closer, my mate shouts over the voice chat, "Bandits at six-o-clock, they're firing!", So I give the order to open fire! *BANG, BANG BANG BANG BANG!* as the shots ring out. We're barrelling down the main road, going through clip after clip of ammo emptying shots into this black pickup truck as they follow close behind. I dive left, I dive right! *BANG* as they shoot with a hunting rifle into my cruiser. Then all of a sudden, my mate is hit square in the head by a lucky shot and he goes down! So now, with no ability to shoot back, all I can do is flee! I'm racing to get back to the safety of the peacekeeper compound, when I hit a tree out of no where! I throw the cruiser into reverse and floor it, smashing into the bandits as they're firing with pistols into my cruiser as it begins to smoke under the pressure. I throw it into drive and begin off again. When they finally get a lucky shot and my cruiser bursts into flames! I dive out, draw my revolver and fire three carefully placed shots into the pickup. *BANG... BANG... BANG...* as my shots ring out. I hit the driver of the pickup once injuring him, they get out and draw rifles to end this. *Not today!*. I fire two more quick shots, *BANG BANG!*, and they're franctically firing rifles at me when one bullet strikes the cruiser, causing it to explode!

Well let me just say, your wrong. This is the best game I have played with friends. It is basicaly a free (totally amazing) version of dayZ. The map is huge and the 3.0 version is so much better. here is a story of what happened when I first got the game.\n\nI woke up stranded on a island with nothing at all. I found some pants and a Tshirt and set off. I searched and searched for a while untill I found a Glock stashed under a bed, and some food in the kitchen. I set off. I killed zombies as I went and eventually found another player. I thought he was friendly but it ended up otherwise. he pulled a revolver on me and said to hand over my stuff. I figured I had to move fast. I punched the guy in the face which he didn't expect and I ran behind a car. I checked my Glock, which only had two bullets. I knew I had to get at least two head-shots. I jumped on the car and shot and heard a load bang coming from his direction. I looked down and I was hit right on my Tshirt but I had jerked the trigger when I shot and hit him in the foot. I thought I was a dead man when suddenly I heard a siren. I looked at the road and saw a police speeding down the road. When he got out he said to drop our weapons, which I did without further promting. The robber on the other hand was quick to shoot at the officer. The cop ran behind his car and I knew it was all over when I saw him pull from his pack a MapleStrike with a 7x scope and silencer. Even though I knew he wasn't aiming at me I still hit the floor. When it was all over the police brought me to headquarters and checked me over. Once I was all fixed up he let me go with an extra revolver.\n\nHope this was helpful I rate this game a 10/10","March 22, 2015","true","29.3"," 299 of 360 people (83%) found this review helpful 139 people found this review funny","83","299","360","139","37"

It's developed by a 17 year old Canadian who is connected to the community and committed to updating/patching regularly.  The game, while still in development, has a lot going for it.  There's a lot of items, a good crafting system, skills to boost, and a survival system.\n\nMy complaints so far are the zombies are too slow and easy to kill and the map itself is rather small.  I would also like to see some custom server options to address these issues.  Also this game doesn't seem like it would be much fun single player.  The human element really adds to survival games like this.\n\nI do like what I see and so I bought the DLC to throw some money to the dev for his fun, free game.  I consider it an investment for further growth.\n\nSo do I recommend it?  Yes.  Grabs some friends and try it out.  It's free so you have nothing to lose.  Then keep your eye on the development and we will see where this goes.  Who knows maybe I'll see you out there.  You'll know it's me when you see a guy wearing nothing but a chef's hat, and is tripping out of his mind, and clenching a sledgehammer menacingly.  You know what?  You might want to go the other direction.  He's weird.","October 12, 2014","true","15.0"," 157 of 176 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","157","176","0","16"

The graphics are not the fanciest that can be found out there, but it's because of the pure and unique style this game has. A moderately complicated crafting system is also present. If you like survival MMOs, this game is for you. There's also a singleplayer mode for a more peaceful experience.\n\n1. The Actual Review\n\nWhen I downloaded this game, I wasn't really expecting much, especially because my brother recommended it and most of games he likes, I don't. But it was a huge blast when I noticed how complex and how challenging this game actually is, especially in multiplayer modes. You can carry both a primary and secondary weapon (in the beta version 3.0, which is way better than 2.5), which are basically a rifle/shotgun/assault rifle as a primary and a melee/pistol as a secondary weapon. You can also find clothes, helmets, backpacks, food, water, and did I say HELMETS?! and many more items that will help you to survive longer by providing more space to carry more items, healing and protection.\n\n2. Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n- Huge sandbox experience;\n- Decent amount of items;\n- Difficult to survive when you are not experienced;\n- In multiplayer, you will actually do anything not do die because the death penalty is high (this can be a con for some, but I really love games where you are actually afraid of dying);\n- The dev takes good care of the game and updates frequently with new content and fixes (about 3 times a week);\n- Good crafting system;\n- You can create your own maps;\n\n\nCons\n- The community is generally friendly but can be annoying depending on the server you join;\n- Singleplayer gets very easy and boring after some time;\n- The beta branch of the game sometimes experience a few game-breaking glitches that are, most of times, solved quickly.\n\n\n3. Personal Experiences\n\n>Second day playing multiplayer, naked, because I died in the previous day;\n>Some guys who like to play as cops at stratford point guns at me complaining I'm commiting a crime by walking naked;\n>I get a death penalty\n>A mysterious sniper takes down the tree guys from a distance and I leave the place alive\n>Mysterious sniper turns out to be a guy with a farmer's hat and military gear\n>He gives me some food, water and orders me to carry a few things for him\n>Minutes later, after helping him out a bit, I find a swiss knife and hide it from the mysterious sniper\n>Fearing he will kill me after I have a considerable amount of stuff, but no weapons and that he's using me as a packmule, I backstab him in the head\n>get all his gear and he comes at me, naked and carrying a rifle a few minutes later\n>Rek him again\n\n10/10 would rek the mysterious sniper again\n\n\n>After one week and recently dying, I have a supressed sniper and a few things;\n>I see a group of 3 full-geared guys with nightvisions and rare military weapons;\n>I take one out with a headshot and the others try to hind behind a tree, but they're still in my line of sight;\n>I take the other two guys out and start being called aimbot by the whole group\n>They start to say in the world chat where they died\n>as I'm taking their gear, a guy that barely has clothes hits me with a sledgehammer in the head twice and I die\n>I respawn and go desperately try to retrieve my stuff\n>Give up when I notice there's about 15 players fighting for the loot with snipers, grenades and assault rifles\n\n10/10 would start a war again\n\n\nThere were many other epic moments that I wish I could tell, but my review will get too long! Do get the game if you like this genre and don't get very mad when you die!","May 24, 2015","true","562.1"," 136 of 148 people (92%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","92","136","148","58","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/browncoffeedude/recommended/304930/","browncoffeedude","TheCoffeeDude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/browncoffeedude/","18 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnturned is a very easy game to judge at first glance. It doesn't appear to have amazing graphics, it has a Roblox-looking vibe, and there are noobs everywhere. Well, some of this IS true, but this is one of those games that you have to submerge yourself in a little before the true beauty shows. It can be seen as a game where you wander around chugging glue and getting high in order to stay alive a little longer...or it can be seen as a challenging survival experience where strategy is key. With full release said to be coming soon, let's see what early access is like in Unturned.\n\nUnturned is a zombie apocalypse game where you must wander around as a human survivor to collect food, water, keep warm, and avoid zombies to stay alive as long as possible. You can find a plane if you want and go on a joy ride, then maybe you can start building a giant base, storing your prized finds from your adventures. After a few weeks of playing singleplayer, you've done everything. So why not check out multiplayer? There's plenty more to see and experience in this game.\n\nLet's talk about the look, since that's one of the main things we focus on.  The graphics have no crazy detail whatsoever, but that's not the point. The graphics are focused: You see what you need to see. You'll soon find that the models actually look quite pleasing in their basic and rounded look.\n\nAlright what about the survival experience? It can be very challenging in its own unique way.  You need to keep finding fresh food and water to stay alive, and you'll have to strategize and plan where you will go to satisfy your stomach. There is a temperature mechanic, where you will have to take cover in shelter during the cold and dress up to stay warm. It can be difficult to create a sustainable food source outside of towns. In short, the survival aspects in this game always keep you moving around the map like a nomad. You can settle down in one place...but not long before you have to make another run to Big J's Diner for some grub.\n\nLet's talk PvP...a big aspect to this game. If you thought shooting zombies with a high caliber DragonFang is fun, try shooting at some other players in multiplayer. The gun mechanics are satisfying: You have your standard recoil, your aiming, but where this system really shines is the customization. This ranges from increasing accuracy with a barrel attachment, or alleviating recoil with a nice grip. The melee is pretty great too. With left-click, you get the standard attack for that given weapon. With right-click, and the sacrifice of a little enegery and a longer attack time, you can strike a heavy, hammering attack on both zombies, and players. The aspects put together are very easy to understand, and creates several opportunities for players to have their own technique.\n\nHere are my PROS and CONS.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Great in it's simplicity | It's a very simple looking game, and that makes it special.\n-Amazing PvP mechanics | The PvP in this game is very nice and customizable. Well balanced.\n-No pay-to-win! | You can buy a Gold upgrade, and gun skins, but never any advantage-granting things.\n-Player and UI (User Interface) customizability | Tune your looks to fit your style.\n-Ties in with Steam groups | Make a Steam group for your Unturned team, it ties into multiplayer.\n-Absolutely free (as of now) | Unturned is 100% free to play (this may change at full release...)!\n-Easy to use map maker | The game features a great way for players to make their own maps.\n-Steam Workshop capabilities | Design mods, skins, and more with the Steam Workshop!\n\nCONS:\n\n-Limited singleplayer goals | There's not too many goals to keep players on singleplayer.\n-A somewhat ugly home sceen | The main screen on start-up is very cluttered with text.\n\n\nI thought, since this review unexpectedly gained popularity, that I would take advantage of this situation to direct Nelson's attention to some things the community, and I, would like to see before full release. These have been gathered from both me, and comments I've seen from the comminity (Feel free to suggest more things in a reply to this review, I will add them if they seem fit for the game.)\n\n-The return of the original Canada map, restored and re-balanced of course. :)\n-Add some more goals to singleplayer, it gets old after everything is acomplished.\n-More planes. Some variety might be nice, maybe some dedicated for war, and one for transport.\n-Add another map. The official maps that we have as of now, feel rather limited, more would be lovely!\n-Add an electrical system to the game. This could include ways to generate electricity, store it (to a certain extent), power other electric-requiring things (this could include car batteries).\n-A way to see your Steam friends' name tags and location on the map, and in the world. This will work like the groups system, and can be disabled when the player is set up as anonymous.\n\nThank you so much for your efforts and time, Nelson!","March 23","true","251.6"," 140 of 154 people (91%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","91","140","154","21","7"

The graphics are pretty basic, smooth flat coloured surfaces and blocky character models... but I like them a lot. I think the graphics, more than simple, are just plain charming. I love the silly character customization too. And who doesn't want to be able to survive in the apocalypse with their friends? Multiplayer for games like these is necessary, and I'm glad Unturned supports multiplayer gameplay.\n\nI've heard a lot of people complaining that the beginning is too hard, but honestly as soon as I found a melee weapon I felt pretty set. If anything, I think the gameplay is too easy as it is right now. (This is before the big 3.0 update that is currently in developement) Once I established a base to store things in my character just stopped dying haha. Crafting is confusing and unintuitive though and I felt like it really took too many resources. (But maybe that's just me) the update is fixing that though with a built in crafting menu that gives you recipes based on the resources you have in your inventory. (As far as I can tell)\nOnce the newest version is released it will have a custom map maker as well! It's fairly easy to use once you've tinkered with it a little bit. I've already seen some amazing content from the community!\n\nAnyway, If you're looking for something different from minecraft and dayz, look elsewhere.\nBut if you want a fun and simple survival game with lots of respawning zombies to headshot and constant content and gameplay updates, try it out. Why not? It's free! It also has some great PvP potential! (Hiding in fields, wearing camoflauge to sneak up on people, using things like trees, bushes, buildings to stealth with, etc)\nAlso, the game is being overhauled and so far the beta of the newest version really is adding a lot of improvements! I can't wait to see where this game goes!\n\nBefore I finish I'm going to say that the developer (Nelson Sexton) really puts a lot of hard work into this game. He listens to the community well and updates more than the other early access games I'm keeping my eyes on. I really apreciate how much time and effort he manages to put into Unturned.\n\nI recommend buying gold if you like this game! The bonuses are worth the $5. (In my humble opinion)","December 8, 2014","true","67.4"," 143 of 160 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","143","160","0","7"

Children flock to block-based games and anything that cheap, unfunny, and fake youtubers say a damn thing about. I am tired of it. On the other hand, I am happy to say that I am actively reading comments and making any neccessary changes to the review. Please check back every so often!\n\nAnd don't even mention the ♥♥♥♥ing crate unboxing garbage.\n\nUnturned:This is a brilliant game that was born on a browser game made for children called ROBLOX. Some of the games on there were actually fun, such as the prototype of this game, and that is why I played it. That prototype eventually became this game that kept getting better. It is now in the 3rd stage of it's early access (Also called 3.0), and it is doing extremely well with a fully fledged workshop and excellent map editor.\n\nProblem: This game, however, has the same problem ROBLOX did on all competitive modes: The damned community. You will constantly be shot or punched by random childish fresh spawns because they have nothing to lose. It's apparently funny for a few minutes? And fully geared people, mature or not, shoot on sight to avoid losing their hard work to people like this. Eventually it becomes a massive clusterf*ck; you have idiots with no gear or a gun with 20 bullets running around just to kill, and then fully geared people going on a sniping spree, some of which are forced to. Seemingly the childish community came here because they like Minecraft or watch PewDiePie. PewDiePie, like any other sh*tty spoiled youtuber, acts like a tard to make a profit and attracts so many children that flood any game that he reviews. Then comes the minecraft part. Is everything that has blocks or pixel graphics automatically minecraft? No. Why does any game that have those attract minecraft audiences? Because the children can't tell the difference. I mean, come on, this game doesn't even abide by a grid. Nelson seems to like it because it makes his game popular and everyone worships him. Children will bow down to a snail. I would rather have noone playing my game at all than to have this.\n\nSolution: The only solution it seems is to play with your friends on a private server. Playing with your friends is fun. Those custom servers that ban KOS are great, too, but the problem with those is that they can often be very strict and/or ran by children, so you might get banned from them with little warning. There are also usually white-list requirements to get on, which nobody likes to go through. And another caution: No KOS/Roleplay servers also tend to allow 'hold ups.' If you ever played Arma, you know what Life RPG is. Basically, it's that with zombies and no police. Like the 'police' ever did anything anyway... Additionally, I for one do not want to have a connection where your IP address is right there for someone to mess with, so Hamachi is rarely a good idea unless you're playing with real-life friends.\n\nProblem 2Another issue is simply the fact that if you are not connected to a server that has a latency of under 100, melee is terrible. The zombies are horribly coded and you simply cannot do anything to defend yourself unless you have infinite ammo for a gun. Their hitboxes are far from where they appear to be when you get the signal of where the zombie is in the game. Another game-breaking issue is how rediculously hard it is to find any useful loot. This is how the loot works: 95% of the time, nothing will spawn. 80% of the time, it will have a durability below 50%. Literally all useable items in the game have a durability. Durability is used up VERY fast. Stamina is used up VERY fast if you don't have the skill maxed. Fuel is used up VERY fast. Hunger/thirst is used up VERY fast. Everything in the game is too fast paced except for the loot, which is too hard to find.\n\nOne way to pull it off could be creating a mod that displays a solid contrast color icon above any player not on the PvP list. Shooting them could either get you autokicked or ricochet off of them, not hurting them. Getting on the PvP list requires you to be away from other players and to wait 20 seconds. Getting out requires the 20 second wait and a 2 minute delay between enabling and disabling pvp.\n\nFor the second problem, until someone finds a way to slow the zombies down, there's not much that can be done. We also should try and find a way to raise loot spawning. Making durability/fuel/among others slower to be used up would be great as well.\n\nP.S. Please do not comment on my profile or try to friend me, as I will not be playing unturned anytime soon. Instead, please post here. I get a notification with every single comment, so if you want to talk to me, I will always respond if it looks like I should.\n\nP.P.S. Lots of people have been coming here to start a battle against me, be it defending Sir PewDiePie the Loud from heretical invasions or just plain trolls. A lot of them have deleted their comments, and there might be unneccesary clutter from me talking to them. Please dismiss this.","October 7, 2015","false","186.8"," 1,602 of 2,163 people (74%) found this review helpful 266 people found this review funny","74","602","2","266","563"

You can attach silencers,scopes,grips etc, it also has character  customization! which is also a great feature.\n\nGame is going in a good direction the dev know's what he is doing and what his plans are for future unlike the most other "Early access" crap the dev's don't pretty much even know what they want to do or are doing.\n\nThe area of the game is thankfully pretty big which give's it a open world feel.\n\nCars really? yes i said cars i did, driving is not the best but it's not worst it's quite fine actually. as well more to come in future such as boat's or maybe even plane's.\n\n2 season's currently one snowy and other your usual normal. But the snow one has a variety of different thing's.\n\nchallenging  many time's you will still have a chance to die even if you already have alot of stuff thus requiring  quick thinking and strateges.\n\nIt has a crafting system which is pretty neat, but you might get a lot of confused at first when crafting thankfully there are guides to help you get through that.\n\nSound's for guns and cars and all sort of that stuff are pretty neat and feel pretty realistic.\n\nNow let's go to the bad stuff\nIt's unoptized it might lag in your computer but the dev is always trying to optimize more and more over time.\n\nHackers yup hackers not everyone in this game is a hacker for sure, but you might see a few hackers in your game trying to make you're experience bad but the game now has valve anti cheat VAC which i think has helped ban quite a lot of hackers.\n\nMost of the community is very unfriendly you will see a lot of naked man with knifes trying to kill you for stuff, also i recommend taking a look at you're back you're friend might be trying to......\n\nThe net code is not so good actually, you will experience quite lag on most server's but the dev is always improving it, thankfully it does have a option to play solo.\n\nThe Ai has many problem's. they will sometime's go through wall's and such.\n\nConclusion\nWhat the hell are you really waiting? it's already way better then the other Early Access crap that's been put it to steam these days and even more importantly it's full free and it has a bright future, just click the play button and start having fun!\n\nOne of the best freetoplay game's out there, good crafting,challenging ,skillpoint system and with a bright future.\n===================================================================\n\nJoin our Giveaway Group and win every month over 2100 Steam Keys (Daily 70 keys) We love to share!\nClick to join our Giveaway Group!\nClick me and follow us as Curator","May 13, 2015","true","58.7"," 112 of 124 people (90%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","90","112","124","14","6"

If not, find yourself a map at the airport.\n\n+The graphics are... meh. Not the worst, but not the best. If you want good graphics, you have to suffer from lag.\n\n+ Zombies are a joke if you spent your time on timing your hits and backpedaling.\n\n3.0 Unturned:\n+ If you "beat the game" for the 2.0 version, this version is a joke. You get everything you need fast, but in 1 hour instead of 2 weeks. That's how easy it is.\n\n+ Zombies are much harder to kill due to the nerf on most weapons (Sledgehammer used to OHKO any zombie in the head, now its not), and they have longer attacking animations, so you have to practice fighting all over again.\n\n+ MUCH BIGGER MAP AND GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON GRAPHICS, HOLY JARATE. (TF2 reference, don't judge)\n\n+ Random cheat sheet when you open your menu and going into info, you can find yourself the whole f*cking map. Screw 2.0 PEI maps.\n\n+ MOAR GUNS, EVEN MOTHER OF RUSSIA JOINED THIS WARFARE.\n\n+ Zombies are stupid, they don't chase you out of the town.\n\n+ Apparently Nelson plays TF2 as well, if you know what I mean, that means you found the secret item :)\n\n+ Now that the recent updates are out, Unturned has offically became hat/gun simulator, waste your money on this game like how you did with TF2 or CS:GO.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VolatileCrocodile/recommended/304930/","VolatileCrocodile","VolatileCrocodile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VolatileCrocodile/","129 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: This review is from a mostly single player perspective. A few cons won't really apply if you are playing online. I will update it if I ever decide to try out the multiplayer aspects more.\n\nThe first thing I tell people when I mention this game is not to judge a book by its cover. Despite its simplistic and blocky appearance, Unturned is a very in-depth survival game and can be loads of fun. If you like survival or crafting games or just killing zombies I'd recommend giving it at try.\n\nIt couldn't hurt either way, the game is free to play with an optional "gold upgrade" that unlocks some things like special skins, extra character slots, extra customization options, and other fluff. It also grants access to "Gold" servers which grant more experience and loot if that is your thing. It's only $5 and I bought it mostly just to support the lone developer. Any money you spend on the game will not give you an advantage nor will anyone else be at an advantage for spending money. You know, the way it really should be. Even with access to gold servers everyone is still on a level playing field.\n\nPros: Several skills to choose from and level up by spending earned experience points as well as a bonus skill that give you unique properties.\nCrafting items is simple with plenty of recipes for various items from makeshift weapons to grilled cheese sandwiches. Some require investment in corresponding skills in order to be created.\nYou can build up bases from wood, metal, or brick as of the time of this review. You can also place most object onto vehicles or create makeshift vehicles. Need mobile storage? Slap a crate or locker down on your vehicle.\nSpeaking of vehicles, there's a good variety. Trucks, vans, sport cars, sedans, and other generic models can be found. Watercraft and aircraft were both recently added as well.\nLots of ways to play. Do you want to scavenge for what you need? How about farm your own crops or hunt wild animals for their meat and hides? Maybe you just want to kick back and fish? Or maybe you just want to hop in a car and mow down some zombies.\nA wide assortment of weapons, both melee and ranged. Guns and most ranged weapons can be customized with attachments.\nDifferent difficulties and settings to customize your experience if you like.\nA built-in map editor if you're creative type.\nWorkshop support so you can download player made maps and mods.\nRelatively bug free in my experiences. I can't think of any time I have encountered one.\nFree to play, as I mentioned before. Nothing even remotely "pay to win" about it.\nThe developer is constantly churning out new updates with tweaks, fixes, and additional content.\nJust by playing you will occasionally be rewarded with new skins for clothing and weapons. You can buy more or sell the ones you have or just trade them. At any time you can switch between your equipped skins and your actual items' appearances.Cons: Starting out can be more than a little rough sometimes. You might find yourself constantly dying before you can really get on your feet and it usually comes down to luck.\nIn singleplayer it is a little to easy to get your hands on military weapons and ammo. On servers not so much as there are usually other players already around the spawns to compete with.\nZombies pose very little threat once you reach a certain point.\nZombies cannot leave specified areas. For example if you are in a city and you leave the zombies will only chase you so far before just stopping at the edge of their boundaries. If I remember correctly this was done to increase overall game performance but I could be remembering wrong. Either way it makes areas outside of where zombies spawn completely empty outside of the occasional wildlife. On singleplayer there is little threat outside of cities but in multiplayer there is still always the looming threat of other players.\nGuns are purely "point and shoot" with no bullet drop or physics if that matters to you. I personally do not mind as much.Overall it's a good game that keeps getting better. Singleplayer is a good bit of fun but it's more fun to play with friends in my experience. Best of all it's totally free unless you want to drop a little money for some completely optional stuff.","April 17","true","104.2"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","70","75","5","3"

But guess what? It's the only game I'm hooked to these days. Survival has never been so luxurious. I know that this game has borrowed a lot of ideas from the other games, none of which I played, but I'm sure this will have new ideas and features as updates follow. And this game is free, so it definitely has a better grip than the rest. There is an update almost everyday as the game is being constantly improved. So I'm confident of a great final product.\n\nRight now, I do have some issues with the frames (FPS). It usually hovers around 20-25, but when I'm building or farming, it's horrible and goes below 10 at times. Not sure if it has got to do with the configuration of my system or if there's a genuine problem behind it. I'm guessing it's my pathetic system.\n\nPlaying with friends has never been so fun. Since it's free and small and great, my small-budget friends can also fit in. I can't sleep at times just because I'm constantly thinking of what's required for that "perfect" base. It was different in the start, though. I found it tough to survive with zombies around in the first few hours. Now I find it tough to survive without them being around. Nothing beats the feeling when I smash their infested heads with my Sledgehammer feeling like Thor.\n\nAnd after all this, I learn that the guy behind the game is a 17 year old. I'm 17 and I'm nowhere in life. Kudos to him, he's definetely pulled off something great. Give him the 5$. He actually deserves much more than that.","August 9, 2014","true","44.3"," 86 of 99 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","86","99","0","8"

The graphics are strange, but they're better than many other free games and even some paid ones. Solo is fun, but it does get boring pretty fast sadly. In multiplayer you have 2 choices---> 1: Join a random PvP server or PvE server and meet-up with 99% jerks---> 2: Join a friend's server or create your own, where you can play with or against your friends.\nI personally have done both. What I have found (some is based on opinion) are that random servers tend to be more laggy, especially on my computer. The random ones also tend to have NO SUPPLIES EVER!!! I'm NOT saying it wasn't fun. It was fun! The good parts about the random server are the extra challenge, which yes is VERY difficult to overcome these overpowered opponents, but possible. You can also play the hiding game, where you stealth around and try to kill your overpowered opponents with strategy such as: Using a horde of zombies on them, Making them bleed with a trap, or sneaking up on them and shooting them in the face 50 times with the worst gun in the game. OPTION 2: Playing with friends! I personally found this to be A LOT more fun! There are various mini-games you can play as well. PvE is also a good time! Although I did get bored fairly quickly, it was fun watching my team-mate derp around in a horde of zombies.\nSuggestions:\n- Create-Your-Own worlds, cars, etc.\n- Make the bridge lead to a city area, with MANY more zombies, but better loot.\n- Make the arena better in some way\n- Make alternate game-modes.\n- Add bikes, moter-cycles, and ATV's that go VERY FAST, but you fall off if you hit a zombie and it breaks down faster (A LOT of damage when hitting a zombie).\nOverall:\nThis game made me want to cry when I first played it. I wish I could feel the same feeling of when I first played it! I hope the creator adds some new spicy stuff, including the create-your-own stuff that he is already doing (I think). The game is difficult at first, but you as a player can adapt. This game is VERY GOOD!!!\nPersonal Rating:           4.5 Stars (Free Game Personal Rating)","October 23, 2014","true","197.1"," 61 of 64 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","61","64","0","1"

Before jumping into a PvP server, play alone and practice your shooting skills. Also, don't be angry when you die in a server, you can get your stuff back in no time. Don't always try to kill everyone you see, you may bite off more then you can chew. Also, if you get a gold account, make your skin color combo 54 118 60, that is the color of the grass. It has saved me a few times from idiots who walk right by you. Keep any of your guns on auto if possible. A few times, I'll forget that I have my gun on semi, and I'll run up on somebody trying to kill them, and one bullet will come out, and GG, you're dead (Unless they have a colt, they you're good). All in all, you have nothing to loose by playing this game, try it out before side with people's opinions.\n\nI'm going to give grenades and landmines a 9/11\nWould Allahu Akbar again.","January 6","true","724.4"," 94 of 113 people (83%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","83","94","113","35","0"

I have decided to go ahead and waste my time and type up a longer review. You dont need to read it if you are a normal human being who likes a good, funny post as written above but here is the full review for people who broke there laugh box (spongebob reference.)\n\nSo once you spawn in Unturned you realize the flawless graphics and amazing movement as you slowly  move around going from house to house from building to farm from military base to island until you come across a fire station where you find what is surprising, a fire truck. You then can get inside it and drive it with this games insanely well done genre breaking awesome driving simulation. This then enables you to all of sudden know how much gas exactly is in the thing and hotwire it instantly (because you were a mechanic post-apoc). After seeing the gas levels that have somehow appeared on your eyesight you then can drive. Now, this game is multiplayer so while your driving around you can come across other players. Some may be african american, some chinese, some caucasion... but this one I saw hapened to african american, and naked due to being a fresh spawn. Unfortunately I ran him over.

We finally got settled in with a stable agricultural system and somewhat of a defense system with our weapons and extras tucked away. This took roughly 9 hours. Now you must be thinking, "well it's just a game, it can't be that serious." Well then you dont know the pain of finding a home, building it, and then having it taken away by some little insect 10 years younger than you who begged their mother to spend money on this free game to become a gold member of a cheap mine-z/day-z knock off and then continue to wreck our lives after each feeble attempt to take back said cave, constantly shooting down six of us at a time. This child even single-handedly caused us to argue among ourselves, making us question the very foundation of our years long friendship, and while all of this is happening, the gold member insect child is befriending the admin of the server, orchestrating the plot to truly tear us apart, keeping us further from our home, and finally causing us to reach our breaking point by banning us from the server and tearing us from our home, as well as tearing apart our very friendship.

Really great gameplay for a free game, but others may say different. I myself and a lot of others would say it's not always the graphics that make a game great, but that it's the gameplay and storyline and all the little things that draw your attention like workshop items which include a lot of things like maps, guns, clothes, vehicles, etc. It has the feel to Dayz but Minecraft at the same time and is playable to those who could only dream to play big survival games because lack of the funds to be in the big league gaming computers, but other than that lets go to the Pro's and Con's.\n\nPro's:\n-Gameplay of the game and flow.\n\n-Workshop compatibility and simplicity of use to those who want to start producing items to those who professionally produce items.\n\n-Ability to jump right into a server or game and get destroyed by a kid younger than yourself. Doesn't take much to play well.\n\n-A well made group system to keep and eye on your team and foil your plans to smash your friends, that is unless you have a grenade. :P\n\n-Constant new updates and content added weekly or daily keeping the game interesting and open to optimization.\n\n-Overall fun and competitive sport with friends and the community.\n\n\nCon's:\n-The occasional kid or "adult" who thinks he/she is a professional gamer or game reviewer, who thinks their thoughts are everyone's and that because the game is blocky, and not sculpted from the microscopic level, it is a terrible game and shouldn't be supported. -_-\n\n\nWell I hope my review didn't take too long to read.

But on my second try at the game, the world really opened up. I realized the true potential of the game, being an awesome multiplayer survival game. The weapons are fun and easy to gather, and the game becomes SO much better when played with friends whether its PvP or PvE.

This was presumably due to the fact that I like this game.  The developer updates it and adds new stuff every 19 minutes because he may be insane, but insane in a good way.  I hate all zombie survival games except this one, probably due to the fact that it's the first game to feature a lot of zombie chefs.  The crafting system is awful though and I had to spend nearly four months reading FAQs just to figure out how to assemble a box to store my crap in.

I got the newsflash when I was gangbanged by 8 harmless looking zombies. I tried to fight back, swinging away with my flashlight, trying to get away but, was ripped limb from limb. Now, after a few long months, I have become a god with metal barricades and doors blocking my lighthouse base.\n\n11/10 would get gangbanged again\n\nEarly today,2/16/15, I went to play on my first server on the beta. OPERATION WARSAW I think it was and I began my adventure. After getting an axe and supplies, I mercy killed some zombies. BANG BANG went the gun and old Tyler knew what to do. I peeked over my fence and saw a completely black figure being chased by so zombies. I charged over to go help him and after a minute or so, they were all dead. The man and I exchanged gifts and parted ways. I returned to town to find two completely naked newspawns. Nexdah and hung_well were their names I greated them with a hello and offered beans. Well, I guess they didnt like beans so Nexdah gunned me down as I went for my axe. Well, I cursed them on the almighty world chat and a started to chat to the Admin: connerthegreat1. He was a jovial guy, and was kind enough to spawn a Schofield for me. I was pleased. About 10 minutes later, I saw my recent adversaries, Nexdah and his goon hung_well. I guess they were stil upset abut the beans so they swong and shot at me. I returned fire but was struck in the face. At this point Im dying with laughter so I respawned and walked the dusty road to Ontario to meet the Admin. Opon entering, I was greeted by the best looking base ive ever seen: a crane with a base/bridge thing leading to a skyscaper. I complemented him and I went with a planter full of carrots as a gift. I guess he didnt like them because as soon as i placed them, He shot me with a smile on his face. I fell out of my chair, crying with laughter and left the game.\n\nThat was the first and last time I will play on a server.","November 29, 2014","true","160.1"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","59","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourFutureLeader/recommended/304930/","YourFutureLeader","Darryl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourFutureLeader/","56 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSolid survival game. I wasn't very keen when I first tried it and felt lackluster because of my lack of knowledge towards the game. I later picked it back up and played with a friend who is miles more experienced than me and made the game fun for me.\n\nI've only clocked about 40+ hours to this game as I'm writing this and I already love this game so much. Definitely in my top 5 games on my Steam library. That's quite a big statement to make, right? (But definitely not the first. Sorry! :P)\n\nCrafting is very in-depth. Can be very difficult and fustrating at times. Takes awhile to memorize them. I'd still have to refere to the wiki every now and then.  The suvival aspect of this game is very challenge at first, but can be very fustrating later into the game, but surely it's miles easier than when we all first started playing this game. You always need to be wary of your hunger, hydration and sickness.\n\nBuilding is very fustrating with the terrain around you. The land might look straight but nope, it's just slightly higher. You gotta find the perfect location. I suggest one should always prepare the materials a day before you want to build so you can focus whole heartedly into the build. Ain't nobody wants to stop halfway of their build to go chop more trees, right?\n\nWith almost *every* game, it's clearly better played with friends. Adds a lot more fun and speeds up process if you're building. I've never played PvP so I can't give you a good picture of that. Longer hours of playing this game is not recommended. Take 30 mins break every now and then. I once played this game 6 hours straight and felt very heavy and burnt out (was building a huge house).\n\nSummary/conclusion:\nIdeal game if you just want to sit down, lay back and kill some zombies for a good 2 hours or 3. Anything exceeding 3 hours might just feel forced and heavy. Building is just a plus to this game. A very big PHAT plus. Nothing is more satisfying than you performing a headshot onto a zombie's head.  I hope you'll like this game as much as I do.","November 2, 2014","true","63.6"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","46","49","0","1"

At the time, I'd give it a 8/10. But that may change as I play the game more. I'll start out with the Cons, since really that is more important than the Pros.\n-Bad driving. You will get use to it if you play it for some time, but when I first drove I had such a hard time.\n-Slow. Now, this is and Pro and Con at the same time. It takes a long time for it to go to the next day. I personally like when the days go faster so you can move on. BUT! This is also a good thing. It makes it seem more realistic.\n-Servers. This is mostly why I rated this an 8/10. It is a major pain in the ♥♥♥ to create your own server. I'm hoping later on into the game the creators will make it so you can just go onto severs and it will have a button to make your own server. At the moment, you have to go and download a bunch of stuff, and mod some things, and it's just stupid.\n-Glitches. This may just be my computer being an ♥♥♥, but while I'm playing my character somtimes starts walking on it's own, and it's gotten me killed SO many times.\nNow onto the Pros\n-Fun. Now, this is a stupid Pro, but this is a very fun game. I could sit and play it for hours if I could. So if you love survival games, you'll love this one!\n-Free to Play. Really, when I first downloaded the game I thought it would be crap, because most free games are. But this one wasn't.\n-Atmospheric. I personally find this game beautiful, mostly when it's night. There are small details in the game, such as broken glass, rundown buildings, crashed cars, broken objects, and others.\n-Workshop. The Unturned workshop has LOT'S of awesome stuff. Maps, new weapons, clothings, and other stuff. If you get bored of the same three maps in the game, there are always new ones in the workshop.\n-Crafting. I enjoy the fact there is crafting in the game. A lot of survival games don't add that.\n-Zombies. Well, there are zombies in the game. Freakin zombies man. ZOMBIES. Sorry, I LOVE zombie stuff.\nHope this helped some people decided if they should download this game or not. Go for it.\nI'll be updating this once I play the game more, and possibly get the Gold Upgrade.

My first impression was some sort of DayZ and Minecraft mash up, and that is sort of what this game is.\n\nFirst off, don't let the graphics fool you. It is kind of cartoon-ish, but the gameplay is actually better than I thought it would be.\nIn my opinion, to get the best experience out of this game, you need to play online with some friends. One of my favorite things is having to survive and gather supplies, all the while having to deal with other players who are likely trying to kill you. Its a very fun (and sometimes frustrating) experience.\n\nFor being free, and a not fully developed game, this is very good. As far as gameplay issues/bugs go, I haven't really found that many, it runs very well. This is not a game that should be very computer intensive, so most people shouldn't have an issue running it on their computers, and that is another plus to this game.\n\nAll in all, if you can't afford some of the zombie survival games out there like DayZ, or if your machine simply cannot run such games, this is a good alternative.\n\n10/10","September 16, 2015","true","292.6"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","41","43","8","0"

Many people like to compare this to Rust, DayZ, or like Roblox. Although I prefer to call it it's own game due to it's unique style. (Please keep in mind, we all have our opinions.) The game is very balanced, doesn't require much graphics/RAM, and looks very beautiful. You can easily create your own server with some friends and fool around, or make a dedicated one with PVP or PVE. PVE allows you to cancel any Player vs. Player damage, although you still have zombies. The game is currently in devolpment, but is still quite an amazing game, even though it is made by a one man dev team. PVP is something I haven't quite played much due to some issues, but from what I've seen and heard, it is quite balanced with the weaponry and mechanics. I recommend this game happily, and hope the best of luck for this game.","June 21, 2014","true","109.3"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","63","82","0","0"

Why not 10? Well, the game is free and it is advantage, the whole idea of Unturned is also nice, I appreciate quite number of items, too,  but for this moment it is only possible to play it in single mode or by hamachi with friends. On dedicated servers plenty of cheats are destroying whole game, wallhacks, flyhacks, bugging of items is so common that I doubt that there exists at least one public server where we can play fairly. The next problem which I am gonna  talk about is the size of current map. It is too small to play it by more than 15 players at one moment: too few items, on PvP mode non-stop killing in the same places, and survival game becomes some Counter-Strike or so on.\nSumming up, great game with potential, I recommend everyone to play Unturned, but we must wait for update which will eliminate cheats from the server and give us bigger map.","August 18, 2014","true","22.4"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","44","52","0","10"

I logged on, went onto my favorite server, and was immediately horrified. My base, the metal masterpiece I'd spent 6 hours building the night before, was gone. When the admin informed me that he wouldn't help in the recreation of my castle, I went into a fit of rage. Luckily, all of my best loot (Assault Rifle, Bandages and plenty of Ammo) was still on my character. I decided to kill each and every person on the server. Which I did. Multiple times.

I was a bit skeptical about it at first, but as soon as I hopped on a server with a couple of my friends I fell in love with the game and put countless hours in to it. Unturned, though visually seems like Minecraft or Roblox, is actually a lot more like DayZ or Rust than it is either of those games, and is a great alternative to those games (and in my case, nearly pulled me away from them completely).\n\nThe game's graphics though simple actually grow on you (but could use work of course), the game performs well, and overall the game is a blast (especially with friends!). Gold is nice, but I mainly purchased it to support Nelson (the developer). The great thing about Gold though is that it doesn't make the game pay-to-win, I just think gold members deserve a little bit more content.\n\nI highly suggest trying this game, and if you like it as much as I do, I'd definitely purchase Gold whenever you can.","June 18, 2014","true","11.9"," 73 of 102 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","73","102","0","12"

The Inventory\n2. Zombies not staggering after EVERY hit\n3. Weapon rarity, in the newer version you find weapons like everywhere.\n\nAnd the things better in the current state is:\n1. Weapons getting weaker when you use them more\n2. The crafting menu that shows what you can craft without having to go to the wiki. This can also be seen as a bad thing.\n3. better graphics, that broken tube in the lab that scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me thinking something would sneak up on me 24/7 and the little things such as the UFO and sliding on ice.\n4. Being able to rotate building parts.\n5. Different zombies such as the fast crawler and the big, slow, tanky guy.\n\nHere are some things that are really good in both games and should be kept:\n1. The skills system. It is simply brilliant that you can focus on building, killing zombies or something else like running faster or sneaking better to avoid zombies.\n2. The freedom of building. Just being able to craft so many different building parts (and rotating them in the current version).\n3. Different clothes so you can look so swagelicious as possible.\n4. The variety of weapons and the freedom of customizing them such as putting a sniper sight on a shotgun <:).\n\nOverall, I prefer the older version more but that's just because I like the simplicity of games.

You play to survive against zombies and scavenge through towns to get food, clothes, weapons, water, ect. The weapons are common, food is scarce, and the animals are also a pain sometimes, but it's cool that the game formulates being an actual predator and not screw up your chances for survival. There's another mode known as arena, which is basically Minecraft PvP and building your homes. Crafting is also a bit complicated, I kinda hated bringing the crafting guide up every time I try to build things like foundations, chests, ect. But, overall, I enjoy the fun aspects of it and playing with friends makes it a whole lot better (but starting a server is complicated believe it or not).

When first joining this wounderfull server  at first you have 4 slots for space only untill you find a pack of different variations. thats when it gets fun . always save a axe for wood , pickaxe for rocks and katana to be a badass zombie killing machine.Make sure to eat , drink , and when fighting hit and back up hit and backup for best strikes & defense. You will enjoy this game as you are pulled into this survival world and your trial starts.Rating this game on a Early Access Game & its  Free To Play state .\n\nI have to give it  a # 8/10 there is still some work needed and they roll out quick and devs are responsive to bugs/glitches and very supportive of its build and im looking forward to more to come.

The human survivors are fighting against the zombies, metaphorically the horrors of the english and the world around them.

If you are in a city on multiplayer and you have forgotten to watch your health, hunger and that stuff, and then you just relised that you are freaking thirsty and you get panic and you don't wanna die so you scream "sh*t sh*t sh*t sh*t sh*t sh*t my eaglefire sh*t my eaglefire and dealge! sh*t sh*t, i CANT DIE now!!" and because you are on a multiplayer server the cities are empty of drinks and food and you just sit there leaning against the wall and wait for an miracle, nothing happends.. you just sitting there as a noob, as a survivour., a dead survivour.. and right before you die and leaning your head to the side and just starring at the ground and see some glue. You are a dead survivour you think, at least i can die with trying something awfull and you just drink that glue and all that happends next is that you are getting drunk and your world beginns to spin around and you think "this is the end" and relised after two minutes after you drinked glue that you aren't dead yet?! and you watch down at your health that it has stopped sinking and your thirsty-bar isn't 0 anymore?! Then you getting so much hope that you run around as headless chicken again because your thirsty-bar is low again, and after that close to death moment you had, you have never "non-seen" glue in your inventory and you find glue handsome.\n\nTake note that those insanely negetive reviews of this game are very old! they are from 2014! The game have been MUCH better and currently it has weekly updates! It is not as four-edges as minecraft anymore, it is much more detailed, much less glitches and much more things to do! It has even more maps than just PEI that were the only map in 2014! I think you should give this game a try! Its not old and negetive as those old reviews says about this game! This game isn't Unturned 2 anymore, its Unturned 3 and its kinda a new game!","February 19","true","260.6"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","75","40","53","34","0"

Wrong! This is something much better, initialy when you join a server you will have nothing (you are nude), you will search for supplies, weapons, whatever you need. But theres always other players! I myself became frustrated when i keept getting killed by snipers roaming about in police cars with sirens on, i tought they were hackers but i were wrong.\n\nOne day i met a black dressed man who asked me if i wanted to join his team and of course i said yes! He then spawned in several machineguns, armors, food and a police car came flying down from the sky and landed on that little annoying microspammer.\n\nI had not known that he was actually an admin and so i joined his team, we sat down in the police car. Turned sirens on and began hunting anything that was alive, zombies, animals, players (Mostly nude players) i spent half an hour sitting in the car shooting with my glorious machine gun not having to worry about running out of ammo because i had 20 clips. We drove over and shot anything in our sight.\n\nDon't fool yourself, there is no competetive multiplayer. Servers exist so that The Owner and his friends can hunt down nude players with machineguns in a police car while players scream: "Hackers!" "Help!"

I have un-dying support and admiralidy for this guy. Anyway, onto the review. This game may look crappy, but trust me, if you crank up the grapics it looks pretty decent.  People complain about body parts being deformed, that may be the case but Ark: Survival Evolved does the same thing.  The games map varies and is very fun to explore, there are secrets hiding everywhere.  The zombies actually have good AI,  AI that puts dayz zombies to shame.  The guns feel powerful and real (despite what they look like) and the fact that ammo for a specific gun is rare it makes you think about each shot (sort of like resident evil).  The servers in this game can be anoying at times, this mostly because the community is garbage, no matter how many times you say your friendly the guy with the compound bow will shoot you, and if you shoot an admin, get off the server emiedietly, or prepare to die.  It is very fun to play with friends on servers though. The game is continually updating, slowly but surely (It is a one man team for gosh sakes). Singleplayer is flawless, no bad community to get in the way and still relatively chalengeing zombies. Sound for a free game especially is not lacking, it is actually not bad. The game for a free game is, ABSOLUTLY AMAZING! And the only gameplay related con is that the map can be glitchy in certain places, like the construction site vault and you may fall through it, which can be very frusterating as you cant get your stuff back when you die. Lets go over the pros and cons of the game.\n\npros:\n-Good map, Varies, and is fun to explore, lots of hidden secrets.\n-Graphics are decent.\n-Relatively good AI.\n-Guns feel real and powerful, rare ammo makes you think about shooting first.\n-Fun to play with friends\n-Continually updating\n-Sound is pretty good.\n-FREE.99\n\ncons:\n-Guns look like crap and are hard to identify with real life.\n-Map can be glitchy\n-Community is well, GARBAGE, SHAPE UP!\n\n\n\n\nRemember, players are your worst enemy, be wary of them.

What about it? Well, let me tell you, it's one of the best games you will find on Steam. Look around, what do you see, well, I see a game that has an incredible future. Beta 3.0 really brings the game to life with the physics and shading.\n[] Starting off with nothing can be quite daunting is some games, but as soon as you find a village you can find a few weapons and clothes.\n[] Once you have the basics, why not find a gas can and a car to get you round the map in a minute or two.\n[] Next head to confederation bridge to get yourself a weapon and some ammo.\n[] Feeling a bit daring, head to the military base and take on the dreaded hulk zombie (you might want a grenade or a lot of ammo) this guy can take some hits. Don't use a melee weapon if you can help it when fighting the hulk zombie, but conserve as much ammo as you can, but don't worry, it's not impossible to find ammo so you can use the odd bit.\n[] Find yourself some military clothes (Ninja and ghillie suits look cool, but for bigger carrying spaces use the military clothes and vest).\n[]Maybe you're thinking: "What now? I have got some OP stuff, but nowhere to store it or somewhere to stay". Well, don't worry, because that area has already been covered by the awesome dev team. You can chop down trees to create a base. You will need to find nails and metal scrap for many things, but just blow some cars up for the metal scrap. You can build your base either massive or small, whatever suits you. You can craft crates to store some spare stuff!\n[] Why not make vault and jail doors for your base and barricade the walls with sandbags and barbed wire for extra protection, or make a garage for your cars!\n\nOverall, you really should get this game. In my opinion it is the best zombie apocalypse survival, creative game on Steam. You know, you should really get it, join a server, team up or go lone and kill others in PVE or PVP. Get this game and enjoy! You will thank me later :D\n-Flame","April 24, 2015","true","245.1"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","25","31","6","0"

I just like the game for how it's designed, and sometimes it gets my explorative nature going. Especially that one barricaded house.

The surprise is how well polished it is. With many working features, fun combat, fun items, fun crafting/building, and all for free? I wasn't really a voxel sandbox fan when I started but this game helped me see the appeal.\n\nThe only thing it could really use is workshop support.

Here we go then...\nUnturned is zombie survival, base building and looting game. This game has everything what good game needs. Base building is very good and wth the newest update 3.13.6.0 it's even better! Zombies are like normal zombies, killing ♥♥♥♥, guarding great loots. Inventory system is very cool in my opinion, to be honest all games should have grid-type inventory (this inventory system reminds me good old Rezident Evil 4 times). The weapons have great recoil and damage values. And it has ♥♥♥♥ing workshop and map editor. That means u will never play same game all over again, u can make mod it however u want! Oh and it has great level/skills system. And the best thing that it's free.... To be honest this is the best non-MMO/RPG free game on steam.The only bad thing is that you kinda get bored of this game pretty quickly. For me, mainly becouse of it's minecraft-like graphics. Maybe it's only for me but whatever...  THIS IS GREAT FREE GAME AND I HIGHLY RECOMMENT IT.\nPS: I recomment you supporting Nelson (game creator) by buying Gold edition. It's like 5 euros and basicly gives u gold suit (yes it has marketing/item system), few more characters and access to double loot/xp servers. I bougth it becouse I wanted to support Nelson. And yes, it was made by one ♥♥♥♥ing guy..HE MADE A BETTER GAME THEN WHOLE GAME COMPANIES TRY TO MAKE AND FAILS (I AM LOOKING AT YOU CALL OF ♥♥♥♥ AND ASSASINS CREED UNITY). AND HE WAS 15 YEARS OLD BY THE TIME HE MADE THIS... It's just mind blowing then u better think about it..\nPSS: This message is for Call Of Duty fans: Please don't eat me if I sayed Call Of ♥♥♥♥, just it's turing into ♥♥♥♥ since Black ops 2","November 23, 2015","true","193.1"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","76","28","37","13","12"

This game is fun for a short(!) time. I really had a good time with my friends.\n\nThe reason why this game is only fun for a short time is because you can get the good stuff in this game really really fast.\nIf you get to the airport and/or the military-base you almost have all the good stuff.\nAnd the zombies aren't a threat. The only real threat is hunger(You can grow plants or hunt). If you have a base, players aren't a threat.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but it doesnt really have any replay value for me(But I will check it out again when there is a new update)\nI've played Rust and DayZ. I like survival games. But I dont find this one challenging. It also doesn't have alot of items/content.\n\nI still had a good time playing "Unturned"\n\nI'm still giving this game a good rating, because its made by a 16-year old, its f2p and it is still in Early Access.\nThis game has alot of potential.\n\nAgain: This is just my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hauntingz/recommended/304930/","Hauntingz","Haunting","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hauntingz/","162 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnturned is an Alpha Zombie Survival game (similar to DayZ), with the least amount of graphics possible for people with bad PC's, and to be more kid friendly. Unturned is said to be like a better, unglitched DayZ.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is similar to DayZ/Roblox, some will say it's similar to Minecraft, but if they're judging it only by the blockiness of it's graphics, it's still not like Minecraft. The gameplay is very enjoyable and smooth, killing the zombies can become easy overtime (especially depending on the weapon and skill points you have), and the resource collecting concept of the game is a favorite of mine.\n\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer in this stage of development is, not very much. You host your own server by either port-forwarding your IP, or using an external program that allows you to do so. So far, you cannot go on and join a random dedicated server just yet, but they're working on that right now. I've noticed very little lag/desync problems when in multiplayer, but I do notice, the more people in a server, the more desync is possible to occur, but the lead developer also said that he and a few other people are working on that now.\n\nGraphics\nBeleive it or not, this game actually has graphics settings. Optimised or not, they exist. Some settings really tax the game preformance. I usually run with all on low (besides resolution) to keep with the art-style of the game. And I can run with FPS range of 60-90.\n\nMap\nI wont rate the "Arena" map, but I'll rate the PEI map, since Arena is a PvP map with items in the center and nothing but forests. The other map (PEI) takes place in Canada, equipped with an Army base, a few cities, two farms, a helicopter crash site, loads of zombies, ect. After playing for a while, I've gotten used to the map very quickly due to it's small size. One thing I would recommend for it, is increasing the size of the map by adding more land, cities, easter eggs, etc. (there is easter eggs in the map already). By increasing the map size, I think the game will feel much more involved and funner. Yet this all depends on the optimisation of the game, and wether it can handle a big map or not. Doesn't have to be as big as ARMA's Chernarus map, but still should be bigger than it's current size.\n\nSkills/Experience\nUnlike a lot of Zombie Survival games I've seen, this one actually has experience to it. You can get experience by hunting, killing Zombies, etc. and use said experience for say, increasing your health, stamina, "survival" (increasing survival helps you not become hungry or thirsty as fast), etc. And as you level up your skills, be careful not to die, then you'll lose all that you gained. But once you have maxed out a lot of your experiences, you will almost become unstoppable.\n\nOverall\nOverall, this game is really fun and addictive. Once I saw a few seconds of it on a Youtube video, I knew that I had to have it, and I was not dissapointed.\n\n9/10","July 16, 2014","true","41.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","2"

Unturned is a block character zombie survival game where you loot towns for food, kill zombies before they get you, and if you're in multiplayer, try and kill other people who are in your way. Because of the cute nature of this game and it's free to play access, it's Suitable for Younger Children.\n\nAs of 2.2.5, the game offers two maps, PEI which is Prince Edward Island and an Arena map for hunting or very quick game play. Most servers are set to PEI because they have more to offer in looting towns, crafting hidden bases, and waiting for other survivors to come in to town. It can be hard to figure out where to go at first but after playing a few hours you'll get the hang of where everything is even if you don't find a map along the way.\n\nAlthough, you have to remember that this game is Early Access and you will find the various glitches and frustrations that go along with that. There are bug reports being filed constantly and rightfully so. Even on a normal day without the baradement of glitches, you still have server lag, hackers, disconnects, and an unfriendly user API: It can be exhausting just trying to find a server, let alone play on them.\n\nBut, there is a saving grace to this. It's expected that 3.0 will come out soon and a massive overhaul will be set in place. Rather than going on server listings that are all but useless, there will be steam integration so players can join other players servers without spending half an hour finding them. VAC will be employed which will take out a myriad of hackers that troll the servers of Unturned with godmode, item spawns, teleports, and incredible server lag. There will also be a map editor for the connoisseurs out there. With all of the new implementations coming out it will dramatically change the atmosphere of this new anticipated game.\n\nMy opinion: for the casual player, this is a great alternative to play for a few hours and then to go play something else. For the more serious player, they will probably find their own server, get into groups, and become addicted to crafting for their own survival and the survival of everyone in their town.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nIf you're wondering, my credentials for a review as of 2.2.5:\n\n- over 200 hours of game-play\n- first guide comprehensively discussing the reputation system\n- seven level 6 characters (skull/halo)\n- killed 5,000 zombies\n- and killed over 1100 players.","August 23, 2014","true","414.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","1"

The following points should still be raised, as it reflects the game in its current state. Also, it's apparent that there are fanboys of some kind that downvote all negative reviews of this game, so I have heard. Now that I've seen this for myself, I can confirm that this is true. Careful when reviewing this game.\nAnother thing to note, is that I'm aware that the developer is only 16/17, and that he is the only one. This changes nothing. I am in no way putting that against him. I assess a game based on its quality/content, not on the age of the developer/s.\n\nThis game is somewhat lacking. Let's highlight the main points (in no particular order):\n\n- The developer's skills are yet to reach their potential/are a little sub-standard.\n- The tutorial doesn't teach you a lot.\n- Even on easy, the first hour of the game is just spawn, run, die, repeat. It's a harsh learning curve that takes a while to get used to.\n- You start with only 4 inventory slots. 4.\n- 3 of the 4 inventory slots are filled on spawn. That's 75% of the inventory. You have one slot.\n- Poorly balanced in places (some items are overpowered, some are underpowered).\n- Crafting system definitely needs revision.\n- Some items in the game are pointless.\n- Changing the resolution in fullscreen will fry your graphics card for 5 or so minutes, leaving your PC unusable for this period of time.\n- Controls can be very confusing at times.\n- The community is often manic/unfriendly.\n\nGood points?\n- I've not yet encountered any bugs.\n- The zombies seem to have adequate AI.\n- Singleplayer practice, so you don't have to be thrown in with other people if you don't want to.\n- Can be quite fun to play with friends, given that there's trust between everyone.\n- Updates do seem to change enough to make it worth a look at each new update.\n\nThe game shows some potential, but it needs a lot of work to reach it.\n\nOn another note, the "spawn, run, die, repeat" does stop after an hour or so of learning. One long and frustrating hour.\n\nI reccommend that you play with friends. Since the game is free, it might be worth giving it a shot, but only with friends.\n\nThe game is visually lacking, but this is an early access game. The focus is, and should be, on game mechanics.\n\n\nEDIT: I played the game some more and updated the review.\nEDIT 2: Came back after leaving the country for 2 weeks to 47 comments.

Got tagged as trolling... he's really a kid guys, just don't go the hub if you don't want to deal with kids.\n\nReviewer Note: This review will have 'negative' votes on it since fanboys are ~12y/o and cringe when they see someone hates their precious game. I had a guy come up to me and say "GTX680 is the worst" because I couldn't run the game at 60FPS. Just so you know...\n\nWARNING! The following wall of text contains my opinions.\n\nI already love games such as this, the whole surviving and zombie apocalypse thing is just perfect for me and this game is AN exception. It has major flaws.\n\n1) Crafting is overdone and time-consuming. In order to make a wall you need to spend 2 minutes of your life googling around the web to find a way, because Unturned, in no freaking way, shows you how to do it. You just have to know it or you can't craft anything out of your everyday-knowledge which works fine on Minecraft.\n\n2) Developer is ignorant. His name is Nelson and he is a 17 year old boy, and as you would expect he can't take criticisim. Whenever he does a Twitch Livestream and you decide to report a bug to him moderators just remove your message and post "shush now"+User_Name_Here. It doesn't end there either. If you go the community hub of this game and try to report a bug there people will go MAD on you. They'll be like "kid you're an idiot" or "u suck lol itZ Early Access YO". Those two literally happened by the way.\n\n3) Major FPS issues. If you have a rig that cost you more than $1500 and can run nex-gen games like Crysis 3 or Battlefield 4 at a stable 120FPS on 1080p, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Unturned runs at 20-30FPS no matter how much you lower your graphics. Since developer has next to little knowledge on Unity Game optimization, you need a PC that can barely run MeinKraft in order to get ~60FPS from Unturned and I'm not even kidding with you here.\n\nIn the end, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME unless you want your PC roasted. Seriously, try to fire that shotgun of yours and see how Unturned reacts.","July 24, 2014","false","19.9"," 1,074 of 1,893 people (57%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","57","074","1","43","248"

Убить в неё уйму своего времени - простая и приятная задача.\n\nЕсли сравнивать с DayZ, то в последнем единственный способ выжить дольше нескольких дней - кооперироваться с другими людьми. Там вас ждут и драма, и неожиданные повороты. Здесь всё намного проще, казуальнее, веселее и бесплатно.\n\nЗдесь можно быть мирным фермером, забарикадировавшемся в какой-то постройке в далеке от ходячих трупов, а можно грабить караваны. И какое же удовольствие приносит последнее. Всё, что стоит сделать после входа в игру - найти холодное оружие. Этого уже достаточно, чтобы раскрошить пару человеческих черепушек. Когда к вам в руки попадёт огнестрел, а-ля УЗИ или Калаш, то всему живому и мертвому наступает конец. А потом вы умираете от того, что какой-то новичок с только что подобранным пистолетиком с половиной обоймы укладывает вас и забирает весь лут.\n\nКрафт здесь не особо интуитивен, но проработан на высоком уровне. Можно отстраивать себе целые замки. (В сообществе игры уже не один десяток подобных построек на скриншотах).\n\nКонечно, многое хотелось бы ещё увидеть в будущем. Это и более обширная карта, и больше разнообразного лута. Но парниша-разработчик постарался на славу. Обещает в скором будущем ввести в игру Steam Workshop и тогда пользователи смогут создавать свои вещи и карты для игры, что сделает игру просто конфеткой в моих глазах.\n\nЧто уж говорить о том, что всем этим можно насладиться, не заплатив ни цента.\n\nBest of the best. 10/10.

I know theres bugs and issues with the game as well as theres things that aren't wrong with the game. And i will ignore any comments to this review that involve curse words and any hurtful or harmful remarks. Be an adult and take reasoning to what you're about to read, and don't get butthurt.\n\nPros:\n+Pretty smooth gameplay\n+Funny cartoonish feel to the game\n+Nicely constructed map\n+Creative HUD\n+Not too many bugs for an alpha\n\nCons:\n+The community is Aweful (Please refrain from getting butthurt about it)\n+Every server is either full or has raging Prepubesent kids in it\n+The zombies are insanly rediculous\n+The inventory setup needs to be rearranged to a more preffered state\n+Traveling isn't too time consuming but isn't worth only finding 1 bullet in a house\n+Over population of zombies\n+Crafting is next to impossible without google\n+Tutorial doesn't help as much as it should\n\nMain Review: The gameplay is acceptable and smooth. Everything runs fine and i haven't come across too many bugs. But it isn't the game itself that really has any problems, it's more of the people who play it.\n\nIf you are older than 12 this game is not for you. Just going to point that out. It WILL get BORING very very FAST. Wether it's naked kids running around killing anyone they see or overpowered players killing naked people, it's just really over all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There is no control in this game at all. Now I understand that its supposed to be some sort of mix of "DayZ" and "Minecraft" but in the long run its nothing like either game. Minecraft unlike this game is actually enjoyable. The community is nice and everyone has a good time because things are controlled in an even environment. Now I know this game isn's supposed to be played like that but at least give fresh spawns a chance to actually get something done. Give them 15 mins to gather what they want and then expose them to the harsh elements. Maybe then it will actually be worth while to try in multiplayer. Now with the DayZ side, DayZ Overall is a much better game. Yeah I'll admit its a bit over priced for early access but its still a game that will keep us all entertained for hours and days to come. Let admit it, you just can't beat Dean Hall and his team. But enough of that. I think its cool that someone has created a cross between minecraft (Graphics wise) and DayZ (Gameplay wise) But actually make it enjoyable. Just because a famous youtuber has played a game doesn't make it a good game. I'm afraid with the way that the community is going with little kid over load, this game will soon turn into another crappy DayZ knock off. The game can go a long way and be really good, but right now its going down hill for those who actually want to enjoy it. Please take this review into consideration and be mature about what you say. Don't down vote this review just because you're 9 years old and can't stand people who don't like the games you play.

This game is a work of art. The multiplayer maps are Rust from MW2, iceberg from putt putt protects the polar bears. And back garden from trolly trouts match up game. In the workshop, there are amazing curated skins. Like the P250: sand dune, MP9 sand dashed and who can forget the AWP safari mesh? Gamemodes? LOADS OF THEM! Like capture the flag, search and destroy, slayer, Nexus, putt putt's ping pong fun, cool cat's tenis ball toss, And who can forget beach kids guide to sandcastle building and totty and tilly's chemical compound drinking tutorials?!\n\nI recomend this game to anybody who reads this review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/errant_coyote/recommended/304930/","errant_coyote","Coyote","http://steamcommunity.com/id/errant_coyote/","22 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnturned is an excellent example of what the zombie survival genre has to offer. While it doesn't do anything significantly differently than other titles have done (borrowing heavily from inspirations such as DayZ and Rust), Unturned's balance allows for significantly more enjoyable gameplay than the brutal dog-eat-dog gameplay that the former two titles focus on.\n\nSurvival is challenging, but not impossible. Supplies are uncommon, but still plentiful enough that careful management of inventory and character status is the key to avoiding starvation rather than pure luck. Weapon rarity is particularly well balanced, as ammunition is scarce enough that I found myself grabbing firearms whenever I could, using them until their ammunition was consumed, and then discarding them as dead weight.\n\nThat is not to say the game is without its flaws. The zombie AI is rather basic, and either stands stationary or relentlessly chases the player. This is most egregious when a horde of zombies all converge into one tight mass as their AI all takes the same path, rather than a more dynamic system that would cause them to attack from a variety of angles. The map is an excellent introduction to the game, but is too small for the game to truly be a sandbox experience at the time of this review.\n\nHowever, I believe these flaws are problems that can be easily fixed. The game is still being actively developed, and improvements to the AI and the map are inevitable so long as that continues.\n\nIn conclusion, while I didn't personally think this game did anything especially unique in its concepts, I found its implementation and balance to be excellent. By borrowing ideas from the great names of the industry but enforcing its own ideas of balance, Unturned creates a game that is significantly more versatile in how it can be played. Want a challenge? Hardcore difficulty. Want to relax? Easy difficulty. Want to survive alone? Singleplayer. Want cooperation? PvE servers. Want tension and paranoia? PvP servers. Want to kill lots of zombies? You can get the supplies. Want to build a base? You can do that. I would recommend this game to everyone, but particularly to those who have played titles such as DayZ and Rust and, like I did, found something lacking.\n\nAnd hey, it's free.

Unturned is constantly getting updates and improvements, and the gameplay is very satisfying. Combat feels solid, crafting is enjoyable, and the survival mechanics make the game interesting even if you have established a strong base. I'm not a major fan of this type of game, but I can get hooked to Unturned for some time.\n\nMy issue is the list of tasks required to make real progress in these survival games. Want to build an object? Gotta get xp, gotta get materials, gotta keep thirst and hunger down; at some point the gameplay feels like work, and I'd rather get real things done in life. This is still a great option if you are a fan of survival sandboxes, completely free to play. I'd recommend finding a group to play as a team, as PvPvE prevents a lot of the awesome construction that is possible if people work together.","November 25, 2014","true","14.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Once you die a few times and get a feel of the game I'm sure you will come to love it. Keep in mind this game is still in early access meaning there are still so many great things to come to this already great game. This survival based game really make's you feel the struggles of trying to stay alive. Between keeping your food, water and radiation levels down there is always something to be done to keep you busy and keep the survival aspect of the game alive. There are plenty of places to see on the two maps we currently have and more maps are coming. You can play PvP with friends building untouchable bases and showing off your sniper skills or just survive with some friends looting and building a base to help secure your safety. Never fear, there is some comical relief in the game like beating zombies over the head with a frying pan; but don't take my word for it, come check out just how spectacular this game is for yourself.","July 18, 2014","true","115.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

(me: YES)\nDo you like survival games (me: YES)\nDo you like games where you must work together in order to survive? (me: YES)\nDo you like games similar to Dayz, Rust and/or Minecraft? (me: YES)\n\nIf you said yes to at least 3 of the 4 questions, there is no doubt, you will love it. If you didn't, download the game anyway and give it a try.\n\nFirst up, the graphics are really good and keep in mind the game is still in early development and there are a lot of hackers and bugs out there. In the 3.0 update however, 90% of hackers would be gone because thankfully the game is getting VAC (valve anti-cheat) and hackers will risk getting banned FOREVER. The gameplay is really fun and you have to watch out for 4 things, hunger, thirst, health and radiation. As you progress and search for armour and wepoans, you always have to watch out for the bars because if they drop, you lose all your stuff (unless you go back to that same spot). At the moment, death isnt a big issue because of REGEDIT and the fact that you can get your stuff back (in singleplayer). Once this is fixed, people will really need to worry about dying and other players.\nSo far, once you learn the basics, survival is easy and you start to get bored. But you forget one thing...you can build a base to store items and just look cool. You can create a farm to have an endless supply of food and make towers and bridges to get to nearby islands.\nIn this game, you simply cannot get bored (unless you only play singleplayer/pve.\nJust one more thing. You finished a base, built a farm and got every single item and clothing set in the game. You have every attachment and endless amounts of ammo. This usually happens at 100-200 hours (depends how good you are). You are just about to stop playing this game until the next update, but your mind re thinks to the cars. Thats right, this games got cars, and just not one car, many different types and colours of cars. You start searching, looking, to find all the cars in the game. The humvee, roadster, car, lcv and the three emergancy cars: the police car, ambulance and fire truck. You think thats all, but strange rumours cross into your mind. What if there is one more car you think. Well you are right. The incredibly rare APC is the final car in the list. I have been fortunate to find one early in the game, but many people out there, have hundreds and thousands of hours and havnt found an apc.\nUnturned: Build a base, Build a farm, Scavenge for food, Scavenge for water, Scavenge for medical supplies and Scavenge for guns. Kill other players and steal their loot, protect other players and form mutual alliances.

The game really has a larger group of insperation. A LOT of elements from Rust are included, such as the way you build houses. Even Far Cry 3 in the upcomming update, which allows you to make maps. But the honest truth about this game, spilling the beans right here, right now, is that even as it's still in it's 2.0 stage (soon to be 3.0) It is MUCH more refined and polished than either Rust or Day Z. The leveling system is excellent, the game mechanica are excellent, the CPU and RAM required to run it are so low that it could be played on a phone if ports were availible. I don't really care about graphics when I wanna play something fun, so this game does perfect for me.

That is why you cant play hero. There is no forest, there is not place to hide. Everywere is a open space and you can't avoid that. I dont want to kill on sight. But I cant stay away from hostile players because the map is so small and lacking in shelter that you cant walk around the player and end up in the open. Also freshspawns (and the 4 year olds who kill) them are everywere. There is no designated spawn points, freshspawns  just appear everywere. And because they dont even have clothes on there back they do stupid things. They try to punch you even when you clearly are going to win. Why?  To ♥♥♥♥ you off because regaining health is harder than a brick wall. You cant even eat food to gain the tineist bit of health so your pretty mutch screwed. This story sums up the community that I have seen:\n\nI was a fresh spawn. wearing only some pants I found and a hoodie. I met a freindly freshspawn who was cheking the houses on the other side of the street when a geared player carrying guns showed up. He spotted my freind but not me so I ducked onto a house to avoid his line of sight. As soon as I entered the house I spotted a steak knife on the floor and picked it up. The attacker was using a sniper at about 3 meters and didnt kill my freind yet. So I ran onto the street and started stabbing him, buying my freind time to scramble away. He didnt have time to react and was killed after my third stab. Blood on my hands I watched as his body lay bleeding with his gear laying around him. HE WAS LOADED. 5 guns, a HUGE backback and food enough to last a hurricane. I took what I could before I was caught in the middle of the street and ran to the hill nearby. While sorting quickly through the items my "freind" apeared before the body of our attacker. He picked up a gun i left there, and shot me 3 times.\n\nI hate humans.","March 5, 2015","true","6.9"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","68","23","34","19","0"

I stopped playing Unturned for a time, and when update 3.0 came out, it made even more fun.

Characters need both food and water separately in order to survive. Unlike minecraft, the ever-present zombies aren't knocked back a mile every time you whack them, so you have to use a little more stealth.  The stealth features not only crouch but also even more sneaky crawl mode, where you are almost completely undetectable.\nAnd finally, minecraft doesn't have these vehicles.  From tractors to jetski this games pretty much has them all.  The driving interface is simple and easy, reminding me of Farcry4.\n\nAltogether this game is a must-have for everyone and I'd recommend it to all\n10/10\n","April 9","true","94.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I do agree that this game looks a bit low in quality, but there are a few good things for this:\n\n#1: These low qualities provide better gameplay for almost ANYONE, but if you can't get it running perfectly, than something may be wrong with your computer.\n#2: Low qualities may give children the idea to play without realizing acatly what they're doing (Meaning this game is pretty kid friendly graphics-wise).\n#3: Finally, these qualities provide a much simpler understanding when it comes todetermining what an object looks.  For some people, this is good to recognize things easily both inside and outside gameplay!\n\nNot only that, but this game has a very simple gaming mechaninc, including crafting and realistic-looking driving.

If you choose to play on a server watch out for hostile players as they are a plenty in the game but you do get some quality servers its just finding them first.

This game is free, you have nothing to loose by trying it out.\n\nIf you like this style of genre then defiantly give it a try, its quite generic and features all the core elements that survival, PvP, base builder needs. The only tainted aspect that hinders this game is the graphics, and if you can get past that its a brilliant game!\n\nThe devs are active, they bring out regular content updates, and I can only hope that they keep this trend into the future.\n\nThis PvP aspect of the game is smooth, I faced no real issues with gun fights, the recoil is interesting, it brings skill into a gun fight! It will handicap the less hardcore players, and benefit those who have the skill to control it.\n\nPersonally I struggled with the building side to this game, and was much more interested in killing people and hoarding gear, therefore I can't give a fair assumption on if its a good system or not. From the shot time I spent building it seemed far too complex, it tried to use aspects of Minecraft and Rust, but just over did it a touch. Either way, nothing that the devs can't fix.\n\nI will round off this review by saying; if you have ever thought about trying it, do it.

Take minecraft for the craft, dayZ for every survival aspects and take a tremendous coop dimension and you'll get UNTURNED. This game is amazing for two aspects:\nOn the one hand the game is good because it's open-world/sandbox, full of weapon (knifes, axes, bats, and don't forget m16, ak, guns and everything to enjoy). The craft aspect is truly large and opened (from the rags to the home floor or roof); you can use everything you find to create another one. And the loots are really interestings because for the mass of tools, clothes and surely weapons.\nBut on the other hand this game is tremendous cause of the social aspect: you could find a friendly spanishboy that will stab you when you dont look at him. And when you play with a friend the game reaches the state of masterpiece. You will feel you fight for your own life as in the truth and be frightened  whenever you see another player (the funniest is when you have an overcrowded server).\nTo sum up it's the best free2play game available on steam. So support the young creator of this state of the art game by buying the gold upgrade.\nBUY IT NOW\n\n","May 22, 2015","true","149.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","11","13","4","0"

Maintaining food and water is a nuisance, but a necessity.\n\n-The downside to the game is that the "skills" aren't all fully functional yet.

However, that is due to the fact that everything I had gained VANISHED with the update. I had spent over 150 hours perfecting everything and enjoying the game, and it all went downhill.\nAlthough, it has its own servers now, so that makes it so much easier to play with friends. The crafting system completely changed in the update, but it became more user friendly (I had made a guide for 2.0 to link to in my web browser on Steam because there was literally no way to know how to make anything without just trying different items). I'll be getting back into it to find out if it's gotten better since the update (cars went from 0 to 99999999 almost instantly, flying around and crashing, zombies ragdolled like crazy, and everything was just off from what it used to be).","April 17","true","165.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","6"

One is the fact that they are expensive, dropping $20 - $40 per game, and two, they are simply unplayable. Not because of the game itself, but the fact that they are always run on  a server (not all the time but quite often) so you have to play online, which yes adds immertion and a sense of danger, but it can be annoying as well, admins with powers, kids camping an area not letting you touch it at all, and it can get too choatic. Unturned has a model I would love to see in other games like it (A few examples are, DayZ, DayZ Mod, Infestation Survivor Stories *cough* WarZ *cough*, H1Z1 etc.).  Unturned offers offline player, when you are the soul survivor of the apocalypse in canada, online play with or without friendly fire which is great if you want to play with others but not deal with too much danger (although a terrible community mind you). Personally I suggest getting a bunch of friends, all hooking up on hamachi, and go ahead and start a game, just for a small party. It's all up to you. I honestly would give it 10/10 but sadly there are no zombie moose at all, like it takes place in canada but no zombie moose. So it's an easy 9/10.","June 28, 2015","true","33.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

With a great developer constantly bringing out updates and listening to the community and working on putting this on the steam work shop, if you play this and there's something missing from the experience then you can bet it will be added in time. The gameplay can begin to get a little dull if you are playing by yourself for a long period of time or several gameing sessions but just wait a few weeks and you'll get right back into it. PLaying with friends adds a whole new level, it's fun just being able to share resources and set each other tasks while trying to avoid your ankles being gnawed off by zombies.

I have played this game a bit on single player (multiplayer will be the same thing except with people for deathmatch) and I felt like it didn't really bring anything new to the plate. For me, the graphics leave a lot to be desired. With simplistic graphics in certain games, it can bring out a kind of artistic feel in a game if done right. In this game not so much. Its on Unity, so I would expect a bit more than blocky, low-ress textures which seems unneccesary (just my opinion that I don't like the graphics). After reading other negative reviews, anyone with a computer with a lot of expensive, high-end stuff should just avoid this game entirely because its lags the game (don't know how because I started really getting into pc gaming this June) and the dev doesn't care so it most likely won't be fixed. The games programming is very well put together especially for a 17 year old doing a one man job to program it, yet it feels like he took a bit of the Roblox script and pasted it in the game. Specifically the magnet AI and from what I've heard you can walk enough to the point where you can have a whole hoard of zombies just following you. From what I heard with multiplayer, It became pretty bad since Pewdiepie showed his "bro army" the game and I already played plenty these kinda games to know what multiplayer is like. I can't say that this game has potential because the damn "zombie apocalypse survival game" idea has been done to death since a famous Arma II mod came out. I know why I got bored with this because I already played the roblox version so I kinda know whats what. Get it if you want 'cause its free (except for membership) yet don't expect much change from its roblox counterpart because I didn't see it myself. Also don't expect a real change from any other generic zombie survival game because its going to take a while to find one thats unique from the rest.","August 8, 2014","false","5.2"," 67 of 121 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","67","121","7","11"

It isn't the best game I've ever played. But by god if it isn't up there for me. Although it has the minecrafty-dayz mix, it works perfectly. Know whats better? It WORKS. It isn't broken, it isn't choppy (at least in my experience) and is a sort of unexpected joy to play.I honestly didn't think it would be as fun as it is, and I highly reccomend it.

Now I am familiar with the developer zackzak on roblox and his deadzone and battlefield games that I greatly enjoyed until quitting roblox 2 years ago. I found this game in my subscription box from etalyx's channel at YouTube.com/gamersdissent and free to play can't hurt. Also this is early access and that should be taken into consideration.\n\nThe pros:\n- Amazing world to explore:\nVariety of locations such as barns, small cities, airports, military bases. All locations have unique loot that makes sense in the location. Ex. Shotguns and seeds in barns while there is body armor and assault rifles at military bases.\n\n-Intricate crafting system:\nLots of craft able items, from storage containers to car jacks, to even be able to construct entire bases. Wood foundations, used to make entire homes! Although learning the recipes is a curve and there needs to be a way in game to find them or atleast help as me and my friends were always on the wiki\n\n-Free to play:\nWhile there is a gold subscription for extra skins etc, the core experience is completely free, and just for doing that I'm considering buying the gold membership to contribute to the single 16 year old developing this game.\n\nThe cons:\n\nSound design:\nSome if the sound effects, such as zombies and vehicles sound decent. But sounds like the guns, which are meant to be empowering with a sense of feel and force of such a weapon, sound flat and I feel as if I fired a water gun forwards my foes.\n\nUnity engine:\nWhile a developer like this may not have access to some of the more expensive engines to base their game on, unity was a terrible choice. Choppy frame rate even on decent hardware, even running any type of decent lighting is a performance killer, dropping to sometimes 40 fops or lower on my computer.\n\nServers:\nAt first playing with my friends was a challenge, no official servers to play on, no server browser, and now the 3rd party server host me and my friends were using has overloaded. There is also no anti-cheat system put in place so hackers were also a problem on the few public servers I was on. Item hacking, teleportation, dying from an unseen opponent then having them teleport to your next spawn, etc. Definitely not a welcoming experience, and framerate drops on servers is also common as many are hosting from their laptops/desktop and it's not always a 24/7 dedicated server either\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis game brings back memories when I used to play roblox with my friends all the time. Great fun to be had here and some great memories to have. Some performance and server issues and some odd choices for sound design hold this back, and I'm more into gameplay over graphics which this game excels in. C'mon it's free to play, updated regularly, give it a try and buy the good membership to support development\n\nEnd Score:\n8/10\n","July 12, 2014","true","21.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

You may ask why someone would put that much time into a free game. The answer is quite simple: I don't have a very good computer, so I play Unturned as an alternative to DayZ and Rust. Although, even if I could play those games, I would come back to Unturned now and then. Most of my hours have been logged as an admin on servers, but I've also logged 200+ hours of PvP. Unturned is a great game to hop on, join a kitpvp server, and have a go at other players. Even if you want to play with your group of friends and base build, it's non-stop fun. There's always something going on and the full moon nights are as fun as can be.\n\nI have seen the 3.0 version of this game go through thick and thin; I've also seen it go from a great game to unplayable in a single update. Nelson tries his best to keep this going and keep it updated, and he does a good job. All the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game that I have had to deal with -- from squeekers glitching into buildings/structures and killing me when I am fully looted out and them calling me "trash" in chat; to not being able to teleport for several weeks as an admin due to getting stuck in the floor 96/100 times; and the game just not working in general -- has formed a sort of emotional bond with Unturned; I always came back to it and always kept trying to play it, no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off I was from crashing 8 times in 15 minutes. Not to mention that he broke Rocket Mod so many times that I lost count.\n\nUnturned is great for so many things and, as a server owner and having logged almost all of my hours as staff, I can confidently say that there aren't that many hackers/cheaters on this game. In all my 715 hours, I only ever saw three "hackers"; two were on devtest and one on Canada. One was flying around and I banned him within a couple of minutes (devtest). Another was spawning in gear (Canada). And the last was using god and spawning gear. I banned all of them, of course. I would have to say the only drawback of playing this is that there are 10x more squeekers than most zombie survival games.","September 30, 2015","true","056.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

And altogether a decent idea for a game. Little to no bugs and what not.\n\nThen it happened - The invation of the little kids who can't spell correctly yet they're "Vastly superior" to me because I just joined the server. Then they rage quit, or vote kick and or bad me for simply murdering them so I can receive my items back.\n\n\nPros -\nLittle amount of bugs.\nBlast murdering little kids.\nDecent graphics\nEtc\n\nCons -\nLittle kids roam free on the public servers, quite mayhem.\n\nYou call them little kid, and they will try to claim you're a little kid "Yet they cannot complete a simple sentance"\nHackers all over the place\n\nCars are hard to come by, due to people either taking all of them, or blowing each and every one of them up, because why not?\n\nLow variety of vehicles. It's pixles for God sake, add more into the default game..\n\nLooters, dear God the looters; advice, never build a base on a public server, please do yourself that favor unless you can sit there watching it 24/7\n\nDid I mention to KoS'ers?\n\nGets very boring losing your stuff over and over again, due to KoS'ers. You know what your doing like me?\nThey have an answer, HACKS.\n\nContastly banned for killing some one, on a PVP servers; after they shot first.\n\nKOS'ERS\n\nYoutubers play it so much == Ohhh so much little tiny brats with nothing better to do with their lives.\n\nNow, I'm going to stop there..\n\nRecommendations:\n\n16+ Servers, give the little runts their own play ground, let us have ours.\n- Ah hell they will figure out a way in any ways.\n\nFinal statement :\nYou will be killed on sight if you go near any one. Why? - Who the bloody hell knows.\n-Doesn't matter if you are passing them in a car, "GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION" or shooting zombies, they will just kill you take your stuff and go.\n\nEven on PVE servers, people will find a way to kill you.

Basically It's like DayZ & Minecraft had a baby, there's base building, and the guns are actually really satisfying to use. Also, the game is actually pretty hard, if you get a horde after you say goodbye to any chance of surviving unless you have a good melee weapon like a chainsaw or a good gun with enough ammunition, It's a great game, and it was made by a lone teenager, that's pretty impressive.","July 29, 2014","true","41.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

You also have the base building\nability, which is an awesome feuture for an Early-Access game. In your base you can park your cars,\nput some lights on it and defend it, and you can be that jerk that will make his base near the airport\nand snipe some beaches.\nBy getting the Gold membership you get atm more skin colors, faces, a darker HUD and\na goald name so people will think that you area pro. On the other hand the game can become repetitive after a good amount of time is put into it, I personally think that going from town to town every single time with an axe to farm all the zombies and get killed by the nude noob with the kitchen knife is pretty repetitive. Other than that the game is very good with a friend. I give Unturned a good 8/10.-1 for small map and -1 for the repetition.\n8/10","January 4, 2015","true","196.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","3"

I cant wait to see how much better it gets. If you are looking for a survival type game play this. Think Minecraft mixed with Day Z. Since this is early access I have suggestions for the developers at the bottom (if they even read this :P).\n\nPros: You can get high as ♥♥♥♥ off of berries it is AMAZING (Do not take that out!!). Building your own multi-floored house. The survival feeling is truely rewarding. Customizable Weapons. Leveling System. Good variety of weapons, clothing, food and tools. PEI map is a good size and the islands are a nice bonus. Vehicles are different from each other (require more or less gas, drive faster or slower, take more or less damage). PvP can be turned off. Ability to grow crops. Doctors clothing helps prevent dieses. You can repair vehicles. Armor helps with bullets and melee.\n\nCons: Ladders can be annoying. Very hard to see when your vehicle is damaged (makes sense but damn its annoying). Crawlers can be difficult to hit. Nothing at the end of the bridge (Other than acheivement).  No boats for easy acess to islands (Yet?). Connecting with friends is a bit of a hassle. Unless you have a vehicle zombies do not give up the chase (if you get out if sight you should be able to get away).\n\nSuggestions: Cars should be a little faster (fastet car go maybe 90 instead of 70 KM/H). Ability to make row boats (paddles and boat build sepertley). Add a boss type zombie (kind of like a tank from Left 4 Dead). Ability to wear a helmet over a hood (Like the miners hat or night vision goggles over ghile hood). Make the military vests able to carry a few clips of ammo (1-3 of the 30 round clips). Ability to swim under water would be awesome, could also add sharks and fish. Also ability to fish would be awesome (but make it that fish are only in certain areas). Ability to form a group in game for chest sharing (so you dont have to do it through steam) Add a defibulator (idk how to spell it lol) to revive friends within a time limit (20-45 seconds). Admin command console (spawning items would be to op but ability to turn off your hunger and thirst so you can host for people would be cool)","July 29, 2014","true","464.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

It is without a doubt similiar to DayZ, and like most games recently, has the blocky graphic choice like the much more widely known game Minecraft. This combination is rather pleasent and makes  the game have a little more humour in it. Now, with aesthetics aside lets talk on the gameplay.\nIn the game there are currently two maps available. The two maps are called Arena and PEI. Arena is basically a map without any zombies and is all about survival/constructing a base. Its useful to get started off in and to try out the basics. PEI on the other hand is all about the zombie infested towns and scavenging. There are quite a few towns to get supplies from, and clearing them out of any zombies can be quite a pain. But it is completely possible to do. A person can simply drive into a town and honk their horn to get the attention of all the zombies and then proceed to run them over. Now if someone doesn't have a car/truck to do this or want to risk the health of their beloved transport then they can always just run around the town until they get a good amount of zombies chasing them, followed by a long time of zombie killing. Guns in this game can be hard to come buy, and bullets even harder. But some people can take advantage of the item respawn when leaving a map. All items will despawn and reset upon the host/player disconnecting. (Though any constructions or vehicles will stay where they are) This allows a player to camp a certain spot and gain items from it very easily. It is a little cheap, but none the less a strategy to gain items. (One item people try to obtain is a certain backpack that has a large amount of slots available but a low spawn rate) One last thing that can be done in this game is turning Arena into a storage type of base in the start of this game due to the inventory being kept in-between maps.\nNow certain things (Such as making a chest/crate for storage) requires the player to use the leveling up system in the game. Chopping down things or killing other things (With something  besides a vehicle) lets the player gain experience that can then be used to purchase a wide variety of skill improvement. This include endurance, health, crafting, and among some others. It adds to the game and makes it rather enjoyable to play. The only downside is that if you die, depending on how developed your traits are, you shall lose experience.\nFinally, this game has many other aspects that could be explored with very few things that can be seen as annoying. (Though one of them being ladders) But talking about it in this "review " would take up a lot of time and space. So all in all I recoment this game to people who enjoy some of the previously mentioned games at the start of this.\n\nAlso, players that find it annoying to constantly try and figure out how to make certain things can always use a wiki. (There are a few different wiki's for this game)","August 5, 2014","true","46.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This game is in early access so any reviews on here positive or negative are completely subject to change and could be completely irrelevant overtime, however these are MY OPINIONS on the game as of now.\n\nOkay first off this game is made by a single 17 year old and I have major respect for him to be doing something of this caliber at his age, good on you. Now for the review, this game is bound to be compared to dayz and minecraft for very obvious reasons, and as sombody who loves minecraft and dayz, I thought this game would be perfect for me. However this game falls in a grey area for me and I really didn't find any enjoyment from playing it. It doesn't offer the hardcore experience dayz has, nor the endless exploration that minecraft offers. I realize that base building is totally in the game however it just doesn't compare to minecraft's. The zombies are very unthreatening and if they manage to kill you the map is small enough where you can fairly easily reclaim all your lost gear in a short amount of time which takes away a fear of death, which is very important in a survival game. If you want a survival game with building and enemies just play minecraft, and if you want a more hardcore survival zombie game play DayZ. I'd say if you're a really young kid who may not want to or may not be allowed to play DayZ you'd certainly find more enjoyment out of this game than I have. However otherwise this game doesn't offer any experience that you couldn't find a better version of somewhere else. All this being said though the game is free!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Razuh/recommended/304930/","Razuh","Razuh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Razuh/","273 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnturned is a game by a 16 year old named Nelson Sexton. That alone is impressive, not even considering the fact that it is currently one of the most popular games on Steam – even going so far as to reach the third 'currently playing' rank in the statistics recently. Personally, I've spent quite a few hours on it – especially during the first few days of its release. I did review it before, but it was a short one, so considering the amount of time that I've put into it since then in such a short amount of time, I figured it was about time I gave it a proper review.\n\nUnturned has been compared to many other popular games.I've seen many compare it to DayZ - the survival element, loot collecting and zombie murdering all fit in alongside the PvP. Another comparison is Rust - the base building style is very similar to what I've seen of Rust, so I can agree with that.\n\nMany people also compare it to Minecraft in ways of graphics,I do not agree. I've played Minecraft a lot myself, so I can outright say that it's wrong to say it has Minecraft style graphics. Minecraft uses 16 bit textures on pretty much everything in the game - whereas about 95% of the objects in this game don't have textures on them at all, not to mention that the item sprites are not 16 bit at all, as with Minecraft. The blocky element of the game comes from simplicity - the only thing that I would personally compare with Minecraft would be that the player models are extremely blocky, but even then, that's because this game originated in another game called ROBLOX.\n\nNow that my mini rant is over, I'll finish my review.\nI love playing Unturned. There are lots of things that make me enjoy the experience - the loot, weapons and building are some of my favourite.\n\nLoot SpawnsThere are plenty of different items to find in the civilian, police, militia and military loot spawns. You'll find building supplies, medical supplies, food, clothes, weapons and much more. There's usually quite a few things worth taking in every town, in fact, there's usually something good in most buildings. If you're looking for something specific, loot the correct buildings. Low on health? Check the pharmacy for medical supplies! Need gas for a car? Go to the petrol station or mechanic's. Food is commonly found in the café and pizza place (despite the lack of pizza in game), and surprise surprise, military equipment is found in the military tents, towers and the military base.\n\nWeaponsThe weapons in the game are also great - you can find plenty! There are katanas, sledgehammers, bows, crossbows, SMGs and assault rifles (Also my favourite, the sniper rifles, especially the Timberwolf) to kill both zombies and players alike. Many of the weapons that can be found in this game are in-game representations of many famous weapons. The Zubenekov, for example, is more commonly known as the AK-47, and the Desert Falcon is distractingly comparable to the Desert Eagle.\n\nBuilding StructuresAnother of my favourite things in Unturned which I've probably invested too much time into is building. Once you've gotten yourself some tools - an axe or chainsaw, a pickaxe and a handsaw, you can build up gigantic houses, bases, bridges - or as I've seen in some cases, even huge ships in the ocean! There's also another use for the supplies that you gather using those tools - creating crates and chests to store your hard-earned loot inside. The great thing about these is that stacking items will stack infinitely inside of storage containers, saving a great amount of space.\n\nI could probably ramble on about the other features of the game for a long time, but I'll leave the rest of it for any of you who are still reading and haven't yet played the game to find out. One thing to keep in mind is that if you need more information on a certain feature or item in the game, you should go to the wiki. A lot of people including myself detail everything there is to know about each part of the game, so most of what you want to know will be there. There's still one key thing to remember before any of you who are still uncertain choose whether or not to try Unturned – it's FREE, so give it a shot!","July 28, 2014","true","101.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

This game is downright fun. It has the classic zombie survival feel, but is much more lighthearted. the PvP is incredibly hard, as two hits from most weapons will kill you. Zombies are easy to deal with one by one, but in hordes you NEED a melee weapon The Building is fun, though you will need to grind for hours to do anythying impressive. Crafting is complex, as in have a guide nearby or you'll be stuck for hours complex. But once its memorized it is quite simple. The graphics have that indie/Minecraft charm, gameplay is fantastic, but gets a bit old after 40+ hours, as with the majority of games. With friends, though, the expirience is 10X better, and to top this all off, it's made by a single 17 year old. Holy. Fricken. Crap.\n\nSo, to Nelson Sexton, good luck in the world of gaming!\nAnd to you, my fellow survivors, go forth in the land of Canada, where everyone has guns (according to this game), and screw some zombies over.\n\n8.5/10 Very Moist.","August 19, 2014","true","162.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You can play with friends and find other people, 2. Its free, 3. Its really fun I have almost 250 hours played on Unturned and I still continue to play it. I have a lot of things to complain about but before I start I still recommend you play this game because this is just my opinion. You need to increase optimization I cant stand only getting a 30 fps I get better frames on GTA 5. You need to take away the suicide feature, Im getting sick and tired of killing someone then they are back in 2 minutes driving in a car then run me over and they keep coming back THIS CAN GO ON FOR HOURS! especially if the server implements Teleporting but thats not your fault. You also need to make it so if you have over a 150 ping you cant join the server because im tired of getting people from Mexico that cant even speak english ruining my ping especially if they are driving cars this is going to lead on to my next complaint, You need to make it so people with terrible pings are not invincable in cars anymore I shoot people in the head 9 times with a Grizzly they have no helmet on and they dont die and they end up running me over when Im behind a tree because their pings are so bad but if you do my last suggestion about making it so people cant join with high pings this shouldent be a problem.

Don't let the graphics mislead you; this game is packed with a lot of things, and it's not like all the other games that say F2P but are actually P2W.

If there was a Meh rating, I would rate it that, but leaning towards recommend. Singleplayer is fun and all, but gets lonely and boring.

First off, I'm gonna start off with the pros, and then after that, the cons.\n\nPros:\n+The game is fun, there's a lot of stuff to do. Since there's a lot to do, it makes you want to keep playing the game for longer periods of time.\n+The community. The Unturned community, unlike a lot of these survival games, will help you out if you need to. Still, there's the occasional bandit that kills people, but that bandit will end up dying of thirst if he seeks for victims for too long.\n+Items and crafting. Like I said, there's a lot of stuff to do. Unturned has a wide amount of items to make. The item spawns are pretty easy to memorize if you replay a map two or three times, which makes the game simple you're new, or if you die, you know where to go find some loot. And the crafting is pretty nice for the most part. Nothing wrong with it except maybe they should add it so you're available to all of the crafting recepies, not just few.\nCons:\n-Items spawns. The item spawns can either be very good or bad. For the most part, a little overpowering. You could spawn in one of the villages and find probably the best melee weapon in the game: the katana(or the sledgehammer if you will). And other things, such as the lighthouse and the golf area has very few weapon and food/water spawns, so if you spawn at the lighthouse, you're screwed because you're gonna have to travel a long way if you wanna get to a decent place with a decent amount of resources.\n-Zombie strength. Even if you fully upgrade the perk immunity and warrior, you can still die pretty easily from zombies. Sometimes, they're just a liiiiitle overpowered. If you get cornered with nothing but a katana and pistol, kiss those items goodbye, you're dead! (a group of zombies are fun if you only have a frag grenade. c:)\n-Too addicting.(don't take this one seriously...) I can't stop playing this game without forgetting to do my homework.\n\nAnyways, this is my short review of Unturned, and I hoped it helped you somewhat.","September 2, 2014","true","49.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

This game.\nWhen you start it.. i promise you are going to hate it.. so much.. zombies will be your worst enemy.. take my hint.. when in big groups of zombies just keep turning in circles and hit their heads.. and against 1 zombie just move back periodically as you aim for the head. now the second you get over your fear of zombies you will hate the game for the second most annoying thing. kids who KOS (kill on sight) now from time to time you'll always find someone like myself to give you shelter and help you out but KOS kids are going to make your life a living hell.. give you trust issues.. and wait till you get a decent weapon to shoot you with the game's best sniper just to troll. But never has this ever stopped me from playing this wonderful game.. updates making it better and better every time.. Make a steam group and invite some people and go on killing sprees on different servers.. kill other geared groups and steal their hard worked for loot  then trot away feeling like a boss. build your own mansion with enough players that it will never be subject to trolling destruction and simply.. when you start to love this game. you're not going anywhere.","September 15, 2015","true","713.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","1"

First off, I'm gonna start off with the pros, and then after that, the cons.\n\nPros:\n+The game is fun, there's a lot of stuff to do. Since there's a lot to do, it makes you want to keep playing the game for longer periods of time.\n+The community. The Unturned community, unlike a lot of these survival games, will help you out if you need to. Still, there's the occasional bandit that kills people, but that bandit will end up dying of thirst if he seeks for victims for too long.\n+Items and crafting. Like I said, there's a lot of stuff to do. Unturned has a wide amount of items to make. The item spawns are pretty easy to memorize if you replay a map two or three times, which makes the game simple you're new, or if you die, you know where to go find some loot. And the crafting is pretty nice for the most part. Nothing wrong with it except maybe they should add it so you're available to all of the crafting recepies, not just few.\nCons:\n-Items spawns. The item spawns can either be very good or bad. For the most part, a little overpowering. You could spawn in one of the villages and find probably the best melee weapon in the game: the katana(or the sledgehammer if you will). And other things, such as the lighthouse and the golf area has very few weapon and food/water spawns, so if you spawn at the lighthouse, you're screwed because you're gonna have to travel a long way if you wanna get to a decent place with a decent amount of resources.\n-Zombie strength. Even if you fully upgrade the perk immunity and warrior, you can still die pretty easily from zombies. Sometimes, they're just a liiiiitle overpowered. If you get cornered with nothing but a katana and pistol, kiss those items goodbye, you're dead! (a group of zombies are fun if you only have a frag grenade. c:)\n-Too addicting.(don't take this one seriously...) I can't stop playing this game without forgetting to do my homework.\n\nAnyways, this is my short review of Unturned, and I hoped it helped you somewhat.","September 2, 2014","true","49.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealKrezzer/recommended/304930/","TheRealKrezzer","Krezzer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealKrezzer/","9 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy opinion about the game:\nThe game is a lot like DayZ but it has its own spin to the formula. The maps are a lot smaller than those in DayZ and there is a crafting system in the game which lets you create makeshift items and bandages but also bigger things like makeshift vehicles and huise parts like walls and floors. The game gets an update every week and it is easy to get into the game.\nThe only negative part about this ame is its difficulty and the community. The game is very easy especially in single player! You can get fully geared in less than 20 minutes which might sound great, but when the community consists mostly of a younger audience, mostly 9-12 year olds, this gets annoying really quickly as you will often find those people just killing on sight and camping high traffic areas.\n\nOverall I would recommend this great game! It's a lot of fun especially with a couple of friends. And after all, this game is free to play! Give it a shot! And for those wondering, yes there are in-game purchases, although they are only cosmetic.\nGood luck and have fun!\n","December 31, 2015","true","274.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

And it's permanent, unlike other F2P games where you have to make $50 microtransactions every month for an account. It's very realistic, and with great mechanics and items and realism. Also, thought I'd mention this game is made by a 17-year-old guy. No-one else.

Includes 3 different gamemodes, survival which is the main focus, horde which is basically zombie wave survival, and arena which is just a hunger games mode. In survival you play the part of a survivor whom has woken up completley naked on one of the few maps. you then have to scavenge around for supplies and keep your hunger, thirst, and infection in check while not getting eaten by zombies, shot by other players, or dying of any natural causes.\nMy favorite part of this game is the combat, which includes a slightly higher than average damage model. (3-4 shots with an assault rifle and you are dead) There is no bullet drop or time, meaning skill is based heavily on how you control recoil (tap firing is a neccesity) and how well you can manuever and flank. The real downfall of this game is the community, which includes mainly kids under the age of 13. In all of my 1500+ hours of this game have i rarely met a person whom has not just shot at me on sight, of even tried to subdue me non-leathly, however this also means when you do get into a firefight, it is probobly with a 12 year old running the game on a mac book air. Most servers with an admin abuse their powers. The community does make some cool mods though, my only problem with the mods is most of them use ridiculously complex graphics which dont match unturneds style at all, and they are usually incredibly overpowered.\nEX: a sniper rifle that can one hit kill you in the foot. So i highly reccomend joining a server with no mods or admins, and dont trust anyone you meet. If you are the kind of player who shows mercy and tries to talk things out, you probobly wont like this.\n\nTLDR\npros:\n-combat\n-survival'n'sheit\n-maps\n\ncons:\n-community\n-mods","August 16, 2014","true","864.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

I love this game so much and I will try to explain why.\n\nI started playing this game when it was in alpha and was a browser game and thats when I stumbled upon the first reason why I love this game.(this was my first time playing after my friend told me to try it) I was just a freshspawn (noob) and I was in the middle of a mountain and I wandered around and found this cool place surrounded by mountains it had weird grey walls, tall towers, and that was all I could really see that was in this "strange" place from where I was standing. When I got closer and took a look I saw a hole in one of the walls, so being the noob I was at the time I rushed to it and without a thought I went in. WORST IDEA EVER. Immediatly after I entered the gap I freaked out when I saw a bunch of faceless flesh eating zombies coming at me, so I thinked fast and ran up the nearest tower and at the top I found a M4 assault rifle and a grenade and being the fool I am I attempted to throw the grenade at the crowd of zombies and instead of blowing up a crowd of flesh hungry zombies I accidentaly hit the side of the tower and it bounced back at me annnnd... Blew myself to smithereens and died instantly. xD I eventually got better at the game after doing tons of stupid things like that but I made it through and im a total pro.... (yup totally.....) but give this game a chance dont rage quit it because you killed yourself or something, learn from it and get better at it. 7.5/10 game!

It is way more fast paced than DayZ because weapon spawns are easier and the map is smaller, and also much simpler than Minecraft, giving you resource respawn nodes, and prefabricated building parts to create your base with. It is very smooth and fun to play, alone or with friends, but like all games much better with friends. I will recommend this game with its block style graphics and RPG like elements because its free and its awesome. The $5 Gold upgrade is well worth the Dollar because it will allow you to level up faster, and join Gold servers while adding a bit of style to your 'used to be nude' new/respawn. The money is well deserved to help the Developer, it goes to an outstanding 16 year old Canadian Developer: Nelson Sexton that made this game himself. Allot of support has been given since the day it was released and has reached Top #3 on most played game on steam.\nGood game. Good Developer. Good price. Good reasons to try the game.","July 18, 2014","true","120.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

After about 2 hours of thinking about the game we decided to add another dude and HOLY ♥♥♥♥. We went 9 hours straight without EVER feeling bored. Not once did I feel the game was grindy, or not challenging. IN this game you need to watch your back. and make sure your friends watch it for you. Where simple things like packing a soda can choose life or death situations. Around 5 hours in we were having so much fun we completly forgot that we were tired and stayed up for 20 hours. This game is so fun and exploration is so great. The only things I want to be added is Bigger map, or more maps. LOTS of more content with better Item placing and options to reset the world. I would also like to have multiple saves/characters. PVP is pretty fun though I didnt mess with it much. Also make the crafting guide easier.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapthecap/recommended/304930/","mapthecap","Mapu Tofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mapthecap/","28 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnturned is a sandbox survival game with RPG mechanics and complex crafting system. If  you're familiar with games such as Rust, The Forest and DayZ there is nothing really ground breaking with Unturned but with a complex crafting system and structure building, Unturned has a bit of an upper hand compared to the rest.\n\nYou may be fooled of the graphics to see this as a casual game(which in my opinion shouldn't be in the genre tags)but Unturned is complex and deep as it's predecessors. You may see this as another Minecraft clone because of the blocky graphics but actually Unturned is more realistic and is more of Rust than Minecraft. You're basically put into a map where you scavenge supplies, collect resources, build a base and survive the coming days, but be cautious as other there are other players, they maybe friendlies or bandits that seek to steal your loot. With this, it gives the game a more DayZ feel as you have to be sneak around that a sniper may shoot your head at any time.\n\nOther than worrying about your own head, there's a complex and deep crafting system that makes almost everything useful, even a moldy vegetable can still be used to make seeds or extra clothes can be used for cloth that can be used for making bandages or even fertilizers and the list goes on and on. Crafting is very essential for building bases and defenses, you can make walls, wooden shields, spikes, barbed wire fences and many more you can use to fortify your defense.\n\nYou also need to gather for food and medicine to keep you healthy. You're given 4 bars, 1 for life, 1 for hunger, 1 for toxicity and 1 for thirst. You can gather food and supplies in town and you can craft bandages for life as well, while medicines, such as vitamins are used to lower your toxicity. You may also want to settle somewhere near a water supply to keep you hydrated. You can also build a farm to have regular food supply.\n\nYou can play solo in single player and play "I am Legend" on your own or you join multiplayer and play "The Walking Dead" with other people. There are a lot of dedicated servers you can join that has regular server resets to maintain upkeep especially when there are many players online. And the most wonderful thing about Unturned, you get everything for free, no strings attached, every last content of the game but there's also a purchasable Permanent(I cannot stress this enough) Gold Status and you can join in gold servers and look cool for the low-low price of $4.99(Keep note: This is not a pay-to-win thing and more of  priority and vanity, which is not bad for the price of a one-time deal)\n\nFor an early access game, the game feels pretty beefy and packed. And to be honest, I haven't really found or met any bugs, or zombies that walk through walls or in a different plane of dimention(ain't pointing any fingers lol.).Unturned is a well polished early access game with regular updates to back it up. You'll definitely have plenty of things to keep you busy, and it's actually a pretty fun experience. To sum it all up, Unturned is basically a free-to-play DayZ with structure building and a complex crafting system. How can you not like that?\n\nbtw. Did I mention it's free?","August 5, 2014","true","43.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaHydra/recommended/304930/","DaHydra","Waga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaHydra/","25 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is a simple zombie survival game, but fun and very action packed. You start out in a big world based on one of the canadian islands, your role is to survive, make a base, and survive the lurking zombies that will be after you. It isn't just a singleplayer survival game, it's also multiplayer! This means that you can also make a base with other players but with the risk of being raided and shot by others. It also has a unique ranking system so you can become the good guy or the bad guy (Bandit or Hero) these depend on what type of player you kill. If you were to kill a bandit you would get good reputation and it would be the oppasite way around if you killed a hero, you would get good reputation. This means people can fear you or want to be with you.\n\nThis game includes a massive variety of things though, including the massive amount of weapons, this varies from guns to melee weapons, then traps too. There are items that allow you to farm, cut down trees and mine stone, this allows you to make a base and prepare for the worst. There are also addons for the guns, armours and also medical supplies to make the game even more interesting. Also weapons can do different damage in different places in the body making it more unique, headshot baby!\n\n9/10 People may find this game quite irratating and hard too.","February 3, 2015","true","205.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PWMW/recommended/304930/","PWMW","Anthony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PWMW/","117 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA ridiculous amount of fun for a free game. Admittedly, I found it pretty difficult at first. As a Minecraft and Terraria player, I'm used to keeping myself alive as not being dire or critical to keep on playing. This game forces you to constantly be out moving and looking for supplies to survive. Once you have enough supplies, equips and weapons, then you're pretty much set and you don't have to worry much anymore. But that first initial burst of necessity as you wash up on shore with nothing (not even clothes) amongst a constant plague of zombies is a lot of fun.\n\nI personally enjoy the scavenging and collecting items. On servers, you can either make friends or make enemies. PvE servers are typically more relaxed and let you hang out with other players. PvP servers tend to be more chaotic and become a mad dash to grab enough weapons and supplies to keep yourself alive from other players.\n\nAll in all, it's an insane amount of content for a game that's free and is constantly being updated to add more content and refine previous content. I was so convinced with the amount of enjoyment I was having with the game that I purchased a Gold account within 3 hours of playing the game. If you're on the fence - don't be. Just give it a shot.
