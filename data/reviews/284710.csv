Never thought I'd care about these hidden object games, to be honest the vast majority of them are tragically primitive. These Artifex Mundi games are not, they're in a class of their own.\n\nThere's a lot of classic adventure elements in them, you find items, figure out how to combine said items to achieve the result you're after and thusly advance the storyline. Every now and then you're confronted with a hidden object scene, a fact that makes my eyes water and kills my inner child bit by bit. In a stroke of pure brilliance they've added an option to play an alternative game and that way bypass the hidden object scene entirely. What you're left with is an adventure game and occasional boardgame challenges, fantastic.\n\nRather uniquely they also tend to feature strong female protagonists that aren't constantly trying to assert the fact that they're female and strong, they just are. This is something that you'd be hard pressed to find in any other genre.\n\nFinally, it works flawlessly in linux. As have all Artifex Mundi games I've tried so far.","April 14, 2014","true","4.6"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","0"

It's a prime example of the quality that Artifex Mundi delivers in this particular genre of games, which can best be defined as a point-and-click adventure light with as an extra ingredient the Hidden Object-screens. Artifex Mundi delivered a really interesting game with this one, which is like an overtly hommage to Bioshock. The setting shows a lot of parallels to that of the famous and revolutionary shooter: just as in Bioshock, I found myself exploring an underwater city where an utopian society had crumbled into tyranny and civil war. Even the art déceau-style of the city is very similar in Abyss to that of Bioshock. It may be a bit too obvious for some, but it's so well done and the screens are so well-drawn and full of details, that for me it felt more a parallel reality, an alternative, to the world of Bioshock than like any sort of plagiate.\n\nIn all possible departments, Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden truly shines. Artifex Mundi invests a lot in putting a convincing story into their Hidden Object-games, and they certainly managed to do so in this game. They also managed to integrate the several hidden object-screens and the mostly cleverly designed puzzles very convincingly into the story. The adventuring-part of the game plays very smoothly and intuitively, helped by the minimal inventory. As far as the musical score and sound-effects are concerned: they do their job in conveying the sometimes scary atmosphere in the game. It would be too much to call this a horror-game, but there are some very rare scaring moments.\n\nBeing a collector's edition, there are quite some neat additions included, such as an extra chapter to the story and some downloadable screens. All in all, this is a very recommendable game. Hidden Object Games-lovers will certainly know that they safely can expect a high level of excellence from this company, but I'd surely recommend it as well to those gamers who haven't yet played this genre before. They may not be difficult or competitve, but certainly entertaining and addictive!\n\nOverall score: 7.5/10","October 28, 2014","true","10.2"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","38","43","0","4"

As a HOG lover, I can most assuredly say that Artifex Mundi has always presented me the best examples of the genre, and Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden is no exception.\n\nThe story is about an underwater city established to seek "Enlightenment", mysterious wraiths called as "legates" taking control over the city, a limited number of survivors forming a resistance against them, and our poor, frustrated main character who is only there to look for her missing husband. Yes, the plot practically screams the Call of Cthulhu meets Bioshock, but the game manages to handle a cliché combination to craft a refreshing setting quite well. As any other Artifex Mundi game, the curtain opens up to an elaborate chaos which could only be sustained by our puzzle solving and item collecting genius.\n\nStory and environment, with well-made artwork as always, are interesting enough to keep you going until you complete the game, which can be said for a select few games in this genre. There is a common formula for crafting HOGs which never fails: pick a mystery, add a missing person or at least a high stake, stir the pot with some HOG scenes and offer a complimentary cheesy ending. In our case, it comes with Artifex Mundi caliber artwork. All checked, we are ready to go!\n\nHidden Object scenes are decent, puzzles are fairly simple and adventure elements are easy to track down with the aid of your map. What I'd like to take a note on, is that item usage and combinations actually makes sense too! Playing dominos as an alternative to Hidden Object scenes is creative and entertaining. Oh, and it is possible to finish the game without the aid of any kind of manual or walkthrough.\n\nIf you like the genre, or maybe the game is on sale, buy it already! It's Artifex Mundi. It basically cannot be bad. If you've played Bioshock, you'll be having a small voice in your head, whispering: "laaaaame", but you'll still play it out of curiosity. You are facing another beyond par HOG, you are welcome!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 25, 2015","true","11.8"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","35","40","0","5"

Although the detailed artwork is clearly inspired by the Bioshock series (and a lot of story elements), it looks great with a colorful palette and some imaginative locations.  There are a lot of areas to explore, as well. The music is very nice and does a good job of setting the mood, but can get a bit repetitive after awhile.\n\nFor the game play, this is your standard IHOG/HOPA, basically adventure game lite with Hidden Object Scenes sprinkled in.  As an adventure gamer myself, I always play on Expert to give me a bit of challenge and lengthen my game experience, but I found the game to be on the easy side overall.  Not a horrible thing if you're looking for a relaxing evening, but I prefer my IHOGs to last longer than 4 hours on the hardest difficulty. Even the puzzles were fairly easy taking me only a few minutes to figure most out, and many needing only a few moves to complete.  The most challenging part for me was going back and finding older Hidden Object Scenes that have reactivated; they don't sparkle in Expert, so it's basically a game of "let's click on everything" in the hopes the scene is indeed active again.  I know this is pretty standard for Expert mode in most HOGs, but honestly, it's just an exercise in frustration, not added challenge.  If the devs are reading this, putting in an option for sparkles on reactivated HOS's would be a much welcome addition in future games.\n\nThe Hidden Object Scenes themselves are well done, nicely drawn items without too much clutter, and have a nice range of difficulty, but none of the items were what I would consider unfairly hidden.  And although I really enjoy HOS's, I know not everyone is a fan, so the option to play Dominos instead is a nice touch.   The Dominos mini-game itself is fun, relaxing and mildly stimulating,\n\nWhile the story took a lot of elements from Bioshock, it didn't resonate with me as much as some of Artifex Mundi's other games.  I know HOG's aren't exactly a great source of deep, thought-provoking storytelling, but I felt like Abyss was flirting with some really interesting concepts, but those ideas kept getting derailed and neutered.\n\nI think my biggest issue came down to the voice acting, though.  Maybe I'm being a little more critical than I should be having come off of a couple of games that had absolutely amazing voice actors, but here...it's just awful.  I wanted so badly to turn off the voices as every time any of the characters uttered something I couldn't help but cringe. If there is anything I would like to see in future HOGs it would be a toggle for the voices.  Sometimes just reading and letting my mind fill in the blanks is better than being stuck with voices that are pulling me out of the experience.\n\nThat said, I did enjoy the game quite a bit and can see myself playing it again in the future.  I certainly look forward to some of Artifex Mundi's other games making their way to Steam.","April 17, 2014","true","9.0"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","35","43","2","0"

Nevertheless I descended into Abyss and its city of Eden, cautious but hopeful that it wouldn't be the stodgy adventure I half expected it to be. Color me surprised then when I became completely swept up in the remarkably high production values, enjoyably casual puzzles, and varied mini-games peppered throughout (heck, there's even some squirrel love). Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden isn't only exceptional for its genre, but a polished and entertaining game in its own right. It's elements may be something less than inspired, but Artifex Mundi mixes them together into far more than the sum of its parts, and certainly one of the best HOGs I've yet to find.\n\nThe obvious influence of Bioshock on Abyss can be seen everywhere, from the narrative of a lone traveler entering an underwater city intended as a bastion of all of humanity's greatest minds and creations, to the neon art deco environments, and the persistent theme of a city that failed under its own ambition. Abyss doesn't pretend to be more than it is though, and actually uses its limited resources to rework the plot of the game it so heavily borrows from into something more manageable, forgoing the heavy questions of morality for a more simplistic ghost story that while nothing remarkable is enough to hold the game together. The iffy voice acting and horrendous facial animation is another matter, but thankfully you are subjugated to these often enough to make you turn the game off in horror.\n\nI call Abyss a HOG, but often it falls far more along the lines of a basic point and click adventure game. You explore locations, picking up objects along the way to help you solve puzzles, with just the occasional mini-game popping up often enough to remind you that you are still playing a HOG (if only in some respects). Personally I enjoy this combination quite a bit more than straight up Highlights, and found the simplicity of the puzzles oddly satisfying. It doesn't require much thought and there's always a hint button if you should get stuck, but it also doesn't treat you like a complete imbecile, requiring just enough from the player to keep from feeling like an interactive slideshow.\n\nIf you have been turned off from HOGs in the past from their lackluster presentations, mind numbing stories, or over reliance on the sole act of finding hidden objects, I'd suggest you take a look at Abyss before writing the genre off entirely. Its visuals are top notch, the gameplay at just the right level of casual friendliness without becoming tediously easy, and the whole experience feels like its operating a far higher budget with a better development team than I've come to expect from this sort of game. Let's just say I'm impressed, Artifex Mundi; here's hoping this is a sign of the quality we can expect going forward from one of my favorite gaming guilty pleasures.","July 4, 2014","true","5.5"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","1"

If not, grab your mouse and relax: the ride is thrilling and wonderful.\nThere is usually some curse or supernatural element involved in their games and Abyss (the hidden object game version of Bioshock) is no exception. As you travel in a ruined underground city that aspired to be a beacon of freedom and enlightenment, you face and have to overcome mysterious adversaries that look like demon-eyed Wraiths in order to free your beloved (and also save the few free people that were left, some tired bloke pushing his forties and about three kids).\nIt turns out that the cause for all this is Cthulhu, or rather a strange statue found deep inside a mining shaft at the bottom of the ocean, depicting a humanoid body with the head of an octopus. Sounds familiar? I hope so.\nAt this point I am sure that Artifex Mundi have a Cthulhu and Cthulhu-mythos obsession and I love them for it (Cthulhu statue in Abyss, fishmen in nightmares from the deep: siren's call and the Necronomicon in 9 clues:the secret of serpent creek).\nThe avatars in this installment have really stepped up their game, the faces are life-like which is mostly due to the vivacity of the eyes and that is a delight to watch - although I also enjoy their painterly ones in other games.\nThe shock value of corpses showing up everywhere is also thrilling and adds to the unsettling atmosphere of Abyss, making it just the right amount of creepy.\n\nTL;DR: *Cthulhu possesses underwater city people and tries to expand his empire.\n*Explosions!\n*Giant octopi!\n*Dinosaur skeletons!\n*Corpses!

As for the rest, it's a point and click adventure game interspersed with set-piece puzzles and hidden object challenges. The artwork is very good, the character animation is pretty dated, the puzzles are mostly fairly undemanding although there's the occasional headscratcher (usually due to missing a vital clue or scene somewhere, so you'll need to search the entire map at times), good music and - as usual with these games - truly dire voice acting.

I played a free-to-play hidden object game years ago and remembered liking it well enough. I love finding things in games. Anything. Collectibles, secret areas, shinies, etc. Heck, I love searching for and finding things in real life, too. I'm a married woman and I still insist on my mother hiding my Easter basket every year. I'm not sure what's sadder; that my mother actually listens to me and hides my basket every year, or that she still gives me one at all.\n\nNonetheless, thanks to the Steam queue, I have been introduced to the genre yet again. I purchased a few on a whim one day, and Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden was the first I played. I was in a casual game type of mood after putting much thought and effort into a lengthy RPG, and this game was really enjoyable in that respect.\n\nThe game opens up with your character's voice laying out the prologue to the story, and it made me giggle a bit because she sounded like a generic Microsoft computer voice at first. While the environments in this are beautiful and colorful, the entire game has a type of B-movie feel, with iffy voice actors, a "meh" story, and no sense of danger at all. The game definitely tries to throw some creepy moments at you, but never did I feel like my character was in danger or that a save would need to be reloaded. The game isn't scary at all for adults, but for young kids, it might be sufficiently creepy on rare occasions (and this game is definitely E-rated).\n\nAbyss surprised me in that the game, while in the Hidden Object genre, was not overflowing with hidden object puzzles. I saw one review mention there were too many of them, but I wished for more. The game relies on an exceptionally well done and intelligently designed point and click adventure model for most of the gameplay, and the hidden object screens are mostly a distraction that include an object or two that you'll need to take from the hidden object puzzle and insert into the story gameplay. Sprinkled throughout the game there are also various mini-puzzles that go from sliding puzzles to jigsaw types to wire connecting puzzles. Not once did I feel like a puzzle was out of place or overly complicated. Even if (say, for kids) a puzzle is too confusing or hard, you can skip it. The game encourages you not to via some unlockable achievements, but it is an option. Unlike many point and click games, I never felt like combining objects to meet a goal was unnecessarily complicated. All of them made sense, so this game never frustrates.\n\nOverall, while I did wish for more hidden object puzzles, I felt like Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden surprised me in its quality. It's relaxing and takes you on a nice little journey over about a four hour playthrough (I played on Expert despite being fairly new to the genre and never once was frustrated, so it's definitely casual!). While I would personally advise you to wait for a sale because I go by the $1.00 per hour of gameplay rule, I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual romp through some pretty environments. I'm giving this a 7/10. This is a great game for kids or for adults looking for a shorter game with little commitment. I was pleasantly surprised with this game, and I now consider myself a fan of the Hidden Object genre.","March 26, 2015","true","4.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","10","11","4","7"

(Though Pandora was not the one who opened the box this time.)\n\nStoryline: Marine explorer Robert stumbles upon an underwater city.  Before being able to report his finding he is taken captive by a mysterious entity with glowing red eyes in a black robe.  After not returning from his dive, his female companion sets out to find him.  She follows his underwater trail to the underwater city of Eden.  Once inside she discovers the ruins of a once magnificent underwater utopian metropolis build to seek harmony and peace.  Her mission: Find Robert and along the way she discovers there are others still alive in this decaying city.  Some are survivors, some are rebels, and some are possessed.  Second mission: Escape.   (Any more storyline would spoil the mystery and adventure.)\n\nReveiwers have blasted this game (circa 2012) for various things but the biggest complaint seems to be is it is a rip-off of Bioshock.  I have never played Bioshock so for me it was fresh and I did not compare two entirely different types of games with entirely different storyline concepts.  Besides anything written about any underwater utopia, if one wants to get technical, is a rip-off of Jules Verne's "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" and "Mysterious Island" or even Dr. No (the movie) of the James Bond franchise originally authored by Ian Fleming.\n\nGameplay: Beyond the jump scares and the death count, (both of which should be expected due to what occurred in the storyline), the game plays in a sectional linear fashion with a find and use inventory that needs to be completed before being able to move into the next section/area.  The storyline is revealed through discovery as the gamer explores the complex.  Generally there is little backtracking but some items found in some areas can not be used until later in the game.  (So if playing on expert mode remember where there are.)   The Hidden Object scenes are scattered throughout and for the most part are only played once.  There are several times where the same scene is played twice but generally only after the gamer has progressed the storyline.  Certain Hidden Object scenes (generally a replay scene) and certain items only show up after the game progresses.  If stuck in an area that means something has not been done yet.\n\nThere is a lot of point and click hunt, find and solve to this game.  In my opinion this game leans toward point and click with Hidden Object finds as a secondary.  Which oddly enough works well with the storyline.  The same can be said for the puzzles, despite how random they seem.  The puzzles overall are fairly easy to solve and the usual fare.  However the puzzles work well for where they are, what needs to be done, and how they fit into the storyline.  So overall the continuity remains pretty much in tact.\n\nFinal note:  In Artifex Mundi tradition, the Hidden Object scenes can be played with an alternative game.  In this case, it is dominoes.  Added 12/12/2015:  Here is a trick to getting the 1 minute time in the dominoes game: Play the Hidden Object scene as List find.  Play until only one List find clue is left then switch to the dominoes game.  Finish the dominoes game and walla achievement earned.\n\nOverall, I liked the tight well-written storyline, which though a bit far-fetched is no better or worse then most "sci-fi horror" flicks, shows or books.  Oh last thing, there is a rather awkward proposal of marriage at the end which I thought I should mention being such a rare occurence in any game and gives this game a very personal touch.","October 28, 2015","true","9.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

While the story may not seem original, very Bioshock -esque, the story itself is good enough to keep you interested and also differs enough from Bioshock to keep it entertaining.  The graphics are beautiful with great animations and cut-scenes.  The puzzles can range from super simple to somewhat difficult.  The hidden object games aren't the most difficult that I've seen, but at least offer enough variety of objects to choose from that it's above par compared to other games of the genre.\n\nOverall, this is one of the top of its kind, so definitely worth the play through.","April 13, 2015","true","9.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Things quickly become tricky as the city appears to be deserted save for a ghost (or group of ghosts) as well as a pretty creepy little girl.\nOn the actual game side of it you have point & click adventure game style playing, where you navigate a series of screens and gather objects to manipulate the environment (open doors, fix machinery, feed squirrels, etc.) which in some way helps you along.\nGathering some (but not all) of these objects requires a mini-game. This mini-game is either the standard hidden object gameplay or a simple but entertaining enough domino-stone based puzzle. The awesome part, as with Nightmares from the Deep, is that the choice which mini-game to play is completely left to the player and can be switched at any time.\n\nThe elephant in the room, something the other reviews undoubtedly also go into, is that this isn't the first game set in a weird, creepy under water city that has fallen into disarray where creepy girls walk around. The (excellent) game Bioshock had a very similar setting, and it's very unlikely that the developers of Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden didn't at least take some inspiration from Bioshock. I personally didn't mind, but it might irk you if you're a fan of Bioshock I guess.\n\nAll in all this is a solid hidden object game. Don't expect anything ground breaking, but if you are looking for a little casual adventure this is a solid choice.","September 1, 2014","true","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A definite grab if you like this genre.\n\nLong version:There are hidden object games that try to ascend the limits of their genre to stand out. Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden chose to be good in the known game elements instead.\n\nAlthough the story is just a mishmash of Bioshock and Cthulhu, it is an almost perfect mixture. It is engaging, features genuinely good twists, and has a realistic, interesting main character. The only real downside is the voice acting, it is spectacularly bad even by hidden object standards.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are spread out evenly and offer a steady progression. They require a fair amount of backtracking, but the map design doesn’t make you feel like you are walking around endlessly. The hidden object scenes are drawn well, although they have a few problems, especially if the required item is in the water.\n\nI also have to mention the bonus chapter: not only it gives you great insight of the main story, but it even puts one of the side characters in the limelight, adding even more depth to the game.","November 18, 2014","true","6.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/284710/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2216 products in account","Hidden object games are somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me.  I am quite fascinated with them, but generally balk at the idea of ever spending money on them (and there's admittedly no logic to this stance - it's just how it is).  So it was that Abyss (and its predecessor, Nightmares from the Deep) were picked up in bundles along with other games I actually wanted.  But hey, here was my first chance to play a commercial HOG as opposed to all the free ones I've tried on the web and they're actually pretty good.  I played Nightmares first and you can read my review of it here:  http://steamcommunity.com//id/dunetiger/recommended/259740/\n\nSo we come to Abyss: the Wraiths of Eden, a casual hidden-object/adventure game unashamedly inspired by and liberally borrowed from Bioshock.  At first, I dismissed the comparisons and thought they were simply tongue-in-cheek comments, but the truth is there is no denying Bioshock's influence on this game.  The story is this: your husband (you play a lady once again) has gone missing on a diving expedition and you're trying to track him down.  You end up in a strange submerged city called Eden (-not- Rapture), solving puzzles to defeat the forces of evil.  Pretty standard stuff.\n\nCompared with Nightmares from the Deep, you now have high-res (720) cutscenes so no more fuzzies when they come up, but character models continue to be creepy and not purposely so.  Like Bioshock, there are little girls running around although they're not zombie creatures being followed by big dudes in diving suits, so at least the comparisons can end there, but I bring them up because they are REALLY weird looking.  I know it's not easy to model faces, but man....\n\nAnyways, the format of the game is pretty much exactly like Nightmares from the Deep, but with a few minor differences.  Like its predecessor, Abyss is filled not just with HOG scenes (I think there's 16 of them to do in total), but also various find-object, use-object puzzles and a few brain teasers, but nothing really difficult.  On expert mode, nothing is pointed out to you and some areas will become pixel hunts; however, if you are playing with children, you might want to lower the difficulty where the game will be a little more forgiving with keeping the pace going.  Where Nightmares had the alternative of mahjong tile matching instead of playing the HOG, Abyss offers as its alternative a weird, but enjoyable domino-style game where you need to lay down dominoes in order to cover icons on a grid.  You're not REALLY playing dominoes, so it's more of a picture-matching exercise than anything else... just like "mahjong".\n\nOther than that, the puzzles here are a little more clever than in Nightmares, and the only word of warning is there are some 'frightening' images that may not be appropriate for younger children.  Although I preferred the theme and story of Nightmares, Abyss is a fine casual game and can be enjoyed by anyone.\n\nThe only thing I really disliked in this game was the friggin elevator.","May 4, 2014","true","4.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The graphics are fairly nice, the story is trite but adequate, the voice acting is mostly tolerable, the puzzles enjoyable, and the Steam Achievements a bit irritating.  If you've played any Artifex Mundi HOGS, there's nothing unexpected.  Really, the only minor negatives are those Steam Achievements:  the HOG and the Dominoes Achievements are mutually exclusive.  So, to get 100% Achievements, you're forced to do two run-throughs.  And, as usual, since there are no saves, if you mess up, you have to finish that run-through regardless and then do it again.  One thing to point out with this game (like a lot of these HOGs) is that it's old enough that the user profile is not saved in the Steam folders or even in the standard Saved Games folder.  Instead, it's saved in the hidden folder [username]\AppData\Roaming\ArtifexMundi\Abyss_TheWraithsOfEden\CE.  So, if you're worried about losing it, make sure you back that up.\n\nI got about 9.6 hours of good game play out of the game (6.5 hours for the first run-through with the Bonus Chapter and another 3.1 hours for the second run-through).  So, even at it's list price, the game is close to being worth it.  Of course, if you can find it on sale (as I did), then go ahead and snap it up.","July 30, 2015","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hand icon you usually take or grab items (when "grabbing" you don't take them but can use them to interact with other items). These are the interactions that make sense, and little minigames where you solve puzzles to open a secret lock or something, that makes sense too.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense is that throughout the game you will encounter a type of minigame that's just stupid in context, it's one of those "screens full of garbage" and that you have to find a certain amount of items. This doesn't make sense for a lot of reasons: Firstly, the purpose of finding all of those items is so that you get ONE of those items to use, for example, if you need a handle, you can find the handle in the minigame but you still have to find a whale, a box of crayons, a fedora, 3 lollypops, etc. JUST to get to keep the handle.\n\nAlso worse than that, some items aren't even there, you have to "make" them. An example of this is in a part where you need a "Dotted tie"... however the only tie there is 1 solid color... what do you have to do? Grab a crayon and click the tie, you will then draw dots on the tie and THEN you can get it. I know it's supposed to entertain the player a bit but it's just stupid! Specially most of those item combinations! Oh yeah, and many of the items you need aren't even items, they can be drawings or something like that... so yeah...\n\nHowever, if you don't want to do that minigame and look for everything you can do a domino game instead, there will be a big grid with some 2x2 trees scattered about, when you get a domino piece to touch one of them it's the same as finding an item in the other minigame. You get 3 dominoes and you can flip them however you like. There is also a handle on the left that changes the 3 dominoes you have in case you can't use them or want something different.\nAny combination of finding objects or playing the dominoes is fine, nothing changes really.\n\nYou cannot combine items in your inventory also, so don't worry about that.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game however is that it is very very linear, and if that wasn't enough, you even have a map that always tells you where you should go next, sure, if you have a good memory you don't even need that map, but it still looks a bit too much hand-holding (although you only open the map if and when you want it).\n\nAnother thing that makes the game much worse is the voice acting, SERIOUSLY! Specially the protagonist, she looks like she has no emotion, a monster can appear right in front of her face and she's all like "Oh, what is this?" like she doesn't even care.\n\nOn the aesthetic side, the game is actually quite well drawn and animated, there's a thing here or there but in general the looks of everything really fit well with each other and are gorgeous... HOWEVER! This is not the case for when someone talks to you!\n\nEven though the characters look very well made (could be better in some cases but still), when they start talking it's just horrible and makes you want to look the other way, the ONLY thing that moves is the mouth, they don't even blink unless it's part of a cinematic speech, just the mouth moves and on top of that the mouth only has like 4 different poses, each stays there for almost a second and looks REALLY unnatural, it would look a lot better if they didn't move the mouth at all.\n\n\nBut all in all, it's a decent game if you're not looking for a hardcore point and click and just want to finish one, it doesn't take too long to finish and it's almost impossible to get stuff (even if you never use the "skip" or "hint" buttons).\n\n\nSo play this game if:\n- You just want to casually play a point and click game;\n- Want to look at some pretty sceneries;\n- Do random stuff that make no sense whatsoever in context.\n\nDo NOT play this game if:\n- You want a good story with awesome voice acting;\n- You want a challenging point and click where you have to figure out what to do by yourself;\n- Want a deep and engaging story;\n- Want to see realistic facial expressions.\n\n\nSo that about wraps my review, from 0 to 10 I think I enjoyed this game about 5... wasn't that good but wasn't that bad either, just enough to keep me going, but just because I wanted to try it out... took me about 2:30 hours to beat this game.\n\n\nOh, and the ending was the most stupid thing ever xD","September 1, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you would like to see my other review, please follow this link: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197979162305/recommended/284870/\n\nThe overall meta of this game is similar to the last one. It's a casual point and click adventure with find the items in a big pile mini games. Compared to the last one I felt that this one was slightly harder which is good but I still managed to finish it in less than 4 hours. I would again recommend that you play it on Expert mode because it is a very easy game really.\nThis one I enjoyed quite a bit more than the last one. I have no idea if this one is chronologically older than the first but the production values seem to be much higher this time. The characters have some wonderful 3d modeling and very nice animations.\n\nI wonder if the main character is supposed to be the same? She uses the same voice actress at the very least. I wonder if it is, I think that if it is she must be one of the most unlucky person in the world! Unlike having the ungodly detective powers of the first, there is a bit more MacGyvering this time around. This feels a little more realistic and I do appreciate it.\nThe game had a couple of jump scares that got me so well done with that :) The last one didn't manage at all.\n\nIf I had to complain I would say the music got really repetative really quickly and I ended up turning it off after an hour or so and listened to my own MP3s.  Your milage may vary on that.\n\nI don't want to say too much as a point and click game is all about the story and its hard to talk about it without spoiling anything however its a nice story line and your character is fun to play as. It's nice to see more games where you get to play as a female that isn't there purely for fan service.\n\nI feel that this game deserves a very well earned 7/10!\n\nIt's short and sweet but its very high quality and if you like point and click games I think you should consider buying it!\n\nIs this an overall better product than Serpent Creek? Maybe....I am not suffering as much from the dysphoria today so maybe that put me in an overall better mood. Frankley I am happy to have played and experienced them both however :)\n\nThis is a nice little studio, I think I would consider myself a fan and I will hopefully get a chance to play some of their other games soon!","September 20, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are fairly nice, the story is trite but adequate, the voice acting is mostly tolerable, the puzzles enjoyable, and the Steam Achievements a bit irritating.  If you've played any Artifex Mundi HOGS, there's nothing unexpected.  Really, the only minor negatives are those Steam Achievements:  the HOG and the Dominoes Achievements are mutually exclusive.  So, to get 100% Achievements, you're forced to do two run-throughs.  And, as usual, since there are no saves, if you mess up, you have to finish that run-through regardless and then do it again.  One thing to point out with this game (like a lot of these HOGs) is that it's old enough that the user profile is not saved in the Steam folders or even in the standard Saved Games folder.  Instead, it's saved in the hidden folder [username]\AppData\Roaming\ArtifexMundi\Abyss_TheWraithsOfEden\CE.  So, if you're worried about losing it, make sure you back that up.\n\nI got about 9.6 hours of good game play out of the game (6.5 hours for the first run-through with the Bonus Chapter and another 3.1 hours for the second run-through).  So, even at it's list price, the game is close to being worth it.  Of course, if you can find it on sale (as I did), then go ahead and snap it up.","July 30, 2015","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one mashes up a bit of the Mythos with a whole lotta Bioshock, for a story in which you head out to rescue your undersea-explorer husband who has gone missing.  You dive at his last known location and find first a broken-down lab, and then a stark, sprawling, deserted city on the sea bottom.\n\nThe city is called Eden, not Rapture, but the principles are the same, and the explorations and puzzles that follow are tricky enough to be interesting and pliant enough to cave under pressure.  NOTE that the "Hint" button becomes a "Skip" button during puzzles, so if you are paying the wrong kind of attention, trying to figure out what the puzzle rules are can turn into a whoops-skip (this happened to me twice).","October 27, 2014","true","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The amount of detail and color gives the underwater environment, as well as the ruined city, a mixture of wonder, destitution and haunting, telling the tale of a once wonderful city reduced to ruins. While it may remind you of Bioshock, the game's enviroment is still totally unique in my opinion.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the Hidden Object gameplay never gets boring. It has two kinds of objects: one where you click on the correct one, and poof! Item found, while the second one has you find an item to open/reveal another before it is considered found, and done. This added a little bit of challenge and variety to the otherwise simple Hidden Object Scene.\n\nTired of Hidden Objects? Switch it to Dominoes, where you will have to place the tile to reach the seashells to complete the game. Pretty simple, except that you must align the tiles correctly to move forward.\n\nAlso other than those two above are the puzzles. While most are actually a piece of cake, some are really challenging. The puzzle design, as all I can say, well made.\n\nThe story, although it overall looked simple, doesn't mean it can't hook you up to this game. Though low-quality cutscenes sucked some beauty away from the story, it can still be interesting due to the mystery surrounding the sunken city. Voice acting is also top notch, as you can feel whatever they said, they really mean it. That is a redemption for the low-quality cutscenes at least.\n\nOverall, I love this game. Though the characters aren't really memorable, the game's environment and gameplay makes this game unqiue compared to other Point-and-click games. The Collector's Edition also added other goodies (such as musics, and wallpapers) as well as an extra mission to understand how the city came to be.\n\nFor the price tag of $7.99, it was totally worth it.","August 11, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was pretty well voice acted, the difficulty wasn't too great, even on expert, but not a walk in the park either. The Dominos minigame was a neat and fun addition in lieu of doing the hidden object puzzles, the story was interesting although unfortunately left us wanting more, and the game itself flowed well and was very nice to look at.\n\nI only have two complaints really about Abyss. First, the lack of backstory on the cool Rapture-like place called Eden that is used as the backdrop for the game. Second, that I tried to start the game on expert so I'd only have to play through once. Why complain? Well, I managed to get myself stuck a couple times, and after exhausting all possible options, I went to the internet.\n\nEvery single time it was because I missed clicking on something I had already interacted with that was now useable a second time. Now that it was able to be interact with them again, they would give me an item I could then use to progress. Mostly my own fault, but I felt this was counterintuitive, as I had already eliminated these objects from use.\n\nI enjoyed it enough that I played the bonus (check it out from the extras menu for a little more story) AND I'm going back through again on easy so I can get the Dominos achievement :) Highly recommend if you are a fan of class-B point-and-click games. From this experience, I will definitely buy all Artifex Mundi games going forward. They have a different feel from any other point-and-clicks. They stand out as higher quality, and more fun to play.

Now you may raise your eyebrows when I mention "Bioshock" and "HOG" in the same sentence but this game takes place in an underwater city meant to be a self sufficient utopia. Yeah, the devs had Rapture in mind when they made this but that's not a bad thing as I enjoy that early century art deco look. The story was okay. The voice acting was not. Gameplay was your typical mini-games with hidden object goodness, none of which was too difficult which I liked. The one thing I didn't like was that there is a ton of back tracking. Get this object from here, take it over there and use it on this thing only to go back to where you got it from. Blah. Thankfully there aren't TOO many areas so you won't forget what was where. You can finish the main game and the bonus story in about 4 hours so th length is just right. Oh, and if you don't want to play the hidden object part there's an alternate mah-jong game which is also fun and a nice change. Overall I give this game an 8/10.

In addition to hidden object style minigames, there are also various renditions of other minigames like pattern matching, hit every location only once to move your token, as well as some very basic point and click adventure mechanics.\n\nOn the flipside, the music is repetitive, it has no replay value once you've beaten it unless you HAVE to get every achievement, facial animations are weird, character animations are just ok (for about 8 years ago), and the dialogue and voice acting sounds like it was written and performed by a high school amateur troop.

There is a hint system, although you most likely won't need it, and you can always choose to substitute a game of dominos if you get stuck.  They also use common English/British synonyms for all of the item names (which may sound like a minor point, but is a big deal for those of us who have played other HOGs where a "fishnet" could be labeled as a "landing," or where items are randomly in a foreign language for no reason).\n\nAs for the mini-games, they are intuitive and fairly easy, and never feel tedious or like filler.  Instead, you feel a sense of accomplishment, as each mini-game serves to advance the plot in some way.\n\nAdditionally, the point-and-click puzzles are logical.  It was always pretty obvious what an item was going to be used for, so there was never any sense of frustration.  If for some reason you aren't sure of where to go next, though, your map (on the easier difficulties) will show you where you can perform actions.  Experienced gamers will not find this game challenging, even on the highest difficulty rating, but it is worth playing through anyway just to experience the setting and the craftsmanship of the gameplay.  I played through multiple times in one day so I could get all of the achievements, and it never got old.\n\nThe voice acting is top-notch, the music provides just the right amount of creepiness or action, the backgrounds are beautiful, and even the CG people aren't horrible to look at.\n\nThe game is fairly short, less than 3 hours, but there is an optional bonus mission that adds depth and backstory to the characters.  Also, while there is a fair amount of backtracking, they make it feel fresh by having many areas change visually upon revisiting them.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game a 9.5/10, and feel it is worth the full $7.99.  It is far superior to any other HOG I have played.","August 17, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I suppose this is to be expected from this genre, which is a new one to me.  The story is adequately suspenseful, though predictable.  I found the wordplay involving the hidden object games amusing and often clever.  The one problem I have with the game, and this is near a deal breaker for me, to be the voice acting of the main character.  Her tone constantly seems overly cheerful or questioning, and the voice itself has almost no character or depth to it.  At one point, when she encounters a sea ghost, the last of whose kind imprisoned and then attempted to murder her, she exclaims, in a flirty quip, "What's your game?"  His game is to kill you!  Why aren't you scared?  This would only be a minor fault, where it not for the fact that this robo-woman is tasked with half of the dialogue in the game.  In the end, I was forced to add my own excitement to the character.  Picturing her as a lovesick psychopath, intent on gaining the pleasure of killing her beloved Robert for herself, she wanders an abandoned sea-station, laughing at the impotent attempts of sea-ghosts to scare her.

The storyline at least is somewhat different from its thematic inspiration, so it doesn't feel like a complete retread.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the HOG scenes all play fine, and the puzzles were also pretty good - a reasonable mix and a moderate difficulty in most cases, and the point and click sections in between it all works well enough, nothing too illogical or jarring, and of course the HOG genre fits quite well into this semi-apocalyptic scenario of scavenging around for tools and clues as to what is happening. An alternative to playing the HOG scenes - dominos - is available, although it is pretty bland, and it seems a bit odd when these sorts of things are provided, as it seems unlikely there is big market of people that would play a HOG if the HOG scenes weren't there, as they tend to make pretty weak point and click puzzlers with this part taken away.\n\nAs has been mentioned in other reviews, one of the weaknesses here is the animations when characters are talking to you which makes them look like mannequins (although due to they story in a few cases this is somewhat appropriate), which is a bit jarring. Another minor issue is that the achievements are set up so you have to play the game twice - once doing only HOG scenes, once playing Dominos at each such scene, in order to get 100%.\n\nHowever in summary this is a well made, if derivative, game that is easy to play, mildly challenging in places, and with an okay storyline and atmosphere.","August 31, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles are good. Graphics are solid for this genre. Locations are really interesting. It's an underwater city. I was waiting for a Big Daddy to drill me to death at any moment!\n\nEverything is easily identified, but not easy to find. All the puzzles require you to use some objects in the scene to uncover others.

Most of the time, the rest is fun too though. As is the case here.\n\nI played this through a while ago, but not the bonus adventure yet, and wasn't much bothered by achievements. Now I replayed it for those two things. I enjoyed it the first time and had fun a 2nd (and will for a 3rd - for Domino) time. During the 2nd play-through I noticed that the hidden objects in the various scenes change in each play-through. Nice touch.\n\nThe hidden object games are just right for my taste (medium difficulty), the story is intriguing. The colourful places have something that really appeals to me.\n\nThe puzzles and the Domino as alternative to the hidden object games are fun to do.\n\nI'd have liked an option to jump around on the map as is possible in some of the other games by Artifex Mundi.\n\nIt's a shame that the achievements for all hidden object/all Domino games can't be done via the extras, and needs a 2nd play through. On the other hand, as I said the story and the puzzles are fun, so I'll enjoy doing the replay twice even.\n\nThere are few games where I don't turn the music off first thing, so I can't say anthing about that.\n","June 5, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A bit darker than the usual HOG. The game has a lot of jumpscares.\n\nYou play a woman (whose name does not come up in the game iirc) trying to find her fiancee who went missing at sea while diving.  When following his footsteps she discovers a mysterious underwater city.\n\nThe art is beautiful and the music is good. The puzzles, I found, were either a bit too easy with a few exceptions with "wtf am I doing -spamclick until it works-". The game has 3 difficulty levels, the lowest difficulty shows actions availible on the ingame map and everything useful in the world sparkles. On the hardest no availables are shown and there is no sparkle.\n\nThere is an achievement for not using hints in the HO scenes, but for progressing in the world the hint button is near spammable. As an option instead of the HO scenes this game has a domino game you can do. To get all the achievements in the game you have to go through the game twice; once playing hidden objects and once with dominos. My playtime is one game on hardest difficulty and HO scenes and once with skipping absolutely everything and speeding it.\n\nPretty much all cutscenes and dialogues are skippable. The map has no teleport option and is mostly useless on the harder modes as you're unlikely to be lost. The story is good,, though I wish you learned more about the world in the game.\n\nThe game is the Collector's edition by default, so it has an extra chapter when you're done with the game as well as wallpapers, music etc. Small nuisance of how the opening cutscene to the game starts playing every time you open it, before the main menu, but as it's skippable it's not a big problem. I encountered no bugs and the game ran smoothly. As tends to be with this company the animation cutscenes is the least impressive part of the game, but still they're not terrible.","June 3, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does have some nice scenery when walking around the underwater city, but once it switches to a Hidden Object Scene, it's noticeably uglier. The HO scenes are also fewer and farther between, and they're over with too quickly. The bonus chapter is ridiculously short. Yeah, I know, it's just a bonus, but Alex Hunter's bonus was almost as long as the main game. The plus side is that there are a lot of puzzles to solve, but many of them are similar to puzzles in other games of these types (and in at least one case, exactly identical). The human models are some of the most terrifying I've ever seen, and there's a weird, inconsistent blend of hand-drawn art with CG art. Also, constantly having to go up and down an elevator with no way to skip the animation was really annoying.\n\nUnlike Alex Hunter, it has achievements and trading cards, so if that's important to you, it's the only thing it really has over it. So, no, I can't give a strong recommendation unless you just can't get enough of these types of games.\nRating: 2/5","September 8, 2014","false","8.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The biggest difference is that if you don't like hidden object finds, you can instead click on a set of three dominoes and play dominoes instead where the hidden object puzzles are. The dominoe puzzles are easy and impossible to fail even for a deliquent, drunk and blindfolded. In fact it was so easy i'm not actually sure why they would put it in there as it seems almost a waste of time.\n\nStory is all over the place just a rushed quick cash grab concoction. Some experimental underwater city called Eden was made. Eventually the peaceful city becomes traumatised by legates, ghostly dark hooded grim reaper high priest style dressed beings that float around the place. Half way in the game you find that the legates all listen to the dark lord which I assume is satan and they tie people up in trees and possess them for no reason what so ever.\n\nIn the end you approach the dark lord with a golden arrow, he grabs it off you and breaks it and throws it back at you. You put it back together and stick it in him... he dies. Never knew Satan was such a dumb dumb.\n\nI must say I didn't really appreciate the nonsensical supernatural theme running throughout and made the game just feel like a cheap cash in.\n\nWhile the music and sounds are great and there are enough cheap scares in this to have you spitting your crisps your eating at the monitor at various locations. (Turn sound up) The voice acting and some of the dialogues are so cheesy and poorly done youll be uncontrollably head shaking like your at a rock concert.\n\nFor achievement hunters place the game on easy and DO NOT HIT HINT BUTTON that will at least save you from two more walk throughs. Unfortunately you will have to play through again playing dominoes instead. Play each Hidden Object map leaving the last object of each map unfound and just hit the dominoe set to finish of each map on a single dominoe. This is the quickest way to get 100%.\n\nNice animation, music and sound. Terrible, poorly done story with hidden supernatural themes (skip button was welcoming here). Game is no where near worth $10.00.\n\nSo devs what are you going to rip off next? Borderlands? Alien Isolation?

The biggest difference is that if you don't like hidden object finds, you can instead click on a set of three dominoes and play dominoes instead where the hidden object puzzles are. The dominoe puzzles are easy and impossible to fail even for a deliquent, drunk and blindfolded. In fact it was so easy i'm not actually sure why they would put it in there as it seems almost a waste of time.\n\nStory is all over the place just a rushed quick cash grab concoction. Some experimental underwater city called Eden was made. Eventually the peaceful city becomes traumatised by legates, ghostly dark hooded grim reaper high priest style dressed beings that float around the place. Half way in the game you find that the legates all listen to the dark lord which I assume is satan and they tie people up in trees and possess them for no reason what so ever.\n\nIn the end you approach the dark lord with a golden arrow, he grabs it off you and breaks it and throws it back at you. You put it back together and stick it in him... he dies. Never knew Satan was such a dumb dumb.\n\nI must say I didn't really appreciate the nonsensical supernatural theme running throughout and made the game just feel like a cheap cash in.\n\nWhile the music and sounds are great and there are enough cheap scares in this to have you spitting your crisps your eating at the monitor at various locations. (Turn sound up) The voice acting and some of the dialogues are so cheesy and poorly done youll be uncontrollably head shaking like your at a rock concert.\n\nFor achievement hunters place the game on easy and DO NOT HIT HINT BUTTON that will at least save you from two more walk throughs. Unfortunately you will have to play through again playing dominoes instead. Play each Hidden Object map leaving the last object of each map unfound and just hit the dominoe set to finish of each map on a single dominoe. This is the quickest way to get 100%.\n\nNice animation, music and sound. Terrible, poorly done story with hidden supernatural themes (skip button was welcoming here). Game is no where near worth $10.00.\n\nSo devs what are you going to rip off next? Borderlands? Alien Isolation?

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.\n\nThat's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.\n\nThey do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.\n\nMy recommendation, because of the "if you've played one you've played them all" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.","August 12, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hidden Object games are a fun casual experience from time to time. My porblem with the endless flood of these things on steam is that they aren't very good. The art is nice (barring the characters themselves) and the object finding is good enough but each game lacks anything to make it stand out from the others.\n\nThe best Hidden Object games in my mind remain the I-Spy ones, Treasure Hunt and Haunted House inparticular. They had simple goals but they were fun to pursue. Each Hidden object was a good time and clicking on things made them move and made a simple game that much more entertaining. In this game everything just fades out of existence when you click on it. This makes each puzzle a chore instead of an experience.\n\nThe I-Spy games were also made or kids in mind so the goals were pretty simple, escape the house, find the treasure etc. However these were fun and relatable in the sense that they were likely things kids imagined on their own. These games opt for some overly complex bullcrap story with no real substance whatsoever. They opt to have characters with backstories and what not and still every one of them feels and sounds entirely disinterested at all times.\n\nThe other big problem I have here is backtracking. Sending the player allover this needlessly large enviroment to either pick up loose objects or do the same hidden object puzzles with different items to find. In I-Spy backtracking was done once at the end of the game to find hidden clues inside each puzzle that linked together. This was a really cool reason to backtrack because it meant the treasure, key, whatever had been in plain sight all along. Here its just anohter chore to get another item so i can proceed to go to another puzzle.\n\nPlus as far as this story goes... I deeated the dumb evil sea monster by literally messing up his drawing on the floor. That's what we call a payoff right there.","September 21, 2015","false","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There are some significant caveats, but on the whole, it's still a bit more "no" than "yes".\n\nThe game is standard fare HOG/adventure, which, true, aren't that much represented on Steam (currently), but the simple truth is - I've seen some much better.\n\nEverything just smells of laziness. Lazy graphic, lazy animations, lazy story, which, without even batting an eyelash is heavily ripping of Bioshock, lazy puzzle design, lazy minigames. It's not that it is bad, it's just not good enough. It's not that it's full of glitches, or has technical problems, it's just - lazy.\n\nStory is Bioshock with a cthulhu twist (and without *that one* twist). As said, many of 'shock's tropes are present. I'd say uncomfortably many - underwater grand city, but which has gone wrong, but whose magnificent glass domes still function, are full of air and warmth and haven't somehow collapsed, even though there are explosions, earthquakes, etc. in the game; then we have jump scare shocks; ominous monsters; dirtiness superimposed with splendor of buildings and blue ocean "skies"; there are even small girls with pigtails in skirts.\n\nThough voice acting is competent enough for an indie game, again it's nothing special and there are HOG games with better ones (though at least here we are spared cheesy live action acting of such games as Mystery Case Files franchise).\n\nThe game makes it's worst crimes with the inconsequential puzzles. E.g. you have a sturdy stick, rope and thread and needle in inventory and you need to get something out of a grate. There are several possible logical ways of going around doing it, but the game doesn't acknowledge any of them except the default one (say in my non spoilery example - bend needle on some pipe, combine with thread, but not rope, and fish the thing out of grate. Stick could have been used as a lever, or rope could have been tied to grate, but this gets ignored). Other thing - badly implemented HOG scenes. In one location you need something to cut the rope, and in the HOG scene you find two knives and one hack saw. But in the end you get from it something completely unrelated, some specific key, and you have to go and search for default knife in some other location. Objects in HOG scenes get ignored.\n\nMaybe few (well... more than 5, I'm old) years ago this kind of sloppy design would be awesome, or tolerated, but I think the genre has gone a ways and there are already many better games. Drawn series as well as various bigfishgames or ERS games have done it far more coherent. So no. I'd recommend to wait for them on Steam, not to get bad-ish first impressions of perfectly viable genre of games.\n\nAs for the good things - scenes are painted nicely and even if heavily "borrowed", the atmosphere is very nice and can be properly chilly. Though constant jump scares quickly wear thin. This is no Amnesia - the jump scares come by the book and on the clock without much inspiration. Some mini games are fun and interesting and interaction in HOG scenes can be varied and satisfying. There are 3 levels of difficulty, though for me, playing it on normal, the game was much too easy.\n\nSo there. I can't end this review without repeating myself over and over again. Not all components are bad, but there are many bland ones which make the Abyss not seasoned enough. If you want to try HOG games, you could, and you could be perfectly satisfied if you don't expect the next Monkey island, but bare in mind there are even better entries in the genre.","August 24, 2014","false","10.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I love that Artifex Mundi games have this deep twist of mystery in their games with some suprises as well as having music and story that draws you into the game. I would have to say, of their games I've played, this one might be one of the harder ones simply because things tend to blend in more with the background. I can see why that they have you "walk" between each room instead of skipping to the next area where you can perform an action (e.i. like in 9 Clues) but it gets a little annoying after a while. I'm also not a huge fan of the way the elevator works. Still, great game and I enjoyed.\n\nPros:\n-In deepth story and music\n-Fairly good graphics (though its hidden object so i think graphics aren't such a big tado)\n-Easy achievements\n-Sequel potential\n\nCons:\n-Movement between areas (it feels like you do way to much back tracking)\n-The ending (no bueno, if it wasn't for the rat, i would have been very very very disappointed)\n\nToss Up:\n-The blending of objects together (can be a little difficult)\n-Knowledge required to complete game (you have to know some stuff about sea life otherwise the hidden object puzzles will confuse the crap out of you)\n\nMy recommendation 9.99/10\n","April 2, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is refreshing to see a female protagonist save her male counterpart and everyone else.\nIn a perfect balance between all the things that make HO games fun and what makes the utterly horrible games, this one has a good enough story, a good enough scenario, and lacks all the things that make the other games so terribly annoying, like horrible voice acting, a stupid character or the solution to the puzzles too obvious.\n\nNot extremely long, but I got a nice kick out of this one, and a somewhat satisfactory sensation when it was over.

Like most of their games, there's decent variety in the scenes and puzzles combined with just enough running around, item combo, and actual story line to keep you interested throughout the game.  You do locate a map in this game, which becomes helpful in the later part of the story when you are running around more.\n\nThe ending was done well and leaves itself open for a sequel.  If there is a sequel, I will definitely play it.  Side note - I also enjoyed the bonus chapter, which is a prequel for two of the characters in the main storyline.","July 20, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donequis/recommended/284710/","donequis","donequis 🎮","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donequis/","403 products in account","Ah well, this is a tough decision. I was baited by the good reviews and the nice looking previews, and as this game was in a bundle, I picked it up for the backlog. Time went by and I got to play it today - and I have to say, it would have definitely not been worth the full price of 8€.\n\nBut let's go deeper into it. The game is set in an interesting, haunted, underwater city. You play a woman that tries to find her lost husband, which - if you will - was an underwater-extreme-sport-archeologist-whatever-dude. And that's basically everything for pre-story. The game then throws you with a neat handdrawn cutscene right into it.\nIt then asks you whether you want to play a short tutorial, which is useless, and then you're on your own - depending on the difficulty you have chosen.\nYou'll have to do some "Where's Waldo"-style minigames or can alternatively do some kind of mahjongg-clone, then find some items around the scenes, and do a puzzle here and there. And here and there you'll find another little cutscene.\nStorywise the game takes some time to build up and then develops a rather interesting story (which by the way could make for a great FPS à la Bioshock), which unfortunately then cuts off completly at about 95% and abruptly ends the game with a rather boring conclusion and a stupid teaser.\n\nSo now that we know about gameplay and story, what about graphics? While you can't expect much from a simple adventure game like this, it's actually drawn very nicely and has some decent detail to it. It is playable on 4:3 and 16:9, but will unfortunately stretch on 21:9. Also, if you have a 4k or QHD-display, you will notice that the game was created for much lower resolutions. But it's not that bad actually and should definitely not be a reason for not buying this.\n\nOn for the sound - it's good for the most part, environment sounds are nice, the soundtrack is decent but repeats somewhat to often, and then there's the synchronisation - while the synchro for other characters is ok, that for the player is actually really bad. It sounds like the voice artist went through an emotional drama whether or not she should actually continue voicing the game for the given paycheck. But hey, at least she doesn't talk that often, so that's nice*.\n\n\nNow the last point - and this is the one why I would not recommend this game for 8€: It's just way to short. You can easily finish this in 3 hours and will probably squeeze no more than 4 hours out of it. Replay value is just not there since the story is completly linear and there's basically nothing you might miss while playing it.\nBut if this game is on a sale, you should absolutely grab it, if you're fine with casually playing a point and click adventure. If you're more into FPS like CoD, well, I don't even know why you have read this far.\n\n\n* Note for feminists and/or anyone else who might feel insulted: This is not meant to be misogynistic but rather as a diss for the actually bad voicing itself. The statement would be the same if it was voiced by a male. Do with this as you will.","July 20, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
