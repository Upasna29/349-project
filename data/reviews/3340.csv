The premise is simple enough, and gameplay is just as simple.  Where it really gets tricky is when you have diferent types of colorless blocks that can't be removed the way all of the other blocks are removed from play.  This requires you to work around them, use special power blocks, and a special ability that allows you to blast blocks.  The over all puzzle aspect of the game is simple, but the speed of the game is what really makes it tricky.\n\nIf you are more interested in speed puzzles, rather than elaborate and exotic ideas, this is definitely a game to play in small doses.  A great, simple puzzle game for all ages.  Don't forget to try the demo!","November 19, 2014","true","0.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

When I saw the first screenshots, I thought that it would be deflecting a ball or sphere towards the gems to make them disappear. Instead, however, you'll have to sort the gems to make them disappear. Groups of four or more can vanish. And it will just grow more complicated from there.\n\nAll in all a game I definitely will come back to.","March 7, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its a simple game were you match colors and when you match the colors then it removes a layer of block. There is a small story in the game were you have to save your friend but it  doesn't go into depth why. The music is techno and intense. It can get challenging the further you go in the game. Its a thinking game and you have to think fast to complete some of the levels. Its a good game and If you get this by itself or in a pack then you wont be disappointed when playing it.","March 26, 2011","true","2.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.","September 14, 2012","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If someone were to re-make this game with nice interface/graphics, this game would become completely redundant.\n\nOther:\n- Dated","October 15, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
