It doesn't even deserve to be a flash game, let alone be a game on steam. Menus are garbage. Mechanics are garbage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006904748/recommended/399270/","76561198006904748","TimpZ","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006904748/","13 products in account","My first complaint with the game is the developer logo. It's completely illegible!\n\nSecondly, the frame rate of this game is completely bonkers. I actually couldn't find a way to find out the true FPS of the game since neither the Steam overlay or Fraps would work with it but based on my own experience it hovers around 20 to 30 FPS which is unacceptable for a PC game. Take a look at the credits and you can clearly see the text jumping while scrolling.\n\nMy third complaint is the options menu. There isn't any! I can appreciate the fact that keyboard controls are available and with the right settings they might be somewhat useful but really this game was designed to be used with a mouse and thus the movement speed is more or less a useless option which makes the options menu even more lackluster. The game only supports 1 resolution which is 1280*720 and there isn't any toggle for full screen on the options menu. There is a button command for it which is flashed when you first start the game but it disappears quickly and honestly should be listed in the options since there's tons of room for it.\n\nYou can't rebind any of the controls but mostly they're pretty logical so it's not a big deal. However the game does a pretty bad job at menu navigation. What button you need to press at the end of a level in order to continue? Test every one and you might find it's right click or escape but nowhere in the game does it tell you this.\n\nSpeaking of "bound controls", let's say you want to record some gameplay footage or put on some music while messing around in a level or at the end of it. Well too bad because you can't! The mouse is locked to the center of the screen whilst in these modes so you need to pause or quit to the menu to regain control even if you tab out. To be honest it's not a big deal but it's certainly very confusing and frustrating when it happens to you and you have no clue what the problem is since it happens on seemingly random menu screens. Another thing that happens when you tab out of the game is that the gameplay music (but not menu music) stops looping and the voiced mission briefings gets muted but doesn't stop playing.\n\nNow to my fourth complaint about the game. The mission breifings. First of all they're way too long and convoluted. Many do have some useful info but considering the gameplay the game offers you can't be bothered to read it all most of the time. Secondly the briefing is voiced by a computer-sounding female which actually sounds pretty neat. However the things she says isn't what the text is saying. What she's saying is a condensed version of the highlighted text, but if you try to listen to her and read at the same time it's just confusing. Thirdly, there is a lot of information that would be very useful to have in the instructions of the game but I'll get back to that later.\n\nMoving on, let's take a look at the gameplay for a bit. When you first start the game only the Fighter is available and you need to complete 5 missions before you unlock the Survivor ship. These missions are mostly just tutorial levels that let you get a handle of your ship and the mechanics which is fine. The very first mission just let's you navigate through some obstacles for 20 seconds. However there is no way to go faster, you can't gain any score and the only thing dying or getting hit does is lowering your score which starts at 0 and can't go below it so you can literally do nothing and successfully beat the mission.\n\nThat in and of itself wouldn't be too bad if the only goal was to learn how to handle the craft. However when you unlock the second craft IT'S first mission is exactly the same and as far as I can tell their speed and handling are identical. This means that there is literally zero point in having that first mission again for the second craft.\n\nWhen it comes to actually handling the craft, the mechanics are in my opinion very bad. Like I said before the WASD keys are very hard to use to the point of unusable considering the overall difficulty of the game so really you're going to use the mouse for all the movement. However the ship has a maximum speed limit and if your mouse speed exceeds that, a faint shadow of your ship will indicate where your mouse is and the ship will go toward that point at maximum speed. This gives the game an inherent input lag that only makes navigating hard and unintuitive. Other games that has a similar mechanic usually use mouse acceleration to smooth out the movements to make it more natural whilst also having a slower overall speed.\n\nNow it might not seem all that bad at first glance but consider the situation here: you have 2 enemies shooting straight from the left, another enemy moving fast in a cross pattern with fast shots aimed towards you in addition to a big boulder blocking your path and a small boulder that's almost invisible against the background. There's also a boost ring which is a sort of power up that you'd like to collect.\n\nSo basically you want to look at 5 or 6 different places that aren't your ship and steer with a method of control that basically requires you to look at the faint shadow of your ship in order to move accurately in a game that moves this fast. You feel crippled rather than challenged and whenever you do something right it feels more like luck that you happened to move your mouse to the position you wanted rather than skill.\n\nThe second mission introduces the boost mechanic. Basically you can collect "boost rings" in order to fill your boost gauge and then scroll the game faster to get a better level time. You can also combo them together in order to get more boost per ring. The first ring gives "1" something, the second gives 2, then 3 and so on. Once you reach 10 it starts over at 1 even if the combo didn't end and if it did end you also get 1.\n\nThe fifth mission for the survivor ship requires you to finish the level in "Ghost mode". In order to do that you need to gain boost level 3 and then boost to the finish. So you try it a couple times and can't seem to reach level 3. How do I keep the combo going? How long between rings can I wait? Is there a visual cue I'm missing? Do the numbers represent the combo counter or something else?\n\nSo you go to the in-depth guide PDF linked on the steam page and read about Boost and you learn that each ring gives 2% individually, the 2nd in a combo gives 4%, the next 8%. "After this, every boost ring that is reached within two seconds from the last fills the boost bar by 8%".\n\nSo in total there are 21 rings in the level. With some basic maths we find that the maximum combo we can get is 10 + 10 + 1 which gives\n2*(2+4+8*8)+2= 142%\n\nWait hold on that doesn't look right! How much % is a level anyway? If you ignore the actual numbers and just assume a 21 ring combo you still only get\n2+4+8*19=158%\n\nThat still looks wrong unless a boost level is 50% for some reason. So I don't get this mission because the game numbers your combo from 1 to 10 back to 1 and I have no clue if that resets the combo or not because it would be pretty reasonable to assume that if the number go from 10 to 1 that means the combo was reset, but the "in-depth guide" only mentions it being 2 seconds between picking up a ring as a combo breaker so I have no clue what's going on. Furthermore what is the whole deal with the percentages anyway because the numbers don't add up in any way I can make sense of.\n\nNow you stop giving a crap about making sense of all this and try to just get all the rings in a single combo to beat the stage, which is hard because there is no indicator for when 2 seconds have gone by and you can't look at the timer because the controls are ♥♥♥♥ and getting killed ruins it so after some 20 attempts you finally get level 3 and beat the stage.\n\nOr so you thought but you didn't. What the hell why not? I reached level three so I should be in ghost mode right? Nope, in the mission text you read 30 minutes ago and forgot about it says you're","December 21, 2015","false","3.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","17"

I bought it on ShinyLoot: http://www.shinyloot.com/quick-slick-deadly?ref=99e684a0aef2f81a6dd6a3ca5c125cb2 You can find this exact review of mine there as well, which is from June 16th 2015. Also, as you can see on that page, the game was already released on ShinyLoot in July 2013.\n\n----------\n\nPlease don't let this game slide under your radar, simply because the graphics may not catch your attention! Considering this game has been made by only 2 people whereby 1 of them did most of the graphics and the other 1 did everything else, I've been pretty impressed by it! This game is absolutely not your typical SHMUP! The 3 different classes play WIDELY different and the focus is definitely not entirely on blowing things up. Blowing things up is part of it, but there's a lot more you have to pay attention to to get good at this game.\n\nThere are some interesting environmental hazards that not only add more character to the level design, but at some points, you can actually use them to your advantage to destroy your enemies.\n\nThen there are the boost rings, which fill up your boost meter and enable you to increase the scrolling speed of the camera. I've never seen such a mechanic in another SHMUP before and it adds so much depth! You can either focus entirely on speedrunning, or you could go for a high score. Although your time does influence your score, going just for speed requires a very different approach than going for points. It's very impressive that even though there aren't many levels, the game is highly versatile, because of all the different methods you could play a mission. Additionally, the score system is very deep and some aspects of it differ between the 3 playable classes, which adds even more character to each of them.\n\nThe way QSD handles difficulty is also worth mentioning. Overall, this game is not easy and this may put off some people. However, there are a few things that might help them have a not as much rough time. First of all, there is no lives-system. If you die, you simply return to the game right where you lost and the game continues normally. You do lose score points, which may prevent you from reaching the mission goal, which is always about reaching a specific score (except in the tutorials); but nevertheless, you get to continue until the end of the mission and thus see a bit more of it, instead of getting kicked out of the level every time you die. Second, you can pause and unpause the game by pressing literally ANY key other than the ones already assigned to an action. This makes pausing extremely easy, which can help you to "breathe" whenever you need to. Pressing ESC while the game is paused takes you right back to the mission selection screen, so you can quickly restart a mission if you so desire. Lastly, the score requirements for finishing each mission are high enough to be some challenge, but not punishing by any means. You get ranked for your score and you accomplish a mission by getting at least rank C (except for the final mission where you must get rank B). I've never managed to get rank A, which seems to be extremely difficult, but rank C can easily be received with a little practice and rank B is also achievable.\n\nHaving said all this, I must also give you some warnings. QSD is full of game mechanics and the mechanics are explained via some not too long texts at the beginning of each mission. Reading these texts carefully is absolutely essential! If you don't pay attention to these texts, you won't learn the game and easily get frustrated! It kind of reminds me of learning a board game, but the amount of text you have to read is really not much. But again, it's very, very important! If you have difficulties with a mission, make sure to check out the texts at earlier missions, in case you may have overlooked a key mechanic that can help you progress. An example is that the game clearly states that your time influences your score. A friend of mine once complained about the game being too hard, because reaching rank C would already require almost perfect play. What he was doing wrong was he never used the boosting ability, forgetting that a better completion time would boost his score, so he could allow himself some mistakes on the way. This was already explained via the text of an earlier mission, but he didn't remember.\n\nFinally, you must be aware that the tutorial missions must be completed before you can get to the score-based missions. These tutorial missions each require a different goal to complete and a few of them are a bit tricky. Such a thing may confuse some players and there's no denying this game isn't perfect; but at the end of the day, there's a lot to this game that's not apparent at first glance and it has no doubt left me impressed. QSD is by all means a fun, addicting, and absolutely unique game, if you're willing to pay attention! Oh, and it's really cheap too!\n\nPros: + The three classes are WIDELY different! + Score system and boosting ability add even more versatility! + Replay value is immense! + HIGHLY addicting, once you get the hang of things! + Very cheap!\n\nCons: CAUTION: You MUST pay attention to the texts! - There aren't many levels (but replay value makes up for it). - Tutorial missions are not ideal (but it's worth to press on).","September 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 16 of 69 people (23%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","23","16","69","9","14"
