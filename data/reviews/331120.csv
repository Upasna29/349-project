I'm not sure if there's an end or if you are supposed to be attacked every time, but beyond the jump scare that ends the game and send you to the main menu, there really isn't much to be scared of.\n\nPossible spoilers (If you can call them that): You start walking in a dark forest. Sure, that's creepy. Decent music, but nothing as terrifying as others are saying. Your character insists on shining the flashlight just a bit too far down the screen to be useful, similarly to how you hold it when running in Slender. You come upon a few different random structures, but there isn't much to them. Rustling in the bushes begins to follow you around. Eventually you hear some strange squeaky toy sounds behind you. The occasional growling sound. Unless you are the type of person who found Slender to be the end-all of horror games, there hasn't been much scary up until this point. Now, completely randomly, something jumps on you from behind and covers your eyes with its hands. The end.\n\nReally. that's all. I don't know if this game is supposed to "read your fear" like the full version, but it certainly doesn't seem to do anything along those lines. The game tells you to keep calm or the forest will get you. I honestly couldn't have been calmer. I walked straight, didn't stray or jerk the mouse around at all and I was still attacked around the same point. The reviews saying things like "[The game] scared me very much and left me shaking," are obviously opinions and everyone will feel differently, but I just don't see it being that extreme. I'm a fan of horror so maybe I'm not as easily frightened as others, but I just don't see the huge scare here. Try it if you want, but don't get too hyped from all the ridiculously positive reviews here.\n\nEDIT: People keep telling me I shouldn't complain because this game is free. That's just not the case. This is a "prequel" for 'Pineview Drive', a game which costs $19.99 currently. This "free game" is what people will base their choice on when they look at 'Pineview Drive'. I'm not saying it's a terrible game, but I am trying to give an alternate opinion that is different than all the other extremely positive reviews. Maybe the game is better since I played it, maybe I just missed something the game has to it, but there was nothing in it that seemed to "react to my fear" as advertised. That's all I'm saying. Again, play the game yourself and decide. Along with that, stop telling me to not complain about a free game. A price tag doesn't change the actual quality of a game or my opinion on it.","November 22, 2014","false","0.4"," 207 of 262 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","207","262","9","6"

The main goal is to walk through the woods until you reach the pineview manor, but be careful to not make much noise, cause there is a spirit in the woods and it wants to kill you.\n\nThe games main focus is audio. The audio gives you notes when playing, like when to stop and when to start moving again. The audio design is amazing and definitely the best aspect of the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather tedious to say the least. The entire time I felt frustrated when I got killed when I swear that I didn't make any noise.\n\nBut the game itself is quite nerve racking at moments. Some of the sounds really creep you out and they do wonders when creating atmosphere.\n\nThe graphics are nothing too special, you will want to use as less of your flashlight as possible, so you won't really see the environments.\n\nThe game lasted me 30 minutes and apart from the one playthrough there is no replay value.\n\nOverall Passing Pineview Forest is a really fun horror title, even though it has very tedious gameplay it's still worth to play just to get a good dose of horror, not to mention it's free.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Alright\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n\n","March 8","true","0.6"," 75 of 81 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","75","81","4","0"

All you have to listen for are the "extra" foot steps.  Make sure you stop moving completely when you first notice them.  Wait for the foot steps to pass and you will be fine.\n\nIt took me one try to pass this game but spent just over an hour to do it.  Here are the mistakes I made:\n1. walking through the bushes for cover.   This is irrelevant to the game\n2. Stopping for unrealistic background sounds.  Only "extra" foot steps count, stop for these.  Don't stop for any other noise.\n3.  Waiting for at least 10 seconds after the "extra" foot steps pass before moving.  Completely unnecessary.\n4. Walking most of the game.  Pineview forest is like 5 km, so run in the beginning until you find out where you will definitely die, restart the game and then try it again but obviously stop running prior to the point at where you died.\n5. Don't explore the houses. There's nothing in the one I explored which was the first set of houses on the right.  You can't even reach the top floor.\n\nLandmarks:\nA. A set of two houses, one on each side, the one on the right has an axe infront of it.  You can't pick it up.\nB. Another set of houses\nC. Narrow passageway with stupid laughing noises that make no sense in the game\nD. Crossing the river, I don't know if you can die by falling off, I didn't try.\nE.

So, as has been mentioned before, this is less of a game and more of a proof of concept. It's cool that the developers put it out there for everrybody to try out for free. I think it took me something like 10 minutes to run through (literally, lol). It has the appearance of a game using the Unity engine as so many other games.\n\nThe actual controls are simply walk and run.\n\nYou basically start out in a dark forest, follow a path that leads you to a pair of seemingly abandoned homes that you can look around. The path then leads you to a church that you cant enter, past a cool looking statue and a creepy scarecrow, and finally to your doom courtesy of a pair of spectral hands (presented as a jump scare). Normally I would tag this with spoilers, but really, there isnt enough gameplay to warrant it.\n\nThe sound for the game is marginally ominous, and some of the ambient sounds are kind of cool. You can tell when you are close to death as the sounds shift a bit and you can hear something rustling in the forest around you.\n\nThat's pretty much all there was to this. I didnt experience the lagginess mentioned in other reviews and I also played it with maxed out settings (such as they are).\n\nI dont know that this will really do anything to whet your appetite for the full game that is currently available on Steam, but it was interesting enough for what it was. One cause for concern however was the 2+ gig file size. I'm not sure why this wasnt compressed or what have you. Seems like it should have been more like 100mb based on the content....maybe a little more if you factor in the sounds, but defintely wasnt 2 gigs worth of content.\n\nI'm not going to rate this as it really isnt a game as much as a proof of concept, but I'd recommend checking it out. Isnt much of a time investment and it is also free.","February 25, 2015","true","0.2"," 98 of 116 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","98","116","9","1"

The visuals and ambient sounds are very well done and create an environment that goes from relatively peaceful, to hostile very fast.

Well, good user rating so I tried it.\n\n\nPositive points\nAtmosphere\n- Quite scary. You are in a dark forest, at night, alone and you can hear strange sounds around you. Ye there are games which are more scary than this but Pineview Forest is doing its job.\n\nSound effects\n- Good and scary.\n\nOculus Rift support\n- We need more games which support VR technology!\n\n\n\nNeutral points\nMotivation\n- After about 30 minutes / one walkthrough you dont have a real reason to play the game again.\n\nGraphics\n- Average. Well you wouldnt see it anyway in the dark if the game would have better graphics..\n\n\n\nNegative points\nNo instructions\n- "You are in the wood. Now do something! What to do? Well dunno the only tip you get is to stay quiet". At least they could tell you that you got a flashlight because there is also no menu for keyboard settings.\n\nStory\n- Game has no story. It only tries to scare you with jump scares and the fact that you dont know what is in the dark.\n\n\n\nConclusionThe game feels more like a demo for an upcoming game or a test game for Oculus Rift. You dont get much from the game but it is free and it can entertain you for about 30 minutes so you can give it a try if you like this kind of games.","October 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","47","52","2","0"

I was kind of scared and going in to the two houses was probably the only bit that had me on the edge of my seat and that was within the first three minutes of playing but after that it was nothing more than just going down a dark forest path for 15 minutes and listening out for footsteps. It felt very bland and I just wasn't feeling the whole atmosphere of it. The music however was amazing, that's what made it scarier... if there was no music then I would have thought it was just a Forest walking simulator. I watched videos to see what would happen if you ran and didn't listen out for sounds and saw that a pair of hands appear on your screen. LMFAO. Are you kidding me? A pair of hands? I was expecting scary ghostly figures to appear behind trees or walk out of the dark gloomy mist in front of the player only to disappear within seconds. I was expecting a creepy figure to be in one of the houses or a monster that may have actually came in to the house and required you to hide.\n\nJust a boring sequence\nStart walking, hear footsteps, stop, start walking, hear footsteps, stop... keep repeating.\n\nI appreciate  and prefer horror games that focus more on atmosphere then cheap jump scares, but this didn't make me feel scared at all. Worth a try though...","August 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 145 of 232 people (63%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","63","145","232","14","0"

That said, creative endeavours like this are always appreciated—it reminded me of simple, experiential games like "The Plan" or "The Stanley Parable", both of which I find incredibly charming.\n\nThis game is as deceptively simple as its title suggests. You literally pass through Pineview Forest, for a while, along a delineated path.  Having replayed it a couple of times now, there *is* room for variation—I've yet to work out exactly what kind of choices do what (do I walk? run? ignore sounds, or stop each time? is x or y sound on a timer or is it based on your location or a mix/variant of both? does acknowledging what you hear change anything? etc; each of these concerns seems to have some bearing on the outcome). So there is a suprising amount of depth and variability to such an unassumingly-simple game.\n\nThis game is played with your ears and only barely your hands & eyes. That said, it's telling that this game was designed with Oculus Rift in mind, as that would be a much more intense bodily experience—it's unfortunate that the vast majority of us may never get to experience the game that way, turning 180° in an instant to see who or what is "behind" us. I can only imagine it is doubly stressful and frightening.\n\nThere are some very minor quibbles though, and they are over the "gamiest" of issues—looping sounds, invisibly-obstructed travel zones (hopping over a flight of stairs nearly gave me a heart attack because of the noise that I was afraid I was about to make) and the like. Overall, this is a game that is a part of the vangaurd of the new direction that indie developers are helping to steer us toward, and it's nice to see that they are experimenting and playing with the possibilities of the core mechanics of games whilst doing so in such a ruthlessly simple yet effective manner.","November 21, 2014","true","4.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"

They where very cramped and it does make you feel chlostraphobic even though you are in a game. One over thing that i was slightly disapointed with was when i died it just said game over and then that was it back to the main menu to start again.

Involves walking through a generic forest, which for some reason is perfectly flat, with the knowledge that "something" may be following you, though it appreciates you being quiet and so won't jump out at you as long as you remain calm. Numerous landmarks can be found in the forest, including an odd gnome statue and some abandoned houses. Every single landmark, however, serves no purpose whatsoever. After about 15 minutes of walking and inspecting pointless things, a mediocre jumpscare ended the game. Judging from how I didn't find a single indication as to an objective throughout the experience and the fact that the only purpose of any landmark was decoration, I didn't make any other attempts as I figured I had about seen it all. Judging from other reviews, that indeed appears to be the case. I don't really know who I could possibly recommend this game to...

I left the house and soon came to a church. I couldn't go inside, so I assumed God has abandoned me. I continued down the path until I came to a lone scarecrow. It looked as lively as I felt.

Didn't take very long to beat after I identified my errors on my first loss, maybe 25 minutes total. Not much to do, it's basically a walk through a haunted house, except it's a forest. No interaction, no goal, no backstory. Just you, your flashflight and a forest to get to the end of. The "antagonist" is a bit cheap, so as a gameplay mechanic it doesn't really work that well, it's really easy to avoid the "antagonist" once you know what to do as well, making the replay value pretty much non-existent. The majority of the scares are going to be auditory, the background noise and "music" are very chilling. Other than the failure screen there were very, very few jumpscares, however they are all really well done when present, albeit a bit predictable. One of them was also very subtle and gave more of a chill down my spine rather than a straight up jump, which I appreciated as those types of scares are a rarity in horror games these days. Oh and ♥♥♥♥. THAT. JUMPSCARE. The one right around the 3/4 through point. If you play it you know what I'm talking about. Holy ♥♥♥♥ that nearly gave me heart failure. I was playing with a friend too which should have made the game less scary but we both just about ♥♥♥♥ ourselves right there. The worst part was I was prepared for it, looking in the direction of it and everything. Almost had to buy a new mouse cause I sent it flying off my desk.\n\nOverall though, if you want to play a quick, generic but well done horror game, this isn't a bad choice. I normally prefer slow burning existential horror but this definitely entertained me the entire play session.","April 21, 2015","true","0.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","11","14","5","0"

Something about being alone in a forest at night with only a flashlight... the sounds are really what does it. As I walk or run along the path, there are constant sounds around me, mostly rustling bushes that make me shine the flashlight in that direction and make sure nothing is sneaking up on me! The music is also unnerving, sometimes building up unexpectantly and making me jump. While playing, I find myself in a constant state of fear, walking and running along and constantly shining the flashlight around, afraid of being caught unawares.\n\nWhat don't I like? The movement is incredibly slow. On the one hand, it makes you feel more vulnerable. On the other hand, it takes too long to traverse the environment, and seems like a bit of a cheap way to prolong the experience. Also, the character holds the flashlight at a weird angle. Almost like if you held it loosely in your hand with your arm at your side, so the light points more at the ground than the space in front of you. I'd much prefer a flashlight centered on the screen, it would be way more useful.\n\nIf you like first person atmospheric horror games, definitely give this a go! It's free, after all.","May 15","true","0.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","3"

Watching me. Rustling leaves. The soothing orchestra of windy strings and hooting owls carried me along. Into the darkness. Into the mouth of the forest. A fork in the path and my nerve frantically tried to escape in both directions. A leering sound from the shadows on my right sent me to the left toward an open door. The door wouldn't close behind me so I hid in the corner of pale room silently for two full minutes to listen for the same leering sound. It was nothing. Or it was waiting.\n\nMy neck was on fire and my hands leaden. An owl hooted. It was nothing. I kept moving. When I was upstairs I discovered a flashlight and beamed it through a window out into the night. Had I seen something move over by that large house? No it was just my eyes adjusting to the brilliant light. I didn't realize how dark it actually was outside.\n\nOr how alive.\n\nCategory        Rating (out of 10)                Controls - A little stiff and unexplained.        7                Visuals - Muted but realistic tones. Very dark but appropriately so. Very simple geometry and effects but not distracting from overall experience IMO.        7                Audio - Completely immersing. Score is rich and dynamic, seamless transitions and powerful. Just the right amount of emotional influence. Auxiliary sounds are very directional and unnerving.        10                Atmosphere - I was totally spooked out between the dark shadowy visuals and edgy audio. I often froze in fear like a deer in headlights, stiff and uneasy. Immersion only snagged slightly when I had trouble entering a few doors or climbing stairs because of a clipping problem.         9                Play length - Less than an hour if you take your time. Looks like some people have finished the game in less than five minutes.        6                Overall - The game is free and many players will appreciate the immersion if they set the tone in their environment. (Play at night, with the lights off, with headphones on).        8/10\nNote: I played this game without Oculus Rift and still screamed so loud at one point that my roommate came down the hall with sound cancelling headphones on to make sure I was OK.","November 26, 2014","true","0.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I guess this wasn't a graphics test, but Is this the same engine as used for Rust?

Having just recently bought and played Pineview Drive, and seeing that this is both free and standalone, I can only surmise that this is meant to be a "teaser" of sorts to help sell the main game.  The question, then, is does it do a good job of this?  Again...hmmm.  I had slightly mixed, but mostly rather positive, feelings towards Pineview Drive, and I will say that one thing which both this "demo" and the main game itself have in common is a need for PATIENCE.  Having said that, the patience required by the main game was that of the long distance runner, while this one...is more like a short sprint in which you HAVE TO MOVE REALLY SLOWLY AND STOP FREQUENTLY OR YOU WILL DIE.  That's pretty much what this is, in a nutshell, and in that much it only really represents the gameplay of the final (read: THIRTIETH!) "day"/chapter of Pineview Drive, 'cause prior to that, you're really not in that much danger and would take perhaps HUNDREDS OF HOURS to complete the ♥♥♥♥ing thing if you move as slowly as you're required to here.  So is it an accurate "preview" of what you'll get if you purchase the parent game?  Hmmm...not really.  Apart from possessing a similar atmosphere - something which both "games" positively drip with - we're really only talking a companion piece which, well, hopefully "compliments" the main product, while not really giving a terribly accurate indication of what to expect from it.\n\nBut was this even the intention of the developers in producing this mini-game?  Buggered if I know, considering that it has a very different title, and no link to it on Parkview Drive's store page.  It certainly stands well enough on its own, though it does unfortunately feed one of my pet hates, which is games where you can play for twenty solid minutes, die, then have to start from the beginning again 'cause they're AIN'T NO FRIGGIN' SAVE POINTS.  I know this was intentional on the designers' behalves, but I really do seem to lack the patience and/or stubbornness to endure this kind of treatment from a mere VIDEO GAME.  I mean, come on, these things are supposed to be FUN!  Amnesia: The Dark Descent pulled similar ♥♥♥♥ on me with its "Justine" side-game, and I threw the towel in on THAT one, too.  And since I've already given nearly ten hours of my life to playing Pineview Drive Senior, I'm not sure I feel the need to humour this one any more for now.  Sigh.\n\nBut given that this is FREE, and probably less than thirty minutes long if you get through it the first time, why not give it a go anyway?  It's spooky, atmospheric as hell, and genuinely tense (if only because you don't want to have to repeat the first twenty minutes all over again if you die two minutes from the end)...in other words, it's all the things a good horror game probably "should" be.  In theory, anyway.  I seriously look forward to what these devs can achieve in the future, once they're done with dangling all those yummy carrots in our faces for minutes on end before actually giving us a taste.\n\nVerdict: 7/10 (especially since it's FREE)!\n\n(PS Nice little steal from - sorry, "homage to" - Among The Sleep, when your character dies.  Cheeky ♥♥♥♥ers.)","November 22, 2014","true","0.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I highly do not reccomend this game if you live alone, or have issues being alone in the dark out of fear.  This game may ruin your night (or day) due to the psychological horror aspect it has, it is that terrifying in my opinion.  The controls are pretty basic and the game is short since its just a short demo version of the full retail game but don't pass it off for anything less than the psychological horror/suspense game that it really is.\n\nPros:\n\n-Absolutely terrifying atmosphere that really plays on the fear of sounds and how it is being alone in the woods somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere forests/woods.\n\nCons:\n\n-May traumatize some people due to its intense suspense and jump scares (no exaggeration on this)\n\n10/10 (I do not recommend this game if you are faint of heart in both senses of the definition)","August 16, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The jump scare failure state was... serviceable, but I didn't jump out of my seat or anything. Mind you, most horror games don't affect me much, so it could potentially be a lot scarier to most of you, especially for those using the Oculus Rift.\n\nThe game seems somewhat arbitrary, however. What does and doesn't cause a failure state isn't made clear. It says to be quiet. So I was. I walked slowly, stopped frequently. Eventually, though, I died. I tried again, sprinting the entire time. I died about a minute or so sooner.  I have no interest in going through it a third time, so figuring it out is something others can do.\n\nRegardless, it's free, and it's good for the walking simulator that it's proud to be for as short a time as it lasts. Recommended for a time or two.","November 23, 2014","true","0.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I didn't even jump it was more of a "....oh I died...." I suppose I was just expecting something a little more espcially after the first game Pineview Drive.

The first things that caught my attention were the environment and ambience of the forest.  The thought alone of walking through an unfamiliar forest at night gives me a very uneasy feeling.  My favorite thing about the game would have to be the music and environmental audio.  It really added to the entire experience and made me feel as though I were in the forest.  At a certain point, I actually felt my body getting goosebumps.\n\nI did notice something that bothered me, but being mini-prequel game I don't much care at this point.

I decided to give it a try when I noticed that it had overwhelmingly positive reviews while the game it was trying to sell had mixed reviews. This one is good, but I had some issues...\n\nAn issue I have with this game is that I'm not quite sure why I died in it and I think it'd be nice to know or have some sort of sign explaining "this is why you were just killed and this is why it was your fault". The only reason I know that I didn't finish in my short playthrough is because I found scenery on the internet that I didn't recognize.\n\nAnother issue I had is that the settings are poorly designed. I tried getting the game to play in 1280x720 on my 1280x1024 native monitor (yes it's a little old) but even though the settings kept telling me the game was in 720p it was clearly a square window.\n\nIf you want to see my short oneshot of the game, check the video below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr4ENWg0wYU","August 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why does this even exist?\n\nJust a little note: I haven't played Pineview Drive yet. Since this is the prequel, I figured I'd start with it.\n\nOkay, let's get the good out of the way - the audio and music is pretty damn good. The rustling of leaves, the owl's hooting, it's all great. The music, even though it's commonly used as a form of jump scare, is quite foreboding and was probably the biggest cause of chills in the game.\nVisually? As far as I could tell, it looked fine. PPF is an incredibly dark game, so seeing the little details is really a challenge.\n\nSo I've talked about all the good things in PPF, so what about the bad? The gameplay consists of the player walking down a linear path through Pineview Forest, occasionally walking pass statues and houses, some of which are even explorable. The path forks a few times throughout the game, but choosing to go either left or right really doesn't matter, as the two paths always end up meeting further ahead. I feel this prequel would have been vastly better had there been more paths, or if the current path had been anything other than a straight line.\nThe "horror" aspect of the game is really weak. While walking down the previously mentioned path, you'll sometimes hear footsteps or bushes being shaken. This would be 'It' following you; the more the bushes shake the closer it is. To keep 'It' from killing you, restarting your progress, you have to move quietly. This means that running is not a viable option, and neither is using your flashlight. The game forces you to walk the majority of the path. But don't you worry, you'll never actually see 'It', as invisible walls block the player so they can't walk into the woods to look for it.\n\nSo, if you're wondering "Is that all you do? Walk slowly down a path?" then answer would be "Yes". You walk down a dark path for 20 minutes, stopping to explore empty houses and to keep 'It' from finding you. Oh, and you will be encountering jump scares every few minutes. Great.\n\nHopefully Pineview Drive is of a higher quality. I mean, it should be; it costs $19.99 while this is at least free.\n\nSorry if I hurt your wittle feelings, kiddos... But your 'sp00ky meme jump scare' game is garbage.\n\nCurator page:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/","May 7","false","0.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","13"

Only made it to like a chapel thing. Won't play it again.\n\nBut it's pretty atmospheric, and the use of empty space rather than a claustrophobic environment makes anything you came across even more unsettling. It's not run'n'hide, or sneak'n'hide. It's walk in the open and hope that noise was nothing, no protection. You feel no more safe in a cabin you come across than out on the path. You feel no more safe sitting in a corner than running. The game preys on your tension and indecisiveness, creating a mood of urgency with no escape. It plays a bit like Slender but less fun and more scary.\n\nThe idea is barely different enough from other games to offer some freshness. The game is easy to appreciate if you understand how most other horror games work. It's nice, but unrefined.

I mean, it can get stale rather quickly, but after all, it doesn't last more than 30 minutes or so, it's not like you are going to be playing this game for 6 hours or so.\n\nIt can get pretty damn frustrating, if you do not know what to do. Mostly because there are no save points, and if you don't know how to avoid the "thing", well, it's like a gamble.\n\nBasically, you have to go through a long ♥♥♥ forest trail, and something....Is chasing you. I dunno what it is, a monster, a clown, a scarecrow, who knows? Every now and then, you will hear rustling in the bushes, steps behind you, or stuff like that. If you fail to be quiet, something will come and get you.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics are pretty good. The game is rather dark, and let me tell you, that flashlight is pretty much worthless, and it's a dead giveaway, so ♥♥♥♥ that.\n\nThis game builds up atmosphere, via lots of meaningless and meaningFUL sounds, which make you feel rather paranoid.\n\nI find it hilarious how you go through the final door, though.

Also you can't see what the controls are. Graphics is not super but either not bad. Ok, it is free and we should not complain about it for a free game it is good to play once.

So I alt f4\'d, and the game almost locked up my computer to a point where I had to open up task manager to shut it down that didn\'t even work so I waited for about 4 minutes until it decided that it was done doing what ever it was doing, and shut off.

It's....similar....-ish?   So there's only one button that does anything - W. So you can walk.  I was walking through this MEH creepy forest, came upon some buildings, said "that seems like a terrible idea to go inside" so i just kept walking.   Heard weird noises, ominous music, but I just kept walking.  Found out late in the game there's a flashlight button, but you have to look almost straight up to point the flashlight in front of you so NOPE not going to use that.  Came to the end of the forest, BOOM I WIN THE INTERNET!!!   Thought WTF WHAT WAS THE POINT?!?!  So I looked up some YT vids of people playing, they're doing everything the opposite of me (exploring houes, flashlight on the whole time, etc.) and constantly dying.  Not even scary deaths, just basically black screen "game over"  ....\n\nSo, nice try DEVs, but this was a failure.  Took me about 15 minutes of just holding down W to get to the end and win all the internetz.  Would be neat if there was an actual fear of death / failure or whatever.\n\nDO NOT RECOMMEND.","May 21","false","0.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

This game is worthy of me coming out of my shell to boast about it because those who know me, understand that when I say a game is scary, it is absolutely terrifying. Well done to this game, you should play it too and then we can all have a cry about it and be scared of it together. By the way, churches are creepy, heard a door open when I passed by the church, ten seconds later I'm dead.\n\nP.s: I started playing this game at 1:20 in the morning, lights off, scary level to the max, never thought I'd miss the light.\n\n10/10 would poop my pants again\n\nAs For critiquing it:\n\nI do not know much about pineview, however, this game got me curious. It's like most people say, you're out in the woods, and all you have is a flashlight.

You can walk, run, use a flashlight, or jump, and that's it. The atmosphere of this game is what makes it scary, along with the game over jumpscare. The graphics are nice, but not extraordinary. Your only objective is to make it to the end of the forest, which seems simple (and in all actuality it is), but ends up leaving you feeling like you need to curl up in a corner and turn all the lights on in your house. When successfully played, the game is only about 20 minutes long, but it will likely take more than a couple of tries to finish it. Possible spoilers below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis game took me three tries to complete. The first two times, I used a combination of running and walking with my flashlight constantly on and would die right after the statue by the church. The third time, I ran up until the point and walked the rest of the way for the most part, with my flashlight off the entire time. Honestly you need to fail once or twice to get the full experience of this game. Failing gives you a decent jumpscare, which is admittedly pretty poor horror, but it does its job in this title. To be successful, don't use your flashlight, and stop to look around when you hear noises and / or footsteps. You won't see anything, but you also won't get attacked.","January 25, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games should be entertaining as well as utilizing the technology they're built to support, but I was absolutely bored out of my mind. There was no apprehension, tension, or atmosphere, even with the (admittedly lovely) music and dark woods ambiance. Music is best used sparingly, to generate the push and pull of tension and illusion of safety in a horror game, and there was none to be found here.

He's pretty cool.\n\nThe story line (if it can be considered as such) is basically you're in a park for an unmentioned reason and there is something following you.

The graphics are decent for an indie game, but not great. Some objects are shiny which gives them the appearance of being made of plastic. Where the game really falls flat is in it's gameplay. From what I can tell, the basic idea is to just walk, and walk, and walk. Sometimes there will be a weird noise and you will have to run, but this happens only very occasionally. There is also only a very flat road that you can go only straight on, so the first part of the game is very boring. My first time playing, It got so old so fast, I found myself wanting to get killed.

It's rather clever in it's execution, imho. Hear noises? Footsteps coming up behind you? Stop! Whatever you do, don't run...or walk. It's our natural instinct to run from things that scare us. But this evilly challenges that instinct and makes you yield to your fear. Very clever, indeed.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that the music tends to get too loud and you can't hear your surroundings. Let's be honest, if you were actually walking in a forest there wouldn't be any scary music playing in the background. I wish I could at least turn it down or completely off. To me the music really spoils the mood and takes something away from the game. Yes, it's spooky but that's not my problem with it.\n\nAnother problem with the game is that there's no save button or automatic save from your last death. It can get tedious to have to start all over again especially if you don't die by "it". If you die by "it" then I can understand starting again, but the way I kept dying was getting annoying.\n\nMy last concern with this game is that there's no instructions about what keys to use. Even clicked on the info button on the first screen and all it brought up was a bunch of specs. Nothing about how to turn a flashlight on or how to run. Both of which I only found out that existed because I visited the forum. You're not suppose to use those things, of course, but then again shouldn't the developers tell you so they can trick you into using them? That would seem like dirty pool and I'm surprised they didn't. (By the way, F for flashlight and shift for run. Use at your own risk.)\n\nAll in all, I'm really liking this game and I'm determined to make it to the end. My main cause of death most of the time is falling off the beam whilst trying to make it to the other side of the cliff. Is "it" pushing me off of it or am I really that bad at crossing it? Most likely it's the latter.","August 5, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does have that feeling if you allow immersion, but it only last for about 25% of the game, then it becomes just simple mechanics. So it is good if you want a little fun out of a free horror game. The downside is that the came itself only holds its horror for a short time and then becomes a simple "move when there is no sound, stand still if there is". There needs to be mechanics and arbitrary encounters added. I would also suggest not having footsteps unless there is a physical body following behind. If there was, it would be 100% more horrific (scary) as you have something to avoid. There is no physical body and turning around in the direction of the sound that appears to be in your face only to be nothing really kills the mood. The hype was real, but the immersion, the game feel to the horror genre is only scratching the surface.\n\nThe scary immersion is lost once you understand the mechanics. And I hardly play horrors (because I'm a scardy cat), yet blew through this because the mechanics were clear. First round. I would suggest even watching Markipliers video on it and hear his take.\n\nLet's be blunt. If you are looking for a good horror game, this isn't it. I can only suggest the makers to look at the downvotes and see what they are saing. It was fun, but not very scary. And I'm one who needs Markiplier to get through Phobia and Amnesia: TDD. That alone tells you how weak I am. Take it from the big dogs and take what they have and be creative. Good start.","August 13, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hence forth take a gander of my play through\n\nStarted game\nwalked until I hit a dead end.. turned around\nwalked the other way... nay.. ran the other way\nturned my flashlight on and kept running\ncame across two houses\nentered house when forth came a sound that p****d my computer speakers off it was so abnoxious\nturned volume down\nentered second house where my speakers got so mad at the obnixious noise they kicked me in my balls.. .literally\ntried to rub the ache from my testicles\nkept running with flashlight on.. nay.. hobbling because of foresaid mentioned ball issue\ncame across a church I could not enter\nhobbbled down path further\ntwo hands came at me out of nowhere.. with no warning sign at all\nDied\nMy computers hard drive then kicked me in the balls becasue it was furious that I wasted precious space on this piece of crap game.\nuninstalled","October 1, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An owl hoots, nothing that bad.\nThen you hear movement in the bushes. You stop and turn but nothings there. You keep moving, resisting the urge to run as the rustling bushes become your unwanted companion.\n\nThen you hear footsteps.\n\nOnce again you stop but see nothing. After calming down a bit you continue onward, the rustling occasionally being replaced with the footsteps of, whatever it is thats in the forest with you.\n\nI'm not even sure i finished the demo, don't want to spoil anything but I got a game over that caused me to NOPE the ♥♥♥♥ out.\nAs a fan of horror, I would definitely recommend this and the game it ties to. This is horror done right for once, I saw one jump scare and that was the game over\n\nThe one thing it does that most horror doesn't do nowadays is build atmosphere and its nearly on par with older silent hill games. it uses sound and music to unnerve you and get you feeling anxious about what might be in the forest, but you never see it, leading you to imagine what it is. This is how you do horror since the imagination can conjure up creatures and monsters that the devs could never think up, adding to the atmoshpere as your imagination takes over and puts the image of the worst monster you can think of in your mind.","November 16, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's rather clever in it's execution, imho. Hear noises? Footsteps coming up behind you? Stop! Whatever you do, don't run...or walk. It's our natural instinct to run from things that scare us. But this evilly challenges that instinct and makes you yield to your fear. Very clever, indeed.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that the music tends to get too loud and you can't hear your surroundings. Let's be honest, if you were actually walking in a forest there wouldn't be any scary music playing in the background. I wish I could at least turn it down or completely off. To me the music really spoils the mood and takes something away from the game. Yes, it's spooky but that's not my problem with it.\n\nAnother problem with the game is that there's no save button or automatic save from your last death. It can get tedious to have to start all over again especially if you don't die by "it". If you die by "it" then I can understand starting again, but the way I kept dying was getting annoying.\n\nMy last concern with this game is that there's no instructions about what keys to use. Even clicked on the info button on the first screen and all it brought up was a bunch of specs. Nothing about how to turn a flashlight on or how to run. Both of which I only found out that existed because I visited the forum. You're not suppose to use those things, of course, but then again shouldn't the developers tell you so they can trick you into using them? That would seem like dirty pool and I'm surprised they didn't. (By the way, F for flashlight and shift for run. Use at your own risk.)\n\nAll in all, I'm really liking this game and I'm determined to make it to the end. My main cause of death most of the time is falling off the beam whilst trying to make it to the other side of the cliff. Is "it" pushing me off of it or am I really that bad at crossing it? Most likely it's the latter.","August 5, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does have that feeling if you allow immersion, but it only last for about 25% of the game, then it becomes just simple mechanics. So it is good if you want a little fun out of a free horror game. The downside is that the came itself only holds its horror for a short time and then becomes a simple "move when there is no sound, stand still if there is". There needs to be mechanics and arbitrary encounters added. I would also suggest not having footsteps unless there is a physical body following behind. If there was, it would be 100% more horrific (scary) as you have something to avoid. There is no physical body and turning around in the direction of the sound that appears to be in your face only to be nothing really kills the mood. The hype was real, but the immersion, the game feel to the horror genre is only scratching the surface.\n\nThe scary immersion is lost once you understand the mechanics. And I hardly play horrors (because I'm a scardy cat), yet blew through this because the mechanics were clear. First round. I would suggest even watching Markipliers video on it and hear his take.\n\nLet's be blunt. If you are looking for a good horror game, this isn't it. I can only suggest the makers to look at the downvotes and see what they are saing. It was fun, but not very scary. And I'm one who needs Markiplier to get through Phobia and Amnesia: TDD. That alone tells you how weak I am. Take it from the big dogs and take what they have and be creative. Good start.","August 13, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are decent for an indie game, but not great. Some objects are shiny which gives them the appearance of being made of plastic. Where the game really falls flat is in it's gameplay. From what I can tell, the basic idea is to just walk, and walk, and walk. Sometimes there will be a weird noise and you will have to run, but this happens only very occasionally. There is also only a very flat road that you can go only straight on, so the first part of the game is very boring. My first time playing, It got so old so fast, I found myself wanting to get killed.

It does have that feeling if you allow immersion, but it only last for about 25% of the game, then it becomes just simple mechanics. So it is good if you want a little fun out of a free horror game. The downside is that the came itself only holds its horror for a short time and then becomes a simple "move when there is no sound, stand still if there is". There needs to be mechanics and arbitrary encounters added. I would also suggest not having footsteps unless there is a physical body following behind. If there was, it would be 100% more horrific (scary) as you have something to avoid. There is no physical body and turning around in the direction of the sound that appears to be in your face only to be nothing really kills the mood. The hype was real, but the immersion, the game feel to the horror genre is only scratching the surface.\n\nThe scary immersion is lost once you understand the mechanics. And I hardly play horrors (because I'm a scardy cat), yet blew through this because the mechanics were clear. First round. I would suggest even watching Markipliers video on it and hear his take.\n\nLet's be blunt. If you are looking for a good horror game, this isn't it. I can only suggest the makers to look at the downvotes and see what they are saing. It was fun, but not very scary. And I'm one who needs Markiplier to get through Phobia and Amnesia: TDD. That alone tells you how weak I am. Take it from the big dogs and take what they have and be creative. Good start.","August 13, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games should be entertaining as well as utilizing the technology they're built to support, but I was absolutely bored out of my mind. There was no apprehension, tension, or atmosphere, even with the (admittedly lovely) music and dark woods ambiance. Music is best used sparingly, to generate the push and pull of tension and illusion of safety in a horror game, and there was none to be found here. As an experimental demo I'm sure that it did the job, but as a game (even a mini indie) it failed miserably.\n\nI'm just happy that it was free.","July 10, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/griseous/recommended/331120/","griseous","MonkeyFinger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/griseous/","141 products in account","Okay, so I sat down with my bottle of Suga oranic juice. I turned to sound way up, if your going to play do it right. I was minding my own business when I came up a house. As I started to walk in, I quickly looked over my shoulder behind me. It was I clear, so I slowly made my way inside. A strange sound pierced the air, I froze. I could not tell where it had come from.  Up ahead I saw some stairs. Could I safely make a run for it, or would it follow me up the stairs. I bolted toward the ascending steps, the hair curled on the back of my neck. I saw it had a bathroom. Funny it looked exactly like the one I grew up in! What the heck is this game? It seems to know me. How did it know we had a white bathtub, sink and toliet?\nThis game is going to be crazy scary! I made my way down the stairs, I knew I was leaving my safe zone for more of the unknown. I was determined to win this game, even if I would not be able to sleep the next few nights, unless I drank some Benedryl.\n\nWhen I came out of the house, there seemed to be heavy breathing surrounding me, it seemed to be suffocating me. I asked my wife to quit jogging in place and leave the room, so of course it stopped.\nI came up a well out side a house...dare I look in even? Maybe something will jump on my head, then again maybe I will find something needed for this game. I felt like i was looking down the barrel of a gun, just to see if was loaded. I turned the sound up even more, I was ready to get scared out of my PJ's. I slowly started to lean over to look down the well...then it happened. Nothing, I wasn't able to look down the well. So anyway I started skipping down the path again..there off the right, I saw...a face. It was not of this world!! Well maybe it was, but was kind of out of proportion, you know big head, little feet, etc,  As I approached the head, a course hight pitch scream was heard in the distance. Not a far distance,...well maybe a short distance. The face was a stone face. It did not look kind. I walked as slow as I could towards that glaring, evil, smile. If you could call it a smile, maybe more of a grimace....Yikes...did those eyes just move? another scream behind me...Ahhh I am a dead man, I just know it. I threw a large, pink, Altoids in the mouth...um..yeah cinnamon. If you them, they burn your mouth..bite two at once...hot but good. Anyway nothing happened at the stone face, so went on, other buildings, found a roach clip behind on of the houses, maybe good luck charm?\nSo blah blah, I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants, so that took time, but still remained alive...then all scary things must come to an end, there is the gate!! Home safe and sound. Game over! Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat???? Do NOT play this game if you are pregnant, thinking being pregnant, know someone the is pregnant or if your mother was ever pregnant!! Just saying. Ah! thought I was going to say if your Dad was every pregnant...I might be dumb, but I am not stupid...uhhh I meant I might be stupid butt knot dumm!!\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 7","true","3.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
