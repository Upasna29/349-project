A couple of the actors from the first film returned for the game, and did a good job.\n\nCons:\nThe game is £7, but it only lasts about an hour, which really isn't worth it.\nThe lip-syncing and mouth animations are very choppy.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are looking for a game to entertain you for a little while, this is a good game. It is a little expensive for a hour-long game, but overall, it is a charming game.","October 28, 2015","true","3.3"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","63","69","10","0"

I got a time of 52:00 flat. The trick was realizing that the underwater apples and pears were acutally NOT a part of the game but an effect from the LSD mashed potatos I ate for dinner. Never the less, this game is still a mastapiece. EA, Ubisoft, Activision could take a page out of Disney•Pixar's book and creat a work of art like this if they weren't big stupid poo poo heads.  I am the greatest there has ever been in Disney•Pixar's Finding Nemo's speedrunning community. If you wish to get an autograph from me message me and I will give you a copy.

So how does the game hold up compared to the film, well it's great and it comes close to being just as good as the film.\n\nThe Good: nostalgia(if you played it when you were younger),beautiful graphics, fun and easy gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, recreates the scenes from the film in a point and click adventure style game,easy to use interface,uses scenes from the film as cut scenes\n\nThe Bad: incredibly short(you can beat this game on the day you get it),high price for a game that only lasts less than an hour,no settings of any kind,bad facial animations\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nVerdict: One of the best games based off an animated and if you are a fan of Finding Nemo and you never played this your missing out.","October 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","18","29","4","0"

Not worth $0.01 of value.  Dates technology used in the 1990's. Can't change resolution. No controller support. Has many issues working on multiple monitors.
