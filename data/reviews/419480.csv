These fine people care as much for the community as their game.\n\nNow to ther game,\n\n1. It is currently in Early Access Alpha - It has bugs, crashes, and so forth, It's an Alpha, so lets get that one out the way now.\n\n2. On my machine it runs quite smooth indeed. The art wort in game is awesome, ships look great, background scenery is just amazing, Asteroid and debri fields are massive and are quite fun to fly through.\n\n3. Ships - Roughly 40 ingame and looking to have around 90 in total and they all look great.\n\n4. Combat is more fun, I am fighting fleets of ships at times which also seem to call in backup (playing on Extreme).\n\n5. The basics are there, trade, mining, missions, do as you please.\n\n6. Build your own HQ - Oh yeah! my own pirate base...\n\n7. 9 - 10 times larger world than SPG 2 - schweet!!\n\nI will write a real review as I gain many more hours, but if being part of the community helping Warlords design is something you would like to do, Buy it today and join the fun :)","April 14","true","115.3"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","49","57","0","7"

The Starpoint Gemini franchise has been one of my favorite Space Sim games of all time, and Warlords is no exception. Now I know this game just released into Early Access on Steam and there's plenty of bugs and unfinished content, so I am going to talk about what's there.\n\ntl;dr:\nThe game is Early Access and the developers are active and friendly. Only buy if you're willing to support the developers. At this stage in development, the game can be nigh unplayable for some. That being said, I like what they're doing with the game and the direction that they're headed.\n\nFull Review:\nI absolutely loved SPG2, everything about it was great. The developers are extremely active and are helpful on the forums; they are always listening to the ideas of their playerbase. I will admit that the UI in SPG2 was a bit to clunky and in your face sometimes, but it has changed in Warlords to be out of the way. I love the change in UI that Warlords has over SPG2 for mostly this fact.\n\nI'm a big space ship nerd, and space ships need to look breathtaking! This factor was kind of an iffy subject for me in SPG2, the Dreadnoughts/Carriers felt too small and the aesthetics on each were a bit more alien then I would expect from ships made by humans. This is entirely my opinion, but the ships in Warlords are awe inspiring. The first time I saw the Icarus, my jaw dropped. The clean sleek lines of the Concord ships are incredible and absolutely stunning. This doesn't just apply to the Concord mind you, every single ship i've seen or piloted in the game has been visually brilliant. The scale has been upped and Dreadnoughts feel and look like Dreadoughts.\n\nThe one thing about SPG2 that I wanted but didn't have was exactly what Warlords focuses on. Conquering other areas and building an empire is what Warlords is all about, but most of this hasn't been implemented yet. What's there right now is a very satisfying Starbase construction system, and Garrison conquering. When you want to conquer a new zone, you select your fleet and send them to a Garrison. After you arrive at the Garrison, a battle commences in which you have to battle for supremacy and transport troops to the structure to capture it. I imagine that many more features are going to be added which involve territory and zones, but as it stands at the time of reviewing, the only thing capturing zones seems to do is give a credit income.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch on is the sense of scale in Warlords as opposed to SPG2. This is a huge deal for someone like me who loves the feel of space and the time spent crossing it. Warlords doesn't disappoint in this aspect as every object in the game feels right in terms of size. The planets are much bigger and the distance between them is much farther than in SPG2, which makes the journey and exploration feel more rewarding. Exploration is another topic I will lightly touch on before I end this review. The exploration system in Warlords is very time consuming. The area of known space you discover while flying is very small; this forces you to move around a lot to find something that could be hiding in your own zone. I don't really have an opinion about this one way or another, there are Pros and Cons to each games exploration systems and i don't really have a favorite of the two.\n\nI'm incredibly happy with my purchase of SPG:Warlords. Being able to support developers like these while nurturing their new child is a great experience. That being said, the game needs people actively reporting bugs and giving feedback. I'm guilty of not doing this as i'm shy, even on the internet. A post on the community hub this morning prompted me to give my two cents in a review, and I apologize if anyone finds this review to be long winded.","April 16","true","10.0"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","42","46","0","0"

The biggest things that are missing from the game currently are mechanics such as fleet management, ship capturing (to put into your fleet) and retaliation from AI factions.  There is also a lot of polishing that needs to be done.\n\nThat being said, the base game is a lot like Starpoint Gemini 2, so if you want to see how the game plays, watch some gameplay on that game.\n\nAs for frame rate related issues, I've only had instances of frame drop at the start of a fleet battle when attacking another zone.  (This is with a 980 TI and i7 6700k)  I unfortunately cannot report any other issues because my hardware is very high above the recommended requirements.\n\n\nMy verdict:\n\nIf you don't want to support the devs and instead want a fully fleshed out and polished product, do not buy this game.  This is a prime example of an early access title that will be great eventually, but needs time to develop.\n\nFully knowing this I purchased the game wanting to support the devs, and I am happy to have done so.\n\nLooking forward to the upcoming patches.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nYou can definitely tell it's an early access title.  That being said, what's there so far (mediocre voice acting and funky camera controls aside) is pretty good.\n\nBut as always, I recommend you do research on the title before buying.  I like this game but it doesn't mean you will.\n\nI will fill out this review with more information as I get farther into the game.","April 14","true","10.7"," 53 of 71 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","53","71","0","0"

I played Starpoint Gemini 2 so I might be a bit biased, but that just means that I can vouch for this team. They said they will give us a bigger universe to explore but this is overkill, this map is huge! They said graohics will be a bit better. A BIT BETTER?! I'm this close to buy 4K monitor and new graphic card for this!!! It looks amazing. Seriously, I understand all the people that think this is AAA title. It's not, as far as I know, but it sure looks like one!\n\nAnd it's Early Access, something many Steam players don't understand.\n\nAs it says on this store page:\n\nIMPORTANT: This game is EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. Please do not PURCHASE it unless you want to actively SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT of the game and are prepared to handle with SERIOUS ISSUES and POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS of gameplay.\n\nThat means giving a negative review based on game performance or bugs only makes you look funny. If you don't like the concept, if you don't think list of features are interesting or cool, ok. But I went through all these reviews and even the negative ones are not negative. The all talk about how good the game looks and how interesting the concept is but they give it thumbs down because of instability. It's Early Access, it's supposed to be unstable. But the opportunity to give ideas and watch the game grow during Early Access is a unique one and I applaud the team for giving us that opportunity cause it's a rarity.\n\nSo if you want a stable game, don't buy it yet. Keep an eye on it, watch it grow and buy it later in Early Access or wait for full release but the price will go up then. If you want to be involved in the process of development and share your ideas but don't mind the bugs or crashes, then I highly recommend it. It's a rare gem nowadays with space games that offer nothing but promises.

Just wanted to say that although I played Starpoint Gemini 2 I really wasn't involved with the community. That being said, I was following the forums when Warlords was launched and I must say I regret not being involved before. The Devs are obviously very passionate about their games and have a great sense of humour. Issues with launching the game at release were resolved within minutes and they haven't stopped helping or taking feedback since then. From what I've played so far Warlords seems very solid for an EA title. Graphics are beautiful and gameplay is spot on for what is there at the moment. Once you complete the tutorial you hop into free-play where you can do what you want. From owning your own Station where you can upgrade it to build your own ships and so much more to exploring the galaxy and doing side missions for now.  I totally recommend you pick this up and support them.\n\nDevs passion       11/10\nEA Launch           10/10\nGameplay            10/10","April 14","true","3.1"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

Someone expressed it well 'Freespace meets Elite meets Orion'.   OK, we can all see aspects of all types of space sim in this but it's really hard to get that formula right...you know the formula that gives you that, turn all the lights off, turn up the sound, get your face up into the screen and climb into that space immersion suit feeling.\nStill loads to put right, lots of stuff is still wonky and the play is limited but by all accounts this studio looks good to stay the course expand the game and even change the recipe along with the help of it's users.\nI still find it so strange that the biggest studios out there just get it so wrong and the smallest bunch of devs can get it so right.

This isn't a bad thing by the way. I loved Starpoint Gemini 2, I just wanted something deeper. Starpoint Gemini Warlords promises to be exactly this, and if the initial EA release is any indication, it's off to a good start.\n\nThe game is pretty bare bones as of 4/16/16, but the base game is almost entirely there. Regular content updates and patches are expected, with more emphasis on testing before distributing an update.

Already, went through early access with them before with SPG2. LGM devs are very active on forums and most of your money will be spent on development instead of on strippers and booze. LGM included a copy of SPG1 with purchase of early access SPG 2 and then ended up transfering it to SPG 2 so it can be played in improved engine and it was released as a free content dlc Origins.\n\nStarpoint Gemini Warlords is the next step for the SPG series. There are some major improvements already but the game has signs of early access as of day 1 review as should be expected. You find some tabs currently disabled and of course no controller support at the moment because of some design changes. SPG2 controller play was well done and LGM releases on consoles after PC version is done so controller support is coming and I would expect soemtime in the first few updates because they know how improtant controllers are. The series is evolving to add more strategy, features and even the ship designs have been improved. The dev team said first update should be in 2 weeks, they already emergency patched a few bugs on first day.

As of writing this, the game has literally been in alpha for 3 days, and it is clearly stated both on the Store Page and forums that it is a work in progress, with a clear roadmap ahead.\n\nDuring EA, the game should be judged by its scope, its planned features, and how the devs are taking it forward to completion, not the fact that all missions are not implemented on day one. You can follow the overall plan and progress here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/419480/discussions/6/\n\nNeedless to say, this is an EA review, and all the planned features of the game are not unlocked yet. I will update it as the game progresses.\n\nThe Startpoint Gemini series puts the player in command of his/her very own capital ship, and lets them explore a vast, open universe full of possibilities. Warlords is the latest release, bringing a ton of new features and layers of complexity to the game. In particular, it introduces territory, ownable stations and planets, fleet management, and more. Here, you command an empire - not simply a ship.\n\nThe game sports marked improvements in graphics. Not only does everything look better due to the updated Whale engine - it also for the first time SCALES perfectly. Remember how in Starpoint Gemini 2 all ships were pretty much the same size? No more of that. Now, a corvette is properly dwarfed by a battleship, as you would expect it to.\n\nThe game also improved over the UI of the previous ones. In particular, combat and tracking is now much more fluent, and will make the game much more welcoming to newcomers.\n\nThen, there is empire management, bringing full 4X features to the SG universe. You can now conquer (and defend) territory, own planets, stations and installations, manage resource collection, fleet construction, research, and much more. All this while still letting you command any ship you want and join the fray. This feature is still heavily under development, and I will evaluate it more as it becomes available.\n\nFinally, one of the greatest strengths of this game is its developers. LGM are simply one of the most community-oriented teams around, and are constantly engaging with members on the forums, listening to feedback, and involving the community in the games development. They are known for taking community feedback seriously and implementing very much of it in their previous games, and this is certainly no exception. Don't expect an absent dev team when you buy this game - they are constantly around.\n\nAll in all, this is not a game you want to miss. However, do not get it in EA just because of that - get it because your feedback actually MATTERS and will help make this the space game you always dreamt about playing.\n\n10/10 would tell my grandkids I had a planet named after me again.","April 14","true","3.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","0"

But you don't have to worry about losing your progress because auto save is doing its job perfectly fine.\n\nIf this is your first time playing starpoint gemini I would strongly recommend to read quick start guide which you can find on game launcher window. In-game tutorials are not finished yet so this guide helped me a lot.\n\nGame content and features in short:\nOnly one scenario is available for now.\n\nOne of four character classes available (Marshal) others will be available in the future. Every class has 4 own skills and every skill has 5 modifiers. Each time you level up you get one skill point to redistribute it how you see fit.\nEvery 5 levels you get one perk point which gives you additional bonuses (not yet implemented).\n\nHuge open world map, random encounters and lot of exploring.\n\nEarn credits by trading, mining, salvaging. Or take a freelance job like salvage, search and destroy, escort, trade, delivery and many more. Amount of credits you will receive depends on a mission difficulty and your successfulness to do it. Check potential reward and distance to see if it is even worth the risk.\n\nThere is around 40 ships available for you to command and a lot more to come. You can buy ships in shipyard but not all ships are available everywhere. For some ships you will need to have specific rank to be able to fly it. In drydock you have options to repair, rearm, mount, buy/sell weapons, enchantments, equipment  and customize your ship.\n\nConstruction panel allows you to build your own headquarters and upgrade it. Every time you upgrade your hub module you will get more turrets, more storage room, options to build hangar module, tactical ops, salvage depot, trade center, production plant and many more.LGM developers are friendly and very active on steam discussions and on their official forum.

So far it looks like a really good concept, and you can tell they have the skill to finish it off, which something most of these "early access" companies lack these days.\nThe vision is solid, and the mechanics are there. Time for features and bugfixes guys. :)\n\nI'm focusing on the bad things, because as a fellow developer, I would rather know the bad than the good. So it can be fixed.\n\nI did encounter a glitch, went to a salvage mission and dropped fps to zero, was jumping camera around every 2 seconds.  Unplayable. But restarted and good to go.\n\nThe combat can be improved. Enemy ships tend to come to a complete halt mid-fight, and only move to maintain shooting range. In addition encountered a glitch where they literally warped 500 [units of measurement] away. I went to full engine to chase them down, value was locked at 500. Could not reach them. So turned on sublight, and was able to reach them, and 3 more units popped in out of nowhere. Clones perhaps? Random unlucky-ness? Not sure\n\nShipyard is underwhelming, but options for the ship are fantastic. I think the dynamics could be expanded, especially for the enhancements. But overall, very satisfying.\n\nI would give this game a 7/10. it needs polishing, but for an early access, was well worth the price tag. Looking forward to it's becoming.

Needs work on some areas, lots of polishing suggested everywhere, and there might be some broken missions.  Warlords is 100% playable and so far I am enjoying it despite some areas still needing improvement.\n\nSince it's clearly still in early access I am rating a yes.  If this was a completed game then I would rate it a no.  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great game, so I'm here for dev support.\n\nUPDATE:\n-The factions section is not available yet.  However friendly and foe ships are easy to detect.\n-Boarding and capturing ships is also not available at this time.  Cannot replenish troopers.\n-Finance section is not yet available.\n-There is no main story arc.  Just freelance missions at this time.\n-UI is not very pretty, very simple.  But it works fine.\n-Have not seen any mercs for hire, yet..\n\n+Most freelance missions and combat works. (Mostly trouble with "deliveries", not sure if it's me)\n+Mining works.  If your into that sort of thing.\n+Buying and trading goods does work.\n+Upgrades, equipment, and buying new ships all function normally.\n+Large ships available.\n+Large galactic map.\n+Missions are now listed and accepted at starbases.  (no details just type of mission and reward value)\n\nMissions appear more interesting.. On one mission I had to perform simple maintenance on an array, only to find an NPC doing my job when I got there.  The mission provided dialogue options from leave, shoot or share...\n\nUPDATE 2:\nThe game has released it's first update and several improvements have been made.  My review is no longer 100% accurate.  Find out more here on the news feeds.  http://steamcommunity.com/games/419480/announcements/detail/860561390145475164\n\n\nThis is playable, and demonstrates many of the core functions from Starpoint Gemini 2 are here, only better.

Just like in SPG2, this is like a soothing balm to my ears.\n+ Improvements over last title. Everything we wanted after SPG2 we got here! HQ, expansion, more ships!\n+ Very playable for an Early Access title. about 30 different ships, many missions, full exploration\n\nCons:\n- Time to wait for finished product.

Some Developers just take their previous game and copy-paste it to a slightly altered version to generate $$$ much like Pokemon or Assassins Creed. Starpoint Geminis developers are not of this sort.\n\nThe game is currently in an unfinished state and will offer much more when it is finished. The developers will make every effort to create the best possible game. This is why they release the game as early as possible to the players. This generates the much needed feedback > please also post on the steam forum your feedback of the gameplay <. In my opinion the developers increased the connection towards the players from Starpoint Gemini 1 to 2 and more so from 2 to Warlords.\n\nStarpoint Gemini Warlords offers (trying to update the list):\n- a female option for the story\n- a simple but meaningful character creation that gives the player different perks based on the background of the character created (perks currently not implemented)\n- 4 different character classes in addition to the character background (currently only one class availiable / Marshal)\n- updated ship graphics, much better than Starpoint Gemini 2 and ships feel much bigger (more detailed)\n> Carrier have ~20 turrets (was ~12 in SG2), Dreadnoughts and Titans have much more; also much more weapons\n- much better combat graphics, combat takes longer and feels more realistic\n- a headquarter station where fleets and operations can be planned (not just military, also mining & salvaging / science)\n> the main feature of Warlords > you are a warlord, you are not just a captain that roams the univers with his lone ship\n- a much bigger universe (that will steadily be filled with content during Steam Early Access)\n- officers hired for your ship (unlike SG2) will gain XP and can potentially be promoted to fleet commanders (currently not implemented)\n\nAlso in my opinion the game will offer as much as a AAA title for half the price. You get a deep RPG, a Space Action game, a Simulation and the Strategy elements that Warlords offers. From the description:\n\nA unique blend of space sim, RPG and 4X games. Conduct research and construction in your own gigantic space station, command your war fleets and heroic companions to invade enemy territory, build up your stronghold, trade, mine, salvage and remind your enemies why they fear you.","April 16","true","11.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

Pretty much as far as controls go it's exaclty like Starpoint Gemini 2, along with many other game mechanics. "So why don't I get Starpoint Gemini 2 in that case? Didn't you put like 200 hours into it?" Yes, but this will be even better because in here you'll be able to own a space station from which you can build fleets and send them out to conquer the GALAXY!!! You can assign officers to lead fleets to victory as well as defend your own space station from your quite rude adversarys. You can research weapons and technology!

What I can say is that the small amount of time I have had with it has been positive and if the earlier titles are anything to go by then Warlords will be a fantastic game.\n\nI also want to say a little about LGM ( the developers ).  Game development is quite often a them and us experience for gamers, with the ones paving the way by buying the games feeling frustrated and ignored by those making the games.  The 'We know best what you want' attitude is often very evident, but not with LGM.  If there were ever a light in the darkness it is these guys.  They interact daily with the community, they listen to ideas and they implement those ideas if they are indeed decent and viable.  Warlords itself only exists because of all the ideas and requests put forward by the Starpoint Gemini 2 community and that speaks volumes.  Just head over to the Warlords or SPG 2 forums and you will find probably the best community around for any video game, and that is down to how the players and the devs interact with each other.  If you are on the fence about this game buy into the franchise if for nothing else but support for LGM, the industry needs more devs like this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/419480/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nFirst of all I must admit, I only played Starpoint Gemini 2 at a friends house quite a while ago for about 30 minutes, and while I’ve never been into space sims, those 30 minutes left me with a desire to play something like that eventually. Fast forward a few months and Starpoint Gemini 2 goes on sale, I was ready to buy it when I noticed that Warlords was coming out. After quickly checking it out I decided to halt my purchase, everything about Warlords seemed better in every single way, and so I waited.\n\nOverview:\nNow I’ve been granted the opportunity to play this, and my initial impressions are quite positive. The only element of the campaign that is available in the early access is the prologue, where you play as the captain of the Sirene and learn the basics of navigation, combat and interaction. After completing it, the game switches to Free roam/Conquest mode. Here you play as a commander of the Solari Concord and you’re granted command of the Concordia space station. In the end of the prologue you pick up the commander (you) on a medical capsule and in order to retrieve your memories the game prompts you to choose your background, by providing faint descriptions of your past.\n\nIf I’m not wrong, in Conquest mode the goal is pretty simple, expand and defend your territory across the Gemini sector. This is where the game gets really interesting, as of right now you can’t control your fleets but that will come at a later time. What you can do however is, upgrade your station to increase productivity, research and defensive capabilities. If you visit certain locations, such as the Concordia, you can do pretty much what you’d expect on any space sim, buy new ships and customize the ones you already have, buy and sell goods, and take on missions on the jobs board as a freelancer. These missions range from salvaging derelict spaceships to providing maintenance duty and from making deliveries to search and destroy missions. There is plenty to choose from here, dependent upon if you’re going for a more merchant/pacifist playthrough or a more combat focused route. You’re also going to level up as you gain experience and with that you’ll gain skill points which you can use to upgrade different classes/perks.\n\nGameplay:\nFirst things first, the game runs great. I’m running an i5 3.2ghz and a 970 and I’m able to keep above 80fps during like 95% of the times, with everything maxed out (including 8x MSAA).\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, as far as I’m aware it is pretty much like the previous game. There are 4 different camera views that you can use, 2 different front views, a third person view that is always looking forward and another third person view that allows you to rotate your camera around (you can also lock your camera to enemies). WASD is used to move your ship up, down, left or right and Q and E are used to tilt your ship. By using the scroll wheel you can adjust your speed and you can also engage your sublight drive to travel even faster (auto-pilot is also possible).\n\nBy pressing the middle mouse button you’ll bring up a menu showing you the different actions you can take such as, scanning a ship, settings your turrets to fire-at-will mode, amongst others. The left mouse button allows you to select a target and the right mouse button fires your light weapons. There are plenty more of hotkeys that you can use but I’d say these are the basic ones.\n\nEven though this is a space sim, I feel like this game doesn’t focus as much on trading and mining as it is much more oriented towards combat. I don’t have anything against that especially when the combat is solid as it is in Warlords and I usually prefer to go guns blazing while doing some other activities on the side.\n\nVisuals & Sound:\nThe game looks great, you can see that some of the textures are not that much detailed if you’re close to them, but these are very rare occasions. The ship design, the various worlds and the “skybox” are truly a wonder to behold and the soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking and gives me quite the goosebumps. The soundtrack is pretty much all over the place, there are some tracks that have this cyberpunk feeling to them (Dark Pulsing), others that are just plainly epic (Epica) and others that at the same time feel very chill and sad.This is one of those soundtracks which I’m definitely going to listen on my own time, when I’m not playing the game (listening to it right now). Even if this type of game doesn’t interest you, I highly suggest you look up these tracks.\n\nThat said I’m not too keen on the voice acting, while some of it feels just all right, I wish other characters were better voice acted. There is this character called Raynor Trace that you encounter right in the first minutes of the game which looks pretty cool (his portrait) but I feel like his voice has nothing to do with him. He is portrayed with some sort of mask, and so I feel like his voice should reflect that, like having some sort of voice changing effect. Just a suggestion.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI’ve enjoyed Starpoint Gemini Warlords more than I was hoping. I tend to stay away from space sims due to their slow pace but this is something I see myself playing when everything is in place. As of right now, there are still some mechanics missing such as the ability to control fleets and the actual campaign. The basics are in place and they work pretty well. The UI and the menu controls could use some work but other than that the game as a whole is pretty solid.\n\nFrom great visuals, mindblowing music and solid space sim mechanics this game has it all. If you’re a fan of the previous games you’ll most likely have a blast with this one. And if you’re into space sims, I recommend you keep an eye out for this one, it’s pretty neat and it has a lot of potential to become even better.\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com","May 9","true","5.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/419480/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLittle Green Men Games and Iceberg Interactive have returned to Steam with a new title in their award winning Starpoint Gemini franchise. It has been a little over a year and a half since Starpoint Gemini 2 was successfully launched onto Steam.\n\nThe game presently only has an early access scenario which is intended to serve as an introduction to Starpoint Gemeni: Warlords. It is essentially the game’s campaign prologue. It’s endeavor is to teach you some of the basics of playing the game before allowing you to continue free roaming throughout the vast Gemini star system. One of the greatest strengths that the game already possesses is an intelligently designed quick start guide that will aide you in your learning of the game’s primary mechanics. Seasoned veterans will breeze through the tutorial and get stuck into the free roam mode but there may be some little niggles for those new to the game. But so far there isn’t any reason why a newbie couldn’t start here rather than going back into the series but personal preference may be to spend a hundred hours enjoying what the franchise has to offer to date.\n\nOnce you complete the prologue mission and you create your player character – which occurs at the culmination of the prologue mission – you then head back to the Concordia. The options here are shipyard, garage (which is grayed out), the drydock, visit the trader, a news board (again grayed out), a jobs board, continue building your headquarters and more. The job board features jobs such as search and destroy, selvage missions, maintenance tasks, convoy raids and trade missions. This is a way for you to gain monetary rewards so that you can progress throughout the game.\n\nThe dev team still need to get their game Steamified with the addition of achievements and trading cards but those tend to be the little things that are added in later updates closer to the retail release. In a way it would be silly to add achievements to the game in its present state as there is too much that could – and likely will – be changed and added to the game between now and the game’s official launch.\n\nFor franchise and genre veterans you may never find a better time to jump into the game. It is currently priced at $24.99 and it will gradually rise throughout the early access period until it reaches a retail release price point. Important to note is that the game is a full ten dollars ($10) lower than what its predecessor is. We already know from previous experience with the franchise that both the developer and the publishers stand by their products as well as anybody in the industry and thus I feel very safe in advising you to make the purchase decision now.\n\nBigger and better appears to be the early theme of Starpoint Gemini: Warlords and despite early access containing a fair amount of content to date I have a sense that the game only barely scratches the surface of what has already been planned for future updates. I’ve already enjoyed my time with the content to date and plan on spending tens and potentially a couple of hundred hours in the game when everything has been developed. It appears set to be one of the best space games of 2016-17.","May 2","true","1.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","3"

The only issue currently that takes my number one spot is the inability to have teleport/warp jump. The map is VERY VERY big, and getting from one side to another can be...quite....long. Enough that i usually watch youtube videos until i get there, and pray to Holy Mary I don't get shot down by an enemy patrol fleet.\n\nHowever, great scenery of the universe. Lots of ships and guns (plus countless more incoming from future updates). Extensive armament and upgrade system. EASY TO LEARN and quickly get into the game (no need for using every damn key on your keyboard). No microtransactions. I f-ing love it. So far 10/10.\n\nEDIT: A quick reminder, just like what the developers said, currently the story arc stops after the tutorial, and leaves off with side quests like salvage missions and assassination contracts (go kill this scumbag). Once the product nears finalization,the story will pick up and be complete.

I understand it is in very early access so the issues I post are only for improvements to the developers.\n\n1. Convoy escort missions are a great way to earn credits, but I have run into issues where one of the convoys are hit and they stop their boosters while the other two continue. I can choose to stay and protect this convoy but if the other two get too far ahead then I lose the mission. Or I can stay with the two in the front and risk losing the 3rd ship.. which would make me lose the mission. It is a catch 22 and it can be difficult to deal with.\n\n2. On Starpoint Gemini 2, You could travel around and gather a few different missions before you returned to a space station. On Starpoint Warlords, you need to return to a space station or planet each time you complete a mission and you can only have 1 mission running - From my experience - This makes missions very, very time consuming. Especially with the massive distance traveled. I spend my time watching Netflix while I travel.\n\n3. Capturing Garrisons has been the most infuriating task I have tried to accomplish. So far I have gotten the Nova Frigate but I cannot take another Garrison. I have read people talk about how they accomplished it with just the Gunship and I have had to return to a previous save 5 times because I kept failing the mission.\n- The ships are very hard to destroy, especially when they have a carrier, and our carrier barely participates in the fight.\n- The enemy ships slowly move away from the Garrison and if you go too far you lose the fight. This is the worst because I cannot even kill them before they escape and I don't even touch the garrison until I try to kill all ships\n\n4. Grappling and boarding ships has been one of the best ways to earn credits from Starpoint Gemini 2. I'm not sure if I just dont know how to board ships yet, or If the process hasn't even been put in place. But I cannot board ships in this one - yet -. I really enjoyed boarding ships and adding them to the garage. And, in future updates I would love to see the addition to the fleet.\n\nThat is all I can come up with now. I really like this game and cannot wait for it to be improved. I love the potential and Im glad to have assisted in the early access. I will post more issues if I find any.\n\nKeep up the good work LGM!","April 29","true","20.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's not a first person flight game, like Star Citizen, Wing Commander, or Elite. It's a more tactical 1st/3rd person combat game.\nIt's a little bit like Privateer feel... and it's got a similar control system to the excellent Rebel Galaxy, but on a full 3d plane instead of just 2d.\n\nIt seems to pick up shortly after 2 left off, but since we only have the barest of introductions to the story, and no campaign yet, it's hard to tell.\nThe voice over work has improved GREATLY over 2, but it's still the weakest part of an otherwise great series.\n\nControls\nThe controls seem largely unchanged from SpG2, which is a good thing.\nIt allows you enough control to do what you want, when you want to, but it's not so complex to require a 75 page manual and a doctoral degree in astrophysics.\n\nHud\nThe Heads Up Display has improved quite a bit, with more information readily available with minimal effort. It's cleaned up and minimalized to a much greater degree than 2 was, and there's no longer a permanent dashboard at the bottom of the screen. A win for aesthetic pleasantness.\nOne gripe about the Targeting Reticle however. It's HUGE, Granted, there's a ton of information on it, but some of that info could be presented in a better way. I don’t need 46 giant green bars to tell me how much health a ship has, just the green arc from the last game was plenty. It's also busy/active. There's a lot of doodads present on the targeting reticle, that while looking like IronMan's in-helmet view, is cool looking... it mostly just distracts from the information presented.\nIf the Reticle is cleaned up a bit, it'd be a huge improvement.\nOne thing I would add, a "view" notification somewhere on the hud, like SpG2, that says if I'm in "normal" view or "turret" view. When using the mouse, you can inadvertently veer off of your destination if you click left while in "normal" view.\n\nGameplay\n\nJust like the last one, the controls are clean, logical, and responsive. The quick menu (middle mouse) has just about everything you'd need to access, and it's fast and convenient.\n\nStory\n\nWhat we've seen so far is interesting, if only a preview.\nA new model battleship, a conspiracy to destroy it, and seemingly, some kind of coverup. I'm anxious to see the rest as the Early Access gets closer to finished.\n\nVisuals\n\nBeautiful. The space textures are vastly improved over the aging SpG2 engine. It's absolutely GORGEOUS to look at. It's not Star Citizen level of detail on the ships or anything, but it still great looking. Screenshots do not do it justice.\n\nSound\n\nSound effects are good. Nothing too annoying, nothing out of place.\nVoice over work has never been a strong point in the series. SpG2 was downright laughable. It was like a B-movie, so terrible it's good again.\nIt has improved (so far) in Warlords, and some of the more germane conversations have skipped the VO work entirely and gone text. A lot of your responses and interrogations are this way. I'm perfectly okay with that.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf the game continues to improve on the trajectory that it's currently on, this will be a SOLID game.\nIt is Early Access though, and that it is not yet feature-complete, might put some people off. LGM (Little Green Men) however has a great rep for continued development and listening to their customers.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game to anyone a fan of the spacetrading/spacecombat genre.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I stream this semi-regularly on twitch\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/longscope_","April 20","true","15.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Being an EA game, not all of the features are implemented yet, but what is there is awesome. The game looks better than it's predecessors, and the new features like conquering territory, and improving your HQ are intriguing. While I don't reccomend early access games unless you seriously want to playtest an unfinished build and participate in community feedback, I will say that this is an alpha build that is more fun and better designed than many of the betas I've played. So if you want to get in on the ground floor and help shape the development of the game (Little Green Men really listens to player feedback) then get it while it's at the EA pricepoint.

But I've gambled on a few and have ended up having a hand in the creation of some pretty great games, albeit a very tiny, diminuitive, one that lacked any kind of actualy power.\n\nSPG Warlords is definitely a game that, when fully finished, will be a great item to add to your library, especially if you enjoy space-sims or RTS or even building games.  While very unfinished (It's EA, not a complaint, just a point) and still lacking balance and polish, it's quite fun even in it's current iteration.\n\nAs things are it's VERY grindy, or at least has been for me, but I could of course be doing this very wrong.  The ships are fun and have good designs.  The weapons, while not terribly varied, offer you  a good amount of choice, both aesthetically and tactically.  The game systems are a little confusing on their own, having to grope around in the dark through trial and error in this game was very difficult, as buying things is expensive, and selling them is quite the opposite (more so than any other game I can recall playing with this kind of system).  So you have to work very VERY hard and very very VERY long for any gains.\n\nThe choice of ships is severely limited, although they have mentioned several times that you're given about 30 ships in EA and there will be 90 on full release.  I also haven't explored more than say 5% of the map (if even that much of it), so I may just not have seen all there is to offer.  But the limited selection of ships are not only gated behind INSANE currency requirements, but also level/rank ones too, which, to be honest, are a bit much.\n\nThe camera is VERY confusing until you find out what all the buttons that affect the camera do, and how to go back to what's more or less the "default".  The options aren't bad, in fact, they allow you to fly and fight in very different ways, which is smart and well done, but without an explanation beyond what the game gives, it took me quite some time to accidentally figure out what the different button presses did and how to undo them.  Luckily, upon loading a game, you're brought back to the default camera mode, so if all else fails, there's that option.\n\nFor an EA, and such an early point in that EA, this game is good.  With some polish, a little more implementation of features, and explanations of game mechanics and systems, this is going to shape up to be a gem.\n\nAlso, and not really very important but still needs noting, this game is GORGEOUS.  Realistically, none of what they've done visually is plausible, but I honestly couldn't care less about the lack of realism, as the pure beauty of ALL the visuals is just so incredibly well done.  If nothing else, this team has some wildly talented artists.","April 22","true","21.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

In this game you press the same button for the same action but the game now pauses and you have to wait for the screen to go black and the options to spin onto screen like a hand on a clock spinning in a circle. Why did you do this? Sending commands such as grapple a target to marking a target for attack should be done on the fly in combat and now it’s a slooow pause button. In Star Point 2 I would hit the middle mouse button and issue commands and never feel like I was out of the action, I was on the edge of my seat! Now I hit the same button and sit back to relax for a minute. It just kills the whole vibe of combat.\nYou may feel that this is really not an issue. But how many fights do you think you will get in in a game about space combat? Now lets say that most fights have 5 targets. Lets further say that you want to micro manage the first 3 targets that are killed or launch fighters or grapple or send a boarding party or any number of things from the command wheel. Let’s say it only takes 10 seconds to open the wheel, choose an option, and close the wheel. That’s about 30 seconds a fight. 30 full seconds when each time I do something I feel I have to do that I get pulled out of the game and shown that it is just a game. I’ve played the game for about 2 hours and, honestly, I don’t know if I will give it more time. If I do I can’t return it.\nThis team makes great games but this pulls me out of the experience and reminds me that I’m playing a game.\n","May 7","false","2.3"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","16","36","4","9"

Simply stuff such as buying a new weapon and mounting it, is just like, what the heck?\n\nSetting the keyboard controls in the previous version was a snap. 5 Minutes and I was up and running. This one took me nearly an hour because of all the conflicting keys, again, I don't know why but it was a pain in neck. My first session was basically trying to setup my keyboard and by the time I was done was exhausted and went to another game for a bit.\n\nIt's been said the map/galaxy is quite a bit bigger. Honestly, I'm not seeing this. The number of planets/locations looks about the same or even smaller, the little things that bugged me in the previous version are still present as well, such as stations suddenly appearing out of nowhere instead of gradually appearing far in the distance, ships that float more than seem to fly in specific directions, etc.\n\nSo I don't know, all in all, coming from the previous version, and yes, realziing this is still in Early Access, I get it that it's not finished, but I'm disappointed that many of the visual flaws from the previous are still present and that now the game's interface, which used to be a piece of cake to figure out, is just so strangely difficult to figure out now.\n\nI'll wait it out till full release, but not holding my breath. No Man's Sky is right around the corner and I don't see this being ready before that.","April 30","false","3.4"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","2"

I am prepared to give a lot of credit based on early access status, but also have to take some away when all the new elements and some which should have carried over don't work.  Many of the problems with some early access games like frequent crashes I am not seeing, but essential gameplay basics aren't working.  This game is about 50/50 to me since I am confident it will be good in time and would suggest getting it eventually, but can't recommend buying it yet since it isn't quite playable yet.\n\nThis is my second review for this product, the first was attacked for being negative, as if you should never criticize a game which has released an early version for feedback.  If this was a final product I would be telling everyone to run away, I am not.  I have seen released games which were worse than this.  On the other hand I see some glowing, professional looking, positive reviews which don't quite seem honest or accurate to what I am seeing in the game.\n\nIf you are willing to spend the money for a game which is not quite ready for play so you can test, provide feedback, bug reports, and support the devs get it now.  If you want an enjoyable game which ins't frustratingly broken within an hour, wait for some updates and maybe enjoy their earlier games.

I've already spent a fair amount of time with this game, and while I do share some of the common complaints about things such as Travel and enemy fleet density, I find that for an Alpha, this is extremely well done.\n\nFirst of all, the environments are outstanding visually. I would however like to see a slightly more dynamic background. A Static flat image the show the greater deep space just kind of kills the illusion of depth and makes it feel like your kind of playing in a box. Meanwhile the debris and asteroids are well placed and kind of offset the distance issue a bit.\n\nCombat feels pretty fluid for the most part, I would however like to see a turret view where you can Aim the turret manually while the ship flies on it's own pattern. Minor detail there. Target cycling feels a little cluncky, but I've been using manutal click targeting for the most part anyway so I can't really say much on that one.\n\nWhat voice acting there is, seems believeable, though I do hope for some variations in the sound design a bit to make them sounds like they are coming from a com system as opposed to a person right inside the ship.\n\nNavigating the menu's is pretty easy, though the one complaint I have there is that when trying to leave say the docking menu, I tend to his esc and hit the main menu instead of being returned to space, so that might be something worth considering for the final version.\n\nIn terms of hard suggestions, I'd probably say to dial back the Docking request distance of planets a bit, as the textures seem to lose all Their effect at that close range, perhaps impliment some kind of gravity well that prevents players from coming in that close to help maintain some degree of illusion that they are near a planet.\n\nThe game seems pretty heavily reliant on the context sensitive menu, so perhaps a quicker transition to the menu would help to maintain immersion in the game. As it stands now it's semi Disruptive to the immersive feel of the game (Deffinatly don't eliminate it though, it's a nice touch)\n\n\nAll in all I like where this is going. I'm eager to see the direction this game goes, and what happens to it's overall development. I'd recommend this game very much because I feel that this will be one massive beast of a space game. From what I see at the Alpha level, I can only imagine what's set to be in the final release.\n\nIf the game ends with the scale and depth that this Alpha alludes to, It'll be a top notch game no matter what kind of player you are.","May 16","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
