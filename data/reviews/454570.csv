I appreciate what you've tried to do here, but you could have at least spelled ♥♥♥♥ing FORUM right. Did you even play through your own game before asking money for this?\n\nTried to keep playing... This is an rpg maker game with no effort put into any of it except some creepy voice over. Gameplay is tedious AF and at most points it's very unclear what the player should even be doing.

I just wanted an answer, I cared little  about whether or not you supported it. I was concerned as to why.\n\nYou also slandered windows 10 by calling it broken and trashy on a thread you since deleted.\nThat is unprofessional, but what more should I expect from a person who acts like you.\n\nThe game -\n\n1 ) Visuals - The visuals are ok, I applaud the fact that you use some of your own assets but the vast majority of the game is stock RPG maker. The parts that you, or your artist did contribute are 'meh' The drawings could be better\nEach character portrait has them facing on a 3/4 angle and the eye closest to the viewer is fudged. It appears to wrap around the face from nose to ear. You dont need a mirror to see thats wrong just feel your face...eyes dont do that.\n\nIt is colorful, but the color choice is rather generic and the lighting is nothing special.\n\n\n2) Gameplay - Its RPG maker and fairly bog standard at that,  *** I will acknowledge that good rpgmaker games exist but that they are also rare*** This simply isnt a diamond in the rough, it's just more 'rough'\n\nThere are some collision issues, there are sections where the sprite's *depth* is incorrect and he will appear ontop of rooves when he shouldnt.\n\nLeaving Rome is also  weird. I can tell that you have 1 specific tile set to trigger the 'leave town' prompt\nDoesnt matter what direction you face, which is something some polish would fix.\n\n\n\nEffort - I think the artist put a fair amount of time into his or her drawings, but the game itself is weak in this department. I think this is the issue a lot of rpg maker devs have.  I am not sure why, seeing as the heavy lifting is done in rpg maker itself...\n\n\nPublic Relations - Lato is banning and deleting forum posts - BIG NONO\nanything remotely critical is removed and labelled as toxic, I am not one to call names, so I wont, but I will call your actions what they are, Uncool and somewhat cowardly.\n\n\nAt this point, I will need to see some substantial upgrades to future games before I vote YES on greenlight again.\n\nand yes I am getting my refund for 1.09\n\n\n","April 2","false","0.5"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","74","83","9","8"

Within it, you'll find horrendous grammar, walls you can walk through, and unbalanced combat. Oh yeah, and there's the completely unbalanced sound design and lack of subtitles for the voice acting. The sound will go from completely blasting out your ears to having to turn up your speakers to even hear anything.\n\nI cannot recommend I Am Caligula at all. There's no direction on "where you should go next", you just have to wander and hope you find the next trigger. There are missing commas everywhere, as well as there being a number of run-on sentences. No, I don't claim myself to be amazing at English, but getting a proof reader (especially if English isn't your main language) can prove vital to helping writing flow.\n\n*Note: I played this before a grammar patch was put out. I did a quick check and a number of the grammar errors I saw were still present.

He got a pretty bad attitude upon his customers, he outright REFUSE to solve the problems several Windows 10 users have with his game, he likes to bash Windows 10 as well, and he BAN me from the Steam Game Forums because I had written I do not wish to support him anymore! I'm always a polite person and this is the first time I'm banned on Steam. The worst part? He removed all of my comments and his bashing at W10 comments, to cover his tracks and to look innocent! This is dishonesty. I refunded my copy of I am Caligula right away and I recommend anyone not to buy from him.\n\nProof image of ban: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=694561570\n\nFortunately for you guys, I got his now deleted post about him bashing at W10 written down :  ''Windows 10 users! Do not buy the game. We all know Windows 10 is s h i t for games. If you read the req specs for the game you would see I did NOT include windows 10!\nIf you own Windows 10 and the game plays fine, great. If you already bought the game and Windows 10 makes it crash then refund the game, that's why the refund system is there.''\n\nThere is also this 'nice' post by the dev about W10: ''When everyone else figures out how to fix their games from Windows 10 I will be able to. I use Windows 7 like everyone else in the world that likes video games.''\n\nAs for the game, since a Steam review should be about THE GAME and not only the dev, it's a pretty generic, 90 min, RPG Maker game, with a boring storyline, few fights, and a disappointing ending.\n\nFRENCH (FRANCAIS):\nJ'avais vraiment aimé ce petit rpg, et je ne comprenais pas pourquoi un groupe haineux pouvait cibler son développeur. Il semblait être un gars bien sympa et honnête. Comme je me trompais.\n\nIl a une attitude malhonnête envers ses clients, il refuse de régler les problèmes ou bouges que des usagers ayant Windows 10 possèdent, il se moque carrément de ceux et celles ayant W10, et il m'a BANNI du forum de la communauté, tout en effaçant tous mes commentaires, parce que j'avais écrit que je n'avais pu envie de l'encourager!!! J'ai toujours été quelqu'un de poli et je n'ai JAMAIS été banni, jusqu'à présent. J'ai aussitôt demandé à être remboursée et j'encourage tout le monde à ne pas acheter de ce type.\n\nPreuve d'avoir été bannie: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=694561570\n\nEt pour le jeu, puis qu'il fait aussi en parler, c'est un RPG Maker de 90 min, avec une histoire ordinaire, peu de combats, et une fin décevante.","March 29","false","1.7"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

There is too much space to explore without direction and fun things to discover alond with unessessarily long, mazelike, and uninteresting old school RPG combat/dungeon elements.

That being said it's only $1 and you can't even buy a cup of coffee for that anymore. This is a typical RPG maker game and it plays as such. It isn't perfect but isn't as bad as some of the other reviews are saying either. It isn't likely for everyone based on the touchy subject but also is somewhat historical. I can see from other reviews that there have been some issues between players and the developer and it is too bad this stuff has happened as I do feel the game is decent and worth a shot for people interested in the topic. I feel like the addition of playing cards and achievements would help a game like this but after having read in the discussion forums, it seems like this isn't going to happen.

Let me say this right now. This game isn't for everyone. I Am Caligula, I played this game back on Itch and i was one of the Beta Testers for it to. I gave Lato Feedback on it and even found a Game Breaking Bug that he didn't know about to before it came to Steam. Back then, the game wasn't as good as it was now. It didn't have many of the Cut Scenes that it does now. Lato really did try his hardest with this game with adding things into it and all.\n\nAs for the story and what people are saying, it does follow Real Life events of Caligula. A lot of people are calling it an Incest Sim, but the truth is if you Google it, Caligula really did have a Relationship with his Sister. That is actual history of the Emperor. Now I'm not going to lie and say that he did add some Fantasy Elements to the Story, but he did it to flesh out the Characters and give them some back story. Read the Wiki page on Caligula and then play this game to see how Accurate it is. You'll find out a lot of the things in the game are accurate. Caligula was one of the most Insane Emperor's ever back in the Roman Empire.\n\nAs for the Graphics and Sprites, a lot of it was hand made and drawn by an Artist. A lot of work did go into that. Some of it was Default things, but not much.\n\nThe Sounds and Music really does go with what is happening during the time. Sometimes it's hard to find the right music for an area of a game, but this one flows well given the length of the game.\n\nAs for Combat, you do have to do a bit of Grinding in it before moving on to the next area. Not much, but a bit. The combat isn't that hard to go through and figure out.\n\nAs for the Navigation in the game, you just have to talk to people like in ever RPG game and Explore. It's not hard to figure out what to do next or where to go.\n\nBottom line is it's not a game for everyone, but i do reccomend it and for people to give it a try before bashing it. I've played my Fair Share of bad RPG Maker games and I will be completly Honest. I've played a lot worse than this. Games where no effort was put into it at all and use nothing but Default Sprites and Assestes. At least Lato did try with this game and that is something. So please, before you give it a Neg Review, at least remember the points I've laid out in this Review and try it out with an open mind.)","April 2","true","2.2"," 9 of 31 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","9","31","0","0"

It can be fun, but it has a bit of a learning curve. It is reminiscent of old KOEI games of past for me. Reminds me a bit of Uncharted Waters and some might consider it similar to some of the original Zelda games. If you like these kind of games, you will probably enjoy this, if not then don't buy it you will likely be unimpressed.\n\nThe game puts you in the shoes of Caligua, 1st century Roman Emperor. If you like historical games, this might be for you too. So far though I've not seen too much in the way historicalness other than the Emperor's name, this isn't to say there isn't more.\n\nThe artwork is nice, especially on the overhead screen. It can sometimes be tempting for developers to cut corners here, in this game this not the case. The game add voice actors which can be nice for those that are kinda lazy, and don't want to read. A few of them are nice, a few others are midly annoying, but no fear you can skip over them if you like. The world is enormous, at least it seems to as I am constantly getting lost in a labrinth like city.\n\nAs of right now I recommend the game. The low price doesn't hurt either, definitely worth 5x or more what I paid for it. I'll continue to play it, and follow up later on with replayability and time to complete. Good enough for not only me, but good enough that I'll be sending a few copies out as gifts.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind. Combat mode you are on the right side of the screen not the left, this can be confusing at first. To get to full screen mode hit F5, hit it again to go back to windowed mode. If you dont do this the small screen will get distracting real fast. Spacebar allows you to talk to people.\n\n=== 2 HRS ===\nOk 2hrs in... I'll try and keep this objective. The game starts off a little wierd and is hard to follow. I spent a good time running around trying to figure out what to do. This is kinda difficult to deal with. Once the story line starts it gets going and I found myself having fun fighting anything and everything in Germania once I got the hang of the strategy involved in combat. I could offer a few tips here but I won't, I don't want to play spoiler.\n\nOnce glaring issue is spelling and grammatical errors (watch I bet I spelled that wrong.) There are a few haters who have left reviews, I recognize one of them from a hate group that was started against the developer before the game even launched.\n\n=== 2+ HRS ===\nThe game started off a bit confusing. As the game picked up I became more engaged. Again mad spelling issues. I do have a few things I'm not particularly fond of. It's hard to understand what to do next, there isn't much guidance. I did however complete the game, only took a little over 2hrs, but I'm confused as to... well... how. The game just kinda abruptly ended. There is a ton of potential here but it's missing some content. I was not a fan of the ending.","March 25","true","2.9"," 34 of 91 people (37%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","37","34","91","4","0"

This story is based on a true story. Yes. The events are historically accurate. Yes. The game has flaws but so does every blockbuster game now a days. Personally, I have never made a game before. I am sure it is a daunting undertaking. To take such an unusually and uncomfortable story and turn it into a game takes a bit of courage.\nDuring the time I spent with I Am Caligula, I found many things to be surprisingly lighthearted. From the smug comments to soldiers or the vendor with 'crazzzzzzy' low prices, I found a bit of humor in this game. Whether that was intentional or I am just weird, I don't know. I also enjoyed the music and the voice acting is well done.\nThe game is obviously an RPGMaker game. The game is limited by that alone. I feel that there needs to be more in this game. More interactions in the streets and side quests would be cool. I am not too far in the game and I may find those things. I had a platforming issue where I was stuck on a narrow path behind a NPC that would not get out of the way. While I found this annoying, I also found my self laughing and wondering if this was a way to simulate the crowed city streets of Rome. I want to feel more of that Roman atmosphere. I don't know how to do that. I am a musician, not a game developer.\nCaligula is a rather taboo creature in history and to make a game about him and his lesser known sister is refreshing. Re-imagining  the familiar JRPGs of yesterday by throwing a ruthlessly insane emperor/dictator in the mix is almost post-modern. I Am Caligula is cheaper than the price of a candy bar.

"I Am Caligula" is not focused on the game-play aspect, as many people seem to think it is. It is a story-based RPG Maker game, with quite an interesting story.\nYou play as a young man, who is heir to rule in Ancient Rome, and do so with your sister, not as your sibling, but as your lover. The art style is quite appealing, and it looks very nice overall, the\nover-world is nicely designed, with many small details, making it more believable of an actual location. There is a variety of sprites you may see in the over-world, all of which have quite fluid animations,\nand are very colorful and well designed. The voice acting within the game is very nice quality, some of the best I've ever heard, to be honest. Though the game-play may be repetitive, the game focuses more\non story, than on game-play. The story is very in-depth, and you can get easily immersed in the story, and the world. There are quite a few areas of the over-world to explore, each being vastly different from  the last, giving the exploration aspect of the game much more depth. There is no censorship in the game, which is always a plus. Though most RPG Maker games aren't that great in my book, this one definitely changed that. If you've ever made an RPG Maker game, you'd know how much effort and time it takes to make just a fraction of a world, and takes forever to script events and write dialogue. So, really, when people are saying that there was no effort put into this game, they look past the time it must have taken to make the game, and then the time it would have taken to draw all the art, and do all the voice acting. And really, at 99 cents, you really  can't complain. Overall, this is quite a good game, and I'd recommend it to people looking for a deep story-line to immerse themselves into. And at 99 cents, you really can't go wrong!\n\n\n( Also, you can take your sisters panties, so there's always that. )","April 2","true","0.7"," 3 of 21 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","3","21","2","0"

The game is simple to learn and play but gives little direction on what you should be doing next. I found the world fun to explore, but was disappoitned when the major events of the story didn't impact the world. The is no real development to the characters at all.\n\nThere are a large number of glitches and errors in dialogue. The sound is overbearing but the soundtrack works for it. I've seen a lot of complaints about the combat system, but I only ever had one character die on me throughout the game, and after hitting level two found very little challenge in the combat.\n\nThis seems like a typical first try at making an RPG Maker game. That said it also feels that this was supposed to be a much larger project that got rushed and truncated.\n\nStill with all the bad I have to recommend this dinky little game as I did enjoy my time playing it and it even made me laugh a few times, making it totally worth the 89 cents I paid for it.","March 28","true","2.6"," 3 of 22 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","3","22","0","1"
