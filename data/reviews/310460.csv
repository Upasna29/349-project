I've changed my first analysis.\n\nGame's atmosphere is nice and, if you are a lover of Corto Maltese comics, it seems appealing enough.\nThe aim of the game is to quest by yourself, outside the game (Internet), to answer the riddles that the game offers to you. This makes this game unique and, enhances the detectivesque feeling, since you are yourself who should investigate outside the game, browsing wikipedia or google maps or whatever other source of info that could help you to get the answer.\n\nThis is one of the hardest click & point adventure games I've ever played (and, played a bunch). Sometimes, the tips or clues aren't that clear and can lead you to absurd paths. The bad thing is that there is NO guide or walkthrough anywhere (there is just a single one covering the very first steps), by today.\nI was really stuck for several days with just one riddle and, I was going to give up the game, until a forum mate was giving me the last piece of the puzzle to get the answer.\n\nAfter suffering lot of frustation, I've finally ended it and now, I feel more satisfied than with other easier point & click adventures.\n\nSo, you've been warned. If you love HARD point & click adventure games, try this one, even if the character of Corto Maltese isn't appealing to you. It worth the effort.","December 16, 2014","true","26.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

(More details below.)\n\nThe Good: Truly exceptional world-building! It's a fun mix of Dan Brown, Assassin's Creed, and Tintin. There's a nice balance of occult history, Venice travelogue, Judeo-Christian mysticism, and political thriller elements. The narrative hits all the right notes for me.\n\nI don't even mind that the present-day sequences don't use the art style from the original comics, because I wasn't very familiar with Corto Maltese before playing this game (other than a few tangential references in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).\n\nMany of the puzzles are genuinely fun, even if they seem a bit ridiculous in the context of the story. In fact, I wish I had thought of the explorer/Age of Discovery puzzle myself. (I run a brainteaser-oriented game night in Manila.)\n\nI like how the Compass mechanic works, in general. It's a neat way to bridge the story and gameplay elements.\n\nBonus points for the puzzles that make use of real-world outside resources: Google Maps, Wikipedia, even TripAdivsor (one puzzle involves searching for a review posted by an NPC) It's quite a bold risk because it involves user-generated content that might end up getting deleted, later on. But for now, it feels inspired.\n\nThe Bad: The over-reliance on AGS-style connect-the-squares mini-games. Gets hella repetetive, especially in the late game. There's some occassional wooden voice acting, which I can forgive.\n\nThe stuff that makes this game unplayable at times comes from sloppy QA, rather than poor creative decisions by the devs. So it falls under...\n\nThe Ugly: At least four of the expert-level/hard-mode puzzles are basically unsolvable because of poor implementation. I can't go into detail without spoiling it, but have a look at the discussion for this game, if you want to get an idea.\n\nThe most obvious example are the hints for a mid-game puzzle involving book titles. The in-game tips make reference to books that aren't even mentioned in the puzzle!\n\nAlso, the Achievements seem to be completely bugged. NOBODY has been able to get them, so far.\n\nBased on other people's feedback, I get the impression that the original Italian version may have better quality control.\n\nIt's a shame -- I *really* wanted to like this game. The premise and gameplay have SO MUCH appeal to me. But the actual execution is unacceptably sloppy.","December 21, 2015","false","6.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warmwarmerdisco/recommended/310460/","warmwarmerdisco","Disco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warmwarmerdisco/","935 products in account","This is a fair warning to all Corto Maltese and point-and-click genre fans rather than a review of this game.\n\nWhy? The game simply won't work. What you get for a full game price is a Corto Maltese screensaver because it gets stuck on a loading screen and refuses to go any further than that. It's been at least one full week since the issue has been known and except for two humble "we're aware and working on it" replies on Steam forums there is no clarification on what could possibly be the problem. There is no official warning (in a form of a stickied discussion or a news post) and the Steam store page won't let you know of this unless you go into game's Community hub to investigate on your own.\n\nI feel bad for everyone who bought this for a full price since the Steam Winter sale is right around the corner and there are chances of this game being discounted at least for the sake of selling more copies of this unreasonably priced Corto Maltese screensaver.\n\nSome might say "have some patience for god's sake, don't be a crybaby, they will fix it!", well, I am patient but I feel it's also my duty to let other people know that they will be buying a game that most likely won't run. I like Corto Maltese and I like crime solving games so I had high hopes when I got this, but now I know for sure that I will enjoy this game way less than I could because of this unpleasant experience. Wasn't the game tested before it's release? I couldn't come up with a single excuse or an argument in developer's defense even if I really wanted to.\n\nIn addition, I wouldn't be writing this for everyone to see if there was an official statement from developer/publisher. Again, a stickied discussion or a news post saying something like "yes, we screwed up, we are sorry, have a pretty concept art picture to look at while we fix it" because that's what I saw other developers do when they are delaying game's release or working on patches. It's called common courtesy in my book. I suppose with all these ways to communicate directly with your audience we have nowadays, a simple seller-consumer communication is too much to ask for.","December 17, 2014","false","8.3"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","30","49","2","0"

Some other reviews and posts\nin the Forums suggest that it is not, though.\n\nWhat I CAN do is to warn everyone away who HASN`T heard\nof Corto Maltese before. The story MIGHT make some sense\nfor those who know Corto but for those who don`t, it is a\nvery confusing and downright frustrating Experience.\nIt doesn`t help that the Translation (into English at the least) is horrid mostly.\nYou are able to puzzle out what the Characters want to say but\nit is a truly cringe-worthy Effort to do so.\n\nI give the game points for trying to be creative in some of the\npuzzles and always offering easy and hard puzzle-paths but that\nis the only positive thing about it.\n\nTL; DR:\nDo NOT buy this unless you are either someone who wants to\nown everything Corto Maltese or are intrigued by Puzzles that\nneed Research outside of the Game. For everyone else you should\nstay far, far away.","September 20, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"
