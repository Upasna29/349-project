Everything works as intended now!!!\n\nEver wanted to know what Cool Boards 1, 2, & 3 on the PSX would be like on the PC.. This is it.. Let the nostalgia begin\n\n\nControls 4/5 : Simple to use on a xbox360, a bit more trickery with the keyboard.\nSound 3/5 Music isn't bad, Sound Effect are basic. All it all it works for the game.. It keep ya going.\nGraphics 3/5 Its above average then most Unity Games have.. Nothing special but nothing ugly ether.. The Gameplay makes up for it all\nGameplay 4/5 This is where the game shines.. The game play is solid...for the most part.. Sure, due to some Level designs and the limitation on the Editor you can find yourself doing all sort of weird stuff like shooting right outside the level at ridicules speeds.. The game play is a blast, from speed runs to Racking up trick points... and with the community made levels the replay value is through the roof.. never a dull moment...oh can’t forget the Local 4 players at once on the same screen.. This is a great little party couch game just in time for every one looking at getting a Steam link/machine.\n\n\noh did I mention the LVL editor... board? build your own. Easy to use..\n\nAll in all  despite it being built on unity (unreal would have been way better IMO) this game is worth the price tag, from unlimited replay value, Pick up and play and local multiplayer. the only thing missing is Online play.\n\nOverall 4/5","September 9, 2015","true","10.1"," 39 of 60 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","39","60","3","11"

I've wanted a decent snowboarding game on PC ever since I can remember.\n\nThis... is what I want? Stay with me.\n\nThis game FEELS almost good. It ALMOST feels like an SSX game. I think this game suffers a bit from what I call the Coolboarders syndrome in where you remember it being good and enjoying it. But in retrospect you didn't. Not at all. And enough time has passed where you only remember thinking you had fun. Only that all happens within minutes.\n\nThis is a mobile port with some added controls which is fine. There are plenty of great mobile games, the platform itself is not indicative of poor quality. Although maybe for the genre it is. Overambitious. The game is very simple. It works. The UI is very large and very bubbly for obvious reasons of mobile gaming.\n\nThere is a split screen multiplayer. But in all honesty I'm not sure why you would do such a thing to your friends. You might not use that as a designation for each other afterwords.\n\nThere is also a level editor that isn't terrible; it is sufficient in making a level that is noticeably different than other ones. The thing is, this game is trying to hard. Its trying to do everything and thus only does those things sub par if at all. Everything is functional at best.\n\nI was truly surprised when I went back to visit the store page to have it revealed to me that this was not still in early access. What even more surprising is I have had more enjoyment from this game than SNOW. But that story is for another time.\n\nI am honestly torn about this game. It feels good. Sort of. Good enough. Its silly, it has the strange and goofy characters needed to maintain that sentiment. It reminds me a little of TrackMania in the way that if this game had a larger community there could be a plethora of insane crazy stages that mess with the physics and probably some other ideas that people who are more creative than me can come up with. The thing is, its kind of a barren wasteland. And for that reason I cannot recommend this game without that level of curation or group of creators backing it constantly making new levels. And in all honesty I don't see it developing that audience. It needed that from the get go. You can't manufacture interest I suppose.\n\nTHE GIST\nThis game is totally fine as a product that exists and can be purchased. But for many reasons I HIGHLY recommend that you do not purchase it. Go eat a sandwich instead. You'll come away from that experience much more fulfilled. Pun intended.","February 20","false","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

Like probably everyone else that bought this game or had it wishlisted, I was hoping for an SSX-type of game -- in my case for the open world racing, as I don't care about tricks. Unfortunately, with those expectations in mind, Mad Snowboarding ended up being a huge disappointment.\n\nNote that I only played this for about half an hour, but it says something that by the end, playing to see what else this game offered was was quite a chore -- I would even characterize it as painful. I was bored out of my mind. In the levels I played, the world was very plain and dull. It isn't as "open" as it looks, and I quickly ran into "walls" when going not that far left or right. This is basically a really, really boring demo.\n\nIn my case, I bought this as a spare bundle key for about $0.20, so I'm not crying. But I would definitely encourage anyone wanting to pay full price to watch a lot of videos of this game and reading some of the more critical reviews before pulling the trigger.\n\nAgain, I only played half an hour, but half an hour into a game ... if it is that painfully boring, I find it hard to believe that the game would change dramatically after that. Maybe those creative types who enjoy designing stages and playing user-created levels will get more enjoyment out of it.\n\nSeriously, why doesn't EA bring the SSX series to Steam? Even a port of an older SSX game will do. As it is, I suspect a lot of people will pick Mad Snowboarding up on sale to satisfy their SSX itch and end up disappointed.\n\n1/10","March 26","false","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes. Does that mean Mad Snowboarding is worth $8.99? No. If only a little more work had gone into it to make things more complex and interest, it could be a decent budget title. Hell, it could be a decent budget title I'd happily give a thumbs up to if it was much cheaper, but frankly, there's a sea of better stuff you could spend that money on. Mad Snowboarding just does not give you enough bang for your buck.","April 28","false","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
