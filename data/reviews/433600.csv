Blinking between rooms is much easier now and encourages full exploration of the map. Enemies appear life-size and the boss fights are an intense yet fun ordeal as they should be. Each boss almost towers over you. Excellent! Two-thumbs up!\n\n***Old Review*** Looks like good fun, however I was a little discouraged starting out. Moving from room to room felt like too much labor on my part. Each room that is entered places the player with his back turned to the enemies. I just had to learn to stop facing the door when I blink to the next room. One possible fix is to let the player make the doorway selection from a distance. I'd like to see that as an option in a future update. (My explanation is in the comments.)","April 8","true","3.0"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","2"

It is a spectacular randomly-generated dungeon game that now even has mod support so that it can be expanded and remixed by end users.\n\nIf you like Binding of Isaac, classic Legend of Zelda games, rouge like games and other dungeon crawls, A Legend of Luca is a title I would absolutely recommend.\n\n\n","May 2","true","0.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

This results in a room that is 6 times as wide and long to run around in.  This lets them put more objects and enimies in a single room.  It kind of feels like you're running around on a game board with real traps and enemies, which is very cool!  It's hard to explain, but very well executed IMHO.  I find that I am more active (running around) in this game than any other that I've played except for maybe Space Pirate Trainer (and I've played almost all of them).\n\nThe combat is pretty straight forward.  You start off with a magic staff that shoots energy balls in the direction you point it.  You have bombs that blow up blocks like in Zelda.  You eventually get a malee weapon for your second hand and thats when it gets real intense.  That's as far as I've made it so far, but I can't wait to get the other weapons and give them a go.\n\nI highly recommend checking it out if you're into a Zelda-type dungeon crawler that is focused on action.  There isn't really any story to speak of, other than some short narration, but hardly a deal breaker in my book.\n\nMain take-away:  VERY FUN!!!","April 10","true","3.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It still has some kinks to work out, but I think the developer has some very interesting ideas.  It's really cool to see a VR rogue-like like this, and it has a lot of replay value and that "let me try one more time" vibe.\n\n\n\nThe game has you adjust the height of the floor up to around your waist to provide a first person perspective.  This works quite well in regards to allowing you to walk around the space - but it does make you feel a bit bigger than normal.  If you approach the game knowing this, I feel that most of the negative reviews are not much of a concern.\n\nThe weapon collision against the green block and floor of the game, which makes you drop your weapon, can be a bit frustrating.  It's not a perfectly eloquent solution to preventing players from "cheesing" the game, but I can see why it had to be applied.\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nWow, you completely fixed the green block item drop thing in a way that I feel is very fair.  Making your weapon rubber band back is awesome!  This game feels even better now!  Great job!\n\nThere are also issues with going into a room and being attacked before you can react, if enemies get really close up on you, it can be hard to realize you should look down at your feet to see them due to perspective.  Hopefully as the dev continues to work on this title, the few niggles I have will be ironed out.\n\nOverall I am giving this game a positive review. Why?  Wasn't this review a list of things wrong with the game?  I'll tell you: It's really neat to play, it's challenging, and it has more replay value than some of the more demo-ish titles on the vive.  It really feels like a complete "game" in many ways- though I still feel that the dev should have put this as Early Access and continued to hone it into a finer blade!\n\nI'll put it this way, if the game was a 2d top down Gungeon / Isaac / etc. it would be getting substantially  higher reviews - but those games have been done over and over.  They are great, I absolutely love them, but this is something truly unique.  The challenges of locomotion and perspective in VR are definitely there, and this dev has some serious cajones for trying this idea!  We need to support devs that attempt creative and unique approaches to VR and there really is no single game on the vive that is like this one.   That doesn't mean it's perfect, but it earned my money by delivering something I've never experienced before.\n\nJust a side note to the dev: I know it can be discouraging to read negative reviews on your game.  Don't make the reviews constitute whether you should keep working on your game.  KEEP WORKING ON THIS.  You have something really unique here, and if you keep experimenting with the system you have I'm confident you'll create something even more special.  Personally though, I would lower the price a bit.  The "VR tax" as I see it can be a bit counter productive.  This game really should be on early access for 10 - 15. It's none of my business to determine price, and I'm happy with the product for what I paid (16.99 during the sale I believe), and I would have gladly paid 20, but just consider it if you're trying to make bigger sales and garner more reviews.  Sometimes in a new market you have to make your game "a steal" to stand out - as much as it sucks for all the time and hard work you put it into it.  As it stands only 12 reviews isnt going to show much, and that's quite a few for how limited the Vive market is at the moment.  I know this isn't really any of my business, it's yours, but I really want to see this game blossom even more into the must have title I think it deserves to be with the right polish.  Thanks for making this game!\n\nAnd thanks for the last update, which has made the game even more fun!","April 14","true","2.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

You navigate through a Zelda dungeon like map collecting treasures and new weapons with a real feeling of exploration compared to most VR games in which you teleport around that often breaks immersion.\n\nHowever, my gameplay experience was very different from the trailers and screenshots. The store page says the minimum requirement for this game is 2m x 1.5m but I later found the 'Additional notes' section which says the ideal play area is 4m x 2.35m. My play area is 2.7m x 2.7m and the world was scaled down so much that it felt very different from the trailers and screenshots. This downscaling caused difficulty in navigating through the room and avoiding enemy attacks. I think the minimum space requirement should be changed so that players get the intended experience rather than compromising the gameplay by scaling everything down.\n\nThe game itself looks great and I believe it would be quite enjoyable if I had the recommended play area, but I wasn't able to get the expected gameplay experience with the space available to me.","April 10","true","0.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

You can tell that the developer listens to his audience.  Originally the game was designed as being "a room-scale vr game" and after feedback, they have changed the game to teleportation controls.  I originally purchased this as I was intrigued by the thought of actually having to move around the room to play a game.  This wasn't ideal however when put into actual play, as the floor was set to be at waist level and you kind of felt like a god floating in the sky shooting at tiny beasts and skeletons.  I gave the game a break.\n\nThe developer then came out with new enhanced controls and scaled the game to be true size.  This seemed like a step in the right direction, but I had such difficulty fighting even the first boss using teleportation.  It felt like it needed much more tweaking.  Maybe this is just a knock against VR locomotion in regards to a fast paced action adventure game, but having to turn around after teleporting to fight a boss can get very disorienting.  I want to like this game, I really do.  The graphics and the amount of work the developer has put into the game is there; it just needs a tiny bit of extra work before I can give it my seal of approval.\n\nThank you for reading my review.","May 9","false","2.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

My play area is maybe 10ft x 10ft. More than enough space for first person with my other VR titles, but apparently not for this one. It made me drag the rooms up to my waist, which forces me to constantly keep my arms up like I'm a child splashing in the shallow end. If you don't know what I'm talking about because the game didn't make you do that, then lucky you.

Having just gone through Vanishing Realms, this title left much to be desired.

Layout of the game is just boring, endless labyrinth of grey stone 'levels'.

I thought the rooms would be the size of the play area but no, you have to teleport everywhere which makes everything super awkward. They have traps on the ground, but you can just teleport over them. Very dumb.\n\nNot to mention bad guys run inside of you. The AI is so lame and basic. Many enemies just stand there and let you shoot them, some run inside you. The game is very awkward.","May 13","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The closest analogy to what this game /actually/ is would be the original Legend of Zelda in VR.\n\nSound design is pretty awful. I'd expect the mixing to be better than it is (narration in-game is almost always timed/placed wrong, and can be barely heard) and the actual sounds used for enemies is awkward at best, and incredibly annoying at most. Enemies rarely actually hurt you, unless you step into their path. Instead of reacting to your actions, most just run around the room, turning combat into a "teleport, whack, repeat" affair, which rapidly grows old and painful to manage. Especially once you pick up the bow, one particular type continually brings in more of its own kind and runs away, repeatedly playing the same loud and very annoying noise.\n\nControls are also a bit awkward: it's very easy to teleport too closely to a wall and clip into chunks of geometry, or break the game a bit by teleport-glitching into spaces you shouldn't be able to go into. Worse, because of the avatar collider around your own body, physics debris from destructibles often results in items that can't be collected or reached.\n\nIt's a neat attempt at adapting the genre for VR, but needs quite a bit more work before I can recommend it. Definitely not worth the $20 asking price.","May 15","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The changes in the past two weeks have made the game feel much more polished, and if you tried this on the Vive launch day and weren't satisfied then I recommend you update and try it again!\n\nA Legend of Luca is a dungeon crawling game with ranged and melee combat - you start off with a staff which shoots magic, and later unlock a sword. Explore through a labrynth of connected rooms, defeating monsters and bosses, collecting loot and upgrades, and all sorts of other good things.\n\nThe game's design feels very unique, with the floor of the world being calibrated to your stomach.

It seems that the game scales according to the size of your room, but this was not made clear anywhere at the time of purchase, and it makes such a huge difference to the experience. In addition to the issue of how the world is scaled down so much, the game also seemed to lack depth, at least from the time that I spent with it. The music was repetitive and it felt very out-of-place, and the user interface was very poor with small and hard-to-read text.\n\nThis was all very disappointing for me, and I decided to get refund.

I purchased Vanishing realms earlier and was confused as to why both these games had the same monsters. Then I realized they may have come from an asset store. Legend of Luca does not use them in a good way. The weapons do not feel like you're making contact with the monsters, as they just pass through them.\n\nMonsters do not flinch when hit either, so all power in the swings feel lost. This is something Vanishing Realms does that works extremely well, and makes combat feel fluid. If this game did the same thing I would change my opinion very quickly.\n\nEdit: I am changing the review to reflect the fact that the developer seems to understand that some systems need fixing, and that he's making a huge effort to address them!

Rogue-like with randomly generated levels means a different experience each time\n-Intensity. That first time when the boss charges you and you jump into a wall to dodge do you realize how real it can feel. You can definitely work up a sweat.\n-Fun. Hard to put into words but you it feels like you're living the Legend of Zelda\n-Items lots of fun items in a similar vein to Binding of Issac (including one that changes your vision to wire-frame)\n-Weapon variety. Several different weapons can drop for you and since you can wield you two weapons there are quite a few combinations. I like the sword and staff (I like to think of it as Ganddalf style)\nI have not unlocked all the weapons or items yet after sinking a good amount of time in.\n-Dev work. Between April 11-15 2016, the Dev pushed out a new version every day. To see such dedication after release really\n-Dodging focused combat. Vanishing Realms combat is focused on parrying and blocking. Space Pirate Trainer has bullet time. Hover junkers has cover.\nYou have none of these luxuries; you need to learn to dodge. At first this was frustrating as you need to move rapidly which means you can trip over your cord and/or run into a wall but once\nyou get the hang of it there's nothing quite like having to dance around a boss.\n\nThe bad:\n-Music. You'll hear the the same guitar rock solo over and over. I'd prefer it if the music was randomized (though I tend to listen to this instead\n-Enemies stand inside your hit-box. Often times an enemy will charge you and then stand inside you which makes it difficult to kill. It does train you to learn to dodge.\n-Difficulty. This game starts off way too hard. Less than 20% of the players who bought the game have beaten the first level (which is partially due to achievements being added recently).\nAt this point I get decently far every time and the Dev has certainly made the first level easier over the last few patches. It was a rough start though.\nVanishing Realms solved this problem by having a gem of regeneration at the very beginning (which made all the food items useless) as a way of choosing your difficulty and I think something similar\nwould increase the accessibility without ruining it for more serious gamers.\n-Always start with the staff. This is pretty normal in games where the starting equipment is always the same but I just wanna rock out as Gandalf in Hyrule listening to some 8bit.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nThis game has one of the highest time2money ratios of the games currently out (also recommend Audio Shield).\nWhile I wouldn't recommend it as your first VR game, I definitely recommend it as something that plays like a game instead of a tech demo","April 19","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
