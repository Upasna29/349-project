The sixth post down is Jason welge, details of his fraud in gaining assets created for this 'game' are given in detail:\nhttps://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?31395-Scam-Reports-amp-Tips&highlight=Jason+welge\n\nWe then have his criminal conviction of Grand Theft Property (more than $300 but less than $5000): http://openpasts.com/PublicRecord/JASON-WELGE/1301215733989\n\nWith his Kickstarter attempts listed here:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/profile/7547109/created\n\nIt is rumoured the kickstarters were a means of gaining legal fees, this however, isn't fact, but the timing is very 'unfortunate' as pointed out here: https://twitter.com/BroTeamPill/status/549991041420783617\n\nA great collection of photos by Bro Team Pill demonstrating how Jasons loves deceit and thinks everyone can be fooled by words that come out of his mouth: https://twitter.com/broteampill/status/550183967048355841\n\nA lot of good links here too:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2qwk5e/creator_of_4_failed_kickstarter_campaigns_starts/\n\nBut what does all this have to do with the game? Well simple, the game is as bad as his reputation, enemies spawn 2 feet away from you, the animations and 'game feel' just don't exist and it is obvious Jason has no knowledge of game design whatsoever.\n\nI say this a lot but never have I meant this with such passion. It's the worst attempt at a game I have ever played. A great video by 'Jim Sterling' demonstrates this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqFSNEKOlwg\nAlong with 'Unit Lost':\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJWhIrxyU4\nNeither are being bad just for the video either (notice how they both get to the same point and no further), the 'game' is actually that 'difficult' to play, as mentioned earlier, enemies follow no set rules, they just do what they feel like and the players sense of direction just doesn't exist, you have no idea of what to do or where to go.\n\nThe forums are full of censorship too, try bring up anything negative and it will be deleted and you yourself, banned. Luckily I expected this and archived the posts before they were deleted, look for yourself and make your own mind up as to whether he was right or wrong to delete these threads:\n\nhttps://archive.is/8mbGR\nhttps://archive.is/i5VTE - A post informing consumers of deletion of the EA forums. (Which got me banned)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JxoqbQz.png - Proof of my ban. (since lifted, the day after)\nhttps://archive.is/Tc1ot - The 'developer' denying banning or deleting any form of censoring on the forums after I was banned.\n\nSorry that this wasn't an indepth review about the game but when the game isn't there in the first place, and the developer is a known fraud, I would rather inform you of this and let other people/the videos I provided demonstrate the games quality.\n\nEDIT: The games cinematic annoyed me, it looked familiar but I couldn't place it until it clicked, its the Unreal Engine 4 tech demo, but reskinned! Here is the video comparing the two (thanks to Shinmai for providing a more appropriate video):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPdHXtTUUoA\nHere is proof I brought this up in the forums, only for it to be removed (the last post): https://archive.is/GQlmX\n\nSecond edit: Now banned from the forum for showing evidence of the developer being blacklisted: http://imgur.com/6Gnn0d8\n\nAs you can see, he likes to think that people are idiots, and that only his word is golden, not those that have actual proof of his misdealings.\n\nEDIT #2: According to community member Bisonfan95, the game doesn't have an ending and instead, simply loops back to the first level upon entering what is presumed to be the final section. I archived the forum topic as this is the second time I have seen this thread, the first was deleted before I even thought to archive it.\n\nTopic here: https://archive.is/Qp67Z a direct link to the youtube video he posted (incase it is needed) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z9U9pye9w and the llink to his review he mentions here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpfmb/recommended/290650)","April 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 671 of 684 people (98%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","98","671","684","47","40"

("high" and "low" is not graphical options, don't even try to kid yourself.)\n- Terrible optimisation throughout. (very high end GPU and CPU user struggling around 20fps... not good.)\n- Large amount of stock assets, those that are original are simply poor in every respect.\n- Awful graphical fidelity, with hugely varying texture resolutions.\n- Blinding use of ridiculous effects.\n- Gunplay mechanics are very poor with no realistic gun handling, just some up-kick and generic cone-of-fire.\n- Zombies often become invincible and glitch out.\nThis is just a basic run-down...

Then when I press start I'm dropped into the middle of some sort of desert/forest/lake area.  There's a short loop of a wind sound playing.  My character is holding his hand out like he's got a gun, but he doesn't.  There's a flashlight shining magically in front of me from out of nowhere.  As I clumsily climb a nearby hill through an obscene amount of motion blur I see a building in the distance but assume it's part of a flat skybox graphic because the depth of field is horrible and everything is deliberately out of focus.  As I head towards it I realize it is actually real.  I hear a weird noise as I cross a lake, then notice spider arms to the left and right of the screen as my life meter slowly drops.  I turn around but keep running backwards.  I see a giant...thing.  Maybe a spider?  Or a crayfish?  Can't be sure, but eventually it quits trying to softly hug me to death and runs away sideways for no reason at all.  After a long boring walk, I finally make it to the buildings.  I find a gun, and after much frustration realize I can pick it up by pressing E on my keyboard (no button on my Xbox 360 controller will do it).  A moment later everything freezes for a few seconds while the game loads up some music and an army of identical black zombies in orange jumpsuits.  As they slide unnaturally around the stage I shoot them and they begin to flop all over the place, stretching and morphing like blobs of silly putty.  Sometimes another spider-crayfish shows up and tries to hug me some more.  Sometimes one will shoot a fireball the size of a truck at me, and my graphics suddenly choke so bad I beg for the slip-sliding army of incompetent zombie clones and spider-crayfish to end my life.  Finally it happens and I quit.\n\nI do not understand what I've just experienced.  I got this game for free in some bundle, but somehow I still feel ripped off.","July 12, 2014","false","1.9"," 185 of 202 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","185","202","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeurnoire/recommended/290650/","Coeurnoire","Black Heart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeurnoire/","494 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d4RtvMQp10\n\nThis. So much this. Imagine the martians are PanzerGamingStudios and the computer is Unreal 4 and you have a clear idea of what's going on here.\n\nRead ahead if you like, but you shouldn't have to. It's that bad.\n\nFurthermore, on account of the fact that the developer's page doesn't have any emblems or information about their label, a link to website, anything to indicate that it's Panzer Gaming Studios other than the name panzergamingstudios, I don't trust them. I trust them less because the Store page shows some screenshots that are from the Unreal Engine 4 editor, not from the game.\n\nEDIT: PanzerGamingStudios clearly has never heard of the Streisand Effect, as his attempts to delete, ban, lock and otherwise suppress the DELUGE of negative press has only succeeded in... well... generating even more damning negative press.\n\n\nThe glaring issues with the game are as follows;\n-It is NOT FUN.\n\n-No 64 bit mode, which may help it's framerate some.\n\n-No Steamworks integration. Collector's cards work, but that's about it. You cannot take screenshots or access the overlay from within the game, on account of a DOS-based go-between program to launch the game. Nor does Print Screen take screen captures. It only captures a black screen. You literally need to have a very good third party video or screenshot application to be able to take ANYTHING you see in the game out of it.\n\n-Abysmal optimisation. Even on powerful current gen hardware the game lags horribly. The scripted in-engine introduction sequence has a framerate around 10FPS.\n\n-Even with it's horrid framerate, it is ugly as sin. You'd think that a game that drags your framerate down into the 10-20 range would be approaching photorealism, but this game is just... there are better looking games in Unreal 2. This game is built in Unreal 4. Just... yeah.\n\n-Mouselook arbitrarily stops responding for 1-3 seconds at a time.\n\n-Horrible screen and texture tearing.\n\n-The camera sometimes floats 'inside' the character, so you're looking through their arm.\n\n-Nonsensical writing. It might make more sense if a paranoid schitzophrenic had written it.\n\n-Braindead AI. The developer has attempted to hide the fact that the AI is beyond stupid by giving them way too much HP and hit way too hard, giving them game sort of artificial difficulty. The enemies are still as dumb as a bag of hammers and COULD be kited indefinitely. EDIT: You do not even need to fight the enemies. You can simply run past them to get to the next level.\n\n-Broken maps, repetative and unimaginative set pieces.\n\n-Special effects so bright as to be blinding.\n\n-The game is constantly changing. And by changing I don't mean mechanical tweaks, extra mobs, balancing, etc. The very layout of the game changes, as well as the combat system. It does not seem like the developer has any idea what they want the game to be.\n\n-The game locks up without warning to load. The developer informed me that this is a flaw in the design of all iterations of Unreal, but that there are ways to make it less glaring. None of which are being implemented. To be honest, with the exception of Space Marine I can't ever recall a video game built in Unreal locking up without warning to load the next area.\n\n-The music, while upbeat, is repetative and at times downright irritating to the point I mute the game.\n\n-Other sound effects are derivative, possibly even stock Unreal assets and annoying.\n\n-Broken magic system. Seriously, the game's unskippable introduction explains the magic system, but magic right now is completely unusable.\n\n-The single instance of voice acting in the game is terribly done. He might have been able to record better audio with a camcorder or iPhone. No really. It's THAT bad. You can even hear the mouse click when he began recording. That's how few f*cks he gave about it.\n\n-The one NPC in the game barely moves, and during the horrid voice acting his face does not even move, nevermind have any kind of lip syncing.\n\n-I'm pretty sure that the monster at the beginning of the game is directly ripped off from DOOM. (Hell Knight and Cyberdemon look EXTREMELY familiar, eh?)\n\n\nTL;DR - Calling this game Alpha build is a total lie. On account of it's handful of working maps that are constantly changing in design and layout, combat system in a constant state of being reworked, and overall being unplayable I would be extremely hard pressed to say that it is past pre-alpha, maybe even still in preproduction. It may have, at one point been a decent game when it was in UDK. But since having been rebuilt completely from the ground up in UE4, it's a disaster. This game does not belong on Steam.\n\nAlso;\n\nAwards\n1st Place Winner for Best Indie Game at Whitewater MAGD Awards (2013)\n2nd Place Winner for Best Indie Game at Whitewater MAGD Awards (2012)\n\nI recant my initial statement about this. Instead I submit that it is a complete lie.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BgTDLZq.png\nThis thread has since been deleted by the developer. An action that both proves my point in the reply, and compounds my lack of faith in him and his project.\nThe developer himself admits that the game that recieved these awards was A New Reckoning - UDK. This is A New Reckoning - UE4, a new game started completely from scratch in a new engine, unrecognizable compared to the game demo'd in Whitewater MAGD 2012 and 2013.\n\nFeatured in the Hollywood film festival indie movie of the year 2102 Starlet.\n\nThis is again a total lie, but it can't go overlooked that this developer is so unprofessional and careless that he doesn't even PROOFREAD or SPELLCHECK anything he says or does. How does this evade him? 2102 (Should be 2012) has been incorrect for days, maybe a week or more. I can't say I noticed when it went up, just that it's been there for several days and still lacks proofreading.

Time Ramesside is a horrible first person shooter first and foremost, but each and every iteration is different. Every update has a new start level and after spending more than twelve hours in the game and making extensive bug reports to the developers, I've still never once completed any of the dozen first levels that I've played.\n\nThis version is completely different than the last version I played two months ago. The game has been completed and finished for half a year now, but it continues to be worked on. Time Ramesside has gotten better yes, but for every step forward it takes a huge leap back and breaks its legs. Now that the game is finished its been announced this was only the first episode. I have a feeling that's their way of cutting the game into thirds without finishing it.\n\nThe last version I played started me off with an extremely long cut scene after another cut scene and on top of that was another cut scene. My player fell out of a small prison bus and made his way into a prison dodging cameras that would close the doors if he was spotted. Its odd that trying to get into a prison would close giant gates, but whatever. Why question the logic? The structures hovered above ground, but nothing was as bad as the spawning arachnids that could kill the player easy and spawn in right on top of him.\n\nOh but this current update has you in front of a prison on a bridge, but now its a warmer setting. The ground is covered with shallow pools of water and there is grass overtaking everything. Its abandon except for the flesh less zombies inside.the yard. These zombies spawn in mid air on top of one another so one can be hovering over a cluster of other zombies. This is nothing new. The animations look strange and stiff, but I suppose its better than the T pose they originally had.\n\nThat's one of the downfalls of releasing a game too early to the public. We get a chance to remember and sour future reviews. The developers would listen to constructive feedback and act like they'd do something about it, but at the end of the day when they put "resolved" on a bug in the forum it was never resolved so much as acknowledged yes this is a bug.\n\nThe controls are awful. Rather than typical strafe with the left and right, you're forced to turn with the left and right as if its the mid nineties all over again. Its quite a tease having rebindable keys that save, but you're still stuck with the default control scheme. There are also two different sections to rebind your keys when there only needs to be one. That's how flawed the game is when there are so many problems with the menus.\n\nAs you walk on the long bridge from a wrecked semmi into the prison you're greeted with floating text blurbs instructing you how to play. How to pick up weapons, use spells and hop into a wormhole for health. It just looks awkward having the floating prompts light signs rather than on your heads up display. This heads up display I should mention looks a lot better than it did before, which originally was drawn text and ugly simple shapes.\n\nAs a game, Time Ramesside is just dull. There are zombies and arachnids to shoot, but the real game here is playing spot the issues. Such as weapons to pick up that have blue boxes around them, but the blue boxes are facing a different way than the weapon. Tires that are in pavement and walls that hover in the air. There are also invisible walls blocking obvious doorways.\n\nOne plus is that the needlessly long cut scenes have been removed. Perhaps they were just moved further into the game. I'd much rather have a game to play than get lost in the cut scenes.\n\nTime Ramesside is also a game known for its stock assets and I have no problem with that, but just make a good game to compensate for it. You can make something good, get money for it and then add custom models, textures and everything afterward. All I want is an enjoyable game I can play, but this is at the bottom of the barrel. There is no program icon to the game and its still known as "shootergame-win-32-shipping." That alone is a testament to the quality you're getting.\n\nAnother thing that makes this game an unyielding beast is the file size compared to what you get with the game. Its just a far too huge game for the low quality of its assets. Even with the highest settings it looks sub par for the large file size. That's the fault of the high quality engine though as is the texture pop in. When larger developers struggle with the same thing its tough to hold that against Time Ramesside.\n\nI've seen this project for far too long and while it has gotten marginally better over the past six months, its still a horrible game. I doubt the developers have the talent to make it any better than it is. However, they do seem determined to keep pressing on, so that's always a positive. The only catch now is they're pressing on with the second episode of a game so bad it should be legendary if only it was better to be legendarily bad. Does that even make sense?\n\nThere's no flair, passion or zest here. Even with a completed game it was still dead on arrival to an angry mob. A second episode will only yield the same results. The developers will make a great looking trailer of footage that I'll be unable to find in the game when I play it.","July 15, 2014","false","13.9"," 109 of 124 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","109","124","0","11"

Supported them with crash reports on forums and tipping bugs. Actually I waited until the full release before writing this... Nothing changed much. I am so glad I got this on a bundle and not paying the full ridiculous price.\n\nCons:\n-You can pass 95% of the levels running away.\n-First of all, FPS GAME WITH NO OPTION TO CHANGE MOUSE SENSIVITY??? REALLY???? ._.\n-Then graphics, just... let's say that Gears of War PC 2007 (using an older unreal engine) has a million times better graphics.\n-Animations: from nill to slim. Reloads are so bad that become hilarious. THE SNIPER SCOPE IS A JOKE, LITERALLY. AK-47 RELOADS LIKE A SHOTGUN.\n-Story: It has slides, SLIDES with all the story on it at the beginning.\n-Performance: Mi PC can run Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes with max graphics and becomes slow with this game... Ha-Ha.\n-HUD: 2 health bars LOL.\n- No explicit or implicit tutorials of the game mechanics. You just have to guess and review the key bindings screen.\n-Default keybindings are so... inappropriate. "Q" brings up the menu. Do I need to say more?\n-Inconsistent gameplay: sometimes the weapons do lots of damage, sometimes they don't. You can jump like on Halo sometimes... other times you barely jump at all.\n-Level design: Incomplete and a guesswork if you want to trigger the level transition.\n\nPros:\n-Best example on how not to make a game with Unreal Engine.\n-New record on bad games.\n\nSeriously, I'd rather score a point on "Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors: Desert Bus" or play "Big Rigs" 8 hours straight. The Angry Videogame Nerd needs to review this ASAP. I'm going to try to actually finish this game in the name of my obsessive completionism.

Only thing that makes this case astonishing is the fact that the game is broken beyond repair and the dev is literally deleting forums because he doesn't like negative feedback.\n\nMy involvement with A New Reckoning came about when I saw Jim Sterling cover it in a Squirty Play. It looked godawful and I had to check the Steam page for more information. After experiencing firsthand how ready the dev is to censor his critics and prevent as much criticism as possible I had enough. He had banned me from the forums for simply saying I was going to review the game. This is my hoorah, my big step against this developer. This game is so bad typical critique conventions don't even come into play. There is no game to critique, it has awful controls, no rebinding, TWO graphics options and literally broken combat(magic currently doesn't work) The FPS is incredibly low for something that looks like its from a bargain 2001 PC game and it crashes constantly(10-15 times during my recording of footage). This game is beyond trash and the fact that it exists on Steam is pure heresy.

When you first launch the game you are shown a crappy menu with 4 buttons on a static screenshot of the game. Starting up a new game, the game freezes and loads for almost 2 mins even with a SSD. When it finally loads you get a slow and laggy intro movie with horrible animations and special effects. After the movie is over the game then loads once again, introducing you to a slow moving camera overview. When first playing I had a hard time seeing around me due to the dense crappy frozen fog effects. Once I ran through the series of doors, I lost control of my player and once again it switched to a slow moving camera of the first mob you will attack.

A New Reckoning looks and feels like an alpha tech demo from 2001, I don't even know where to start to explain how bad this game is.\n\nFirst of all; It doesn't matter how fast your machine is, this game will load extremely slow.\n\nAfter the intro that makes absolutely no sense at all, you may begin a new game (if you haven't already quit by then).\nYou start in a bus, for no reason whatsoever (i guess  its suppose to be a jail bus or something). First thing you notice the hideous graphics (if you havent already noticed them in the intro). You try to raise your resolution but to your surprise, nothing changes.\nWell ok, this is still a work in progress, so let's not be too hard on this game.\nThen you'll notice 95% of the sounds are not even in the game (yet). The only sounds that probably work are sounds of shooting and footsteps.\n\nIf you're still 'playing' the game..... well .... sorry i mean; If you're still torturing yourself, you try to checkout the other options in the options menu to find out you can't customise the controlls and have no idea what to press. Somehow the gate opens and behind the gate there's another fence you're suppose to teleport over. I pressed all the keys on my keyboard to figure out what to teleport key was but i couldn't find it. I tried to locate it in the  "Spells" menu but still didn't knew how it would work. So eventually i just stop trying. Also there are so many weird things in the game like ... Weird snowbushes or whatever they are suppose to be or Door textures that are simply way too small for an adult to get in...\n\nI have played this game one time before and back then I already knew this game was never going to be any good. But i gave them another chance months after release just so I was sure I could put this game in my 'hidden' list. I could tell you about the enemies but.... do you really want to know ? Ok well... the shooting is unsatisfying and the enemies are the regular bunch you can find in any game like Scorpions...... and they live in the snow somehow. The game is not "So bad, it's fun", the game is just extremely bad and it should be banned from Steam.

First of all the options only allow you to change the graphical settings of the game, you can't change the volume or any settings related to the controls. When you start the game, you notice a complete lack of a difficulty setting. The game starts with a very poor and confusing cutscene. After the cutscene I encountered the following issue: a complete lack of a tutorial or even a keymap. So I had to try every button to attempt to pick up a weapon, which was sticking out of the ground. The controls of the game are illogical as 1 was used to grab a weapon, 2 to switch weapons and q for the main menu, since esc doesn't even work...\n\nA short summary of my experience:\n\nPoor\nLack of options\nLack of a tutorial\nLack of difficulty settings\nPoor graphics\nLack of a purpose (first level)\nTerrible HUD\nUgly menus\nNo attack animation (for the zombies)\nWeird cut-scenes\nBlack borders in full screen\nLooping sounds\nUnclear HUD\nGlowing items you can't pick up\nFloating ammo\nGood/Mediocre\nI kinda liked the music\nHas trading cards\nOnly got the game because it was in a bundle\nDeveloper actively tries to improve the game","December 17, 2014","false","1.6"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","5"

X has never moved you backwards. What you saw was a typo, and in that case with that typo being almost or well over a month old. I see here you have not played the game in the past 2 weeks. If you did you would notice X fires of a Spell from the RPG system. Yes that is correct a RPG system is being developed right now. I strongly suggest you update your review. I normally just leave reviews alone and learn from them however considering these circiumstances I think you did this just out of ignorance. If not that this review never would have been posted because X again has never moved you backwards like ever."\n\n\nSo.... according to the developer, this was a massive typo, and I should not post reviews / comments unless I have played the game within the last two weeks. The developer has strongly suggested that I update my review.\nHowever, what the developer seems to forget that their videos are an indication of the game as a whole and as such should be quality assured and checked for such errors. Failing to do this will result in some pedantic Steam user (Me) pointing this out.\n\nMy comment above was actually questioning the validity of the information shown in the video. Surely Kickstarter and crowd sourcing models should accept questions of this kind, so that the typos / videos / errors can be corrected. Unfortunately, Panzergamingstudios seems to think that this is a just a reason not to leave a review alone and resort to calling me ignorant and suchlike.\n\nI freely admit to not having played the game for a while, because when I did play it, it bore no resemblance to any of their promotional videos. I posted this comment whilst reviewing the latest updates, to see if it was worth me reinstalling the game to try again.

The entire world appeared to be made up of grey drywall, and for inexplicable reasons anything that looked remotely interesting was kept out of reach by invisible walls. The enemies were fine, if you were playing Doom on your 386. The sound, also, seemed like it was supposed to be retro, except it wasn't. I can't think of anything good to say about this game.

But at the cost of the whole story. Everything has changed. Literally every, last, thing has changed. No powers, no bus in the middle of a winter storm, no guy randomly punching you and walking out; the story changed completely... but the game still isn't worth your money.\n\nEdit:\nSince writing this, I have played the game more and my opinion remains the same. The game lacks a lot of animations, there are many bugs regarding AI, the control scheme still needs to be ironed out, and just in its entirety the game needs a ton of improvement before it can be considered market-ready.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFirst off, I did not play this game for more than 10 minutes. That's because half of the time was spent sitting through a black intro screen that cannot be skipped (which apparently is due to an issue with Unreal Engine), and the rest of the time was spent running around with a knife held as though a rifle was in its place.\n\nThe game starts you off, upon launching the game, with a small command prompt box. No complaint there, if it has to be there then it has to be there. Then it opens the actual game menu window. This menu window's "options" button did not work, so I couldn't go to full screen from there. No biggie. Press new game and now you wait through the aforementioned intro. When it's finally over, you "wake up" (I don't know what led to the protagonist being dropped off there) in a prison/dungeon of some sort with a crossbow at your feet.\n\nPressing esc gives you one type of game menu. Pressing Q gives you an alternate game menu. Both have different options inside of them, so that's really weird by itself. In neither can you change your keybindings, so whatever the developer has set is what you're stuck with. Speaking of the keybindings, there is no tutorial (to my knowledge) on what the controls are. Instead, you have to awkwardly walk up to the aforementioned crossbow and ask yourself how to pick it up. Only to fail to even accomplish that task, since after pressing all buttons on my keyboard and mouse, I failed to do even that.\n\nI figured maybe it's just a prop and can't actually be used, so instead, I ran with this knife being held oddly like a rifle and for every enemy I ran into, this annoying whispered "I'm going to kill you" was sounded. There's more to mention, like how crouching does nothing except change the positioning of your camera so you can see your own character's textures, and how the enemies don't seem to hurt you unless they align themselves perfectly to really get the damage done, and how the animations are minimal at best. However, I think with the other reviews and everything else considered, the point is clear.\n\nDon't release unfinished games. At the very least, get the HUD finished and the basic features ironed out. This game is truly not ready for the market. Fortunately, I only got it in a bundle, so it wasn't much of a bite from my wallet.\n\nOh, and changing the game's name is definitely suspect.","November 18, 2014","false","3.1"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","5"

I watched it update a few times a week, so I figured that there was a lot of progress being made.  It used to be called A New Reckoning, but I'm guessing the developer changed the name to Time Ramesside, whatever that means, to try and ditch the bad press that the game had earned.  I hadn't played it until the name was changed, and with all of the updates I saw it download onto my computer, I can't imagine what the game must have been like before all of these updates.  Let me just say that in game, it looks pretty nice, but it has a lot of problems.  The menu system looks like it was something made in flash, pretty dull and basic, often times buttons won't work at all.  When you hit the new game button it brings you to a black screen and you'll hear music playing.  Nothing else happens.  I alt+tabbed to find a solution, and after about 5 minutes of searching I found that the game had finally began.  Just takes 5 minutes to load the first level.  The weapon you start with is a knife, although your character doesn't seem to know that, because his hands are stuck as if he were trying to cradle the invisible barrel of a gun.  The AI is very stupid, the guns feel over powered, or under powered.  The first weapon you get is a crossbow that fires plasma rockets, the second is a pistol that takes 10 shots to kill an enemy.  You have to use P in order to pick up a weapon which I had to look online because theres no way to change or even check keybindings.  Just overall a lot of issues, and unpleasant controls/keybindings that you can't change.

The game has effects taken from this example project sprinkled throughout, but I didn't think he would have imported the /entire/ example project. No wonder this game is a 2.9GB download (the Install window claimed it unpacked to almost 10GB).\n\nIt's just poorly made, poorly thrown together trash. Not even IndieDB would accept this.\n\nedit: Also the entire thing is built on top of the C++ ShooterGame example project, multiple skills didn't work, and whoever made this literally put in the bare minimum amount of effort.","August 1, 2015","false","2.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","15"

It has changed tremendously since I first played the game in July, 2014. Have the changes been good? No, not at all. I have played several different versions of this game, not 1 has been worth my time. The lag is terrible, you get stuck on the ground, the zombies slide around rather than walk, the spider warps around and is too hard to kill. If you're lucky enough to kill the first spider you soon find out that there 2 more of the d*mn things! Thats the first level of the released game. The last time I played, you started in the prison, the time before that a bus. Its a clunky, laggy, unenjoyable mess that wishes it was a game.\n\nThe first time I played this there were not any enemies except for some zombies on the other side of a fence that was bulletproof. I walked aimlessly around and finally found some zombies (I think there were around a dozen) that didnt attack just shuffled along bumping into walls. None of them reacted to gun shots, none of them tried to attack, so I shot 'em all, walked around a bit longer, found nothing of interest then quit. I tried this again, crash! crash! crash! very unstable POS. I know that its EA, but come on! Make at least enough of a game (its not a game, not even a decent demo) that the players get a good sense of whats supposed to be going on in the story/game. I love zombie games and I have quite a few, one thats EA and its a great game. So happy that I didn't pay for this out-right, it was in a bundle.

The only redeeming factor so far from what I see from this game is that it has trading cards (already got 3, 2 more to go). They will make excellent marketplace fodder (hope I hit a foil, will sell it for $10 or more cause money spent on a foil card is probably alot more valueable than this).\n\nCons: Took awhile to download (over 2 hours of my life to download and install), only to be faced with a weird startup. When it starts up, it doesn't just open the game, it opens up a command prompt window that says "Launching game, 32-bit". Okay, I have a 64-bit OS, but whatever. Then the game window pops up. Now I'm on the...title screen? Wait, where's the title? All I see is "New Game", "Load Game", "Continue", "Options" and "Quit". Oh, I think I'll adjust the options, it's what I always do when I first start-up a game, I like to crank everything to the max since my PC can handle any game that gets thrown at me. *Clicks Options...click...click click* Hm...that's weird, the options button doesn't work? And I'm stuck having to place this game in windowed mode in which the bottom portion of it is going past my start bar? Well, I'll let this slide for now. After all, the game is still in development, so let's start a New Game and see what this game is all about. *Click "New Game"* *Goes to Black screen...* .....o...kay, I have a black screen....wait, I hear something...it's...a sound? Maybe music? But I'm not seeing anything....what's going on? Is this the game? To figure out why I'm staring at a black screen that after waiting like 5 to 10 minutes I'm still on a...black screen? *Presses random buttons* Um...okay...guess that's that *Exits game, restarts game, and sits on the so-called "title screen" as he types his review*\n\nAnd there you have it folks. Hope I didn't strain anyones eyes with my explicitly detailed typing about this game's cons. I was really looking forward to trying it, really, I was, I wanted to give this game a chance. But sadly, the game didn't want to give me a chance to play with it. 1/10 (it scores a 1 cause I at least am getting trading cards sitting on the title screen as I write this review, and surf, and do other "productive" things with my time as I wait for last card drop)","November 15, 2014","false","1.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

I was taken aback by a non-functional options screen at the opening menu. Actually that should have been my first clue of what was to come when I selected "New Game". Sort of like the scary music which plays in Grade-B horror movies as the nubile co-ed climbs the stairs to check on someone. You're yelling at the TV screen: "Don't go up the stairs" because we all know what's waiting at the top of the stairs. I wish someone had been yelling to me: "stay away from this half-finished piece of umm, garbage". But the video looked interesting so I blindly bought. They say one's born every minute. I could go on to list the many faults of this game that I encountered in the first fifteen minutes of play. Others have already done a more than adequate job. It takes a really terrible game before I'll stop playing without giving it a chance. This beast is one such game. If you think you might like to experience this game, whack your head with a mallet until you're unconscious.

It's early access, yes, but this is ludicrous.  This shouldn't have been eligible for early access in this state.\n\nI got this game in a bundle so I'm not too upset, but for those of you looking at this game just walk away.\n\nThe graphics are from 2002, the voice acting is terrible and you can tell it's some guy on a webcam mic(you can even hear his mouse clicking to read the next page of text)  The animations and cutscenes are dreadful, gameplay is a joke and overall this is worth nothing.  The controls are absolutely horrid and a lot of keys are, by default, double-mapped(so Q has 3 functions every time you push it) and the camera effects are amateur to the point of being offensive.   The music sucks too.\n\nThe gameplay is a first person shooter mixed with spell casting, something we've been seeing in Half Life mods since the early 2000s, and it almost rips off doom, this is tired and there is no fun or innovation, or even a nostalgia factor, it's just bad.  The level designs are bad and this game is so badly optimized you will fight the lag to even play.\n\nThe only good point I have is that I haven't found any bugs(lag aside), but I'm not going to play this mess for long so if you play for more than 30 or 40 minutes then I would expect a handful of bugs, at least.\n\nMaybe once they get more into development they'll add facial animations and proper voice acting, but THIS is not something that will bring a good mark of faith, there is literally no fun to be had and I doubt anyone would get behind this 'thing'.\n\nJust stay away.  If someone tries to give this game to you say 'no' because you don't need this ♥♥♥♥ cluttering up your gaming collection.\n\nThis is abysmal.  Steam please regulate your Early Access titles a little more, people are being ripped off left and right.","August 30, 2014","false","3.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I don't like having to unrecommend an FPS game with a promising premise, but this game has far too many lazy technical and gameplay problems.\n\nSure, you have a few graphics settings - but they're clumsy - you can't turn off motion blur, instead, you have to click "low->medium->high->epic" on the settings and guess at which one might turn it off.   It does work well enough in 4K, but that's not the problem.\n\nThe developer was simply too lazy to "finish" the game.  Some scenes in the game look great!  And others look like utter crap - fuzzy textures on incomplete models clashing with highly polished jail cells and nice lighting effects.   What we're seeing here might well be the effect of introducing the developers to crystal meth halfway through the development cycle, which might explain the jekyll & hyde levels of quality and shabbiness.  You even have clipping issues when reloading your gun - jaggy polygons seen through your partially-invisible arm!\n\nGameplay is equally and inexplicably shoddy - it's the same effectively as 1996's Quake, from iD software (it's 2016 now).   You can run, jump, look up, look down, run over piles of bullets left around on the ground.   You fight some nicely modelled zombie things which disappear as soon as you shoot them!  I guess they spent the "develop a lying down corpse" budget on more crystal meth.   For some reason, in the first level, you're in some kind of jail/mental asylum full of zombies.  The cell block is around as big as New York City, which is weird, and not really much fun running around in this endless single path full of the same game assets again and again.\n\nSo, all in all, this might look great but it's not, it's awful.","March 26","false","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've tried, but something is wrong when the tutorial level has enemies with WAY too much health.  A tutorial level should help the player get adjusted to the game, and, in a sense, I suppose ANR's (A New Reckoning) tutorial level is no different.  You start by phasing through a bus door, the bus is surrounded by police cars, (which are not to appropriate scale to the character), and are greeted by floating text blocks which give you a run down how to select the 'teleport' spell and use it.  As of this writing, the UI is little more than text (I hope they get a rudimentary iconic UI up soon, as the text is dull and quite ugly, maybe a spell selection wheel with spells that are not available grey'd out.)\n\nAfter learning to teleport, you are invited into a building that opens the way to the rest of the map.  It is largely a walking simulator at this point, where you can marvel at indoor street lamps (the kind you see on the streets, generally not indoors), snow on the floor (though it has no way to get there), and some bushes curiously growing out of the snow.  After teleporting to the other side of a fence, I am attacked by a demon-thingy.  Simple affair, bullets, death, move on.\n\nAfter destroying the demon dog thingy, I am then accosted by a flaming spider of significant size.  As I fight it, it poops out smaller, not flaming spiders every time it teleports near me.  If you ignore the smaller spiders, they become a life syphon, and eat all your health.  I found myself unloading an entire clip just to get rid of one of the spiders.  Circle strafing and typical FPS skills don't count here, as the baby spiders stick to you like glue.  I died.  Quick.\n\nTrying again, I teleported up to the rafters in the building, so while the baby spiders couldn't reach me, I couldn't get any health pickups, and quickly ran out of ammo and spell juice.  I lobbed a couple fireballs at them, taking down two or three at a time, only to have flaming titan spider pop back next to me and poop out more.  I dropped back to the ground, and picked up the health pickups, and ammo, and was swarmed.  I died.  Again.  On a tutorial level.  No matter HOW GOOd or BAD a player is, they should NEVER fail on a tutorial level.  And if they do fail, they should be allowed to try whatever they are trying to do again, without having to be dropped back to the intro screen, or text, or whatever.\n\nRight now, the game plays like a bare bones Unreal game, without, well, the fun.  If you are thinking about getting this game, I would suggest not, but if you do, at least wait until:\n\n1.)  It's closer to completion\n2.)  It's on sale for really, really, really cheap\nor\n3.)  Know what you are getting yourself into.\n\nIt's not good, even for early access, not at this point, anyway.  And believe me, I am a huge Early Access supporter.  I have many Early Access titles.  The congative dissonance I've witnessed from the developer in the forums (like those who do not like the game being called "trolls") is another turn off for me, and reminds me of a great quote I once read:\n\n"If one person has a problem with you, it's likely their fault.  If two people have a problem with you, I can still give you the benefit of the doubt.  But if three or more people have a problem with you, the problem probably lies with you."\n\nA vast majority of the reviews, even for an early access game, seem pretty negative for this title.  Many games that are early access, if their supporters see potential in the game, regardless of the bugs or lack of polish (Look at The Forest, or Dead State, or Dungeon of the Endless, or 7 Days to Die, etc etc) they will still net largely positive reviews.  That says something, doesn't it?","September 25, 2014","false","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

HOLY ♥♥♥♥. If your game is so bad that I literally cannot get more than a few minutes in without completely giving up, you have hit an absolute new low. I can't even possibly imagine that this game was made as a ♥♥♥♥ing SOURCE mod, much less a full-fledged UNREAL 4 game. Ugh.\n\nIn the 10 minutes or so of playing the game I experienced:\nDisgusting main menu with no music, backround visuals, nothing\nHorrific framerate, no matter what I did\nGraphics that look like something out of 2005\nNo story whatsoever\nBoring initial setting\nClunky and awkward cutscenes and gameplay\nGetting killed by the first enemy\n\nBUT\n\nThe weapon switching is pretty cool.\n1/10\n","May 12, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You'll find it's neither engaging nor original, and needs serious help in execution.  It's obvious the developers have no handle on how to tell a story that's interesting, visually or otherwise.  Save your money, or grab this as part of a bundle.  You'll be disappointed with this offering either eway if you ever manage to really get it running.\n\nOriginal: Indie Gala's Blood Knights Bundle had this 'Early Access' game featured alongside games like Syberia II, Zeno Clash 2, Rock of Ages, Blood Knights, M.U.D. TV, Gearcrack Arena, and Oinken for about $4.99, so - like many others - I really got 'A New Reckoning' by chance and can't honestly evaluate the price point for this in-development, early access game.  My system isn't the beefiest, but it can handle Wolfenstein: The New Order on medium resolution settings without a hitch.  With 'A New Reckoning'  I can't get through the inital cut-scene without my system's resources dwindling down to nothing.  Everything I see stuttes and hiccups on the monitor in front of my eyes.  Upon changing resolution settings, I get more of the same.  To be fair, I'm going to reserve any judgement against this game until I can actually play though it on some level a meatier system or determine if that actually alleviates the issue.  I will update this review once I'm able to play through some of the core game and evaluate this new build against the old build.","July 20, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No. This game is not worth anything at the moment.\nRight away you get thrown into the game with some weird... weapon?... You have over 9000 "bullets" with it... but it's not a ranged weapon. It's a melee weapon... So, that doesn't make any sense.\nThere's no tutorial. So, I wondered why the game was so dark... Turns out you have a flashlight.\nThe only enemy I found was some sort of soldier with red eyes that just repeated "I will kill you" over and over again. The enemies can't walk through doors either so you can stand at the entrance to a room and basically hit the enemies without taking damage.\nThere's a lot of bugs in the game as well. I went into a room and it repidly said "I will kill you" over and over again multiple times for no reason. I then ran out of the room and in again to find an enemy.\n\nI played this for like 15 minutes and then I idled it on the main menu to get trading cards.\n\nTl;dr:\nIt's a bad game with a lot of bugs and you shouldn't buy it.\n\nPros:\nIt has trading cards\nIs a bit spooky. Nothing big though.\n\nCons:\nBad controls.\nNo intro or tutorial.\nA lot of bugs.\nMissing textures.\nDoors look the same but you can open some of them and others you can't. (Let's play the "Find the right door" game!)\nBad music and sounds.\nBad textures.\nUltra quality textures in the game are called "Epic" (As in low, medium, high and epic) ... Yea, no. They're not epic.\nHorrible starting weapon with over 9000 bullets even though it's a melee weapon. (And I don't even know what it is)\nMain menu doesn't work properly: Click here for proof.[feen.us]\nGame opens up with this.[feen.us]\nThe game itself is titled "ShooterGame (32-bit, PCD3D_SMS)"\nIf you want to change the resolution of the game or even set it to window mode then you need to go IN the game and then open the options menu in there.\n\nOverall, a piece of something you shouldn't say.\nDo not buy this game...

You're trapped in a prison with a bunch of monsters and a little girl.\nPros\n-Great atmosphere.\nCons\n-The flashlight is located behind your machine gun causing a ton of glare on the front sight.\n-It's confusing as what you're supposed to do.\n-Shooting monsters is not fun as they don't hurt you, can trap you, and their death animation restarts every time you shoot them causing you to waste a ton of ammo.\n-The little girl has no point and you can clip through her.\n\nLevel 2 - Prison Level\nHere you start 10 minutes before the introduction. It's like the intro but now you aren't trapped.\nPros\n-Great atmosphere again\n-There's a story.\n-There's decent voice work.\nCons\n-There's no reason to shoot anything and you can run past everything.\n-Shooting stuff still isn't fun.\n-There's a hallway that looks spooky but when you go down it you realize it's actually a missing wall that takes you outside of the map.\n-Doors are broken. If you go up to a door and it opens go through it because if it closes you're never opening it up again.\n-Nothing is scary as the jump scares are cartoony compared to the rest of the environment, not sudden, and too far away.\n-It ends abruptly in a confusing way.\n\nLevel 3 - Outside city area\nYou're now outside on the city streets. I'm assuming because you escaped the prison even though it's not entirely clear.\nPros\n-Impressive variety of new monsters that, even though they're stock, fit quite well.\n-Lighting is nice and you can see where you're going.\n-Ammo is available on the ground.\n-There's a cool looking boss at the end.\nCons\n-Again there's no point to shooting things and there's no reason to anyway since it's way too open.\n-Because of the above this level is extremely boring.\n-There's no point to the boss fight as you can run past and end the level.\n\nLevel 4 - Condemned building\nThis time you're in an abandoned building. This is by far the best level in the game.\nPros\n-Excellent atmosphere\n-The hallway is narrower so you have a reason to shoot things.\n-There are open rooms that hold spooky set pieces.\n-Far more effort and planning then previous levels.\nCons\n-Shooting is still not fun due to animations getting restarted when you shoot as things are dying.\n-I didn't want to go into some of the side rooms because I didn't want to accidently break the game again and have to start over.\n-The ending is kind of bad and makes no sense at all.\n\nOverall Opinion\nEven though this game is now actually playable I still wouldn't recommend paying for it. It's currently at a pre-alpha state and $10 is a huge rip off. It's not what I'd call "fun" and still needs a ton of work. It's also really unoptimized so expect slowdowns like crazy in some spots. Level transitions are terrible as well and in some instances I wasn't sure if I was going to the next level or if the game froze on me.\n\nThat being said, the dev is going in the right direction with it and I'm really happy to see regular updates. I either died or got to the end of the game (I went down the hallway to the right) so I can't comment on if there's anything past level 4 as of yet. I'm putting it down as recommended only because it looks like Panzer Gaming Studios is trying to turn it into something and because I support indi devs.","December 13, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 27 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","2","27","0","0"

Keep in mind I am completely aware that this is an early alpha, and I'm loving every moment of this adventure.\n**not sarcasm...seriously**\n\n1: The first time I played this (back when it first got on steam), there was a cinematic with a bus ride, the bus exploded or something, and the game began. I walked into a city like environment, with a couple different guns, each with pretty descent looking particle effects, and tons of giant spiders coming at me. Clearly early alpha, but seemed like a good start. There was an actual hud, and what seemed like descent horde-like gameplay (reminded me a bit of a poor mans Pain Killer). I'll give it time come back to it a few months later...see how it progressed.\n\n2: I heard that Jim Sterling did a video on this. This was just a couple weeks ago. During Jims video you see a now stationary bus, with a guy on fire. The camera pans out of the bus, as if someone shoved the camera out of the back window of the bus, and the camera fell into the snow on its side. It or you stands back up, and you're in game. this time another snowy area, but with garages, some generic buildings, chain link fences, and some mismatched floors. After some walking, some zombies chased at him, then some spiders, and then a big spider who really liked to hump a rock. That was pretty much about it, no end of level, unless you count falling out of the level. I do not.\n\n3: So after watching Jims video I decide to boot it up again. This Time I'm greeted with something completely different. I'm seemingly inside one of the Bus garages from the Sterling video, but now its more of a super dark train station, with clippable trains. But there's some actual gameplay...sort of. I'm quickly greeted by dozens if not hundreds of zombies, demons, hospital gowned children, all running at me...then running past me. "OOOKIE", I thought to myself. Now I'm running and running past these guys, make my way out of the bus station, and meet up with a bunch of soldiers statically shooting handguns..sort of (the hands move, but the guns didn't). That was the end of the level. Next level seems to take me into a subway, which kept would just crash and took me back to the title screen. I hit continue ans I started back at the begginning again. ALT F4...try again later.\n\n4: I see another update for the game hit steam. Let's see if it's a different game this time! YUP! I start off in that Subway like level, the previous cityscape, bus, train station, and soldier all gone. Now I'm in a subway, and the game has a pretty cool opening which matched the design of this level. The HUD is missing though and replaced with just numbers and ugly boxes. But this time it's almost playable. The first level is pretty descent making my way around this subway like area, maybe a basement to a building, I'm not sure, but there's garbage EVERYWHERE! Tons and tons of garbage bags litter the place, but there's stuff to shoot, ammo to pick up, spells to cast, time to slow down, it's almost a functioning game. It was terrible, but I was almost having a good time (but I like bad things)...I even streamed it. The first level had an opening sequence with what seemed to be an actual story attempting to take place. I made my way through the first level, and started the second level. The game had new enemies, and this creepy guy who whispered loudly, "I WILL KILL YOU" ...actually kind of creeped me out a bit.\n\nBy the third level, I exit the the subway like area, and I'm now on top of a building. Demons all over, so I'm making my way through what seems to be an empty waiting line for a six flags ride, and come upon an elevator, that led down. I hop on the elevator, and it takes me to a storage room full of barrels and a giant door, door won't open, nothing to trigger the end of the level. That was that, but hey it was progress with about 45 minutes worth of glitchy but semi fun gameplay.\n\n5: Tonight, I see ANOTHER UPDATE! I'm like, "I wonder if it's gonna be different again?". I boot up the game. Same descent opening cinematic. But then it drops me back into the Sterling version of the game. WTF. All the goodness of the previous build...GONE. The snow field with the bus, fences and spiders back in full effect, only this time, the floors matched up,  there was a guy standing outside telling me how to cast spells and that I'd gain magic by running, which is good because I only got 24 bullets to use on the spiders that attacked me... But guess what...the spells did no damage and niether did the bullets. After some walking forward, a giant spider attacked and then the game just reset me to the title screen. WTF? ROFL!\n\n---After all this, I have to wonder to myself, did this "game" get put on steam because the games developer was a Valve employees autistic little cousin? "Is this "game" just a MASSIVE TROLL in disguise? Is this "game" a creation of a madman who restarts from scratch on every new build? Is this "game" social commentary on the state on Steams greenlight and Early Access? Is this "game" just a guy messing around with the Unreal 4 engine with no clear direction? I Reckon I have no idea, but I bet the next time I boot this game, it's gonna be yet again "A NEW RECKONING"","August 12, 2014","true","5.3"," 27 of 119 people (23%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","23","27","119","16","3"

Also, don't turn on your flashlight and run, as the light will bloom right off the gun model and into the camera, blinding you. And as for combat, well, I tried to kill some hoppy things with horns, but about 6 of them teleported in front of me right off the bat, and the 25 measly bullets I started with weren't enough to kill even one. Luckily for me, they took me from full to zero health in about two seconds, so it ended quick.\n\nAgain, it's an alpha, so I assume the less deirable features of the game will be ironed out at some point, but I almost wish it were simply optimized for smoothness and not changed in any other way. It would make for a hilarious stream.","August 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 6 of 66 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","6","66","2","4"

I really think this game is an abuse of the early access system so you can get some money to develop your game with absolutely no risk of it failing since there are no refunds leaving you to be able to drag your feet and make paid up consumers wait months on end with no end in sight. It's an abuse of an otherwise great idea and I urge that nobody buys this game or any other games the developer has in early access, at the very least until they are released in full.\n\nIt may sound a bit harsh and unforgiving, but everytime I see this in my games list, it serves as a grim reminder of how easily the early access system can be abused.","July 29, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 53 people (2%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","2","1","53","4","7"

If you're looking for a completely polished game then I'd say wait to purchase it but if you're like me & have fun finding the bugs, trying to break the boards, falling thru the floor, etc. then pick up the game.\n\nThe guys at Panzer are working hard on putting the game together with the help of us, the early players. Whenever I've submitted bugs they've been fixed and improved upon without having to wait a few weeks to sometimes months. That alone is a testament to the commitment these guys have made to make the game the best it can be.

With all the new titles coming out for consoles, Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain, COD: Advanced Warfare and Batman: Arkham Knight, this game is sure to beat all the latest upcoming titles.\n\nThere are a lot of great models for this game, including a Fire zombie, a normal zombie and even these incredible giant bugs that seem to of been brought to life from the film jumanji. This has a lot of great influences from such great games as left 4 dead and the zombie mode from Call of Duty which the developers have made their own in their "Horde Mode".\n\nThe graphics for this game is incredible! It's clear that this game is using Unreal Engine 4 because my computer starts to slowdown when there is a lot of fire and a lot of zombie models are on the screen. (Running a GTX 670 & I5 2500K)\nIt's clear that a lot of thought went into the design process and every detail of the games models have been thought of by the pixel and it shows.\n\nThis game plays very well. It has a gradual learning curve that gets steeper. it's easy to be good at the game but very hard to be amazing at the game. Much like CounterStrike Source or Global offensive, the gunplay isn't point and shoot. There is a great recoil to the game that makes gunplay much more fun and adds another layer of difficulty to the game.\n\nOverall this game is easily one of, if not THE best, Early Access Game I have played.\nI Highly Recommend This game.","July 15, 2014","true","5.9"," 16 of 104 people (15%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","15","16","104","6","10"

The game in question in A New Reckoning by a company called Panzer Gaming Studios.\nThe game itself is about….well I don’t know cause it does not have a story as of yet, nor any named characters for that matter making it hard for me to find something to talk about in the way of story and characters (obviously).\n\nSo what I'm going to do is talk about the POTENTIAL the game has, and some thing's I can see improvements in. For that I took a closer look at the developers behind the game, Panzer Gaming Studios. And there was not much to tell at all, what I did find out was that the game was a kick starter project and not much else.\nThe game itself is as I sad so far without a story to it so I can't tell you what it is about, alien invasion some kind of virus, or maybe just some dude at a Justin Bieber concert, that would explain all the hell demons on earth and why you wake up in prison.  Who knows at this stage, what I can tell you though, is that it is moving forward as far as developing is concerned. When I first got into the game you started in the great outdoors. There appeared to be zombies roaming around (or skateboarding as their legs weren't always moving) some plant monsters and the occasional bug monster. And you had a flashlight…..yes that was it. You where supposed to hold a gun I was sure because of the way one held one’s hands. But no gun was visible and no ammo either. Best I could do was to run around yelling "bang bang" in the hopes all my enemies would be very dodgy on the heart. The game was totally broken, my enemies and I would continually fall through the world as the ground broke, waterfalls that ended in nowhere and lakes that were just as hard as the rock around them.\nSince then however it has developed to at least four levels (at the time of writing) maybe more but that’s as far as I could go, less skating zombies, a new enemy type and 3 different weapons and ammo. It's come a long way, and I hope it will continue down this road. But I also see a lot if disinformation around this game. But more about this later, let's start with the game.\nWhen you start the game you break out from your cell by bashing a zombies head in during a very simple cut scene. Still I liked that it was there. I don’t know if this is the real beginning of the game, but for now, this is what it is. You then get to make your through an almost maze like surroundings as you try to find your way out. You will encounter zombies, and in many cases a lot of them in 3 different forms, as well as a new demon enemy that I really like so far. Even though the animation for it is not yet complete I still think that it is a nice one and it brings the game from the common "zombie genre" to something else, maybe a demon invasion, or hell rift at some place. I don’t know the story of the game yet. But the demon is a nice addition to the game at this point.\nAmong these enemies are a few bug ones as well, imagine an overgrown face-hugger from Aliens that mated with an ant or a mosquito without wings. I like them (except in level two, but I will leave the "why" up to you to find out) they need a bit of work though, especially the big one that serves as a boss in level one as it gets stuck in one place for most of the time, which obviously makes it really easy to kill. In the outdoor levels you also encounter a plant monster that too looked kind of cool. It does not move right but it should be nice when the game is ready for its release.\nOther than that, there are, as of now 3 weapons in the game as well; a normal assault rifle not a bad one but aiming down sights can sometimes cause the bullets to fly off in random directions; a shotgun that is all but good - The first shot from it will look like you shot a big flare and nothing else, It’s a big boom that only serves to blind the shooter himself and the second shot simply goes off with a poof to compensate for the solar flare it just threw in your face. My favourite of the 3 is the crossbow. Now the only way to make one of those better is explosive arrows, and what do you know...it has! Not only that, it also has some glowing mystical stuff that explodes. Not sure what it is, but it definitely explodes when it hits enemies and that’s half the battle right, making stuff explode.\nThe levels themselves are so far very simple as far as walls, floors and ceilings go, but they do get better when you get outside. I just wish there were more levels outside as I found them more enjoyable to play (and I did not get lost either). They don’t have much in the way of decorations either, with just a few pipes and wot-nots, as well as a few corpses here and there, but it's not more than that. Still, it’s an alpha and I do see a lot of improvements from its earlier stages.\nNow there is not much else to the game at this point, but I did want to talk about some of the disinformation about the game. First off, the rumour that the game has been cancelled...nope, it was merely renamed as the developers went over to a new engine, now working in the UE4 engine instead of UDK. So the game is still up and running.\nSecondly there were people that thought themselves tricked as the game they bought into was nothing at all like the trailer that was shown on the games Steam page in the store. I can understand this in some ways but on the other hand people should have figured as the trailer was from the supposedly finished game, and not the alpha build we have now. I too was a bit "What the f**k is This?" and still, I knew it was an alpha game. As I said though they are moving forward with the game in the right direction and I’d also like to say that many of the things people complain about is mainly of what they believe is false advertisement of the game to come. For example there is a picture of what looks like a huge scorpion on the developer’s Facebook page that I so far have not seen in any of my game plays. I sympathize with the developers though, because it takes times to make a game, however, maybe one should be careful about what one posts and how one does it. Why not label it work in progress, and people will not have to feel fooled or tricked that they did not find it in the game.\nMy final words for now about ‘A New Reckoning’, is that it has potential, and I would love to play the final product. And I really hope the developers keep working on this. Even though it's not there today I believe it will be in the future, I just hope it won't be too far in the future.  I will come back to this title at a later stage when it’s closer to release, but until then, happy gaming people.\n\n- By Kim Gustafsson","July 15, 2014","true","3.7"," 5 of 76 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","5","76","0","6"

I don't know what the big deal is. The game is in early access. These developers are using the money for funding. There is a clear warning on the store page what the shape of the game is in.\n\nNow I am amazed at how well the developers handled Jim Sterlings video's and counter acted on both with his own. I thought it was great, and it really shows especially yesterdays update that this guy or guys or girls or who ever means business. I wasn't to sure at first a few days ago, but with that new update am hooked. I don't care what anyone else thinks you guys have my support. I am recommending this game when I go to ID Tech camp next week which is a bunch of gamers.\n\nNow let me tell you what I really love. You never know what to expect each time you play this game, and am not saying this in a bad way at all. But one day it could look the same and play the same and the next day BAM major improvement. Honestly from now till the game is out am willing to bet its going to be a whole new game more than a few times around the block until the game is fully finished and released.\n\nHIGHLY recommend this game.","July 10, 2014","true","0.2"," 8 of 86 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","8","86","0","8"
