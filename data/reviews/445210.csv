Okay, so.. I like this game. The art style is quite attractive. It looks cell shaded in part. It looks something like a mobile game, but it functions pretty well with a mouse and keyboard. Thus far the music fits the setting. It is a casual, but not fully so. I am actually finding myself having a good deal of difficulty on some of the platforming. It's a mixture of mercy and classic save system. The levels are linear, and you get 3 lives by default per level. If you die, you get thrown back to an earlier spot, but only a little. However, once your lives are up, you go back to the beginning of the level, but not the entire game. This is not a very deep game, at least not so far, but it's enjoyable for anyone who wants a moderate challenge, and probably good your children. It's a very friendly game in art direction. I have some minor misgivings. Tiny Knight does not start you off with a sword and shield. on the third level, I am granted a shield and no sword. This would not be so bad if the platforming was a bit more lenient in introducing the game to new players. As I said, keyboard and mouse work pretty well, but I was not able to get my Xbox One controller to work with it. It might work with a 360 controller or by using the 360 controller emulator. I did not realize at the time I requested a review copy some obligations would emerge in my RL when they did. However, from the first three levels, I CAN recommend this game if you like colorful anime, specifically "cute" anime artwork, commonly referred to as "Chibi." It reminded me of my youth... Oh those days, Record of the Lodoss War! I have a severely autistic sister, she can communicate but not well, however, I had her sit down with me during my brief playtime and she liked it. Many years ago, my other sister and I would play Wind Waker and have Lilo (my autistic sister's nickname) watch. She didn't care to play much, but I think she has a fond memory of it and thus likes any game which features the Chibi anime style. I like Tiny Knight, and it's likely a nice gift for a youngish daughter, son, cousin, etc. It shouldn't require heavy hardware for that matter. I would like Convex Games to add native Xbox One controller support. Maybe have a wooden sword in the first level to tied me over? This is user-friendly enough for anyone to play.\n\nGraphics - Excellent and Fun\nMusic - Nice and Fitting\nGameplay - slightly bland for me, BUT it is still good and accomplishes what it sets out to do.\n\n7.5/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBeVKAXyiA0\nWatch live at http://www.twitch.tv/benyohanan","March 17","true","1.4"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","26","44","3","2"

Be warned, some of the puzzles are just praying to RNJesus and then the "jump puzzles" are sheer dumb luck in some places as no shadows and even the slightest mistouch and you slide off to your doom. Also, there is a level where you have to jump across moving platforms to an archer. He can shoot you as you are landing  and have it slide you off the platform thus taking 2 out of your 3 hearts in damage (there is fall damage if high enough). If you don't mind restarting levels because of varying bugs occassionally screwing things up and can see past those then you can enjoy this game. Graphics are ok, music is nice, and the whole mario kill effect can be fun as well as the enemies friendly fire.\n\nUpdate: devs quickly fixed the big issue that I marked as a no so it's now a yes.","March 19","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Some of the art is what you may expect -- you will encounter skeletons and dungeons. The animations are smooth, the game is balanced, and especially so if you choose the Hardcore mode - if you want a challenge, then I suggest you go Hardcore mode.\n\nThe challenge is what I'd say is just right -- it won't pain you for hours like Dark Souls does, but it isn't a walk in the park either. You regularly encounter new enemies you need to learn how to counter, and the boss fights are engaging and challenging.\n\nThe learning curve is great. You're given the bare minimums to start with, and at no point in the game do you feel pressured to memorize certain mechanics. It all comes streamlined and smoothly.\n\nThe only real quirk I have with this game was at one point the camera clipped into the terrain -- but just once.\n\nIf you like challenging slashing games, you're gonna like this game.","March 25","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Controls are great and still need to try it with my Xbox360 controller. I have not made far at the game, has you can see at my gameplay time haha. But this games has one issue. It seems the game is always at High at settings and when I change it to Medium or Low at launcher and in game, the game is still set as High. I know it just not my laptop, I have the same issue at my PC. And my laptop isn't that strong and can't most the time handle big games and sometimes games like this. It would be great to fix this issue so I can play the game smooth and not have alot of frame drops.","May 14","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world is very colorful but somewhat generic (lots of classic fantasy enemies like skeletons). Unfortunately I had my problems with the camera which will go through walls from time to time.\nYou start the game with your bare hands but will get more equipment (sword, shield and more) as you progress in the game. The gameplay itself is pretty simple with block/jump/attack actions and small puzzles in most levels which can be solved without much hassle for grown ups. I see this game as a perfect fit for the younger audience who is not that experienced in video games. If you have kids this can be a good introduction to gaming! ;)","March 18","true","0.4"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

Sometimes there are 8 or 12 in a row, miss one, you die or run the long way around and start over.\n\nMade it to level 10 before I rage quit.\n\nPros:\n* graphics are fun and cartoony, nice to look at\n* music is appropriate and lends nice atmosphere\n* works well with Steam Controller\n* fair/balanced amount of save points in most parts of the game\n\nCons:\n* non-stop challenge jumps and falling to your death is frustration gallore!\n* camera is horrible, constantly going behind walls so you can't see the playing field\n* VERY few puzzles\n* expected farther "view distance" from a game made with Unity, the draw-in is very very distracting\n* new swords just appear between levels with no explanation; you don't earn a sword at the end of a level or for defeating a boss, you just have a new sword for no reason when a new level starts\n\nTypical game play:\n* jump to a floating platform, jump to a floating platform, jump to a floating platform, fall to my death\n* jump to a floating platform, jump to a floating platform, fall to my death\n* jump to a floating platform, jump to a floating platform, jump to a floating platform, get shot by a skeleton, fall to my death\n* jump to a floating platform, jump to a floating platform, fall to my death\n*finally make it to the 12th platform, grab the gem, get killed by a shooting orb creature, die\n* jump to a floating platform, jump to a floating platform, fall to my death\n--Oh for the love of Bill! {RAGE QUIT!}","May 29","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
