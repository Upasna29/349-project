This one started out ok, but turned into a disappointment way too quick.\n\nWhat I simply don't like in this one is the difficulty curve, or should I say the steep changes in enemy arsenal and numbers. First you're up against like six enemies equipped with machetes and revolvers. Next sector you're up against 20 guys with assault rifles and grenades. I mean... WHAT?! In the old JA games, there were never such differences between neighboring areas, save for late-game ones.\n\nThen there's the issue with very micromanage-y combat, hard to read environments (sometimes a branch of a tree blocks vision, other times a man-sized ventilation shaft offers zero protection) and clunky interface that by default assumes you want to keep queueing new actions to happen after old ones are complete, unless you manually clear old orders first. Every. Single. Time. Guns also can't be fired in melee range, apparently, and melee hits register still after the target is ten meters away.\n\nLots of potential, but poor execution and lack of steady progression killed the fun for me way too quick. Can't recommend. Shame.","December 30, 2013","false","10.2"," 87 of 112 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","87","112","0","0"

My taste in PC games mostly includes the strategy (especially turn based and pausable RTS) genre. I'm a fan of the X-Com Games, The Total War Series, Close Combat, etc. I played all of the Jagged Alliance Games and enjoyed them all. In my opinion, JABIA is a good game if you like this type of game; a game that requires a lot of management (inventory, strategy, assembling teams, et.). I found the planning and execution of my plans in this game a lot of fun. There are a few rough edges. They could have included a way to look at items ordered after you ordered them, as in the old JA Games. As it is now, you place the order and you have to remember what you ordered until it arrives and the only place it can arrive is at the Drassen Airport, requiring a lot of 'mule' trips by your mercs who will spend much of their time running back and forth for supplies and using newly hired mercs as mules when they come in. The end result of this is that I found myself spending much of my time organizing logistics for reenforcement and resupply. If, like me, you enjoy this in a game, then you won't mind it and may even have fun with it. If this kind of micro-management isn't to your taste, skip this game.\n\nThe other part of the game is the tactical combat. This is done using a real time pausable system that requires many pauses and movement order updates during combat to be succesful (survive). With a small group of mercs (one or two teams of 6 each) it can be very exciting and great fun, but as the game goes on, and especially when you are getting ready for the final assaults on the enemy strongholds, you will probably have several dozen mercs going against hundreds of bad guys in just a few sectors. At this point the tactical combat becomes overwhelming as it is virtually impossible to be everywhere at once and are therefore forced to send a small group of mercs at a time against many enemies to whittle them down slowly, and it becomes a drawn out meat grinder of attrition. Not much sneaking around, tactical planning here. Just a whole bunch of shooting against very long odds. I think JA2 did much better by forcing the player, VIA limited finances and merc contracts, to run fewer teams and keep the game managable, while not requiring quite so many mercs to succesfully complete the game.  When you hire mercs in BIA, you pay the fee up front and they are yours for the whole campaign regardless of the length of time they work for you, and the money you find and earn in this game will easily run into the hundreds of thousands, so there is a balance issue here. Also, militia are pretty innafective, and when they die the weapons you equip them with dissapear. I found it much more effective, once you've been in the game for awhile to just leave teams of mercs within striking distance of primary towns and mines that you have captured and send them in when enemies try to attack. Mercs can move amazingly fast along roads and, as mentioned before, you'll have the money and therefore can afford the extra mercs to do the job.\n\nSome things I really like about this game:\n\n-Friendly fire is a threat. This adds some realism that I welcome, especially with grenades and explosives. You don't have the automatic grenade placement of the new Xcom. "Watch out for that tree branch...Hit the dirt!"\n\n-The strategic logistical and organizational planning and the tactical planning for each sector. A lot of fun here if you like that sort of thing.\n\n-The great fun of fast moving firefights once you get used to the interface, especially when the skirmishes are small.\n\nThere are some annoying bugs and design flaws, a few of which are:\n\n-In close combat you can't shoot at an enemy when he gets close to you. You'll hear comments like "Can't make the shot" and your merc will just stand there as the enemy soldier cuts you to pieces, even if you have a pistol or SMG.\n\n-Unlike the other good games in this series, you can't repair any equipment but weapons. Body armor just takes damage until it's useless, and it is very expensive.\n\n-Sometimes when told to fire repeatedly at one target, your mercs will cycle through the count-down time for aiming, then cycle through again without firing. They seem to be able to do this indefinately so you have to watch them carefully.\n\n-When in a firefight, mercs are often forced into a kneeling position (frequently exposing themselves to enemy fire) when doing certain tasks, like first aid, clearing a weapon or disarming a mine. This also happens when you try to arm a LAW (Light Anti-tank Weapon). This unfortunate glitch will get you hit fast!\n\n-Game stops working occasionally for no apperent reason ('JABIA has stopped working'). This doesn't happen often, but just when you are about to win an intense twenty minute firefight, it's a bit annoying.\n\nNOTE: There is a very good mod that helps this game quite a bit called the "Realistic Rebalancing Mod for Jagged Alliance - back in Action" by KILLATOMATE. I highly recommend using this mod to help some balancing issues and decrease the frequency of some glitches within the game.\n\nAs it is, I find this to be a very good game that has a lot of replayability. It's interesting to start off with various combinations of mercs to build different teams, then progress theough the game by taking areas of the map over in different order, etc. If they had taken a little more time and care in the development of this game, it could have been great.","January 17, 2015","true","302.2"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","44","49","5","3"

Another thing is, that you can't repair your body armor like in the previous titles (not sure if they fixed this). Also inventory management is clunky. The "story" is also a rip off, of the old titles or pretty much a one to one copy, nothing new here, no imagination.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but I just cannot.\nIf its on sale for cheap you can give it a try, but its not worth more than 8€.","November 25, 2013","false","29.5"," 93 of 130 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","93","130","0","0"

The pause/realtime system was indeed a break & a daring experiement for the franchise, but I think it works.  I'm not one of those "turn based purists" who think anything else is blasphemy.  I'm fine with it, actually.\n\nThe characters are familiar, and most of returning player expectations are met in that it delivers what it says on the book - a reboot of JA2 into a new game engine.  The same systems are all in play, and that's a good thing.  It's got your sector-by-sector conquer and consolidate, your cheesy dialogs and plenty of gun-fetish to go around.\n\nBut it also falls flat in some areas.  Any real firearms enthusiast can find a hundred different flaws, errors and downright screw-ups in that equipment list.  The AI, both friendly and enemy, is questionable at best.  A lot of the light humor from JA2 has either turned dark or disappeared.  With the helicopter removed, supply logisitics are simply nightmarish, now.  Most offensive of all, Elliot is gone.\n\nHowever, all that being said... when I look at this game and compare it to all the increasingly horrible crap out there that tries to leech JAs name whilst simulataneously grinding that name into the mud... I find myself compelled to defend the easily superior quality of this product on general principle.\n\nThe combat is still solid (usually), the tactics still interesting, the new problems that each town presents still challenging, and overall... yes, it's still fun.  Far from perfect, but fun.\n\nIn short, it is not the best JA game out there, but at least I can say is really is a proper JA game and not some crappy knock-off and/or wannabe junk.  It may just be JA2's ugly brother, but it's still family.  That's more than I can say for the rest of the garbage out there.","July 20, 2015","true","165.0"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","34","36","3","0"

I install it, play it for a while, and every time I have to uninstall it because I'm so immensely frustrated at the shoddy mechanics. The camera is fine for everything but actually seeing what you're doing, and you need to point and click where you want characters to go based on the camera's view. Point and click, mind you, on any pixel in a large map with thousands of tiny variations in elevation which can mean the difference between spotting and shooting and enemy or being blinded by the tip of a mintue hill. You CONSTANTLY have to deal with adjusting your position so you're behind cover but still able to see and shoot the AI, who by the way, do not have to deal with ANY of what I've complained about so far.\n\nThere are so many other small things I could complain about, but the above is what's making me vow to never play this again. Who would have thought a grid system would be make or break for this kind of game.\n\nOn the plus side, I really like the idea of a plan and go tactics game.","February 15, 2014","false","67.6"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","44","55","0","3"

The MAC/Linux version is unplayable at this point.\n\nI am a fan of JA2 and i was quite disappointed when JABIA was released. It was unfinished and overpriced on release. But things have changed. Most of the game's problems can be fixed by using mods and the price of the game has decreased considerably. I played the modded Windows version for 220 hours and really enjoyed it. I can only recommend this game.\n\nThe story/scheme of the game is very similar to JA2: You are hired to liberate a small 3rd world country and can only afford to send in a few wannabe mercenaries. You start to liberate/loot remote locations in order to get your hands on more money and better weapons while you recruit NPCs and improve their skills.\n\nIn contrast to JA2 this game is in 3D and in real time. Which is awesome in my opinion. You dont have to watch 40 AI moves until it is your turn. You can pause and intervene at any time. The game offers a lot of freedom. You can run away from tough battles and come back later with better equipment. You can even leave the first battle of the game and explore instead.\n\nThere are a few flaws, however:\n-Mercs have less character compared to JA2 and there is no option to create your own mercenary.\n-AI is just as stupid as in JA2 and attack squads are very predictable\n-Animations in this game feel like placeholders (all weapons have same reload animation and sound)\n-Annoying melee combat. Guns cannot be fired at melee range and melee hits damage all of your gear.\n-Explosives (C4) can only be placed on brittle walls. you cannot set traps for enemies.\n-You will spend a lot of time managing your inventory\n-Militia is not very useful and recruiting is tedious.\n-You cannot train/repair/heal on the strategical map (which was a nice feature in JA2)\n-Enemies cheat / have superhuman skill (fixed by mod)\n-Weapons are imbalanced and have wierd stats (fixed by mod)\n-Broken Stealth: enemies hear you walk/climb from up to 150m (fixed by mod)\n-Broken Camouflage: camouflage not working properly, especially at night (fixed by mod)\nPeople also complain about horrible aimtime in CQC, but this can be solved by using the Run stance (F3) at close range. This will result in rapid-fire instead of aimed-fire.\n\nSome reviewers claim that combat gameplay is "micromanagy" and "tedious". In my opinion combat is very simple and entertaining as long as you avoid common mistakes and use hotkeys. It is even possible to play the game completely in real time without any pausing as long as you know what you are doing.\nWatch the following gameplay videos and decide for yourself:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPUG-1YX80w\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbSYfYrhP9o\n\nMODS\nMods are very important to make this game more enjoyable. They are free and very easy to install. Mods fix most of the bugs, improve gameplay, improve balance, weapon progression, tweak AI, improve textures/sounds and add new weapons and ammo types. If you are interested in bugfixes, improved gameplay and new content, check out this mod:\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/realistic-rebalancing-mod\nIt took 530 hours to create this mod and the amount of fixes and improvements is considerable.\nMore mods can be found here:\nhttp://www.moddb.com/games/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/mods\n\nHowever, a few problems cannot be fixed by mods and remain:\n-performance issues in some locations\n-equipping militia is a tedious task\n-animations glitch from time to time (ladder/repair/heal)\n-sometimes enemies are able to shoot through their own cover\n\nConclusion:\nIf you can live with the problems mentioned above you should consider buying this game. $10 is not much for potentially 100 hours of entertainment, is it? ;)\n\nMy rating:\nOriginal release: 5/10\nPatched game: 6/10\nModded game: 8/10\n","June 11, 2014","true","869.0"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","37","44","0","0"

By "abused" I mean that pretty much every release with the name JA slapped on it was a huge disappointment when compared to JA2 (on which I spent so many hours, I could've built a spaceship using only a spoon in that time).\n\nAnyway, let's talk about BIA.\nBIA is quite an awkward game. On one hand it's a fresh approach to the genre and the title, on the other hand it sometimes makes you want to pistol-whip the living daylights out of the developers.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE MODDED VERSION (using either Combat Evolved or the Realistic Rebalancing Mod). The vanilla game will disappoint you. Plain and simple.\nThe combat system. The combat system is in real-time, yet it can be paused at any moment, and orders can be queued to your soldiers. It's awkwardly good - it needs a lot of getting used to, but once you get a hang of it, you can use it to your advantage and it's fun. Still, sometimes combat gets confusing, mainly when you're attacking using multiple teams.\nThe graphics. They're alright. They do the trick. Camera angles may get weird sometimes, but usually they're ok.\nSounds. Pretty much the same as the graphics. The voiceover isn't great, but it's not a deal-breaker.\nGameplay. It can get challenging, you'll get lots of gameplay hours out of it. The UI is ok, I've seen worse. Stability is ok, although the game has some tendencies to crash on you. What disappointed me a little was the lack of the lovely JA2 humour, with the Deidranna cutscenes missing altogether and other details not incorporated at all (like the florist website and many other things). BIA tries to take a more serious approach and fails, since humour was a big part of what made JA2 so much fun.\nThe AI is a mixed bag, one fight they'll just run towards you and get mowed down, a few moments later they'll use cover and cause some serious trouble.I played BIA using both of the aforementioned mods (in two separate gameplays, of course) and it was fun. They fixed a lot of issues, brought in tons of new guns and modifications, Combat Evolved also gave you access to a lot of old friends from JA2.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game?\nYes, as long as you mod it. You miss out on a lot playing the vanilla game.\nThe modded version gives you a touch of good ol' Sir Tech JA2, so if you're a long-time fan, don't even bother playing BIA straight out of the box.\nOf all the other JA clones or "remakes" out there, this is probably the best one.","February 9, 2015","true","209.0"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","32","39","3","6"

It looks really good, the locations are very detailed and allow us to engage combat in different ways. The combat system itself was changed from the original one. Fights run in real time but the player has an active pause option which can be used to give order to your mercaneries. There's also plenty of equipment and weapons to use. Whats also a pros is the fact that the game is sometimes funny. Some items descriptions can put a smile on you face.\n\nUnfortunately, in some aspects game was simplified against the original JA2. After passing a week in ingame time I was sure that I would have to prolong the contracst with hired mercaneries ( as it had to be done in the original game). Surprisingly you dont have to do it anymore. Player needs to pay the mercanery once and doesnt have to worry about prolonging contracst ( Despite the fact that ingame mercanery company statute describes the detailes of prolonging the contracts! ). This is a terrible solution which makes the game far too easy. In origninal JA2 money was a major problem and you had to think a lot how to hire new meraneries and have enough money to prolong the contracts. This made the game a real challange. Right now its just a casual, easy to play production. All because of this silly decision, which for me makes the game unplayable. The simplification is also visiable in the aspecst of characters development. Original system was uniqe and iteresting, you could train your mercs in different ways. Now you only spends random points after reaching the next level... Also new the militia traning system is silly and far worse then the one used before.\n\nTo sum up, Im dissapointed and I can't reccomend this game to die hard fans of old Jagged Alliance games. Although this production could be interesting to players new to the series who dont like too chalenging games.","July 9, 2014","false","14.7"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","31","40","0","0"

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. IF you're expecting some sort of revolutionary (or evolutionary) successor in the JA franchise, you're going to be disappointed. Back In Action is not that -- it's a re-envisioned, updated version of Jagged Alliance 2, with the ultimate aim of liberating Arulco from Deidrianna. Graphics are now 3D, and the game engine is "real-time" but combat can be paused for you to issue orders/commands. The nice thing about this system is that you can simultaneously coordinate attacks from different entry points, create overlapping fields of fire, ambush enemies stealthily with a knife, etc.\n\nSome things have been simplified too: you only pay for your merc once. Militia recruitment is simplified (all you need is to arm them). And you cannot create your own character (this was fun in the original JA2, but I'm not convinced absolutely essential).\n\nThe game focuses mainly on combat. In JA2 it was turn based, here, it's real-time with pausing enabled. Sight lines and physics seem ok. Can things go wrong? Of course. Just as they do in real life. So pay no mind to those who expect their tactics and plans to be executed perfectly. But that's part of the realism, and to me, the appeal of this JA title.\n\nSome things I didn't like: no helo transport (am going everywhere on foot, which is a pain) thus far, no ETA for my online orders at Drassen, no crafting of special items, inability to repair anything except weapons (though this can be thought of as realism I guess -- how can your merc repair everything from guns to knives to armor? Seriously?).\n\nStill I paid $11 for this title when on sale, got 2 extra DLC mission packs, and some mediocre firearms in some other packs. Based on that, I'm going to recommend this game.

Managing inventory, amor, militia and your mercs should be a pleasant change of pace between combat, but running around buying a gun and then figuring out which door you need to open so that you can give it to a militiaman is more trouble than it's worth.\n\nThe little cutscenes from JA2 - corny as they were - also appear to be missing, so the game feels almost bereft of plot or character.\n\nAfter a couple of dozen hours, I've liberated just under half of Arulco, but I feel like I've already experienced everything the game has to offer.","March 13, 2014","false","27.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

I like the pause-and-go of the UFO series for example. The most enjoyable feature for me is squad management - assigning roles and weapons, planning an approach and then executing the plan. Seeing your mercs storm a building from two sides and take down the hostiles inside in a perfectly coordinated assault is incredibly satisfying. JA:BiA does squad management really well - not as fluid and rewarding as the latest XCOM, but with all of the detailed management of equipment that the latter left out.\n\nI'm a bit annoyed by the repetition though (clearing the same area over and over again), but in general this game is very enjoyable.","October 31, 2014","true","24.9"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

It had the potential to be a worthy successor to the excellent JA1 and JA2 games of our youth. Nice graphics, a decent combat system. Unfortunately, it seems they never really got round to finishing the game. It's like they cut a load of corners, spent too much time designing junk items (like a wide variety of t-shirts and food items), didn't properly test it, rushed it to market and then started on the DLC cashgrab as soon as they could.\n\nA few gripes and missing features :\n\nThere's several really annoying bugs (for example, items in sector inventory will disappear randomly and only reappear if you save and reload). Gameplay is unbalanced - expect to face off against skilled, well-armed enemies with your two or three pistol-wielding mercs pretty early on. If you move into an occupied sector, expect to be dumped right next to the enemy forces - you need to move next to the danger area and manually enter the zone if you want to try any kind of stealthy approach.\n\nThere are cars and lorries all over the landscape but none of them are usable. Forget about quick transport between locations.\n\nExplosives can only be used at specific weak points in walls so forget about making your own entrance to a building. You'll often find locks that can't be picked or forced. You can't shoot locks or blow up doors.\n\nMercs and militia will happily jump on landmines, even when they've been detected. There's no autopause when a mine is detected, either, so if you're sending a merc through a potentially mined area, do so carefully.\n\nThe militia system has been horribly simplified. Rather than go through the tedium of vetting recruits and teaching them to use guns, why not just hand that random person on the street, potentially violent prisoner in a locked cell or hospital patient found in a locked ward an assault rifle? What could possibly go wrong?\n\nOnly one weapon attachment is allowed at a time and is removed if you change weapons. Want a silencer, laser sight and fancy optics on that gun? Forget it. Want to switch to another gun when your inventory is full? Drop something first.\n\nShooting an enemy will interrupt and stun them (fine, that's a good idea) yet hitting them with a baseball bat or machete doesn't, allowing the enemy a chance to beat the snot out of your merc.\n\nIMP no longer exists. Forget about making your own merc.\n\nEnjoyed those witty interactions between mercs or those cutscenes of Deidranna abusing her staff in JA2? Interesting, well-written dialogue with NPCs? You won't find them here. By the time you're storming the palace you'll just want the game to be over and done with.\n\nConclusion : Meh. Don't bother.

There where so many small things which I dident  like and in some regards where worse than the original. First of is the thing I like the most which the original. The characters. They are like cheap imitations of the originals. The voice acting is not realy that good and where are the cool comments and the intriges between the diffrent characters. Where are M.E.R.C? >_< Then we have real time combat whicj is all fine except that the enemy AI is quite bad and the pause funtion only work when it feels like it. The most important thing is that you could sett it so you paused the game when a character is finish with its actions, which is important if you storm a city with 18 mercs. But this never worked for some reason. So I had to pause the game frequently to se that all was doing something. Then it is the tactical map. They try to show that if 2 armies meet that you zoom in on the map and the look on the map depends on where you was on the tactial map. But this is fake. They already was special sectors put on the map and you go ito the one you are in. Also the enemy that comes to attack the towns you have secured always tkes the same route  and attack the same towns. After a while I noticed this and only fortified that town. You can also "cheat" for ex. If you want to get away or intercept some enemy coming on the tactical map. You can just go into combt mode runt the the end of the screen and go back into the tactical map go for a short while so you come inte the next sector and then zoom in and do the same. This makes your trvel go much faster and you mercs do not get as tired. :D. Also if you are about to storm a fort and you think there are a bit to many enemies you can if you find a good spot do this. For ex. At one place I found that they had 2-3 guards at a gate a bit far from the others so I stod near it zoomd into combat mode killed them, zoom out and then zoomed in again and there where 3 more guards. I did this for a while and after some time they stoped to have guards there but then I had killed like 15 of 30 enemies in the area. ^^ Then we have that yo cant train militia which is fine but why must I go into combat mode and run to talk to them to give them weapons, why not just be able to do that on the tactical screen?. Many things are more simple like the medical stuff where you dont need to treat wounds extra on the tactical map. Lastly where are the humor. I loved the humor with the queen, Eliot, M.E.R.C and many more characters which is laking in this game. The orignal is one of my favorit game of all time and I dont think this lived up to it. :( But I liked playing it anyway.","March 31, 2014","false","80.9"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","27","39","0","0"

What could go wrong?\n\n\n=> Well, unfortunately, the devil lays in the detail.\n\nWhile the game itself might entertain quite a bit, there are so so many small issues, that they kinda sum up to leech the fun out of the game.\n\n* Controls: Are never thorougly explained, I had to look them up in the www as lots of key, that make the game easier to control, are never shown anywhere in the game. Even worse: you cannot change them!\n* Graphics is pretty ok in general. FPS sometimes go down in bigger cities, but not as much as it becomes unplayable. But unfotunately you cannot zoom out as much as you want, making snipering a game of scrolling around.\n* Mico-Management. Usually I like realistig micro management. But in this game you have to literally open every single item stack, remember which is which to change weapons etc. until you cleared an area (only then you can drop around freely - ONLY those you opened so far, however).\n* Music: Gets boring. Fast. Like really really fast: turned it off while still in the first area.\n* UI: Does not scale (or is just always tiny?), nor be resized. Also several, seemingly minor, but still annoying issues, like you cannot compare your currently equipped stuff while opening an item stack. You can only compare that to your carried equipment. What to compare weapon? Unequip first, put in carry slot, then open item stack again - reverse afterwards. Same goes for other stuff, like interchanging equipment between squad members.\nAlso several stuff is not displayed (like weapon accuracy), so if you're not a weapon enthusiast, it's often hard to decide which one is better.\n* AI: Just stupid. SOO stupid. Sometimes stays around while under fire. Sometimes turning around weirdly. Sometimes hits with a pistol my sniper several times although he is half a km away, and cannot hit him, although it says "very likely to hit". They vision cones are awfully small. But sometimes they spot you while crouching below a tree at night, from 100m afar.\n* Bugs - and this is really bad, as I played the game late, like >3 years after reloase, so I guess no bugfixes anymore:\n** Achievements came up pretty weird: First 2 areas were fine, then some appeared which I definetely did not trigger, while others appeared later or never. Like "Layed 100mines" came randomly after throwing a grenade. And BEFORE the "Layed first mine" one O.ô\n** Sometimes mines did not trigger at all\n** Or my guys just did not shoot. Gave the order, aim was fine, enemy did not spot them yet and stand still. Nothing. Only level reload sometimes helped.\n** Weird stuff like you cannot lay mines everywhere you want. Making them useless most of the time.\n** .....\n\nWell, would-be great game, if they'd spend more love on the details.\nWould-be.","September 3, 2015","false","19.2"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

Jagged Alliance 2, simply put, is the king of the small, but proud sub-genre of strategies, namely, a squad-based tactical wargames.\nJA Back in Action is the 3d re-vision of classical JA2, with new engine based on real-time action with commanding pause mode. To my regret, I wasn’t impressed with that cover-version, so I’m not gonna persuade you to buy it. Game’s decent, even engaging sometimes, but really not that much as original JA2. Even with the all downsides that original Jagged Alliance 2 have, it is still a much better game than its remake Back in Action.\n\nShort audition of features:\n\n1) 3d view works fine enough, but I can’t say same thing about control above the camera view. Due to real-time gaming pattern, I often was in the not-so-fun position where I can see neither enemies, nor my own soldiers in the middle of the shootout. Somebody’s shooting, but who? On whom? It was not obvious way too often. The biggest throw-down of the given 3D engine is not a bad camera, though. It is very limited destructibility. You have plenty of C4 there, but you only allowed blowing certain points at every sector. You can’t even open closed door with the shotgun!\n\n2) All controls are giving the feeling that developers were in need to invent a wheel anew. Or at least, a bicycle. Even moving a map from side to side with the sliding of mouse was added after some patches. And when you‘ll make yourself familiar with the basic controls, you’ll still be wandering with some “decisions” about user interface. Like management of your mercs in teams, or management of inventory of taken sectors.\n\n3) Smart pause mode itself is good, comparing only with the best examples in the genre. But crude AI behavior and sometimes ridiculous camera makes that modus not so desirable, so to say. It is still a good option, but not the essential, like in games on Apeiron engine (7.62, Marauder) or even in the Dragon Age titles.\n\n4) AI of the enemies… they shoot precisely, even with the weakest of weapons, but instead of taking the advantage of those superb skills, they always tend to rush forward, by the shortest path available. And they don’t give much attention to the dead bodies of their comrades, if they don’t heard a shot or seen the shooter. In short, they are quite dumb. There are several maps in the game, where some additional rules were added to enemies behavior, and it is there you’ll probably meet some troubles, and get an urge to plan something ahead. 3-4 serious fights in the whole game, I’d say it’s not enough, but that’s me. Someone likes easy games, and the majority of games now are making for those casual players. So take a hint: buy some PSG-1 rifles and collimators, to shoot far and precise enough, and quite fast at the same time. With those rifles you’ll be having the upper hand almost in every situation that game has for you.\n\nBy the way! The AI of guards you’re hiring for defending your sectors… it’s the same as with soldiers, but even worse! They don’t use any tactical advantages of the defending position; they just rush on the bullets! And, unlike the Jagged Alliance 2, you can’t just hire new guards via global map. You need to get some guns, go to the sector where the fight with Deidranna forces was, arm manually each new volunteer… And if he dies, he won’t leave his gun on the body, you need to find or buy a new one. So you need to participate in every fight by yourself, and it will be faster that way.\n\nI can keep up with that list, but that’s major things: the game went in 3D, but became much plainer in the process, if we compare it with the vanilla Jagged Alliance 2. Back In Action took almost everything that wasn’t so necessary and fun, like over-pompious music themes, and constant transitions of items between sectors. A 3D perspective is not bad to have, and smart pause mode can be tolerable. But illogical and un-informative camera views, clumsy controls and blunt behavior of any opponents are not giving the taste of satisfaction even when you prevail above them.\n\nTake me right, I’m not thinking that the Jagged Alliance is a perfect game, even if I’m calling it the king of the tactical genre. Were it up to me, I’d cut or remade some features from it as well, and all that constant fuss with the inventory items, which need to fix, optimize, transfer from sector to sector, from drop zone to battle lines – in the first hand. I’d add some really fitting and atmospheric music to the background, just to fight the urge to fell asleep over the keyboard, while I’m planning another phase of ongoing war conflict. And to think more of it… Maybe the most challenging thing that was made under the brand of Jagged Alliance was not that 2nd game we’re so much talking about? Maybe it is the add-on to the first Jagged Alliance, the Deadly Games? There you have a line of separated missions for your squad of mercs. You have one map, where you fixing all your tasks, and after it, that’s all, you’re victorious! It feels much more refined, than questionable economic system of the JA2 game.\n\nThe developers of Back In Action thought in that direction as well. They made two DLC with such maps, in every case you have some quest to get in somewhere and kill there somebody, via some sub-stages on the way. Sadly, but both of those DLC’s are just shown how amateur those developers are. There are different reasons for this conclusion, but hear this: in the mission Shades of Red you need to storm some embassy where hostages are being held. The developers make the several ways to get to that embassy, and the cleverest one was from the basement, which you can penetrate via sewerage tunnel. That way you don’t need to dodge the rockets, which the insurgents will be shooting in case of direct assault. But, but, but… In the end the devs decided it is not good for balance, so now you can’t get to embassy via tunnel. You see it from one end near the river, you can get there with a C4 blast through the wall. But you can’t go further to the tunnel. After you storm the embassy in the hardest, direct assault way, you get down to the basement, and then you see another end of that tunnel, and you realizing, how far Back In Action from the real complete state. Even now, after 3 years after release, with all after-market fixes, like adding the possibility to use mouse to move the map… it is still far from complete, not only in the DLC maps, but in the major game as well.\n\nFinally, so many words after, a conclusion: you CAN buy the Back In Action, if you have a thing for tactical games. It is not a bad game; it is playable and sometimes even brings some fun!\n\nI’ll mark it 6.5/10. It looks good, it sounds and feels almost like old-good Jagged Alliance. Simple-sized for newer, casual players (who can forgot to reload gun between getting into the fights, for example) – but still you controlling a team of mercs, and still you’re in the lead of private war going in the colorful little Latin country. You may find many mods, honing the improvements Back In Action made to Jagged Alliance franchise. There are not so many games in the genre, after all, and Back In Action is certainly not in the worst part of that list.","November 12, 2015","true","163.5"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","5"

Remember that you are a part of a STRUGGLING rebel group trying to overthrow a goverment, so expect it to be difficult to kill hundreds of soldiers with a couple squads of 6 or less mercs(though you can have multiple squads in the same location, you'll just have to tab between them). As a fan of strategy games, I can say that this game does have an unusually steep difficulty curve, but not an impossible one. You can expect to lose and replace squad members(unless you're a fan of copious saving and reloading), and you may have to retreat a few times, but with the right prep work a single mid-level merc can take out a squad of 15 without taking a hit. You MUST have a strategy in mind before moving in, and you must learn to be flexible. As the in-game time progresses, locations receive more and more reinforcements, so you must act quickly to secure a few early and get your daily income up to otherwise the entire game will be an uphill battle. Arming the locals is crucial, unless you leave some mercs behind to defend against the ai squads which is a good idea in a few locations.

However it does have its flaws. The game starts off awesome, with your 1 or 2 mercs tactically taking out bad guys, using stealth and flanking. It's great! But after capturing a few areas, the enemies quickly become OP, with machine guns and snipers, heavy armour and they can spot you from miles away. Flanking and stealth doesn't really work any more if you pump an entire clip into an enemy and they still don't die..... Plus, if you do manage to kill them, they drop crappy items! Maybe a couple of $$ and some crappy pistol ammo. Ummmm what happened to all the gear you were carrying Mr. Dead Bad Guy?\nBecause of this, I started a new game 3 times and lost motivation each time I reached that point in the game, never going any further because it wasn't much fun.\n\nHOWEVER! Using the Realistic Rebalancing Mod, it fixes all that and more! After getting this mod, I finally had fun and finished the game. My only flaw now would be the level design in some of the later levels isn't as good as the starting levels. A lot of big open spaces where long range weapons and high marksmanship stats are all that matter.\n\nI would definitely recommend JA Back in Action, as the first few levels will definitely get you hooked. And if you want to improve the game balance, just simply use the Realistic Rebalancing Mod.","May 23","true","131.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

In fact I would argue that, while flawed, this is one of the best tactical engines ever made. This game also feels like a "real Jagged alliance", and this comes from someone who played the originals when they were first released.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of JA fans who have their heads stuck on that is "has to be turn-based" in order to be a "real JA" whined like little girls about this wonderful engine being pausable real time. That earned the game a bad rep and it didn't sell well. Too bad because that meant we never got a proper sequel and a sequel to this game would have been amazing. The irony is that if it had not been a JA game it would have been hailed as one of the great tactical games ever, but instead we got narrow-minded whining and the developers gave up on the engine.\n\nIt's not perfect, there are flaws and annoying details, that's why my heart bleeds that we'll never see a proper sequel, but that does not change the fact that this is one of the most detailed and innovative hybrid tactical games ever.\nStill recommended today in 2015, the graphics are a bit dated now of course, but it's an intensely enjoyable game and there are some good mods to make it better (it's also really easy to adjust things yourself by editing text files).\n\nHighly recommended. At the time of this writing I have 530 hours sunk into this game.\nIf you like this kind of game, don't miss JABIA just because of whiney old-school fans who can't see beyond "turn based".","May 19, 2015","true","614.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Jagged Alliance 2 was known for it's turn-based strategy, degree of micromanagement that rewarded those with a shred finanical planning with a bigger margin of error, and memorable characters with very unique voices and facial graphics. Jagged Alliance 2 was a shining example from the old era of games, when PCs could only go so far on graphics and had to focus on the actual depth of the game. This is a facet that some Indie Companies are returning to. So now we come to the "remake" of Jagged Alliance 2, Jagged Alliance 2: Back in Action.\n\nI acquired this game by an Ebay sale, for $10, and still feel that I got ripped off. I have tried to play this game, wanting to love it cause of it's heritage, in which I spent long hours with Jagged Alliance 2. However, this so-called 'Innovative' Plan-N-Go function is not only a slap in the face to what was a main fun point of JA2, but is clunky in it's own execution. Plan-N-Go is not innovative. It isn't really 'Turn-Based'. All it is, is just Pausable Real-Time, with a very obtuse method of programming in moves. It creates a situation however where you have to pause constantly, as no planned tactics really go according to plan. Why the developers ignored the fans, who didn't want this development, I simply will not understand.\n\nThe characters are..bland. The facial graphics are horrid, the voice acting is just horrible, and how this new game can do WORSE in this area, from it's decade old original just outright boggles me.\n\nThe music is good. Very good, so good I wish I could extract the music files and then just delete the game and be done with it.\n\nGraphics? Yes, it has pretty graphics. Then again, so do all other games out now from big bucks studios. Pretty graphics is no longer a selling point, as many gamers are actually turning away from games that brag about graphics as they realize these games have just graphics..and nothing else. JA: BiA is a good example of this.\n\nThe DLC focus and the sudden expansion hint at the companies own realization that they released a stinker of a game with very limited shelf life. Their content release, with attached price-tags, show they aren't really proud of this game and are looking to just cash in as soon as possible before a better version is released.\n\nShould you buy this game? Only if the price drops below that of a 16 oz. Pepsi. But spend your money on the Pepsi instead, as you'll get more enjoyment out of it. Pirate this game. The developers don't deserve a single penny. Money should be given for good products, not handed over to people who push out a horrible product, and laugh when you expect some actual quality for your investment.\n\nI am hoping the developers of Jagged Alliance: Flashback look at this game, and see within it, a tale on what NOT to do.","August 14, 2014","false","0.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Far from it, yet, it is enjoyable nonetheless. Until someone makes a true sequel, this game is well worth it.\n\nThe graphics are good, except the mercenary pictures. they are "3D" and really ugly. Although you can spot some likenesses of the original mercs, these are really annoying to look at. They do change when equipping headgear though, so you can hide the face rather well with masks and helmets.\n\nNow the biggest disappointment for hardcore JA2 fans; The plan-and-go gameplay, which tries to merge RTS with Turn-based combat. As someone else said; prepare to do some micro-management. But I found the system to actually work surprisingly well. Ofcourse I prefer the true-turn-based combat of the original, yet this new hybrid thing isn't as bad as many would say. You can still plan ahead, set waypoints and execute excellent ambushes. The system is much deeper than you'd think. Just try it and you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe story is the same as in the original, as well as most of the quests. I netted 176 hours into this one and is well worth the money imho. The only major gripe is, for me, not being able to create your own merc. A huge oversight. But other than a few things getting used to, it really is an under-rated game. For someone like me who absolutely hates RTS games, I thoroughly enjoyed it and even started a new campaign after a year.\n\nIn short: I got my money's worth and recommend this game for anyone who likes to take combat at his/hers own pace.","January 8, 2014","true","178.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I really want to.\n\nIt is a shame that after Jagged Alliance 2 this franchise has been savaged at a pretty good clip.\n\nA continuation of the Jagged Alliance series that doesn't quite fit the bill. At times this game can be HIGHLY and EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING, as the bullet physics simply do not MAKE SENSE. I have had to replay scenario after scenario simply because my sniper who is equipped with a .50 cal barrett and a sniper scope is somehow unable to make a shot within 5 seconds that somehow bounces off an incoming enemy who is running towards my prone merc anticipating a shot.\n\nJagged Alliance 2 was an amazing game. The characters each had their personalities and idiosyncrasies. This game comes across as feeling flat as there is zero dialogue between mercs.\n\nThis game could have been so much more yet the devs failed on a variety of key points.\n\n\n1.) In this new series, your merc is UNABLE to repair armour. What does this mean? It means that you have to essentially shlep a merc back and forth, running orders for new armour. This translates into a huge waste of time and a waste of money. The game is seriously derailed because after a while you lose your armour and every single enemy AI you encounter has brand new armour. Lame.\n\n2.) The game is highly unbalanced and the devs are incompetent about this. It requires Ivan 6 seconds using a Barrett .50 cal with a scope to take a shot and all of his attributes are 90+ across the board. Yet it takes an enemy AI 2 seconds standing up to squeeze round after round and Ivan is dead before he gets a shot off. Idiotic.\n\n3.) It took me a record FIVE SHOTS from a PSG-1 50 feet away to drop an enemy AI. Each shot the enemy just shook it off. One shot alone with a 7.62 round 50 feet away to your head and your head would magically disappear into a fine mist. And yet the dev at BitComposer overlook this glaring fact.\n\n4.) Waiting patiently works against you. By the time I was ready and good to attack major cities, the number of enemy AI had bloated to over 80 a city. It took me around 3 hours of repeated saving and trying before I was able to take over the Docks which had 40 dead enemies. Ridiculous.\n\n5.) Enemy AI shooting mechanics are UNREALISTIC. I have had a merc prone some 50 feet away on an incline, which means he is facing the slope before having reached it. The other side the enemy AI has somehow managed to SHOOT ME THROUGH THE ♥♥♥♥ING HILL. Seriously...\n\n6.) Enemy AI will spot you miles down the road. Camouflage does not work. I have had snipers prone among trees and grass blended right in and the AI has been able to see me and also SHOOT ME THROUGH TREES AND ROCKS.\n\n7.) Camouflage counts for nothing.\n\n8.) The game forces you to heavily rely on micromanagement of cities with its system of hiring miltia. In Jagged Alliance 2 you could simply equip militia and watch a quick run through as they fount incoming troops. Whatever leftover troops were automatically leveled up. After a while, you could have a full compliment of militia and ANY town would be safe. In Back in Action, the computer will forever send 10 man teams to Cambria. Seeing that Cambria is an important city with its arms dealer, you are forced to park mercs to defend it.\n\n9.) Regular militia are essentially useless. There are no defensive capabilities with militia. You can equip them with the latest weapons and armour and they will simply walk out in the open and get mowed down. It will cost you 10s of thousands to continue equipping them with weapons.\n\n10.) There are no interrupts in this game like there were in Jagged Alliance 2 which is a shame, since you were rewarded for carefully planning your moves.\n\n11.) Even with the balancing mod, your mercs take far too long to shoot. While it makes sense to take longer to peer down a scope and shoot, trained mercs in real-life who use red-dot sites or holographic sights can shoot in under 2 seconds at a target. In this game you can be lying prone on the ground with a machine gun and it will take your merc 2-3 seconds to ready himself to shoot while the AI will mow you down.\n\nUnless you are willing to play a game that involves loading save after save hours on end, don't bother getting this. If you do get this, get the Realism Balanced mod which not only addresses the glaring gun flaws but adds new weapons. It makes the game playable.\n\nAll I want to ask the devs is, WTF kind of QA do you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ do at BitComposer?\n\nTake a look at the screenshot below.  Wolf is UNDER WATER hidden behind trees with roots blocking the view. And yet he is still spotted. W T F IS THIS B U L L S H I T\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WrxqmVn.jpg\n\nDo not buy this game unless you want to spend 90% of your time reloading save after save.\n\nWhat's german for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs who make broken games?","March 22, 2014","false","203.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially when on sale.\nI've completed about 70% of the main campaign + 2 DLC missions. I've got 10 mercs and playing on Hard the game still doesn't seem to be easy. Though I never bough any additional mercs (probably would have been too easy going with Scully and Gus and Magic), I'm doing ok with my first choice (Wolf) and the rest found along my journey. Iggy is pretty good as well. Dynamo, Conrad and Miguel almost maxed out. So... I'll keep on playing. :)\n\n\nI've played hundreds of hours with the original Jagged Alliance 2. I loved that game, and that was the main inspiration when I bought Jagged Alliance Back in Action. It is hard not to compare the two. I think we should rate this game on its own merit, not comparing it to it's "predecessor". I'll try to restrain myself from doing that. I'll try to make the "review" as if I never played Jagged Alliance 2.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely recommend this game. Here's why:\n- nice strategy elements\n- lots of guns\n- mercenaries from a wide range of characters\n- many different ways to play the game (sneak, melee, long range, spray'n'pray, explosives & traps :), etc)\n- for £7.5 sale price you get a complete game, 2 DLC missions and 1 extension pack with a new campaign. Just the extra content offers more than 24 hour game play. Definitely worth the money.\n- graphics is OK\n- sound is OK\n\nThere are a couple of downsides though:\n- original £25 might be a bit too expensive for the game.\n- sometimes it crashes (at least on my computer) therefore you have to save often. That pretty much solves the issue.\n- ALT + TAB can cause a crash as well (see previous point)\n- there is an exploit in the game that allows you to finish it in less than 24 hours game time (still you'll play days in real life though :)) When you move on the world map, it takes time. However moving in the tactical map (location map) time is frozen. So you go to the edge of the tactical map, switch to world map, go to the next location, and as soon as you enter, you stop the time and go to the new tactical map. All it takes in game time is 1-5 minutes. Otherwise it would take hours to travel from location to location.\n- sometime things don't make sense (e.g.: you can blow up a wall from one side but not from the other, or guns might get jammed while you melee someone with them. lol)\n- level cap is 10. It feels a bit low. I could do so much more...\n\nAll in all the game feels OK, if you like tactical games, you'll like this one as well. If you are very critical towards it and you try to compare it to JA2, then you'll be a bit disappointed (unable to create your own character, level cap, less guns (still quite a lot!), less tactical, less things to customize, etc.)","March 17, 2014","true","143.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am actually surprised it was released recently.\n\nI really wanted to like Jagged Alliance. I'm a huge fan of Fallout Brotherhood, and I just got off a XCom : Enemy Unknown kick. Jagged Alliance falls flat in it's ability to explain how to play. There's a tutorial, but it pushes into the world and makes you sink or swim. Even something as simple as shooting at a target is complicated. Why is defending a perimeter is hard? There are tactics-style games from 5 years ago that do it better than Jagged Alliance.\n\nI could not figure out how to play, and after a hour or two, I gave up. XCOM must have spoiled me. Jagged Alliance makes moving and shooting so frustrating that is ruined any chance for me picking it back up.","December 14, 2013","false","6.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Back in Action is the tragic reality of what happens when classic IP's go up for sale in a gaming industry were Call of Duty and Halo are the kind of titles that investors would rather commit to.\n\nBack in Action does not deserve to carry the name. And BitComposer has done the franchise a great injustice by allowing such a game to be made, and not to mention alienating the old fans by asking us for our input (via their forum in the infancy of the games development) and then doing the exact opposite of what the majority asked for.\n\nAnd when sales and reviews were terrible... they still insisted that Turn Based Games are dead... And then XCOM Enemy Unknown was released...\n\nIf you never played JA or you aren't to concerned with deep strategic gameplay mixed with a serious learning curb, then you might enjoy this. If you like a good TBS title, XCOM Enemy Unknown isn't without its faults, but is leagues above this poorly designed attempt at cashing in on a cult classic. Especially with the DLC's included (like Enemy Within).\n","January 3, 2014","false","13.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I think the developers just went too lazy and didn't finish the final product. The game basically works but it isn't polished enough and when the main stroy is borrowed from the JA2 the gameplay feels more or less boring. I waited something new and special and this just turned me off. Oh one more thing. The AI is just horrible.

Do not listen to anyone who says this game is anything other than a waste of cash.\nObligatory comment re: having played all the JA series, XCOM, Shadowrun Returns, Antisquad, et cetera. The JA reboot's problem is that after six hours' play, you can see the exact moment that the developers shrugged, said "meh, it's good enough" (or ran out of budget) and handed it over to the modding community to fix its many glaring problems.\nIt looks nice, but lacks the soul of the original. You'll find your local militia getting overwhelmed regardless of equipment. Many maps are simply too large for a small squad to beat, and the enemy forces are both vicious and highly mobile. There are any number of glaring line of sight and cover issues, and equipment degrades so fast you'd think you were swimming through acid. Overwatch fire is ineffective. The metagame of protecting your territory and hiring more teams or getting new equipment is just tacked-on rather than integrated into the overall experience.\nAll in all, and being a huge fan of small-unit tactics games, I'd say give this one a miss. If you never played JA2 you'll find this game frustrating because it's bad. If you did play JA2, you'll find yourself uninstalling this and going back to it because this is just so unfulfilling.","June 3, 2014","false","39.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

However... I was utterly disappointed. This "game" (if one can refer to it as that, since the word "game" implies fun and enjoyment, and you won't find any of that here!) performed poorly in every single aspect, be it gameplay, audio, visuals, or the TERRIBLE rehash of the original game's epic, almost titanic story. The complete lack of an option to create and customise your own merc is a VERY harsh blow to this title's already frail foundation, but the coup de grace is undoubtedly the horribly poor butchering of the pre-existing characters in the game. Not only have their voices (which were top-notch stuff in the original) been changed, but their personalities, skill-sets, and hell, even their appearances as well! Simply put, this "game" is best left to rot in the feces-strewn pile of horrible remakes throughout the history of games. A MUCH better choice would be to just buy the GOG.com version of the original (Jagged Alliance 2) instead, which - ironically - costs only one third of this atrociously poorly "made" (or shall I say...

By far, my biggest complaints are with the AI.\n\nYour soldiers are absolute morons and can't do anything without being micromanaged. Even when set to guard your Mercs often won't shoot at enemies within range and sight zone, you have to manually tell them "Hey kill that guys who's shooting your face." They see a mine? Better halt em or they'll run over it. This is super annoying when splitting a squad into smaller teams for flanking. Want them to go talk to someone? Better hope there's no closed doors in the way. They are incapable of opening them to get to somewhere on their own. Also ran into several issues with game freezes & crashes.\n\nFor a real time squad based game, which I tend to hate in comparison to turn based, it isn't too bad thanks to the ability to pause and issue commands. Though sadly, even that system has its flaws. Once your guys run out of shoot commands, they'll stop shooting. I often found myself just staying in real time or loading up with dozens of shoot commands to cut down on the micromanaging.","November 25, 2013","true","13.1"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","0"

You hire mercenaries and go in and shoot everything that moves and/or looks at you funny and try to liberate the country.\n\nSo the similiarities tend to end there, they are games of a different albeit similiar genre. I think the real time RTS is more fluid and certainly looks a lot more cinematic when you're in a dramatic realtime battle, but in its current format its fun, but i think the (sometimes tedious) Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 combat is far superior. Of course while this combat never gets tedious because its a lot faster and more fluid than the turn based system, i tend to find that this combat can be more frustrating. i tend to know why something happened in JA2, i ran out of bullets and was reloaded and he put a shotgun shell through my gut, well okay fair enough. But in Back in Action i've done things such as kicked open a door, ambushing a machine gun wielding bad guy from behind, with three soldiers with SMGs and shotguns at close range, in the hip fire stance, he turned around from his crouch and gunned them all down in a matter of moments before they could even fire.\n\nHowever its still fun, its still worth playing especially if you get it on sale, the original price might be a bit steep.\n\n8/10 - rated slightly higher than i would have just because its such a good setting and genre and they dont make enough of these in modern gaming","December 3, 2013","true","45.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

The combat system is real time but it has all the quirks of a TBS game. It sucks. Its just freaking aweful. Either go real time like Men of War or turn based like the older games to what I know or any good turn based game. Instead what we have here is a game with a system that plain dousn't work. Its a bad combination of elements from either.\n\nBasically what happens is you try to plan something out than something goes wrong and it all falls apart faster than you can do anything about it partially because of the clunkiness of the game as a whole but also because it just dousn't work. I had to save and load and repeat just to beat the first mission. It took over an hour. Planning or not, dousn't matter. Silencers don't do much since the enemy AI is already brain dead and pretty much just runs straight at you occasionally doing some interesting flanking stuff but Im not sure thats even on purpose. I say Im not sure because this game sucks so bad I can't get very far in it. I havn't played the originals but they cannot be this bad.\n\nThere are just alot of things that are off about this game. They should have stayed TBS as it would solve alot of them. Its just flawed in its core elements.

I welcome the improvement in the game like the 'Plan & Go' system which many die-hard fans were suspicious of - it really helps make the game more enjoyable to play with its fast-paced action. It cuts back on a lot of tedium of the conventional turn based orders but the system still offers you great amount of flexibility to pause and issue very carefully thought out orders to your squad with actions which could be synchronized so it gets the best part of turn based gameplay.\n\nThere are several features which may disappoint such as the lack of fog of war, the way you can't always loot what enemies carry, some unrealistic stats for some weapons and an interface which can be more streamlined especially with managing, selling, transferring inventory on your mercs. But thankfully a lot of these issues are already addressed by mods you can install.\n\n","April 11, 2012","true","35.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The inventory system is a mess, want to repair the guns all these gun you looted? You have to equip each gun and swap them out every time. Supply system is a tedious and invovles running naked people to and from the airport, looking for vendors to buy and sell your loot while waiting for the sipment of supplies. A lot of your game time is wasted just doing that. AI is downright stupid. they run right at you and are highly accurate no matter how much of an disadvantage they are in. The planning system rarely goes as planned thanks to the dumb AI and blocking/pathfinding issues, be prepared to bump into stuff, spin in circles, crouch or prone for no reason, walk instead of run, turn an easy throw of a grenade that lands at your feet. Line of sight is awful, somehow enemies are able to see me through walls or windows even though I'm crouched or prone. Enemy patrols take over zones you had liberated without much effort even when the miltia is upgraded.

The combat system is real time but it has all the quirks of a TBS game. It sucks. Its just freaking aweful. Either go real time like Men of War or turn based like the older games to what I know or any good turn based game. Instead what we have here is a game with a system that plain dousn't work. Its a bad combination of elements from either.\n\nBasically what happens is you try to plan something out than something goes wrong and it all falls apart faster than you can do anything about it partially because of the clunkiness of the game as a whole but also because it just dousn't work. I had to save and load and repeat just to beat the first mission. It took over an hour. Planning or not, dousn't matter. Silencers don't do much since the enemy AI is already brain dead and pretty much just runs straight at you occasionally doing some interesting flanking stuff but Im not sure thats even on purpose. I say Im not sure because this game sucks so bad I can't get very far in it. I havn't played the originals but they cannot be this bad.\n\nThere are just alot of things that are off about this game. They should have stayed TBS as it would solve alot of them. Its just flawed in its core elements.

There's the Story (within that, the character development), The Gameplay (within that, the difficulty), The Graphics (within this, the audio as well as the visual.) and the game's ability to be enjoyed (and replayability, of course.). Naturally, there's also bugs as an issue but, that's something that works out over time.\n\nJA:BIA is a Mediocre game. It has passable graphics and audio (for a relatively minor B grade game), next to no story (they didn't need to develop the story - the story existed from the origins of this game) and acceptable gameplay. The Gameplay is RTwP (real time with pause) which is a fantastic genre that people don't see enough of, or appreciate at all. While it's not the TBS of the original games, this particular form of gameplay is very entertaining, bringing one to the last note on this list, the game's ability to be enjoyed.\n\nIf you have played the original JA games, you probably won't like this as a JA game. IF you pretend it's not a JA game, it's pretty fun. So, my word to you is to play it as if it were not a JA game, but simply a game to stand on its own two feet. It deserves some attention for its gameplay delivery. I'd give it a solid 6/10. It's not fantastic, but you'll definitely get your money's worth.","October 3, 2014","true","158.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Its a lousy Jagged Alliance game. But its a great game on its own right. The issue is that they changed the combat system and a lot of core mechanics that are at the heart of a Jagged Alliance game. Had they released this as a separate series and kept everything else the same - the game would have been received a lot better.","August 18, 2014","true","53.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And new players who hate it because well…  it’s a hard game to like.   I fall into about the .01% who actually really liked the game a lot.   I enjoyed both the combat and the ability to mod the game.   I tinkered for hours and hours with the weapons and download great mods that introduced new gear.   I would love to tell you that if only players would do X they too could love the game but alas I can’t.  All the things that make 99% of all gamers hate the game are things I was able to overlook.  Let’s take the inventory management for example, before the last major patch from Bit-Composer managing your inventory was something written straight out of hell.  Of the 300 some hours I have playing I would guess that somewhere around 140 of them were not playing just managing the darn inventory.  Then you have the fans, I understand JA was a fun game but that was over a decade ago.  Folks just couldn’t separate the old game from this new version and accept it for what it was.   Folks took it as some personal slight that BitComposer was out to ruin the JA name.   From the horrible AI, to the poor game making skills for bitComposer JABIA was guaranteed to be hated.  Yet inside this hot mess of a game lies something that I personally find fun and enjoyable, and I just can’t explain why.    Perhaps for only me I would rate this game   88/100   for everyone else 65/100","April 5, 2012","true","396.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay is a bit better than earlier and I really like the active pause and action planning with possibility to time actions of your merc's.The change from actions based on turn/point into times needed in active mode.\n\nLess weapons to choose from, less accesories and no more DIY accesories. Health regained instantly after applying meds (no need to w8 for them to heal) - exception when your merc was revived. Merc's are employed for the whole game (at least it seems so) - it was bit of a pain to remember to renew your contract but it was more realistic + earlier you could hire more expensive merc's for a shorter time. You can only hire military by giving them a weapon personally (the pain ...) , I preffered older militia training rather than this "new" way.","August 16, 2012","true","49.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've never played the old ones but I really do like the concept and general gameplay. It's also nice to play a challenging RPG for once though the difficulty curve is really uneven.\n\nThat said, this is a title published by a B-producer and it REALLY shows. There are massive amounts of glitches, quirks, dumb things, and the UI really needs a good streamlining/overhaul in general. The first thing that happened to one of my mecs was climbing a ladder with no way to stop them. And even after I'd learned everthing regarding combat, I still make lots of mistakes regarding stances, guard mode etc. Fortunately the game has an autosave feature every combat, but having to use it to fix a mistake feels really cheesy...\n\nI still like it a lot though, despite the flaws. This is my type of game, managing a mercenary company on a world map picking your targets and building a team as versatile or specialized as you want is fun.","August 19, 2012","true","110.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The learning curve is somewhat steep, but after capturing 3-4 villages, the battles get incredibly hard with 6-8 well equipped soldiers as opponents it's extremely hard not to get your mercs killed.","February 13, 2012","true","21.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also the militia are a lot harder to keep alive in this one, and you have to fit them individually, which means upper body armour and helmets and weapons for each one have to be bought and give to them individually. Really annoying to spend 50k equipping a full militia in an area to then have them almost wiped out once you are far enough away to not be able to get back in time to help defend, but overall still fun to play.","September 12, 2012","true","165.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you can get past that, Jagged Alliance - Back in Action is quite possibly the best recent western-style squad based tactical RPG out at time of writing. The terrain is beautiful, and tactically significant. The weapons are varied and each can shine paired an appropriate combat style. The combat system is the smoothest and most satisfying attempt to meld real-time action and turn-based planning that I've ever played. Now that it's been patched, you can even adjust the tactical elements and difficulty to match the level of challenge you want. And if you're interested but not sold, Coreplay is among the disturbingly small club of developers that bothered to make a demo to introduce you to their product. Try it and see what you think... just don't charge toward the red marks as soon as the map loads. That's for bulls.","July 13, 2012","true","265.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game, in opinion, would be a lot better if I had a hacked voice pack from the second game. The characters and lines are exactly the same. The models and pictures are touched up, so in that respect it is good. The combat is ... weird. A Real/slow time base where all you can do is slow the combat, and not pause, It takes a bit of work, but it can be done. I see WHY they did it, but JA fans are looking for the turn based, not the new age. Yet, you have to drag in new characters to have a title exist. The old fan base won't be good enough to support it. If you took the models of this, the voices and play of the second, and the music of this you would have a rockin' game in opinion. It's mediocre at best, and down right frustrating. Seriously tho, if it had all the old voices, and ported it into this game, it would be decent. There is a reason I haven't got a lot of time racked up in this game.","December 31, 2014","false","115.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

(and do not fool yourself, the highly recommended "realistic mods" do not make this game even a bit better.\n\n- mercs do not retain formation when moved as squad. a squad movement command will always default to the standard formation: 2 mercs in front line, 2 in the backline. when you now issue an attack command, the 2 mercs in the backline will kill the two in front of them. micromanaging all mercs is not always desirable.\n- abilities mean "virtualy" nothing. sure, 100strength = 100 hitpoints, 100agility = 100stamina and you need 10mechanical in order to use weapon oil, but besides that...  dexterity and marksmanship are required to calculate "hit probability", but there is no difference between 60dex 40marksman and 100 100. there is no difference between 50 and 100 perception. more strength does not make you inflict more melee damage. intelligence is also worthless. enemies spot you, no matter if you got the right camouflage, moving at night and your stealth is 100, even if you are not moving and hiding at 200m distance in a brush.\n- camouflage not working\n- stealth not working, you just need to be in the point of view of the enemy and he got you\n- line of sight is only true for you, not the ai (especialy funny, when you are up on a roof in prone stance and the emey a) spots you (lol) and shoots andhits you, while you can not shoot back.\n- every AI soldier is a master at arms, who have 100% hit chance at any range, from any position, no matter if the players mercs are hidden and behind some cover\n- tactics are not possible\na) only about 30% of the enemy forces are actualy patroling. everyone else is hunkered down in a perfect position, waiting for you to come, even if you let them wait 10 days.\nb) sneaking to an unuspecting guard and killing it, does not work, thanks to not working stealth and perception.\nc) there is no good positioning, or flanking. the enemy always hit you, regardless of cover and when you are engaged in combat, all your mercs positions are miracurously known by the enemies.\n\nevery encounter in this game is a shootout between your mercs and the enemies, without cover, on plain field. whoever brings the best weapons, wins.\n\nany difficulty / challenge in this game comes from the extremely sloppy programming, frustration will be your constant companion during this game.\n\nthe realistic rebalancing and combat evolved mods are making things a bit better, but just a bit.","February 18, 2015","false","46.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you are a fan of this, just go away, you will not like what I have to say about this sad, sorry, S.O.B. of a game. Most of my game time is because I left the game on overnight and did not notice until the next morning.\n\nI want to give this a good review, I really do. But in good concience, I can't. In fact I hate the blasted thing. And I have been putting off writing this in hopes that it would be fixed, but so much for that. This is the first Jagged Alliance game I have ever had  and at first I liked it, then I actually began playing it. The game is frought with bugs, logic failures and factual errors, alot of them. To begin with the game will crash ittermitantly for no particular reason and it is not my rig (MSI Redline modified by XoticPC). Then there are the other little annoying things, character pictures go all fuzzy and you sometimes pop around the map with lag, but I could live with that if it wern't for the gameplay. Oh god, here it comes. Your characters are absoutly clueless and need major micromanaging to keep them on target. You literally have to hold their hands through every single encouter. Who to aim at, kneel, stand, run, where to go ect. I would not be suprised if they needed instruction on how to wipe their virtal hinies. They will not even return fire unless given explicit orders to fire at a specific target. I can hear you yelling at me through your screen, "Use the Guard Mode!". Yes, you could use the guard mode but that does not use the full range of the weapon only acone of what the character can "see". With fog of war on this makes sense, with it off, not so much. Another problem, if you order them to move to a location and the dinkleberry pathefinder system doesn't think they can fit in just right, they bounce around in the space like so many pinballs cought between a pair of bumpers. In a combination of these two problems, you can actually kill off your whole squad with friendly fire. If you have lets say six guys lined up behind cover and somebody pops up on your flank while guard mode is on, the far character will actually drill rounds through the rest of the squad like a 10 year old playing CoD. Moving on to the other  bits, few of the vanilla guns have proper names, all grenades, cannon shots and tank rounds look like smoke grenades and the reloading is a bit too short for mgs. But the most game breaking thing about this is also the biggest logical error. If you leave the enemy alone long enough, you will be facing a bunch of Navy Seals guarding a garbage dump, no kidding, I saw 6 Spec Ops (Lvl 5 enemies) looking after Queen D's rubish pile. This is just stupid for lack of a better word, there are steep learning curves then there is this. This is worse than unfair, it is just totally illogical. It makes not sense to sit your best guys on your least important junk. I'm sorry but this just kills the game.\n\nFor those like myself that like comprehensive stuff, I'll break it down.\n\nConcept 8/10\nI like the Idea behind the game, lead a gurrillia war against an opressive dictator with mercs and liberate the country, in other words, every JA game in the cookie oven. Still, it had so much potential and was dropped it in the mud. Tsk, tsk.\n\nGraphics 6/10\nThey are not bad but are way under par for a title like this made a scant 3 years back. The whole thing just feel kind of janky. This inculudes the buggy gliches and whatnot.\n\nInterface 5/10\nEven worse than the graphics, still feels cheap and lacks fluidity to the placement to the buttons and some thigs are missing totally from the interface.\n\nStability/Moddability 3/10\nMods can be found for this If you look for them, but there are not that many, also, this does not have workshop available. When you do find a mod, only use one, mabe two if they are dissimilar because this is buggy as is and mods are notthe best thing to throw at something like that. Some mods do correct some of the problems with the game, but I have yet to find one that can fix that stupid enemy generator. I run a realism one to correct some of those aforementioned errors but that is like empting the ocean with a pale and shovel. And a good modder should not have to make up for the numerous ♥♥♥♥ ups by the devs.\n\nGameplay -10/10\n\nYes, I said negative 10, if you don't like that, tuff turkey. This just kills it for me, like I said above, there are aspects of the game that just make you want to hit something. Incredibly frusterating and totally illogical. The enemy just steamroles you if you do not skip about 70% of the areas and make a mad dash for the finish line. Yes,you can skip most of the game and just go for the jugular, but what is the bloody point of the game if you are just going to end it in 5 game days anyway? P.S. The DLCs are a rip off.\n\nConclusion (11/5)/10 I ain't breaking out a calculator for this. Bad, it's just bad.\n\nSo, the game could have been much better if the Devs game a darn. But as I played the game, I felt that the game had alot of rough edges, almost like it was done very quickly on a beer budget while trying to make a champagne title. Many of the aspects do not make sense and the map looks like an ink blot on constuction paper. In other words, this could be better played if you had Seal Team 6 an a couple of helicopters.  Now I know I am going to get a lot of "learn to play" BS out of the fans of this game, I have one thing to say to you, shut up. If somebody was shooting at you and you had a rifle in your hand would you just sit and stare into space? No you would pull the trigger and not wait for someone to tell you to do it. (Well, I would, if you have a 1000 plus hours on this game, lets face it, you live in your mom's basement and would soil yourself and have a heart attack if someone shot at you). Final take away, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIf you want an RTS that has pause and has some RPG elements and feels like a gurrilla type thing, I got nothing for you, can't think of a thing for you sorry.\n\n\nUpdate: I have found a mod combo that does make this better and have found it to be more playable. However that does not change my views of the base game for which this review is for.","December 6, 2015","false","254.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It was very hard game, with strong team management and fruitfull (and very frustratic) battles over all places in Arulco. Sinde then, any many many mods we all waits for an other step into the genre.\n\nInstead of next step we have simply remake. It has very nice graphic, and new deep of battles density thanks to plan'n'action game style. Please, take a note: this is not RTS game, your boys and girls dies bloody fast (and aims terribly bad). You need to use covers, silence killing, melee skills, land mines and everything you can got from you squads (automated rocket rifle rocks!). On this part I haven't found many bugs (most likely game is well patched now), only one frustratic bug:\nWhen your mercs are in small space, AI have very big issues to avoid collissions. I don'd need to explain that such situation during firefight usually ends with save loading or with farewell to your wonderfull killers.\n\nOf course in compare to the previous JA game (especially JA2), this product have some not implemented features, and that  makes game too easy on management level (especially if you don't want to speed up too much like me):\n- Merc contract NEVER ends - so if you play a long game, it's quite easy to have almost all mercs (obviously some of them don't want to work with each other)\n- Mines resources (so also your income) never ends.\n\nI hope, I don't need to explain that without such limitations, you end up with stack of useless money (I've ended with 900k), for which you're buing repair kits, special ammo or Guardian vests at best. Most of the weapon or ammo, or even bunch of granades are easy to gather from army of dead enemies.\n\nAlso If you gather good team with 2 paramedics and 1 Sniper (I've used my Amazon team for this with Raven, Spider, Fox, Vicki and 2 others) then you can simply go through the whole map, in the gaps between enemy zones and simply take over southern Sam site (next to Meduna). After that you can be sure that any Queen attacking party will be stopped there, and it's very easy to defend in entrance, especially with mine field.\n\nSo in general: I liked game VERY much, I enjoyed the time I spent on it and for sure I'll back to it with some mods that are available over internet, but for some veterans it might be a little bit too easy, especially when you setup your ground.","May 11, 2014","true","98.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supahtree/recommended/57740/","Supahtree","SupahTree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supahtree/","270 products in account","I see this game has mixed reviews so I figured I'd put in my 4 cents. I'll put the Pros/Cons at the bottom for the tl;dr version.\n\nWhen I first saw this game I thought the game mechanics looked interesting. The game is played in a kind of tactical overview in real-time, but it allows for you to pause everything and plan out your next moves. The game also offers quite a large list of auto-pause options such as "When an enemy spots a team member". I thought this was a nice touch, as it gives you peace of mind that one of your mercenaries will not waltz to their death while you try to deal with another.\n\nI started the game on hard and with enemies not visible. I feel like this adds a nice challenge, especially to those new to the genre. I can understand why people would dislike having enemies always visible on the map, it really takes away from the stealthy part of the game and makes being cautious pointless, as you know where the danger lies. So I strongly suggest to at least play with enemies hidden.\n\nThere is a vast list of mercenaries that you can hire of varying degrees of skill. Of course the more skilled mercenaries will cost more, so much that you will be unable to get them until a bit later in the game. However, all mercenaries gain experience from killing enemies or doing certain actions (successfully lock picking door, healing a team member, etc.). Allowing XP to be gained not just from killing enemies is a nice touch I'd say. This allows for your medic who may not be the best shot to still level up some while taking care of your team.\n\nMaps are large and have nice detail and plenty to stumble across. The world map plays out by having squads of your mercenaries slide about as "Squad A" "Squad B" etc. You'll start with 3 to 4 mercenaries and build your way up from there. This can get a bit tedious once you have a few squads you need to manage at the same time, it also becomes a bit hectic since the enemy will be sending squads to "Recapture" towns/outposts that you've liberated. This is probably my biggest complaint of the game. Once you defeat all the enemies of an area it is considered "liberated". Once liberated there are militiamen that SHOULD defend the town that you've taken back for them. However, I've never had an instance when the militia were able to fend off invaders. Therefore, you need to go back to the conquered town and recapture it. I have seen some people say that leaving a mercenary in each town will be good enough to fend off attacks, but I haven't tried this out yet.\n\nOf course the best part of the game is the combat and not the micromanagement. There are multiple stances that each mercenary can take that will affect their aim (prone, crouch, etc.), each has its pros/cons, and you'll need to think about how your attack will play out before sending them in. In my experience I've had some cases call for a sniper while I flank with pistols/assault rifles (open field), while others have me using a flash bang and then sending in two shotgun wielding mercenaries to blast away multiple enemies that have bottlenecked into a room/hallway.\n\nThe AI can be kind of dumb at times, but overall I'd say the game presents a nice challenge.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is definitely worth the price, especially if it's on sale.\n\nPros:\n- A nice challenge if you have the settings right (no enemy visibility, hard)\n- A variety of weapons for every occasion with attachments! (Rifle w/ scope, silenced pistol, frag grenades, shotguns, etc.)\n- Maps are large and the ability to plan out your actions before an attack is nice (have teammates hold fire until others are in position, have some mercenaries run to flank while another draws fire, etc.)\n- It has been able to keep me entertained for a while, and I still come back to it.\n\nCons:\n- Micromanagement can be annoying (You have to sell items from each merc's inventory, so if one merc is not near the shop, they must run to it. It's not a huge annoyance to me though.)\n- Militia are pretty useless. Once you capture a town I shouldn't feel 95% positive that I'm going to lose it if I venture off to complete more of the story.\n- Can be a bit slow to start up. I may just suck at the game, but it took me the longest time to get from 4 mercs to 5 mercs. There may be big money later in the game that I haven't gotten to yet.","December 23, 2014","true","51.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't conducive to enjoyment while learning.\n\nOver all unless you are hardcore into this real time type of combat game I recommend staying clear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supahtree/recommended/57740/","Supahtree","SupahTree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supahtree/","270 products in account","I see this game has mixed reviews so I figured I'd put in my 4 cents. I'll put the Pros/Cons at the bottom for the tl;dr version.\n\nWhen I first saw this game I thought the game mechanics looked interesting. The game is played in a kind of tactical overview in real-time, but it allows for you to pause everything and plan out your next moves. The game also offers quite a large list of auto-pause options such as "When an enemy spots a team member". I thought this was a nice touch, as it gives you peace of mind that one of your mercenaries will not waltz to their death while you try to deal with another.\n\nI started the game on hard and with enemies not visible. I feel like this adds a nice challenge, especially to those new to the genre. I can understand why people would dislike having enemies always visible on the map, it really takes away from the stealthy part of the game and makes being cautious pointless, as you know where the danger lies. So I strongly suggest to at least play with enemies hidden.\n\nThere is a vast list of mercenaries that you can hire of varying degrees of skill. Of course the more skilled mercenaries will cost more, so much that you will be unable to get them until a bit later in the game. However, all mercenaries gain experience from killing enemies or doing certain actions (successfully lock picking door, healing a team member, etc.). Allowing XP to be gained not just from killing enemies is a nice touch I'd say. This allows for your medic who may not be the best shot to still level up some while taking care of your team.\n\nMaps are large and have nice detail and plenty to stumble across. The world map plays out by having squads of your mercenaries slide about as "Squad A" "Squad B" etc. You'll start with 3 to 4 mercenaries and build your way up from there. This can get a bit tedious once you have a few squads you need to manage at the same time, it also becomes a bit hectic since the enemy will be sending squads to "Recapture" towns/outposts that you've liberated. This is probably my biggest complaint of the game. Once you defeat all the enemies of an area it is considered "liberated". Once liberated there are militiamen that SHOULD defend the town that you've taken back for them. However, I've never had an instance when the militia were able to fend off invaders. Therefore, you need to go back to the conquered town and recapture it. I have seen some people say that leaving a mercenary in each town will be good enough to fend off attacks, but I haven't tried this out yet.\n\nOf course the best part of the game is the combat and not the micromanagement. There are multiple stances that each mercenary can take that will affect their aim (prone, crouch, etc.), each has its pros/cons, and you'll need to think about how your attack will play out before sending them in. In my experience I've had some cases call for a sniper while I flank with pistols/assault rifles (open field), while others have me using a flash bang and then sending in two shotgun wielding mercenaries to blast away multiple enemies that have bottlenecked into a room/hallway.\n\nThe AI can be kind of dumb at times, but overall I'd say the game presents a nice challenge.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is definitely worth the price, especially if it's on sale.\n\nPros:\n- A nice challenge if you have the settings right (no enemy visibility, hard)\n- A variety of weapons for every occasion with attachments! (Rifle w/ scope, silenced pistol, frag grenades, shotguns, etc.)\n- Maps are large and the ability to plan out your actions before an attack is nice (have teammates hold fire until others are in position, have some mercenaries run to flank while another draws fire, etc.)\n- It has been able to keep me entertained for a while, and I still come back to it.\n\nCons:\n- Micromanagement can be annoying (You have to sell items from each merc's inventory, so if one merc is not near the shop, they must run to it. It's not a huge annoyance to me though.)\n- Militia are pretty useless. Once you capture a town I shouldn't feel 95% positive that I'm going to lose it if I venture off to complete more of the story.\n- Can be a bit slow to start up. I may just suck at the game, but it took me the longest time to get from 4 mercs to 5 mercs. There may be big money later in the game that I haven't gotten to yet.","December 23, 2014","true","51.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just enjoy it.  The difficulty curve in the game is a little sharp (starts out really easy for a few missions and then swings way out of balance in the opposite direction a couple missions later and stays there) and sometimes characters get stuck on actions you give them (you will, at some point, scream "I told you to get down, you [explitive deleted]!"), and the AI often charges you one at a time like a group of bad guys in a cheesey samurai/western/martial arts film, but for some reason, I've logged well over two hundred hours in the game.  Crazy.\n\nWorth noting that the Combat Evolved mod adds a ton of weapons (and balances them), armor, other equipment, new mercenaries, and rounds the sharpness out of the difficulty curve.  I highly recommend that if the base game doesn't float your boat.  About half my play time has been with that mod.\n\nI enjoy the game despite its flaws, though I would buy it when its on sale.

Great game for turn based RPG.  RNG monster isn't always against you.  I wouldn't recommend melee combat.  Even with a great merc with perfect stealth you often don't one shot a mob and they end up doing serious damage to your sneaking merc.  Much easier to get close and use a silenced handgun.  Game gets extremely easy after a couple play throughs when you realize you can pretty much sneak to zones you shouldn't be in to get the best weapons in the game way too early.  It is possible to win the entire game with 1-2 mercs.  Not bashing this game at all.  I love it completely.

These games are classics! When I read the reviews of this version, I thought  omg this doen't look good. But when I saw that the bundle was on sale, ok, why not! Let's try this! I'm happy that I bought it. It's different when you played the first two Jagged Alliance but it will grow on ya. Now, I only play the game with Realistic Rebalancing Mod, because it fixes bugs, ads weapons etc.\n\n+ graphics looks nice\n+ healing + repairing is instant\n+ exp system, whenever you do something, you gain xp\n+ tactical screen is nice\n+ you don't have to pay the mercs overy week, just one fee\n+ autosave at start level and before every combat event\n\n- you can't create your own merc anymore\n- you can only repair guns, so no repairing armor etc.\n- only one weapon slot (for silencer or scope), so you can't do both","July 23, 2015","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my 67 hours of Liberating Arulco it crashed only 2 times. It is a worthy remake, and I recommend it! Sure, some of the things could be done better/ differently - but it is fun!\n\nPro:\n- a lot of freedom of how-to-proceed\n- ...how to kill\n- ...and which mercenaries to hire\n- side missions\n- JA!!!!\n\nCon:\n- you find a lot of details of how-it-could-be-done-better, and get angry that these tiny changes aren´t there\n- difficult at first, easy once you have a dream team\n- really stupid AI\n- your team is not clever either\n- no aliens :-(","July 16, 2015","true","67.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it does drop a few of the features that made JA2 amazing (like the ability to assign tasks to mercs that are idle, like training, etc) it still feels like a faithful remake. So yeah, a pretty good experience, I would suggest picking it up if it's on sale (Which is likely).","July 13, 2012","true","79.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They used the faces of real people as the models for the characters, and then rendered them, much like modern games, and had some of the best voice acting to give your mercs some personality. This game doesn't have either of these two things.\n\nJA2 also used a Turn Based Strategy gameplay that had you gripping your mouse and keyboard going "♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥, did I make the right call?", and this game doesn't have that either.\n\nI have NEVER been more disappointed by anything in my entire life. Developing this game was the worst insult anybody could have done to the JA series, and buying it is a great was to lose your money.\n\nWatching the Starwars Prequels and playing DNF straight after is a better use of your time.","February 12, 2012","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
