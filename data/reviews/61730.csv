"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/recommended/61730/","lickbrains","Junebug #1376","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/","281 products in account","From the creators of Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery comes one of my favorite puzzle games. It was the first game I bought on Steam and I went in not knowing what to expect. It is the definition of pleasant surprise. I found myself having giggle-ragefits and fistpumping at creating awesome chains. I love everything about it. I love the humor, the art, the diverse mechanics, the puzzles, and its surprising amount of depth. I don't say this often but it's worth it full price. I honestly cannot think of a flaw unless you hate cute things. The story is one you rarely see in a game: You're Biggs and you're trying to be a good father to your starving kid. Your goal is to keep the island free of cute critters and vomit rainbows into your child's mouth to keep him fed while a human traveler discovers new things about your homeland! The information he uncovers is pretty interesting.\n\nIt has online multiplayer capability, single player, and has a leaderboard for people who really wanna challenge themselves and score massive combos. The online multiplayer has Co-Op and Versus mode, both very fun to play with friends. The single player mode offers an Adventure, Puzzles, Challenges, and unlockable Survival modes. For one puzzle type, you're given a number of moves to get rid of all the critters. If you deplete those moves and the critters aren't gone, you'll be mobbed by a flurry of adorable creatures. Succeed and you can proceed to more difficult levels.\n\nI enjoyed the crap out of this game and I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves puzzles, cute things, and/or something to sit back and relax to. Not enough peoploe play this game and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\n8.5/10","December 30, 2013","true","8.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/protongue/recommended/61730/","protongue","Protongue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/protongue/","229 products in account","Gameplay: Each campaign world introduces a new mechanic, gently expanding Critter Crunch's basic puzzle premise into a diverse field of interactions. The variety of special critters and abilities produces a deep optimization exercise. I had great fun with the puzzle and challenge levels - they encourage studying move consequences that would otherwise go unnoticed in the frenzy of clearing the board.\n\nControls: Generally quick and responsive, which is ideal for what becomes a twitch puzzler at high levels. However, I wish it took the same time to interact with critters regardless of screen position. Waiting for Biggs' tongue to extend for high-hanging critters needlessly breaks the flow/pacing.\n\nPresentation: The atmosphere of Critter Crunch is beautiful - smiling sprites, vibrant colors, and upbeat tunes. Biggs has so many animation frames that it's fun to pause the game to see what expression the little fellow has at that instant. Funny storyline, definitely the most enjoyable ending within this genre!","January 1, 2015","true","119.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With the rows of creatures having similarities, it might even seem like a match 3 puzzler. But its not! In fact, its a quite unique spin on the genre. Instead of matching like objects, you will instead use the critters as a food chain of sorts.\n\nIn Critter Crunch, you play the role of Biggs, a puffy orange and white looking creature who looks like he would fit right at home in a Nintendo game. He's cute, he's adorable, and he has a big appetite for gems. As Biggs, you will be running back and forth on the screen grabbing critters, and rearrangfing them or ultimately feeding them to each other. Smaller critters feed the critters one size up from them. 2 critters, or a stuffed critter, will make the bigger critter explode, releasing gems for Biggs to eat. There are in the spirit of these type of puzzle games, special objects to help or hurt you in the game, as they appear as pieces throughout the rows. For instance, bombs may appear, which can clear out a section of critters. Biggs' son even pops up if you clear a chain of 8 critters, allowing for a huge score boost. All in all, very fun puzzle mechanics in this title.\n\nWhat's more is that this game looks gorgeous. Probably the nicest looking puzzle game I have come across on Steam. It's not popping with particle effects, or 3D. Instead, it chooses a hand drawn high res sprite look, that you would expect to see in a game like Rayman Origins for example. the animations for Biggs are wonderful also. The game is very colorful, but not in a seizure inducing sort of way. Everything just looks extremely crisp, and smooth.\n\nBuy this game!","November 22, 2012","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Now this game not only looks great (of course the manga style, cuteness and humor is not everyone's taste, in this case I personally really like it), it is also one of the very few puzzlers with some new ideas, and they even work brilliantly. In the first few levels you might think the mechanics are too complicated for fast-paced puzzle thrills, but it's actually all quite simple and you'll get the hang of it quite quickly (plus the Adventure Mode slowly shows you all the different critters and power foods). When you're through adventure mode, there are still dozens of puzzle levels (very cool, btw!), challenge levels (very tricky, btw!), the survival mode (that's what these games are all about in the end, right?) aaaand then there's local and online Co-op and versus modes...the only set back: There is hardly ever anyone online! Why doesn't anyone seem to know about this game? Totally underrated! The only things that bug me a bit are that there's no indication of when the row goes down and that survival mode is over a little fast because it gets tough rather quickly.\nAnyway, get it and let's have a match :]\n\n8.5/10","December 1, 2012","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Local co-op with a friend is excellent and we are currently ranked in the 60's. Local versus is a blast. The Xbox 360 controller works like a charm. And by using a program called DS4 Windows my friend is able to use his PS4 controller too. The graphics are exactly what the preview shots look like, somewhat anime-ish with painted backgrounds. I really like it. Music is great. The critters drop down slow at first but if you can survive then the game really does pick up pace, or there is a button you can press to make the rows drop faster. There are a bunch of funny items and tricks to learn. I recommend playing adventure mode first to learn how the game works. But it's also pretty fun to go into local co-op and versus blind with your friend and figure the game out together. Right now we are playing through adventure mode by taking turns and helping one another out (also yelling at each other and making dirty jokes). It's been hilarious. I want it to never end. But even after the main game is completed there are puzzle and challange modes, and always the faithfully entertaining versus and co-op.","March 29","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The goal is simple; feed Biggs. To do this you have to eat small creatures, spit them out into bigger ones, eat those and spit these out into even bigger ones. After that, you have to collect the crystals that drop. That's right, Biggs eats crystals. While it all sounds fairly simple so far, it really is not. Each level introduces a new rule or gameplay mechanic, making it increasingly more difficult, but also keeps it challenging and fresh.\nOh, the game has some lovely, colorful 2D graphics, by the way. It really fits the game's theme.\nI don't even have to say this game is worth it...

It wasn't until I described the game to someone that I realised how ridiculous the concept is. You are a fuzzy creature you feeds insect to each other until they explode and drop crystals, oh and you vomit rainbows over another fuzzy creature for no discernible reason. The silliness is part of the charm of the game, also the visual style is very cute and the underlying gameplay is sound. The problem is there is just too much going on, you start off with the basic insects and it is great fun. Then you get more and more types of insects until you no longer have time to weigh up the different possible moves in time. The best parts of the game are the puzzle levels where you have a limited number of moves and no time constraint. I started to find the main levels an annoyance between me and the next puzzle level. So yes there is fun to be had here but it is not one that going to keep me playing for hour after hour.","September 15, 2013","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it is way more fun than it has a right to be. The character style is very anime-like, which I like, and the humor is tongue-in-cheek on the game's entire premise. The mechanics are different than any other coming-down-from-top, pop-the-bubbles/whatever game that I have seen. Instead of shooting matching bubbles from the bottom, you grab a "critter" from one column and spit it out in another. Your goal is to pop the critters by over-feeding them and gobbling up the crystals that come out (which is another running tongue-in-cheek gag). Sometimes if you get a large enough chain, you get to barf rainbow juice into your son's mouth for bonus points. I'm only about 4 main levels in, and each new mechanic they have added has been interesting without being too hard to pick up.\n\nProbably my only dislike so far is that I can't find a way to restart a puzzle level without just wasting all my moves and waiting for the critters to come beat up the main character (which was amusing the first couple times, I'll admit). Oh, and that the only way to advance through the screens (like tutorials, final scores, etc) is to click on a mildly-small button in the bottom right. Just a little hard to hit it quickly after being used to the fast reactions in the levels.","May 3, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From fast-paced challenges to puzzles that make you think, there are plenty of different modes and levels to keep you playing.  I could happily feed critters and puke rainbows all day. The levels can range from easy to very hard and some may even make you want to rage quit. However in adventure mode you only need to complete 3 per area to unlock the next set and once the other modes are open you can always skip levels and leave the harder ones for later. Overall I think there's plenty of challenge and gameplay for your money and if it's on sale it's a no-brainer for any puzzle fan.","September 1, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Creatures come down from vines, and you feed them to each other to pop chains of like critters, with upward-falling combos, chains of fed critters, and special cirtter types to spice of the action.  The aesthetic is charming and is a wonderfully strong aspect of this game.\n\nThe game features a 'story' mode to introduce you to the game mechanics, a puzzle mode, score attack mode (with online coop possible), a challenge mode, and an online versus mode.   The online versus is likely not thriving but if you can get a few friends (like me since you're reading my review!) to play with you, you're probably set.\n\nPretty fun, I'd reccomend picking it up.","January 27, 2013","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
