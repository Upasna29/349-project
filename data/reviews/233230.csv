Every time I reach the final goal, and the credits roll, and the music plays I think of creator Richard Perrin and his father — and the loss of my own — but it’s hopeful and optimistic. Still the entire experience exhibits a sense of loss and recapitulates same. For me the game is an expression that I enjoy somewhat plaintively in its context.\n\nI play it often enough at my three-year-old's insistent request. He has none of this context! But he still wants to come back again and again. He finds it mesmerizing as he instructs me where to go and what to inspect next — the first time, his eyes wide in amazement. I think at his age he's captivated by the geometry and the color (children's entertainment is generally far from this). “Go see where the blocks are painted!”, “Go to the black moon!”, “Go in the elevator!”, “Show me the dinosaur!”, “Fly into the sky!” He’s still surprised when the environment springs to life. I’m surprised to see we’ve wandered around Kairo for over 150 hours in the last year or so.\n\nIn short, a moving experience for a parent, and a curious adventure for a child. Play it together. Appreciate the time you have together.\n\nSo really, this is a thank you note. Thank you, Richard Perrin and the rest that made Kairo possible.","October 7, 2014","true","172.2"," 169 of 175 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","169","175","2","0"

Green, but not a green like living plants, but a green like something sickly and dying. Rotten. Slimy. It is a long corridor, and unlike the other places I have visited, it is somewhat claustrophobic. Large caskets line the sides of the corridor, and as I walk slowly along, looking for something I am expected to do, I stop and investigate one.\n\nThere is a monitor on each casket. Some are broken, some flicker with static, but this one shows an image, though of what, I cannot see. I stand there for awhile, longer maybe than I should, waiting for something to appear on that monitor, but if the image changes, it is perhaps only my imagination. Or my reflection.\n\nKairo is a strange, ominous world. There are great monoliths to explore, machines that reach up to the heavens, and cramped corridors to wander through. Some rooms have puzzles, some are just desolate walkways, hanging out over an abyss.\n\nI feel I am in purgatory. The very first action this game asks you to take is a leap of faith. This is what the game expects of you- perhaps not to understand, but to experience.\n\nVisually, this game is a treat of abstract, bold art. Simple, yes, but the limited pallette serves to build the abandoned atmosphere of the game, and Kairo is more than capable of providing small details mixed in amongst the enormous structures. The appearance of the game almost looks somewhat grainy, like an old photograph.\n\nThe sound is just the howl of empty wind in enormous rooms. Rocks grind and scrape over surfaces as you move puzzles into place. There is some music, but it did not stand out to me in comparison to the rooms that whistle with loneliness.\n\nKairo is, for the most part, a puzzle game. You manipulate these great structures, these old, broken runes, to find your way through. Some of the puzzles are simple, some of them seem to make little sense, requiring simple trial and error. Kairo does provide 'hints' for each level, but they are otiose at best, perhaps deliberately. Still, there is a sense of accomplishment at defeating these particular puzzles, and a continual drive to see what might be next keeps you going.\n\nDo I understand what is going on? I feel I do. But at the same time, I feel that there are many right answers.\n\nSo, come. Walk with me for awhile.","September 10, 2014","true","8.7"," 143 of 158 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","143","158","3","12"

I think what interested me most, was the sense of ‘mystery’ that I got from the trailer. It doesn’t tell you what it is about, or why you are there or what’s going on… and to be honest this game has a real mysterious feel to it throughout the whole thing, you’re asking yourself questions on the who, what and whys but in fairness they aren’t answered all that clearly.\nAnd that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.\nI think games that are open to interpretation are great in their own way. The whole mystery and wonder to this game is great and all, but the structure and direction can sometimes make you just feel lost. At least for me anyways, that’s just my opinion of course, but there was a few times during the play through that I just asked, what the hell am I supposed to be doing here…\n\nThe puzzles themselves are very interesting, they are creative, they really make you think and make you put things together in ways that I’m not really used to. They are unique kinds of puzzles and there is a lot of symbols and shapes and colours that you have to try and think about what they might mean and what the logic behind the puzzle might be.\n\nThe music in the game is very moody, it really brings out that feel of the game. Which for me was quite cold, and dull. There isn’t really a whole lot of “bright” warm colours in the game, there is still colour, but it feels dulled down. There’s also a lot of white in the game, which some people may think ‘pfft well that’s “bright”’ but to me it’s an empty kind of white. The whole game is set in ancient looking dull buildings with strange structures and dull empty colours. You’re on your own with no one around and no one to comfort you but these strange surroundings and sounds and noises that give it a little bit of a creepy twitch to it.\n\nPersonally, I liked this game. It definitely wasn't one of those games that I couldn't put down until I had finished it 100% full on in one sitting, but it was something I kept coming back to every now and then, taking breaks, until I finally completed it. It took me 15 or so hours to complete it spread over the course of two weeks or so, at times I just wanted it done because getting stuck is a real pain in this game and I felt pretty clueless. I even admit that at a few points I needed help to get past certain obstacles, but all in all I think this was a good game. I enjoyed it, it’s unique and interesting and you can tell the creator is really quite creative.\n\nIf you enjoy first person puzzle games, I would say it is something that should at least be tried. I can see how it might not be some people’s cup of tea, but I think it’s worth the experience.\n\n\nTL;DR : It's weird, buy it. Creative puzzles, eerie music and generally unique.","November 8, 2013","true","16.0"," 85 of 90 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","85","90","0","8"

After playing antichamber, I absoultely had to play Kairo.\n\nKairo is a game in which you appear to be embarking into the depths of an ancient egypt-like machine that either uses magic or technology too far beyond you to understand. Either way, Kairo is one of those games that doesn't explain anything to you (though you have the option of hints, which don't help much) so it requires a lot of problem solving and logistics on your part.\nMost of the puzzles are self-explanitory, and the ones that aren't normally are supplied with a stone or wall you have to look at. Once you find those, you then proceed to facepalm realizing how simple the complex-looking puzzle really is.  Even so, the puzzles really are challanging, to the point where I actually had to look up a walkthrough for one of them because it didn't seem to be based on any rhyme or reason (and that I couldn't find any stones or walls to explain it) I'm sure you'll identify the one I'm talking about if you play this game.\nThe story is widely open to interpretation though. There were points in the story that sent a legit chill down my spine. Other moments had me scratching my head wondering what just happened. In order to understand it, you're required to fill in a lot of blanks.\nOverall, despite it's cheap graphics and oddly slippery controls, Kairo is a game that you'll enjoy figuring out for yourself, and then be proud to finish.","November 11, 2014","true","3.0"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","68","70","0","0"

Alien-looking monoliths loom out of the colour haze, blocks shift as you move, it's unnerving and there's an overwhelming feeling of being watched and isolated at the same time. The soundscape is dominated by an unearthly ambient score, with various musical notes and effects cues when appropriate; it generates a lonely atmosphere, and Kairo never forgets that you're there to experience its world. There are three main hub areas, each containing a handful of modest puzzles, and there are several secrets and hidden glyphs to find. It shouldn't take you longer than 5 hours to finish the three main hubs, but it's worth every minute that you spend in its unique world.","December 5, 2013","true","4.0"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"

Movement is floaty and inaccurate, story is subtle and there is no meaningful interaction with puzzles or objects: only walk, run and jump.

It's a puzzle game, but you never get those satisfying "ah-ha!"moments from a puzzle successfully solved. The puzzles are often frustrating, esoteric and are rarely particularly logical. There's thankfully a built-in hint system, but that doesn't really make it any more satisfying. You end up with a more "Oh, that's what they wanted me to do? Huh, okay." than anything. The (very) minimal graphics, sound and story don't do much to entice you to slog through the rest of the game.\n\nIf you want a surreal, minimalist walking simulator, NaissencE is a much better game. If you want surreal first-person puzzling in a clean white-washed environment, go for Antichamber or even something like QUBE.\n\nI enjoy surreal/minimalist walking simulators and first-person puzzlers, but this game just doesn't do it for me.","October 6, 2014","false","2.3"," 55 of 69 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","55","69","0","1"

It is obtuse, but stylistically so, and easy to get lost in. I recommend walking around and exploring before diving in too deep, but when stuck in any given room, you can go into the menu and choose up to three Hints to help point you in the right direction - this is the saving grace of the game, as they progressively give more direction without telling you what exactly to do, so you're never actually LOST, it can just feel like it at times.\n\nThe controls are a little "floaty" - they don't feel as tight as most other first person games, but due to a lack of combat that's not necessarily a problem, just takes some getting used to. The graphics are simple, but very effective - the spectacle is quite impressive.\n\nIn addition to the normal gameplay goals, there are a series of 18 runes to find hidden about the game, one "go back and find later" puzzle where, after you exit an area, something secret opens up which you can find, and three exceptionally hard "did you notice that one little thing elsewhere? Interpret it in this abstract way here!" puzzles which you might need to look for external guides for.\n\nThe game doesn't take too long (aside from those harder puzzles) - 3-4 hours should probably be enough to get through it.\n\nI had a good time with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forgottendawn/recommended/233230/","forgottendawn","Forgotten Dawn (KKS)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forgottendawn/","182 products in account","I previously mentioned this game in my Antichamber review of some time ago for anyone who missed it, so here's my thoughts about Kairo.\n\nKairo is a minimalist abstract puzzle-exploration game, and when I say "minimalist", chances are what I'm talking about really is. Ever since the Minecraft craze, we've seen many other cube worlds around inspired by retro classics (Fez comes to mind) and Kairo is no exception to the rule, making everything look like it's made of technicolor limestone with some film grain thrown in for good measure and why not, ancient ruins from a timeless age. Basically, a highly geometrical version of the areas in Ico for those old enough to remember it.\n\nStarting by the gameplay, it's as stripped down as it can possibly be: you can only walk around the areas through the arrow keys and you can, indeed, jump with the spacebar. That's it. And that's all you need to get across the levels. The puzzle design is made in a way to never lean too much on trial-and-error and moon logic solutions, although there may be a few instances where this happens. It is, however, not the rule in this game fortunately and you generally won't need a walkthrough to finish the experience (you may need it for only a couple of puzzles at best). As mentioned before, exploration plays an important role not only as a medium of conveying certain moods but also to give a sense of structure to this abstract maze.\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of Kairo, in my opinion, is the huge amount of unused potential. The sound design, while soothing at times and as minimal as it can get, I think still fails to deliver an immersive atmosphere, relying only on very simple loops that could have been better layered and more varied. Yes, even Ambient music can reach a certain level of depth so much to give some personality and identity to a scenario, rewarding close listeners with a satisfying ambiance and helping setting the mood while staying relatively background. A soundtrack made only of a few environmental sounds, very repetitive sound effects (that freaking stone rumbling) and a bunch of droning loops don't make enough of a rewarding sonic experience to me.\n\nBut it's not just the soundtrack, it's pretty much about how this game made me wish for more the more I ran through the puzzles and areas suspended on a blank white/any primary color void for no apparent reason. I noticed newer versions of Kairo introduced some sort of achievement system and even Steam trading cards as an eye candy, but honestly, there isn't much to achieve in this game if not collecting a sequence of unexplained symbols or glyphs throughout the experience and just finish it. Those symbols are not enough of a clue to figure out a bigger, possibly even more mysterious puzzle behind, and this is a problem I encounter in most "art" games that leap in the industry by stripping away what makes an experience enjoyable and memorable marketing it as "different". This game does indeed set a playable base for a "different" experience but it's not enough and it feels unfinished, as it fails to capture the player in the bigger picture behind the world of Kairo.\n\nIf you just think of the possibilities this game could have used and then get back at the final product... It's kinda depressing and disappointing. Minimalism doesn't just mean cutting away those same elements that make an experience interesting in the first place. It means using a few of them that are already perfect on their own and sticking to those for adding depth to a complex, but never complicated concept. If you fail to tell a story through your design, it's just a pale portrait of your original idea.\n\nIn conclusion, you may give this game a chance and try it out on your own, but I personally find it easily forgettable and mediocre. If artsy exploration games with confusing mechanics aren't exactly your thing, you may skip this entirely and move to other titles.","September 14, 2014","false","5.9"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","38","51","0","4"

It's ethereal, ambient, and deserted, yet unnerving and alien. A good late night game lasting a few hours. There are puzzles each step of the exploration, and you can just do these and get the impression you're contributing to a much larger puzzle you eventually solve, or you can read into things much further. You're not given too much to go on, but you can surmise a few things. I completed it and then read a guide that showed how to solve the three non-essential puzzles which give strong indications of a deeper underlying narrative. These puzzles are a huge qualitative step up in difficulty. The main puzzles are fairly straightforward enough to not even need the hint system, but these are fiendish and involve getting hints from places well outside of the puzzle rooms and even needing the assistance of other Kairo players. I wasn't prepared to spend the time I'd spent doing the main game just hunting for ways to get these last bits, so I used a guide. If you don't have time either, I really recommend doing the same to get these last titbits as they firmly solidify hints you may have picked up throughout the main journey as to the meaning and purpose of Kairo, which is a really excellent thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/233230/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","The anatomy of a good puzzle can be a difficult thing to understand, and an even harder thing to manufacture. It can't be so easy that it feels like a pointless exercise used to fill otherwise empty space, but not so hard that it feels like it's actively fighting against you to get in your way and prevent you from moving forward. It should give you all the pieces of information you need in such a way that will allow you to naturally make the connection and reach its conclusion under your own enterprise. Ideally it will also have a specific purpose and serve a function within the game's world, if not its story. But most importantly, it has to be fun, to reward the player with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment once they do put all the pieces together in their head and turn a creative thought into glorious action. Sadly, Kairo fails on most of these counts, and by some margin.\n\nI'm a big fan of the first-person, puzzle exploration genre, so when I saw this being mentioned in the same breathe as games like Antichamber and The Stanley Parable, and especially seeing the art style in pictures and videos, I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. Unfortunately, it probably has about as much in common with those games as Gran Turismo has with Mario Kart. Initial impressions were really good. You start off at the foot of a throne on a small slab of land seemingly floating in an endless, white void, the only other feature being a large, blocky structure floating a brief distance ahead of you. Some steps invite you down into the white where you find you can freely walk among the nothingness and make your way over to the other structure. So far, so good. It's set the tone with something unique and mind-bending. Everyone loves a good mystery, so already you're compelled to venture further and find out what this strange place is and discover your role among it all... Several hours later, after having unlocked and completed everything, I still feel none-the-wiser about any of it.\n\nHaving tried to read up on it on discussion boards and such, the prevailing theory seems to be something about mass  interstellar relocation and your janitor-like role of reawakening a ship on its approach to its new home and the hope of a new chance and fresh start for a dying species - possibly ancient aliens, possibly future humanity... the jury's still out on that one. But to be completely honest, the whole thing feels like pretentious art w*nk of the highest order either way. It smacks of The Emperor's New Clothes to some degree and like there's so much vagueness to everything that anyone can project their own meaning to whatever they like and make it infinitely more profound than it would be were it merely explained to us in any degree of detail. If you have a worthy story then tell it! Let it be known and understood so people can enjoy it and share it. Don't hide it behind walls of damn near impenetrable symbolism and open-ended hints. Rather than coming across as mysterious it just ends up feeling like it lacks any real substance, and were it not for reading all the wild conspiracies, any faint trace of a story would have been completely lost on me as a result.\n\nWhat I did get was a series of unengaging puzzles in an array of strange environments where nothing seemed to make sense or have any reason. Some are simple switch-based affairs, others are more demanding and require some considered observation and noting, and none of them hit that sweet Goldilocks spot of being not too easy or not too hard. In fact, despite the generous, optional hint system, as time went on I found myself increasingly resenting their very existence in the game as they only seemed to hinder any sense of enjoyment or wonder at the spectacle of my surroundings. That's probably the one thing this does get right, as the stark, minimalist use of bold colour mixed with the challenging geometry of the architecture makes for a real marvel of design. But when that's the only real strength, it ultimately makes this feel like an interactive art installation more than a bona fide game.\n\nSo that's all you're really left with. When all you can do is walk, run and jump, with no actual option to manually interact with anything or make use of an inventory or even pick up any items, you just end up roaming around stepping on pressure pads or passing through beams of light until you're told you've completed the puzzle them move on to the next one. The game makes for some pretty pictures, but beyond that there's really nothing else I can recommend about it. In fact, while Steam tells me I spent 5 hours with this, it honestly felt like more than twice that, and I'm pretty sure that even counts all the Alt Tabbing I did as I needed to get away from the game's puzzles for a while. Whenever I was playing it I was thinking about other games I'd rather be experiencing instead, and when I wasn't playing it I dreaded the prospect of booting it up, eventually completing it only to get it over with so I'd never have to touch it or think about it again.\n\nThe only reason to have any interest in this game would be to go to its Store page, to scroll down, then to click on the list of similar (and no doubt far better) games in its genre then investigate those instead. Otherwise everything feels too much like art for art's sake and lacking in every other area. In short, avoid.","October 10, 2015","false","5.0"," 73 of 112 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","73","112","3","0"

Everything about this game seems like it's working towards something genuinely fun and interesting but it never came together for me.  The puzzles are a little too abstract (any puzzle where figuring out the goal of the puzzle is the actual puzzle isn't a great puzzle, and there are plenty of those), the graphics are almost cool but are a little too simple to hold my attention, and while the minimalistic soundtrack works for the game, it's by no means a draw to it.

The visuals are given sense by an excellent sound design, which kept me on edge for the duration of my playthrough; an achievement, considering the fundamentally abstract and calming nature of the setting. I didn't ever not feel like I was in an old, abandoned, alien place which might fall apart at any second, except when I finished the puzzle in the area and the whole place lighted up and started functioning again, but even then, the sense of foreboding was ever-present. Wide open areas get floaty synths that lurk just outside your hearing, punctuated by the slight  pat pat pat  of the character's walking, and inside areas each have a soundtrack that fits in well with what's around you. Going in blind, I half-expected the game to throw in some jumpscares at me at some point or another, but the actual gameplay was very deliberate and focused around the "narrative".\n\nThe game also shines in its visuals. You might be thinking, "Well, yeah, the game markets itself as a puzzle/exploration game, it's bound to have some nice environments", but some areas are unique enough to actually merit a "Holly ♥♥♥♥, this is amazing". This makes the actual gameplay suffer at times, though, as you're made to slowly walk up and down a ramp to press at buttons to try to figure the room's huge puzzle in an epic journey that was evidently designed to show off every possible angle of the room with no regards to how long it might take to get from one place to another.\n\nThe actual puzzles themselves, the main focus of the game, is where it's a bit lacking. For all the praise I might sing of its visuals and environments, it's a bit hard to justify some of the choices regarding their design. I found myself having to constantly check at the in-game hints and a guide I kept handy to figure out the worst of them. There's a special variety that I particularly loathed, which are the kind of puzzle that required you to move against a timer over pressure pads on the floor in a particular pattern, which was made very infuriating with the character's tendency to slide around as if the floor was iced over. I'd say this is the area of the game where it's at its weakest.\n\nI mentioned the game's narrative with quotation marks earlier on in this review, and that is because it's entirely possible to ignore it and never know anything about it, as it's never actually presented to you. It's just "there", and it doesn't care if you pick up on it or not. It's perfectly fine with sitting alone above the dusty door-frame of the room you just dismissed as pure eye candy and never having anything to do with you. It's not terribly complicated or unique, but it gives a sense to your running around, so I do recommend you take the time to trying to figure it out.\n\nShould you buy this game? If you can overlook that it's quite average as puzzle games go, and instead want to be awed by the amazing environments and architecture that it provides, sure, go for it. If not, you'll probably be wasting your money.\n\nI should also mention that it runs excellently in lower-end computers. So there's that.","March 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I haven't quite finished it yet, but I'm confident in recommending it. To be clear, if you're looking for a fast-paced game with all the latest bells and whistles, this is not the one for you. The graphics and music are quite simple, and gameplay is as slow-paced as you'd like it to be. However, I disagree with those who call this a "walking simulator." It is very much a game. There are puzzles to solve as well as a story to uncover.\n\nThe puzzles are very well-designed. There is no dialogue and no text, yet somehow it's always clear what you're expected to do. Some of the puzzles are quite simple, while others are much more complex, but I haven't found a single one I couldn't solve with a little patience and logical thought. It's not too easy, but it's not too difficult, either. There was only one puzzle I needed hints for - and those hints are provided in the game menu. There are three hints for each puzzle, starting out vague and growing more specific, so you can get exactly the amount of help you need if you ever get stuck.\n\nThe story is revealed entirely through gameplay. When I first started playing, I didn't expect there to be much of a story. I was satisfied with the beautiful abandoned abstract architecture and puzzles. The first time I uncovered an unexpected plot twist, my heart skipped a beat, and every one I've found after that has led to even more amazed moments. I'm very picky about storytelling, and this is one game that does it perfectly without ever resorting to dialogue or verbal exposition.\n\nOverall, it's a well-crafted game. Everything in it functions well and it all comes together to form a beautiful whole. It's not for everyone, but I think most people will find it enjoyable and well worth buying.","November 12, 2014","true","5.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I got this one in a bundle at some point and decided to play it today. I will say this...the game is incredibly difficult. There is a good chance you will wander without any idea what the hell you are doing and may quit as a result. That is actually a knock on this game. There is no such thing as obvious, with a couple exceptions. The game doesn't teach you anything really, and you are left to your own devices to sort out what you are supposed to do and the proper order in which to do so.\nSo....use a guide. This is one game where a guide is almost a necessity. You may be the sort of person who can figure out a game like this, but most people who play this wont finish it without the help of a guide. However, if you do, it doesn't detract from the experience at all, and the experience is really what this game is all about. For all that puzzles are the biggest challenge in this game, the sense of exploration and the different scenery is what makes this game stand out. I didnt get the sense of an overall story except:\n\nSPOILERS\n\nThat this is maybe a galactic museum of sorts, or a museum at the end of the world, or something like that, and the last curator died, after which it fell into disrepair. You are basically fixing it and getting it up and running again.\n\nSPOILER END\n\nSo, points off for not being very accessible at all, but points in its favor for being pretty unique and uniquely challenging. Pus, that secret ending was pretty funny when taking the rest of the game into consideration.\n\nAll in all, a 3 out of 10 for lack of accessibility and the (IMO) necessity of using a guide, but 8 out of 10 for everything else. Try it out. See what you think of it. I think it is a relevant game that will capture your imagination.","August 15, 2014","true","4.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","5"

This game is simplicity in action, and as I delved deeply into the carved blocks of granite/obsidian/stone/randomness to discern some hidden meaning behind it all, I found myself continually following my own line of thought, like a dog trailing after the scent of a long lost bone he buried somewhere deep in the earth.\n\nI honestly attempted to like this game, but sometimes a little concrete meaning is required after a jumble of meaningless gravel. What I mean is that Kairo is far too ambiguous; I can wander aimlessly through this game and decide what it means for myself until, quite literally, the very end, at which point Kairo finally decides to give me something solid - not okay, guys, not okay.\n\nKairo is a game that lets you wander through a child's block fort, occasionally posing *cough cough* "puzzles" that briefly halt your progress through the maze of nothingness. I felt as though the developers had a clear idea as to what they wanted to say, sat down in a conference room and said "Hey guys, woudn't it be really cool if we..." and then glued together a jumbled mess of a game.... Sorry, 'experience'. I received conflicting feelings of paranoia and comfort throughout the game, feeling at one time as though I were being watched and at another time as though I were revolting against an omnitient, though not omnipotent, regime, slowly tearing it down brick by ambiguous brick. I think each *cough cough* "puzzle" in this 'experience' was arbitrarily assigned some deeper 'meaning' after the story-board team smoked an acre of some illegal substance. That doesn't fly with me. I am certainly not saying I don't LOVE pushing my smug nose up and saying "Oh yesh, I am a very smart man and love interpreting games and books and movies because I am so deep and insightful" because I do love to say that. I am a smarmy head-up-my-ahem turd; Kairo is a jumbled mess of obfuscated meaning with an alternate ending (oh joy) to encourage further 'experiencing'. That's cheap, guys.\n\nIN BRIEF (he said ironically): Kairo is a block fort, glued together by a toddler hyped up on three gallons of coffee. Then a guy walked by and glued a tagline onto it that belongs at the bottom of an inspirational cat poster. If you have something to say, then say it. If you believe in what you're saying, then you want people to agree with you: make sure they know what you believe.\n\n10/10","March 29, 2015","false","4.9"," 60 of 100 people (60%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","60","60","100","20","2"

Cubist swamps, gravity-defying mechanisms, distant stone cities, and forests of infinite pillars await. Fog and limited draw distance are used to great effect here, shrouding impossibly huge structures from you until you move close enough for them to emerge from the murk. The environments are colorful and unique and seem to tell a story by their very nature. There's no text or dialogue in Kairo, but it has hints of the Dark Souls storytelling-without-telling motif.\n\nGameplay is about as simple as it gets. You walk, you run, you jump. There's no key for using, holding, or interacting here. Everything you need to fiddle with is done by proximity. This often manifests as pressure plates or stones to push, but there are more creative applications like devices that only activate when you stand in a certain orientation with them. The puzzles get hard too, so be prepared for some serious experimenting and creativity to work out how some of them function. There are some secrets to find as well, which require combing every nook and cranny of the dreamlike architecture... which is something you'll want to do anyway.\n\nThe big knock I have against Kairo is that, as well-done as the atmosphere and design is, it still looks like a Half-Life 1 mod. All the shapes lack detail and there are only a few basic textures used throughout. However, the game makes the most of its minimalist presentation, and in the end it could be seen as more of an asset than a drawback if you can immerse yourself in it.

It begins with some incredible ambient and atmospheric music which suggests a vast expanse of void filled with unidentifiable abstract buildings, shapes, devices, and questions. Kairo then fills that space with those exact objects and questions and asks the player to proceed with very little guidance or suggestion. I truly love when a designer gives their players an open world to explore with a suggested, yet vague, goal and then allows the player to explore that world in their own way in order to pursue that goal.\n\nKairo, in its most simple description, is a first-person, exploration, puzzle-platformer. Kairo, in a bit more detailed examination, is an ambient exploration of an alien landscape, filled with color and sound in which the player can lose themselves within the interaction, and wonder that the game offers. It's hard to detail exactly why I appreciate Kairo so much; it may be the unreal atmosphere and beautiful soundtrack, the open world exploration, the lack of handrails and guidance, the somewhat creepy atmosphere, the lush color and abstract landscapes, but I suspect that it's all of those things working in unison to create a wonderful and unique experience.\n\nHighest recommendations for those who enjoy first-person exploration games and puzzles.","March 29","true","4.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's a pretty game, but not pretty enough for a game whose merit at first glance is just that - being pretty. Numerous graphical glitches, the far-from-smooth movement and controls made for a miserable experience for me. It is very atmospheric I'll give it that, but apart from that the clunky movement, okay-ish design and graphics, and inconsistent puzzles really killed this game for me.\n\nAdded: Followed a guide to get the final achievements, now I realize why I found it not pretty at all for this kind of slow paced atmospheric game! The architecture is all really blocky, sharp edges throughout the whole game. Realized after completing the game why I got tired of it so fast.","March 11, 2014","false","4.1"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","26","43","0","0"

It's visuals are simple, but expertly crafted, both eerie and gorgeous at the same time. To say the least, the game is surreal in it's aesthetics. While the environment is some thing to take in, it's not just about looking at pretty set pieces, the game features mind bending puzzles as it's main motivator.\n\nThough the game is incredibly enjoyable, and wonderfully put together, it does have some minor flaws. The movements feel rather sluggish, and at best, floaty, and there isn't much incentive to replay the game once completed. Not to sound cliche, but Kairo really is about the journey and not the destination.\n\nFor $5.00 at it's full price, you are getting a quality product.

The art is very minimalist and surreal, very blocky in a braod sense, on purpose, and each screen or level is dominated by a color, which permeates everything in said level.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly "positioning" puzzles, in which you solve them by standing in a specific position or having to take certain path (but they are very logic and easy to understand), by having to push here and there some objects, just moving against them (there is no "action/manipulate" button), or by pressing some buttons in certain order. The atmosphere is mostly relaxing, but there are a few spooky or strange moments as well.\n\nThere is no rush, no sense of urgency, so you can stroll at your leisure through the many blocky landscapes. If you try to solve all puzzles by yourself, it could take about 6+ hours of game. If you follow a walkthrough, you could rush through it in a couple hours, but it would be a shame. There is also no manual save, but the game saves often as you reach a new area or solve some puzzle or find something noteworthy.\n\nThis game is ideal to relax or slow down a bit.

Yes please! Bonus points for having been made by the same man who did "The Binding of Isaac".\n\nKairo is what happens when Myst meets Mincraft and sprinkled with Shadow of the Colossus. The atmosphere is spooky, complemented by dissonant and etherial soundtrack, and punctuated by the sheer sense of scale and isolation. The machine, tower, and everything else is abandonned, and needs to be restarted. This requires you to solve a series of inventive, if no-nonsense puzzles in order to proceed.\n\nThe puzzles are somewhat challenging. I say this because the musical score alerts you when you're on the right track, or are doing something incorrectly. This can lead to simply listening to cues in order to proceed with the game.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game that hooks you for a bit and doesn't let go. Also: if anyone dares go near the stele at the apex of that exterior spiral staircase, let me know what happens.

I found the grain effect and mouse smoothing (default settings) annoying so I had to turn them off straight away. I had extremely choppy/laggy mouse and keyboard movement which might be due to my weak computer but this game should not as demanding on the cpu as it is. Despite all that Kairo's atmosphere is enjoyable and the much needed hint system helps in teaching you what the level design won't. Towards the later segments of the game the puzzles lose some of their quality and the map design will leave most players wondering around without much enjoyment.\n\nBottom LineIf you enjoy difficult puzzles and open ended mysteries Kairo will give you your money's worth\n\nFollow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/West7 for more game reviews","January 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Let me tell you why:\n(Caution: minor spoilers ahead)\n\nFirst of all I expected a little more story. Sadly there is absolutely none. Before playing it I also thought that there's maybe a connection to the city Cairo in Egypt, but there is no connection at all (as far as I experienced it). The only "clues" you get in the game are some blurry pictures and unrecognizable audio tunes which serves no purpose. A deeper meaning? I doubt it. And for an art-project this seems all too random and poorly conceived. When I finished the game I was as smart as before. Mostly I didn't even know, what I was doing and for what purpose. Who build these puzzles and why? And why do I have to solve them? But that's my second point of criticism: the riddles.\n\nThe riddles are sometimes too simple, and sometimes you don't have a clue what you should be doing and the game doesn't give you any hints regarding the puzzle. Some of these riddles I solved by pure luck, bashing buttons and trying it over and over again. Even after I finished some of these, I couldn't tell you how I solved it. But most of the riddles based just on pushing the right button at the right time. Not much fun and also not very clever for a puzzle game...\nAnd there are also rooms without any importance to the main riddle, but you can't recognize, which rooms are important and which are just "corridors" to other rooms. There is no clear path in this game. Some may call this "concept" or "open world", but I think the developers just had not enough time (or talent) to generate a clear guideline for the player. And that is my third point of criticism: the level design.\n\nAll you do in this game is walk. And walk. And walk. After playing it a few hours, I constatly use the "sprint"-key, just to get where I want to, faster. Because every room is enormous and vast. At first this is actually cool, but after a few riddles it is just annoying. Yeah, I understand - big landscapes: cool! But the levels don't include too many details and it's getting boring. concrete wall on concrete wall. So here's my final point of criticism: the look of the game.\n\nSure, this is not a AAA-game by some major game developer, but the game looks like it's from 1995. The rooms and places look too clean and dull, there's no life or fun in these corridors and halls. So the walking gets very frustrating, because you walk through dull rooms all the time, solving very easy (or "what-the-hell-do-I-have-to-do") puzzles without even knowing what purpose for... And the end screen (which appears very soon) gives you no solution what you just accomplished.\nOne good thing in Kairo is the soundtrack. It is deep and athmospheric and it prevents the game to get even more boring.\n\nSo all in all I was disappointed. The game was indeed too short (6 hours), but because I got sick of running around in circles I was happy when the end screen appeared.\nThe game would surely be better, if there actually was a story or maybe even a connection to the city of Cairo. I could even imagine a game about the political / social struggle in Egypt and the history and the culture of Cairo. Unfortunate, Kairo had potental, but the poor game design and the absence of story just killed the whole game.","January 27, 2015","false","5.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Kario could still be complex and grand without the stairs, paths, and extra large rooms. The only thing which drove me to continue was my stubbornness to complete the game.\n","September 9, 2014","false","2.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

This game, to me, perfects the feeling of loneliness (related spoilers in brackets below)\nThis feeling of loneliness was so present and so overwhelming to me, and I kept moving on wondering what was next. As time went on and things started being revealed to me, the things which were revealed only made that feeling of loneliness grow. There were some points at which I also felt fear, the sort of fear you feel when you want to get out of a room and you don't know quite why, so you run out and slam the door behind you.\nThe game itself is pretty solid. You have no inventory and no buttons with which you can use to interact with things. You walk jump and look around and those are the only controls. The variety of puzzles despite this is amazing, and most of them make perfect sense (there was one where you rotate two gears to match symbols in some weird arbitrary manner and I never actually figured out what the connection was. Had to use a guide for that part)\nIf I didn't have the emotional capacity of a potato I would have cried at the end, I swear to god, it just HIT ME RIGHT THERE, RIGHT IN THE WEAK POINT. So please please PLEASE BUY THIS GAME.\n\n[there's a moment in the game where you walk into a room and press a button. TV screens turn on around you, showing a humanlike figure behind static. As you solve the puzzles around this point in the game, this figure pops up on more TV screens as you complete puzzles. As I played through I thought to myself, "Is that another human? If I meet them what will happen? Who are they?" At some point you find yourself in a green tinted room with another TV, only larger and in front of a table. When you walk around the table, you find a skeleton on a chair with monitors examining puzzles you've completed in front of it. There is a message scratched onto the arm of the chair.

It is great how it can give you so much with so bare materials. Anything else would spoil.\n\nIn the end of the game you can see a dedication: “For everyone who ever needed a second chance”, floating in a grassy field with a blue sunny sky and a luxuriant tree. This forced me to think twice about the game. What does it have to do with second chances? Then I got it. It is about moving from a lifeless machine to a garden with flowing life. So, it is really about coming back to life. A second chance to live. It’s amazing how this message is there without the need of any word.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkyde/recommended/233230/","dkyde","[404] Dkyde | The Scatman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dkyde/","667 products in account","If the words minimalistic abstraction ever had to be used to describe a game, then Kairo, developed by British Richard Perrin, would be the most appropriate game. I originally purchased and installed the game without quite knowing what to expect – or what not to expect for that matter. Kairo starts in  medias res; something which naturally leaves the player with a fair amount of uncertainty and second-guesses as to what they are meant to do. Unlike most other games however, the uncertainty gradually increases as you progress through the first few stages of the game – a very unusual, yet intriguing, experience. Unfortunately this also represents the barrier where players either decide to delve into this unique and captivating piece of content, or quit. It is important to stress that Kairo is not like any other game – and it may even be discussed whether labelling as it as puzzle exploration rather than game is more appropriate.\n\nThe fact that Kairo manages to distance itself from most other games within the first few minutes of gameplay is an accomplishment alone though, and perhaps the word distinct is a keyword when it comes to describing the game as a whole. There is no tutorial, no introduction to the story and no explanation to why you find yourself on top of an ancient stone construction. Alone.\n\nThe exploration begins psychedelically as you wander into thin air in an adventurous attempt to make it to the next construction. It is evident that exploration indeed is a big part of Kairo – both to complete the individual rooms, but also to locate the correct path(s). It moreover turns out that mastering scrutinizing for close to every sub-dimensional room is crucial and highly rewarding as players will find hidden runes and unlock achievements for collecting these.\n\nAs more rooms are unlocked and more puzzles are solved, the player starts to wonder what the purpose of Kairo is, not to mention what Kairo itself is –  if anything at all. It is evident that the player is reactivating – and sometimes literally fixing – ancient mechanisms within the ruins. At times short glimpses of modern- and present-times are shown, which yet again questions the story. Is Kairo a new beginning, or is it a desperate attempt to fix what has been lost and destroyed – or something completely else?\n\nKairo is not a game for everyone, and it is a game which requires determination and a genuine interest in solving brainteasing puzzles. The environment and story (or, rather, lack of story given your point of view) can be very appealing, but that alone is not a reason to purchase and enjoy the game. A strong interest in puzzles is essential, but if a genuine interest is present then Kairo does offer some extremely complex, unique and intriguing puzzles which, without a guide, easily can take longer than eight hours to complete. Kairo is thus strongly recommendable for those seeking a unique and brainteasing puzzler with an interesting plot, but should be avoided by those who prefer more traditional puzzle-games.\n\nRead my full review here: http://212fahrenheit.reviews/?p=67.","August 3, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It walks a bit of a line between games like Antichamber, Myst and Fez, where the environment is all you have to direct you through the puzzles and the world. While the visuals and puzzles are interesting, I don't think they match up to the standard of those three titles. There are a few great ones scattered and some secret content hidden throughout, bringing a game that is overall pretty fulfilling for a puzzle gamer. The later optional puzzles in particular are really quite difficult and I was unable to complete most of them without external help, speaking as somebody who completed Antichamber and all but two puzzles in Fez without needing to do so.\n\nThe sound and visuals work well together to build a nice atmosphere; the screenshots on the steam store speak for themselves. The mystery in the game starts to build up quite nicely as the game goes on, although I felt left wanting more of a final payoff.\n\nA decent title for 4 hours or so, but only worth getting if you have already played and enjoyed both Antichamber and Fez, as I would say they are better games with similar audiences.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orangestar1/recommended/233230/","Orangestar1","Orangestar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orangestar1/","121 products in account","NOTE: Somehow, the most recent updates to the game have made it incredibly buggy. In the stable release the main menu stays onscreen the entire time and I can't look left or right. In the DK2 Beta things are much more polished, but there are some sequencing glitches where I can reach the Garden without having completed a single puzzle. It's still worth a try if you can get it to work.\n\nKairo is not exactly the most complex game, but it gives you enough mental stimulation. Since it's only $6 right now, either go ahead and get it or wait for a sale. If you're on the fence about this one, I encourage you to read on fully.\n\nFIRST OFFKairo is made in Unity, and if you've experienced a game in Unity you know that slowdowns are extremely common. Prepare to wade through the settings several times deciding what slows you down and what doesn't, maximizing appearance with playability, especially when most defaults are selected with high-speed computers in mind.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe puzzles in Kairo are particularly easy by minimalistic adventure standards, but the developers have definitely squared down exactly what kind of puzzles they need. Rather than blatantly giving you instructions or commentary to push you in the right direction, they require you to work out exactly what's going on to figure out the solution, very similar to Myst. Puzzles are isolated to their own special room, but sadly this means most of the time you'll be walking through a room that's more for sightseeing than for puzzlesolving. For the casual gamer, Kairo features a hint system that can assist in solving puzzles. There's no penalty, and it doesn't resolve if they're used or not. All in all, Kairo is a solid puzzle game.\n\nVISUALSThe minimalistic visuals of Kairo are absolutely breathtaking. The wonderfully crafted levels are absolutely gorgeous to look at, and unlike many games, the additions of things like film grain only serve to add to the visuals, rather than give a false impression of visuals. Of particular note are areas of the game where the film grain is programmatically increased to add effect as you look around and wander. There is (as it first seems) only one texture that Kairo has: a concrete/stone texture kind of thing. This sort of forces you to look at the architecture as the art. And boy, is the architecture ever art. Stunning and functional, the deliberate monochrome of Kairo's architecture make it one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played.\n\nSTORY...Well, here's where the negatives come up. Kairo's story is one that you have to infer, but the structure of the gameplay kind of causes whatever the story would possibly be to get... jumbled. I'm not sure how to describe this without giving much away, but Andrew Plotkin has a wonderful quote that hits this nail right on the head.\n\n"If I were to level a charge, it would be that the game world never really coheres, beyond the visual level. An adventure can set up its narrative drive through discovered texts and journals (old gag though that is). Or it can build a narrative out of its artistic details, the discovered connections and implications hidden in the visual world. Or this structure can come from the gameplay itself -- the connections you discover between the puzzles and mechanisms that make up the game. By solving, you learn what it's for.\n\nKairo disavows each of these strategies: it chooses minimalist artwork, (nearly) textless presentation, and modular puzzles. They're separate design decisions, but together they more or less rule out the sense of a coherent narrative world. It's not a flaw in the game, but a missed opportunity, I guess."\n~Andrew Plotkin[gameshelf.jmac.org]\n\nTHE SECRETThere are a set number of secrets to the game, but Jesus Christ do NOT even try going for that ♥♥♥♥. Just look up a walkthrough. Kairo's secret ending (yes, it does exist) is a joke. I have to give that away. It's not really funny, and the solution to get to it is completely obscure to get to. It was painful to read how people figured out how to get to the secret rooms, they reminded me of classic Sierra game solutions, it was that bad. Not to mention the secret ending in the dev room (after I even managed to get to it) made me question the validity of all the other secret rooms regarding any sort of story Kairo has. My verdict? Kairo has no story, and that's the worst thing I could possibly say for this genre of games. I'm all for a game with no story (DOOM is one of my favorite games, for God's sake!) but that's a philosophy that needs to be considered on a game-per-game basis, and Kairo's the kind of game that can't handle that ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOVERALLKairo's a game that promises too much at the start of the game and delivers too little at BOTH of it's endings. However, if you're more here to solve some puzzles and get beautiful visuals, then by all means, $6 isn't all that much. Go ahead and grab it if you're into art games, or if it's on sale. You'll get more out of this than Dear Esther in terms of fun. (imo)\n\nOh, also check out Antichamber if you're all for atmospheric avant-garde first-person puzzle games with no true plot! THAT'S how to do that ♥♥♥♥ right.","March 12, 2015","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/233230/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nKairo is a game of exploration and mystery, putting a whole world of differently coloured rooms ahead of you, each with its own intrigues and puzzles; the design of those rooms is simplistic, each following a precise theme and colour, without adding too much detail on the ambient, but that's part of what makes Kairo's mystery so great, leaving you with questions about a certain object that you encountered and what useful information that object might have for you. While some of those questions will be answered by the end of the game, most of them won't, leaving you more confused than you were when you first started the game, and as great as that is from the mysterious perspective of the game, it somehow feels disappointing at the same time, as you probably were expecting at least some of the bigger mysteries to be answered in a way or another, but on the bright side that leaves a lot of room for interpretation, allowing each one of us to have our own verdict on what Kairo wanted to tell us. The greatest part about this game however, is the way it manages to shape its universe around you, constantly surprising you with what lies ahead in the next room and leaving you in doubt on how you should react to what you see before your eyes, but at the same time giving you complete freedom to move around and see what you can discover to help you solve that room's puzzle and move forward just to have the same thing happen to you all over again. In the end, judging by the amount of hours you've spent in Kairo it won't add up to more than a few hours, but really digging into the experience and enjoying the mysteries it has to tell, it will seem a lot longer while you're inside and exploring at will, even though for most times, the more you explore, the more unanswered questions you'll have at the end.\nRating: 7.5\n\nGameplay\nEvery once in a while, you run into those type of games that offer a unique and thrilling experience without focusing too much on the gameplay, but rather on the experience you have by simply being a part of that game and uncovering its mysteries; Kairo is exactly that type of game, delivering a simplistic mechanic of navigating through its universe and clever ways to solve its puzzles by using nothing else besides the basic movements and the environment around you. This game is all about exploration and uncovering the numerous mysteries that lie ahead, using the things you've seen before and the things you see in that very moment to help you solve different puzzles that stand in the way of your progression, something that works wonderful in Kairo, following a logical way of seeing things and even though the solution might not be that obvious at first, exploring the environment around you will eventually give you the information you need. Most areas follow the same pattern, requiring you to enter all the side rooms, observe what you can do in there and get things moving again until each and every one of the required steps has been completed and the core of that area is up and running, allowing you to move forward on to the next one. By putting some of the information you need to unlock various secrets in the rooms ahead of you, Kairo requires you to return to previously visited areas without feeling repetitive or boring, as there will always be something new to uncover that you might have missed on your first visit, and with the information from the rooms ahead of you in mind, you will for most of the times, know what you're looking for already. Even with the usage of the movements keys only, some of the mechanics such as pushing objects around feel like they haven't reached their full potential, as such simple things could've expanded the way in which puzzles are treated in various ways, making the game longer and adding that extra gameplay portion that's missing.\n\nGraphics\nIt's hard not to appreciate the unique art style of Kairo and the wonderful and sometimes spooky environments it delivers, but even in all the simplicity of shapes and precise objects you can clearly see the outdated engine on which the game was built. There are an almost infinite number of ways in which this game could have been improved by using the latest game engines, especially in the lighting area, where the latest engines would've made a huge difference on how that room is viewed and the exact experience the game wanted to deliver.\nRating: 5.5\n\nAudio\nThere's always a great tune playing in the background to add to the feel of a certain room, sometimes adding to the feeling of joy and liberty, while other times cornering you in a small room with little light and a spooky theme to add to the mystery effect. The sound effects as low quality as they are do their job well enough, but there was room for a little more variety and a few more touches here and there to make you hear the world moving around you when it does visually happen on the screen.\nRating: 7\n\nExtras\nIt takes around four hours to complete Kairo, add an extra hour or two if you're looking to get the most out of it and collect all the glyphs, monoliths and solve all the secret puzzles, but also note that this is a game priced at 3.99€, so for that amount of money, it does more than enough to please. With the amount of mystery and out of place objects you can find in this game there was room for a lot more, as some of the areas are not used to their fullest and areas that seem to have some sort of puzzle attached to them at first, are just there to give the impression of having more to see.\nRating: 9\n\nVerdict\nKairo isn't much of a game, but it's one great experience, especially if you're into the abstract puzzle genre, as its unique design and way of saying things make it a must play for any enthusiast of the genre. As in most cases, there was room for more in some areas and modern graphics would've made a huge difference in the way the game unveils to you, but considering the fact that this is an indie game, it did a great job delivering a worthy experience from a low budget production.\nRating Overall: 7.4\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Kairo at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=279[/h1]","September 11, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unless you are willing to make a degree of meaning for the game for yourself, interpret some of it as art, or spend some time unraveling the abstract references and hidden meaning, you'll probably have a boring time with an average 3D exploration puzzle game. But for those who spend some time unraveling those clues, thinking about those references, and connecting the abstract together, there are interesting layers of story and meaning.\n\nHighlightsAs stated above, the main problems people have with Kairo, and the thing most people praise about Kairo stem from the same issue; the lack of direct or game-fed meaning, story and explanation. If you invest the time, Kairo becomes something much more, but it's always going to be subtle. For some, spending the time soaking in environment simply isn't worth the mild reward, and there are other games which do a much better job, and for others it will act as casual slow-paced art. In short, it's probably a game you'll either love or hate.\n\n* Extremely subtle designs in everything from lighting, shapes, distances and more add to the concept or image being conveyed in each section\n* Particularly good on VR platforms, mainly the Oculus Rift, though there are problems here\n\nMistakesMany people have a problem with Kairo, or don't see any value in it against other games in its genre. In the end, it comes down to whether traditional gameplay elements and story are required to make this game fun for you or whether light and often frustrating-to-figure-out puzzles are enough reason for you to explore a strange environment.\n\n* The first sections have clearly been structured to convey tutorial elements while remaining non-obvious and ambiguous, but the problem many people have with this game is its lack of story, explanation or meaning and while that's not necessarily a mistake, it's subjective, and worth bearing in mind\n* The difficulty and nature of puzzles is erratic, which is understandable, but it would've benefited the game to make, at least some puzzle elementst more fluid and understandable\n* The bobby weaving motions when moving help add a subtle dreamlike feel, but may induce motion sickness or mild nausea and should've at least been given adjustable options\n\nRecommendationsAt just £3.99/4.99€/$4.99, Kairo is fairly priced and clocks in at 3-4 hours play time. Due to the mysterious or ambiguous nature of Kairo, some may find themselves spending much, much longer on this title, exploring the secrets or potential elements of meaning, whereas others will move on after an hour or less. Either way, it's definitely worth a buy for anyone looking for something with a different approach, and shouldn't be missed when on sale.\n\n* There are some fantastic player interpretations of the story elements and reading them in itself is fun The Secret of Kairo[www.electrondance.com]\n* A headset is recommended as it make the experience stronger, a VR headset is even better\n* Kairo (回路) is the Japanese word for "circuit" which lends to elements of the story\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/233230","June 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

While they start out easy, later in the game, they are really counter intuitive(At least the devs had the idea of including hints).\nI was stuck on the last "world", not even because I was stuck on a puzzle, but I simply didn't knew what puzzle was left to do.\nNot to mention the optional puzzles that lead to the secret ending(which is just stupid and feel more like a filler than rewarding) are even harder and are simply undo-able without a guide. Also, they require backtracking.\n\nThe graphics are both basic and good, and the game run very well on low end computers(Even with shaders on). Though the environments are sometimes too lazy and blocky. The ambient music is also great, and give a mood to each "room".\n\nThe "story"... Okay, I just don't get it. Kairo use a lot of morbid symbols, post-apocalyptic pictures, etc, but it never feel more than an assemblage of tropes("Oh, look how creepy is this place! So creppy, huh???") rather than a mysterious story. So don't buy this game for the story.\n\nIn short, if you are okay with using a guide/the hints for the puzzles, then you could buy it.","April 28, 2014","false","5.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Thought provoking and simple with some really challenging puzzles. Definitely recommended if that sounds appealing to you.\n\nOne minor criticism: The work associated with the achievement 'A Problem Shared' is probably a bit too much to ask of players buying a single player offline game. It requires you to look outside the game for assistance, yet the game never flags this internally or sets a precedent of this occuring in any other puzzle. I genuinely don't understand how players are epxected to know this and I think it makes for a weak puzzle in the end. This is a lot of text to describe something minor easily resolved with a search though.

I absolutely love "artsy" games like this. However, there were several problems that tainted the experience for me.\n\nPuzzles - They are counter-intuitive. While some puzzles make sense and are easy to figure out, others don't. For example, the puzzle at the back of the light house where you step on certain blocks seemed entirely random.\n\nMovement, view, and mouse control - The extremely smooth movement in combination with narrow point of view made me feel sick to my stomach within 10 minutes. The lag between when I moved my mouse in comparison to when the character moved certainly didn't help, but that may have just been caused by my machine.\n\nBroken pause menu - Again, this may have just been my machine, but during the pause menu, there was no way to select any options. I could only exit the pause menu by hitting escape. When I wanted to quit the game, I had to alt-tab and force close it. Being able to access the options may have been able to fix my previous complaint.\n\nEmpty textures - Textures and objects seemed empty and incomplete. I know that is the art style this game is going for, but it still seems very unpolished.\n\nSound - In games like this, sound effects and music need to take advantage of the atmosphere. I found most of the sound effects were cheesy and took away from the experience. For example, the cheap MIDI gong sound whenever you made progress in a puzzle is just awful. A lot of the time, there was too much silence, or just unvarying static, that could have benefited greatly with ambient music. During the few moments that ambient music was present, it seemed immaturely written and distracting.\n\nI think that covers about everything I found poorly done in this game. Luckily, I bought it on sale and obtained a foil card so I have already made my money back. I really do want to enjoy this game and am disappointed that I didn't, since it seems like an interesting idea and I liked the lonely atmosphere. I will try it again if/when there is ever an update to see if any of these issues were fixed.","March 1, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Both prominently feature first-person exploration of vast, compelling brutalist architecture, monochromatic visuals (frequently, but not always greyscale), a profound sense of isolation, a deliberately ambiguous plot and practically-undefined protagonist, as well as an overarching dreamlike quality to the entire experience.\nWhere NaissanceE is primarily exploration and platforming with some occasional light puzzle-solving, Kairo is primarily exploration and puzzle-solving with some occasional light platforming.\nMost of Kairo's puzzles are thoughtful and reveal their answers with observation and consideration.  There were certainly a few that were much less complicated than I made them out to be, some that felt like simple trial and error, but a couple were obscure enough that I eventually resorted to searching out the answer.  (Ugh, the wheels of shapes!)  Fortunately, you're usually given a few puzzles at a time to work on in whatever order you choose.  There are also some extra-credit puzzles that unlock the super-secret ending that lays bare the true meaning of the bizarre mechanisms you set in motion throughout the game.\nWhile NaissanceE has a handful of video-game and pop-culture references, Kairo isn't afraid to give a nod and a wink to other games.\nSteam says I've got about 5 hours into Kairo, and I feel like I was able to explore the gameworld pretty thorougly in that time.  Since I got it on sale for less than $1.50, I'd say that was easily worth the price of admission.","December 7, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game does not beat around the bush in trying to add other things alongside the puzzles.   It is very much focused on puzzles that force a person to really think, or to be patient and wait til an answer appears.    The game can be frustrating because often times, you will come across a puzzle in which doing things in the wrong order, will lead to various issues, or puzzles where an answer is not possible to find until a later time.    I knw that it was annoying trying to figure out a few of the puzzles, and eventually used a hint guide to figure it out.\n\n\n\nGraphics:   Very basic graphics, low res textures and stuff.   But like I said before, this game focuses on the puzzle aspect, not the pretty visuals.   Also, there are a nice color theme that can be seen so that is enjoyable.\n\n\nAudio:   Very minimal muisc because it focuses on the puzzle, not the other things.\n\nGame Mechnics:    The controls are very simple.  You move, you jump, you run.   Nothing more, nothing less.   You solve puzzles by moving in certain areas, moving objects to certain areas, and standing in certain places.\n\n\nStory:   None that I could see, but thats possibly due to it focusing on the puzzles, rather than the story.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable  game that can be frustrating at times, due to the challenging aspect of it, but since there is a 100% guide on Steam, you will always have a way to make it through IF, key word is if, you need it.   If you are not that good with puzzles or logical thinking, then I would not recommend this because it will easily frustate you.","December 11, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend it in all its lukewarm glory.\n\nIt's a puzzle-game with platforming elements - unlike its contemporaries Kairo gives you a full range of movement that helps avoid the monotony of more "walking simulator"-esque games, though it rarely expects you to actually platform. There's something to be said for bunnyhopping your way through the environment, and there's even some collectables that take advantage of the movement system.\n\nKairo ran well enough, though I did have some minor troubles getting stuck on the geometry and consistently had clipping issues with the camera edges while running it at a 1920x1080 resolution, which I don't particularly hold against the game.\n\nIt bills itself as an exploration game, but the progression is still largely straightforward - you travel from hub to hub solving puzzles in siderooms accessible via portals. Your exploration is largely limited to the next area the game wants you to go. I didn't think this was a negative aspect in the slightest, as I've personally no interest in wandering around some landscape with no idea where to go, but unless you figure exploration to mean "looking at the game as you progress through it" then it does stand out.\n\nThe puzzles are simple and easy to figure out, rarely requiring more than a few minutes of experimentation to figure out each ones internal logic structure (outside of one frustratingly weird gear puzzle that I'm still not sure how I managed to solve). You're never outright told what to do, but given your simple moveset and means of interaction - mostly pushing blocks or activating buttons - it's not hard to figure out, though there's a hint system anyway. If you've ever played a puzzle game before, you'll just be going through the motions.\n\nThroughout the game, there's a consistent rate of highly unique rooms to traverse as you solve the puzzles presented. These rooms are sadly marred by their low budget - the massive structures are simplistic, and empty, mostly relying on the novelty of the colour schemes and their sheer vastness to hold your attention. Given the short amount of time you spend in each area, it works, though if/when you backtrack to pick up collectables you've missed and solve optional puzzles you'll the novelty wears off.\n\nStory is there, but it's completely ambiguous, mostly symbolic and only really lends itself to the game through some notable imagery. It's not really worth "figuring out", I didn't bother with it and I doubt it's meant to be a part of the "experience", but the flavour it lends to the puzzles is appreciated nonetheless.\n\nThe advantages of Kairo lie in how casual a game it is. It's a game to wind down with, cool off and a have a cup of joe while adjusting to the game's own wavelength. It was obviously a labour of love, but there's not much more to the game than that. There's nothing wrong with that. There's just nothing memorable about it either.","December 2, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It partially succeeds, but is definitely not up to the standard of games from other series.\nThe environments are fairy well done, and the static-y atmospheric effects make them feel appropriately ominous.  The trouble is, all these spooky monuments and inscrutable features seem mostly just thrown together.  I rarely got any sort of sense as to what they were supposed to have been.  The single biggest thing contributing to the lack of connection to the locations (aside from how sterile they all are) is the fact that all the doors connecting areas are teleporters.  You step through one and you're in an environment that looks nothing like the one you left; could be on the other side of the planet for all you know.  Most of these are just connecting corridors, with no purpose but to create a buffer between puzzle rooms.\nNearly all the puzzles themselves were quite simple and solved quickly, save one which was very obtuse.  Some of them are supposed to be reactivating dormant machinery (except that the stuff is so abstract you have no idea what it's supposed to do), while others feel like puzzles for the sake of puzzles.\nYou can breeze through the main sections in just a few hours.  Once you do, there are a couple of tougher puzzles that require hunting around for the proper code.  There's also this scavenger hunt thing where you try to find all the hidden glyphs around the rooms.  Neither feels all that interesting to me, since you're just going back over areas you've already visited and solved with a fine-tooth comb.","August 27, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What they talk about on the site is: after we dump a bunch of nuclear waste somewhere and seal it off, how do we signal to future generations that they should stay away? Given that the half-life of the waste in question is 10,000 years, about as long as recorded history, this poses a significant problem: how do we communicate with people who will likely be nothing like us, and have a very limited understanding of our language, society and history; how do we tell them that they should not hang out in or excavate this nuclear waste dump? The expert judgers come up with a series of sculptural and architectural edifices, things that imply danger and will last millennia, and each one is more bizarre, desolate and brutal than the last.\n\nA lot of what I see and do in Kairo feels like I'm interacting with someone's answer to that kind of question (although not about nuclear waste, specifically), which is extremely cool.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the puzzles are very good. Gameplay is mostly about observation, testing interactions and figuring out how things work. It's kind of like Riven in that regard, and so far I haven't run up against any versions of classically lazy puzzles. Which is to say: no sliding tile puzzles, no finding the bauble and sticking it into the mcdooly, no one-on/one-off puzzles where you try to get everything to sync up as on or off. The first step of every puzzle is figuring out its rules and its pieces, and then trying to understand what the end goal is. It's all very seamless, very understated, and very rewarding.\n\nHighest recommendation.","June 20, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Kairo is every bit as fun and eerie as you would want a 3D puzzle game to be.  Do yourself a favor and play this game alone and uninterrupted for a full immersive feel.  There are no verbal cues - as in you will never have another character speak to you, and you will never hear your own character talk.  There aren't any written cues or instructions beyond symbols you find (and of course the gentle hints in your menu screen, should you need them).  It's all about using the landscape and the machines and puzzles to your advantage - to a visual person like me, this was a wonderful experience.  Each different area in the game has its own color scheme and chosen background music and sounds from one of the game's tracks (the music is great for the game and ranges from "Fairly soothing and enlightening", to "I feel like someone just shoved ice down the back of my shirt").  In terms of graphics, it's not exactly, say, "Skyrim" in terms of detail or texture - but that honestly works well for the game.  The maker of this game knew what he was doing and while it's a little rough around the edges in some regards (I guess) the game is -solid- in the graphics department to me.  It feels like the great machines are actually working next to you.  That you're standing next to sources of great power, or that you're standing next to a row of...  Well you'll see (I really do love the architecture in some parts).  I completed the main storyline and some of the extra content without any help, but admit that I did need some help from the Steam Community to unlock the rest (there is one particular "bonus" puzzle that actually demands that you seek outside help in order to solve it).  Lastly I want to talk about the storyline - There is a lump that forms in the pit of your stomach once you start realizing where this game is going and the gravity of what has already happened and the gravity of what you might actually be doing.  It was mentioned already, but once you're done with the game (as it contains heavy spoilers), check out "The Secret of Kairo" on Electron Dance's blog if you want to read into some good theories behind the game.","February 22, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The puzzles lack depth, complexity, and do not require deep thinking in order to discover the solution. They feel like an afterthought and I think the developer intentionally designed them so to make the experience in Kairo more fluid.\n\nAs you may have read, Kairo is a minimalist exploration game (though it's more of an abstract art gallery simulator). Meaning you can only walk, run, and jump. Your interaction with machines is restricted thus partially explaining the lack of depth in some of the puzzles. No in game button prompts. Nothing out of the Kairo's context distracts you, save the notification that informs you've solved a puzzle. It's all for the purpose of pulling you deep into Kairo's world full of abstract architecture and objects with strange behavior that apparently defies physics. The fine grain filter and errie soundtrack assist in attempting to build an absorbing atmosphere.\n\nExcept I felt a disconnect for some reason. None of the abstract architectures (nor the atmosphere) evoked any feelings. No texts located anywhere to provide some backstory. Perhaps (and I'm not sure) some story could be deciphered (or interpreted) but the game gave me no reason or motivation to invest the effort into it. Even during the conclusion when Kairo's purpose was hinted at, no tingle of emotion.\n\nIn my opinion, you can approach this game like you approach a strange dream right after waking up, either invest the energy to interpret it and derive personal meaning or instantly forget about all the vague disjointed images. If you're the former or if the idea of an abstract art gallery simulator sounds appealing, then maybe Kairo might be for you.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for something with cohesion and a game that gradually unfolds a story with clarity (or a challenging puzzler as talked about in first paragraph) then I would defintely pass this one up.","March 26, 2015","false","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I wouldn't even say it was a game for most people.  It's the type of game that takes a lot of patience to enjoy.  You've got to really put yourself into the game, imagine that you're really in this place, seeing these things.  The atmosphere and mystery are everything, and if that isn't your bag then you won't find enough to enjoy here when it comes to pure gameplay.\n\nThere are indeed puzzles to be solved, but most of them are quite simple.  There are no controls beyond moving around and jumping, and there's no text or story to speak of beyond what you're observing of your environment.  As is to be expected with these types of games, a lot of it is open for interpretation, including the ending.  The graphics are solid, but quite simple and low-budget; most of the architecture is made up of blocks and flat planes.\n\nIf any of those things are deal-breakers, then don't even bother.  But if you're into the pure sense of discovery that games can offer then I can't possibly recommend it enough.  The term gets tossed around a lot, but it truly is more of an experience than a game.  You've got to like abstraction, simplicity, and rich atmosphere (thanks in large part to the excellent sound design).  You've got to be the type of person who gets a thrill from the simple act of booting up a game and not knowing exactly what to expect--of heading through a door and not having the foggiest idea of what you'll see.\n\nThere isn't much more to say about the game.  If it's not your cup of tea, nothing else here will be relevant to you.  If it is, then there's no need for me to explain what was great about it with more detail, because it's already obvious that you should play it.  I mean hey, it's five bucks, and as I type this it's on sale for one whole dollar.  Even if the story only lasts a few hours, that's a stupidly good deal for such an experience.","December 1, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Imagine LSD: Dream Emulator but texturally subdued and transformed into a relatively linear puzzle game, with just a dash of the Assassin's Creed 2 glyph sequences for flavor.\n\nThe graphics and designs of the game are unimpressive, but not uninentionally so.  The minimalism of both the visuals and the music create a complexly desolate atmosphere, and, like LSD, the emptiness of the world never comes off as a result of laziness but of tasteful restraint.  It's easy to fill a puzzle game with distracting elements that intrude on the experience as a whole, but it's refreshing to see one that makes an enjoyable experience using only movement controls and basic graphics.\n\nIn the vein of games like Fract OSC, Antichamber, The Devil's Tuning Fork, and Against the Wall, this is a game that does not hold the player's hand at any point and does not even provide any form of communication or instruction to the player until the ending, allowing for total uninterrupted exploration, and the game is intuitive enough to keep going at a steady pace regardless.  This makes sense in an internal way, as well, as the game is set in a long abandoned universe in which the player is a complete stranger.\n\nThe ending is a bit cheesy and the sequences that reveal the world's story are unoriginal at best.  I was also unimpressed by the various photographs and videos that attempted to connect Kairo to Earth, which appear incessantly throughout the game just incase the message wasn't received the first few times.  In a puzzle game that involves some amount of thought in order to progress, this felt patronizing and undermined the feeling that the game developer trusts the player to make the connections themselves.  The alien and deserted tone of the game was also diminished by this forced message, which left me wishing that the game had remained mysterious and totally detached from the real world like it initially appeared.  It seems as if the game was created first, but in the later stages of development the developer decided to tack a deeper story onto the game, conflicting with the original vision for the project.\n\nBland connotations aside, I didn't expect to spend nine hours in this game, and it says something about Kairo that I can spend a day backtracking through every area multiple times in order to unlock the achievements and the secret ending and still have fond memories of the experience (even if the secret ending was a massive disappointment).\n\nUltimately, I would recommend this game if you want something that has a poweful and moving atmosphere, but if you're just looking for a puzzle game then look elsewhere, as the puzzles here aren't as memorable as the overarching experience.","March 22","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It takes me right back to "Driller" or its sequel "Far Side" which, used "Freescape", an early 3D, to evoke alien and unusual environments.   Unlike those two early games, Kairo gives no backstory, and lets you attempt to figure it out for yourself. I love it...\n\nThe whole game is extremely minimalist in its level design, but extremely evocative of space and alienness.  The aesthetics are a mix of old and new:  blocky, simplistic but with texture mapping, reflections, fog, flames and more.  The overly simplistic design may deter some who would dismiss the game as dated, but anything more complex would start to get in the way of the narrative.\n\nIt may not have been the designer's "point", but the simplicity of the environment allows you to completely ignore it, and focus more on playing the game.  And playing may not be the best definition either:  experience, discover, enjoy are also great definitions for this.\n\nThe beginning makes it look like you'll be exploring ancient egyptian ruins (albeit in a dreamy world of whiteness), before  abruptly turning grey and industrial-feeling.  The game continues to take turns and each area feels and plays a lot different.\n\nThe only time that the simplicity works against the game is when an area is more complex than it looks. After traversing a dozen empty corridors, and passing stray cubes, you may not realise that another grey unmarked stray cube is, in fact, a trigger for some action, and be left puzzling for a while.  Such "difficulty through obscurity" is a hard one to balance right, to be honest, so I'll let it off, mostly.\n\nI think the thing I enjoy most about Kairo is that it really plays with our preconceptions of what a 3d puzzle game is.  They jokingly call one of their achievements "Locked Door Puzzle" as a nod to other more mainstream games.\n\nI really enjoyed playing Kairo, and then with the help of a cheat to find all the secrets.. A great minimal game.  If you do decide to play it, don't try and speed-run it.  although it looks shallow and simplistic, there are a lot of hidden (or just obscure) tidbits for the explorer.\n","October 5, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It takes me right back to "Driller" or its sequel "Far Side" which, used "Freescape", an early 3D, to evoke alien and unusual environments.   Unlike those two early games, Kairo gives no backstory, and lets you attempt to figure it out for yourself. I love it...\n\nThe whole game is extremely minimalist in its level design, but extremely evocative of space and alienness.  The aesthetics are a mix of old and new:  blocky, simplistic but with texture mapping, reflections, fog, flames and more.  The overly simplistic design may deter some who would dismiss the game as dated, but anything more complex would start to get in the way of the narrative.\n\nIt may not have been the designer's "point", but the simplicity of the environment allows you to completely ignore it, and focus more on playing the game.  And playing may not be the best definition either:  experience, discover, enjoy are also great definitions for this.\n\nThe beginning makes it look like you'll be exploring ancient egyptian ruins (albeit in a dreamy world of whiteness), before  abruptly turning grey and industrial-feeling.  The game continues to take turns and each area feels and plays a lot different.\n\nThe only time that the simplicity works against the game is when an area is more complex than it looks. After traversing a dozen empty corridors, and passing stray cubes, you may not realise that another grey unmarked stray cube is, in fact, a trigger for some action, and be left puzzling for a while.  Such "difficulty through obscurity" is a hard one to balance right, to be honest, so I'll let it off, mostly.\n\nI think the thing I enjoy most about Kairo is that it really plays with our preconceptions of what a 3d puzzle game is.  They jokingly call one of their achievements "Locked Door Puzzle" as a nod to other more mainstream games.\n\nI really enjoyed playing Kairo, and then with the help of a cheat to find all the secrets.. A great minimal game.  If you do decide to play it, don't try and speed-run it.  although it looks shallow and simplistic, there are a lot of hidden (or just obscure) tidbits for the explorer.\n","October 5, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can't say, I never actually DID anything.

You havce no idea who or where you are, or even what's happening. Pushing a button on the wall causes a chime to go off and suddenly blocks of "water" are flowing up a cliff...\n\nWelcome to every second of gameplay in Kairo, a first-person puzzle game somewhat akin to the "closed-room" Flash games you got so furious at as a child. There is no menu to speak of. No dialogue. No explanations. If you want to degrade yourself by using the "hints" provided, then you might have some idea of what needs to happen. Otherwise? Well...maybe if you hop backwards on one leg the door will open.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the puzzles in Kairo are great! They twist and bend your mind in ways that few activities do. Sadly, this is somewhat diminished by the monotonous tone of walking through nothingness hitting the Escape key for your next clue. It looks like someone wanted to make a game of random puzzles, but felt the need to incorporate a storyline. This is fine, of course, unless you refuse to use any words at all - written or spoken. As the player, you end up with a small hint as to anything that did happen/will happen/is happening....then the game ends. Congratulations! You've solved 3 hours worth of puzzle game!\n\nAll-in-all, it was a good bit of fun. I bought it for $1.50, so it's hard to complain.

However, I only got an hour into this game and was completely bored by it.\n\nThe graphics look like they were made in the mid-90s; things like the original Unreal had higher poly counts than this does, and more graphical cohesion. Just about everything is done with blocks and the textures, in-as-much as they are even used, seem to be just tossed on to objects as almost an after-thought. Even "water" is just a bunch of disconnected rectangles. Rooms have seemingly random color selections, with almost everything being very monotone (a violet room, a red room, a grey room, etc.) There is no way to know if the fog means you'll fall, or you can walk on it (like the intro area). In fact, there's no way to know if a block is meant to be walked on or not except to try and see if you go through it or not.\n\nGameplay is very simplistic. You can move, move faster (run) and jump and that is all of the controls. They have the option to do this all with the mouse, but since the game doesn't bind the mouse cursor, this doesn't work well with my 3 monitor set up since I jump out of the game the next time I click to start walking after turning around.\n\nLike everything else, the puzzles are very minimalistic. The ones I could find were very easy to solve. However, several of them you cannot even tell if they are puzzles or not... or even what you should be doing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=672171036\nFor example, in one (red) room in the second area, there are a bunch of pedestals that make sounds. If you look up, you see stars above them that have lines drawn on them from the last 4 pedestals... and no indication of what you should do. It has a triangle in the middle that is aligned and shaped without matching the stars, so there is no indication which of the many triangle shapes you should be making, or if that is even the correct thing to do. I spent probably 20 minutes making various triangles in that room, to no avail.\n\nIn another area, there were what looked like a lot of pods that had screens on them. Most of the screens had static, but one showed a low-res version of what you were seeing, and a couple others showed something else. The significance of this place was totally lost on me.\n\nAlso hidden in the game are tiny symbol things you can collect for... no known reason at all. They seem to largely be hidden in various rooms, so trying to collect those turns into the "look very closely at every wall from every angle" sort of thing... it was getting tedious.\n\nThe "world" is also very minimal. It is just a bunch of separate "rooms" with portals connecting them. There is no real plot to be found, no idea why any of this exists, who you are supposed to be, or what the point is to "solving" the puzzles. It felt pointless, and not really rewarding for solving anything.","April 24","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I really found myself enjoying this game. What Kairo lacks in graphical fidelity it makes up in sound design. The soundtrack meshes with the stark and rigidly geometric envirnment to convey a sense of place and meaning. The "story" of the game is very much open to interpretation but I thought it was poignant and dramatic. Pushing through the games puzzles - which, admittedly, at times were a little needlessly opaque - nevertheless gave me a real sense of purpose. It's wonderful that a game like this can be created through crowdfunding, and deliver such a hefty emotional punch despite such a small budget.","September 30, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I couldn't figure out what the game was trying to convey, or even find my own meaning in it, and there was no closure. It just felt empty. There were no "ah ha!" moments, just "oh, ok. That's cool I guess."\n\nThe puzzles themselves ranged from trivial to extremely difficult. Don't get me started on the random "puzzle" that makes you press a button until something randomly happens after multiple tries... I was constantly at a loss of where to go/what to do I often had to resort to a playthrough.\n\nThis is just my experience with the game, your milegage may vary.

The various positive reviews and an endorsement from RPS also seemed to indicate that this was a diamond in the rough. However as it turned out, it is actually a mouldy chunk of food in the dust. How on earth this game achieved anywhere near a positive status on Steam I have no idea, but I suspect foul play. Allow me to explain why you need to avoid Kairo like the plague.\n\nPlain textures can sometimes be compensated for by some impressively detailed architecture or environments which hold intrigue. Kairo simply does not have any of that. The environments look like they were made by someone experimenting with mapping and decided to package everything together to make it seem like a game. The designer has some strange idea that throwing tons of fog into every section of the game is a substitute for creating atmospheric lighting or using the environment itself to influence the players' state of mind. As such every part of the game I saw felt lifeless, unfinished and bland. I have honestly seen maps from the original Quake with more atmosphere, style and imagination.\n\nThe 'puzzles' are so dull that I literally gave up after playing the game for half an hour. They consist of running into invisible triggers or standing on trigger brushes to cause something to happen. One of the things the designer forgot to actually do is clearly indicate when a puzzle is solved and what the point of solving it was. In one area I found 4 platforms which turned on a bunch of particle effects on a rotating central disc. Visually quite interesting and clearly the puzzle was solved because all of the triggers stopped working, but it did not appear to have any effect upon the game. The lack of direction here is astounding as the designer chooses to leave you completely in the dark as to what you should be doing and gives no context or sense of progress to what you manage to figure out on your own. Someone needs to sit this person down with games like Myst, the Longest Journey, Master Reboot or even The Room so they can understand the difference between an enjoyable mystery and aimless activity.\n\nKairo is unpleasant to look at, boring to explore, devoid of any sense of achievement or purpose and ultimately one of the worst games I have had the misfortune to mistake for a worthwhile investment of money or time.","November 29, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What you're left with is a bunch of unengaging puzzles which are only worthy of changing the pace between other gameplay elements, of which there are none now. Such puzzles consist of stepping on floor buttons in the correct order, shown on a wall in front of you. Levels are extremely low-poly and have single featureless texture tiled over most surfaces. Monochromatic environments, while making up for an appealing screenshot gallery, can be really nauseating.\n\nIn order to have a minimalist aesthetic appeal Kairo strives for, it would have to do all those small things right, like making footstep sounds actually match your walking speed, or not having them at all. Instead, its one of those games where you feel like you're stuck crouching constantly so you hit the crouch button to untoggle it, but the camera drops even lower.\n\n","July 10, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

It feels unfinished. And the blinding white sky and strange visual appearance kind of give me a headache. The game doesn't teach well at all, so you feel unsure of what you should be doing.

I hate to write a negative review, but this game is just not well put together or polished. The levels don't have a consistent feel or visual style, the architecture is not believable, navigation is difficult and the player just needs a LOT more direction.\n\nIf the game was linear, taught skills incrementally, was more intuitive, rewarded the player, had save points, and was easier to navigate it could be a really fun game.

It's not clever, it's not intuitive, it's just very, very marginally "artsy", so everyone will be drawn into what is otherwise a shallow and uninteresting experience.\n\nThe Rant Begins\n\nI've had my eye on this game for a very long time, and I'd been intentionally avoiding the reviews to the best of my ability, because I felt as though this was the sort of game you wouldn't want to spoil by having any prior knowledge of any aspect of it.  The reviews looked positive, and that was the important part, in my eyes.  Naturally, once it finally went on sale I wasn't the least bit hesitant to snatch it up and install it as quickly as could be, because games like this (I thought.) always fascinate me and never fail to entertain.\n\nI love the "off-kilter" genre, and I don't at all mind when a game wants to sit down and just walk me through a story.  Visceral Clean-up Detail, Dear Esther, Tiny & Big, Gone Home, these are games I've played more than once, or a dozen times over, just because I love it when a studio or an individual sits down and tries to defy a genre, because if no one ever did, we'd end up with a terribly stagnant market practically bereft of originality.\n\nI've also never been one to shy away from a solidly-constructed puzzle game.  Portal needs no introduction, Braid--although overhyped--made you plan ahead so far that it occasionally became a little brain-bending. The Bridge, Antichamber, Myst, Kill the Bad Guy, FEZ, all of these came at the puzzle genre with something unique, and often very atmospheric.  They made you rack your brain to see a puzzle in a light it had never quite been presented in before, and you would walk away feeling accomplished when you'd finally figured out that one, little trick to cinching it all together.\n\nKairo does none of these things.  It attempts to paint a unique world full of mystery that begs to be explored, but in those rare instances where it rewards exploration, you get such a small, nonsensical snippet of the 'lore' that you're just left with more questions, or a flimsy little "piece" of the puzzle in the form of a slight JPG-artifacted "rune".  Often times Kairo will have entire rooms, entire cement-slathered, sprawling 'scapes to explore that serve absolutely no purpose at all.\n\nKairo also does not approach the puzzle genre in any meaningful way.  I know this is a matter of contention, because there are those that think the puzzles are just blatantly impossible, and then those that insist Kairo is brilliant because it does offer some semblances of clues in the form of pattern recognition, or subtle sound cues, but both of these trains of thought are ultimately flawed, because Kairo, to me, suffers from a cardinal sin when you examine its puzzles more closely:  Kairo's puzzles are boring.\n\nOnce you've managed to work out exactly what it is that the game is expecting of you, you don't have one of those, "Oh God, really?!" moments that you'd have in Portal, you don't see all the little nuanced motions that you'll need to pull off to navigate through the level in The Bridge; in Kairo, once you've seen the puzzle for what it is, it is always something excruciatingly simple.  Many of these puzzles--far too many of them--simply involve a trial-and-error style rote memorization of a keypad-like button press sequence.  One of them involves shuffling yourself into the right place until all the blocks line up with the other blocks.  I hope you enjoy this one, because you'll be doing it a lot.\n\nOne of the "core" puzzles for the secret ending involves scouring this desolate, barren expanse of cement into every nook and cranny, until you find all 15 of the JPG artifacts, and the worst one of all?  Backtracking.  The last of the core puzzles involves a nearly-nonsensical amount of backtracking to accomplish.  Yes, you are given a very mild hint concerning what to do and where to go, but the fact of the matter is the game is shoving you ten to fifteen minutes out of your way, through uninteresting environments you've already seen, to do virtually nothing except headbutt a statue.\n\nClearly this is a game that's garnered an impressive following, and I've no doubt that there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this sort of game for what it is, but I came into this expecting a refreshingly-interesting story at best, a unique puzzle in the very least, and at the worst: An interesting world I could explore.  I found myself being offered none of these things.\n\nIn short:  In Kairo, I do not feel alone.  I feel bored[/i].","December 31, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I really tried.\n\nBut i can't. It really just comes down to the fact that even as an "explore and wonderment" game, it's very...dull. The atmosphere is great and a lot of the areas (Especially the famous "red pylon" room) are fantastic looking, but...The puzzles feel bland and useless, like they were taked on to give the game uneeded "difficulty" (of which there is none even with puzzles), the music can be grating at times, and some of the stuff, like the static, screens, or door effects, feel a bit out of place.\n\nI can definitely respect what the game was trying to do, and in terms of being a "wow look at this giant otherworldly thing" game it succeeds, but i think that adding ridiculously easy puzzles and the sort actually took away from the game rather than added to it. If the whole game was just walking through progressively grander rooms (with the occasional ACTUAL jumping puzzle, the only puzzle that i think could fit in this game), i'd like it a lot more, but it just was a bit too tedious for me.","January 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The trailer for the game made it appear tantalizing and intriguing and, most of all, fun.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't take me twenty minutes to regret this small purchase.\n\nKairo has, I've found, missed the mark on one of the most fundamental gaming concepts; not just in video games, but in the entire realm of playing a game for fun. I call this "carrot-and-stick". Other people call this other things. But essentially, in nearly every game you can think of, there's the metaphorical carrot, your objective, and the metaphorical stick, what keeps you from your objective. I could cite endless games, card games, board games, arcade games, games of make-believe played in the backyard of my friends' houses when we were five, and, yes, video games that keep/kept me latched onto the idea, entertained, and engaged in the gameplay.\n\nOne thing I quickly learned in Kairo is that there's not much of a carrot.\n\nI'm going to take this discussion back to Antichamber, for those who have played it. I'd hypothesize that the two are compared often for the similar concept of working through puzzles in complete solitude. But in the Hub of Antichamber, you can see a door marked Exit, though you cannot reach it. In one of the first spawn points, you can see a door behind a barrier marked "The End". There's even the Black Ghost, dancing just out of your reach on certain puzzles. These are all suitable carrots.\n\nKairo is designed in such a way that I have yet to see the carrot; there's not much more than an endless stick. And after almost an hour and a half of playing for no apparent reason, I tired of the game.\n\nOn one last note, for all the endless puzzles in Kairo, there are worlds you walk through that have no puzzles at all. The game has a hint feature, but if you are not so inclined to use it, it's incredibly difficult to discern a puzzle world from a world that's apparently there for your exhaustive visual pleasure.","December 15, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Not very much though, this game made me bored faster than a math lesson can do.\n\n\nPositives:\n\n- Decent scripting I guess\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Pretty much everything\n- Boring gameplay\n- No storyline\n\n\nYou spawn in a world with absoutely no clue how you got there. You don't have a name, you don't have a goal, you don't have anything to find. The story is non existing.\n\nSome games can be good even without a clear goal or a background story, but not in this case.\n\nNot only do you have no goal, enemies or purpose in Kairo whatsoever, the puzzles are also simple but yet confusing. You can not interact with anything and you don't have an inventory, meaning that all you can do is move objects by walking towards them, or jump on random platforms in hope that something will happen. Really, really simple puzzles. And when I say it's also confusing, what I mean is, you don't really know why you are doing what you are doing due to the non existing story and the few hints you get doesn't really help that much at all.\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? No. I don't recommend it to anyone.\n\nPeople that love adventures, no. The game is as simple as it can be (including the soundtracks and gameplay in general) with nothing to explore or discover at all. You don't even have a purpose or anything to lose. Not even health (no, you can't even die in this game).\n\nPeople that like puzzle games, no. Again, the puzzles are basic, yet confusing, and you don't really know why you are doing them.\n\nPeople that love a good storyline, no. There is no story in this game at all.\n\n-------------------\n\nWhy people like this is beyond me.

All in all, I want to get immersed into the game but the lack of polish and sluggish controls make it impossible to do so.\n\nUntil this game is properly polished I can't recommend it.\n\nIf the dev wants help with mapping, I would be willing to help if I can, for a small fee of course.","November 10, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The gameplay is simple yet challenging, and the built-in hint system is helpful enough to point you in the right direction when you're stuck without outright spoiling the puzzle.  However, I think the abstract design makes the story hard to follow (and leaves the player to guess); after finishing the game, I wasn't really sure what it was all about.  Still, that doesn't detract from the gameplay.  If you enjoy puzzle games and want something a little different, I would definitely recommend Kairo.\n\nPros:\n- Otherworldly/alien environment.\n- Engaging, abstract, and unique puzzles.\n- Good music, which helps set a somewhat ominous and somber tone.\n\nCons:\n- The story was a little *too* abstract.\n- Keyboard controls are not remappable, or even listed in full.  For example, the "R" key resets you to the room entrance, but I found that completely by accident.\n- There is no way to see your progress on collecting the hidden glyphs, except by collecting more of the glyphs.

So I would NOT do that, were I to live life a second time.\n\nThis game has a few REALLY killer puzzles, and I am a snob about puzzles, so that is saying something.  I think the number one thing that made this game work is it's utter abstractness.  Many of the best puzzles were fairly simple tasks, but understanding how the mechanisms worked was a challending and engaging task, simply because of the lack of context.\n\nOne of the most interesting and unique things about this game is the cool control scheme in which the position where you are standing affects the state of the world.  This is used in a variety of ways, and it somehow manages to make very simple puzzles a lot more engaging.\n\nOn the down side, this game was definitely lacking in polish.  Movement was slightly glitchy - especially going up stairs and jumping off walls (which I'm not sure you were supposed to be able to do at all).  There were often cheap looking cracks between blocks that didn't quite touch.  Some icons looked like poorly clipped .pngs.  Just a little rough around the edges.\n\nAlso the "story" kept getting devastatingly interesting, and then leaving you hanging.  Ending was super weird (secret ending was even weirder.

It's rather minimalist in that 99% of the time there is zero HUD, and there are no "use" keys. The only way to interact with the world is, much like Proteus, by just being. Standing on switches and pads, moving against things, and walking around so that objects react to your very position relative to them will solve most of the puzzles in this game.\n\nKairo's puzzles are mostly (if not all) logical. They are, however, of the type where you will often walk into a room, have literally no idea of how the room works, leave, come back later, and solve it immediately upon walking back in. So goes Kairo. If you're ever completely and absolutely stumped, there are hints provided by the in-game menu (which unfold in a UHS-style increasingly-specific manner), though it should rarely come to that.\n\nThere is a story to Kairo. I am no fan of the obtuse "insert your own ending/meaning/plot here" plots that have become so commonplace in indie games these days, and I was initially under the impression that Kairo had followed suit. But I was embarrassingly wrong. There is, underneath it all, a highly interesting story that Kairo tells. It is told over the course of the game, and the elements which make it up stare you in the face wherever you go - though you do have to put the puzzle pieces together, yourself. While I myself had noticed all of these elements and even picked up on a hint or two of where they were leading me, I completely glazed over most of it and didn't connect anything that cried out for connection.\n\nDo try not to make my mistake.\n\nThere are many interesting elements at work, here. It is in the interest of receiving the best experience that you can, for you to not only solve the puzzles, but to also pay attention to the world around you, and draw as many conclusions as possible along the way.","June 19, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DDSUS/recommended/233230/","DDSUS","Carry Me Senpai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DDSUS/","74 products in account","I personally love games that are about exploration and  open to interpretation. When I found Kairo and read that it advertised both aspects within its experience, I was instantly bought.\n\nKairo doesn't offer much in explanation. Every where you go is pretty much bathed in a single chromatic color with plain textures adorning every strange shape of your enviroment. This strangeness is accentuated even more with its plain droning music that is more akin to white noise. There is no death in Kairo either. There is no way to fail in Kairo. In Kairo it is just you, your mind and Kairo.\n\nNow, what exactly is Kairo and why are you there? To understand these things you must venture into your new world. Kairo is seperated into hubs, within in those hubs are different rooms that contain a puzzle. Solve the puzzles and move on to the next hub until you reach the end. That's your goal. The puzzles themselves are not the most complicated thing to accomplish, pull a switch, push a block, align a grid ect and if you ever find yourself stuck there are also helpful hints in the options!\n\nOther than getting to the end there are a few other things to accomplish as detailed by the achievements. Scattered throughout Kairo are 18 runes to collect, a few beacons to activate and a couple of tricky secrety puzzles to solve. I personally feel that if you are invested even in the slightist for Kairo's world then these extra goals should be mandatory for players to solve. The reward in narritive and overall experience trumps the extra hour or two one puts in to accomplish these goals. A helpful tip/warning though, always make sure you collect all the glyphs in an area before moving on! Backtracking for glyphs can be a pain in the ♥♥♥! And if you must backtrack wait until the last hub!\n\nOverall Kairo is a very very short game. This is a good thing though as with such games you will find yourself thinking more about the world as apposed to the gameplay. Kairo is very good food for your brain and whether it's on sale or for the normal five dollars trust me if you like exploration and mystery this is a fantastic deal.","November 27, 2013","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is all rectangles and circles and simple geometric shapes.  The music exists simply to generate atmosphere.  There is no "plot," but rather a series of puzzles that are to be completed simply because they exist.  The puzzles are generally fairly easy, although there are no real instructions and most of the puzzles require you to use your surroundings to figure out what to do.  In addition the "secret" puzzles are a pretty big step up in difficulty and will likely resort to the user having to consult a guide.\n\nAll of that said, the game succeeds with what it's trying to do.  The atmosphere is engrossing and engaging and the game is neither too easy or too difficult.  It's really a shame it was only 3-4 hours long, 'cause I think it could have been twice as long and not worn out its welcome.\n\nRating: 8/10","May 25, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kairo is something that demands your full attention. It is a game that you play in the dark, all alone. You won't be killing zombies or assassinating kings in Kairo, but you will be exploring a strange, impossible world filled with perplexing architecture.\n\nThe ambiance is unsettling, and even threatening at times. The music (written by Wounds) is alienating and absolutely beautiful. The graphics are simple, but this simplicity fits in perfectly in making you feel that you are truly in a foreign world; a place you do not understand. For those of us with low end computers, you'll find this to be a pleasantly smooth running game.\n\nAt its core Kairo is a puzzle game. Some puzzles are easy and won't strain you too badly, but others are so hard it's almost unrealistic to think any player could solve them on their own (looking at you, Clock Room). Each puzzle is intuitive though, and they always make sense after you solve them (even you, Clock Room).\nLuckily if you get hopelessly stuck, each puzzle has three hints and the solution to help you along.\n\nThe story is what really ties the elements of Kairo together. From the start you'll have many questions: Where am I? Why am I here? WHO am I? Will these questions be answered? Well, that depends on you. There is little to no dialogue in Kairo. The story is expressed entirely through the environment and the things that you see. If you want to understand this place you're in, then you must actively think about the actions you take, and how they're affecting the world around you. There are answers to your questions, but Kairo leaves it entirely up to you to find them. If you take the time to uncover the mystery, you'll be glad that you did.\n\nKairo is a game that not everyone will love. But for those who do, it is a masterpiece. It is the kind of game that sticks with you long after you finish it. I wholeheartedly recommend Kairo.","September 28, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/recommended/233230/","pogobeta","Pogo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogobeta/","467 products in account","Kairo is a game about exploration and puzzle solving. If Myst had been made in this generation, I think Kairo is a pretty good representation of what it would play like (though Kairo chose a much more abstract blocky appearance in many areas).\n\nOne of the really cool things about this game is that there is really no dependence on language. There are no conversations and no written or spoken instructions or clues in-game. Aside from the menu and the credits, you don't even need to be literate. The only "reading" deals with symbol-matching and it's in the context of numbers, not words.\n\nI jumped right into Kairo without researching it at all, and honestly that's what I'd recommend everybody do. Seriously, if it sounds at all like something you might like, stop reading and jump in without any more context.\n\n\n\nI will, however, continue typing for those who prefer to keep reading.\n\nThe game is all first-person exploration. Just move and jump. There is no combat, there is no inventory, there is no picking-up-and-carrying-and-putting-down of items. All your interaction is in where you walk, what you stand on, and what you bump into or push.\n\nThere are three major areas, referred to as the Lighthouse, the Tower, and the Garden. Each area contains hubs with several adjoining puzzle rooms. Complete puzzle rooms around a hub to unlock additional puzzle rooms and advance to the next area.\n\nThere's no substantial danger. If you fall, the game is pretty generous about spawning you quickly and very near, so you don't really risk losing progress.\n\nWhile I do recommend this game overall, I do have a couple of warnings:\n-There are little rune symbols scattered around the world. Most of them are in areas that are easy to get to but that you just wouldn't see unless you were specifically seeking them out. They're not required in order to finish the game, but you might find yourself backtracking if you decide to look for them all. There is one false rune in a hub room. I don't know if this was a mistake but you just can't get that one, and it's not accounted for in the "list" of found runes.\n\n-There is a faint grainy overlay filter on pretty much everything, and combined with the occasional (and sometimes kinda loud) radio static noise, I started to get a headache after a while. If you play with headphones on, keep your volume comfortably low.\n\n-There are three rooms that don't have an obvious purpose. Checking the hints for these rooms won't help, as the hints suggest that the rooms are there just for fun. All three of them are basically different kinds of geometric combination locks, so it's possible to brute-force the solutions, but there are so many possibilities that it's really not a reasonable method. One requires an audio clue from elsewhere in the game, one requires an extremely well-hidden visual clue from elsewhere in the game, and one actually requires collaboration with other people who have played (or are playing). There is sort of a code, and each player only gets one of the four parts of the code, so you would ideally need to exchange clues with at least 3 other people who got a different part of the solution. This is actually a cool concept, but since the whole game presents this atmosphere of isolation, the notion of communicating with other people out-of-game to trade codes is really counterintuitive. Then again, maybe it's a puzzle to try to find 3+ other people who would rather exchange guesses than just web search for the solution (which, admittedly, is how I reached the solution).","August 30, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No combat, the controls are a bit floaty at times and there is no real "challenge" as the puzzles are, with a bit of thinking, relatively easy to solve.

Kairo.\n\nFor every step you take in this lonely world, you find yourself seemingly stuck and lost within yourself as well. Film grain covers your field of vision as you navigate the towers, solving a wide plethora of puzzles, from simple navigation of a simple maze to interpreting a star map just to open a door to running on treadmills, Kairo does the puzzle genre justice by infusing complex and mind-boggling puzzles towards a simplistic, minimalist world. The colours are beautiful, the gameplay is relatively solid (although I personally find the movement a little too sensitive) and this is really immersive by itself (if you play in a dark room with headphones).\n\nA drawback for me personally was that I found myself getting lost most of the time, that I was unable to have a good view of the puzzle I'm trying to solve. Like a rat in a maze, I could not see the big picture of the puzzle and I had to keep walking in circles trying to figure out what I've done, even resorting to sketching out some rooms on a piece of paper and drawing the various interactive elements on the paper so I can figure out what in the world is going on. It does interrupt the flow of the game for me sometimes and it was a little distracting to the overall feel of the game.\n\nIn short, despite the few rough edges of this work of art, Kairo is really a beautiful gameset (with its fair share of really, really creepy elements and depictions here and there), really meant for the casual player to play and enjoy this surreal world, while unraveling a terrible tale that led to this place. If you're a puzzle nut and you enjoy creepy, lonely worlds, Kairo really is the place for you to be.\n\nEurogamer has succiently highlighted the deep spine of Kairo. "Kairo is mysterious and elegant and powerfully distinct. Like Fez and Minecraft, it will work your way into your dreams if you're not careful."\n\nPlay at your own risk, because Kairo does leave impressions in your mind as you play it, with the wide rooms and chilling images (when you stumble upon some seemingly "dead ends") and huge, huge glyphs.\n\nTo this casual gamer's opinion:\nKairo: 7.5/10","May 8, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kairo.\n\nFor every step you take in this lonely world, you find yourself seemingly stuck and lost within yourself as well. Film grain covers your field of vision as you navigate the towers, solving a wide plethora of puzzles, from simple navigation of a simple maze to interpreting a star map just to open a door to running on treadmills, Kairo does the puzzle genre justice by infusing complex and mind-boggling puzzles towards a simplistic, minimalist world. The colours are beautiful, the gameplay is relatively solid (although I personally find the movement a little too sensitive) and this is really immersive by itself (if you play in a dark room with headphones).\n\nA drawback for me personally was that I found myself getting lost most of the time, that I was unable to have a good view of the puzzle I'm trying to solve. Like a rat in a maze, I could not see the big picture of the puzzle and I had to keep walking in circles trying to figure out what I've done, even resorting to sketching out some rooms on a piece of paper and drawing the various interactive elements on the paper so I can figure out what in the world is going on. It does interrupt the flow of the game for me sometimes and it was a little distracting to the overall feel of the game.\n\nIn short, despite the few rough edges of this work of art, Kairo is really a beautiful gameset (with its fair share of really, really creepy elements and depictions here and there), really meant for the casual player to play and enjoy this surreal world, while unraveling a terrible tale that led to this place. If you're a puzzle nut and you enjoy creepy, lonely worlds, Kairo really is the place for you to be.\n\nEurogamer has succiently highlighted the deep spine of Kairo. "Kairo is mysterious and elegant and powerfully distinct. Like Fez and Minecraft, it will work your way into your dreams if you're not careful."\n\nPlay at your own risk, because Kairo does leave impressions in your mind as you play it, with the wide rooms and chilling images (when you stumble upon some seemingly "dead ends") and huge, huge glyphs.\n\nTo this casual gamer's opinion:\nKairo: 7.5/10","May 8, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is all rectangles and circles and simple geometric shapes.  The music exists simply to generate atmosphere.  There is no "plot," but rather a series of puzzles that are to be completed simply because they exist.  The puzzles are generally fairly easy, although there are no real instructions and most of the puzzles require you to use your surroundings to figure out what to do.  In addition the "secret" puzzles are a pretty big step up in difficulty and will likely resort to the user having to consult a guide.\n\nAll of that said, the game succeeds with what it's trying to do.  The atmosphere is engrossing and engaging and the game is neither too easy or too difficult.

The trailer above kinda oversells the graphics — they're not minimalistic, they're cheap.\nThat being said, everything else about Kairo is great.\n\nDistant cousin of Myst, this game is comprised mostly of puzzles. And there is a compelling diversity in these: some are very easy, some are very difficult; some totally straightforward, some mind-bendingly abstract; and of course everything in between. This makes the progression always enticing and never boring.\nThe level design is very cool despite the poor graphics and each level has its own unique feel, the whole game being very "atmospheric". This is brilliantly reinforced by the marvelous sound design, with a really, really awesome music that transported me from puzzle to puzzle in a dream-like state.\n\nThanks to all these strenghts, Kairo manages to be at the same time fun and relaxing. It is a journey, really, in a land full of mysteries and secrets, where lots of questions are raised and no explanations given — you make your own conclusions from the scarce clues given along the path.\n\nI have no idea how to grade it out of ten, but I am positive that I'd recommend it in a heartbeat to pretty much anyone. The only major flaw that I would point out is the absence of V-Sync which allows some MASSIVE tearing to occur. And the Field of View is rendered in layers, which looks kinda awful. But other than that, well... What's not to like?\n\nYou like puzzles? Get it. Like "moody" games? It's a good one. Like quality OSTs? This one's perfect. You like Myst?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/233230/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Kairo is an interesting sort of first-person adventure game. It's rather minimalist in that 99% of the time there is zero HUD, and there are no "use" keys. The only way to interact with the world is, much like Proteus, by just being. Standing on switches and pads, moving against things, and walking around so that objects react to your very position relative to them will solve most of the puzzles in this game.\n\nKairo's puzzles are mostly (if not all) logical. They are, however, of the type where you will often walk into a room, have literally no idea of how the room works, leave, come back later, and solve it immediately upon walking back in. So goes Kairo. If you're ever completely and absolutely stumped, there are hints provided by the in-game menu (which unfold in a UHS-style increasingly-specific manner), though it should rarely come to that.\n\nThere is a story to Kairo. I am no fan of the obtuse "insert your own ending/meaning/plot here" plots that have become so commonplace in indie games these days, and I was initially under the impression that Kairo had followed suit. But I was embarrassingly wrong. There is, underneath it all, a highly interesting story that Kairo tells. It is told over the course of the game, and the elements which make it up stare you in the face wherever you go - though you do have to put the puzzle pieces together, yourself. While I myself had noticed all of these elements and even picked up on a hint or two of where they were leading me, I completely glazed over most of it and didn't connect anything that cried out for connection.\n\nDo try not to make my mistake.\n\nThere are many interesting elements at work, here. It is in the interest of receiving the best experience that you can, for you to not only solve the puzzles, but to also pay attention to the world around you, and draw as many conclusions as possible along the way.","June 19, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DDSUS/recommended/233230/","DDSUS","Carry Me Senpai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DDSUS/","74 products in account","I personally love games that are about exploration and  open to interpretation. When I found Kairo and read that it advertised both aspects within its experience, I was instantly bought.\n\nKairo doesn't offer much in explanation. Every where you go is pretty much bathed in a single chromatic color with plain textures adorning every strange shape of your enviroment. This strangeness is accentuated even more with its plain droning music that is more akin to white noise. There is no death in Kairo either. There is no way to fail in Kairo. In Kairo it is just you, your mind and Kairo.\n\nNow, what exactly is Kairo and why are you there? To understand these things you must venture into your new world. Kairo is seperated into hubs, within in those hubs are different rooms that contain a puzzle. Solve the puzzles and move on to the next hub until you reach the end. That's your goal. The puzzles themselves are not the most complicated thing to accomplish, pull a switch, push a block, align a grid ect and if you ever find yourself stuck there are also helpful hints in the options!\n\nOther than getting to the end there are a few other things to accomplish as detailed by the achievements. Scattered throughout Kairo are 18 runes to collect, a few beacons to activate and a couple of tricky secrety puzzles to solve. I personally feel that if you are invested even in the slightist for Kairo's world then these extra goals should be mandatory for players to solve. The reward in narritive and overall experience trumps the extra hour or two one puts in to accomplish these goals. A helpful tip/warning though, always make sure you collect all the glyphs in an area before moving on! Backtracking for glyphs can be a pain in the ♥♥♥! And if you must backtrack wait until the last hub!\n\nOverall Kairo is a very very short game.

Not unlike the early forms of dadaism, this is one of the only games (if not the only one) I have ever encountered, that has no pretense whatsoever. It gives you all it has, there's no story hidden behind written texts, there's no gimmicks in the form of fancy graphics or character design, it wants to be a puzzle game, and it is exactly that. Now, you might ask why you might want to buy such a game, which, by my description might seem to have little to offer.\n\nWell, that's exactly it. By reading the other reviews, you'll see that every player got some kind of profound immersive experience out of it. I can ensure you, that the game offers none of this, but not in the sense that it doesn't offer content, but it doesn't contain any subtext whatsoever. It is the blankest slate modern videogaming has seen last years, and it is that which makes it so desirable. Like any good piece of poetry, interpretation is left completely up to the reader, even if the initial piece of art offers little content in itself. Kairo is the 12-verse poem which inspires linguists to write 100-page long critical readings. The quality and rigidity of the gameplay alone are a solid performance, but the way the creators manage to avoid any kind of context or narrative, without sacrificing any immersiveness, is an experience that must be had, and at this price, there's no excuse not to. Plus, it has Oculus Rift support!\n\nMost comparable to Antichamber (gameplay) and Flywrench (premise).","January 31, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best way to describe is it is a Myst like experience where you travel through enormous rooms and areas that are large puzzles to figure out. There's no weaponry, no enemies unless you count the puzzles and you pretty much cannot die (falling off ledges just puts you back on the ledge). Each room is dominated by a simple color scheme and the architecture is large and blocky as giving the environment an ancient feel.\n\nWhen played on a normal monitor, the simple graphics and plain architecture might seem like a negative. However, you activate VR, put on the Rift and you realize these graphics are now a strength. Just as Valve Steam Dev Days demo showed, so long as you keep latency low and frame rate high even a simple environment will seem real. Kairo delivers on this concept in spades. The large throne rooms, invisible maze arena, hollow pyramids, giant light orb and many other breathtaking sites fill this game. The slow pace and not too mind bending puzzles mean you're seeing new areas yet have plenty of time to appreciate each one. The sounds are different for each location and all are relaxing and never seem to be over bearing or painfully loud. There are a few cases where the sudden movement of the environment surprised me, but never did I feel the need to pull out of the game. The presence is strong and even with lengthy gameplay I did not notice much if any in the way of nausea. The frame rate seems great throughout with only one room (the one with four treadmills) showing lag.\n\nLike Dear Esther, I play this game standing up and do the fake foot walk to aid in my immersion. The look is not tied to the control movement so it's easy to look around and enjoy the environment as you travel through. Its very easy to get drawn into the game and forget that you're in your room playing a game.\n\nPeople probably have missed that this is a VR game as it does not seem to have the "VR Support" tag in the Steam search function. I've written the author and asked if he can get that added. As I said, for only $5 you're getting several hours of a great VR experience. A perfect game for those that prefer relaxed gameplay over the horror or shooter style games currently listed with VR support.","January 24, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's rather minimalist in that 99% of the time there is zero HUD, and there are no "use" keys. The only way to interact with the world is, much like Proteus, by just being. Standing on switches and pads, moving against things, and walking around so that objects react to your very position relative to them will solve most of the puzzles in this game.\n\nKairo's puzzles are mostly (if not all) logical. They are, however, of the type where you will often walk into a room, have literally no idea of how the room works, leave, come back later, and solve it immediately upon walking back in. So goes Kairo. If you're ever completely and absolutely stumped, there are hints provided by the in-game menu (which unfold in a UHS-style increasingly-specific manner), though it should rarely come to that.\n\nThere is a story to Kairo. I am no fan of the obtuse "insert your own ending/meaning/plot here" plots that have become so commonplace in indie games these days, and I was initially under the impression that Kairo had followed suit. But I was embarrassingly wrong. There is, underneath it all, a highly interesting story that Kairo tells. It is told over the course of the game, and the elements which make it up stare you in the face wherever you go - though you do have to put the puzzle pieces together, yourself. While I myself had noticed all of these elements and even picked up on a hint or two of where they were leading me, I completely glazed over most of it and didn't connect anything that cried out for connection.\n\nDo try not to make my mistake.\n\nThere are many interesting elements at work, here. It is in the interest of receiving the best experience that you can, for you to not only solve the puzzles, but to also pay attention to the world around you, and draw as many conclusions as possible along the way.","June 19, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I found Kairo and read that it advertised both aspects within its experience, I was instantly bought.\n\nKairo doesn't offer much in explanation. Every where you go is pretty much bathed in a single chromatic color with plain textures adorning every strange shape of your enviroment. This strangeness is accentuated even more with its plain droning music that is more akin to white noise. There is no death in Kairo either. There is no way to fail in Kairo. In Kairo it is just you, your mind and Kairo.\n\nNow, what exactly is Kairo and why are you there? To understand these things you must venture into your new world. Kairo is seperated into hubs, within in those hubs are different rooms that contain a puzzle. Solve the puzzles and move on to the next hub until you reach the end. That's your goal. The puzzles themselves are not the most complicated thing to accomplish, pull a switch, push a block, align a grid ect and if you ever find yourself stuck there are also helpful hints in the options!\n\nOther than getting to the end there are a few other things to accomplish as detailed by the achievements. Scattered throughout Kairo are 18 runes to collect, a few beacons to activate and a couple of tricky secrety puzzles to solve. I personally feel that if you are invested even in the slightist for Kairo's world then these extra goals should be mandatory for players to solve. The reward in narritive and overall experience trumps the extra hour or two one puts in to accomplish these goals. A helpful tip/warning though, always make sure you collect all the glyphs in an area before moving on! Backtracking for glyphs can be a pain in the ♥♥♥! And if you must backtrack wait until the last hub!\n\nOverall Kairo is a very very short game. This is a good thing though as with such games you will find yourself thinking more about the world as apposed to the gameplay. Kairo is very good food for your brain and whether it's on sale or for the normal five dollars trust me if you like exploration and mystery this is a fantastic deal.","November 27, 2013","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a funny coincidence because, in juxtaposition, these games couldn’t be further opposites. Qbeh-1 fosters a zen relaxed feeling with blue skies, cool water, open spaces, majestic buildings, relaxing ambient music, and a feeling of smooth progression using hands-on puzzles with standard building blocks. Kairo on the other hand is a strange game with a surreal, Stonehenge, modern abstract,  David Smith Cubi [www.guggenheim.org] feeling with graphics reminiscent of the 90s era (reminded me of an old dos game called S.C.A.R.A.B.). It has an environment that is discomforting and disconcerting, trapping the player in dark psychedelic tombs and inorganic voids. The game uses harsh grating sound effects and music and surrounds the player with static filled screens, sharp abstract constructions, and bizarre features. There are no controls beyond the basic movement controls; every “action” is performed by stepping on tiles or otherwise bumping into the various features found within the giant rooms. Perfecting the feeling of being lost in an abstract void is a complete lack of storyline or instruction beyond a list of puzzle hints that can be found in the menu. In short, the game makes you feel like you’re traveling through the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey. It’s not bad, but I wouldn’t recommend it to just anyone as it would offend all but those who can appreciate a game that is little more than a virtual modern art gallery with simple puzzles separating each exhibit.","February 26, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is all rectangles and circles and simple geometric shapes.  The music exists simply to generate atmosphere.  There is no "plot," but rather a series of puzzles that are to be completed simply because they exist.  The puzzles are generally fairly easy, although there are no real instructions and most of the puzzles require you to use your surroundings to figure out what to do.  In addition the "secret" puzzles are a pretty big step up in difficulty and will likely resort to the user having to consult a guide.\n\nAll of that said, the game succeeds with what it's trying to do.  The atmosphere is engrossing and engaging and the game is neither too easy or too difficult.  It's really a shame it was only 3-4 hours long, 'cause I think it could have been twice as long and not worn out its welcome.\n\nRating: 8/10","May 25, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They look really, really HORRIBBLE!\nIt really pulls you out of the experience if you can count the pixels of what is suppossed to be cracks and holes in walls.\n\nThe second weakness is Kairos Sonddesign or rather the lack thereoff. There are sounds and noises but they are more annoying then enriching and in many places sounds simply a re missing where there should have been some noice.\nIf giant structures in the world are moving i shouldn't feel like they are made of Styrophor and have no weight to them. Wich is exactly what happens in Kairo.\n\nKairo wants to be a minimalist thing but minimalistic doesn't mean low quality of assets and i feel that is what has been confused here when Kairo was designed.\n\nWould i recommend it?\n\nNah, not really.\nThere are several games on Steam right now that do what\nKairo wants to achieve in a far better and much more polished way.\n\nThere are Portal and Portal 2 (of course), Mind - Path to Talamus (wich i have only watched and not played yet) and more.\n\nAnd if you specifically look for a minimalist style there are NaissanceE, Antichamber and The Stanley Parabel.","October 26, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a simple yet aw- filled atmospheric journey that takes place in this supernatural-like world you've stumbled upon.\n\nPros:\n+ Increadible atmosphere.  Sometimes even daunting to look at with the great depth of field use by the dev.\n+ Music is more like a drone in various keys and melodies.  It's unique and quite pleasing to listen to.\n+ There is no linearity to it, well there is but you're free to tackle various areas at your leisure.\n+ Puzzles are both easy and incredibly challenging.\n+ Sandbox style freedom to explore the world.  It's not very large but the amount of rooms can make you forget where to go or where you've been.\n\nCons:\n- There is very little if any backstory but some may say none is needed with just how odd and abstract the setting is.\n- Some puzzles are a little too tough because they go completely unexplained or not elluded to.\n\nOverall I would rate this game a solid 8/10.  If you're into puzzles and don't mind exploring abstract scenery with no AI interaction then this game is 100% worth it at it's price.  On sale even better.

Somewhere between fascinating and terrifying, wondrous and foreboding. There are no monsters or even imminent threats really, but still your entire surroundings feel so ancient and so much grander than you that it creates an incredibly ominous feeling that never quite goes away.\n\nAs you interact with the world, huge abandoned structures come to life, and though the scenery changes and the paths are made clear, you never really know what’s going on under the surface. What do these huge contraptions actually do? Where is it leading? And how did all of it (and you for that matter) end up here? You get the sense that you’ll never really know, because it’s all just too ancient, too alien for your understanding.\n\nThe entire experience is rather chilling, and if you let yourself really become immersed in this world, you’ll probably find yourself making some pretty strange sounds, like I was, and laughing at points about just how uncomfortable it actually makes you.\n\nThe game isn’t perfect. There are bugs, but those tend to add to the strangeness of the environment in a way. One noticeable fault I had was that the footstep sounds are the exact same no matter what your pace is. This may sound minor, but it is rather noticeable at times when you are really taking it slow to take in your surroundings, which you will probably do quite a lot. Still a minor complaint in face of everything that’s really on display in this one.\n\nI bought it during a Summer Sale at $1.50, and I would probably recommend it at a fairly higher price-tag even still.\n\nMY SCORE - 8/10","June 21, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DDSUS/recommended/233230/","DDSUS","Carry Me Senpai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DDSUS/","74 products in account","I personally love games that are about exploration and  open to interpretation. When I found Kairo and read that it advertised both aspects within its experience, I was instantly bought.\n\nKairo doesn't offer much in explanation. Every where you go is pretty much bathed in a single chromatic color with plain textures adorning every strange shape of your enviroment. This strangeness is accentuated even more with its plain droning music that is more akin to white noise. There is no death in Kairo either. There is no way to fail in Kairo. In Kairo it is just you, your mind and Kairo.\n\nNow, what exactly is Kairo and why are you there? To understand these things you must venture into your new world. Kairo is seperated into hubs, within in those hubs are different rooms that contain a puzzle. Solve the puzzles and move on to the next hub until you reach the end. That's your goal. The puzzles themselves are not the most complicated thing to accomplish, pull a switch, push a block, align a grid ect and if you ever find yourself stuck there are also helpful hints in the options!\n\nOther than getting to the end there are a few other things to accomplish as detailed by the achievements. Scattered throughout Kairo are 18 runes to collect, a few beacons to activate and a couple of tricky secrety puzzles to solve. I personally feel that if you are invested even in the slightist for Kairo's world then these extra goals should be mandatory for players to solve. The reward in narritive and overall experience trumps the extra hour or two one puts in to accomplish these goals. A helpful tip/warning though, always make sure you collect all the glyphs in an area before moving on! Backtracking for glyphs can be a pain in the ♥♥♥! And if you must backtrack wait until the last hub!\n\nOverall Kairo is a very very short game.

I wouldn't mention it, except you can't seem to go 5 minutes of reading about this game without it being compared to Antichamber (indeed, this comparison is what brought me to the game in the first place), and I simply can't see why. Kairo is nothing like Antichamber, and if you're expecting it to be then you're about to be sorely disappointed. This is not to say that I didn't like Kairo, as you can presumably tell from the fact that this review is a recommendation. It's just that my initial view of it was tainted because I was constantly trying to compare it to Antichamber, and in that comparison it, like most games, falls very far short.\n\nFirst, the bad. The "puzzles"  are probably the main thing here. Barring a few rather interesting ones, they can be solved with minimal effort as soon as you work out what each element of the environment actually is. The main problem, I feel is the lack of a central mechanic. With no way to interract with the environment besides standing on things, puzzle design is extremely limited. In the game's defense, it uses this limited capacity well and rarely repeates itself, but nonetheless you will likely find much of the game unchallenging. Furthermore, the much-touted atmosphere is... eh. It's not bad, but it tries too hard to be creepy, which simply doesn't work with the gameplay. There are a few very effective moments, but overall you'll probably find you just don't notice it.\n\nHowever, the game just about makes up for these shortcomings with its stronger points. The environment design is excellent, using a rather minimalist block-based design for buildings which contrasts effectively with the more detailed decoration and interactable objects. Along with providing some spectacular views, this helps greatly with distinguishing puzzle piece from environment and the intuitive level design means you'll have little difficulty with finding your way around. Finally, the ending. Oh the ending. I strongly recommend playing through once to get the normal ending, then finding a guide online and playing through again for the hidden one. It won't have as much of an impact if you didn't play through once blind, but I honestly can't think of a way it could have ended better. Utterly unexpected yet actually carefully foreshadowed, it ties the game together and makes you look at the product as a whole from a completely different angle.\n\nOverall, I recommend Kairo, but only just. It makes up for its shortcomings in a number of ways, and it's certainly fairly unique. If you're looking for a challenge (or, like me, something Antichamber-esque), you won't find it. However, if you're looking for an unusual experience that effectively kills a few hours, you could do a lot worse. For only £4, I'd say it's worth the money.","August 25, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere was great, and it looked really cool. However, some of the puzzles were a bit -too- abstract, and for some reason touching a wall caused my framerate to drop dramatically. This got annoying in some areas, espeically being that the controls in this game aren't very tight, even with the settings tweaked.\n\nSome areas a a bit bigger than they need to be, so there's a lot of walking to do. Thank goodness there's a sprint button, but it doesn't change your speed that much.\n\nThis game has very little replay value, unless you're one of those people who want to painstakingly go through every nook and cranny to find these tiny symbols tucked in corners of the levels.\n\nI think the game was trying to tell me a story, but I didn't get any sort of feeling of resolution at the end, unless I am supposed to find all those little symbols. That sounds absolutely miserable though. That would be like playing a 3d eye spy game. I have better things to do with my life.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game. Puzzles were nice, except for a few, which were really stupidly hard. The game is not that long at all, so these few dark spots really put a dent in the overall experience.\n\nI almost gave this a thumbs down, but at the end of the day, it did hold my attention, and I did say twice in this review that I enjoyed it, so it gets a thumbs up from me.

I picked up a copy of Kairo because it was on sale and it looked interesting and played it through to completion (with the help of a guide to point me in the direction of my objectives, I admit. They're not that obvious some of the time).\n\nKairo manages to combine my two least favorite things in a game: slippery controls and almost required sprinting. In-game you can hear your footsteps so I know my feet weren't covered in oil... but it certainly felt like it. Many of the areas are expansive, which is cool, but if you want to try to complete the game the way I did you will need to backtrack through areas you've already visited. At times like these I found myself holding down the sprint key just to get through these areas as fast as possible. After about an hour of this, my left hand is pretty sore.\n\nOn the positive side the environments were cool and my favorite puzzle mechanic- the block puzzles where you have to stand in a certain position in the room to solve them- didn't feel like it was used often enough. I think there's enough in that idea alone to make an entire game out of, should the developer give it a try.\n\nThat said I cannot, in good faith, recommend Kairo. Not at full price, anyway. Five bucks for a ~3 hour game that's uncomfortable to play during the second half isn't a great deal by any stretch of the imagination.","September 14, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I'm glad I scooped it up! A great puzzle/exploration game with enigmas abound.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Consists of walking, jumping, and looking around. It's straightforward exploration with minor platforming. Puzzles round out the play, which you complete by stepping on platforms and bumping into objects to trigger them.\n\nPUZZLES: They're pretty intuitive for the most part, but there were a few I had to consult the helpfully provided "hints" option for (one in particular was hair rippingly frustrating because I'm terrible at math). Be prepared to comb areas carefully for clues, and draw out some diagrams here and there. It's quite satisfying to solve these puzzles, as they're fairly challenging, and it's made clear when you have activated a piece of machinery or opened a pathway by way of flashing lights, thunderous tumults, or loud gong strikes. It all amounts to a feeling of progress and getting one step closer to solving the mystery.\n\nVISUALS: Very minimalistic. Oftentimes, you wander through barren corridors or empty voids, with sparsely a decoration to look at. What there is to look at, though, serves to deepen the mystery. It feels like everything being presented - from images of Earth to the DNA double helix - has some type of underlying meaning. Otherwise, lighting and colouring is used to differentiate rooms, creating a very surreal effect. There's also some use of moving objects - floating, spinning globes, for example - that add some variance. In all, it's simplistic, but only where it needs to be.\n\nAUDIO: The highlight of the game for me. Again, simplicity is the standard here - a haunting, ambient soundtrack makes the place feel mysterious, dangerous, and cozy all at once. It's a strange effect, but it keeps the player guessing as to what, exactly, these structures are. As mentioned before, loud, sudden bells and gongs are used to indicate that the player has completed a puzzle, which is pretty satisfying. Radio static in certain locations and chimes during object interaction round out the auditory experience. Like the graphics, it feels like the sounds of the game highlight what's important.\n\nSTORY: Ostensibly, there isn't much of one. There is virtually no dialogue or cutscenes, and there are no NPCs present. Only environmental clues, mainly through recurring motifs, give rise to some semblance of a plot. I enjoyed wondering what Kairo could be about, and reading theories about it afterward.\n\nOverall, a great experience, which is even nicer considering I got this game for $1. It reminded me a lot of Myst (and Penumbra, somehow). There are mysteries to be unravelled for those willing to search for them.","January 28, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hints, though, are infinite and makes the game a breeze, I would suggest avoiding hints to immerse yourself. The environments are simple, yet beautiful. Also, the isolation and the sheer loneliness that this game brings is very eerie and makes you think anything could pop out at any moment, though, nothing.\n\nI would very much recommend this game.

That being said, I really, REALLY like what the end is all about, it just caught me off guard, that's all.\n\nI did really enjoy my time playing Kairo ^.^ It's all very smooth and I hardly found any of the puzzles too difficult. Perhaps the best thing about this game is the atmosphere it creates. I often didn't realize how much time was passing in the real world as I played it.\n\nThere are some hidden bonuses to find after completing the game and those were fun to search for as well.\n\n8/10","February 1, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tries to blend confusion and beauty, but ends up being a mess. Some puzzles are easy to solve, but others have no direction and are almost unsolvable if it weren't for google and the fourms.\n\nFirst, I'll start off with the puzzles. As I said, some are good brainteasers or just require good reflexes, but some made absolutely no sense. Sometimes I find myself scrambling around the current area looking for clues and hidden messages when the only task I have is to walk forward. Often, I find hidden messages that have no meaning, and I end up trying to figure out the purpose. Some harder puzzles had me pulling my hair out in frustration, which, in my opinion is okay. The problem is that I end up resorting to Google or the fourms for answers.\n\nOften, puzzles only reward you with more puzzles, sometimes harder, and sometimes easier. The difficulty in this game seems to be spontaneous, which is a mystery on its own. A lot of rooms have you walking for what seems like an eternity before giving you a clue, forcing you to glide back to the beginning and solve it.\n\nThere are games that pull off this "weird" type of mystery, but Kairo doesn't have that sort of feel. It throws strangeness and puzzles together, and those usually don't mix well. I couldn't tell what could be part of the current puzzle, and what's part of the scenery. For example: Near the beginning of the game, I found a large obelisk in what seemed to be a desert themed room. When I got close to it, I could hear a male voice saying random numbers in French. What does that mean?! I had set my language setting to English (Yes, there is a language setting, even though there is BARELY any words spoken throughout the entire game), but the game insisted to speak French.\n\nHonestly, besides the few good puzzles this game has and the atmosphere it provides, I can't think of anything more that would make this game okay.\n\nOverall, Kairo's bad elements outweigh it's good ones. I have not completed this game, and I have no desire to, as I feel like it will be like the rest of the game: Quirky, weird, dark, and cryptic. Not worth the $5 I paid. 4/10","October 3, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd say I enjoyed it for the most part.\n\nGameplay: The puzzles are usually pretty decent and not too difficult to figure out. However, there are times when it takes too much trial and error and guesswork rather than intuition and observation. I played through this with a walkthrough open in another tab because I found myself getting frustrated with certain puzzles. Most of them, however, are pretty straightforward. Besides the puzzles, this game is a walking simulator with some interesting environments.\n\nGraphics: Nothing special. It runs well and is ocassionally pretty to look at, but is mostly pretty bland.\n\nLevel Design: The environments are neat but I felt like it could've been designed better and been more polished. I've played loads of other trippy indie games such as this, and this one really felt like it was lacking in level design creativity. Most of the environments are pretty blocky and boring, and every room is a different shade of one color.\n\nStory: As is common with these strange indie games, the story isn't too important. From what I gathered, you're exploring old ruins and contraptions and you're reactivating them, bringing life back to these environments. That's the jist, it's nothing special.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience, and the length was just about right. If it had gone on longer I feel like I would've gotten sick of it. There's lots of secrets to keep you busy if you're an achievment hunter, but the gameplay wasn't interesting enough for me to find all of the secrets.

Its atmosphere is surreal, strange, and overwhelmingly lonesome. That's the big word I think I'd use to describe this game - lonesome, and that lonesomeness becomes more and more eerie the further you go into the game. You are the only living thing in Kairo - everything else is a hollow, dead fascimile, with archetecture eerily reminiscent of human construction and yet alien enough you might think you woke up in R'lyeh. The world of Kairo is a small world that feels massive, alien, and completely dead... and I love it to pieces and back.\n\nWandering through the surreal and beautifully eerie world of Kairo is very relaxing, the puzzles are very intuitive and can easily be solved with a little thought, and the simple design really makes it feel like you're stranded. And yet, solving the puzzles is so satisfying, satisfying in that "I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed genius!" sort of way. The range of feelings you get from Kairo goes from triumph, curiosity, and awe to fright, paranoia, and hopelessness - and what is art if not something that makes you feel deeply? Anyone who claims video games aren't art has never played this, and that's a damn shame. Did I mention that the music and the game's design is just so surrealistically gorgeous?\n\nSeriously, BUY THIS GAME. It's maybe $5 for a wonderful little piece of surrealistic artwork that recaptures the eerie loneliness and thirst for adventure that Myst did so many years ago in 1992. Kairo is a gem of an indie puzzle game, and anyone who is a fan of surreal artwork, puzzle games, and games where you chill and wander for a bit will love this. You really do owe it to yourself to play it at least once. Who knows?

I wouldn't mention it, except you can't seem to go 5 minutes of reading about this game without it being compared to Antichamber (indeed, this comparison is what brought me to the game in the first place), and I simply can't see why. Kairo is nothing like Antichamber, and if you're expecting it to be then you're about to be sorely disappointed. This is not to say that I didn't like Kairo, as you can presumably tell from the fact that this review is a recommendation. It's just that my initial view of it was tainted because I was constantly trying to compare it to Antichamber, and in that comparison it, like most games, falls very far short.\n\nFirst, the bad. The "puzzles"  are probably the main thing here. Barring a few rather interesting ones, they can be solved with minimal effort as soon as you work out what each element of the environment actually is. The main problem, I feel is the lack of a central mechanic. With no way to interract with the environment besides standing on things, puzzle design is extremely limited. In the game's defense, it uses this limited capacity well and rarely repeates itself, but nonetheless you will likely find much of the game unchallenging. Furthermore, the much-touted atmosphere is... eh. It's not bad, but it tries too hard to be creepy, which simply doesn't work with the gameplay. There are a few very effective moments, but overall you'll probably find you just don't notice it.\n\nHowever, the game just about makes up for these shortcomings with its stronger points. The environment design is excellent, using a rather minimalist block-based design for buildings which contrasts effectively with the more detailed decoration and interactable objects. Along with providing some spectacular views, this helps greatly with distinguishing puzzle piece from environment and the intuitive level design means you'll have little difficulty with finding your way around. Finally, the ending. Oh the ending. I strongly recommend playing through once to get the normal ending, then finding a guide online and playing through again for the hidden one. It won't have as much of an impact if you didn't play through once blind, but I honestly can't think of a way it could have ended better. Utterly unexpected yet actually carefully foreshadowed, it ties the game together and makes you look at the product as a whole from a completely different angle.\n\nOverall, I recommend Kairo, but only just. It makes up for its shortcomings in a number of ways, and it's certainly fairly unique. If you're looking for a challenge (or, like me, something Antichamber-esque), you won't find it. However, if you're looking for an unusual experience that effectively kills a few hours, you could do a lot worse. For only £4, I'd say it's worth the money.","August 25, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I did, it was surreal and interesting to explore and wander.  Then the puzzles came.  Dear god, the puzzles.  Everything outside of the game made it seem as though the puzzles would be short and scarce throughout the game...  That is a lie!  The puzzles make about as much sense as something from a point-and-click adventure game.  The puzzle is nearly always figuring out the mechanics of the puzzle, rather than what to do, which is horribly frustrating.  I never thought it possible to rage quit a first person exploration game.  Then I did the impossible, and did just that.\n\nThe enviroments themselves are nice, usually only using one or two colors per room.  The only problem I really have with the world is that it's incredibly inconsistant.  The world is obviously not made to feel like it has rules, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with.

They're not long.\n\nPros:\n- Puzzles become interesting when you have no "hand" or "activate" controls. By limiting the player to mere movement controls, old puzzles feel fresh, and there's an extra sense of accomplishment with even fairly simple puzzles.\n- The environment's minimalist polygon theme manages, surprisingly, to stay varied, interesting, and even evokative throughout the game, contributing to the theme of "strange and yet familiar" that pervades.\n- Difficulty to normal end is low, difficulty to secret end is high.\n- No penalty for exploration, experimentation, or taking your time.\n- Overall, definitely enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n- The "story" aspect is a little too vague. You paid $5, folks, this ain't Myst or Portal. While there are enough "clues" that a player can vaguely put together a plot (and considerably more blatant clues as rewards for solving secret puzzles), there's plenty that's just left to imagination.\n- The mechanic that resets you to a safe ledge can glitch considerably, leaving you in a fall-to-your-death loop, though this can be solved by exiting the game and reloading.\n- One of the final secret puzzles is actually impossible to solve on your own. Your game will have 1/5 of the solution, and which fifth is chosen at random. So you're either going to need lots of friends, or cheat and look at a walkthrough.\n\nFinal Note: Don't take my playtime as a good guide to the runthrough time of this game. I got irritated and consulted a walkthrough for two of the secret puzzles and half the rune locations.","August 5, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I began playing the "main story", so to speak, in the afternoon and finished it later at night. And by the end of it I was genuienly spooked at each new level.

But one of those dreams that, when you wake up you tell yourself: "Phew! I'm glad I'm back home at last".\nIn short. This was a very... interesting experience.

I'd say I enjoyed it for the most part.\n\nGameplay: The puzzles are usually pretty decent and not too difficult to figure out. However, there are times when it takes too much trial and error and guesswork rather than intuition and observation. I played through this with a walkthrough open in another tab because I found myself getting frustrated with certain puzzles. Most of them, however, are pretty straightforward. Besides the puzzles, this game is a walking simulator with some interesting environments.\n\nGraphics: Nothing special. It runs well and is ocassionally pretty to look at, but is mostly pretty bland.\n\nLevel Design: The environments are neat but I felt like it could've been designed better and been more polished. I've played loads of other trippy indie games such as this, and this one really felt like it was lacking in level design creativity. Most of the environments are pretty blocky and boring, and every room is a different shade of one color.\n\nStory: As is common with these strange indie games, the story isn't too important. From what I gathered, you're exploring old ruins and contraptions and you're reactivating them, bringing life back to these environments. That's the jist, it's nothing special.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience, and the length was just about right. If it had gone on longer I feel like I would've gotten sick of it. There's lots of secrets to keep you busy if you're an achievment hunter, but the gameplay wasn't interesting enough for me to find all of the secrets.

The film grain effect is just a static overlay that feels more distracting than stylistic, and while early areas of the game are very visually engaging and seem like they have a plan and purpose behind their layout, later areas just feel slapped together, using almost random geometric shapes and often just feel like the design had little to no thought at all. A fair amount of rooms have a purposefully grand scale, which is usually unnessicary considering you have to run back and forth in them to solve a puzzle. Of course this might be a purposeful choice to evoke a specific emotion from that level, I just felt pulled out of the experience.\n\nNow obviously I can't review a game without discussing how it plays and the mechanics, which also sadly fall flat. The game only gives you three commands, the ability to look, jump, and sprint. Nothing else. This is sometimes problematic to solving puzzles as you need to physically touch certain objects in order to "activate" them. While feeling awkward by itself, the player has a sort of floaty momentum to them that is accentuated by the fact you need to ram into objects to solve puzzles, which are also obtuse. There are different symbols used to differentiate switches, but the logic behind them often changes. Sometimes they're supposed to be literal, as in you have to activate the exact sime switch, but sometimes they're representations of numbers, which is confusing when the rest of the game had been using a literal interpretation. Luckily there is a hint system built in, which solves most of my gripes with the presentation not being very clear.\n\nAll in all, I feel like this game needs a lot of polish, but is still worth the price, especially if it's on sale.","December 22, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, sometimes I felt a lack of it. In such cases, I usually turn on something on my own (ambient would be appropriate here), but not this time. The Silence. Silence of dead world. Only ruins of forgotten ancient civilization. Only you and your thoughts. Sometimes you can here someone voice. Man repeating "zero" or counting in russian "five, six, seven".

You walk through majestic and mysterious places solving puzzles, some simple, some that might need a google search. Only once did I actually need a google search to help me solve a puzzle (turns out i was right about how to solve it, was just applying it incorrectly). Solving every secret and puzzle, especially those not required to beat the game, will definitely take an internet search to finish.\n\nGameplay only requires moving and the rare jump and nothing else. There are no other requirements, all puzzles are solved with simply walking, and buttons/interactive objects are used simply by walking up to/on them. The simplicity of both gameplay and the story telling is not for everyone, but I personally loved the game.\n\nI would recommend this game for people who enjoying exploring and doing unrequired things in games and also enjoy puzzles and deep thinking. If you prefer very linear and directed gameplay or don't enjoy going outside of the main story to explore, you probably will dislike the game.","January 18","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there is no concrete story or true gameplay beyond the puzzle solving, so if that turns you off, this title is not for you.\n\nIn the current gaming setting of triple A titles with increasingly beautiful and realistic graphics, I was a bit off-put by the blocky, grainy architecture of the game.  At first.  Then I realized how brilliantly atmospheric it was.  Lonely and creepy, Kairo is very reminiscent of the first Myst game: a solo protagonist working their way through a mysterious world, piecing the story together as you go, never quite sure if you've gotten it right.\n\nIf you're a completionist, prepare for a lot of backtracking, as some things are only activated after you get all the way through an area.  If you're not, don't worry about missing out on anything more than full exploration of the environment.  The final secret is funny but not story-related.","June 25, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can see how its abstract minimalism would be dream-like with oculus rift, however I'm still not compelled to explore such a low-quality "mysterious" world. There's no "words" and that's okay, but maybe if the narrative was less vague or if solving any of the "puzzles" in the game actually mattered, maybe then I would be interested in finding my way out of a maze or two.  Here is your gold star for effort developers, but overall I found Kario less fun than one of those Sudoku / Crossword / Maze toilet books and more expensive, too.","July 19, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hints are vague and pretty much useless, and it doesn't explain anything, it just throws you in without giving you an objective or instructions or a reason for why you're even where you are.

Explorable empty space is used to show importance of an object in the room, and over-saturated lighting is used almost randomly, but consistently through a room.\nSound design follows graphical design, and follows a theme of emptiness and alienation in an abstract world.\nThe physics and control are poor, but only because they are unnecessary for the gameplay.\nGameplay itself is puzzle solving in insolation, but the main story puzzles are simple. It's a small game that takes time to explore for 100% completion. The 100% content beyond the main story puzzles just involves finding hidden things and backtracking after hitting an obvious switch to find a matching shape somewhere.\n\nAfter breaking it down like that, I think it'd make for a really nice modern art machinima.\nAs far as being a game, it can be depressing for a few reasons. That's why I recommend it.","May 29","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d33c/recommended/233230/","d33c","D3C","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d33c/","115 products in account","Kairo is a slightly flawed gem of a first-person walking and exploration game. It requires a bit of investment to stay interested in the beginning, but if you're into discovery and piecing together parts of a mystery, it eventually rewards that patience.\n\nIn the beginning, you appear in Kairo with no explanation of who you are, where you are, what its or your purpose is, and no apparent indication of what you should do next, other than possibly head towards the one visible structure in the distance. Hints as to possible answers to all of those questions gradually unfold as you proceed through the three main levels of the game. Ultimately, the game never concretely answers any of those questions, but gives you enough (especially if you're determined to hunt down and unlock all of its sometimes-obscure riddles) to put together your guess, your interpretation of what you've just been through. For some this may be frustrating, not to know the absolute official canon truth of the matter, but I see it as one of the game's strengths in creating a real sense of mystery. This is not your typical berk-without-a-past-uncovers-his-past story—however much you discover, you remain without a past.\n\nThe game suffers from some minor flaws in execution—the occasional video clipping problem in tight spaces, oddly getting stuck on stairs and needing to jump to continue, footstep sounds that are weirdly unsynchronized to your movement—that reflect a slight lack of polish. For me, these minor issues pale in comparison to what the game achieves artistically. It manages to create, through the grand scale of its environments, the use of colour, and its moody, atmospheric soundtrack, a feeling of being very small and alone in an intimidating, unknown world which is somehow broken and needs fixing. The puzzles involved in the fixing range from trivial to frustratingly obscure, but for the impatient there are guides and walkthroughs, and for the determined, there's a great sense of accomplishment in untangling the secret.","May 27","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed the puzzles and how it looked, especially the grain filter, that gave it a really interesting feel. The game is not horror at all, though it can be a bit spooky due to the environment and the sounds, but thats what I loved about it. The game also had a Myst feel to it, if anyone reading this actually knows what that game is. Sure this game may seem strange at first, but give it a try, you might actually like it!

It is an artsy, abstract and super minimalist walking simulator. And, as such, I think it excel, as it is always throwing at you new kind of imagery, puzzle and scenery. At no point I found Kairo to be lazy, reusing too often room design. I recommend using a guide though. Due to the minimalistic approch of the game, some puzzle are very cryptic.\n\nIf the idea of walking through monochrome rooms of block, sphere and triangle while engulfing deeply into your own though and emotion, you will like this game. My advice is to surrender yourself to Kairo and let every bit of creativity sink in without looking for a finite explanation of what is happening around you.","June 3","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
