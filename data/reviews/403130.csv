Did not experience any crashes. However, I did experience connection network errors trying to connect to online. After a few tries I got it working and played with a friend. It was a lot of fun. I recommend this if you like scrabble and have friends online on steam to play with.","December 19, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I mean, it is scabble, there isn't much to screw up. Game is obviously designed for touch screen devices, but isn't cumbersome using a mouse.  I like to get really roasted and play with the wife.

The AI just played "gorea" and I find no definition of it online. Being able to look up words is also a good way to teach kids their meaning.\n\nThe AI speed annoys me. It seems to be deliberately slowed down to feel "realistic", but after all the waiting and the sound and animation effects, the result is most of the time spent by you in the game involves idly staring at the screen.\n\nThe game also crashed when I finished the tutorial and tried to play a real game. I'm hoping that's not a sign of bugginess throughout the product.\n\nCompared to the competitors, the game does have a nice and polished look, which is why I chose to purchase it. However, I think asking nearly CAN$8 for it a bit too much. CAN$4 is a fairer price.\n\nSince competition is very slim, I'm siding with "Yes" on the recommendation, but the game can use significant improvement to make it more enjoyable.","March 19","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
