They're bad and clumsy, and I can guarentee you'll be spending quite a chunk of your time spinning and positioning yourself perfectly like an idiot and moving the camera alongside it to try and find what is happening. The game has thirty levels, and I don't think you'll be wanting to reach the end any time soon.\n\nPros\n\nGraphics are "oke"\n\nMusic is good , fits the mood of the game\n\nCons\n\nYou can't change the controls in game or pause\nThe controls\nTHE CONTROLS\nOH GOD THE CONTROLS\nGame feels unfinished\nSeems buggy and glitchy\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall Verdict\nNo. This is a bad game. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who likes tower defense at all.\nthis game HAD potential if they would have finished it. This feel so unfinished...\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","November 18, 2015","false","9.0"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

If the controls and interface were improved it would be quite a good game. As it is, I was often shooting in a direction where my mouse wasn't pointing. And why oh why can WASD not be used ?! It forces mouse controls when it really shouldn't have. You can't even press escape during a level. The English in game isn't great. The game needs a tutorial.\n\nThe graphics are okay and the music is quite good and appropriate, but that's all I can speak about positively.","March 30","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
