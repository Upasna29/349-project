"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rtuchiha/recommended/228760/","rtuchiha","Uchi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rtuchiha/","70 products in account","Let me explain something about this game. This game has a multiplayer that is NOT for the casual gamer. It is quite competitive, and it likes to display this competitiveness all up in yo' face. You WILL see that one dude (or multiple, I mean, they're everywhere) that can finish the track in half the time it takes you to finish it. I see this every other time I go onto this game.\n\nThe game has a steep learning curve that requires at least an hour or more in order to learn the basic physics of the game. After that, there are tricks that, once learned, can help you set better times in the multiplayer. (i.e. Left-CTRL braking & using a controller.) The tracks in this game play a major role in shaping your skills, as they are user-created. They can go from being pretty basic to being some of the hardest tracks you'll encounter on your time here.\n\nI know very well that time makes all the difference in the multiplayer. In fact, it MEANS the difference. Times are what determine your position in a round, and the time is calculated in thousandths of a second, making photo finishes seem like nothing. You can set a record time in a single round, only for someone to beat you by .002. It really can be that close. There IS the odd tie, but it doesn't happen that often.\n\nNow, you should go into this game knowing that you're not gonna win your first race by a long shot. Practice makes perfect. It blends in the arcade-style driving physics and fantasy environment with a competitve multiplayer that stands with some of the best. I've never been so involved in a racing game that isn't a sim. Trackmania 2 also has its own ladder system, which determines how well you do amongst other players worldwide. And we're not only talking worldwide, either. It can track official progress to as close as your own state (if you live in the US, that is). You have a number for everything, from server rankings, to single player rankings, to country rankings. The better you do, the more the number goes down, and the more accomplished you feel.\n\nI recommend this game, because it makes the $20 you'll dump on this game worth the cost. Now, do mind, this was a game that was made BEFORE the UPlay era, so it doesn't require the UPlay launcher. Instead, it has its own launcher for launching titles, although it still is in need of serious revision.\n","October 20, 2014","true","63.1"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","43","45","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointfivecaliber/recommended/228760/","pointfivecaliber","Nick @ 1440p","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointfivecaliber/","229 products in account","The reason I bought this game is because this website, GaiKai, had a streaming service which would let you play demo's of the most popular releases in your browser. Kind of like NVidia streaming. I used to play this game every time our class went to the computer lab, like the naughty kid I am. Maybe this review will be kind of biased by my nostalgic feelings, or maybe it'll be biased the complete opposite direction, because I dispise the early years of my middle school. Enough about that, now about the game.\n\nTrackMania is basically a take on Mario Kart's Time Trial system. No other racers on the road, just you, your ghosts and the ghosts of whoever you downloaded. Get to the end as fast as possible. Unlike Mario Kart, however, you can do barrel rolls, ride on walls, jump ridiculous heights and all kinds of stuff like that.\n\n//NOTE: I know Mario Kart 8 fixed the whole wall-riding stuff. You get my point. MKWii didn't have this guff.\n\nSo, what about the game itself?\n\nPositive\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous\nThis game is amazingly well-looking, even in resolutions as high as 2560*1440, this game really looks amazing. Maybe the quick racing-thing blurs my vision of the textures and shadows, but if it makes you feel like it looks okay, it's all right, isn't it?\nThe game has an excellent difficulty ramp-up\nAmong other racing games that are either way too easy (Burnout paradise) or games that make me want to rip my hair out (F-Zero GX), I feel like TrackMania (not just Canyon, the entire series) have done an astounding job at making the buildup enjoyable for everyone. The higher flags being the easiest, and the black flag being the very hardest.\nThe track unlocking system is not annoying\nAny game that has a track unlocking system always gives me this sense of "Why the hell do you have this?". Even in, yes this game again, Mario Kart, I find it frustrating that I can only select the first two cups and have to beat the squishiest AI in existence to go on to the next four tracks. In TrackMania, Silver feels rewarding from time to time, and unlocking those tracks is a challenge. It's not a chore, but it's also certainly not something that takes hours of effort. It's not like you'll feel happy about unlocking those next tracks, but you will be curious as of what will be next in the line.\nNegatives\nI really only have one bad thing to say about this game.\nThe value of this game isn't as good as Nations Forever.\nWhat do I mean with this? Basically, €20,- for this game is absolutely wonderful. I'd be glad to dish out €45,- for each of the Trackmania games (but seriously, Gabe, do not raise the prices). The issue is, there is not a massive amount of difference between this and Nations Forever, and that game is free. This game is marginally better, but I don't think it can outvalue its free counterpart. This is especially the case for players with a not as strong computer, as those will have a hard time running this game on decent settings, whereas Nations Forever has run on every computer I threw at it (with the exception of one with a soldered on graphics chip. It had 128 MB Vram, go figure).\nOverall, this game is excellent. Don't let the negative factor stop you from buying it, at all. If I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 9.8 / 10.\n\nWith tax calculations it'd be a 10/10.","January 6, 2015","true","9.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnb_owl/recommended/228760/","tnb_owl","Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnb_owl/","117 products in account","Trackmania Canyon is more than your average arcade racer. If you're looking for the Quake of racing games, this is it.\n\nIt's real time leaderboard incorperation into multiplayer servers serves not only as a visual clarification of your improvements over time, but an insentive to keep playing, and claim those tops spots. The UI is plain, simple and to the point, as well as being easy on the eye.\n\nThe game boasts a singleplayer series of tracks that range in difficulty, with end-game content being hard to unlock, and extremely difficult without many hours of practise. You can do 'offical' runs every 5 minutes when practicing, which will upon completion upload your time to a leaderboard with the change to get SP or skill points, however internet connection is not manditory to play these.\n\nThe game has a very long learning curve, with the player having to develop their muscle memory with the car physics, learning tricks that help the top players shave off those milliseconds. There a lot of flicking involved, that's for sure.\n\nThe physics in the game feel wonderful, and have a very dynamic, full feeling; giving you a sense of complete control over your car. Something that many racing games fail to capture to this day. Combine that with a plethora of user created tracks - from technical ESL-styled and Speedtech courses to LOL and Mr DVD minis, each track potentially introducing a new way to take certain turns, making new tips and tricks to learn for every possible transistion, turn, jump; you name it.\n\nAnother great plus to mention is the community with the vast majority of players being friendly, and willing to give you tips on how to improve your driving. A small percentage of the playerbase of the populous trolls, but that's to be expected for any online community, niche or not.\n\nIf you're looking for something to get into that'll take you a while to learn, whilst having fun getting there, then this game is for you. Play for a month then look back on your first replays and you'll really see the improvement which is another great positive about the game as your progress really does show.\n\nThe only downside about the game  would be the lack of a search option. Finding specific maps or replays is difficult when you've amassed a large library of either is difficult and time consuming.","March 7, 2015","true","448.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, the main problem of an empty game is that the maps don't change (in some servers), some people already played the maps around a thousand times when the game is about creating and sharing maps.\n\nIf you never, ever played TrackMania, prepare hours of lessons of driving because this one is "the new generation of driving", you are a soap in the canyon, use water to make lather and then slide. The first time is always the hardest, but always the best. If I didn't like this game, I wouldn't had ever spent almost 3k hours of my lifetime playing any TrackMania since 2006.\nThe price is worth it.

This game is remarkably different, and certainly an improvement.\n\nThe graphics are much better than TrackMania United, showing off crystal-clear textures and some very nice filters and reflection effects. But for TrackMania, graphics really aren't that important. It's all about the car and the tracks.\n\nThe Canyon car drives very differently from the 'traction block'-like cars of yesteryear, and really feels more like you're actually driving a car. The car throws weight into the usual precise TrackMania driving, and ensures that you have to know not only the perfect line but also how the car reacts to skidding and countersteering to get a perfect time.\n\nTracks are insane thanks to the huge array of blocks, and making tracks has never been easier with the refined editor.\n\nIf you are new to TrackMania, beware the difficulty. Everyone is driving cars that all drive exactly the same and there are no collisions between cars, so your only goal is to drive the insane tracks as perfectly as possible, which is usually much easier said than done.\nIf you enjoyed the original TrackMania and crave an even deeper experience, Canyon will keep you entertained for a long time. If you want a fun, fast, and skill-based online racer with no imbalance or BS, there is no real standout reason not to get this game.","December 28, 2013","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/228760/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?\n\nWell, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.\n\nIf you reference SteamCharts[steamcharts.com] for Canyon, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 10 and 100. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nIt's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.\n\nHere's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.","November 9, 2013","false","1.5"," 48 of 95 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","48","95","0","2"

Switching from Nations to this, they've added a good deal to the physics: Drifting feels controlled, as opposed to driving on ice. Dirt feels like dirt, now, and the effects of it are apparent enough to strategically account for.\n\nThe singleplayer is more varied, it seems, and serves as an excellent training ground for the new techniques presented in Canyon. But the heart of the game is in the multiplayer, which includes things I haven't seen in other Trackmanias. It feels like the map-makers of Canyon are more devoted, and more creative, in a lot of cases.\n\nIf you are new to the series, then Stadium might be a more preferred starting point, but Canyon definitely feels more satisfying.

Note that car acceleration is very high, but handling and grip is poor; you literally glide across the road like wet soap on ceramic.\n\nThis was the first of the TM2 series, and its also the least polished.  Other games fully exploit the features and such that Trackmania 2 has available.\n\nNote that environments are canyons, dirt roads, and sand.  That's it.  There isn't much concrete or manmade aesthetic blocks you can use to create custom, beautiful environments.  As such, its a bit harder to create custom maps for this game.\n\nHowever, this game is beautiful and its fun to play.

The video shows dozens of cars in intense races through crazy environments. That can happen, but the online community hasn't taken off with this release. What you will experience is an absolutely consistent skill-oriented precision racing game. You will have to drive and drift as perfectly as possible through tracks that can have huge jumps, wallrides, and loops.\n\nFortunately, the vehicle handling is brilliant. Drifting in Trackmania 2: Canyon is probably the best in any racing game I have played, and you still have the ability to maintain precise control during that drift. This is a game about mastery of a track, where every millisecond matters and mistakes mean restarting the race.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theherrick/recommended/228760/","theherrick","Herrick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theherrick/","168 products in account","Aside from the absolute scam of selling us environments one at a time instead of the three pack format of the past games (stadium was originally free to play hence it's stand alone debut) the game is littered with technical problems. Chief being that the promised ability to swap between Canyon, Stadium and Valley at will doesn't actually work right now. It can be somewhat fixed by using the maniaplanet client instead of steam but it is still clunky at best and means a majority of servers will only use a single map type. This is utterly pathetic considering Trackmania united had seven environments all merged together.\n\nVisually the game looks a lot better on the Trackmania 2 engine, there’s a load more effects and post processing. The game even has a superficial damage model now which is a nice novelty. Requirements are still fairly low although it has had a definite impact for the lowest end machines so beware if you’re accustomed to playing United on a toaster.\n\nThe editor this time has a far smaller selection of blocks than past games and this limits track design to a large degree, this has been mostly addressed now but for a long time it was perhaps the worst part of the game, disastrous when trackmania is sold on the concept of players making all the content.\n\nNowadays the problem is the community, the high price tags for individual environments coupled with technical problems from Steam demanding a restart to swap between them leads to a massively fragmented community. Simply put nobody is ever playing, even at peak times it’s rare to find more than a few hundred people playing the game compared to the thousands that United had even without the F2P users.\n\nYou may at first think this isn’t much of an issue, Trackmania is after all about time trials there is no collision between other cars and there is even a toggle to render players if you find them distracting. So playing on an empty server isn’t as impact as it is on other games. HOWEVER remember that Trackmania has always been about player created maps, they quite literally make for almost all of the content in this game. Fewer people playing means fewer people making maps and less content for everyone involved. Most of the great map makers from united and earlier have simply elected to stay in United if not outright left the series.\n\nOverall I simply cannot recommend this game, I want to like it but there are just too many flaws and almost all of them stem from Ubisoft’s utterly insane business model for the latest three instalments in the series. If you are new to the Trackmania games stick with United it simply has more of everything.","July 24, 2014","false","3.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.\n\nedit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)\n\nPros\n\n-- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.\n\n-- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a "playlist" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.\n\n-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.\n\n-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.\n\nCons\n\n-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on "Stadium" from Steam, then decide to play "Canyon" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.\n\n-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the "Start Game" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.\n\n-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit "more blue" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)\n\n-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use "multiple profiles" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say "You must connect online to launch the game." I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.\n\n-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.\n\n-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).\n\n-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)\n\n-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to "take" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.\n\n-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.\n\nIf you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review?

I installed on an old computer back a while and loved this game, but ended up buying a new computer. Now that I attempt to intall it on a new computer, I am told that the cd key has already been used. I am on the exact same steam and Trackmania account, but I somehow don't own the game anymore? I can still technically play the game, but since I "do not own it" I cannot play multiplayer, use workshop mods (half the fun), or play more than an hour a day.\nI then attempted to ask for help on the steam discussions but all i got was responses from a developer telling me that I should be using the same account, can't log in, or should just ignore the "cd key has already been used" message.\n\nTL;DR: I can't play this game anymore because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM, and the developer is telling me to ignore it.","January 30","false","2.2"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

By hardcore I mean unforgiving and performance focused. It can be exhilarating once you get in the flow, although the tracks are often too obfuscated for that (made worse by the absence of any minimap and their extreme narrowness).\nThe biggest problem about this game though isn't the game itself but the interface and the ManiaPlanet client which are horrendous. When buying I naively expected to find easy in-client map browsing (which was the reason for my uninformed impulse purchase) but it's sad to see nothing has evolved since the early TM days and browsing and downloading and playing user-made tracks is still a pain in the ♥♥♥. Another non-game related gripe is about the stupid "1 Mania Planet account per key" system which means you basically lose your game if you lose your Mania Planet IDs. The menu navigation is pretty bad too.\n\nSo overall the game in itself is very challenging and fun, but everything around it sucks. My rating is to balance out the positive reviews because I would still recommend it.","October 20, 2014","false","23.0"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asseaterddl/recommended/228760/","asseaterddl","yeah right","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asseaterddl/","166 products in account","Trackmania 2 Canyon has a lot of pro's and con's and is only really just getting a thumb's up from me. This is also purely my opinion.\n\nPros:\n- Good Graphics\n- Good Car Physics (i.e. good/fun drfiting and handling)\n- Variety of single player maps\n- Good multiplayer\n- I haven't tried Map Making, but I've heard from friends and reading reviews that it's good.\n- Leaderboards for lap times is excellent, and adds some competitiveness in both single player and multiplayer.\n\nCons:\n- The only real game mode is time attack, which has no collision with other cars, and is purely just you driving and seeing the 'ghost' of other cars. This makes the game repetitive after a while. There needs to be other game modes like Race or Elimination, with collision. This would add heaps more fun and diversity, and reduce the repetitiveness.\n- You only get one type of car. This isn't a major problem, but having a few different looking cars just adds more diversity which is good.\n- As it is TrackMania 2 CANYON, theres only 1 type of environment. Yes this is expcted when buying the game, but once again, this makes the game repetitive, and for $20 you'd expect a little more.\n- Car customization is very basic, and is still hard to do.  And you're customized skins can't be seen (Unless they download the skin youve made manually) by other players on multiplayer, so you're basically showing off your nice skin to bots on single player.\n- There's no real atmosphere. Your purely just driving through a track. There's no birds flying around, or planes flying over or anything to add some atmosphere to the game. It's just your car and the track.\n- This isn't really a con, but, when your car falls into water, theres no splash at all. It just goes into the water and NOTHING happens, you just sink or float.\n\nSo overall, you're paying $20 to drive 1 car around various tracks, doing the same game mode over and over again. Yes, this is still fun, especially with friends, but the game lacks any real change in pace, and gets repetitive after a while. Overall I would say buy it when it's on special, as it is definitely not worth $20.","September 13, 2014","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ward [29ID]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lookaquarter/","228 products in account","If you are looking for a racing game that requires pinpoint accuracy, precision, and timing, combined with some of the most unrealistic, yet beautifully perfect drifting, all into one, here you go. The graphics are beautiful, however you probably won't have the time to appreciate them to their fullest extent while trying to dodge various obstacles or while trying to get that one corner just right. Without having to worry about your car actually colliding with the others, you can focus fully on getting yourself to that finish line as fast as possible, with the added benifit of a major decrease in lag on even the worst internet connections. However, I do have a warning, this game is not easy. If you're the kind of gamer that expects to be instantly good at a game, this game will catch you off guard. Basically, get the demo, play it for a little bit, if you like the driving physics and feel you can put some time into this game, then go ahead and buy it already. However, if you're the type of person who is easily frustrated or you think that you wouldn't really be willing to put an effort into learning the game, stay far FAR away. It's a waste of twenty bucks if you don't think you can take the time to learn it.\n\nI recommend this game due to the fact that it is the perfect arcady, pulsepounding, physics breaking racing game that we've needed for a long time.","December 11, 2013","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is basically a time trial game, but what a game! The driving is not realistic. You will do tight turns, stunts and drifts. You will drive at ridiculous speeds, stack, and try again. You will make a tight, high-speed turn, followed by a jump, fly across an enourmous gulf, land, do a loop, and then crash into a finish line.

What makes this game so enjoyable?\n\nENVINORMENT\nWell especially for Canyon, theres unique desert envinorment that makes you think "lol, how desert racing would be fun?". But if you check some screens or videos, you will see the most interesting race blocks, you ever seen in world of racing games. You will see loops, wallrides, ramps, cars driving huge canyons. There are so many possibilities with making your own track !\n\nVEHICLE\nThis envinorment is about drifting. This cars drifts are so awesome... my english is too bad to tell how great it feels.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER\nOfficial campaign will take few hours to finish... unless you want to get every medal, then it will take more than just few days.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nNo collisions! Every player you play with on server in the same time are just ghosts. You cant hit them and they cant hit you. Its all just time attack.\n\nMORE OPTIONS\nThis game have so much to offer... so i will just write a list of some things: Track Editor, Car Paint, 2D Skins, 3D skins download or create, custom titles download or create, Friends and Chat ingame system (non-steam), and  much more options.\n\n+ Car handling is unbelievebly awesome (at least for me), but hard to master\n+ Maniaplanet system\n+ Editor\n\n- Time attack race only - no collisions, opponents you can see on servers are just "ghost" you can drive through\n\n10/10","February 27, 2013","true","551.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take control of a muscle car and race around mountainous courses while trying to keep your vehicle in one piece. The cars in TrackMania² Canyon are very grippy and oversteer when you want them to. I say this game requires skill due to the fact that you need to use precision driving to get the fastest lap times. TrackMania has always been about precision driving, and this game is no different. The multiplayer is excellent and it's an enjoyable experience. The only downside I can think for this game would have to be the price.\n\nThis title is well worth the money, but I would wait for a sale to purchase this game.","December 28, 2013","true","161.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.\n\nComplimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.\n\nThis review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.\n\nIn the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you  do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise.

When you hit side railings or hit tiny little rocks on the road it can send you flying for no reason, completely wasting that lap or time trial. NOTE: I had a lot of fun with this game but I must say that Stadium is far more polished and doesn't randomly send you flying off some place.","December 26, 2015","false","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Believe me it is so brain dead, linear and straight-forward. Like trackmania 1, I was expecting 'types' like STUNT where u earn points to win, PLATFORM where least deaths are considered. Looks like those methods go down the drain. Actually I see many games on steam based or inspired on Trackmania 1, and nadeo went with Race and Time Attack only 2 modes in effin trackmania. This game also taught me to listen to the reviews and not buy the game blindly. Disappointed!","April 22","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The improved graphics and visual damage system are spectacular and just what the series needed. The only downsides that I found are that the UI id a little confusing and the game should've come bundeled with stadium and valley like how the original had desert, swamplands, and snow. Sunrise also had city, mediteranian ,and tropics.\n\nSummary: 9/10 but should be bundeled with valley and staduim","June 3, 2014","true","43.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
