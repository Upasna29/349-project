Decent game, but nothing new. Pre-load jump, do trick, get boost, go faster. It controls well enough with a controller. Mild customizing options but nothing special, only affects stats a little. For the $17.99 it's ok, for $10 or less is a good deal.\n\nUPDATE: Ok, so the more I play this game the more I'm enjoying it. Definately nothing that hasn't been done before BUT this games strikes a fine balance between many racing game conventions. Going fast and hitting jumps is a blast as is handling the ATV. I bought this game because ATV racing is awesome when done right. This game nails it. Original review still stands but this games polish is continuing to shine through the small annoyances.","October 6, 2014","true","24.7"," 90 of 114 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","90","114","2","4"

This game has some of the most abyssmall loading times I've ever encountered on a pc-port..\n\nBefore I start the somewhat justified bashing, I think I need to disclose some.. Important information to consider.\n\nMy Desktop computer has the highest capacity I7 in it that I could get. (3770k 3,50ghz) And it had some problems loading the game.. To work with the I7 I have a GTX760. Now I'm not sure whether or not this is because of my setup, or does the game actually have some optimization problems.. Currently I'm leaning towards the latter option.\n\nJust so I could get a good comparison, I dug up the old bundle-copy of PURE that came with my XBOX360 way back when. I put that into the console and played it and it ran great, short loading times, much clearer hud and promps, everything.\n\nHere's a little list of comparisons regarding the major problem with the PC-Port, the loading times:\n\nXBOX360\n\n-Load to title screen: 5s\n-Loading to a menu: 4-5s\n-Loading to a level: 10-15s\n[on average]\n\nPC-Port\n\n-Load to title screen: 2min- 3min\n-Loading back to menu: 2.30min - 3min\n-Loading to a level: 2.30min – 3.30min\n[on average]\n\nTo further justify the optimization argument. After I put Youtube running on my second monitor, the loading times seemed to halve.\n\n-Loading back to menu: 40s +\n-Loading to a level: 1min +\n\nAnd taking a look at my taskmanager, it looked like the cpu cores worked more evenly after I put something running in the backround.\n\nEDIT: And that CPU problems only happens with PURE, forgot to mention that before.\n\n\nMore things to nag about with the pc-port, are the somewhat badly done controller options.\nI thought that they would have the smarts to just put the xbox-pad promps onto the screen when a pad is detected, but no.. There are no promps of the 360-pad when you play the game with one, it took me a day to figure out how to do the special-tricks. The only way i figured that out, was when I took a look at the manual of the 360-version. Which at least explained everything well..\nFurthermore, there seems to be no ”show manual” option on my library page for this game.\nA petty quible yes, considering you can read the list of the controls from within the game (Which does not show how to do the specials). Oh, and I just noticed that there is no mouse support. So the game only works with a keyboard, if you don't have a gamepad.\n\nBut is the game good despite the somewhat hamfisted porting?  Yes, yes it is.\nFor a racing game it's great, although they do recycle the locations to death. There are no problems with the co ntrols, framerate or anything else. Besides the loading times. If they would take the time to do some optimization on that part the game would be more enjoyable.\n\nThe graphical style seems to be the same as on 360, the only added thing seems to be a post-processing option. The graphical quality seems to be very similiar, the only noticeable differences are with the hud and the lack of 360pad promps on the PC-port.\n\nUrgh.... Can I recommend this game?\n\nYes, it is the same as on 360.\nYes, it runs great. Disregarding the loading times.\nYes, it is enjoyable.\n\nLet's say, that I can recommend this game. If you can stomach the horrid load-times. BUT, I would only recommend it when it goes on sale. 20€ is a bit too steep of a price, it would be cheaper to go and find a second-hand copy of the 360-version and play that..\n\nFor those who need a fast fix of racing for their day, I would not recommend it untill they optimize the loading times more...\n\n\nEdit:\n\nIt looks like the studio that worked on this game, has stopped being a thing. And there will be no tech support for this game. I took a short foray into PCgamingWiki and there was no page for this game.. So, i think the loading time problem will not be solved anytime soon...\n\n\nEdit 2:\n\nMy Antivirus blocked the games start a few times, after it had finally decided that the game was of no threath to the computer the loading times did improve. Almost to the level of the xbox.\n\nI dismissed this at first since it always had the tendency to go mental with certain games, my apologies regarding that.\n\nThanks to Mendel for noting that out.\n\n\n\nPS. It would be nice if STEAM would add a "Neutral" option into the review page.. Would make writing these a bit better.","December 7, 2014","true","8.0"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","12"

But ONLY if you are dying in love with ATVs of any kind. There are too little games on this cluster, and PURE surely not the worst of them.\nFor everyone else though, Including racing games fans, I'd vouch to stay calm, even if you see it with some big discount.\nReally, even with Steam cards, I don't recommend the game for more than 1-2$. Get Nailed instead, it works better for the most cases.\n\nPro points:\n+ Awesome soundtrack!\n+ Good enough racing tracks\n+ for a 2008 game, quite nice visuals (except for bugs, like I had, with disappearing hands of driver or some other graphic artefacts)\n\nContra points:\n- controls are best suited for XBOX controller, it is somewhat tricky to get along with keyboard+mouse\n- many visual bugs, even after the game was tuned along with all manuals available.\n- the feel of track is only visual - like your clothes getting dirty or the sand gushes out of wheels... but you'll not feel that sand like a hurdle of some kind. Water will slow you down a little, but, all in all, the contact with different terrains could be performed much better - and that's a strong disadvantage point even for quite arcade PURE experience\n\nConclusion:\nThe game felt much better on the XBOX 360. The PC port is not quite well optimised, and the whole game theme of performing stunts on ATVs... Could be entertaining, but probably not for long. For the most of gamers auditory, they find enough of ATVs in San Andreas blessed land.\nMy mark is 6/10. Buy it only if you have real rush for that kind of visual experience.","February 16","true","22.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Ok, you get your steer&lean stick, you get gas and brakes, then you get boost, pre-load (a special boost just for jumps), 4 different buttons to do 4 different levels of aerial tricks (in conjunction with the stick), and one more button to tweak said tricks. If you've been counting, you'll have noticed that we're now out of buttons, and in fact the pre-load feature requires using the steering joystick button.\n\nIt feels pretty solid otherwise, but I don't believe I'm going to want to sort all of these buttons out.  Also, annoyingly long load times. XP compatibility mode seems to help. The game does install a manual in its game directory.\n\nNote that the game has multiplayer (LAN and online), and there you can alledgedly start levels in a free-roam mode where your stunts will be tallied, but you don't have any objectives, so you can sort of just hang out and do stuff.\n\nI consider PURE as an extra to Split/Second, because you pay a little more to get both games in a package than you would for one alone, and being on sale and all, it was worth upgrading to the double package to get it, but I wouldn't have bought it on its own. Barely recommended.\n\n\nP.S.: Note that the game is using F12 to browse through some selections.

It's an early game from the past X360/PS3 generation, one of the mandatory starter titles and despite that I must say it's really well made and fun to play even after all these years. I have about 20 hours pumped into it offsteam (bought it here years after when it was really sale just so I have a "respect buy" copy here), and I couldn't see the end of it. No rush, really, you can pull it out anytime and have fun, there are no disposable forced storylines pushed on you (*cough*NFS*cough*) or anything, just build your ride, and have arcade fun with it in the dirt.\n\nThe PC port has some issues you can quickly fix (such as starting in horribly low resolution and you must do the quite lengthy tutorials before having access to the main menu to change it) and the loading screens are just massive for some reason, for the latter... you must get used to that.\n\nThe controls are somewhat weird because you control 3 different things at the same time (your ride, complexity level of tricks you want to do, and direction/side of the trick) simultainously, but don't just give up straight away, this is the mentioned complexity of the game also the core reason of it being awesome.","January 5","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Controls are so complicated it's hard to use a USB controller. Makes you go through a stupid tutorial before letting you race. Also, what the heck is a "preload."","October 28, 2014","false","0.6"," 10 of 84 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","10","84","0","0"

Decided to purchase on Steam. No regrets... Although, if you switch the type from keyboard to controller, the guy says "Press the spacebar" ...Uh... okay. No. I'm using this *holds up controller*.\n\nLogitech F310 works just fine for this game. The loading times can be a bit longer than usual, but most people are exaggerating the load times "Ooooohh.. it just takes an eternity." "Oh, it won't start up." You didn't do it right, you poor sap. Downloaded, restarted pc as per usual, installed & played just fine.\n\n9/10 for being an excellent game, -1 for stuff.","December 25, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
