You are controlling the ship by moving the head. So far so good and nothing new, but using the Oculus Rift (seated of course) it is nearly impossible to reach the upper doors, coins or addons. There needs to be a sensitivity option for the OR headset or just change the way you steer to where you look instead of how you move your head.\n\nNot recommended for Oculus Rift users.","May 18","false","0.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Driving a ship by moving the head is not fun.\nAll I want is to play using my joystick and be immersed in the cockpit. But you can't either be in the cockpit and look around or control the ship using regular control.

Though as to be expected with recent releases, there is a plethora of bugs and issues with the menu system; from options not triggering any changes within the game, to purchases not updating within in the store and achievements not being unlocked, this game needs some serious refinement before it is worth it's $10 asking price.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is really well made and a lot of fun, if you can look past these issues present within the rest of the game, it is a good way to pass the time, that's if the game continues to give you xp for completing missions, in my case, I'm stuck at the same level forever now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/357010/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","I also covered this game on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn_TGvCSOBU\n\nDisclosure: I was provided a review code for this title by the developer's PR company.\n\nDespite it's Wing Commander-esque appearance, this is actually a more casual runner style game that happens to take place in space. While it's systems and mechanics are pretty basic and shallow, there's actually a lot of content and challenge here.\n\nThe only things you control in The Collider 2 is your ship's position and whether or not your boost is active. Shooting takes place automatically when necessary and you can't stop or even slow down. The challenge comes from having to skillfully manipulate these two simple mechanics very quickly to stay ahead of the levels rushing toward you.\n\nThe Collider 2 has two modes, a mission-based mode where you go through a series of missions ranging from time attack to item collection to target destruction and an endless score attack mode. The variety in mission mode is a bit lacking but there are a large number of levels available and they start to get very challenging very quickly. It will likely take you a number of hours to get through everything. The endless mode puts you in a never-ending, randomly generated level where you are scored not only on how long you survive but how much you boost as well. Your goal is simply to survive as long as possible and to try to reach the highest position on the online leaderboards.\n\nThere is also currency in the game that you can use to buy new ships, upgrades to their base abilities, cosmetic paint jobs and extensions to the length of the various powerups you'll encounter in the levels. Where this game excels over similar titles like TRON RUN/r is that you can't buy your way to better positions on the leaderboards by spending real money. Despite the presence of in-game currency, you can only earn it in the game, there are no microtransactions whatsoever. Not only is this title much cheaper to buy than TRON RUN/r but it's a much more balanced playing field. Yes, those with more upgrades can get higher on the leaderboards more easily but you can earn that same preference yourself just by playing the game. This is how it should be.\n\nThe Collider 2 is mechanically simple but looks quite visually striking. I don't have a VR headset and can't speak to its native VR support but others have said it's pretty good and this makes for a nice value add. The only problem is that at least in the initial version, controllers (which are the optimal but not only way to play) occasionally stop responding on menus and require you to move to another menu with the mouse before getting control back. This could be easily patched and I hope it is.\n\nIf you're not into endless runner games or are expecting a more in-depth story-based space shooter, this is not for you. However, it's a very nice package with a good amount of content for a reasonable price and I've been having a surprising amount of fun with it. It's a great game to just fire up in short bursts when you don't have a lot of time for a bigger gaming session.","April 21","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
