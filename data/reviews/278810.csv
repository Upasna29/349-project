It's how I got tricked into buying it.\n\nThis got very boring within (EDIT: apparantly, only 0.9 ) hours. I gave it two play sessions. Didn't realize how short they were because I just wasn't having a good enough time. You never need to use the buddy cop system, as your AI controlled partner is unreliable and often just gets gunned down. Beating missions gives you xp you can use to level up any cop you want, and you can just max out all skills on whichever one you choose. So, there's no real reason to ever choose any other cops once you've picked two. Also, the levels are all samey. You kill waves of enemies (or arrest them as they come around corners) until you get to a checkpoint. Rinse, repeat. It's not as fun as Hotline Miami, which several positive reviews have compared it to. Save your money and look at getting something else.\n\nAlso, there isn't really any storyline. If you're going to get this game, wait for it to go on a huge sale (like 75% off).","March 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 371 of 471 people (79%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","79","371","471","22","16"

Thugs get harder to kill and have better aim at later levels and this removes the strategy aspect of the game. The game has no real AI all of the thugs just run at you and try to shoot at some distance depending on how hard the level should be. The "story" is uninteresting and not engaging at all. You have to grind levels and doing the first mission a thousand times is the best way to do it, which is boring as hell. If you like grinding and grinding just to keep playing a game then this is the perfect game for you, but I regret buying it because it gets repetitive really fast.\n\nSince I agree with almost everything TotalBiscuit says in this video, here's a link to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hY-BorzPoM","March 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 169 of 209 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","169","209","6","0"

It's shared from that account and I jumped on on here to try one last time and to be able to post my thoughts.\n\nIt would be fairly unfair of me to assign a review score to LA Cops just yet. I haven't made it to the end and probably never will if things don't change in a significant manner. Fortunately, a developer from the team making the game responded to some of my ranting on Twitter and assures me that at least one thing will be fixed; that nagging sensation that any game that has a player control two characters should have a co-op mode. They are adding a co-op mode. They're also working on the AI and I've suggested various other solutions to current problems but it remains to be seen what happens. Needless to say, co-op mode and a second player would probably be the best fix.\n\nNow, let me explain to you why this is important. Beneath the colorful, 70's exterior, beneath all of the ridiculous humor thrown in about cop stereotypes, is an extremely frustrating game. There are a few reasons for this but the primary of them is the partner AI and the way you control him or her. Your partner can only be controlled by commanding him or her to go to a specific location. There is absolutely no way to control which way they face, other than to attempt to continuously re-position them so that they stop walking while facing in the direction that you want them to. This is important because the partner AI is currently so dimwitted that they won't interact with anything outside of their cone of sight, no matter how loud or threatening the approaching AI are.\n\nThis is all well and good, a bit obnoxious but it can be worked around. What can't is the fact that the game is heavily dependent upon locking onto targets. The enemy AI has extremely good aim and will almost certainly kill you within a shot or two if you don't get them first. Here's the problem with that. You have to control your other player with the crosshair. Locking on locks the crosshair to the nearest enemy. You can't cycle through enemies to lock onto. So how are you supposed to control your partner well while simultaneously locking on?\n\nWell, you don't, really. A good breach is easily shot down by the fact that setting your partner up and then swinging back and locking on is an insanely difficult thing to do. Cycling through targets would at least make it easier, if not a perfect solution. But then comes a new problem. So you've killed the two that were in the room. Three more are charging you from another room after hearing gunfire. Do you take them on yourself or risk trying to finagle your partner into a good, tactical position. In my experience, both of those are losing ideas. I've repeated the same scenarios upwards of ten times and only finally completed them through what seemed like pure, unadulterated luck.\n\nTherein lies the problem, and this isn't even including the oversensitive controller settings that fling your crosshair the other way when you let go of the joystick and take all of the nuance out of aiming, forcing you to stick with a equidistant circle that you can aim on. The second character is near useless, barring guarding a door or serving as a chance at redemption when you hear the all-too-often "cop down" and the challenges are balanced for being able to accurately maneuver two cops. I would have loved to have been able to draw a path for the AI and tell them when to move out in an almost Rainbow Six-like manner. That could have been a brilliant experience. As it stands, though, it's just too difficult, even on normal, to trudge through it, and most of the fault for that lies with the AI and the way that you control them.","March 16, 2015","false","0.8"," 62 of 82 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","62","82","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/recommended/278810/","Ottomic","Ottomic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/","282 products in account","LA Cops does the rare thing of combining the worst of Hotline Miami and the worst of Resident Evil 5 without any of the positives.\n\nI was kinda interested in this game, seeing how it looked like a 2-character tactical shooter. Looked a bit like HM in that it had quiet planning moments interrupted by bursts of gun action. Seemed okay, so I picked up on the sale.\n\nThe game looks good, the game does an okay job of telling you the controls, the difficulty curve is reasonable. However LA Cops is hindered by a series of absolutely baffling design choices that run what should be a fun tactical romp into a completely frustrating, sluggish, wasted oportunity of a game. Here are my main gripes with it:\n\n- When using keyboard for the first time, you'll get the impression that the game is designed to be played with a controller, since there seems to be a sticky aim, movement with the WASD keys is a bit unresponsive and the angles can be kinda weird. However, playing it with a gamepad you'll get the impression that the game was designed for KBM, because the reticle is used for things such as moving your partner around or selecting the sticky aim, but on controller mode you can only make the reticle move in a predetermined radius around your character. So no matter how you play it, you'll be unconfortable.\n\n- Sticky aim doesn't stick to the enemy you want it to stick to. Rather, it will stick to whichever it feels like. This is especially annoying when you're trying to tag an enemy right after telling your buddy to burst in killing everyone, which will result in you failing to tag the enemy and finally just shoot wildly in their general direction which, considering how chaotic combat can get in the game, will probably get your partner, you, or both, killed.\n\n- There is no allied AI. You're supposed to be a team of cops, but the only thing your partner will do is stand in place and act as a turret. You will have to tell him/her, EVERY TIME, where to move next. Which, in a game where teamwork and covering each other's backs seems so important, feels even weirder of a mechanic. The game actually kinda picks up when you're left with just one cop, and the mere inclusion of a "follow me" command would have turned it into a game *heaps* more pleasant. Enemy AI, when it works, will consist on running up to you, standing there, and shoot. Straightforward, but lacking.\n\n- You can't seem to switch cops, despite the prompt telling you to press R to do so. The only time I've been able to switch between my cops is when one of them "dies".\n\n- AI will derp out, sometimes your buddy will run past an enemy that's shooting him/her, sometimes the goon will ignore them, sometimes they'll get stuck on a door, sometimes will hear stuff they shouldn't be able to hear, and sometimes will not pay attention to something that's happening 5 feet from them. That obviously compounds to the "I won't move if you don't tell me to" friendly AI issue mentioned above.\n\n- You can't scroll past the boundaries of the screen to check the rest of the map. There is a minimap, which is not explained, and you can zoom out, but you can't see what's a bit further than what's centered on your character, making planning and awareness kinda moot since there's gonna be people coming from places you can't possibly know.\n\n- Restarts affect to your score, which kinda bugs me.\n\nSo, to sum up: it controls weird, it is tedious, both enemies and allies hinder the game flow even further, some expected features half work, others are directly absent from it. My advice is to actually play it before you buy it, because despite looking slick and entertaining, for me it has been an exercise in frustration and unpleasantness.\n\n4/10.","June 24, 2015","false","0.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","25","30","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FfsShenPls/recommended/278810/","FfsShenPls","YOU LOOKED INTO MY EYES!!!!!!!!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FfsShenPls/","134 products in account","Bad game if you can even call it a game.\n\nCompletely based on random chance. Enemies can sometimes shoot you through walls that cannot be shot through. They can also turn around when you are sneaking up behind them, taking half your health or instantly killing you with no attack animation. AI is so bad that they will ignore compatriots being shot or apprehended in the same room as them. Or, if you are unlucky, come across the map while you are still working through the level and jump you. Your partner will sometimes ignore enemies and be shot dead, or sometimes just aimbot them in a random 5 second spurt of pseudo-intelligence.\n\nWeapons are bad. The uzi sound is deceptive, making it by far the worst weapon in the game to use, but extremely deadly in the hands of AI who aimbot you. All weapons shoot at the same speed, with enough accuracy to snipe off-screen enemies. Yes that means you will be fishing around the edges of your screen, waiting for your crosshair to turn red. Then you click to fire your weapon, and you will see your score go up. The game takes no skill or strategy, it is just completely broken. There is a gun that turns your partner into a pile of gibs so they can't be revived essentially making certain levels like the last one impossible. Speaking of score, isn't it supposed to be a cop game? Why is there no penalty for killing civilians?\n\nGame pace is done poorly. The only way to stay on top of enemies is to snipe them from off the screen like I explained before they can shoot back. Otherwise you will be overrun by 6+ shotguns and uzis that are all capable of killing you instantly. You can do the same to them, but they will be surrounding you and more often than not, standing behind objects that can't be shot through unless you're at the perfect angle they are at. While writing this review I died in a loading screen two times so it's definitely not a coincidence. This is an artifact of poor coding. The game state exists even when there is a ♥♥♥♥ing loading screen. Hello???? Why?\n\nThe camera angle is bad no matter what because the UI will block you and the field of view is tiny except on levels that don't even need the zoom out. Enemies see you before you see them and don't make any sound until they are already attacking you. Most of the time you will just hear them shooting at you and then a half second later yell about donuts. Also, you can't effectively kill enemies while changing the camera angle. Bad control scheme, not thought out well at all. Not thought out, period.\n\nArt style is bad, it is just pixelated groove crap, doesn't remind me of the setting at all. The characters and voice acting sucks. Why do these 70s cops say stuff like "Triple Kill" if you kill 3 guys, why do they say "Cop Down" when you or your partner dies? It's all stupid. Product placement for a fake product is GTA level cringe. The theme is so badly done you will literally be following an objectives tab that tells you "Destroy Drug tables" for most of the game. They could have just made a good game. So much wasted development time. The only thing I like looking at other than the funny donut loading screen is Jo Murphys sexy body. She is really hot and will be my wife this July.\n\nThis game has less than 30 minutes of play to it, but tries to give u more by making you level up. The difference between leveling up and not, is when you start Nightmare difficulty like I did while level 1, you will get 1 shot killed by enemies and need to shoot them 3-4 times. You can cheese all the levels to completion and just level up that way. I never even made it past the halfway point for damage or health by the end of the game, and I was still 2-shotting with all but the assault rifle which is always a one hit kill due to being this game's Godmode Gun. It also got to the point they had to have a shotgun or grenade to kill me in one hit. So it starts out slightly difficult, then it is just really easy. I can't complain since I got it for free in a bundle with Worms but this is not a game worth 15 dollars, it's not worth your time whether you are on a tight schedule or not. Trying to figure out how TEAM 17 went from Worms to this ♥♥♥♥ is mind boggling. Not even the ♥♥♥♥ing achievements work right. What the ♥♥♥♥??\n\nTl;dr\n\nGraphics 5/5 (Just terrible and can't tell what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on half the time but Jo Murphy is one hot momma and my wife\nSound 2/5 (The music is okay. For the first 20 minutes of the same 2 or 3 tracks being looped.)\nControls 0/5 (Bugged to ♥♥♥♥ a pile of ♥♥♥♥, some controls completely broken i.e can't switch to partner unless you die, crosshair disappears when meleeing)\nGameplay 0/5 (Really stupid final boss with a boring "Do this 3 times" mechanic after a boring "Blow up 76 things which take multiple hits to blow up" yes, 76 ♥♥♥♥ing things, stupid ♥♥♥ game)\nDifficulty 0/5 (Game is not skill based. You'll only die because of purely bad luck. Better to restart anyway than deal with a ♥♥♥♥ hand, all the levels are about 2-4 minutes in length if going slowly for the sake of avoiding ♥♥♥♥ing shotguns)\n\nBlam this peice of crap.","December 5, 2015","false","4.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/278810/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor lovers of Hotline Miami there's a lot of potential to be found in LA Cops, even if this early access release is pretty barebones. Yes, all of the agents are already available and the level that's been implemented feels complete. But at the moment it's pretty short and can easily be finished within 30-60 minutes. That number includes repeatedly dying and therefore replaying some of the sections over again. Let's keep in mind that it's an early access title, but I have to be honest, I've seen games with more content than this. Anyway, let's forget about that for a moment and continue with this little review.\n\nLA Cops lets you control 2 cops, in realtime, but you can switch between them on the fly with the press of a button. Your partner won't move along with you; he or she will stand still and cover you as long as enemies move in their FOV. Unlike Hotline Miami this game doesn't entirely rely on fast movement, but you actually have to carefully plan what to do. It requires a bit of strategy and tactics. It's recommended that you let your partner cover the corners so you can let the criminals come to you, if you don't get killed in the process, that is.\n\nThe graphics are cel shaded and look absolutely gorgeous and stylish and have that 70's look that the developers are aiming for. Just excellent. The game really looks 2D but actually is 3D and you can freely move/rotate the camera around.\nI haven't really paid attention to any music, just to some sounds, so I'll have to update my review later with better impressions. Still, the gunshots sounded good and the voice acting was also pretty solid, but limited.\n\nAnd of course, there's plenty of room for improvements: the AI, for example, needs some work. I also frequently got stuck in the doorway/between the doors and got shot that way.\nThe camera is too low/has a funny angle so it's sometimes hard to see. I understand this adds to a tense atmosphere, but it doesn't always work as far as gameplay is concerned. Obviously, real cops also never know what can happen so, again, I understand the choice, but when I stand in a large room with 4 or 5 enemies that I could've easily killed if only the camera gave me more room then, for me, it's a bad choice. Hopefully they'll improve it in the future.\nAlso, the UI is clumsy. If I select an agent I want to instantly see their stats. I don't want to click on another button to just see that. For upgrading them it makes complete sense, but their stats can easily be shown on the character selection screen.\nAnd I also confused the ammo bar with the health bar while playing, but that could also be me not paying enough attention and wanting to just jump in.\n\nAnd yes, we all know this is work in progress and I'm sure lots of things will change in the next couple of months, and lots of stuff will also be added so I can't tell you yet if it will be worth the money, but for now I will absolutely recommend it.\nI'll try and update this review to reflect future changes and additions and that way keep it as accurate as possible.\n\n[Rating: 79/100]","July 31, 2014","true","0.3"," 72 of 123 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","72","123","3","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/278810/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Top-down-view shooter about "good" cops whacking and occasionally arresting some bad mobsters, intriguing by its 70' fuzzy visual style and cover-your-flank-partner mechanics. I'd like to praise that game, I'm really more into upholding law, rather than go frenzy like in the Hotline Miami or Hatred. But at current stage of game development, I really can't vouch for LA Cops. So far it is a broken experience, therefore I suggest you to simply stay aside.\n\nDetails:\n\nVisuals are 70' style, everybody male have mustache or beard, and looks really groovy at first sight. Until you see some "cutscenes", especially with Katsuo. Ever heard some noise about facial animations? There are none. Totally faceless characters. That's the point where fuzzy getting into foul.\n\nThe main problem of the game - is the lack of content. 8 levels of campaign mode can be finished in about hour or two (depends from difficulty level and your luck).\n\nGame mechanics are quite simple: you have a level with rooms infested by gangsters, which you need to storm either by yourself, or with help of your partner on crime scene. So you storm the place, kill or incapacitate mobs, complete some secondary goals like freeing the hostage, or destroying the pile of "drugs". Simple not mean good, though, for its pretty luck-based. The first levels can be opted by planning-before-moving, but, after 3rd level, you'll see a pure roulette: to kill or to be killed... And since the mobs tends to swarm in packs, and shoot through impenetrable walls once they discover your location, with drastic damage and accuracy... You'll be dying alot out of no reason and thanks to bad camera view angles and not working properly control buttons.\n\nThe most anticipated - bugs! First, the controls: for some unobvious reasons you can't switch your cops, until you die on mission. After that buttons seems to work... for some time. But the main irritant right now is the fact that you can't finish the game properly - after you deal with the last main mission, and see the credits, your progress with the Casino mission will be forgotten. That means you can't get achievements for completion of the game.\n\nAlso I've noticed several questionable game design solutions. On the start screen there are only two options, single player or multiplayer. So to quit the game I use Alt+F4. Next dubious thing is that you need to complete every level triple times, since completion on the highest difficulty don't mean you're good with easy and medium difficulties.\n\nConclusion:\nSo far it is not worth any money asked. The amount of content is just slightly more than we had in the demo versions of games not so long ago. Yeah, before they started to sell betas as full-scale games, that is. The whole "Copper" thing is not relevant, you're doing almost the same things as in Hotline Miami, just not so messy. And that is thanks to simplified mechanics, compared with That Another Game. So, to answer the question "Is it a poor man's Hotline Miami?" - I must say that it is a fair assessment.\n\nMy mark now will be 5.3/10. I can revise it some time later, if they fix at least problems with achievements... But now, it is broken piece of unfinished code that could be a decent game, were it made properly Before release and sales.","February 4","false","7.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/recommended/278810/","hemmingjay","Hemmingjay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hemmingjay/","1433 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI LOVE IT! It's a realtime squad based tactical shooter where you can switch between two different cops with the press of a button and the AI takes over the other to shoot but not move. This means you meove your cop into position and face him/her in a direction to cover a doorway or corner and then move the other cop into position, leapfrogging and so on. It makes for fun, tense situations and surprises. Occasionally panicked shootouts occur but most of the time you feel like a badass methodically moving through the building taking out bad guys with one shot. You can pick up their weapons, like shotguns, micro-uzi(semi auto), M79 thumper grenade launcher, M16 assault rifle, and more in the full game I believe. It plays like a combination between a top down/Iso version of Hitman meets Hotline Miami. In fact, It's a LOT like Hotline Miami with two switchable characters. It would be a ton of fun if it was co-op, which I am hoping they find a way to add.\n\nThe art and music are great. The weapons are satisfying to shoot. The AI is pretty decent already with a few rare idiot moments like getting caught on a doorway, but good overall. The polish of design and mission structure is very good.\n\nNow for the bad.......there's not enough of it. Once again an early access game launches with not much more than a proof of concept. I love the game and look forward to it, but I'm not super comfortable with them charging $12 for 1 level of a game that may not get finished if sales aren't decent. I think developers(I am one) need to start being realistic about what they are asking of consumers. Don't ask us to pay full or even half price for a game with less content than a demo that may never be finished. This game once complete would be worth $14 to most of us at most. It will most likely live at $9.99 after it's first month on the market and I feel it should really be priced around that now.\n\nThe one mission included, Level 5 of 9, has four stages and takes about 20 minutes to play through. I can see myself playing through maybe another 3 times if I get bored. That's an hour of gameplay. I spoke to the developer on the forums and they are awesome, open and friendly. They are not hiding anything and have been wonderful in everyway. It is for that reason that I don't regret my purchase and I can recommend the game to you all. The price is subjective.......great game, little content now.....your choice. They did say they hope to have monthly updates.  I can't wait for the full release.","July 30, 2014","true","1.5"," 43 of 82 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","43","82","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAsianBean/recommended/278810/","TheAsianBean","Gato Loco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAsianBean/","22 products in account","LA Cops Review\nPublisher: Team17 Digital Ltd\nDeveloper: Modern Dream\nRelease Date: March 13, 2015\n\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics in this game are quite good overall, with clean 3D looks, and retro 70’s feel this game nails it. One of the biggest flaws that I noticed was in certain rooms the floor had lines that confused me and looked like walls, causing me to get shot. The destruction is nice with particles when objects and NPC’s get shot, and colors are bright and vibrant. With a steady 60FPS occasionally dropping to mid 50’s during cut scenes, the overall look and feel of this game is very good.\n\n\nGameplay\nThis is a very well playing top down game, it is a quick game to pick up and learn, and the tutorial is very fast and easy. The game is fairly well balanced but occasionally an enemy who is faced the opposite way will turn around and kill you immediately. The lock on system is easy to use and works well, but I find it unnecessary as it is smoother to just point and aim.The mini-map is pointless, made small and shoved into the corner, I find myself forgetting it’s even there. The weapons are well balanced and designed. The NPC is either half brain dead or Einstein, when it comes to finding where you are. The missions and cut scenes are funny and entertaining enough to keep me enjoying the game. Overall the game is quite enjoyable and is very funny, but is not very entertaining the second time around.\n\n\nControls\nThe controls are decent, with the aiming and lock-on system being this games forte. The viewing controls are great with easy to use zooming and rotation of the camera, it is easy to see big parts of the map so that you can plan out your next move. The only thing I didn’t care for was the movement system, the WASD movement system is setup in a way that W is always up and accordingly for the other keys. Normally in a top-down this is no problem at all, but this game’s maps are oriented very diagonally making it challenging to move in the way you want to, leaving you vulnerable and open to enemy fire.\n\n\nStory\nThe story is funny and entertaining, with the cut scenes being my favorite parts, this will keep you intrigued though the whole story. With a theme of 70’s cops in LA doing crazy jobs from hold ups to drug deals, and music to match, the story is very well laid out. My only complaint being that it is a very short 8 levels.\n\n\nAchievements\nWith only 13 quick and easy achievements, the game seemed somewhat short. Though a few were a challenge to get.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall, I think this was a very fun and entertaining game, with good graphics and a well thought out story, I found this to be quite a good game. With an original purchase price of $14.99 on Steam, I would wait to get a sale on the game as I don’t feel it is wholly worth that price.\n","February 15","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If i was able to switch i would take the other char and run into the room with full health.\nAlso you can switch weapons, but only on your active character, since you cannot change you have to let one die to get access to the weapons lying around for the other char... but then you revive your partner and he has his basic gun again and you cannot change that weapon again...\n\nso in my eyes this is a gamebreaker...\nfixing this would let me at least recommend the game for single player use; for multiplayer i can already recommend it, and it's best both players use a controller (x360) to play the game.","December 4, 2015","false","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let's break it down shall we\n\n\n=======\nThe Good\n=======\n\n- Idea/ Theme - The idea of playing a old style L.A cop in a top down shooter is a interesting idea.\n\n- Graphics - I do enjoy the graphics/looks of it, it's not over the top and doesn't feel awkard or painful to look at. Some might see this different but I do enjoy the look of it\n\n\n=======\nThe bad\n=======\n\n- Friendly A.I - Having played this on the most recent version at the time of this review, I have to say the A.I is still bad, my partner can only shoot within a radius about maybe 5m in a cone shape, if he is shot from behind he will take forever to turn around leading to his death. If a enemy is using a rifle and stands just outside the cone he will kill my partner. If my partner is in a tight corner of a room, he will get stuck and won't return fire if the enemy is in his face. I was hoping with the leveling system that the more you level the better radius my partner can see, better reaction and so forth...sadly that isn't here and most times I find I have to hide my partner and use them whenever I need a quick heal.\n\n- Enemy A.I - The enemy A.I is 50/50 sometimes they will shoot through a corner that even you don't have the angle to shoot from, they sometimes get stuck on doors, blindly charge to your location (was hoping they would take cover or call for help or something) and sometimes they don't shoot even if they are 2 steps away (found that when they have the grenade launcher they just charge until they are 1 step away from you...it's rather strange.\n\n- Civillans - Down the road you will meet some friendly npcs however they just run around screaming asking for help, I found myself charging them to secure them hoping to put cuffs on them or escort them out so they are both out of my way and score maybe some points...I found this doesn't exist and most missions I find the enemy shooting through them without damaging the civillans meanwhile they would eat my bullets and charging me -200 points on my score.  They become annoying as you want to avoid shooting them but find yourself in the position of saying hell with it and killing everyone in sight just to be over with it.\n\n-Combat/Controls- Sometimes I found aiming and shooting not responding correctly. I was aiming at one enemy close range and my character somehow aimed above the enemy's head and at a bookcase behind him...this is even using the lock on feature and having a max character. I find this happening a few times throughout my playthrough.\n\n\n======\nThe Mix\n======\n\n- Story - It's ok for what it is but didn't feelt excited or interested really\n\n- Missions - the missions are rather straight forward, you have 8 story plus a few extra side missions, this you can blow through pretty fast especially if your a hotline player as you will find this so much easier to fly through. If you haven't then you might face some trouble now and then at certain points but it's very easy to get by once you figure out the routine and camping spots. Most missions within the story are clear, hold out and destroy a few items with the odd boss now and then.\n\n- Leveling system - Neat to have a little leveling system in which you improve your character's speed , damage and even loadout. However you can't hold a secondary weapon when carrying a large weapon, I found this annoying as most police type games will allow you to carry a secondary and primary helping solve ammo issues. Not sure why they choose this way but I found myself running into large rooms of enemy and running out of ammo forcing to charge with the melee attack...oh yeah they be afraid of my handcuffs alright :P\n\n\n\n=====\nOverall\n=====\n\nIt's something neat to play around with or if your wanting some quick easy achievements however I would wait for a sale as there isn't much replay value, I know the devs have been adding improvements and adding missions but at the moment and with most players coming from Hotline, they will feel like this is nothing and burn through the content way too fast to make it worth the full price.","April 8, 2015","false","4.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Unfortunately I didn't find the game fun at all for several reasons.\n\nLet's do the good stuff first. The game looks and sounds great, the presentation is spot on and the writing is fun. The game is a Hotline Miami clone with an isometric view, with the addition of a second character you can give limited orders to and swap over when you're shot down, which adds a lot to the run and gun formula when it works.\n\nAs for the bad...\n\nThe AI is atrocious and worse still, completely inconsistent. Enemies tend to walk in slow circles, grinding stoically against walls until they complete their trajectory. They walk by obliviously by downed and arrested comrades, and sometimes they miss a gunfight going on in the same room. But sometimes they don't, and come running from a couple of rooms over.\nSimilarly, you can issue your partner an order to stand by, and she'll fire at anything that comes into her line of sight - the problem is you can position her, but you can't tell her were to aim, so it often takes a lot of fiddling to set up an ambush (which is one of the things that would make the game awesome if it worked properly).\n\nThe isometric presentation is also a huge problem. There's a reason why Hotline Miami is top-down, and this game illustrates that beautifully. Lining up shots is a huge pain; I think you're meant to rely on the lock-on option, but that also causes problems, since its implementation basically sucks. Instead of sticking to the enemy closest to your reticle, it... well, it seems to do whatever the hell it wants to. Which usually means that while a maniac is running at you with a shotgun, you're stuck aiming at an oblivious target through two walls.\nThe stylized presentation also often makes lines of sight unclear - is this grey gap rubble or a hole in the floor? can enemies see me through this?\n\nFinally, technical issues galore! From the off I had a ton of problems - the game doesn't run fullscreen at my 16:10 monitor resolution, The key to swap partners just doesn't work, "kill x number of enemy" achievements got stuck for me and my DS4 controller just won't work properly with it (the first game I've had problems with.) All of these may be due to a problem on my end, and the sort of thing I'd forgive an indie game for. Still, doesn't help.\n\nIf it feels I'm bringing up Hotline Miami too much, well, this game makes no bones about being indebted to it. But in trying to imitate (what I consider) a masterpiece, LA Cops shows just how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ talent and thought went into creating its inspiration. In HM... well, I won't say all deaths always feel fair, but they are always fun; not so here. I stuck with the game, trying to enjoy it, until timed missions and "monster closets" made their appearance, and enemies became a bit more bullet-spongey. At which point I gave up; And it's a shame, because I really wanted to like it.\n\nWell, crap. I hate giving an indie game a bad review. As always with this sort of thing, this is just my opinion, I might just be crap at the game, etc. etc. However, if you're still tempted do have in mind that unless the last couple of missions are way larger than the first six or so, the game is pretty light on content.\n\n(I wasn't able to play the game with a controller.

LA Cops isn't bad, BUT it isn't fantastic YET either. The game has always shown some promise, but it has took it's time proving it. I'm a big fan of top-down shooters - my all time favourite being Hotline Miami, as well some road-based ones, like Death Skid Marks. LA Cops is the soul definition of Early Access. I owned this when it was fresh in development, and it has improved alot! It's mechanics are greatly improved. At one point of owning it, I thought the developers had bailed! But thankfully, I was mistaken. :)\n\nI'm going to give the game a thumbs up, because I have seen this improvement for myself, gameplay and it's coding (achievements FINALLY working...). But it does have a long way to go. Namely depth of story, charm and some polishing up with smoothness of gameplay. It's no Hotline Miami, but then again, nothing ever will be. And who's to say the team behind this even want to be a clone of HM?!\n\nAnyway, here's some words of warning...\n\nBuy this at your own risk - afterall, it's an early access game! What are you expecting? A game in development to run before it can walk?\nBuy this game on a price drop - this saves your own disappointment, if you buy this on discount and don't enjoy it, well it's better than being £11 down, at least you got it for less.\nAnd finally, simply way and see. The game has had some bad press, and negative reviews on here, but you never know what's next! But don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nHere's my best selling point. LA Cops = Beastie Boys "Sabotage" - The Game.","March 16, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","0"

The brutality reminds of Syndicate mixed with Hotline Miami with a 70's cop movie or TV show.\n\nGraphically it took me off guard because I thought isometric strategy but it isn't that at all! You can rotate the camera and the game plays real time. You can position one cop and control the other to create surprise attacks for the enemy. I played with my XBOX360 controller and once I had figured out the controls it felt smooth. Also the character names and designs are pure gold. The AI is good for an early build as well.

It was too short. But the Devs have quickly fixed this within a month, and now there is some 5 20min levels. The game itself is amazing. You control 2 cops, move them both around and all, by switching in between them at will. The gameplay is satisfiying,the story is kinda...weird, but the levels are all great and will make you want to play them again and again.\nAlso, the game has tons of nostolgia behind it. Plenty of referances Hawaii 5-0, Batman, and old TV shows, which, to this day, I enjoy more then anything else.\nThis game is a must buy for 70's cop show lovers, and if you're not, well, wait for a sale or just buy it right away, because,well,its pretty good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts short, maybe 30 mins. But god its brilliant. Spot on gameplay, amazing music, and its just...brilliant...\nThat being said, the reason I gave it a thumbs down is because it will only last 30 mins at most. If your looking for a game to hold you off until Hotline 2, this is it. Just wait a bit longer. $12 is a lot for 30 mins\nOk, ill post this here again.\nChuck G Nukem Givn awy Hitmn Abs Just now\n@Aron\nI know that.
