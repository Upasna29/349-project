Here's the deal.  I just finished what there is of early access in about 2.5 hours, and I received two phone calls during my play that totalled at least 30 minutes.  What this means is that for $15 USD, you'll only be getting about two hours worth of content until more content is released as the development continues on this game through its early access period.  Please keep in mind that I bought this game on it's first day of early access launch and that there may more much more content available by the time you are reading this review.  (The early access launch date for this game was October 7, 2015)\n\nWhat this is available is plenty fun and the graphics are of a cartoony but very nice style that I like quite a bit.  There are some things I like and things I would love to see added to this game from what I've experienced so far in the first couple of hours on early access launch day...\n\nPart 2 (of 4):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUg5OTFPN38\n\nWhat I like:\n\n- Very nice graphics with smooth textures that draws you into the world.\n- Smooth animations and fluid movement controls\n- Nice story, though it does seem to be of typical RPG fashion.. the same kind of story that we've all seen and can predict 1,000 times before.  ..Still, it's a fun and well done story.\n- The combat engages you and requires much more skill and involvement then typical turn based RPG games.  This one is very action oriented and I love that!\n- The music is very peaceful and nice\n\nWhat I'd love to see:\n\n- This RPG game lacks a skill progession system at the current time and there's no way to upgrade skills or stats at any time, even after you level up it's all automatic\n- An RPG game without loot?  UGH.  No inventory?  UGH.  No cool weapons and armor and potions and junk loot to pawn at a shopkeeper in town?  Major UGH!  Please add all of this to this game please!  I want gold and loot galore!\n- No ability to select a class, profession or even change what you look like.  While this isn't a requirement, it would be nice to be able to have a few options even if they have no bearing on the story of the game.\n- Game currently on its launch day of early access is way too short!  I want more!!\n\nHere is Part 3 (of 4):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMK4TrmyoeE\n\nSo, as you can see from the lists above.. this game is easy enough to like and have fun with for what it does offer, I really just want to see so much more!  Mainly more content right now because I was enjoying it and want to see more of this story!  And I really want to able able to get loot and weapons and armor and have an inventory like any other RPG game!  Being able to upgrade skills and choose new attacks at level up etc is also something that really feels like it's missing right now.\n\nWhether or not the developers have any intention of adding anything that I want to see is unknown to me at the moment.  What I can say is that this game is nice, but until it offers more content then it current does on early access launch day (October 7, 2015), most people might want to hold off with their purchase.  I like it so far alright, but want to see more story content as well as more classic RPG loot and progression added soon.\n\nHere is Part 4 of 4:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81UNTUIQSuQ\n\n\nHere is my ratings at this point:\n\nVALUE:  15/40  This score could be so much higher if only we had more content and if there were more skills and progession like skill points and if there was loot and gear to choose from and shops to buy and sell it.  Just more content in the story to make this a 6 or 8 or 10 hour game would help my value score as well.  Right now, it's just too little for your dollar in my opinion, even though what is there now is fun.\n\nFUN:  25/30  I can't knock this important aspect of my scoring table.  This game is really fun right now, even though once you master the combat it gets a little tedious.  But isn't almost any RPG kinda like that?  I like it right now.. just wish there was more conent and depth.\n\nCONTROLS & BUGS:  20/20  For an early access game, this game plays without even a hitch.  You can change your controls layout now to whatever you prefer and it works very fluid and smoothly.\n\nGRAPHICS & SOUND: 10/10  A very nice art style and sound/music for a low budget RPG.  This one is an easy 10.\n\nTOTAL SCORE ON EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH DAY:  70% (70 out of 100)  This score will likely only go up as the development continues for this game thoughout its early access.  More content will only increase the value score which is by far the lowest score on this EA launch day.\n\n\nI hope this all helps you make a decision!","October 7, 2015","true","2.7"," 34 of 50 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","34","50","4","1"

This game is now in early access, but the looks are very promising. The story is quite interesting and deep, the dialogues are similar to JRPG games' style. The control system is good enough, it shouldn't create any problem for you, but for now a combat is not too good (Soon this will be improved as the developer is planning to do some updates). Graphics at the moment are not the best, but in the future this also may change, however a graphic style is promising. Sounds and especially the music is good, it really creates an enjoyable and pleasant atmosphere.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+puzzles\n+good sounds and music\n+nice graphic style\n+good enough story\n+promising development\n\n-at the moment not much content\n-early access\n\nThis game has a big potential so you should keep your eyes on this. For this moment game is enough on early stages so it does not have too much content, but for the time being it also has some good points, for example the story and music.","December 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","26","37","0","0"

It made me feel like playing Twilight Princess, but on PC.\n\nThe combat might be a little challenging at the beginning, the target system seemed kinda buggy to me and after some practice, i noticed i could handle enemies better without targeting them. It works fine when you have just one enemy left, though.\n\nAlso, i highly recommend changing your "Evade" key (alt) for Middle mouse button. It just feels better for some reason, i can react faster that way.\n\nThe game is fairly playable and even enjoyable even though i had a very low FPS in my computer, even with minimal settings, Maybe it's just because i have an old computer, but other source games run fine here. I wish there was an option to disable sunlights.\n\nThe enviroment is nice. I specially loved the caves and the grandpa puzzle area. Nice work.\n\nThe characters and NPC are well made as well. Although some of their dialog artworks could be a little better. Their eyes specially.\n\nNow the game wont let me play past the Sword in the middle of the forest with grandpa's voice. I get this error everytime:\nCUtlStreamBuffer::Close() Write (null) failed 31362 != 76695.\n\nNot sure if it's a bug or something on my computer. I'll google about it later after i'm done with some work but if anyone knows how to fix this, i'd be glad if you could tell me.\n\ntl;dr: The game is good enough to enjoy already, but still need to be worked on. If you're unsure if you should use your money on this, i suggest adding to your wishlist and following. If you do like Zelda games in other hand, i suggest getting it now.","January 16","true","3.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

WASD to move and mouse to fight using one button for hit and one for block.\n\nThe graphics are nice anime style. There are full of colours and animations are normal for a game of these characteristics. The scenarios are quite good (the game uses source engine), water effects are good and the enviroment changes a little bit during night and day. Maybe developers must improve the models of the characters, they are a litlle bit simply, specially the enemies (there are three types: squirrels, frogs and plants). They must be better, because all of them  are low detailed and have the same look and textures.\n\nThe map is a little bit complex. I miss a little map of the area in the corner of the screen and some sort of quick travel because I spent a half of time walking around between the main sites of the map.\n\nThe game is very linear and there's no side-quests, but it's well written and its story seems long enough (I have only play the first three chapters) to give you some hours of entertainment.\n\nYou improve your skills fighting, each enemy gives you points of expirience that raise your level but I haven't been able to find new equipment (you change the sword between chapter two and three) so it neither seems there is inventory management or traits/abilities/skill point. Maybe in the next chapters this point changes,I hope so.\n\nMusic and sound are quite good, there are some qualilty tunes and sfx.\n\nThe game has no achievements neither trading cards, I encourage to developers to add them in next releases\n\nThe game needs some work but developers are working hard on it so I think it is a good choice to play, if you like Zelda style role games.\n\nPS: Thanks to Shade00","May 30","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Above is a short video of my first half hour of game play. Below are my initial thoughts on the game and purchasing recommendation.\n\nTheHiddenLevels.com was provided a preview copy from Team Monkey and for that we thank them.\n\nThis game has potential and the opportunity to be relatively good if the final product is slightly more polished. The initial mechanics are a bit rough in many areas, control, combat, and overall flow of game play. If the developers were not actively addressing these concerns openly I might be inclined not to suggest this game. The developers have been very active in updating the news for what they are improving, and most of my concerns are on their list. The one issue I did have is that between zones or chapters the loading screens seem to remove you from the experience a bit.\n\nThat being said, the game is a cute ARPG with similarities to The Legend of Zelda (Ocarina of Time or Majora's mask) in terms of it's feel. There are puzzles and combat, a seemingly large map, and multiple chapters of story which seem deep enough. Be prepared for the atypical JRPG dialogue, it makes more sense than some, but is clearly a translation that doesn't always match up. The story initially is intriguing and mysterious.\n\nThe combat is lacking, but again development is planning to improve this aspect. Currently it's sort of a repetitive experience with some variation in attacks at a higher level. The AI isn't extremely skilled and fights feel more like a task than a combat engagement. The combat controls and movement controls have some to do with this problem, and with some refinement they could be solid for the games purpose.\n\nI'll say if you are willing to watch the game develop and help attempt to shape it's future a bit then it's worth picking up. The potential to be a fun Zelda-esque game is there, but as their early access description says, this is a small passionate development team. This is one you should pick up if you want to see this type of Action RPG developed further and refined into a finished product.\n\nThanks for watching and reading.

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW\nDivinia Chronicles: Relics of Gan-Ti is a third person action adventure game made in the Source engine. As a guy who's addicted to CS:GO, TF2 and other Valve first person shooters, this game has proven me that Source isn't all about guns, headcrabs and portal guns and that a Source game can be suitable and yet understandable for children. I was amazed with cartoonish graphics, beautiful soundtrack and how they made the engine fit the game. Sadly, Source is also known for its famous invisible walls, loading screens between levels and places where you can get easily stuck which this game surely has. On the other hand, I didn't feel this kind of joy for playing a game,  long time ago and it brought back some nostalgia.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/302810/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros:Beautiful graphics\nAmazing soundtrack\nGood story\nUnique battle systemCons:Lots of loading screens\nIt has FPS drops based on where are you looking\nInvisible walls\nMinor graphical and gameplay bugs\nNo voice acting\nGame doesn't have waypoints so you might forget where you need to go═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nIf you are a Legend of Zelda fan and would like to go on another similar adventure, enjoy the beautiful scenery or the awesome soundtrack then this is a game for you!

The very end of the content you get skills/spirits.. which allow you to use 3 differnt abilities. You build mana by attacking. You start off with a heal, shield, aoe/whirlwind.\n\nAnyways, hope there is more content.. dec of next year means almost 12 months away til full release (which could change)\n\n","January 18","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is absolutely awful for these types of exploration action RPGs. It felt incredibly awkward and slow to move, especially using a controller.\n- The enemies did not feel threatening at all. I was able to just run past them most of the time, and I didn't feel much incentive to fight them.\n- Beginning story currently feels very cheesy\n\nI'll be following this game pretty closely, and hopefully it'll end up good.","April 21","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
