Defunct is a fast-paced exploration-adventure game with some racing here and there. You’re a small robot that drives around on one wheel and you’re living on some kind of cargo ship travelling across a post-human Earth. Unfortunately for you, your motor doesn’t work properly and so you can only travel at a fraction of the speed of other robots. Thankfully you’re a smart little bot and you’re equipped with a device that you can use to harness gravity and increase your speed, and that’s good because you just fell off the cargo ship. It’s been one of those days…\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the publisher.\n\nPlease note: While I don’t have a huge amount of game-time I have in fact completed the main game mode (it took me just shy of two hours) but I’ll talk more about the length of the game later on.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice when you load up Defunct is that it’s a good looking game. The graphics are by no means cutting edge and a few of the textures are a bit bland but most of the game’s levels take place in bright and colourful biomes which do indeed look great, particularly the desert biome levels. The actual models for the player’s robot and for other robots and vehicles you come across are all great. On the subject of your robot’s appearance, there are paint jobs which can be unlocked in the game though I’m not certain what the unlock requirements actually are.\n\nOnce you’ve stopped gawping at the game’s appearance it’s time to actually start playing it. You have two ways of increasing your robot’s speed. First off, you’ve got the broken motor which will get you moving, even up steep inclines, but it sure as hell is going to take its time about doing it. Your little motor is really just there in case you run out of momentum in the middle of a level or there’s a hill you want to get up. Now the other way of getting around is a lot faster and a lot more fun. It’s called the gravitation engine. The name gives an idea of what the engine actually does, it uses gravity. It’s mainly useful when you’re going down a hill of any length as a way to increase your speed. Going down the hill will give you a speed boost anyway, that’s how forces work, but when you use the gravitation engine you’re effectively ‘pulled down’ and as you can imagine that makes you pretty zippy heading down a hill.\n\nNow accelerating is all well and good but it’s pretty pointless if you can’t keep that speed. Defunct’s fast-paced sections are all about getting to a high speed and then staying there. For the most part this means you have to pick out a route through the level that’s going to keep you downhill or at least flat-ish for most of the level. You’ll also find two kinds of speed boost pick-ups, one which gives you an immediate and rather short boost of speed and one which is stored in a tank and gives you slightly more bang for your buck, especially if you get an entire tank of the stuff.\n\nI eluded to the fact in that last paragraph that Defunct isn’t the same all the way through the game. Depending on how you look at it, this is either a good thing or a bad thing. While most levels do require you to keep your speed up to some extent, possibly to reach a battery that’s high up and needs to be activated, there are some parts of the game which are quite slow, usually the up-hill sections. Personally I wasn’t too keen on the slower parts where you’re metaphorically plodding along looking for stuff but they do offer a good opportunity to take in the world around you.\n\nSpeaking of the world, now would be a good time to talk about the fact the game has eleven ‘main game’ levels and a further five levels which are made for the time trial mode only. As I said earlier the main game took me just shy of two hours to beat and since the levels are roughly the same length that works out to about ten minutes per level. The length of the game doesn’t necessarily make it a bad game and with the time trials and collectibles there are reasons to return to levels you’ve previously played but when you consider the price of admission I’m not convinced that it’s worth it.\n\nThe time trials are where the Trials mention in my title come from. Depending on the level you’ll have a certain objective to complete, such as pass through a certain number of points as fast as you can. While the time trials are pretty fun they are pretty much just bolted on to the game as the same levels with a different objective. There are medals for certain times so if you’re a completionist you may be able to squeeze a few more hours out of the game. While most of the levels are reasonably well suited to the time trial mode a couple of the longer levels felt like they didn't really fit in a should have either been shortened when playing time trial mode, i.e. remove the battery objectives, or skipped over completely.\n\nJust a few more things to mention. There are a couple more gameplay mechanics, tricks and a magnetize engine, but they don’t play a huge part in the gameplay as a whole and the game does a good job of explaining them. The game runs very well, I’m below the recommended spec for my GPU but I was still able to run it at 30FPS on max settings though, as others have mentioned, the game does suffer from occasional FPS drops. There have been a couple of complaints about controller support not working correctly but I didn’t have any trouble using my Wireless 360 Controller. Lastly, while there is a story there to give you purpose for moving through the levels, it’s pretty too basic to be at all interesting which is a shame because the robot is a pretty cool character.\n\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing on Sale.\n\nDefunct is a fun little adventure game with good graphics and gameplay but it’s let down by its length and price. If you’re a big fan of time trials or you enjoy completing games to one hundred percent you’ll probably get your money’s worth but if not then I’d recommend picking it up when it gets a sale.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","January 29","true","4.4"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","49","59","8","5"

Defunct is a game about a little broken robot who has gotten lost and is trying to get home. Despite malfunctioning a little and not reaching the same speeds as his robotic buddies, with enough momentum he can really zoom. This is a simple game, most levels are just you rolling towards the end goal while some add certain goals and puzzles. A great title for those into speed runs.\n\nThere isn’t much of a story here, your robot is lost and you need to help it get home. Because of this, you can finish the main game relatively quickly, it’s a bit too short. To make up for it, there are also time challenges and a scoreboard feature so if you want to be the best of the best that adds a bit of a replay factor. Defunct also offers trading cards and achievements to unlock that add a bit more depth and add a bit more time into the game.\n\nWhat I noticed first about the game, however, were the graphics. I wasn’t very good at this game and it’s not the kind of game I’d normally play but it looked so beautiful and smooth I wasn’t mad at it. The robot his adorable without ever speaking a word, the worlds are mellow and rendered well. It also has fun music to listen to while you get your race one as well. Aesthetically the game is a winner. Only downside is some of the terrain seems to repeat a bit since you spend most of the game on a post-human Earth.\n\nDid I mention I’m bad at this game? Because I am. Despite this, I was still able to enjoy and play the game, the controls are not complicated, the first level has a quick tutorial on how things work and after that you’re on a roll. Pun intended. You can magnetize yourself to stick to metal, allowing some upside down fun. You can use gravity itself to speed up downhill or slow down uphill. You can jump and even use your broken motor to putter along if you need help. Getting through the game requires a mix of all these things as well as performing a few tricks from time to time.\n\nIf you have a need for speed then grab this game. It’s well done, it’s fun and it’s good for speed runners. Only thing that might have made it better would be a co-op feature so you can race against other players. Also, the game is a bit on the short side so you might want to grab the title when it’s on sale. The soundtrack alone is a pleasure to listen to, so pick it up as well!\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 22","true","8.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It's a lot of fun just zooming around looking for secrets and alternate paths through the semi-open-world levels (it isn't truly open world, but you do have a lot of freedom).  The game does a good job of creating a sense of speed and rewarding skill: it has a high skill ceiling and is difficult to play well, which makes it that much more satisfying when you hit a line just right and blast through a level quickly.\n\nIt feels like there is a lot of replay value if you're an achievement chaser and you enjoy the core gameplay.  It's going to take a lot of time to find all of the secrets and unlockables, and then an even longer time to beat all the time trials.  I'd guess it's going to take me 20+ hours to 100% the game.\n\nIf you think the gameplay looks like fun, and you can see yourself playing through multiple times to finish all the achievements, unlocks and time trials, I think you won't be disappointed.  If you're the type who plays through the story mode and then uninstalls, you will find it to be too short.","January 29","true","4.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The only good thing about you is this special apparatus which can separate gravity around you. Use it downhill and you will reach extraordinary speed.\n\nDefunct is a racing / adventure game where you control a unicycle robot who was accidently flushed out from a cargo ship. Your goal is to get back to your vessel before it is too late. You will crash land onto a planet inhabited by robots; after all this game takes place post human race. In the story mode, you will move from one level to another. Pick up all the collectible items within the level (they vary from one level to another) and make sure you gather as much speed as you can. It is really all about using your gravitation engine when you are going downhill, but you will be able to use the blue roundish orbit to give you an extra boost. If you are losing momentum (especially uphill) do not worry, you still can use your broken motor to move forward! One thing I really like in the story mode is that in some levels, you will have to power up a pylon to open a door/crate to the next level.\n\nTime trial mode is very hard, to be honest, but fun! You have to reach your destination under a time limit to score a platinum medal. You will be able to freeze the clock each time you pass over the one second icon. In my case it will take some time due to the fact I have a tendency to use the gravitation engine uphill and keep missing the one-second icon. However, I do have an excuse . . .  I only have three fingers on each hand!\n\nI really enjoy the gameplay, the levels are well designed; they are fun and the game runs very well. Graphically, this game looks great. You can unlock skins for your robots, which is a nice. The controls are well balanced which makes this game really enjoyable to play.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great graphics\n-	Fun gameplay\n-	Story and time trial modes\n-	Good replay-abilities\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Some levels are too long (vast) for the time trial mode\n\nDefunct is a very good game and it deserves to be on in your game library!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Well, sort of trust it. It shows a game that's all about going fast, which is great. Sometimes that's what the game is like, but sometimes it's not.\n\nDefunct is at its best when it looks like the trailer - when you're racing over open terrain, chaining together boosts, making smart use of the whatchamadoozie to speed up down hills, figuring out ways to preserve your momentum uphill... all of that is great. What's less great is when the game decides that you need to unlock a door before you can continue. This requires you either finding keys or blowing up little red... things... to power up... some other thing... to let you move on. In these sections you're given wide open areas to play around in.\n\nHere's the thing: opening these doors? It's not hard. It's not even that time consuming. So on the whole it doesn't detract *that* much. But it's a little disheartening to be on a tear, blasting through terrain almost as fast as the game can load it, only to then be ground to a halt so you can go do some mild platforming bits. The same is true of a few other sections, where it's not a door that blocks you, but a jump that's unmakeable the first time, so you fall into a pit and go through a convoluted new path to get back to the jump from another angle. And a few little interstitial moments between chapters where you putter along with your Broken Engine, watching other lil' robots zoom ahead of you.\n\nNone of these sections are bad enough to sink the game, but they stand out for the wrong reasons. It's a little bit like the 2D Sonic the Hedgehog games. You'll get one or two stages built for "Gotta go fast!", and then you'll get that Pyramid Stage from Sonic and Knuckles, or Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2. Sure, they're fun(ish), but the game gives you mechanics centered on speed, then drops you in a level not made for speed. Defunct occasionally feels the same way. "Let's make a game all about movement, but force them to slow down every now and again." If it was intentional, I think it was a bad call.\n\nFortunately, while those spots do stick out like a sore thumb, they are relatively few. Most of the time, Defunct is all about cruising at high speeds and navigating tricky terrain, and it does both very well. If you gun it through the campaign (for lack of a better term), it should only take you 30-40 minutes, but it's the kind of thing you may want to play again, this time trying a different path, or next time trying to collect all the doodads, or even putting on some music and just enjoying the ride.\n\ntl;dr: It's short, mostly sweet, and replayable. Solid purchase.","January 30","true","5.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's an adventure, but not a point and click adventure. It's more an adventure where your protagonist are forced into an adventure. It's not a classical racer either, because you aren't racing against other people in the story mode. There are however challenges that you can unlock. You can also "race" against other players online. So you have a time to beat, time challenges. The best way to describe the game would probably be adventure-exploration racer.\n\nThe storymode is fairly short, I believe it took me around 2 hours to complete. Which is a bit short. I did however know where to go, because I have played an even earlier version of the game. As explained earlier though, there are unlockables and a time challenge in the game, so it has a replayability value.\n\nI wager to say that the feel of the game is fairly unique. The developers did a good job with the gameplay and the graphics. Levels are well thought out. I'd say buy it for a unique, cozy and an awesome experience.

But because accidentally gravitizing when going uphill can be detrimental to your speed, it becomes very rewarding with increased proficiency of the controls. It's when you're whooshing effortlessly across big, open landscapes that this game really shines. On the other hand, hitting trees or debris (which you'll inevitably do occasionally) isn't being penalized to the same extent, which is nice.\n\nThe levels are varied and mostly non-linear in nature. You often have many different paths to take or orders in which to take on challenges.\n\nMy only gripe with it is that it's somewhat short.

It’s a 3D platformer all about speed, and using momentum to quickly traverse the levels. It’s got a Wall-E quality to it in terms of the theme, with what looks like an abandoned human planet now occupied by little quick robots.\n\nPresentationThe developer clearly understands style and colour. There are a lot of sections of the game, most notably sections like Oasis, which really pop out of the screen. The environments were really varied, with desert highways and meadow-like hills neighbouring unrealistically, but welcomely, near each other. It’s a shame that, I feel like, there was some pretty gross framerate drops and it always seemed to happen in the pretty areas. The thing is, Defunct looks good from afar, but bad up close. The textures are really low res, even with the setting at very high, which makes the cutscenes look pretty damn ugly. Luckily for the majority of the game you won’t be looking at the textures too up close, and you’re supposed to be going fast, so it should be that the environments are a hypnotising blur of colour as you traverse the landscape.\n\nMechanicsUnfortunately though, that was the real issue with the game. The game is definitely at it’s best when you are travelling at high speed, jumping from platform to platform smoothly. The issue is that it’s too difficult to keep up momentum most of the time. 90% of the time I was able to identify the path I needed to take in order to do awesome jumps and travel quickly, but the handling of the character is so finicky and slow I could almost never do what I MEANT to do. I do think there should be challenge in games like this, but it should be based on your reaction times and making snap decisions to travel in certain directions, not based on whether or not the volatile physics of the engine want to agree with you. Far too many times I’d be travelling at high speed, feeling great, and then smack into a wall because I was travelling TOO FAST and missed the platform I was supposed to land on. And if the pacing of the game wasn’t being undermined enough, there are these weird puzzle-like sections where you slow down and collect batteries to power up the door that lets you progress. The gameplay is fun when it works the way I want it to, the issue is, it almost never works the way I want it to, and it becomes frustrating. Maybe the game would be more fun for someone who spends a lot of time with it and gets familiar with the controls, but my bet is that is not going to be the majority of people.\n\nStoryThe story isn’t anything crazy. You’re a little robot who fell off his ship, and now you have to return to it. Even so, there was some surprisingly satisfying story beats, and that’s backed up by an interesting world that tells you a bit about itself just from looking around the environment. For example you see old rusted cars and highways around the place, so you can gather that humans used to live here, and the music is often your que that the story is progressing. It’s little details like that that make this world one that you want to be in. There’s also some really interesting sections of the game where your character is supposed to be feeling a certain way, and it’s reflected really well by the mechanics. For example, during a moment where there seems to be little or no hope, you’ll find yourself having to push yourself up hills, and failing jumps that you could easily have made with a bit more speed. The mechanics of the game allowed some of the story to be told, which I think is really cool.\n\nVerdictIn the end, I finished this game in 90 minutes. That’s short, but for the right price that can be reasonable. The price the developers gave me was 11 euros (I am writing this review pre-release). Converting that, is 12 dollars, so the final price of the game could be anywhere between 10 and 15 dollars in the US, probably 12 or 13 dollars. 13 dollars is way too much. 10 is better, but still not really a good price. This should be a $5-7 game in reality. So the price isn’t great, maybe pick the game up on sale for around the price i recommended, but even then it’s gonna depend. If you appreciate an interesting and sometimes quite pretty world and a fairly satisfying story; oh and also can look past frustrating mechanics? Sure. Buy it on sale. Otherwise, I’m going to have to say avoid.\n\nScore\nPresentation: 6\nMechanics: 4\nStory: 8\nPrice to Quality Ratio: 4\nPersonal Enjoyment: 4\n\nFinal:  5.2/10\n\n(the final score is calculated from the average of the sub-scores)\n\nDefunct is getting a score of 5.2 out of 10. So, you know, maybe a tiny bit better than meh? The story was the driving force of what got me through the game, and the presentation was pretty good all around leaving aside the textures; that said, the mechanics were flawed; 12 dollars is far too expensive for this, kind of, meh experience, and I just found myself frustrated most of the time.","January 29","false","1.4"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","11","31","0","0"

The core mechanics of this game is something I've never seen before. It's simple, new, engaging, and satisfying. It feels great to chain together good downhill runs to get up to an insane speed. It's creative. It has a nice looking asthetic that is also not very taxing  to a lower end machine.\n\nBut the game is short. Really short. I got to the end in about 45 minutes without going out of my way for collectibles. I'm telling you guys now, so you all are  not allowed to whine when you buy the game and are finished within the hour. This is the biggest issue with the game, and the one thing that had me questioning whether it was worth the 15 bucks. At the end of the day, I do think it is worth it. It is a fun game.\n\nUltimately, what Defunct did for me was get me excited about a potential Defunct 2, and it made me want to pay attention to the developers of this game to see what they do next. It is short, but there is a lot of great stuff in here. I am excited to see what these guys do with an abudance of rescources and time.","February 28","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxyBoxes/recommended/359350/","FoxyBoxes","2401 Penitent Tangent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxyBoxes/","217 products in account","Defunct is a game that, at first, seems to be about speed. It looks pretty good, it plays pretty well, and then it ruins it all by trying to be a platformer. It looks fantastic in the trailer, and I was in love the first time I saw it. Sadly, it failed spectacularly to meet my expectations. Unless you really like arbitrary collectibles and time trials, I'd wait to buy it at a heavily reduced price during a sale. The game isn't bad (it's actually decent), but it's padded out far, far too much with silly optional "content" to make it even close to worth the price tag of £10.99.\nPros:\n- Building and keeping speed is challenging and fun\n\n- Environments look fantastic and have a great feel to them, for an indie game the graphics are good\n\n- Has nice, simple mechanics that work well together (when the game decides you get to go fast)\n\n- You can get through the main bulk of the content in a couple of hours\n\nCons:\n- About 50% of the game isn't much like the trailer, because...\n\n- ...you're forced to stop and open gates which destroyed all flow and most of the enjoyment I got out of the game\n\n- Not that well optimised. My PC is more than powerful enough to run this on upwards of 90 fps no problem, but I kept getting minor stutters and hiccups in fps. It sounds minor, but in a game that emphasis speed and smooth movement between jumps, hills, and turns, it was intensely frustrating.\n\n- And the biggest failing: All the "replayability" is in time trials and achievements. This part is what made me feel cheated. Sorry, but that isn't replayability.\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend this game unless you're just going to refund it after finishing it if only because it's simply too short. There just isn't enough actual content (unless you're a completionist and like going after achievements, the top spot on time trials, and arbitrary collectibles).","January 31","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
