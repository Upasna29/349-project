"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/recommended/25890/","thordred","Thordred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/","2085 products in account","In the world of gaming, where modern games tend to become ever more colourful, faster and action-packed, and even complex strategy titles like the Total War or Civilization series offer more and more eye candy, this grand strategy game is the ugly duckling. It's not one of the cheerleaders but the geek you choose to learn math with. It's like an encyclopedia among hollywood movies. Instead of stunning effects and pretty graphics it has statistics and maps.\n\nIt presents itself with minimalistic visuals and sounds. But this is not what this game is about so I leave it at that.\n\nHoI3 lets you take control over almost any nation that existed from 1936 to 1948 and lays its destiny during this difficult time in history in your hands. This is your chance to rewrite history, depending on your actions historical events like Japans attack on Pearl Harbor can occur earlier or later (or never) than they did in reality. Let's say you start a game in '36 with the U.S. You will have some time before Japan decides to attack. Will you prepare for war in the Pacific or build strong trade relations with Japan to make a war with you undesirable? And when all hell breaks loose in Europe, will you join the allies against the German Reich or do you have other goals? Or maybe you long for a real challenge, want to stay away from the major powers and try your luck with one of the smaller nations? How about playing as Brazil, joining the axis, trying to conquer South America and hold your ground against the U.S.A. The possibilities are unlimited.\n\nYou are given an enourmous amount of freedom when organizing your military. You can even put together your own divisions with three to five brigades to combine different types of units to tailor them to your particular needs. Set up chains of commands to influence supply lines and and combat strength or let the A.I. play individual commanders (and with them all units under their command) for you.\n\nNot only do you command your troops but you are also responsible for reconnaissance, diplomacy, espionage, domestic politics, technological research, industrial production and infrastructure. All these elements are important and influence each other. For example: If you use your entire industrial capacity to produce troops you will not be able to produce enough consumer goods to maintain the approval among your civilian population and you will have to deal with uprisings (in totalitarian nations) or a power shift towards opposition parties (in democratic nations). The same goes for your A.I. controlled opponents: Use spies to influence their domestic political climate to your advantage and weaken their war efforts. Every one of these tasks can be delegated to the A.I. but its highly recommended to do at least the most important jobs yourself. The A.I. is not totally incompetent, in fact it does a pretty decent job, but a reasonably experienced player will still make the better decisions. And besides, why would you want to spend your time watching a game play itself?\nOnly new players might want to concentrate on one gameplay element at a time to get used to it before taking over complete control.\n\nThe size of the world map is immense, it is divided into 15000 (!) areas and maintaining the overview can become a difficult task, especially when you're playing as one of the big nations, with a huge army, war on several fronts and try to handle as much as possible without the help of the A.I.\n\nHoI3 is played in real-time but lets you adjust the speed to your liking or pause any time during the game.\n\nIf you like a game to take you by the hand and tell you what to do, Hearts of Iron is not for you. It is difficult to learn and difficult to master, the six short tutorials are not overly helpful. It doesn't even lay down objectives for you. You won't miss them because there's always a lot to do and take care of. But if a strategy game with an impressive depth that puts all other representatives of the genre to shame in terms of complexity is what you want and if you have the patience and time to get over the initial steep learning curve, you can have fun for years to come with this title.\n\nA few words about the DLCs (HoI3 has a lot of them): Semper Fi, For The Motherland and Their Finest Hour are the must get expansions, all the sprite packs... not so much. You will most likely not want to use the option to replace the nato symbols with new fancy sprites, as they provide more information about the units at a quick glance. The three aforementioned larger expansions on the other hand come with a great many features that really enhace the gameplay a lot. These include but are not limited to: New types of units for many nations, A.I. improvements, an extended espionage system, enhanced economic diplomacy, a strategic warfare screen that visually displays important combat information, improved, more in-depth naval warfare and more realistic amphibious assaults, enhanced character development of your commanders, additional combat tactics, balancing adjustments of unit attributes and many more.","December 8, 2013","true","105.6"," 317 of 330 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","317","330","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprilly/recommended/25890/","sprilly","Sprilly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprilly/","281 products in account","Hearts of Iron III is an excellent game. It allows the player to control any nation in the lead-up to WW2, or during it if you prefer. These range from Nazi Germany, of course, to the Dominican Republic, which gives you an idea of the level of choice on offer. The game essentially drops you into the world as head-of-state of one of these many nations, and it's entirely up to you what to do from there: will you align with the Axis in Europe to gain your share of the economic gains in the upcoming war? Or will you side with Stalin's Russia and work to undermine Fascism and the Allies, in an attempt to dominate the world with Communism?\n\nHowever, the level of historical accuracy in HOI3 is astounding, despite the player's ability to make independent and alternate choices. For example, there is a system of "decisions" in the game which often provide some sort of benefit, one of which is the historical Anschluss of Austria for Germany. As well as this, there are literally thousands of officers, with their own traits and skill levels (which can be improved with combat), to assign to command your divisions or brigades. These are just two examples in an intricate web of historical detail. WW2 history buffs like myself will be elated at the opportunity to not only, for example, command Rommel's Afrika Korps, but lead it to complete victory in the Middle East! Again, this is just an example that popped into my head, the level of possibility is insane.\n\nAside from the military aspect of the game, which is the focus, there are various other sectors of your nation that you can alter control. There is the politics tab, where you select your ministers and make policies, as well as administer the areas that have come under your occupation through war. There is the diplomacy tab, where, if you are a leader of a faction, such as the Axis, you can influence nations to join you in alliance, and make trade deals, sell equipment, declare war, ETC. Other tabs include research, production, intelligence. I won't go into detail on these, but all are as important as each other.\n\nPROS\n+ Insanely high level of historical detail (accurate divisional names, commanders, ministers in governments, literally tens      of thousands of provinces)\n+ Ability to relive or rewrite history, in your own unique way.\n+ Greatly immersive, you get to the point where hours just slip away in what feels like minutes!\n+ Huge scale wars, on land sea, and air, where you are the commander in chief.\n\nCONS\n- Not recommended if the player is looking for amazing graphics- the gameplay is what sells HOI3, not the visuals.\n- A tad buggy. The game crashes relatively frequently, especially if tinkering around in console commands.\n- Steep learning curve, but once you get the full hang of it, you'll realise it was well worth the time put into it.\n\nOverall rating: 12/15 (Great!)","April 30, 2015","true","183.5"," 169 of 172 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","169","172","4","2"

RAF Hurricanes tried to respond but were met by the escorting Bf-109s. The bombers pounded the remnants of the British army dug in around London and throughout Kent, the motley handful of survivors from a disastrous attempt to turn around the war through a raid on Germany itself via Kiel. Few survived that as the British army was quickly cut off, surrounded and annihilated.\n\nHowever tonight the bombs weren't the only thing falling from the sky.  Other shapes came down, softly, dangling beneath canopies. Paratroopers of the XXIV Fallschirmj√§ger Korps commanded by Generalleutnant Student dropped throughout Dover, immediately assaulting the harbour and RAF Hawkinge. Less than half an hour later, with the battle for these key locations ongoing, explosions rocked the coastal defences as three Admiral Hipper class Heavy Cruisers opened fire whilst landing craft flooded into Dover, disgorging thousands of marines in support of the paratrooper drop. The Home Fleet could do nothing to disrupt the landings, with the Channel being completely dominated by the German main fleet consisting of the battleships Bismarck, Tirpitz, Schlesien and Scharnhorst  in support of the gargantuan super-battleship G√∂tz von Berlichingen with an escorting screen of destroyers.\n\nBut all of this was a distraction from the real attack. A couple of hours after the initial assault, with all of the British attention on Dover, almost a hundred and fifty miles further west a second wave of paratroopers dropped onto Bournemouth. The British Army had nothing in the area to respond with other than handfuls of local garrison troops and Home Guard units which were quickly overwhelmed by the elite German troops and the harbour taken. With the door now kicked in transport ships steamed into the harbour, disembarking the XVII and XXII Panzerkorps which quickly spread in all directions. The biggest push being, of course, for London and from there to Dover.\n\nOn the outskirts of London a brief armour battle broke out with the remanants of the once-proud British armoured divisions fighting tenaciously but hopelessly to prevent the assault from breaking through into the capital itself. Eventually, however, the inevitable happened and as paratroopers stormed the gates of Buckingham Palace the British Army retreated from London. The forces fighting in Dover, now cut off entirely and surrounded, fought ferociously to break through with some limited successes. But for many, completely out of fuel and ammunition, all they could do was surrender. Britain was not yet conquered, but with two supply routes from France forced open and more German divisions arriving every hour the end result was no longer in question, it was just a matter of time.\n\n\nJanuary 1942\n\nI sip my coffee in a Parisian cafe as I study the reports from across the Channel. Five long months since the first attack but now the British Isles are almost completely pacified. I sign off on the orders to begin transferring the Panzerarmees under my command back to France and from there to the eastern front, as well as to Student's recommendation to let his two Fallschirmj√§ger Korps cross the border into Ireland to finish off the last potential threat in the theatre. I lean back in my chair and sigh with fatigue, staring at nothing.\n\nA cough brings me back to my senses. An aide holds out a piece of paper, snapping a salute, a staff car idling behind him. Raising a brow I take the paper and read it. Stalin has finally made his move with an attack near K√∂nigsberg. Worse, a large force of the Red Army has also assaulted Finland and the Finns are close to breaking point. My attention is needed in the east, personally.\n\nI stand, carefully settle my cap into place and drop some money on the table and make for the staff car whilst asking the aide to find out the progress on the Panzer VIII Maus super heavy tank project I ordered for development. I think I'm going to need some very big guns for this one...","July 5, 2015","true","128.1"," 179 of 192 people (93%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","93","179","192","55","8"

But if you play as a small country, its hard to get a lot of people in the military, and you usually have to watch what techs you research, and be sure to at least research agriculture, and change some policies to get manpower.\nGraphics6/10 Unit graphics are good, counters are easy to read, most map modes are good, but the terrain one is bad.... its a grand strategy, it doesn't matter anyways.\nAI7/10 Somewhat good, it at times can make very bad decisions and do things poorly, other times, it can stomp things, and maintain whatever well. Some times its hard to beat, and a lot of the time, if you don't plan well, it can STOMP you.Freedom6/10 Compared to other Grand Strategies, there isn't much freedom. The time span is only a few years leaving little to happen (but the days are extended with long hours) The game is pretty much set. Its very difficult to do extreme things like changing history in a bizzare way, though it is possible. But all of those things aside, its still fun. BTW, I created a Soviet Poland and avoided getting stomped by Germany by luck.Bugs, crashes and problems4/10 Warning, there is huge problems here. The game is somewhat unstable, it will usually crash after some hours. It may not even start. For a lot of people lucky or not, it will crash, it will not start. There are ways around this, deleting files, downloading other things and such, but its troublesome.Compared to other Grand Strategies9/10 Hoi 3 is a great game overall. Its a gem, if it works. It is better than most Grand Strategies, aside from game breaking things. It will amaze you, but it is somewhat harder.Overall8/10 The game is great, recommend picking it up, but it actually is barren sadly, you have to get Semper Fi, For the Motherland, Their Finest Hour, in that order for it to actually be worth while.","October 29, 2014","true","52.2"," 153 of 161 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","153","161","4","7"

There is tonnes to research and different nations have different units and weapons to research but in the end its all just numbers and stats, all the nations are essentially the same.\n-Can be bug riddled depending on if you buy DLC or not, Patches are contained within the DLC so if you want to get a better, more stable game you need to buy DLC.\n\nThis game does require a lot of time to learn all the mechanics and systems but (personally) is highly rewarding once you do so. If you can't be bothered to do that, there are plenty of cheats in the game to enable you to do some completely insane stuff (I personally took over the world as New Zealand) All in all, its a great game, not much else like it on the market other than other Paradox games, which I would highly recommend as well.","May 16, 2015","true","178.8"," 150 of 167 people (90%) found this review helpful 124 people found this review funny","90","150","167","124","3"

It had a good balance of playability and realism and there were some issues which needed fixing, such as convoys and the occasionally flaky AI but it was a good game.\n\nHOI3, sadly, is not.  It has taken me a while to work out why, but I think it's because, in trying to make it a complete war simulation, the developers have failed to either make it accurate or make it fun.  The accuracy claim sounds harsh, so let me explain.\n\n1 - Research.  There's no logic to it.  One has to seperately research the gun carriages and weapons for anti-tank guns, for anti-aircraft guns, and artillery.  That's six separate thingies to research.  Then there's a seventh bit for heavy AA for your provinces.\nNow in reality, what happened was that the best anti-tank weapons (British 17pdr, German 88, American 3") all started life as AA guns.  It would make far more sense to have a 'foundry' option where guns could be researched and then applied to different areas.\nWhy even force people to research three lots of gun carriages?  It makes absolutely no sense.\n\nThe same applies to separate research for cavalry weapons, militia weapons, and infantry weapons.  What, we're all using different rifles now?\n\nAs a minor aside let me come on to the logic behind the naming of each progressive unit.  For example, the British medium tank starts as the A9 cruiser, then when you research 1940 tanks it becomes the A15 Crusader (skipping the A13), then for 1942 tanks it becomes the Sherman Firefly.  What?  No Cromwell?  Why the Firefly?  This isn't the only case of a total lack of logic in the choice of naming. The naming doesn't affect the game but for a game which boasts of its realistic nature it is totally out of place.\n\nIMO the complexity of the research tree does NOT add anything to the game.  I think it could have been halved in size and been far more enjoyable to use without losing any gameplay.\n\n\n2 - Convoys.  The problem with convoys is that there is no mechanism to manage their routes.  This was a problem in HOI2 where the German AI could sink the entire British convoy fleet by hanging around in a few areas of the North Sea and continually sinking ships.  The very least HOI3 should have had is a convoy management system.  The player should be able to tell the convoy routing system NOT TO SAIL through certain areas.  Instead I have to watch convoys being sunk in the middle of the North Sea and around the English Channel, instead of rerouting all my convoys to the NW coast of Scotland or Liverpool and Belfast (as was done historically).  It's a huge oversight and it is one of the primary problems with playing as the British.  One of the other problems is that the cost of both convoys and escorts is fixed and does not fall over time (as it did historically with Liberty Ships and corvettes).  It's almost as though the game is written solely with land combat in mind and about 3/4 of the way through someone said "Hey, wasn't there someone else in WW2 beside Germany and Russia?"\n\nIt's a real problem and affects playability and the prospect of a historical outcome to WW2.\n\n3.  Naval AI.  While I'm on the subject, the AI doesn't seem to know what to do with its ships.  The Germans send their battleships out unescorted to hang around the west coast of England and get sunk.  Which they do.  A lot.  It makes me suspect that the major emphasis for the game was on land combat and naval was not addressed properly.\n\n4.  Allies.  In HOI2 getting allies to fight for or with you was easy.  They often sent you units, and there was an option for you to take over their entire armed forces.  In HOI3 that option doesn't exist.  And they don't send you units.   You have to 'set objectives' to get the allies to work with you.  These objectives don't really work.  So, when playing as Britain, Canada keeps its air force and navy and army in Canada.  When you urgently need Canadian fighters to defend your airspace and Canadian destroyers to patrol the Atlantic, they won't budge.  There is no way to unify command, so you don't fight as allies but merely as participants in a global war where you aren't fighting each other.  It's poor.\n\n\n5.  Crashes.  Oh my goodness, the game's unreliability is terrible.  It crashes to desktop the whole time.   To minimise the inconvenience of losing my game progress I set it to autosave every game week, which is the most frequent autosave setting.  However, if you are in the middle of a huge amount of preparation for your forces (reorganising your divisions for example) the game might crash.  This has happened a couple of times to me, where I've been playing as Soviets and have been engaged in a major reorganisation of my 300+ divisions, and the game has just crashed to the desktop, and of course the autosave hasn't kicked in because I'm not progressing time through the game.  HOI2 never did this, and it's by far the most infuriating feature of the game.\n\n6.  Graphics and Interface.  It's cluttered and it's illogical and it's poorly laid out and it's not designed to work on higher resolution settings.  It's a bloody mess.  And let's talk about the little pictures for each unit that appears in the research window and the production window.  Apparently it was too much effort for the devs to dig out the pictures of the units that they used in HOI2.  As a result far too many units, which had the correct photo in the previous game, have a 'stock' photo in this game.\n\n\nThere are historical oddities, too, ones which ought to have stood out like a sore thumb.  It is now possible to build (assuming you have the IC) lots of provincial AA without expending any manpower.  Who's manning all those guns?  Historically Nazi Germany had to commit a million men to defending their homeland from bombers, and that was a drain on manpower.  In HOI3, they don't have to.  They had to in HOI2.\n\nI could live with the game if it was new.  If it had been out for a couple of months I'd say "Well, every game ships with bugs so I can live with it for now."  But this isn't a new game, it's been out for years, and instead of fixing the very serious reliability bugs, and instead of sticking in a few dozen stock photos, Paradox decided that an urgent priority was some 3D counters which they could charge extra money for.  It's not good enough.\n\nI can't recommend this game.  If it was claiming to be a beer-and-crisps wargame I could overlook its historical inaccuracy.  It's claiming to be a very accurate game, and it isn't.  It's not accurate enough for a historical wargame, it's not fun enough for a 'quick dip in and have some fun' wargame.  It's too unreliable to be any kind of game at all.\n\n\n","December 7, 2014","false","277.5"," 308 of 380 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","308","380","7","15"

It's definitely the type of game you need to invest time into learning. There is a deep learning curve but once you get a feel for the game, it makes sense why its so difficult to learn, because it basically lets you control almost anything. The game dynamics are amazing and very complicated but then again, so is global warfare. There is a great community of devoted HOI3 players who have answered literally every question related to this game so if you get it and find yourself not understanding the game dynamics, such as the supply situation, you can easily go online and read up on it. The supply dynamics, while sometimes buggy, is one of my favorite aspects of the game. If you're invading Western france, make sure to get large ports and not to outpace your supplies, less you fall victim to an axis counter attack that finds your front undersupplied and pushes them back in chaos. I like how the game manages the organization of the troops, both in terms of command structure and in terms of the org of the specifc unit. If they're under supplied or disorganized, they'll fail in an attack and soon you'll find the enemy routing you across the continent. It really takes a great deal of practice and patience to mount the correct offensive. You get a sense for how underprepared offensives can go awry in a second, especially when playing as Germany and trying to raise through the Soviet Union. You might get within 2 provinces of Moscow before you realize that you're supply lines havent caught up (because you didnt research the techs you needed) and then the Soviets counter attack with inferior forces and you have to scramble to recover. Thats the fun of the game though. You can prepare all you want but if things dont work out the way you planned, you often have to plan on the fly.\n\nI played as the Soviet Union and thought I was perfectly set up to protect the mother land against the germans but got my but handed to me three ways to leningrad. It was the game of my life, reorganizing and launching desperate and doomed counter attacks to slow down the germans while I get more troops ready. It's very interesting because when you play as the Soviets you get the impression that the germans better conquer you within a year, because if they dont, you can create about 10 infantry divisions a month and thats a pace the Germans can't ever sustain.\n\nAnyways, this game is amazing. You can play as anyone, Brazil for example, and work just to contribute a tiny amount to the war effort. Or you can play as the US and let Europe be while you focus on hunting and eliminating Japanese carrier groups that you know they can't replace the way the US can. Nimitz, Halsey and Spruance to the rescue!\n\nIf you like strategy and grand warfare, give this game a try, If you take the time to learn it and you understand what kind of game you are buying, you will not be disappointed!","August 1, 2014","true","474.2"," 102 of 111 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","102","111","0","0"

It's a hardcore (as hardcore as it can get, actually!) Grand Strategy Game by Paradox Interactive. That one sentence really says it all.\nThis review is intended for those who don't yet know what Grand Strategy (the capitals are there with a purpose!) is all about. Simply put: Grand Strategy games are the best, but also the most complex,  pc gaming has to offer. They are immersive, complex, and very addictive. They are not for everyone, that's for sure. You don't play them for the graphics, nor for the sounds or some great level-design, but only for the gameplay, which can also be very, very difficult to master. There are tons of stats, of units and/or provinces to be controlled and only one person who has the power to control them: you.\n\nLet's take Hearts of Iron III as an example. Untill less than a year ago, I was convinced that this kind of games was nothing for me. Too difficult, too one-sided, yoo much of an effort to learn playing it; I had lots of reasons not to delve into them. That's untill my son convinved me to at least have shot at this one. I gave it a try, but stopped playing after an hour of so. I couldn't make anything out of all the numbers and stats on the screen, and the static map where nothing seemed to happen except for the slow advancing of the time. Then I read a superb guide made by the famous HOI3-community. It took me over a month to study guide and game (and it was really studying, not even really playing), but then I was hooked. You see: it literally takes effort and even study to get into this game, but once you've done that, the effort more than pays off, and you can start guiding your nation to victory, survival or downright defeat during the crucial period 1936-1948.\n\nHOI3 lets you play ANY of the nations in the world, starting on 1/1/1936 and going into World War II (or avoiding it by following a more peaceful path). It's a tough challenge because you have to manage all aspects of government, economics, technological research and military, but once you see your nation flourishing, the reward is enthralling. The amount of management needed to succeed is staggering: you'll spend most of your time playing HOI3 by looking at screens full of statistics, numbers and tech trees, but once you realize that you can really have an influence on how all of these evolve by making the right decisions, it feels like being in command of something very complex.\n\nJust give it a try if you feel it's ok to have to study a game in order to be able to enjoy it; the rewards will be there for sure. Very important: do get the expansion packs Semper Fi, For the Motherland and Their Finest Hour as well (all three needed). They really improve upon game mechanics and are needed if you decide to give one of the many, many available mods a try.\n\nGameplay: 28/30\nGraphics: 14/20 (they do the job more than decently, but could have been a bit more engrossing)\nSound: 7/10 (playlist is great!)\nGameplay for your money: 18/20 (multiplayer is a technical disaster, but SP can keep you going for years)\nTechnical/stability: 8/10 (after lots of bug-problems, it's now fairly stable, but MP is really difficult to set up)\nPersonal feel: 10/10 (just love this one)\n\nOverall: 85/100","July 17, 2014","true","253.4"," 92 of 103 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","92","103","0","0"

I played the base game plus all expansions (SF, FtM, TFH).\n\nYou can manage every aspect of the war, from diplomacy to espionage to research to actual combat. You can even try to stay neutral and sit out the fighting if you want, but what fun would that be?\n\nThere is an enormous amount of complexity - casual gamers beware! If one part of the war is too tedious for you, it can be set to be automated. For example, rather than personally overseeing every trade deal you can check a box and let the computer handle all of your trades. The computer is not as smart as a person and it can't metagame but in most tasks it does an adequate job.\n\nPersonally, I'm a WW2 history buff and I love to wrap my head around complex rule systems, so this was right up my alley. This is one of the few games I've played where I wrote out multiple pages of notes to plan my strategy.\n\nFor my first game I decided to play as Canada, which is a good beginner choice because you're safe from imminent invasion and have a decent (not overwhelming) amount of resources to play with. Just like history I joined the Allies. I sent troops to help France, getting my first taste of combat. I lost of course, but learned a lot and even got to stage my own hectic Dunkirk evacuation to get my battered troops out of harm's way. Later my rebuilt forces kicked the Italians out of Africa and captured Sicily. An amphibious invasion of mainland Italy failed, but when my British allies successfully invaded Nazi-occupied Greece I joined them and had great fun. By 1944 the Soviets had overrun most of northern Europe, with the western allies in control of the Balkans and Africa. I quit at that point, since finishing the war against Japan was a naval battle and most of my fleet had been sunk.\n\nNext I decided to play a totally ahistorical game. I chose Brazil and decided to ignore WW2 and try to conquer South America. I built a huge army of militia and other low-quality bullet fodder, successfully overwhelming my neighbors through sheer numbers. Alas, my flagrant violations of the Monroe Doctrine had attracted the wrath of the powerful USA. Shortly after I captured the Panama canal the Americans arrived in force and their tanks proceeded to pulverize my hapless militia. Still, it was fun, and I learned about the importance of anti-tank weapons and combined arms.\n\nMy next game came about while fooling around with the espionage tools. As Germany I helped the national socialists win the 1937 election in the Netherlands. It was a huge electoral upset, sweeping away the liberal democracy and replacing it with a totalitarian state. Accusations of fraud and vote rigging were completely unfounded (tee-hee!). I thought, wow, this is so cool, I just changed a government! But the only thing cooler would be to actually play as this new government. So I saved the game and rejoined it as the new extremist Netherlands. I joined the Axis, but refused to join Germany in declaring war on the UK or Soviet Union. Instead I conquered a bunch of neutral nations, and acted essentially as a resource "banker" for the Axis faction, as the Axis powers are resource-starved in the mid to late game. What fun!\n\nI've played many other games but the stories are too numerous to repeat. I'll just say if you like military strategy you're in for a treat!\n\nI have a few criticisms. Despite the manual being 80 pages long, it wasn't enough. There are many things in the game which aren't well documented. HOI3 is even more complex than Civilization V, but it lacks the helpful "Civopedia" feature that game had to quickly look up how something works.\n\nFor example, in one game I was playing as Finland and planned several years in advance to declare war on Germany and then launch an amphibious invasion of Norway. I spent considerable time (years in-game, hours in real life) building up my fleet, but when it came time to attack I found I couldn't move my ships to Norway. After much puzzling I discovered that since the Germans owned a specific province that the Danish straights were blocked to me. There was nothing in the manual about straights being blocked, and nothing on the map to illustrate that they were. So all my preparations were for naught. Lesson learned: Save often! Or better yet, set the autosave for every 6 months so if any similar nasty surprises happen you'll be prepared and maybe able to recover.\n\nMy other criticism is that the supply system is dumb. For some reason ports and airfields don't stockpile supplies. So if you re-base your planes or ships to a new base you immediately run out of fuel. Even worse, all supplies are distributed from your capitol. So if you're playing as the USA don't be surprised when your troops in California start starving to death because their supplies are inexplicably drawn all the way from Washington DC (and each province the supplies go through results in a supply tax).\n\nI would think the solution to this problem would be to create supply dumps at appropriate locations. Unfortunately Paradox's solution to the problem was to create an "Arcade mode," an optional mode in which all supplies magically appear wherever they need to be all the time. But this just creates new problems because a big part of the military strategy is about cutting off enemy forces from their supplies, using bombers to shred their logistics, ect. With arcade mode you lose all of that, so I ended up sticking with the default supply system despite its flaws.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to WW2 history buffs and military strategists. Casual gamers should stay away though.","November 22, 2014","true","755.9"," 71 of 77 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","71","77","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/recommended/25890/","seriouscatnz","SeriousCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/","365 products in account","Rating: 9/10\n\nHearts of Iron III is a real-time grand strategy and operational tactics game set during the Second World War. All aspects of warfare at the divisional scale upwards are represented, including military command structures, military appointments, economics, production, international trade, logistics, espionage, military research, legal polices, and political appointments. Players can (and should) automate as much of the game as they wish, and the friendly AI is very good at handling routine tasks and reducing micromanagement.\n\nThe sheer scale of this game can be overwhelming at first. You can play as any nation and even avoid participating in world wars altogether. You can start a small scale regional war to advance your nation's expansionist interests whilst the rest of the world is distracted by the threat of even greater wars, such as the first half of the Second Sino-Japanese War before the bombing of Pearl Harbour. This period in history centres around total war, or the use of all the state's resources towards warfare and some countries will find it incredibly difficult to avoid being engulfed in the Second World War.\n\nAdmittedly, it's a hard game to love at first. The music score is mediocre, and the UI offers so much information players won't know on what to focus. To make matters worse, both the tutorial and manual are useless. Luckily, there's an excellent video series by Michael Broschek covering everything you need (YouTube). I strongly recommend you watch this tutorial series. Afterwards, the UI becomes very easy to navigate and you'll know what and how to automate using the AI, making gameplay a breeze without losing control.\n\nThe command structure for land units is a unique feature of this game and I haven't found anything else like it. Once you've mastered them they become incredibly powerful tools for automation. Largely static lines of defence and slowly advancing attack can be reliably handled by the AI, whilst you can focus your attention on the main thrust. Military units at the lowest level are brigades organised into divisions. Divisions can then be attached to corps, corps to army, and armies to army groups. Having different levels of command grant powerful bonuses. Depending on which general you assign to a division, there are additional bonuses or downsides. However, you must remain within the command range of each respective command level in order to gain those bonuses or units will lose cohesion. Navies and air forces are much easier to handle, due to how their command structures operate differently.\n\nThere's endless replayability within the standard game, but for those wanting more it's essential that you shop around for some of the user made modifications. There are literally dozens of top quality mods on the developer forums (Paradox Plaza[forum.paradoxplaza.com]), though you'll need to create a free account in order to access it. The standard game provides a good challenge at the hardest difficulty level, but allows for unrealistically easy and effective Blitzkrieg-style tactics. In my opinion, the best realism mod right now is the Iron Cross Edition, or BlackICE (Paradox Plaza Thread[forum.paradoxplaza.com]). It's intended for those looking for a realistic and incredibly difficult challenge, and is meant to be played at the hardest difficulty setting.","December 4, 2013","true","107.7"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","42","46","0","3"

The complexity of the productive, technological and combat system is very high. The logistic system, especially,is more important and more detailed than in many other games. These all work to the game's advantage, since they make for a very good experience for players that want to deal with things complex and not just "produce units and rush". Terrain, weather, organization,morale, how many officers you have, who's in charge of what division/corps etc, means a lot in this game, and this will probably please more experience players looking for a challenge.\n\nAnd of course like other Paradox games, it has a a bit long learning curve.","February 24, 2014","true","24.6"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","43","51","0","2"

I have played over 1500 hours (other account) and can say that this is my favourite game on steam.\nBasically, you choose a nation in the world and begin in 1936, preparing for the World War. Wisely choose the units you produce and deploy in order to achieve your victory. Beware of manpower as it can be your best friend, or your worst enemy. Use Technology to research up-to-date technologies to improve your industries, army, navy and air force. Politics will enable you to enact new laws and replace ministers in order to create your desired backbench. Intelligence will allow you to gain an advantage over your opponents. But beware, as spies are always watching. The AI in the game is probably the only thing I would criticize, but then again why wouldn't you want to control an entire nation by hand? Performing encirclements is probably the most satisfying thing about the game. Barbarossa is always intriguing and exciting. Many would simply play as a major nation, but don't forget the minors who play a large factor in the war. Hold the Southern Flank as Romania or attempt to defend against the Japanese as the Phillipines, there is always a new nation to play.\nJoin a faction or attempt world domination, it is your choice.","March 2, 2015","true","906.0"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","24","24","3","1"

Created by Paradox Interactive, the game starts in January 1936 with your selected nation from the Allied or Axis, and win dominations of your choosing. Want to play Germany? Go ahead and research technology before everybody else and invade nations before they can stand a chance. Play as the United States? Declare war against Japan before they can strike against your interests and prevent them from dominating Asia before Japan can even start conquering them. These scenarios are one of the very few that has an endless of possibilities, bringing up the replay value with maximum outcome. What surprises me the most is how complex the game is, like diplomacy, research, production, and a whole lot of other factors that you can think of for a strategy game. Regardless of the game's strong presentation, Hearts of Iron III has its flaws...particuarly of game crashes, little patches that brings little outcome, and a very steep learning curve with a failure of basic tutorials that cannot teach or instruct well. In addition, the game is ONLY recommended to those who are interested in general history, military history, political science, and/or in social sciences. Reason is mainly because many gamers are not interested in these subjects and the game only appeals to small audience (mentioned in the previous sentence). It is not a discouragment, but an understanding of how tolerant that you are willing to play the game since the main gameplay element is seeing "boxes" move around the global map with a strong emphasis on military tactics, like coordinating strategy in a military map. I would not be surprised if anyone would say the game sucks because of ignorance and expect a lot of action (because of the stupidity of the Call of Duty generation). Again, this game is NOT for everyone and those who actually play a good amount of othe strategy games like Total War series, this game is very different from the others. If you are actually interested in the game, I strongly suggest for you to watch Youtube videos on the gameplay to see if it is suitable to your game interest. If not, then it is not for you. Only recommendation is for gamers with strong interests in social sciences and military.","August 8, 2013","true","36.7"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

The gameplay is deep; running through a year of wartime often requires dropping the speed several steps. Taking care to keep forces equipped with the latest weaponry and in supply range is difficult, but nowhere near impossible; if anything, it's almost pleasing to be both general and logistician.\n\nThe real issue, however, is stability. It's rare to be able to complete a whole game in one sitting, even as a neutral power that never gets involved in a war. Particularly when playing a major power, the game is unstable and prone to crashing. Monthly autosaves alleviate some of the frustration, but long load-times compound the problem and rob it of some of the entertainment value. The fun is bulletproof, but only so long as it remains stable.\n\nCrusader Kings II might prove to be a better option for someone looking for a general strategy game; Hearts of Iron IV is listed as in-development, so I might consider that a better option if it turns out to be stable.","October 21, 2014","true","32.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","1"

A major boost to industry for Yugoslavia.\n\n-April 11th, 1938: With the two new battleships in the Yugoslav fleet, CJMN Sarajevo, and CJMN Zagreb, the Yugoslavian Army, Navy, and Air Force launch a coordinated attack on all Greek VP's. Greece falls to Yugoslavia with little fighting.\n\n-December 19th, 1938: The Yugoslavian armed forces are presented with a tempting target, the lone Italy, who has not joined Germany, and relations have since deteriorated. With the initial attacks, the Italian navy lost almost, if not all of its transports, and so more than 80% of their forces were trapped in Italy's colonies. Yugoslavians overwhelm Italian forces, and so, the Mediterranean  sea is almost mastered.\n\n-September 1st, 1939: Germany rolls through Poland. WW2 begins officially.\n\n-May 2nd, 1940: Germany recently broke the Maginot line, and has since pummeled France. France surrenders after Paris falls.\n\n-February 11th, 1941: Germany takes Czechoslovakia with force.\n\n-October 20th, 1941: After what seems like a mutual coalition of both war participants and non participants, Germany's national unity wavers below 30%.\n\n-October 25th, 1941: Germany invades Denmark, who's independence is supported by the mighty power of Yugoslavia. Thus, Yugoslavia is dragged into war, where they swiftly take German VP's, and so, Yugoslavia liberates a new Poland, the old France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Czechoslovakia, but keep the German Territories. By joining the allies, along with Republican Spain and Finland, the only nation that Yugoslavia had the ambition to take on, was the Soviet Union.......\n\n\n\nAftermath: The Allies were called in on the war with the Soviet Union. They were all too happy to oblige. With the initial lull in fighting, the Allies started gaining momentum, where soon, Leningrad had fallen, followed by Moskva, and finally, the Soviets broke, when the last major VP was taken. The result was a huge gain of territory for Poland, Finland, ans especially Yugoslavia. When Sinkiang was eventually put down after a year of fighting, the Japanese were the only force foolish enough to stand in the way of the allied Powers. Progress was swift, and so Yugoslavia was the greatest power the world had known.

In Hearts of Iron III that could be anyone!\n\nThis game is very frightening at first, as the tutorials in the game doesn't care for a new player as myself.\nSo quite some time is needed to be spent on viewing tutorial videos on FailTube.\nAnd even those forget to tell you the basic things you need to get started.\nAlso the UI* isn't exactly friendly to begin with!\n\nA better paradox than this I don't believe exists, Hearts of Iron III being the most advanced strategy game I've played, with the lousiest tutorials** I've encountered in a great while...\nThus the name Paradox Interactive perhaps?\n\nYou who played Axis and Allies will see similarities because Hearts of Iron III is AAA on steroids.\nThere are some things I don't like with the game because it is very strict on terms of history.\nEven if you assist Finland in pushing out the Russians during the Winter war, the truce is written and Finland lose what was lost.\nSo basically playing the non major powers seems a little off.\n\nHearts of Iron III is focused on land combat, with order of battle for the armies, but it doesn't have a similar hierarchy for the navy or air force, which I feel very strange.\n\nDespite this I won't look at other strategy games the same way again because this has it all!\nYou have to make up a strategy for how you will spend your resources in the most efficient way, what units you can and can't build, what technology you need to prioritise.***\nYou have to think carefully of how you place your units during and setup of combat so you don't get encircled and get your resource lines cut off.\nHearts of Iron III has some advanced combat rules which can either win or lose you the conflict.\nThe trade system makes sense with prices being depending on what relation you have to the nation you're trading with.\nPoliticians are stupid as usual with moronic traits such as "-5% money". Some other politicians have good traits, but you can't really form your government the way you want as you're not playing as a politician.\n\nI'm happy that I took the time to learn how to play this game and when I did get into it I was possessed by Gustav II Adolf, and that's where I am now, hell bent on reacquiring lost territory...\nOh and yes, this game is very addicting.\n------------------------\nSecond thoughts.\nEven tho' I recommend this game there are some things which you should consider.\nIt's old, so it doesn't work on newer computers with graphic glitches, lag and CTDs.\n(Paradox Interactive requires you to register the game on their site to get their technical support site. But I'm not sending my CD-key onto a site without SSL)\nThe AI is incredibly stupid when it attacks, you have to control every aspect of combat with the "attack/defend here" thing, which is tedious...\nThe Russians have dive bombers with unlitmited range...\n213 hours as of today was mostly fun, but too frustrating in the end.\n\n* Before I realised how to select some and not all units from a stack I spent hours arranging my armies.\n** Then again I remember a time 17 or so years ago where you had to turn the manual inside out to understand how to use the manual. Time has changed, but not at Paradox Interactive.\n*** This is especially vital if you play minor countries such as I did.","March 13, 2015","true","212.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","1"

Very deep mechanics and too many stuff to learn, not easy but certainly not impossible. Taking away the mods, is limited when it comes to play in a sandbox way; although you have certain degree of freedom, some things just won't happen, that is in historic terms. As for technology and military focus you really are the ruler of your country: whether as Germany you start focusing on building a decent Kriegsmarine or as Japan on building tanks to send them to support you Italian ally in Africa.\n\nI think the game can suit your gamestyle depending on how much micromanagement you want to do or simply if you just want to FF the game only watching how your armies advance. Personally, I try to balance between both: invading the Soviets with Germany I prefer to go fight by fight meanwhile for crushing China with the Japs I just let it go faster or also checking from time to time how is the US fleet managing to stop the Japanese advance.\n\nCertainly a game that needs tons of time and pacience (that also still depends on your gameplay). The only major setback is the bloody problem that crashes it almost every 20 minutes almost every time, and although it is said that there is a fix on the dev's page, is not precisely the word straightfoward on how to fix it.\n\n\nOverall 8/10 because of that damn issue.\n\nP.S.

There are some workarounds floating around on the forums, pointing to a non-existing paradox forum, so I wasn't able to test them.

The game is defintely not for the faint hearted as it has a decent learning curve and can be very hit and miss with whether or not you enjoy it. The game is defintely aimed at fans of the grand strategy genre and the second world war. For a game made in 2009 its definitely aged well and still has a fairly active player base with around 200-800 players at any one time.\n\nThe game itself involves you controlling any nation in the world from early 1936 through the second world war up until 1946. During this period players mostly control the production and operations of their vast militaries. However diplomacy, espionage and trade does play a role (albeit a small one). Players control units right from Brigade level up to Theatre commands and Army Groups. I highly recommend purchasing all of the expansions for the game as they expand upon the games great model and bring some really useful additions. You dont need the skin pack dlcs but these can be useful for those wishing to increase the level of immersion, but I know that I personally tended to just stick to using regular counters.\n\nOnce you've had enough of the regular vanilla game there are also many many community created mods which allow for endless oppertunities to experiment and game. These include such mods as the WW1 mod, Black Ice mod and the Modern Warfare mod.\n\nWhile this game does have a large learning curve and does not sport the most interesting of user interfaces it defintely does the genre proud. I would rate HOI3 a solid 9/10.","March 28","true","238.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Furthermore, most people who like one Paradox game seem to like most or all of them, as they are almost all different takes on the grand strategy genre. I am a fan of other Paradox games I have played, namely Hearts of Iron II and Europa Universalis IV, but I found Hearts of Iron III to be buggy and unmanagably complicated. Complicated with a capital C. For example, you'll be creating order-of-battle hierarchies that take into account things like HQ placements and radio range, micro-managing logistics and supply routes, etc. Like other Paradox games, the tutorial is woefully inadequate, but unlike other Paradox games I've tried, there just wasn't enough fun in the early stages for me to push through the steep learning curve. People say the expansions do a lot to mitigate the problems with the base game, and I don't doubt it, but if the game needs these expansions so badly, they should've been released as patches, not as paid content.\n\nIf you enjoy extremely deep and realistic war games and don't mind bugs, this just might end up being one of your favorite games of all time. If you find micromanagement tedious, it probably won't be. I have spent literally hundreds of hours on Paradox games, mostly playing Darkest Hour and Europa Universalis IV with my friends, but this game just kind of left me feeling a bit overwhelmed by choice, and underwhelmed with fun.","December 26, 2013","false","9.4"," 53 of 93 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","53","93","0","1"

I had originally got the Hearts of Iron III Collection + Their Finest Hour DLC + 'Arsenal of Democracy: A Hearts of Iron Game' on sale on Gamersgate a couple weeks ago since it was so cheap and I've never tried a Grand Strategy before.\n\nI was very impressed. While it loads a bit slowly on single state drives(at least I think that's the term), it was an amazing game. The Scale is huge. Each Continent and each Sea is made up of Provinces, which works much like the Hex Grid from Civilization V, but less uniform. But in Hearts of Iron III there are over 10,000 Provinces, and only a very small number of that is the seas. Like I said, the scale is huge.\n\nIt takes place during World War 2, and you can play any nation that existed at that time. And all the events that happened in real life during that time frame, also happen in the game, though you'll only see it if you're playing as the nation it happened too, or a nation also affected by it. But other than that, things can go any number of ways. Things tend to drift towards what happened in history, but other than UK always being Allies, Germany always being Axis, and the Soviets always being Consortium, any nation can join any faction potentially, or even remain neutral. Wanna play as Japan and seduce Mexico and Canada to the Axis and nail Murica'(‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yeah!) in a 3-way? It might take a little while, but it's certainly possible.\n\nThere is a huge tech tree also, though I won't get into that.\n\nThere are also many unit types, and a very detailed military hierarchy, and an extremely large amount of room for tactics.\n\nThis game, and pretty much any other Paradox Interactive and/or Grand Strategy game, is very difficult to get into though, due to the steep learning curve. Even now I'm still getting the hang of the game, though I'm loving every moment. I recommend watching Michael Broschek's tutorial on the basics, which helped me immensely. Here's the linky link.\n\nAlso, this game is best played with all it's expansion packs, which are 'Semper Fi', 'For the Motherland', and 'Their Finest Hour', in that order of release. You also need the previous expansion to play the next. To clarify: You need the base game, Hearts of Iron III in order to play Semper Fi. You need Semper Fi in order to play For the Motherland. And finally, you need For the Motherland to play Their Finest Hour. All the other DLC's are mostly cosmetic, so you can have all armies have the appearance their real army had at that time period.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this to any Grand Strategy fan, Paradox Interactive fan, or a Strategy fan looking for something much, MUCH deeper.","December 31, 2014","true","9.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Not saying it's bad, just different and some people may not like it.\nThe Combat system got a lot complicated, Technologies too. But theres a catch...\nIf you don't like any of these new features or are just starting out you can put individual parts of country into AI hands, which helps a ton if you are just learning the game.\n\nI consider the HOI series one of the hardests off the Parados titles so this game made it a lil bit easier to start I think, especially with the AI features.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/karnovo/recommended/25890/","karnovo","Karnovo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/karnovo/","394 products in account","Hearts of Iron 3 is without a doubt, the most in-depth WAR game ever made. If you've never played a paradox before, you'll be in for a major surprise. It took me roughly a month of every day play to "master" all of the basics. The tutorials are woefully inadequate and a complete waste of time, but the strategy guide is a gem and the paradox forum is an excellent resource. To ease your learning, parts of the game can be automated. Anything you have to do can be assigned to a highly sophisticated AI; it is possible to delegate every task to the AI, or just the ones you aren't yet familiar with so you can take things one step at a time.\n\nThe breadth and scope of HOI3 is enormous. You can pick any country in the world from Germany to Tannu Tava (I never heard of it before, either) and the developers have done an excellent job modelling historical limitations, while not restricting flexibility. HOI3 is essentially a war game, unlike other paradox games. Its focus is just that, with only the minimum necessary attention to the homefront. Battle, however, is beautiful. There are so many different brigade considerations, such as toughness (how many casualties does it take?), soft attack (infantry attack), hard attack (tank battles basically), defensiveness, organization (how much damage a brigade can take before retreating), strength (how much damage can it inflict), etc. You have the ability to craft each brigade and assign its leaders, all the way through the chain. A well-organized army enjoys significant benefits over one without proper leadership. The bread-and-butter of any army are infantry, and I highly advise tacking on an artillery brigade to each infantry division. Each unit draws supplies, and fuel in the case of mechanical ones, from your base. The supply system has serious flaws, however, but recent patches and independent fixes remedy this issue. In addition, Paradox has added an arcade version that ignores supply routes. What fun is that, though? All it takes to turn the tide of war is to bomb your enemy's choke points, and bam! -50% battle penalty and no reinforcement to the front lines. Indeed, supply lines/routes will make or break you, especially when playing as a sea-faring nation, such as Japan.\n\nBattle itself is effected by the values I mentioned before, plus many others. What's the weather in the province? A wise man doesn't invade India in the middle of a monsoon. Combat width determines the space of your battle, and frontage determines how much space each unit takes. The more space it occupies, the more it attacks in a round but the less each attack does. A unit with small frontage and high combat is ideal, though armored units operate oppositely. Tanks rely on a high frontage to rush enemy lines. There are "events" in battle, like "Ambush!" or "Breakthrough!" that give benefits to one of the belligerents. You can increase your chance of getting a beneficial event through researching doctrines, which are highly useful because they improve your army without using your IC (Industrial Capacity, each country's industrial output). Battle lasts until one side runs out of organization or strength, though the former comes first 95% of the time. Air/naval battles are represented well. Planes play a huge role, despite costing an arm-and-a-leg to produce. Smaller countries often can't afford to field a division of tactical bombers, but for bigger ones when you already have enough infantry, it will determine the course of many battles. Navies are optional for land-based countries, such as the Soviet Union, but absolutely critical to survival for the UK or Japan, the latter of which is forced to fight a multi-front war with a small manpower pool, few resources, and no nearby allies and a vulnerable homeland.\n\nThe world is divided into factions: Allies, Axis, Comintern, although one can be unallied. Each has its perks, but Axis are the easiest (and imo, most fun) to play. On top of that, each country poses unique challenges that model history. The Soviet Union has a gigantic manpower pool, but a disorganized army and a stalling industrial base. Germany enjoys significant boosts from '36 to '39 in its industrial output to prepare for the war ahead, yet becomes very strained in the east. The USA is the powerhouse of the game, yet can barely build a proper guard army until '42. Whatever country you pick, know your strengths and weaknesses. Building a major tank force with Argentina, for example, would be foolish. Tanks aren't well-suited to the jungles, and that money could go toward building a decent infantry base. Similarly, research only the techs you need. The basic infantry ones require only 4 research points, but planes require vastly more. Some countries just can't catch up to the giants like the US or Germany. That isn't a fault of the game, it's just history (although you can expand significantly; I have played a game with The Netherlands where I conquered over 10x my original area).\n\nWhatever path you choose in HOI3, you're in for the most thought-provoking game you have ever played.","September 21, 2014","true","330.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Pretty damn good\nFor example, Tanks will be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in mountains and thus move and attack worse when positioned/traveling through them, but trusty mountain troops on the other hand are great at that stuff, but mounties are crap against tanks on an open field, unless they have back up or the tanks they face are technologically backwards and the mounties' country did some fine research on Infantry Anti-Tank weapons, but nevermind! The tanks are cut off thanks to the quick work of the brave Calvary units, now the mounties are on the offensive!\nThere's also combat width, unit weight for transporting across the seas, and even morale, organization, and attack levels of units, there's paratroopers, V2 missiles, V2 Interceptors, Battleships, Super heavy battleships, light tanks, heavy tanks, super heavy tanks, super duper heavy tanks (I kid), Armored cars, submarines, Carriers, Military Police, Naval, Tactical, and strategic bombers, and nuclear weapons.\nBack to the game, you can also assign Units to AI HQs who will then move on the impulse of what the AI thinks is good to do.\nYou can assign wargoals after/during the declaration of war, and once a country's national unity is lower than the amount of its important cities are taken, it will surrender, for example if Poland braves Germany and invades them by sea, nuking Berlin thrice in the process, and Germany loses a lot of important cities to the Poles, Germany will surrender once the percent of important cities taken are more than the German national unity, which would be low due to all that nuking.\nUnlike Victoria 2 or other Paradox titles, games go by not by days but by hours, making 10 years in HOI3 seem like 50 in Vic2, games are usually longer than the 1948 end and sometimes require going into the files and making the game end in 2005 or whenever, just to see how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up the world can get, if Japan ever annexes Australia, if Ireland ever conquers Germany, if Haiti ever nukes Hiroshima.\nAlong with this, there are in-game events that occur that mirror historical ones, like the Crashing of the Hindenburg, the loss of Amelia Earhart at sea, the final construction of the Pentagon, the White Death during the Winter war, the first atomic bomb dropped on another nation, and so on.\nIf you've played other Paradox games and wanna try your hand at conquering rather than colonizing, try out Hearts of Iron 3, you'll enjoy it.","November 30, 2014","true","907.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

People love to complain that its graphics are bland or unimpressive, but those people are looking for an RTS or shooter with lots of eye candy. This game is all about the grand strategy. Others may complain about the AI not being smart enough, but they overlook the fact that this is the best grand strategy AI ever written for a PC game and no PC based AI is ever going to be a match for a decently operated human mind. Now the specifics:\n\nStandalone game: somewhat buggy, some serious design limitations that impede some aspects of smooth game play. might wear out your mouse button with all the micromanagement required to play a whole game to the end. 3/5 stars\n\nGame with all expansions: very few bugs at all; added management tools and AI delegation options reduce the micro-management clickfest of the vanilla version to a level much easier to handle; custom game mode (CGM) from final expansion adds whole new worlds of replayability once you exhaust your options with the already incredible scope of possibilities. 5/5 stars without reservation - all time best of this class. Its only rivals for that distinction might be other recent titles from Paradox, e.g. Europa Universalis IV, though that would be partly a matter of personal taste, of course.\n\nIf you are a casual gamer, stay away from this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trotskyism/recommended/25890/","Trotskyism","Pompination","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trotskyism/","192 products in account","Hearts of Iron III is an excellent game. One of Paradox's best strategy games, in my opinion, it allows the player to control any nation in the lead-up to WW2, or during it if you prefer. These range from Nazi Germany, of course, to the Dominican Republic, which gives you an idea of the level of choice on offer. The game essentially drops you into the world as head-of-state of one of these many nations, and it's entirely up to you what to do from there: will you align with the Axis in Europe to gain your share of the economic gains in the upcoming war? Or will you side with Stalin's Russia and work to undermine Fascism and the Allies, in an attempt to dominate the world with Communism?\n\nHowever, the level of historical accuracy in HOI3 is astounding, despite the player's ability to make independent and alternate choices. For example, there is a system of "decisions" in the game which often provide some sort of benefit, one of which is the historical Anschluss of Austria for Germany. As well as this, there are literally thousands of officers, with their own traits and skill levels (which can be improved with combat), to assign to command your divisions or brigades. These are just two examples in an intricate web of historical detail. WW2 history buffs like myself will be elated at the opportunity to not only, for example, command Rommel's Afrika Korps, but lead it to complete victory in the Middle East! Again, this is just an example that popped into my head, the level of possibility is insane.\n\nAside from the military aspect of the game, which is the focus, there are various other sectors of your nation that you can alter control. There is the politics tab, where you select your ministers and make policies, as well as administer the areas that have come under your occupation through war. There is the diplomacy tab, where, if you are a leader of a faction, such as the Axis, you can influence nations to join you in alliance, and make trade deals, sell equipment, declare war, ETC. Other tabs include research, production, intelligence. I won't go into detail on these, but all are as important as each other.\n\nAnyway, pros and cons:\n\nPROS\n- Insanely high level of historical detail (accurate divisional names, commanders, ministers in governments, literally tens of thousands of provinces)\n- Ability to relive or rewrite history, in your own unique way.\n- Greatly immersive, you get to the point where hours just slip away in what feels like minutes!\n- Huge scale wars, on land sea, and air, where you are the commander in chief.\n\nCONS\n- Not recommended if the player is looking for amazing graphics- the gameplay is what sells HOI3, not the visuals.\n- A tad buggy. The game crashes relatively frequently, especially if tinkering around in console commands.\n- Steep learning curve, but once you get the full hang of it, you'll realise it was well worth the time put into it.\n\n9/10 The cons do not affect my opinion of the game significantly in any way, and I hope that you too will be persuaded by this long-winded review to buy this awesome game too!","November 8, 2014","true","361.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Every level of command can now be assigned an AI to simply the sometimes unmanageable big armies and while this seems like a nice feature I can't help but feel much like I did the first time played Master of Orion 3. Out of control.\n\nParadox has also, like with EU3, taken as much determinism out of the game as possible and while this opens up the gameplay quite a bit it also increases the chance of games that never get going when some of the big players never enter the fray.\n\nA great game but I still like Hearts of Iron II better.","November 11, 2012","true","299.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Then send it spies to ruin their party and make other parties more strong, however good luck with that. :)\n\nIf you wish to have a friend to play with, you're able to do that, however be aware that the servers are not up anymore and you will be forced to host your own server through port-fowarding or using a program such as Hamachi, playing online is very interesting and is often more difficult due to the AI sometimes being very predictable.\n\nThe game does suffer from bugs, game crashes and HUD bugs are very common and get worse the longer you play for one session. If the game does not even launch, it is often Steam or your system and a reinstall is very handy. Game crashes seem to get worse the longer you use a constant game copy, reinstalling this game every time crashes become common is a good idea and modding the game can also cause crashes, however I would reccomend the WW1 mod.\n\nI full-heartly reccomend this amazing game, with over 600 hours on Steam and much more off Steam, it helped me learn more in-depth about World War 2 and made me truly see the effects of the war.\n\n9/10\n+Unique game with much replayability\n+ Extremly In-depth if you want it to be\n+ Able to attack a country through unique ways\n+ Great moding community with WW1 mods to game enhancing mods such as ICE\n-  Bugs, often forcing a reinstall after a unknown period of time\n- No official servers","June 21, 2014","true","122.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Meanwhile The US puts a embargo on the Axis powers but is then attacked by the allies!!!!! so there is currently a atlantic war raging between the USA and The Allies. Mexico which has joined the axis has taken many british holdings in central america and a showdown between brazil and argentina looks very likely as argentina rockets towards the axis and brazil to the allies.\n\nIn europe Germany has decided NOT to invade poland. and has instead conquered france and formed a vichy france 3 times bigger then it was historically. While taking down denmark. Im not quite sure what they are planning since its 1939 and they should have attacked poland by then. Ireland joined the axis and was then completely destroyed by Britain sadley. And finally in oceania Australia and New Zealand join the axis and fight the neatherlands in new guniea.

I enjoyed playing as different nations and infuencing history to try and swing WW2 events in different directions.\n\nHowever the game is showing its age badly. If you don't use the Paradox support forum and try to fix all the issues the game will crash to desktop constantly. Even if you install the fixes that the support forum suggests I found that it is still no guarentee the game won't crash.\n\nI worked for 3 hours trying to solve the crashing issue and I still found that after a certain amount of time the game would still stop working and crash. Playing this game is not only trying to win WW2 but a war of attrition to keep the game running and make sure your save game works.\n\nEven the big fans of this game I've seen do let's plays of HOI3 have had issues with it despite obviously spending a long time patching it. If you play the game for extended periods and have a lot of units on the screen it begins to lag horrendusly. The UI will start to break and show no numbers. You have to re-start the game at that point. Which is a pretty big inconveniance.\n\nFor the technical reasons I can't give this game a positive review. The game is pretty much broken at this point because of its age. If you want to buy a WW2 grand strategy game just wait for Hearts of Iron 4.","February 17","false","3.1"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","1"

Unfortunately, I also found the game to be extremely unstable*, and very heavy on micro-managing huge numbers of units, officers, and upgrades, which I really didn't enjoy.\n\nIf you really like the period, and especially if you enjoy micro-managing a large military organisation, then this may still be a great game for you, but in general I cannot recommend HoI3.\n\n*) I got a crash to desktop on average once an hour playing as the USA on a Windows 8.1 machine. Strangely enough, Paradox has produced an .exe that makes the game much more stable, but for some reason it's not in a patch. You have to track it down it on their forums (which require you to first get a Paradox account) and install it manually. :-(","February 5, 2015","false","7.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Despite most of the game being looking at a map, it offers in depth detail into being the government and military of a country with total countrol. Most players find peacetime the most boring time throughout the game, this can be worse if your playing a country like the United States which doesn't enter WW2 for quite sometime. However, people may find it boring during this peace / build phase but if its not thought out well you'll be quickly regretting and possbily restarting because you found that phase unimportant. If you are like me, and love to add flavor of events and hard decisions during peacetime especially and wartime I would highly recommend the Black ICE mod. This mod adds hundereds of historical events and decisions which have major to minimal impact on the game. These events can both be helpful and hurt you but I feel like it makes the games events harder as its not always a easy decision. For those reasons and the diversity of units and divisions that can be accomplished give you a more fun and tough time, as the AI also build more diverse and recieve events just for them to keep them up to par with you. If anyone ever has any questions or thoughts about getting or already has the game and just wants to discuss anything about it I encourage you to message me. As stated above I strongly recommend this game in its vanilla state or its various mods such as Black ICE, HPP and August Storm.","September 13, 2013","true","271.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

The gameplay is great and is really realistic. You can play as any nation you want. However, alot of the interesting ones are either puppets or minor nations. There are basicaly no tutorials since they are all a bunch of text. But its not the hardest thing to master. If your a newbie, put it on "Very Easy", then try. I reccomend starting out as a strong nation (Not USA as its too much of a hassle). If you cannot work out IC or technology or you just want to focus on a war, set them to AI control. Now, vanilla is great as is, but you still require to use cheats to get the full experience. The only cheat I reccomend is "Noneutrality", it removes your neutrality, so you dont have to wait five years to get lower neutrality. Overall, it is worth $10. Unlike Civ 5's expensive nature for a lackluster vanilla, its worth it without the DLC. The DLC just make the game feel more immersive.","October 6, 2014","true","171.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

Sure HoI III has pretty graphics and some overpriced Unit packs....but come on, is that really all you care about?\n\nHearts of Iron III lacks most key events for WWII, as in barely any events are in the game. They try to justify this by saying its supposed to be a 'sandbox' even though that doesn't make any sense. First off; they are perfectly capable of writing up branching event paths that allow for alternative history like they did for the previous games in the series. This seems like an attempt to appeal to a new audiance that failed horribly.\n\nAmong the events missing are some of the most important to include, like the aftermath of WWII! In addition there are missing mechancs like land trading and claiming that are absent from this game that are badly needed, there is also a lack of nations and alternative nations and ministers in the game too. And don't even get me started on the map. They also removed a lot of key bookmarks that are present in other games.\n\nThe few features that are new or improved are poorly implimented or completely broken.\n\nI recommend you wait to see if HoI IV is any better or buy Darkest Hour.","December 6, 2014","false","218.0"," 33 of 61 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","33","61","0","2"

At first, the game is very overwhelming, and it may seem extremely confusing, but my suggestion is to watch some YouTube series' on the game first, this way you can understand what you need to do, and the crucial stradegies of the game. Another essiential in my opinion is the Black Ice mod. This mod makes the game heaps better, and adds tons of new elements to the game which make it feel even more immersive, Black Ice doesn't tally your game time on Steam though, so be wary of that, this is why I have such a low amount time played on the game.\n\nOverall, I really recommend this game for anyone who enjoys hardcore stradegy, this game does a great job of making the player feel like he is really running the military side of a country, the game is extremely addictive too.

But once you got it, it will be well worth it!\n\nI've got up to a 1000h on the vanilla version and although that's a damn lot of wasted time for a game.

You can do that. Want to name yourself Tony Abbott in-game and destroy Australia from the inside-out? You can do that too.\n\nIt's a bit lengthy depending on where you start, but the results are definitely worth it. You can get some hilarious results, like South Africa attacking Italy or Germany.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DovahkiinCroatia/recommended/25890/","DovahkiinCroatia","Dovahkiin=Croatia=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DovahkiinCroatia/","73 products in account","where does one start with a game as conceptually hugamungus as this? Playing Hearts of Iron can be mentally taxing, intimidating, and utterly compelling all at the same time, and there‚Äôs no easy way to ‚Äòsum it up‚Äô. But for want of a better topic, we‚Äôll focus on what‚Äôs new, the most obvious being the graphics. Using an entirely new engine, Hearst of Iron III has been brought visually more in line with Paradox‚Äôs other flagship title, Europa Universalis III, making a shift from 2D to 3D. Counters, whilst still present at a certain level of magnification, have been replaced by generic 3D sprites to represent the different kinds of military units. The world map itself has been giving colour and life, with the different land types been visually represented. The only flaw to be had here is that the developers seem to have gotten rid of a lot of the urbanised areas, which is a shame because urban fighting was a major hallmark of this conflict.\n\nNot only are the graphics better, but the game ‚Äòworld‚Äô has gotten bigger. Just as Empire: Total War shrunk the number of land provinces available to conquer, so have Paradox increased them, to the tune of around 14,000. That, coupled with the 100 + playable nations, means that this game is clearly the largest yet.\n\nThe other ‚Äòbig‚Äô changes are mainly to do with the AI and player interface. With a new streamlined military organisation system in the form of official ‚Äòheadquarter‚Äô units, it‚Äôs possible to ‚Äòassign‚Äô the AI to various parts of your army. Whilst useless in combat, HQ units provide structure to sometimes unmanageably huge armies, and posse‚Äôs different levels, the top being the ‚ÄòTheatre‚Äô command. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre playing as Germany, and World War II is about to start. Don‚Äôt fancy managing both the Easter and Western fronts? Simply tell the AI to control one of them. Assign it overall goals and objectives, and you can pretty much leave it be. Whilst the AI seems to get slightly dumber the lower down the command chain you go, it nevertheless proves to be a decently made system, and is definitely one of the games strong points.\n\nIndeed, this idea of AI control is a subtle theme running through the game, as you can assign pretty much everything to the AI, with minimal input. Reminiscent of Nintendo‚Äôs up-coming ‚ÄòDemo play‚Äô feature, it begs to question why anyone would want to simply watch the game being played, but sectioning off certain areas to the AI‚Äôs commands can certainly make things easier on players who find the level of depth intimidating. There are a whole host of other minor improvements as well, such as the ability to customize divisions (the basic military unit of a game) mixing and matching the various brigades to form dynamic and diverse armies. However, most of these you will have to find out for yourself.","April 2, 2014","true","100.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I knew the Central American Theatre heated up after the Axis Powers invited Mexico into their faction with open arms but I didn't think it was this bad. Though i grew up in Amarillo, a town just a few hours away, i had fond memories of that city, and now i didn't even want to ponder on what it would look like with all of its buildings reduced to rubble and its clean streets littered with blast craters.\n\nI let my mind linger on my home just a few measly miles from the front and what those Spanish b******* would really fight like if they weren't supplied with fresh panzers and small arms from Germany. I cut off those thoughts as not to distract me from what was hapenning now, and instead focused my thoughts on the bitter cold. Sitting in a foxhole with wet soil was bad enough, but the blisters on my hand from breaking apart the cement and digging what I thought might be my grave in the next few hours really stung in the brisk winter air. It sure was cold up North, we were hurried up here last week. I was in Sicily when the Krauts and what was left of the Italian army pushed us back out on the same path we blazed through the countryside. Operation Overlord was supposed to take some of the heat off of us but the krauts coastal defense gun fire was so heavy that the invasion never began. One of my long-time friends told me earlier in the week that the Germans used the same guns on their shores that we do, he has a history of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tting so he's probably just pulling my leg.\n\nA quick inspection of my M1 Garand appeased the creeping fear of any imperfection that could indanger its performance. My Garand truely is a weapon of beauty, just like The Old Man said, and sure beats those old Springfields that some poor old boys are being issued from stockpiles, but it can still seize up like any firearm. This here gun was by my side in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and almost into Germant before they pushed us back. I've been hearing some talk around the company that a new rifle is being tested thats based off of those German paratrooper guns, the fallshrimp-whatcha-ma-call-them. I didn't care though, I liked my dusty old gun all the same.\n\nI decided to stand up and stretch to get my blood flowing, some coffee would have been nice but the Army doesn't value us enough to prioritize its transportation. I looked around the dark city street that was just being illuminated by the rising sun. These tall buildings weren't unheard of around Amarillo, h***, Houston "had" some but they were easily dwarfed by these monstrosities. A glimmer of light revealed the big red "1" on my shoulder as i turned to face the harbor. It normally would have been a breathtaking sight if it wasn't for the silhouettes of 6 H-class battleships with support vessels looming like a storm cloud. Just staring at them made me nervous. They decimated our 5th fleet 2 weeks ago, it was our last Atlantic fleet. A sigh escaped my lips as i sat back down to check on the M2 and wake my friend Joe. Joe was from these parts and on our rare walks around the city he'd recount memories from his childhood and old spots he spent with 5 of the loves of his life, supposedly each one hotter than the last. I shook him awake and he retorted with an irratable "whaddya want, tough guy?". I always told him he talked funny and he always countered with a "Can it, cowboy", new additions to our unit always assumed we hated each other but thats just how best friends joke, we refused to turn to that dark humor the other guys resorted to.\n\nHe dug into his pocket and hand with 2 sticks of gum. Tossing one to me, he asked if anything new sprung up. I didn't wish to go back to my pessimistic thoughts of home so i just told him that things were quiet. Our daily conversation of "which babe is better" or "how far do you think I can hit this-or-that" began as if it to was apart of our routine, if you can count sitting on your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all day in the name of freedom a routine.\n\nAfter roughly 45 minutes of chatting we quited back down. I decided to return to my Playboy magazine as he started scrubbing his rifle.\n\n"I swear man, as the war drags on, these women, get uglier."\n\n"Yeah, that's because the Jerry's got all the nice broads."\n\n"I guess so....hey man can you stop humming?"\n\n"What? I was 'bout to ask you the same thing."\n\n"Well one of us has got to cut it out."\n\n"Stop lying man you stupid son of a-"\n\nKAPOW\n\nAs a wave of dust washed over us, an air raid siren began to wail.

The inter-twined connections that just the technology section alone makes a newcomer to the Civilization-esk game genre very overwhelmed, very quickly. I know I was.\n\nBut, once you read up on a game's mechanics ( Gasp! This is 2015, I don't want to actually read how to play a game somewhere outside the game! Hold my hand and show me the way!) things become much clearer and even if you haven't read the entire wiki like I have, you can kinda figure stuff out on your own.\n\nThis game allows event he most fanatical of WW2 fanboys to squeal with joy at the historical events taking place in your games. It also allows WW2 fanboys to live out your most amazing/hilarious alternate history ideas in a world so deep, you'd mistake that you where the president of the US.\n\nNow for my Good, Bad and, Ungly section.\n\nThe Good  The complexity of this game has yet to be matched by any game I have played thus far.\nThe menus are layed out in a nice fasion and automatically close whenver you open something else.\nThis game will impress any history buff, regardless of specific period they like, as the detail to history is fenominal\nThis is a great game to really slow down and think, you can make it as fast or as slow as you want\nThe Bad   The game lacks polished graphics and would benifit from them amazingly\n(Haven't bought any DLC, I'm talking about the stock game)\nNot being able to make some decisions because the game requires another condition to be met was frustrating\n(for example, not being able to change your economy because you wanted to stay neutral but you have to go to war in order to mobilize)\nHaving to research a unit's basic requirements was wholy unnessicary\n(some units had half of their stats missing because one perticular technology wasn't reasearched)\nThe Ugly  The UI is horribly outdated and just bad on the eyes, I feel like this is the original SimCity\n(as sated before, a bit of a graphical polish would amp this game's general apeal way up and would make more people at least try it, I recommended this game to a friend and he said "It looks so menu intensive and full of data; it just doesn't look like my game.")\nAs stated by the people over at Extra Credits, this game does not hand-hold in any shape or form\n(there is a bit of a tutorial but it barely scratches the surface of whatt his game has to offer and it still leaves a newcomer alienated.)\nThere's just so much information not given to you, it's hard to fully grasp what everything does untill it's too late\n(the detail windows that pop up when you hover over ceratain things need to have more actual, and more literal, descriptions of what exactly things do)\nAnd for all you Reddit junkies out there:\n\nTL;DR:\nThis is an immensly complex game which will not only immerse you in detail and content, it will drown you in it. The UI and the game in general feeld oudated because of the lack of graphical polish and optimization. With this deep world comes a dificulty curve that's so steep, it's essentally a brick wall; but once you climb over it, the reward is almost priceless.","March 20, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Recommend all expansions.  I've played HOI and HOI II and find HOI III to be an improvement.  Amazingly sophisticated yet simple to use.  The ability to automate functions makes gameplay much less time consuming and you can even run the game in the background while you are doing something else, set to pause when criteria you establish happens where it will await your input.  In this way you can let the computer handle some of the load.  Or, if you prefer, you can do it all-- politics, espionage, military, diplomacy, trade, technological research and national infrastructure.  The game has the three main factions of WWII, the Allies, the Axis, and the Comintern but you can play as any nation on Earth.   Extraordinary amount of freedom yet within a tight game balance.  If you've ever played the old Avalon Hill boardgame 'Third Reich' you will love this game.","December 26, 2011","true","643.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I know as a gamer that two naval forts are better then one, but in terms of game mechanics i have no way to guage it on my own. it will usually say +2 from fort. plus two to what? defence? hard attack? soft attack? naps? it has so many numbers and stats flying everywhere that it forgets to properly explain most of them, even in the tutorials.\n-navy. this sorta goes with aircraft feeling useless. during the second world war, the british empire quickly found out that the battleship was not longer the king of the ocean, after one of theres was sunk minutes after leaving port for the first time. but not here. because aircraft feels so useless, it come down to min maxing your ship composition, it takes a year or more to build one aircraft carrior (which yes i know it takes a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ton of time to build a ship) not to mention the upgrades to make it worth a damn, which take up valuble time that you could use for upping production. i have been able to win several games with only building destroyers and light cruisers, maxing out there weapons and armor, and building them on mass. because much like the air combat, it  feels poorly done.\n-casulties. very small complaint, battles feel.... incredibly small scale. if i send an army of say... 20,000 infantry and a few thousand artillary pieces against the same amount of infantry, once the battle is over, you will most likely have only last a handfull of men, a few hundread, maybe. i understand its ust numbers, but it makes historical events feel so small. landing on a heavily defended beach? eh.... 200 dead. firebombing capital as your military marches over it? 20 dead. as i said, its incredibly small scale, but in a game so indepth, i would expect them to pay attention to those small details. my men in hongkong had full supply, and were dug in as well as possible, had air support, and full moral this should have been a meat grinder for both sides, but my guys throw up there hands after 30 of them drop and leave there fortress of a city. and how many japanese did they take? 56\n-lastly there is a feeling of ultimatly missing somthing. perhaps it could have been fixed by letting me start a few years before it does now, or staying into the early days of the cold war. its just missing somthing. if i drop 14 atom bombs on germany they still wont give up, why? why does an atom bomb not destroy a city completely? why does it barely hurt a military force, only there moral? why can my naval forts not deal slight damage to ships that pass close by them? isnt that what those huge anti ship guns were for? why cant i trash everything as i retreat as russia? and most importantly, why do some of the lesser great powers feel so boring? why does canada play the same as chile? why does norway play the same as communist china? because there missing personal flair. and you might think its impossible to have that, but they have in crusader kings 2. now thats a completely different type of game yeah, but it still lets you have more control to have your own fun. why not let me have a bigger hand in designing my tanks, like choosing from a list of guns, rather then one flat out being better (which they werent) why not let me choose who i conscript for, like my airforce to speed up there recovery like the english did in the battle of britain. hell let me edit my own political party, sure it might not be historically accurate, but the great thing about these games is, its historically accurate up until the player enters the game.\n\n\nnow enough of my complaining. the good.\n+Oh wow them tactics. i still dont get it half the time, numbers slip by you, hard attack vs soft attack, defence bonus, flanking bonus, composition bonus blah blah blah. i dont care.  its an amazing feeling when  you set up the perfect plan to hold back the germans before they can take paris, as you spend every ounce of strength you have to ust barely screech them to a halt. its a fantastic feeling to plan and execute raids on areas to try and liberate them, send a small force to bring greece back into the fight and so on. its great.\n+The tech. oh lordy its amazing.... just... look at it. so indepth, and i love it. 10/10 would get all agriculture again.\n+Freedom of choice. you wanna be mexico? how about poland? why not just play south africa? you can. any nation that was around at the time, play it. love it.\n\nlong story short, there are alot of little things that might ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you off, bt at the end of the day, i have went through all that, and i still find myself turning it back on. because i love it. and i hope you will aswell.","August 22, 2015","true","103.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although the game does usually follow the real-world timeline, what-if scenarios can occur at any time, such as Japan invading Siberia, or a communist revolution in France, or even... the fabled Axis victory. Being able to strategize is a MUST, in HOI3, giving minescule armies the ability to conquer a colossal military force. If handling the military isn't really your thing, you can delve straight into politics. From firing Stalin (and probably sending him to perish in Eastern Siberia), to giving the German people, the right to vote, and hate the Nazi party. The other main part of Hearts of Iron 3, is diplomacy. A neat chart, allows players to see where their nation is on the political spectrum, and which alliance (Allies, Axis, Comintern) they're drifting towards. And so much more. I highly recommend the third installation of the Hearts of Iron series, and would pay more than double the price for this legendary game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkest Hour is better though.","March 14, 2015","true","9.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The bottom line is the game is very complex, unfortunately although I took the time to learn the various mechanisms, what I found behind the complexity screen was very disapointing and a bit holow for a strategy game which such high claims. It is not a completely empty shell, but the ratio of complexity vs substance is really bad IMO. HoI2 had a better playability overall.\n\nA major issue is also technical bug and glitches, just check the forums. it is a pity that after several expansions, and many patchs, that the game is still unstable.\n\nThe game piles features upon features, but that didn't add up to make neither a interesting nor fun experience. From HoI 2 to HoI 3, each sub-systems increased in complexity, but this feels really gratuitous, as despite the complexity, the un-modded game is a poor political and historical simulation.. What the point in making such a complex game if the game so quickly move into fantasy land. in one game as the Germans, while I was dealing with Poland, Italy invaded France through the Alps in early 1939. In the end Italy reachedd Paris by the south in July 1939, at the same time I reached it from the north by the historical path. It so badly fails to reproduce the historical course of events, I won't give him any credits for portraying "alternative history"\n\n\nWorse for a WW2 game, the military operations are poorly implemented. Moving units is tedious, and combat feedback is very poor, you neither feel as a frontline commander, nor as a HQ staff officer planning operations. The idea of making a pseudo real time game (actually the game move in 1 hours increments), doesn't work so well with such a long and intense conflict. Micro managements is very high, but the tools and interface to give you orders are inferior to many 4X games.\n\nYou can delegate a number of functions to the AI, however the AI is just bad even for simple thing. In fact it doesn't work well because if you pursue a specific strategy the AI assistance won't go in the same direction as you. For example setting trade on AI automation, the AI sold critical ressources I was in short supply instead of buying them. Another exmaple setting part of my units under AI control, I had the surprise that he AI abandoned the French Frontier in 1940 to move to the Eastern front leaving the border vacant.\n\nThere is an important supply and command chain in the game: Division>Corps HQ>Army HQ>Army Group HQ>Theater HQ. However after a few days of battle your units can easily get messed aroundq the frontline as you react to enemy threats. Yet, tracking which units belong to which HQ is not easy as units and HQs are not color coded as in other games. Hence you spend hours unlinking and re-linking your units after every major operations. This is a real chore, and computer assistance is pathetic for such a mechanical task.\n\nThe game attempt to do too many things at once but the end result is a failure.","April 1, 2015","false","30.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've been playing computer games since Pong came out when I was a small child (showing my age here lol) and I've never come across a game that has so much depth and complexity.\nYet despite the complexity and high learning curve, once you are up and running it's relatively easy to play and more addictive than crack!\nThen there's the very active community who are constantly modding it in many different directions and with the Black Ice mod, it's almost a sequel in itself and one of the best mods I've ever seen!\nPure genuis and that's not too strong a description for this incredible game. If you have even the slightest interest in WW2, put the work in and learn to play this game. As far as I'm concerned, it's a work of art and I could go on and on with superlatives all day.\nIt will take over your life and educate you even if you are a scholar on this period of history.\nMy only criticism is they bottled it when it came to the Holocaust!\nIt covers virtually everything else that went on in this terrible conflict like dropping the atomic bomb and carpet bombing civilian areas. So not including any mention of the Holocaust can't have been on moral grounds or they wouldn't have any of the aforementioned included in the game!  But the Holocaust isn't even mentioned in one of the hundreds of game events that updates the game as the war in it progresses. It's like it never even happened which is pandering to the Holocaust deniers in my opinion, or modern day wannabe Nazis as they should really be known as, or apologists for murderer's of old men, women, children and the disabled! However, I believe a mod will come along that does have the courage to tackle the genocide and by this I mean ALL of the genocide carried out by Stalin (one example; out of the 90,000 german prisoners taken at Stalingrad, only 6,000 ever returned), the Japanese and the factions in Yugoslavia, etc, as well as the Nazi genocide.\nThis game could have been a fantastic way of educating future generations studying this conflict, but not if the genocide goes totally ignored!\nStill, this is a must play game for any serious computer gamer or WW2 buff.","July 17, 2012","true","166.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will be commanding troops, handling politics, and trying to keep your country alive.\n\n\nThere is no real way to "win" the game as the real victory comes from achieving goals that you set up for yourself. Maybe you want the United States to become a member of the Axis or maybe you want to take a minor power and transform it into a super power; the choice is yours.\n\nOf course there is "realism" mode where everything plays out as it did in real life.\n\n\nI highly recommend getting the DLCs "For the Motherland" and "Their Finest Hour" just be warned that you MUST have them in that order, just getting "Their Finest Hour" will not allow you to play the game. The learning curve is also very steep, but after a couple of games you will figure everything out and will still learn new things later on.\n\nHearts of iron 3 is a great RTS and it gets my seal of approval.\n\nA+\n","May 19, 2014","true","78.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Meh.\nAudio? Doesn't matter.\nGame play? Yes sirree, we have a winner.\nLike other paradox developed games, this is a Grand Strategy game on the Clausewitz Engine. It is set in world war II, and the leadup to that war. Build divisions of 2 to 5 Brigades, then organize those Divisions into corps, Armies, Army Groups, and Theaters. Carefully manage your production to keep dissent, supply, production, and upgrades in balance. Spy on your enemies, and keep yourself in power. This game is the micromanager's dream. The game is a real time strategy, but you can pause time to assess, rethink, and react. In fact, in a well set up game 80% lf the time you play will be spent paused, especially in the middle of a war, working out just how you'll move.\nDon't want to micromanage? Give the AI control and master the individual elements without having to worry about the others. This game is propped up as a decent game on Gameplay, and Gameplay alone. If you don't like the graphics, wait till HoI 4 comes out, and you might get better graphics. As is, I reccomend this game to any strategy nerd out there, those who liked EU3, and the other paradox game should also find this a fitting final game in the four game quartet.","December 22, 2013","true","50.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will be commanding troops, handling politics, and trying to keep your country alive.\n\n\nThere is no real way to "win" the game as the real victory comes from achieving goals that you set up for yourself. Maybe you want the United States to become a member of the Axis or maybe you want to take a minor power and transform it into a super power; the choice is yours.\n\nOf course there is "realism" mode where everything plays out as it did in real life.\n\n\nI highly recommend getting the DLCs "For the Motherland" and "Their Finest Hour" just be warned that you MUST have them in that order, just getting "Their Finest Hour" will not allow you to play the game. The learning curve is also very steep, but after a couple of games you will figure everything out and will still learn new things later on.\n\nHearts of iron 3 is a great RTS and it gets my seal of approval.\n\nA+\n","May 19, 2014","true","78.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you really want to develop an alternate history, you have to begin in 1936. The most difficult country to play as is Japan. The essential elements for success in this game are leadership and industrial capacity. Japan and France are both challenged in these areas. The easiest country to play is definitely the US. By begining in 1936, the US can concentrate on research and building industrial capacity BEFORE building units. To my mind, the worst mistake made by the Western powers was letting Republican Spain be conquered by the Fascists. If France, UK, and US had gauranteed Republican Spain's soverignty, they could never have been driven out of Europe in 1940. Worst case scenario, they could have retreated to Spain, and continued the war from there. Should the US joine the Allies early? No. Even if they have to support Spain alone, it is very important for the US to preserve it's freedom of action. In a game that I played as the US, Spain actually drifted to the Fascists BECAUSE the UK was bombing Spainish infrastructure. Defeat the Nationalists in Spain:yes. Destroy their country in the proxess:no.","July 5, 2014","true","681.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

For beginners this is an ideal entry to the series as you can have the AI control almost everything and you still get to influence what is happening and feel like a leader. For veterans like myself you can still micromanage as much as you want. The ability to build custom divisions adds another layer of depth. You get a special sense of satisfaction from moving your elite divisions to strategic points to break the enemy!\n\nLike most paradox games this one has its bugs. Most of them have been ironed out however this game often crashes on me.\nI found that weekly autosave and not using max speed during periods of intense warfare drasticly reduces that crash rate. Even after a crash starting from my last save is no big deal. This doesn't make me love this game any less, however the problem is still there.\n\nAll of the expansion packs are great and really deepen the experience. There is also an abundance of mods available that are easy to install.","December 3, 2013","true","939.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even though the game significantly shortens the play period to 12 years, it makes every second of it enjoyable.\n\nWith the rise of the Commitern, Facist, and Allied powers, you take on the role of any country present in the WW2 period, and must make the choice of either going to the aid of Great Birtain and France, the invading Eastern Europe by Germnay's side, or crossing the Volga in a counterattack with your Soviet allies.\n\nWhile it has the makings of great game, HOI 3 falls flat in some places. The shorter times span means that some situations repeat themselves, and the variety in playthrouhgs is diminished. Playing as a nation with a small military and population (i.e. Ireland) means you can't play a very active role in the war, and fighting the better armed and trained Axis or Allied forces would mean certain death.\n\n8/10, a great game with it's share of faults, but still great.","January 3, 2014","true","51.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I admired the fact that this apperaed to be nearest thing to actually commanding the conflict that one can ever hope to achieve, save for the people who actually fought in it. A very daunting, and perhaps even unfriendly game to beginners, it took me,  a realtively seasoned Strategy player of nearly all the Total War franchise, Company of Heroes and the even older Populous games, a very long time to figure out the games extraordinary complicity, and even today, I have only scratched the surface, after well over 200 hours of playtime. It is a flawed masterpiece however. The games AI, can be rather strange, commiting entire Heersgruppe's to deal with Norway, or in one instance, USA joining the Cominterm due to a pre-existing lend-lease treaty with Soviet Union. Also, those who have had their fill with singleplayer and dare venture forth to Multiplayer, will discover an ardous process of checking checksums, arranging private servers, and endless re-hosts,as Paradox did away with the Meta-server. However, Multiplayer can be very exciting and challenging, and even vetrans of singleplayer can be brought down by the novice in Multiplayer. Another great feature is mods, which deliver unparreled realism and depth, as well as hundreds of hours of playtime. To conclude, as I have said before, this is a flawed masterpiece, but certainly  a masterpiece of nontheless, doing something which, as far as I know, no other game franchise has done before, offering in depth realism of commanding any nation that existed between 1936-1948 in reagards to the Army(Airforce and Navy), Production, Diplomacy, Politics and Espionage. As well as that, it has thousands of real time generals, ministers, and commanders for each nation and party, even if you go a-historical, which is one of the games charms. A game that will never lose it's value or esteem.\n\nTL/DR\nBuy this game because Nazi nukes and Soviet cliches.

Some of those ideas may be more difficult than others, but regardless, after you understand this complex game, most of those ideas are possible to achieve.\nEuropa tries to model peace a bit too much, and thus there is less detail in war.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arocalex/recommended/25890/","arocalex","Arocalex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arocalex/","99 products in account","Before I start, you need to have several pieces of dlc for this game, the dlc's stack so you cant just get the last one and be done with it. So you need for the motherland, their finest hour etc. Each dlc adds a bunch of new stuff and balances the game out. Now the game itself is complicated, as in there are many small parts to the game that interconnect. There are many minute details that you can put your attention to if you want it. There is also automation available. The core of this game is a WW2 warsimulator and it does a decent job at that, the map is devided into many small provinces that you fight over. Look at some screenshots to see what I mean. So for instance france is devided into 300 or more seperate provinces you can fight over. It's a game of numbers. You can command every division individually and every air wing too. So you can have rommel roll into denmark with tanks or guardian control a bunch of infantry divisions. Neither of these options are ideal but you can do what you want and go about it how you want. That is what makes the game fun for me.","December 18, 2014","true","69.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It just didn't get counted through the fact, that I had to start this game manually via it's own .exe, as Steam forced it to crash.\n\n\nSomewhat complicated to get into, but totally worth it, once you understood everything.\nIt's the only game that really deserves to be called "global strategy".\n\nYou can play every nation during the begin of and throughout the Second World War. (And by that I really mean EVERY nation. It doesn't matter whether or not you want to play as Panama, Australia, USA, Germany, Argentina, France and so on and so forth. You can really play every nation.)\nAs stated before, however, it doesn't give you a tutorial of what to do. You have to figure all of that out by yourself. There are a lot of Tutorials or some Let's Plays online though, where you can see how the game is played.\n\nFrom politics, diplomacy and trading over research and espionage to strategic planning, fighting and maybe even couping a country, you can do everything. (Or you can decide to let one thing be controlled by an AI, where you can decide which policy it should follow, so that you can focus on the other things more efficiently.)\n\nIt's also quite open to modding and a lot of mods exist already. (You can also rather easily script your own events to make the game more historically accurate or to give it a complete alternative history twist.)\n\nI highly recommend it, as long as you are looking for a good strategy game that is really pushing you to the limits in terms of strategy. (Not in terms of mechanics though, as games like StarCraft2 are doing, for example. That simply wouldn't work out well in this game. It's not competetively oriented.)","December 26, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As I write I'm about 80.5 hours into this game and still learning things that would have been very beneficial hours ago. I keep discovering how much depth was put into this game the further I go, and it could not be much more enjoyable.\nThis is the ultimate strategy game, You will beed to be mindful of every front as well as the situations of your territories. If you try to build a massive army and rush a capitol like so many other strategy games you will regret it. Make sure you have the infrasructure and suplly lines first, (not to mention the technologies and useage of proper attacking srategies) and even then you may only be advancing at a "crawl".\nThis game takes into effect, moral, supply, terrain, weather/seasons, day/night cycles and so much more. It's combat system is well thought out and discorages rushers.\nAnd I'm only giving you the tip of the ice berg here.\nIf you take the time to learn how to properly play this game it will give you near endless hours of enjoyment. Especially if you appreciate micro-managing, historical acuracy, and complex gamplay.\n\nOne down side so far; constant crashes. But just set up your autosaves. Also for me the game kind of goes wierd before its going to crash. Usually the music stops or the display glitches, so i can save and restart.\nThis has become a good thing for me though, forcing me to take breaks.","November 26, 2014","true","161.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Where borders change and you look at it and wait for final result. This game is just like this.\n\nTimelapse symulator.\n\nWhy? Beacuse of the scale of the game. Main change beetwen this and hoi2 is core unit. In hoi2 it's division but here it is only brigade. So you don't command your armies but single divisions and beacuse of that map is shattered to tiny provinces. Poland for example - 200 provinces. You cannot command yourself at this level of complication but you need AI help. So you just give orders to hq command units to conquest some cities and the game play itself. For example 1944 campaign, when you start as soviet union you can't manege all hundreds kilometers of fight. You can't give orders to evry single division on this scale as it is absurd, so you let your hq do it for you and you choose berlin for target for example. And you do basically nothing as nothing is needed to win beacuse ai do it for you. Is this game or youtube video?\n\nOf course you can improve technology or diplomacy but for what? In hoi2 you made divisions and armies and you was the commander. For example as germany I made elite armies of 2 armored and 4 mechanised divisions, then I planed offensive and then I realised my plan commanding armies by myself. Here ai do it's for you and thats stupid. Even when you made a elite machanized division you still don't feel power of it as you should givie it to ai.\n\n-Also technology is unnecessarily complicated and not clear as in hoi2. If you compare this games, in previous one was in fact better system.\n\n-Diplomacy and espionage are better realised. Yeah, thats way better than annoying micromanagement in hoi2.\n\n-What's also annoying that important mechanics was cut out and added to expensive dlc.\n\n-naval combat is not great.\n\nSo in conclusion I can't reccomend this game to you as the game play itself. Better try hearts of iron 2 with addons or mods. Really.\n\n**I played it more than steam shows.

Of course...but you'll often have to lower your expectations far enough to avoid crushing disappointment.\n\nFunnily enough, the DLC they're selling is probably more broken than the game itself: two of them were rendered broken by the first expansion pack, and won't even start up, while the rest of it is replete with graphical errors[i.imgur.com]. Meanwhile, the expansions exacerbate an already horrendous memory leak, which will cause the game to cannibalise your RAM until it reaches the 32bit limit and crashes -- usually every 1 or 2 hours.","October 28, 2015","false","161.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","2"

Where borders change and you look at it and wait for final result. This game is just like this.\n\nTimelapse symulator.\n\nWhy? Beacuse of the scale of the game. Main change beetwen this and hoi2 is core unit. In hoi2 it's division but here it is only brigade. So you don't command your armies but single divisions and beacuse of that map is shattered to tiny provinces. Poland for example - 200 provinces. You cannot command yourself at this level of complication but you need AI help. So you just give orders to hq command units to conquest some cities and the game play itself. For example 1944 campaign, when you start as soviet union you can't manege all hundreds kilometers of fight. You can't give orders to evry single division on this scale as it is absurd, so you let your hq do it for you and you choose berlin for target for example. And you do basically nothing as nothing is needed to win beacuse ai do it for you. Is this game or youtube video?\n\nOf course you can improve technology or diplomacy but for what? In hoi2 you made divisions and armies and you was the commander. For example as germany I made elite armies of 2 armored and 4 mechanised divisions, then I planed offensive and then I realised my plan commanding armies by myself. Here ai do it's for you and thats stupid. Even when you made a elite machanized division you still don't feel power of it as you should givie it to ai.\n\n-Also technology is unnecessarily complicated and not clear as in hoi2. If you compare this games, in previous one was in fact better system.\n\n-Diplomacy and espionage are better realised. Yeah, thats way better than annoying micromanagement in hoi2.\n\n-What's also annoying that important mechanics was cut out and added to expensive dlc.\n\n-naval combat is not great.\n\nSo in conclusion I can't reccomend this game to you as the game play itself. Better try hearts of iron 2 with addons or mods. Really.\n\n**I played it more than steam shows.

That is, this is a World War II game.  If you enjoy WW2 lore and strategy games, this is not a bad game - the strengths of the game include technological advancements; the use of era-specific units; actual historical events that influence the overall experience (to make it more realistic in terms of both chronology and "what are you going to do about that?"); and hardy diplomatic and espionage systems.  There are also levels of customization in terms of unit names, province names, and other minor details.\n\nHearts of Iron III would be a totally awesome game if you could play it for much longer than just thirteen game years.  That is, the combat, economic, diplomatic, and province construction elements of the game are very, very cool.  But how cool can they be if you can't ever use them fully?\n\nThe biggest limitation, in my view (besides being limited to only thirteen game years), is that you MUST play as one of the great (or at least most significant) world powers of this era if you would like to do anything significant in this game.  If you simply want to develop, say, South Africa into an industrial or military or nuclear powerhouse - just to give the big boys a run - then you won't be able to do it (without significant modification to the game; you cannot accomplish this regularly).  The game is set up to historically accurate and plausible; so because a country like, say, South Africa never did anything so huge on a global scale, then you will not be able to make South Africa do anything globally significant in this game.  For those of us who like to play an underdog and build them up and alter world history, this game is not for us.  We are pigeonholed into the "realism" of the actual chronology and cannot do much to escape it.  So this limitation is probably ideal for WW2 enthusiasts, but it is certainly not ideal for us strategy gamers in general.\n\nFor me, the two limitations listed above are what kill the game for me.  I am not a WW2 buff, though I do appreciate the historical accuracy in terms of units, events, and other things.  Nevertheless, as a strategy gamer, Hearts of Iron III makes it essentially impossible to play the ways that I want to.  So that is why I do not recommend it.  I could only recommend this game to people who are thorough enthusiasts of the period and only if you bought the full, complete game for $6 or less.  That is, if you just want to buy "another WW2 game," then this one can give you some fun.  If you want to use the strategy elements of the game, then consider a different title from Paradox (like Europe Universalis III or IV or Crusader Kings II).  Even then, many of the strategic elements of Hearts of Iron III are not available in other Paradox titles except for other limited titles such as Victoria II.  Again, Paradox limits strategy players with period-specific games that do not allow for breaking from the mold and doing anything too free-form and significant (except when leading to a quick demise if you go too radical).\n\nJust as a side note, the Hearts of Iron series (all three titles) is entirely limited to the World War II era.  Hearts of Iron II, however, had an interesting expansion pack that enabled a time frame into the 1950s where the USSR provided a fictional threat to the USA (similar to the storyline of Indiana Jones IV with the pseudo-history of fictional Cold War events or possibilities).  Hearts of Iron III, however, will stop you at 1948 - either you played as one of the major Axis Powers and took over Europe, or you played as one of the Allied Powers and prevented that.  Period.\n\n--------\n\nI wanted to provide some more technical or more specific reasons for why I would not recommend Hearts of Iron III to the general strategy gamer.\n\n1)  Some technologies have twelve tiers to them.  That is, you will research one technology twelve times in order to cap it at Level 12/12.  Some technologies will require something like at least Level 3 of one technology in order to research a different technology.  This is really cool, of course.  However, you will find that unless you are either the United States or Germany, you will not be able to cap nearly any of these.  (As the USA or Germany, you might be able to cap just a few, even though there are several you'd probably like to.)  This is all fine if you just want to play a period-specific, relatively historically accurate game.  If you love strategy games in general, then this is a major let-down.\n\n2)  If you want to modify Hearts of Iron III, then you probably should be (or will get to be) familiar with tweaking certain values in the text file of your savegame.  However, unlike Europa Universalis III or IV, Hearts of Iron III is not so simple to figure out.  And once you do, you will notice that there is not much you can significantly do to change your lot in the game world besides cheating to full capacity.  In all, it is ridiculous how limited this game is if you simply appreciate its strategic elements and also don't give a crap about historical accuracy.  But, of course, if you are a WW2 nut and just want historical accuracy above all else, then modifying the game should not be important to you, as this game definitely limits itself to that period faithfully!","October 8, 2014","false","8.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The game has a RAM limit which caused frequent crashes until applying the 4gb patch. It also has an overly long load time even on an SSD\n\nMy biggest issue is with DLC and mods. The amount of DLC is absurd, most of which should be free like all the sprite and unit packs. In the full collection there are three games: original, For the Motherland, and Their Finest Hour. TFH is mandatory and is in effect the standard game and most mods are made for it. Mods are what could really make the game, but unfortunately I couldn't get any mod to work no matter what I tried. Others have the same issue\n\nIf you want to get into Hearts of Iron, I recommend trying Darkest Hour first. It's cheap and well supported with mods.

It has an amazing level of complexity and detail.  The sheer amount of information that you have to keep track of is a dream for strategy gamers who want something other then non-stop gore, violence, B movie acting and really bad story lines.\n\nHowever, I do not recommend this game and here is why:\n\n1) The combat system did not feel very fun\n--Too much like a board game\n--A little too quiet\n--Lacking visual flair\n\nGreat game and I highly recommend that you TRY it, but most people will probably find it a little too "hard core".

The Order of Battle (OOB) system. It is very intimidating, and it's not unusual for you to spend half an hour or more organizing your army.\n2. Poor UI. The UI for Hearts of Iron III is quite far from perfect, an example being there being a ton of mapmodes, with few even being useful, and a lack of shortcuts.\n3. Relatively railroaded gameplay. Bringing up my wargame point from earlier, Hearts of Iron III has few sandbox elements outside of your country, and becomes extremely predictable very quickly, following the order on how the war begins, and the same people joining the same teams every time without player influence.\n4. Terrible tutorial. The in-game "tutorial" is basically ignorable and a complete waste of time that teaches you very little about the game; you're better off just watching a few YouTube videos as a new player.\n\nWith it being an old game, there's also quite a few bugs. You will probably experience crashes, freezes, and other game-breaking bugs. On top of this, the AI is also very poor; once you develop basics for the game, you can basically just beat all of the AI.\n\nBecause of all of this, I do not recommend this game, since it's just too hard to get into, and requires you to devote long amounts of time into learning the game. However, if devoting a lot of time and doing military roleplay is more of your thing, then you might enjoy this game, provided you don't experience too many crashes.","May 30","false","72.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Despite most of the game being looking at a map, it offers in depth detail into being the government and military of a country with total countrol. Most players find peacetime the most boring time throughout the game, this can be worse if your playing a country like the United States which doesn't enter WW2 for quite sometime. However, people may find it boring during this peace / build phase but if its not thought out well you'll be quickly regretting and possbily restarting because you found that phase unimportant. If you are like me, and love to add flavor of events and hard decisions during peacetime especially and wartime I would highly recommend the Black ICE mod. This mod adds hundereds of historical events and decisions which have major to minimal impact on the game. These events can both be helpful and hurt you but I feel like it makes the games events harder as its not always a easy decision. For those reasons and the diversity of units and divisions that can be accomplished give you a more fun and tough time, as the AI also build more diverse and recieve events just for them to keep them up to par with you. If anyone ever has any questions or thoughts about getting or already has the game and just wants to discuss anything about it I encourage you to message me. As stated above I strongly recommend this game in its vanilla state or its various mods such as Black ICE, HPP and August Storm.","September 13, 2013","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Conquer the world as luxembourg, iceland rules the waves anything, well not exactly.'\n\nWhilst you have the freedom to be any country and do anything this game is as much a simulation as strategy. Maybe Belgium wants to invade Denmark but first you will need industry, good technology and an army. The rest of the world is not going to sit there either so be prepared from attack by Italy. This is what make it so addictive, you can see how  the war would have gone if you were in command of Germany and Diddn't attack Russia. Maybe you become communist whatever really...\n\nSo in a nut shell its great.

I'm a former Starcraft Player, and while not competitive, Ive had a history with strategy games.\n\nIn comparison to strategy games I've played (Civ5, Age of Empires, SC2), Hearts Of Iron blows it out the water. This strategy game isn't for the casual and faint of heart however, since it is slow at the beginning and has a steep learning curve, hell I can hardly play the game without AI. The game's tutorial isn't much help, especially because I hate reading. I hope a new video/visual/interactive tutorial will be in IV to help new players and casuals like myself. I found the game extremely challenging, which in my case is a good thing, I liked the steep learning curve and time taken to actually be able to play. It makes the game play a lot more satisfying and interesting to play.\n\nOverall this game is a 7/10, if it wasn't impossible to learn and had a better in game tutorial.","May 18","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

So you don't know what to do.  And I don't mean you're confused by some aspects of the game.  I mean you do not know how to interact with the game or accomplish anything.\n\nHere was my experience.  I loaded the game, and it gave me a choice of a few games to play through.  I chose the easiest one that was suggested by the game as the easiest one, for beginners.  So I clicked on that one.\n\nThe game loads in.  I am looking at a map of Europe.  There are chits all over the map.  I can click on the chits and they make noises.  I don't know what the chits represent or how to interact with them.  I click on everything, push all the buttons on my keyboard, and can't do anything but make noises when I click on chits.\n\nI thought it was a bug, so I quit and restarted.  Same thing.  I looked for a how-to-play or a manual or anything.  Nope.  I guess this is a game made for people that already knew how to play Hearts of Iron 1 or 2?\n\nSo the game is just looking at a map you can't interact with.\n\n‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this game in every orifice with a lava ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ridiculous ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.\n\nLook, it says I've played it for 1.1 hours.

A graphical update from Hearts of Iron II, Oil needs to be converted to Fuel, diplomacy affects trade, and automation out the wazoo.\n\nThe biggest change that this automation brings around is your theatres. You create a hierarchy of troops, and can give each part of the hierarchy a goal to accomplish, and the AI goes about doing it. The AI isn't too bad at this, but if you feel like you could do better, you can still manually select and control any divisions. My biggest problem with this system is how damn clunky it is to create the hierarchy. It could really use its own window to manage or something because individually selecting EACH AND EVERY DIVISION is ridiculous. However, once you have spent half your day organizing your armies, its pretty fun to manage. It makes it feel a lot more like you are a general of some form, assigning officers and giving them generic orders, and letting them do the micromanagement. But because its not required, you can still take care of any details you want and just let the AI deal with the rest.\n\n\nOverall, I would definitely reccomend this game to someone who is interested in hearts of iron in general, and especially if you liked Hearts of Iron 2.

In anticipation of the release of HoI IV I went back to play this. It does not run well on modern systems. It frequently crashes when alt-tabbing it has no support for Full Screen windowed, the windowed mode does not perform well and the mouse cursor is shifted a few pixels vertically.\n\nIf you play the game in full screen, never alt tab and try your best to keep it from crashing it still becomes unstable late game or if you have a lot of units. It's unfortunate since it's such an amazing classic. If you want to play Hearts of Iron I recommend waiting for the forth game to be released as that runs on a newer engine.","June 3","false","30.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Having first bought the game, I thought GREAT! unlike all the Zionist publishers out there, we can have a bit of historical realism instead of a politically correct re-write of history. But then the complexity! Oh the horror. If you are some sort of grand master savant of RTS then this is the game for you. If you use your brain for work & switch it off for leisure, stay away, it will mess you up.\n\nThe constant crashing may have more to do with those imbeciles at Microsoft who get away with figurative commercial murder on a daily basis. Screw North Korea, it's Seatle you need to worry about!\n\nUnbelievable complex & difficult to play for a relative novice (been gaming over 30 years!) such as me. When you do reload after a crash, you find there is data corruption on the save, such as wiping out a nations units or forgeting the power block status. As I say, I do not necessarily blame Paradox, Microsoft has a well proven record of unreliability, and get away with this because of the state endorsed attitude towards their total monopoly.\n\nIf you love it, I can see your point of view, go ahead you genius! If you like a dip your toes in, switch your brain off and enjoy a leisurely world conquest, look for entertainment elsewhere.\n\nPS.

Starting the game loads forever, it even says "this could take several minutes".\n\nAll the fighting is done by the AI and all the player gets to do is the endless tedium of a staff officer work, assigning this HQ to that HQ, assigning the brigades to the division and then the AI takes the fun part of combat. You can take manual control but due to the moronicly high number of provinces and units you can't do it right and certainly not on an entire theatre.\n\nThere is zero sandbox value that I loved so much from HOI2. You start the 1939 scenario already at war, there's no way to build a different army or take a different political decision. Worst of all there are silly historic events that take place no matter what you do: e.g. if you wage war in Poland (or the AI does it for you) you get swamped by messages about some lame battle between 2-3 destoryers somewhere in the Atlantic. How did they get there and why would you care about the minor stuff? I don't.\n\nOverall it's the experience of watching the grass grow. You can automate everything, but the game looks ugly as hell and there's a feeling that you can't do a thing.

But all along, in the back of my head, the tiny voice of rationality kept telling me that there really is nothing else to add to the Hearts of Iron II series.\n\nRegardless, I pre-purchased the steam version a week before the release. I left work earlier and even skipped college just to get the first glimpse of this grand strategy - instead I got a stinking pile of $hit.\n\nLoading times, with my Quadcore 3Ghz was insanely long.\n\nGameplay:\n\nUnplayable. Instead of the fast way to link or separate divisions by the easy use of a "SHIFT" button, we get a whole other display of the selected army on the upper left side of the screen. And for each division, we have a cute button all the way at the end that says "SELECT". Which means that we cant highlight divisions anymore, we have to "SELECT" each one of them. My favorite scenarion of all time was, of course, Gotterdamerung 44, playing as Germany. Now, with the HOI II series, it took me around 20 minutes at most to set up the right leadership, divison production, etc. With this game, it took me an hour, and not because I didn't know how to manage the game, but because of the tedious ways in which the game works. The leader icons are miniscule, you can barely see other icons indiciation either the ESP, or even ORGANISATION level. I mean seeing your organisation level is one of the most important things\n\nBugs:\n\nQuite often, you aren't able to select leaders for your armies, instead you might end up leading a leaderless army. Second, why in the world would we need a whole separate window for the Army leaders? what was wrong with the easy accessible leader-board on the left side of the screen? and what's with all down-grading generals? We can actually downgrade 5 star generals to 2 star generals? why is that an option? that makes promoting leaders just a silly joke. Promotion should involve long-term investment into the leader if you want him to lead either a 6 or 12 divison army. There might be more bugs in the game, I only played it for around 4 hours\n\nProduction and Technology:\n\nThe tech tree is $hit, plain and simple. Upgrading your infantry division with a couple dozen tiny upgrades, like better river crossing, better land fortification assaults, better mortar fire, etc over the YEARS is tedius and unmemorable. We all know that feeling when we get "infantry divison 1941 developed" or "Medium tank 1941" developed, instead of a max of 5 techs that we used to develop, we can now develop up to 20 mini techs. Do we really need "mountain equipment", "desert equipment", "jungle equipment" etc? or can we just get a nice 1941 division and add just ONE brigade to characterize the division's mission? And what's with these damn brigades comprising divisons? We all know that a panzer divison doesn't just consist of tanks, but of hundreds of trucks and thousands of personel and infantry. So why, would we need to customize our divisions by adding either extra artillery brigades, motorized brigades, etc? That just gives us more options which are confusing and time consuming.\n\nAnd I guess the ships are upgradable now. May I ask why? Dont we all remember playing as Japan and bracing for that "Carrier 1941" tech to deveop in order to start catching up with the US while we prepare for Pearl Harbor?\n\nThe MAP:\n\n12000 provinces...really? why do we need thousands of provinces in South America? or Africa? or endless Siberia? Is anyone actually going to wage war there? wouldn't it be better if they just added more provinces in all the theaters of WW II? Since that what the game is about? Some people complained about the scrolling speed, I personally cannot complain because my PC can take this game easily. However, I thought the 3d water effects were pretty useless. And why don't we see armies sort of exchanging fire with one another like in HOI II?\n\nThe good:\n\nFinally, they have introduced this following feature - casualty list. After each battle, you will get the amount of casualties on both sides. And I gotta admit, its pretty effective, it makes you want to immidiately research tech on reducing attrition, improving medical equipment etc. And so far, that feature is the ONLY one I enjoyed having while playing the game. If they could put that in HOI II, I would play it even more.\n\nThere are definitley more things to say about this game. And I would be glad if more people tried enjoying this game. I tried desperate to enjoy it. I didn't want to spoil it for those who already bought it, but for those who are undecided, just think a little more before buying the game.","November 27, 2013","false","23.0"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","10","30","0","0"

There are even new Music tracks exclusive only on some DLC's!\n\nSince I hate to have those "paywalls" to be able to get the entire game's experience, I would definitely not recommend it. Maybe "Hearts of Iron IV" will be more complete at its release at the start of 2015.

The long waits at reducing neutrality to zero in order to attack anyone is horribly thoughtout, and the fact that a cheat was built in to reduce your neutrality to 0 kind of makes me wonder what the devs were thinking. The diplomacy section is useless beyond belief. I attack Brazil (Axis) as Canada (Neutral) which sparks war with the USA (Allies) because for some unknown reason Axis and Allies don't automatically go to war. Who do I negotiate peace with in this weird situation? Not the US or Brazil...that would make the most sense...but Germany, the country I never attacked at all. I guess the glorious Fuhrer managed to pull a Cobra Commander and replace FDR. A+ for the weird alliance system that caues this to make abolutely no sense.\n\nI was interested in this game solely because it allowed people to play as some other country other than the top dogs in WW2, and for that I give two thumbs up. But to have broken systems where said countries can do absolutely nothing in the game of any importance, and when they pull off a miracle and somehow do (taking GuanZhou from the enemy) said minnow has to give all the glory aka resources to the top dog because the UK is the Allied leader and they get all the territory.\n\nIf you want to be the top dogs, pick a different game.

He got it for me so that we could play multiplayer together.  Unfortunatly we never got it to work because he owned a piece of DLC that I didn't.  But that's not why I'm not recommending this game, that's just a warning for those who plan on getting it to play multiplayer.  The reason is because this game is VERY difficult to learn.  The previous Paradox games I've played were very fun and somewhat user-friendly, so I was surprised that I couldn't say the same about this one.  It does come with a tutorial, however it is VERY long, and for some reason they tried to encorporate a small story into it making it much longer than neccessary, and honestly very off-putting and more boring than your average tutorial.  I enjoy a good story, but it's surprisingly difficult to pay attention to when you're also trying to memorize what all the complex options under the technology menu. Speaking of menus, this game has menus.  Lots and lots of menus.  Granted, it is organized very nicely, but it's still a lot to take in.  It takes some getting used to, but if you're dedicated enough you can learn it.  In fact, I think that applies to the entire game in general.  It's quite difficult to learn and even harder to master. While I know a lot of "grand strategy game" fans will love it, I would NOT recommend this game to the average player.  However, if you've got a lot of time and you're looking for a complex strategy game, you might love it.","December 16, 2013","false","4.4"," 2 of 19 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","19","0","0"

This game is complex as hell and will likely overwhelm you right at the start. This game is also poorly designed from a UI standpoint and has far too many screens for management.\nHOWEVER, the plus points of this game are: complex strategy, well thought-out balance and historicity, a solid combat and diplomatic system, and unbelievable replayability. By the time of this review, I have put 61 hours into the game, which I chose to start on the 1936 setting. I am now in 1939. Yeah. Add to this that the decisions I made completely changed how the war started and who's on which side, you can see where I'm going with this.\n\nThis game allows you to be Hitler. Or Stalin. Hell, you can even play as Luxembourg. Choose a country, build your armies (or not, but I would not recommend this choice), choose a side (or not) and play out this game. You can manage espionage, warfare, diplomacy, internal economics, trade, politics and technology (or you know, just put it on auto-manage).\n\nBest Grand-Strategy I've played, even with its flaws.\n\n9/10","November 11, 2014","true","190.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a sucker for damn near anything WW2. So anyhow, I got this game for super cheap, so I wasn't too worried about if it was going to be a bust or not. Suffice to say, 8 hours later, I'm hooked. Which is somewhat strange, considering this game is easily one of the most complex I've ever played. Imagine if Axis & Allies got together with Civ 2's WW2 scenario, consumed a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ton of LSD, then made it so you can control not only the units, but production, tech research, diplomacy, internal politics, and more, then made it all super crazy complex, but only added in vague tutorials that somewhat give you an idea of what to do, but actually somehow manage to leave you even MORE confused, and you're also addicted to it like it was LSD from the get go. I feel like I understand maybe 30% of the game so far, and even the stuff I do get I'm still kind of sketchy on.","December 27, 2014","true","028.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
