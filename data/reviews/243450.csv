"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/243450/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Urban Trial Freestyle feels like a cheaper version of Trials. It's alright though. And it controls pretty much the same as the Trials games. Unfortunately, the graphics are so-so but there's much more going on in the levels animation-wise. At times it's a bit distracting and sometimes it can be hard to see what you have to do or where you have to go, but it at least made the world feel alive, even if it's an arcade racer.\n\nThe races/levels can be hard, and earning stars halfway through the game can be frustrating, especially if you want to unlock the next batch of levels.\n\nThe levels are generally pretty short, however, so I can't see anyone ragequiting over them. But it's a time consuming task.\n\nLike Trials, you can also change your character's clothing and upgrade his motorcycle. You can do this with money. Money is scattered across the levels and collecting it will allow you to do this. Some of it is hidden in plain sight, other bags are located in less obvious places. Finishing a level doesn't always result in you getting money so that was what I meant when I was talking about the frustration part earlier. Upgrading your motorcycle can help you improve your score(s).\n\nIn the end UFT is a good game, but just not good enough. Pay a few [currency] more and buy Trials instead. And buy this in a sale later on.\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","September 22, 2013","true","2.9"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","0"

This type of games have been very popular on Flash game sites since forever.\n\nReally nice graphics for this type of game, the developers have done a marvelous job.\n\nIt is essentially a 2D game in a 3D world. You see your motocross bike from the side, basic controls to accelerate, decelerate and control your pitch (lean forwards/back).\n\nThe goal is to drive through the course as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and performing certain tasks. Each level have a set of objectives where you get tested such as; "Precise Aim" where you need to jump as close at a target as possible, "Highest Jump" where you jump as high as possible, etc.\nYour records are uploaded and you can compare to other players online.\n\nOn the levels there's moneybags, if you collect these you can buy new parts for your motocross bike and costumes for your character.\n\nThere are 5 different "worlds" with ~8 levels on each, some levels seem to be reused or atleast portions of them are, but this is fine, they offer different challenges in the objectives instead.\n\nOnce you've started making your way through the main levels, a series of challenges start to unlock which are wildly different from the main game. I strongly encourage you to try the challenge levels!\n\nI think it could be a fun element if they added tricks to it, for bonus points. There are a few places where you need to do flips to get bonus points, however I would imagine something more freely. Perhaps that goes into a different genre of motocross games tho.\n\nI can't really tell if the music is good or not, it's just ambiance.

A decent indie attempt at that type of game but nowhere near as good as the triple a version. The motorcycle never feels "fast" and the sound is more annoying than authentic. Graphics aren't impressive but there are some pretty cool environments. That being said it is sometimes hard to distinguish what is in the foreground and what is in the background. Also some of the jumps and stunts that the game makes you aren't that good and feel awkward. For some reason this game's levels are gated with a mobile game like star unlock system where you must do well on the previous levels to move on. This meant that I couldn't progress after failing to beat one particular level with some pretty bad design. There is only 1 bike with upgrades and some player skins with no actual impact on gameplay.\n\nThat being said, I did have fun.

Sometimes it would crash once and then play fine for an indefinite amount of time. Other times it would crash at random over and over again and I just had to give up that day. Not fun.\n\nIt also crashed every single time I got a Steam card for the game while playing.\n\nI feel like the graphics engine wasn't optimized very well as I had to lower shadow settings and turn off AA. I have a GeForce GTX295. For the level of graphics in this game... it shouldn't be struggling at the max settings. I was able to get a constant 60FPS by lowering the shadow detail and turning off AA but i had to run it in 1920x1080.\n\nSpeaking of resolution. I have two 1440p monitors and i seemed to get slightly better stability when i set my resolution to match what I’d launch the game at.\n\nIt took me 10 hours to beat all the tracks, get all the cash bags and beat all the challenges.\n\nPros\n-Nice looking graphics\n-Good physics\n-Entertaining levels\n\nCons\n-Poorly optimized\n-Random/Constant crashes\n-Listening to the same, UNSKIPPABLE intro every time you start the game\n\nIf you get this on sale for a dollar or two, it'll give you a bit of entertainment for your money. Anything higher than that I can't recommend due to stability/performance issues.","July 21, 2014","false","9.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Most of the negative reviews I read focused on the game being a Trials clone, which wouldn't offend me in the least.  In fact, I found it to be more reminiscent of Trackmania.  The real issue is that the bike physics are garbage, the courses aren't well designed, doing well doesn't feel rewarding, and the player's character is a dope.  I'd also ding it for having your character start off naked instead of having at least basic protective gear - having to win races before you can wear a helmet is nonsensical, like so much else in this game.","February 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I did really enjoy it.\n\nOkay, so where to start? Basically, I'm not quite a fan of any extreme sports games, well I am, but I don't play them too much. My last game was Gravity Defied I guess .-.\nSo, this game pretty much delivers. I didn't expect it to be any good, but that game just dropped my expectations to tha ground.\nFirst of all, graphics is pretty decent. I did enjoy all these dystopian pictures that the developers showed in the game, classically, about the police, fire everywhere and some kind of nuclear war o3o, especially in the last part\nThe gameplay itself is pretty nicely done, physics is decent, and it's quite easy to play, since you need only 4 keys and within an hour you're gonna be pro at this game, of course of you aren't a lobster.\nChallenge in this game is pretty fun, getting points, and stuff. The easiest way to win is for sure time challenge, that I've won several times there lel. It's not too much of popular games these days so you do have a chance to get on top of board even not being pro at extreme sports games.\nThe Challenge Mode isn't really too interesting...worth playing once or twice though.\nBut I'll be sure to play story mode again and again to get mroe stars and earn more records\n\nSo, all in all, this is not yet perfect game, but rather decent, sometimes it's ♥♥♥♥ed up and you just don't understand how to do some sh*t at some points, but it really delivers, so\n8.8/10\n\nRecommended for fans.","March 8, 2014","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The main complaints where that the game 'is a copy of Trials HD' which I think is ridiculous because all games copy of each other some how, this game still brought in the timed level and skill level which are great to try and get up the leaderboard and it has it's own maps, they aren't copied so you can just think of it as a map pack instead of raging about a game you haven't played. I have a major issue though, It's too easy, I’ve never completed a game on the first day I’ve had it since guitar hero. I got all the achievements and so there was nothing left for me to do but it is a good game and I do suggest that you try it out. The controls are easy to get used to (This includes Xbox controller and mouse/keyboard). It is a short game overall and it won't take you long to work your way through them but it would be better if they made an expansion pack or they make a new game that is a hell of a lot longer. It would make it better if they copied a map creator that is another thing that people brought up because once you complete the game then you have nothing to do, It has done nothing for me, I had fun at the time but now what?

I started playing it without any expectations, and really enjoyed it. It can be completed in four or five hours, but collecting all the money, getting 5 stars on all missions, and beating your friends' scores can keep you playing for longer.\n\nThe graphics are good, and the 2.5D design works well with the dynamically changing levels. Each level responds as you drive through it, usually with police getting in your way or structures collapsing to form ramps. The one level design element that I found annoying is the jumping platforms, which are introduced later in the game, and seem to be designed to kill the rider repeatedly rather than propel him to new areas.\n\nThere are four tracks in each of the five worlds, and also two brief tutorials and five challenges (each of which has its own rules and its own track). Each track also has two modes, race and stunt, which are unlocked separately.\n\nIn race mode, you'll race against the fastest ghost of whichever leaderboard you have selected: global, friends, or self. I felt that global was out of my league, but I had a lot of fun trying to beat my friends' fastest records.\n\nThe stunts consist of long jumps, high jumps, precision jumps, and speed checks at certain parts of each track. The rider will do tricks during many of the stunts, but these are purely cosmetic and happen automatically. You can instantly return to the previous checkpoint with no direct penalty, which is great for trying to beat your friends' high scores in stunt mode.\n\nEach track has $5000 in bags of $500, $1000, or $2000 hidden along it. This money can be used to buy functional upgrades for your bike or cosmetic upgrades for your rider. There aren't many customization options, so I found the bike upgrades and rider appearance system lacking.\n\nThe bike's engine noise gets repetitive quickly, but you can turn the sound down in the options menu. The soundtrack is decent, but nothing outstanding.","March 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/243450/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","I wasn't all that inspired initially with the gameplay of Urban Trial Freestyle. The overall motorcycle control certainly feels a little shallow and the game does its best to focus your attention on environmental animations to hide that lack of gameplay. I mean you essentially accelerate, brake, and lean forward or backward on your motorcycle--and that's it.\n\nThe courses are short and there are time trials where you race against a ghost rider as well as stunt trials where you score points to achieve stars which unlock more levels. There are moneybags placed throughout the levels which after collected can be used to purchase bike upgrades or clothing. The game can be a little frustrating since some of the moneybags are located in areas that require bike upgrades so there can be a sense of having to backtrack to an earlier track to get the remaining moneybags after you acquire enough money to purchase the necessary upgrades.\n\nAfter giving the game a bit more play time, I do find it to be somewhat fun and enjoyable. The challenge courses are interesting. And getting maximum stars isn't all that easy so there is some challenge to the game as well. Overall, it's a game I would play again, albeit in moderation.","October 3, 2014","true","3.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The challenges offer more replayability, and they can be very difficult.  For a good price, when on sale, this is a great game to pick up.

I played the heck out of those free 2d bike trial browser games. And I expected the gameplay to be similar, and I wasn't wrong. But despite the graphics and fireworks, Urban Trial Freestyle manages to be more simpel and to dumb down the 2d free browser games.\n\nOne of the main problems, imho, are the levels. They are too simple, too short, too unchallenging. Yes the random challenges are cool (highest jump, longest jump, whatever), but truth still is that you spend most of the (very short) level pressing accelerator and watching the fireworks.\n\nBut the main problem for me was: It gave me massive motion sickness. I've made sure to have 60hz stable, vsync, I've played with other settings, no joy. I'm not sure if it's the 2.5d concept or if it's something else in the graphics or optimization but the bottom line is... I just can't play it.

This game is an unabashed knock-off of Trials, the much heralded game which is literally the exact same thing. You're a motorbike rider trying to get through an obstacle course where the handling and physics of the bike are the crux to passing them. I look at this game as a cover version of a popular song. Rarely are cover versions better than the original, but once in a while an artist will do very well and have a hit of their own on their hands. This is not a hit, but it's at the very least curiously listenable.\n\nThere is not a lot of customization in this game. There is basically one bike that you upgrade various parts of using money you collect on the various tracks.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n- I liked the background effects of the tracks. The NPCs include cops, various passersby, and occasionally people will try to throw things at you. There's even some explosions.\n\n- It was $0.99 and it drops cards.\n\n- Relatively small (about 800 mb) download.\n\n- Its challenging.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\n- It lacks depth. The tracks are repeated at the higher levels in places.\n\n- Occasionally the bike handling/physics is wonky.\n\n- The braking and reverse mechanic has to be used sometimes to get awkwardly placed money bags and can totally kill your time/momentum.\n\nYou can do a lot worse than spending a buck on this game. It's an unapologetic knock-off of the brilliant Trials series (the latest game in that series is Trials: Fusion) and it succeeds in replicating the gameplay of that series to a point. However, at the end of the day, why play this when I can just play Trials? It does nothing that series does better.\n\nThat being said, it's a buck, and with four card drops, you basically can get this game for $0.40 if you choose to sell those drops, even less if you get a foil.\n\nDon't expect anything great, but if you know what you're getting into, there's a bit of entertainment to be found with this game.\n\nIf you do find that you like this game, or at the at the very least how it plays, do yourself a favor and pick up one of the entries in the Trials series.","June 25, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's certenly draws inspiration from Trials, some may say it's copying it and so what? It's good game.\n\nThe game is console port and a great one. I even try playing with the keyboard. It's fine, but the prefered method is a controller. And with him playing is great. If you make mistake, it's entirly your fault.\n\nThe game have limited video options – resolution, V-sync, Shadow quality and AA. The game is definitely not ugly, it just good, but not great. But so many things happen on screen and you won't notice textures or other things. You will be concentrated over the gameplay mostly. The game may not be the prettiest, but it have so many details on background and foreground. You see lake, big skyscrapers and so on.\n\nUrban Trial Freestyle is side-scroller racing game with a bike. You hate to get from point A to point B, avoiding tons of obstacles. That's it. The level design is great. You will ride through forest, slums, highway with a lot of crashed cars, on top of buildings, high in the sky, on a train, in a train depot, on a dam, through an office and so on. There are some level that feel like you are in a hollywood movie. Police is chasing you, explosions everywhere, highspeed and dangerous jumps. It's like Michael Bay was directing. The thing what I like a lot here is this – there is always something going on on the foreground and background. Worker doing his thing, exploding helicopter, even a train crash. They may distract you, so bear that in mind. Sometimes those events may cause an obsticale to apper or the ground to rise. What i'm trying to tell you is the developer put a lot of thoughts in the level design.\n\nWhen you finish a track you will be rated with stars and money. Sometimes only when you get 5 you will get cash. For unlocking new tracks you have to gather certain number of stars. Here there are two type of races – time attack and tricks. Tricks are more interesting. You don't race with a clock, although when you finish the race, the remaining time will count as points. Here you have to do highest jump, precise aim, highest speed or rotating the bike. Bigger the achievment, more points you'll get. There is  a green line to show you record for that track, so there is replay value.\n\nYou have only one bike, but you can buy upgrades for him. They are pretty straight foreward and all have pluses and minuses. Buy a bigger engine, handling will decrease and so on. You can dress the biker, but i'm not in to this kind of thing.\n\nAs far as the sound design, there isn't much to say. The effects are like exploisions, sirens, collapsing road, crashing or crumbling are okay, but I don't like engines. They are weak.\n\nMusic is okay. Sometimes it's jazzy, other fast and electronic, but overall you may not notice it that much in the middle of this chaos. I think I won't listening it outside of the game.\n\nWhen you're done with the main game you can tackle the Challenges. I like the a lot. They are total of 5 and you have to do different things from the main game. Shoot the biker as far as you can, drive as far as possible with limited fuel, platforming with the bike to collect signs for points and my favourite – the track where you can change gravity. There have to be more tracks like this.\n\nThe biggest sin here is the lacking of level editor. This is essential for the longevity of the game. It's such a shame. Other small problem is the weird 40-50 fps I get without recording. I have mid-range machine and I think should get more fps. I'm not sure if the problem is on my side or it's the games optimizations. But the fps stay mostly about 50 and they rarely go under 40.\n\nAs a whole the game is great. I haven't played Trials and I can't compare them. I supose RedLynx games is superior, but this game is worth playing. If you don't want to deal with Uplay or Trials is pricey for you, jump on here. It took me around 7 h to beat it and here you have enough replay value. If solid controls, good graphics, great level design, and extra challenges sounds good to you, buy it. I definitely recommend it.","October 21, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Seriously though about everything we ever wanted in the NES excitebike game minus the 3 other racers that wouldn't really make sense for this title. Get it on sale though because the lack of need to balance the bike with the right toggle stick that you might expect of freestyle type games gives it a beyond gravity one dimensional feel at times. Still very interesting if your looking to add a little something different to your collection, or to make funny videos down the road. Also as every DMV should have this game as part of their motorcycle trainging manual guide because so many of the hazards could occur in real world situations.

Even when you're done with it you're still likely to want to have a play once in a while.\n\nThere's wheel, chassis, engine upgrades, which obviously make the bike lighter, faster etc; but also change the handling of the bike. The controls are simple enough to jump straight into yet the maps & physics require mastery.\n\nIf you beat your friends at any challenge your pic goes up on the in-game billboards so they all see it as they ride-by & fail. ;)\n\nI can't say whether it is better or worse than others in the series, but on it's own I can't find anything to complain about.\n\nIt's worth the price & if on sale it's a no-brainer.","November 9, 2014","true","18.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

It starts as a simple 'bike balance' flash game, but sadly manages to mess up what hundreds of flash games seem to pull off.\n\nThe backgrounds are too busy to say the least, Barely a level goes by without a helicopter crash, a tanker explosion or some part of Michael Bay's wet dreams. With all this going on, focusing on you non-descript rider (who looks like Techno Viking straight out of the box) becomes challenging.\n\nThe graphics themselves are massively dated, and wouldn't look out of place on a PS2 or original Xbox, which make the aforementioned backgrounds even more of an eyesore.\n\nThen theres the sounds, with the bike sounding like an irritated wasp in a tin can, the tin-like explosion, and the 4 soundbites of 'cops' (which are purely backdrops, serving no actual threat to the player) shouting 'freeze' or 'hey you'.\n\nAll in all, if you want to play a balance game, find a flash game.

This game offer just like 6 different stages that don't seem to get any harder so there's not really a learning curve which is quite disappointing froma  game that wants to compete with Trials, its just getting from point a to b\n\nIts incredibly easy and doesn't explain the objectives very well which are scattered around in certain levels. It hides moneybags around the level to improve your bike, because thats a great system find the collectibles so you can accomplish the objectives to a higher degree. The level design isn't fantastic either where some obstacles don't properly align with others.\n\nThere's alot going on in the background but when you're trying to focus on what your bikes doing the background action can a little jarring and distracting. Graphically its pretty much the same as Trials. Really the only benefit is at least you don't have to use Uplay but this is such a mediocre game, get Trials really get Trials its not a very good port but its still better than this.","February 20, 2014","false","2.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

This game is, if you hadn't already made the connection yourself, a poor mans Trials, which is why I felt comfortable reviwing this with so little play time. If you've played any Trials game, you've essentially played this.\n\nIt's hard to really mention this game in it's own light without bringing up Trials, as Urban Trial really does nothing to differentiate itself from the game it so clearly apes. The main problem with UBF though, is that it doesn't do anything better than Trials, in fact it does everything worse. The bike controls are vastly inferior, with there being no subtletly in handling and balancing, and you will actually find it very hard to overbalance or even fall off your bike. The track designs are very simple, and repetitive, and do little to challenge anyone coming in from Trials, and I doubt they would even challenge anyone new to the games.\n\nOut of the first two worlds which I completed, (in 45 minutes of play, with there being 5 worlds overall), there were a lot of repeated tracks, which points to this games brevity. Yes, you can go back and replay levels, trying to beat your scores, or 5 star every track, but there is little incentive to do so, when the levels are barely that fun on the first play. There are also 5 challenge modes to unlock, again apeing Trials, but they are very short and not all that interesting.\n\nI state all this but I am still leaving this game a positive review, why? Firstly, no Uplay. Secondly, for the price I picked the game up, I can't say I am too disappointed. The game is cheap, and is very often on sale. At best it's a decent Trials knock off, at worst, a bit boring, definitetly not terrible. If you've played all the Trials games and are looking for more filler, this is worth a shout.","October 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

I was totally surprised though and had so much fun with it. It's pretty simple with you as a biker trying to complete certain course in set times or getting a certain score which helps you unlock the next track, you get the idea. But it brought me back to old school games where you just want to get that next part unlocked and you keep trying and banging your head against the keyboard etc on certain bits.

But in this game alot of the time u gotta make the right choices straight from the beginning of the level or your whole run is going to be bad. there has also been many times were i die on an obstacle over and over and when i finally get passed said obstacle i don't even know how i did it most of the time. Or if u buy one or two things in the store that you werent supposed to ur not going to be able to afford the biggest engine. and if u don't have the biggest engine u dont have a chance at beating this game. becausealmost all of the challenges depend on speed. thers straight up speed tests, highest jump tests and flip test and u need speed for all of them. and the worst part is if u made a few bad investments at the start of the game getting money will be very difficult later on because you will need speed to even reach the money bags to unlock more parts. i give it 4/10 atleast it did'nt cost much...","July 30, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it is very much like it with a few changes. But these changes, in my opinion, are bad. In some tracks you are supposed to go for points by doing things like getting the highest jump. It changes things up which is nice. You do the next track and it's either getting points or a time trial. Then after that, you repeat the previous track doing a time trial this time. It's like the developers think you're three years old and can't notice you're playing the same track twice.\n\nYou would expect the bike to control well. But it doesn't it's very hard to turn correctly. You can upgrade your bike but that just makes it even worse. Some obstacles in the game are incredibly hard to pass. Some of the obstacles hardly ever work. And sometimes a car that it supposed to stop in a certain spot wont stop there making you fall. Or a car will stop in the middle of the road when it's not supposed to. This is completely random and you have no way to control it. The hard obstacles combined with the horrible controlls make the game extremely frustrating to the point where you quit.\n\nThe game doesn't let you progress very easily. Each track has 5 stars to get. The number of stars you get depends on your performance on the track. By the time I was halfway into world three I had three or more stars on every track. But I still didn't have enough stars to unlock more tracks. It is very hard for players who aren't good at the game to progress.\n\nI payed 99 cents for this game and I still feel like I was ripped off. Don't buy this game. It's a waste of time and money.","July 2, 2014","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was totally surprised though and had so much fun with it. It's pretty simple with you as a biker trying to complete certain course in set times or getting a certain score which helps you unlock the next track, you get the idea. But it brought me back to old school games where you just want to get that next part unlocked and you keep trying and banging your head against the keyboard etc on certain bits. It feels so rewarding when you complete that difficult section that seemed impossible at first.

These stunts are things like jumping as high into the air as possible, or doing as many flips as possible. Each stunt usually has a trick to it so it takes a while to beat each track. Getting five stars can take a while.\n\nI'm surprised that this game has a demo, as the game is pretty short as it is.

There are two types of track - one focuses on getting through the track as fast as possible, but the main type is about completing stunts at specific points on the track. These stunts are things like jumping as high into the air as possible, or doing as many flips as possible. Each stunt usually has a trick to it so it takes a while to beat each track. Getting five stars can take a while.\n\nI'm surprised that this game has a demo, as the game is pretty short as it is. Also, there is no way of turning off the ghosts which appear on time trial maps - you can set it to personal best but there is no off option which is a little annoying.","November 10, 2015","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whilst it does not have the same amount of content and replayability that Trials has, it offers fun gameplay with very creative environments filled with crazy background nonsense like helicopters and ships crashing all over the place! It is not as challenging as Trials is, and the music, graphics, vehicle customisation, and physics are all sub-par to Trials, BUT, overall, it is still a fun game and can be picked up for a very cheap price during any major Steam sale. Enjoy! :D","August 14, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kritigri/recommended/243450/","kritigri","Kritigri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kritigri/","475 products in account","Make no mistake: this is Trials' angsty younger brother trying to show off and be like his cool big bro. The voice acting is cringey, with the biker yelling appreciation or disappointment to the player depending on his performance. The sound design is none too great either, with the bike's engine sounding like it was recorded into an iPhone's mic in a bathroom and not always seeming to sync up with what the bike is actually doing.\n\nThat being said, this is a worthwhile, fun game. The graphics might not be the best, but the level design is brilliant, both in scenery / surrounding events and the gameplay itself. As others have mentioned, it lacks some challenge; you're unlikely to spend 50 faults on one particular section of track like you would in a Trials game, for example. It nevertheless makes for a fun experience.\n\nSomething Urban Trials Freestyle does differently to the Trials games is incorporating in-level challenges. For instance, midway through a level you may be asked to make the longest possible jump or do as many flips as possible. This adds a nice, additional bit of variety to the game. There are also some collectable moneybags throughout the levels which you use to upgrade your bike, though whether this is a help or a hindrance to your playstyle is up to you; typically, they are not too out of the way, and you are encouraged to make separate runs of the tracks for performance and money-collecting.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a good game, but maybe get it on sale.","January 18","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the sense there are levels which get progressively harder and you upgrade your bike to make it progressively better. That being said this is much better than the games like it on IOS that I have tried. But it's no comparison to the AAA version. But the core gameplay mechanics are the same, so if you want more of the same then here it is if you enjoyed the web based version this is like a super deluxe version of that.","February 13","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
