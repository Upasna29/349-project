In order to play this game, there must be a basic understanding of proper guerilla warfare, and knowing this is VERY useful. This game is not for everyone however. This game is a test of skill for those who are familiar with the Men of War series and its mechanics.\n\nA few thoughts after in-depth play (Post Scriptum Edition):\nFirst of all, if you can earn every achievement without cheating, kudos to you. It is not an easy task to earn all of these achievements, because the final US Mission can be quite intimidating on Hard difficulty. Expect to be screaming, "OH MY GOD IT'S LIKE THE FALL OF SAIGON BUT WORSE!" at the end.\nSecond, a quick reading of Sun Tzu's Art of War woyld be useful. You'll know what part I'm referring to if you do read it.\nThird, the game is not broken. I've played it with no issue, so it seems the problem is originating from the user. Sorry, but that's the case. It certainly is not your average Men of War game, so I can understand why people would say this. Compared to Men of War: Condemned Heroes, which is coined as being another 'impossibly difficult' entry in the series, this game is flawless. I think the struggle players encountered with this game is symbolic. The United States certainly did struggle in Vietnam. Everything was about winning through attrition... the player has to win a mission of attrition as well because of how long a single mission can take without losing a single squad member. This was probably not intentional on the developer's part, but still an interesting characteristic.\n\nMen of War: Vietnam offers a unique experience that is not for everyone. If you are new to the series, please take care to avoid this game. This was my first game I bought in the Men of War series, and it was a bitter mistake at first, because most of my time was spent figuring out how to play the game. Definitely don't want to do that here.","June 15, 2015","true","67.7"," 74 of 85 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","74","85","4","2"

However that is not to say this game isn't just as good as it predecessors. I stalled from buying this game for such a long time due to negative reviews and people rating it as 'too' difficult.\n\nThat is part of the games attraction surely, something that presents itself as a challenge? Single player the game is great but multiplayer is where it shines. On comms with a mate (or mates) this game is just as good as the other MOW titles. infact I love the weapons on offer. So it is more unique and in a very politically sensitive backdrop.\n\nI would recommend this game as it is very much in th eflavour of all other MOW games, expect the high detail, anticipate the challenge and also the beautiful levels of micro admin. These series of games offer something very unique and it should be experienced with good mates who you can trust to run through in coop. Not some randoms who want to charge through it guns blazing. Digest the intel, scan the map and devise your path of action and you will be rewarded. Run in without covering your arcs and setting up fall back points for certain missions and you will fail miserably. COOP MP is a must, 4 of you working in unison is brilliant as you can set up multiple ambush points and often smash the enemy in one action, with a well coordinated strike.\n\nA great game, as the rest.","December 22, 2013","true","24.3"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","46","52","2","0"

I have read alot of negative reviews on this game but for many of the levels I have found that a simple flanking manuever or a well executed ambush does the trick.  Still it is very hard and even when you plan and execute perfectly you can still take caualties which is frustrating considering you definatley do not ever have a 3:1 ratio   against your enemy, so save often!  The thick jungle while making it difficult to see at times is an invaluable asset and greatly contributes to the success of the players in the mission where guerilla style tactics are a must.

Like impossible difficult when the option you selected was easy. Like I need to follow the 70 page walkthrough for step by step, cover by cover instructions making the paths in this "strategy" game very narrow ones to follow. In sumary, you will not be able to develope your own strategy (which I though was the point of a strategy game) but have to follow the very narrow ones laid out in a guide or walkthrough. On top of that the interface, controls and feel for the game are annoying at best. (i.e. you must change camera angle in a hurry in order to shoot down a chopper, while switching your soldier's weapon to RPG). It also does not have a professional feel to it either, the voice acting is shoddy, the music is very repetitive (like just 3 guitar chords constantly repeating) and "cut scenes" do nothing to draw you into the story. Don't buy this if your looking for a professional strategy game like WARGAME, TOTAL WAR or even C&C games, you will be sorely dissappointed. However I do recommend MOW: Assault Squad.

This game revolves around spec ops missions using stealth and suprise, almost no helicopter action, and never in the campaign do you command a significant amount of units. HOWEVER, this does not mean that you won't be fighting an enemy that has 100+ units making it seem unrealistic and harder then it should be. Even in the NVA campaign, you lead a squad of 4 against dozens of American troops and WIN. I mean, come on is that BS or what? I cannot, however, complain about the complete lack of a tutorial, as i have other Men of War games. Overall i was expecting and hoping for some helicopter action and moderatly large battles, commanding at least a platoon sized unit, but the game is only about leading a squad against 1000 enemies with rather bad voice acting.

I read all of the reviews, including those on Metacritic and other professional reviewer sites which said it was exceptionally hard.  So, I hummed and hawed, not sure if I should spend the money or not.  I'm glad I did because this game is not so challenging that it is frustrating and I abandon it.  It's challenging, but in the way that we want it to be so that we don't master it in two days and get bored.\n\nThe attention to detail is fantastic as is the sheer number of orders you can command your squad(s) with.  If you want a simple, "no read the manual" kind of game that you have a handle on within 5 minutes, look elsewhere.  But if you're willing to put just a bit more time into it -- not much -- then buy it.\n\nConclusion . . . If you are into the Vietnam conflict, I give this game an 8.7 out of 10.  If you're just a fan of the genre in general, I give it a solid 7.8 out of 10.  My only advice is to stick with it for more than 5 or 10 minutes.","March 16, 2014","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The missions are long and complex but leave you enough room to improvise when things don't go according to plan. The difficulty is punnishing even on easy. You must save A LOT!\nIt's more a squad based action rpg than an rts. But that's fine by me. It's an interesting and fun perspective on the Vietnam war. The camera is close enough to the action that you get a sense of claustrophobic tension of jungle warfare.\nThe AI can be deviously challenging and won't just stand around waiting to get shot. You really have to keep on your toes.\nThe graphics are surprisingly good, despite it's age. There are no noteworthy bugs to mention.\nA great addition to the Men Of War series.","April 23, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it is still prity difficalt on easy its still playable, and also while there are parts of the missions that will be hard sometimes the intier mission is not hard. Also many people say there are bugs but i have come across none. The editor is dicent it's not as good as the rest of men of war but it is still a good game.

If you try to sneak around to get behind the bunkers in the mission "What a Job!" you can F@#$%& by traps and you are forced to run at a heavy mg that can kill your whole squad in 5 bursts and i did manage to get through one time and i tossed a grenade at the Mg it did NOTHING and on the mission "When Trouble troubles you" HOW IN THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FIGHT AN ARMY WITH 2 NVA AND 2 RUSSIANS!?!?!?!?!? well you ♥♥♥♥ing cant even with Rpg's and Draganovs but still this game is bad because of that so i hope the Developers step up their game instead of sit around with their thumbs up their asses and i highly doubt they give a ♥♥♥♥ about this review but yeah this is why i do not Recommend this game at all.","May 15, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

None of them are here. Right mouse button being the move and action button like every other RTS made since the late 90s? Nah. Skirmish mode, with an AI who understands how to move its units around and a challenging, fun, and dynamic mode to play with friends? Nah. A campaign based both around the heroism of small units mixed with the grand scope and scale of an RTS game? Not really! (Note: that one was even in Men of War 1, so I have no idea why it isn't here)\n\nCombine that with the lack of vehicles, the lack of any sort of mutable tactics from their WW2 titles (I.E there is nothing really here that screams "Vietnam," it could just as easily be "Men of War: Japan in the Phillipines") and you get one depressingly shallow cash in from the B developers of the Men of War series.

But that is a rather small detail, so if you can over look that, you'll find a fun and engaging games that will give you great memories of epic battles and daring escapes.\n\nIt should be noted however that in true Viet Nam war style, the battles are more compact and frantic, this isnt like the other MoW where you could throw wave after wave of soldiers till you eventually win, you have to be careful, and make the best use of all your abilities and gear, as well as looting as much as you can from the corpses","October 11, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
