"http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialpayday/recommended/294460/","officialpayday","[Cash.net] Mr. Payday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialpayday/","702 products in account","Fenix Rage brings back the fun of classic hardcore platformer action. It's mainly inspired by Super Meat Boy and most levels really have the same difficulty as you had in Super Meat Boy. If you are an old-skool gamer like me you will have lots of fun with this challenging game. Instead of raging I'm mostly smiling. Why? Because hardcore platformers almost aren't produced (anymore). Super Meat Boy has been a while back now, and after completing that it was really time for some new hardcore platformer to make me frustrated and give me a real challenge.\n\nThe game has over 200 levels, each as frustrating as any and each level can be played in 3 different modes: normal, challenge and godmode. I am yet to figure out what godmode is, as I haven't unlocked that yet. Normal let's you play through the levels, well.. "normally", while challenge gives you even more of a challenge by limiting the dashes and jumps you can make per level. Besides that there's also one cookie in every level to collect to unlock (real-life!) recipes and there's hidden "red cubes" which you can collect to unlock a bonus world with hidden levels that give you even more of a challenge.\n\nThere's 4 different themed worlds, each with their own unique (challenging and frustrating!) boss and after you beat the last one you unlock another 4 new themed worlds, which are inspired on the levels from the first 4 worlds, again with entirely new unique bosses. You could see the other 4 worlds as the "dark world" from Super Meat Boy, so to speak.\n\nThe last 4 worlds will definitely give you the real challenge, and I've spent a couple of hours already trying to beat these. I am currently at 8 hours of playtime and only in world 5, so the game will give you atleast 20-25 hours of unique playtime, so it's really worth the money!\n\nAfter you beat everything you can collect yellow stars, by completing each level within the timelimit that the developers set for each level. These yellow stars can be spent in the "arcade shop" where you can buy about 10 unique minigames and where you can try to get into the highscores, which are shared online through Steam. The best times of each level can also be seen on online leaderboards. Then there's also a lot of achievements to collect, including hidden ones, so this will surely keep you busy for a while! :)\n\nThe graphics are also unique and stylish and the soundtrack is sweet and gets you pumped, although perhaps they could have used more varying tracks for different worlds.\n\nI would give this game a 9/10. I would say regularly update the game with new levels or perhaps add a level editor with the ability to share your levels and worlds online to make this a perfect game. I would also love to see more of the "Fenix Box" levels, which look very classic (I believe from early in-dev times).\n\nOther than that, retro hardcore platformer, surely recommended, especially for this price! Developers are also very nicely in touch with the community and are actively listening to your feedback. :)","September 25, 2014","true","20.9"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","0"

The response to the controls felt really good, and I could command great control of the character. The game starts out leading you to believe "okay, this isn't going to be THAT hard...." ..... but after only a few levels in, you realize what you are in for. Flying chaos involving jumping, dashing, fire, and ice.\n\nI keep seeing reviews comparing this to Super Meat Boy, which I have also played. I liked SMB as well, but this game does have an altogether different feel to it, which I like. I have a few hours in and have barely scratched the surface and look forward to playing more!\n\nOh, and one more thing.

Different from SMB is the ability to dash, providing the gamer a reward of finishing a level more quickly at the risk of not having as much control over Fenix. The gameplay is flawless. It is truly the gamer's fault for dying -- which you will, a lot -- and not the game getting in the way of itself.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game is that my hand became tired while playing the first boss level as I was frantically trying to dash and jump my way through the level. At the time of this review I have played through the entire first world obtaining all the cookies in those first 20 levels.\n\nI would consider this a must play if you enjoy the highly difficult yet satisfying platforming games.","September 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

(I'm currently in the middle of World 5.)\n\nThere is a distinct lack of enemy variety. Predominantly, all you'll see are enemies that move back and forth in a straight line, or that jump in place, which is nearly the same thing. It isn't until you've completed around 80 levels that you'll see enemies with different movement patterns, and by that point I had already grown tired of the level design. Even many of those later levels apparently focus on the straight-line enemies.\n\nSimilarly, maneuvering Fenix often involves no more than button-mashing to take a straight line through openings in between the aforementioned enemies. In most cases, you'll either mash the jump button to ascend, or the dash button to move sideways. There are no precise wall kicks or nuanced, curved jumps, and Fenix's vertical speed feels rather slow. The idea of infinite jumps and air dashes sounded exciting, but ended up being more simplistic and repetitive than I expected.\n\nIf neither point fazes you, and you seek another precision platformer, I'd say there's a good chance you'll enjoy this, even if it didn't quite meet my personal expectations. Otherwise, perhaps you'd be better off with another entry in the genre.","January 7, 2015","false","3.3"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

And why so much of it especially? Like, I just. I can't get past that. A lot of the bosses and even some of the stages (world 5 especially) have huge RNG factors in their levels. In a precision platformer! Idiots! Ugh.\n\nOh, also, it's not really a platformer? No need to jump between platforms, you have infinite jump and dash. It's more a flying game than a platformer, and that's fine, the levels are designed with that in mind.\nBut then. Why are the walls so sticky if you literally have no reason to wall jump, ever? Really quite annoying.\n\nAnd a good chunk of the levels in the game are just... enemy spam. No rhyme or reason, toss enemies everywhere, just let the player figure it out, WHATEVER AHAHA. That's another thing. There's just too many levels, for how little creativity is on display. It gets stale, the only really big shift comes in world 9, where a lot of the better levels are simply due to being unique, but even that world has some enemy spam levels too.\n\nAll the worlds are pretty visually indistinct, as well. Bright colors, thick line style, similar fake-guitar gamey-type music that I turned off at some point out of annoyance. Can't tell the worlds apart. It even does the super meat boy "dark world" type thing (not even close to the only thing it steals from that game and doesn't understand; cookies = bandages, red cubes = warp zones, etc.) but because the worlds are so indistinct it doesn't even matter. And the dark world remixes of a lot of levels... aren't noticeably different. Really the game barely even has a difficulty curve, it stays in about the same place throughout the entire game, I felt, maybe a tiiiiny bit harder?\n\nThere's plenty to like here too though. The two extra modes, challenge mode and god mode, are both pretty interesting twists that are definitely more than just "replay the entire game but in a slightly different way" and I enjoyed both for the most part (though some god mode levels are a bit too strict with their time limits, I feel. Meh.) The controls are good and polished and all, never had issues with jumps or dashes being dropped. It's hard without ever being as crazy-hard as meat boy or dustforce or the like, but the option to speedrun and collect goodies gives you extra, optional challenges, and there's plenty of content here for your money.\n\nI wouldn't call it an awful game but it doesn't stand out in my mind beyond the negatives and I don't see myself returning to it. It'd be in the "meh" category if steam had one of those. (Seriously, get on that, valve, "yay or nay" is not enough options.)","May 12, 2015","false","19.5"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","15"

It has a very Super Meat Boy feel to the controls which is great. But what makes the game really fun is the clever level design.\n\nI appreciate the instant restarts. When a game is a brutal as this one is sometimes then I really want to get back in the action right away. But don't get me wrong, the levels are well crafted making you think about how to approach a series of obstacles either through trail and error or pausing for a moment to mentally traverse the level planning an optimal route.\n\nThe first couple levels show the game mechanics in a rather uninspired way. But you won't stay bored for long, the game almost immediately starts challenging your skills and focus. New mechanics are introduced regularly and continue to ramp the difficulty of the game nicely.\n\nThe inclusion of extra mini-games is welcome as well. It nice they thought about rewarding players with more than just achievements for completing the games extra challenges. They might be just short distractions, but much better than nothing.\n\nOverall if you like challenging platformers I recommend you pick this one up.

Sweet, colorful graphics, nice music, REALLY tight and responsive controls, great game overall!\n\nThere's only one thing that's a little bit problematic. That is restart of the lever after you die.

While Super Meat Boy has momentum-based movement, Fenix Rage controls more like Donkey Kong Country (in that you stop moving immediately when you let go of the analog stick. Side Note: I prefer movement like this, but that's just personal preference). What's unique about Fenix Rage is that the main character has infinite jumps and dashes that you can use whenever you want.\n\n"But wait!", you say. "Doesn't that ruin the game?"\n\nNot at all. The levels are designed around this over-powered movement style. In fact, you will die - a lot. That's okay, though because the respwan is *instant* (which is FANTASTIC). It feels less like you're dying repeatedly and more like you're just learning the level and playing it until you beat it. The levels are actually not *that* difficult (I found myself flying through level after level), but an optional cookie that you can get in each level ups the challenge dramatically. I found getting the cookies super-rewarding and loved the added gameplay this provided.\n\nThe art is charming and unique, the soundtrack rocks and is fun to listen to and the level design is great. The difficulty ramps up so gradually that near the end of the game you're doing straight-up ridiculous maneuvers to stay alive, but it never feels overwhelming. With over 200 levels - including arcade mode and secret warp zone levels - there's a lot of game here.\n\nEverything is not rainbows and unicorns, however. Some levels have enemies moving really fast in tight, confined spaces. Getting past these types of enemies felt more like luck than skill. The same goes for dashing through tiny 'one-block-high' holes in walls - that *always* felt like luck to me. Also, the little green squares (the main enemies in the game) are used *a lot*. Like, "bordering-on-too-much a lot". I honestly think they're used too much. I would have liked to have seen more variety in the gameplay. Different types of enemies, more patterns to evade and so on. With four Light worlds, four Dark worlds, a secret ninth world and warp zones there are a LOT of levels here. There's no reason to have a single mechanic (the dodging of square enemies) be used SO much. There are other mechanics in the game, though (I don't want to make it seem like that's all the game is). The variety of gameplay is good, but I would have liked to have seen more.\n\nTL;DR : Fenix Rage is a fast, frantic precision platformer that's a lot of fun. The controls feel fantastic. The level design is great except for a few places that feel 'cheap' (depending more on luck than skill). With tons of levels (over 200), exciting boss battles and lots of optional objectives, it's a game that you'll be playing for a while. An excellent game by Green Lava Studios and I look forward to whatever they're working on next. :)\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.5 out of 10","October 6, 2014","true","96.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Full disclosure - I still love it.\n\nFenix Rage marries the best things about many other platformers while bending conventional thinking.  My personal favorite is the fact that in most platformers you need...well...platforms.  In Fenix Rage it's optional to land on one in each given level once you take off.  Some levels don't even have platforms.  With infinite jump and infinite dash are given to you you'd think that a platformer should be easy...right?\n\nWell...no.  Fenix Rage is not for the faint of heart.  If you don't like frustratingly difficult levels levels, or sweating on your controller, or shouting curse words then you probably won't enjoy this game.  That's the honest truth.  However, if you do like a challenge, the satisfaction of completely hardcore levels, and most importantly bragging rights with your friends, then you'll REALLY like this one.\n\nWith over 200 levels each world offers new challenges that keep you on your toes throughout the entire game.  With these types of games tight controls are extremely important and Fenix Rage doesn't deal the cheap death card.  When you die, it's your fault.  With each death you will learn...if only a little...what you did wrong.\n\nWhen you work on a game for a long time by the time you launch it the last thing you want to do is play it.  That's not the case with Fenix Rage for me.\n","September 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","22","40","0","0"

The controls are incredibly responsive and the levels are almost always innovative.\n\nFenix is as difficult as you want it to be. Just want to get to the end of each level? That's fine, touch the blue square and you've unlocked the next level. Want to finish it fast? Great, each level has a time to beat, and you get a gold star if you do. Want to finish it efficiently? Challenge mode limits the number of jumps and dashes you get to reach the end, and you'll get a red star. Are you a manifestation of pure, unbridled skill? Play Godmode like the god you are.\n\nAnother review I read described it as a Super Meat Boy + Flappy Bird + Sonic the Hedgehog hybrid.. which is pretty accurate. For what it's worth, I'd say it's less grotesque than Super Meat Boy, far less repetitive than Flappy Bird (what isn't), and far more responsive than Sonic.\n\nPerhaps my favorite design feature in this game is that you respawn instantly after dying. I mean INSTANTLY. In Super Meat Boy, there's about 1/3 second of delay after you die, but in Fenix Rage, it's literally a few milliseconds before you can move again. Did you screw up during the stage? Push one button and BOOM instant respawn. It's amazing.\n\nFrom a pure gameplay perspective, Fenix wins. He just feels... powerful. However, the game could be more polished in its ambiance. The music is okay, but not as memorable as it is in VVVVVV or Dustforce. Dustforce actually creates an amazing ambiance with lush backgrounds, although that might just be my personal aesthetic preference.\n\nLastly, this is just my personal gripe but none of these platformers ever has a real plot. They're always pretty half-baked, which is to be expected given the focus is on the gameplay, but still it would be nice to have say a choose your own adventure type deal with a good ending / bad ending / different levels depending on what you pick.

Run and jump (or dash in this case) from a to b in increasingly difficult levels, split across uniquely defined worlds with boss fights. The real pull of the game as with the above noted titles being that once you've ran from start to finish you'll want to do it again and again and again until you're pulling out your hair / balding and have smashed a controller but have perfected 1 of 200 levels, thus the name Fenix RAGE....it's a game which finds an absolute sweet spot for balance between prompting ragequit and outright leaderboard addiction.\n\nWhen I did most of my playthrough of this I was jumping between two titles, Super Meat Boy & Fenix Rage. It amazed me just how much Fenix rage could take small influences from a game which is undoubtedly top of the tree but still not feel in anyway inferior or like a blatent rip and the reason for that is because they share similar themes, both can be crushingly difficult if you're going for perfect runs, both encourage leaderboarding but from a pure mechanics point of view this is it's own game. The dash mechanics, the sliding down walls to set your character on fire and melt through ice or becoming ice to drop through a laser unharmed - it's extremely subtle but very, very clever and all packaged up nicely with exceptional character design / artwork and a memorable retro soundtrack.\n\nIt's one of those games that most people that played loved enough to drop gushing reviews but when a game has at time of writing 95 reviews clearly not enough people played it.\n\n**as far as im aware the game will relaunch on console as Fenix Furia and a large PC patch will follow in the coming months which im hopeful along with introducing the multiplayer which I've seen being played at Gaming Expos, possibly Steam Cloud saving, possibly fully functional steam overlay, will give this game it's second wind and a degree of the success on Steam which such a well made and fun game deserves**","February 16","true","16.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Is it hard? Yes! Is it bad? Actually, no, it's surprisingly good! It has a unique dash mechanic which changes the game quite drastically, also, infinite double jumping! The controls are simple and very responsive too. It looks decent, but it isn't going to blow your mind in any way, except for maybe the last world. The music is pretty basic, nothing special, you probably should listen to your own soundtrack.\n\nThe level design is overall pretty good with some exceptions, a few of them are VERY luck-based and can get frustrating because of it. The biggest problem in my opinion are the difficulty-spikes, I had much more trouble with the first boss than with the last boss for example, maybe you get stuck in one levels and in the next you don't even die once, it's pretty weird. About those levels, there are a lot of them, each with secondary objectives like getting cookies (you can unlock real-life cookie recipes!) and more. Completing everything (+ secondary objectives) could easily take you 80+ hours (depending on your skill level).\n\nOverall I would say it's pretty fun and satisfying to play (aside from a few luck-based level) and you should consider getting it if you loved Super Meat Boy.\n\nMy rating would be a 7/10","December 21, 2014","true","21.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

They're both very diffcult platformers. However, while Super Meat Boy features a single (or double if you play as certain characters) jump, in Fenix Rage, you can jump an infinite amount of times. You can also dash left or right an infinite amount of times. It's a very different experience, and I'd argue a better, albeit shorter one.\n\nThe visuals are extremely impressive; much more so than Super Meat Boy. Menus pop, animations are fluid, and the game overall looks fantastic. It was very nice to look at after playing so many games that opt to take the 16 bit graphics route, which I despise. The cutscenes look great too. Yes, there is a story, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. However, games like this are rarely about the story, so this is easily forgiven.\n\nThe game features many different things to do. The basic premise is to get from point A to point B, but there some twists to this. First, there is a cookie hidden in each level. If you find all of them in a world (20 levels, 20 cookies), you will unlock a cookie recipe. That's pretty neat. There are occasionally red boxes hidden in levels two; about 2 or 3 in a world. If you get to them in time, you'll unlock a level in a secret world, which automatically rewards you with a cookie if you complete it. There are also 3 different stars you can earn in each level. A yellow star can be earned for completing a level in a certain amount of time, a red star can be earned for completing a level by only using a certain number of dashes and jumps, and a blue star can be earned in a mode called "God Mode." In God Mode, you'll be invincible, and have to touch all of the enemies on the screen (thereby killing them) in a time limit.\n\nYellow stars are decently hard to earn. I'm not really into speedrunning, so I only earned about 40 of them. However, yellow stars are also the most important. You can unlock minigames by spending yellow stars. Red stars and blue stars can't be used for anything, which is unfortunate, but not a huge deal. The minigames are... decent. If you're looking for a simple diversion when you're really, really bored, these will probably do. Otherwise, you'll probably only play them once.\n\nRed stars are the most fun to earn, in my opinion. Only being able to jump or dash a certain number of times adds a new challenge to the game. I had a good time earning all of them.\n\nI wasn't that excited about God Mode, though. I think I earned about 10 blue stars before I stopped wanting to earn any more. As said before, I'm not really into speedrunning, so the concept didn't really appeal to me very much in the first place, but they're also very hard; much, much harder to obtain than yellow stars. I've A+'d all of the light world (and many of the Dark World) levels in Super Meat Boy, but many of the levels in Fenix Rage are ridiculously hard to earn a blue star in. If you like to speedrun games, you'll probably like it more than I did, but it wasn't for me.\n\nThere are 10 worlds in total, with 20 levels in each. You can't earn stars in the secret world levels, so that leaves 180 levels that you can beat in 3 different ways. 4, if you count beating it normally. While I've only put about 13 hours into it, they were very enjoyable. I highly reccomend this game.","May 11, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I guess for some it may be difficult, but to me it's just a button masher. I tried to like this game--significant time investment, stars, cookies, top 20 times on most levels--but after a certain point it falls flat.\n\nI recommend skipping it.\n\nInstead give Dustforce or Runner a try. Or for a similar style to this, the Jumper series. Or, if you haven't played Super Meatboy, go grab that now.","March 13, 2015","false","11.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"
