I will tell you: that may be a mistake.\n\nIf video games were people in a Hollywood high school movie, Fearless Fantasy would probably be that odd, quiet girl who sits alone during lunch.  Most people know she exists, but don’t necessarily acknowledge her existence— best she just stay in the corner “where she belongs.”  Then when the jock has to talk to her (on a dare), we find out she is indeed a bit odd and won’t ever fit in with the popular crowd… but she is also surprisingly fun and suddenly attractive when you give her a chance to take off her glasses and let her hair down.\n\nMany people will automatically dismiss this game because it uses ideas rooted in mobile-gaming.  That is their prerogative.  All I know is that I only play games on PC, and I play many different games— and I found Fearless Fantasy to be one of the more enjoyable games I have personally played.  It isn’t the best, but it is better than many.\n\nWhat makes this game enjoyable is the combination of nostalgia-evoking, tried-and-true, core RPG mechanics (turn-based combat, level ups, skill points, and items) with some modern zest (using the mouse to make gestures to execute abilities), and a light, casual style and storyline.  While you play, it simultaneously feels comfortably familiar and interestingly novel.\n\nMany games try to find ways to spice up the classic turn-based-RPG combat style; one of the best I have seen is the swipe-and-click gesturing used in Fearless Fantasy.  Instead of just clicking “attack” and watching your character attack, you have to use your mouse to perform various combinations of swiping and clicking, involving timing and precision.  I thought it was exceedingly fun trying to pull off the advanced moves on the high difficulty.\n\nWith the relative ease and short length of this game, it is a great candidate for a quick bite of a variety in your gaming diet.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 11, 2015","true","4.9"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","60","67","3","0"

It is working, there are no bugs, it has start and end, and there are even a challenge of some kind! Like in the famous Osu! title.\nBut, just like with Osu! and even worse... its main part, the battle system, is strongly tied to touchscreens. You just can't do same shift with mouse, and don't even try to use joysticks, trackballs or something like that.\nI repeat again - this game is designed to mash and sweep your finger via screen, back and forth. And it is quite good only in that.\nBut here we are - at PC station. I know, somebody might have a notebook with touchsreen, but statistically it is an imperceptible minority among usual mouse+keyboard users. And there that game fits as well as a fifth wheel.\n\nI see that almost a quarter of my friends already bought it, probably in some bundle, or with 90% discount. And ALL of them either not touched it at all, or idled for 5 hours, to get all cards. Well, that's the way to go! To beat it and get all achievements... too much honor for that cheapshot.\n\nAvoid.

I purchased it purely for its intriguing art style and was greeted with humor, two characters that nearly sound like Steve Blum and Mark Hamill's Joker, and a turn-based combat system based on timing and tracing.\n\nI really like the art, especially for the monsters. They were just enjoyable to look at before I slaughtered them. The monster designs range from humorous to creepy (pay attention to their names too). The stills that were in place for the cinematics were not very interesting visually, but the humor usually takes priority during those sections.\n\nThe voice acting seems decent enough and light-hearted. Joshua Tomar kept throwing me off with his Steve Blum impression. Adam Harrington's voice kept on giving me serious Joker vibes. Both made my experience with the game even weirder.\n\nThe combat system can be difficult to master. Tracing with the mouse did not work out well for me unless I played on Casual or Normal (you can set the difficulty manually for each level). There are three characters with different specialities (damage/debuff, buffing/taunting, healing/defensive) with five different skills available for leveling up. None of them are too amazing, but it's satisfying to trace a perfectly timed path and scoring an epic or flawless rating for very high damage or bonus effects. Look at the first trailer for the game to have a fairly accurate idea of how the tracing mechanic works (you path your mouse through arrows).\n\nFearless Fantasy is a strange, little game that might be enjoyable for you. Let the art style consume you.","January 2, 2015","true","6.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","2"

It's got the soul of a mobile game whereby you swipe, tap and do other gestures for successful attack/defense moves. And this is a really bad idea when your finger is replaced by a mouse, which makes the game feel clunky and awkward. The art style of the game sure is bizzare, but not in  a good way. Sure I appreciate the surreal feel of the game, but the artist didn't do the best job with the main characters - They look like an anime-crazy 10 year old drew them. The voice acting is cheesy at best, and the script matches it perfectly - Again not in a good way. I would only recommend playing this on a mobile device. Avoid playing this on PC unless you are okay with the controls and all the things I complained of.","June 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","35","57","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/282100/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","Fearless Fantasy is a RPG that seemingly tripped, fell down the rabbit hole and landed somewhere in an anime universe. There are strange creatures, over the top dialogue, and some interesting reactive based combat. One thing I will say about Fearless Fantasy is it doesn't really hold back, it wears what it is on its sleeve. This is very obviously meant for a mobile device but nonetheless finds itself on Steam. To be frank, Fearless Fantasy is like a funny tasting alcohol, it is unique but definitely an acquired taste. One that certain people may like, others not so much.\n\nThe reason for that is Fearless Fantasy goes against the grain in most regards of traditional RPGs. The art style is what caught me off guard the most. The monsters in Fearless Fantasy are not your typical, orcs, goblins, and oozes that we have all grown up with. These nightmarish creatures seemingly stepped out of a Dr. Seuss book. With strange vibrant colors and wicked smiling faces coming out of other wicked smiling faces. This sets the tone for the game and lets you know that this isn't your standard RPG. On top of the onslaught of twisted creatures, Fearless Fantasy has a bit of an anime edge in the character design.\n\nThe story of Fearless Fantasy is very simplistic and very light on plot. There is a Princess, Hero/Mercenary, evil fiance, giant monster that can eat everybody. It's story, in my opinion, is not really the main focus but it is present and quirky. In between missions you are occasionally gifted with slight animations that give some personality to the characters. The characters have a light-hearted tone that is reminiscent of anime, this makes the characters seem somewhat vapid in nature. This will throw some people off but I didn't mind it all too much. The scenes are voiced acted well but sadly they lack any color, which takes a bit away from the scenes and also some footage is reused in certain situations.\n\nTo shake things up even more is Fearless Fantasy's combat. Again this is where this game holds its heart on its sleeve. The combat is completely meant for a mobile platform, you poke, swipe, and swish for all your abilities and attacks. On the Steam version, your mouse replaces your finger and this is quite jarring at first. I love the idea of the combat system as it keeps the player involved in a way that traditional turn based RPG's don't. If you miss an attack there is no one else to blame but yourself, if you critical hit, you did well. Where the problems begin is that there is no time given for you to practice your skills. You essentially learn the combination of swipes and taps as you play. This leads to wasted attacks and some grinding just so you can figure out what you're doing. On higher difficulties? Forget it!\n\nWhile I cannot comment on the mobile version of the game, I can say that on PC the mouse feels somewhat clunky in combat. Lacking the swishing grace that a finger has as the attacks get more complicated and faster as you progress through the game. There is other minor issues with combat, while the tutorial does explain the basics. Things like enemy status ailments are never explained, it was only until my fifth mission I realized I could click on my party and see what the negative buff was. Despite the issues though the combat can be fun and highly reactive. I should mention there is also a shop with items and upgrades. The shop fills in the required RPG aspects and gives that grinding a point, and lets you spend gold.\n\nOther areas of the game do what they can for being a mobile heavy game. The options menu is somewhat bare. The map which contains your levels is drawn well but static.  On the other hand, the audios of Fearless Fantasy are fantastic. The music never got dull for me and was exciting and fun when it needed to be. The sound effects having the necessary oomph when a critical hit landed or swish of a dodged blow. The attack animations themselves while eventually repeated, looked fantastic the first time I used them. Dazzling the screen with effects I wasn't expecting.\n\nReplay value and length are up to the player. The game includes the standard 3 star achievement hunt. This is divided by difficulty per area/scene of the game. Increasing the difficulty of the reactive combat. This feels a little grindy but still adds welcomed replay value. The story mode can probably be beaten in about two to three hours. The higher difficulties will take much longer.\n\nTo sum up, Fearless Fantasy is not everyone's cup o' tea, but I was surprised and interested to see how different the game was. I think some bold moves and design decisions were made here and I think the good far outweighs the bad. Even if you're not a fan of the art decisions and story. The combat is unique. I would love to see what this kind of combat could be like in a dedicated PC title and made a little bit more friendly for the mouse.\n\nAs always I encourage you to do a bit more research, but the game isn't overwhelmingly priced at $6.99. You could always catch it on sale but I think the game offers more then enough even at its base price. Especially if you are looking for something that dares to try something a little new and a little weird.","August 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The streamlined design works to its advantage with a hands-on battle system that does a nice job of getting the player more involved. While the software itself is soundly designed, however, the omission of touchscreen technology support is quite glaring and would have enhanced the game’s tightly focused battle engine. The use of mouse, while functional and serviceable, takes away from the true potential of the gesture-heavy gameplay. As it stands now, though, Fearless Fantasy is still a nicely streamlined role playing battle marathon.\n\nLook to the "Troll" move, which attracts the enemies' attention by performing signature dance moves from Gangnam Style.","July 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The art style is\ndistinctive, and may not appeal to everyone, but for what it is, it is well\ndone. The game does implement a star system to encourage replay-ability\nto see how fast you can complete each level.\n\nYou have the choice of three characters with a variety of different\nstrengths and weaknesses.  You level up abilities as a team, and each team\nmember has abilities that can be used to regain energy or mitigate attacks\nnot only to that character, but across to other characters.\n\nThe story is what ties the game together;  it propels you forward, and\nthe cut scenes are not overdone.  You can choose your difficulty level for\neach mission, and the combat is done on a turn-based basis.  You attack by\ndrawing a line, and the quality of how seamlessly you attack will affect\nhow much damage you do.  Each ability has a unique way on how you attack,\nrequiring that you learn exactly what your abilities do, and think out how\nyou will be attacking each turn.\n\nThe game accomplishes what it set out to do very well.

Didn't see you there.\nI'm here today to talk to you about this game called Final F... I mean, Fearless Fantasy.\nIt's a neat little Indie RPG game with some hilarious and over-the-top dialogue, phenomenal soundtrack and great voice acting.\n\nThe game has no free roam option or anything like that, you go from mission to mission, level up and buy new stuff.. The usual. The combat style is really similar "as you can imagine" to Final Fantasy games, turn based combat.\nBut the combat itself is something pretty different and unusual for these kinds of RPG games, Have you ever heard of or played "Osu!" because that's how the combat plays out. You pick what you wanna do when it's your turn and then you move your cursor around according to your attacks like you were playing Osu!.\n\nAs mentioned before, the voice acting, overall writing for the dialogue and soundtrack are all freaking amazing.\nIn addition i'd like to say that the character designs for especially the enemies are absolutely gorgeous, well maybe not gorgeous but unique and likeable.. I'll still go with gorgeous, gorgeous in their hideous and ugly way. I also love how the camera works during battles, it's very cinematic and makes everything look so darn epic.\n\nThere's not much actual story being shown discarding the cutscenes that look like some childs' doodles on Paint.\nBut i do love how the characters have their little discussions with each other after a battle, teaching us more about the lore and the story and doing some character development which is always a plus in a RPG game.\n\nI have to admit though, the game felt bit too difficult at the beginning.. Or maybe it's just that the game is so fast paced i just didn't have time to really practise anything.\n\nThe game also looks like a Mobile port but i'm pretty sure Fearless Fantasy actually never was a Mobile Game to begin with. So that's cool.\n\nOverall it's a pretty solid game with very few issues and a cheap price tag.\n\nBuy it if you enjoy playing either Final Fantasy or Osu!..

That girl happens to be the same person who requested the rescue. As Leon finds out the hard way, the girl happens to be a princess who is running from an arranged marriage with the mad King Xola. They are later accompanied by Vonn, a fellow monster hunter, to stop the mad King and his pet Deothas to save the kingdom!\n\nGameplay, of course, is where the game shines. The game has a map which shows progression throughout. The player is given the chance to buy items before battles or practice previous encounters the player has already beaten. You can also spend experience and skill points on techniques on the overworld map.\n\nThe battle system is classic turn based with an Active Time Battle system similar to\nthe mid Final Fantasy games (4-9). Character turns are determined as these fill up. The fun part about the gameplay is the combat. When you attack, defend, or perform special techniques, special arrows appear throughout the screen. Hovering your mouse through these arrows will determine if your attack is effective or not or how much damage you take. A grading system is there to rate how accurate you are. Get an EPIC bonus on special techniques by filling up a grading gauge and you get special bonuses and buffs. These buffs are an essential part of combat and can be the meaning of life or death in the harder levels. Getting a successful buff and seeing that EPIC flash is a rewarding part of the game.\n\nThe enemies are fair and the game makes all of their special attacks and properties known by hovering over them. This gives you complete control over the battle and gives you time to plan accordingly. This gives battles a unique and strategic vibe where you are given all the information you need to be successful and not get caught off guard. Deaths are fair in this regard as you can only really blame yourself for not planning ahead.  Skill points and attribute points can also be redistributed before battles so you can plan your party beforehand. Items are also relatively cheap and you can also train in previous stages so beating the game is not too difficult.\n\nThe game takes on average 4 or 5 hours trying to beat both Veteran and Normal. This is pretty short but the game regardless is loads of fun and recommended for those who enjoy a simple and fun diversion.\n","July 28, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The player starts with the protagonist saving a damsel in distress and from that point on, their adventure begins. Though the voice-acting and cinematics aren't that good, the game art is actually great but the main selling point of the game is its battle system. Unlike the traditional turn-based RPGs where you just click attack and then your character performs it, Fearless Fantasy brings the excitement in every turn because for each attack command you execute, you have to successfully complete a certain minigame (like you have to click some circles at the right time or follow an arrow path at the right time) in order for your attack to successfully land on your enemies. The same also applies for dodging enemy attacks. The game design is also more like that of the minigame Cut the Rope where each stage is rated by stars but in Fearless Fantasy, the stars corresponds to the game difficulty on each stage.\n\nI recommend this game to those out there who wants to try a different kind of Turn-based RPG game. The game's rate of replayability would rely more on how you can adapt to the game's battle system. Get it when it goes on sale. The game has a lot of potential but I hope the devs would reconsider a sequel to it.\n\nPersonal Rating:Gameplay: 9/10\nMusic: 6/10\nStory/Plot: 6/10\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nOverall: 7/10","August 23, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The story is not something that you necessarily play this game for, and it feels as though this game is was never meant for PC. It feels like this game was always meant for mobile, and that it was a last second change over to Steam. This game could even very well be for mobile (I haven't researched it), and if it is, I'm sure it is a great mobile experince. The experience on PC is actually quite good for it as well, if a little odd. The enemies are easily the oddest part of the game, with enemies I cannot even begin to describe because they are entirely unique to this game.\n\nThis game is solid, if bizarre.

I was shocked when I played it because the music and voice acting is awesome! It's the kind of music you can enjoy by leaving it looping for a long time when you minimize the game. The gameplay takes a little practice (2-10 minutes) to understand the timing and get the hang of, but it is worth it. You can level grind all completed levels and even if you lose a battle, as long as you made at least 1 kill, you still get rewarded with EXP and money, so you don't get that angry "I wasted my time" feeling when you die. The saving is automatic after each battle. If you aren't sure what to spend your stat points in or which upgrade to buy, pick the ones you want and roll a (real) dice (such as, the last number, decides which one to upgrade to and other numbers = reroll). If you limited it down to only 2, you can use even/odd and do "best out of 5". I found using this method, takes away the stress of not being able to decide. Anyway, I think this game it's self is worth $3 USD, so if you find a few games that add up to $3 or 1 game for $3+, I recommend it.\n\nSo far in my gameplay, the game hasn't gotten overly complicated and I can always go back to level 1 in an instant, without having to run for 30 minutes to get to it.","July 24, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/recommended/282100/","bolm","Gänseblümchen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bolm/","593 products in account","Comprehensive, in-depth video review: (written review below)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZXEu7xzLcA\nFirst of all, let’s delve into the graphical fidelity of Fearless Fantasy and let me be frank with you here, this game looks rubbish. Two-dimensional artwork that has a varying degree of texture resolution ranging from low to incredibly low. The characters are disconnected from the world due to a lack of shadows. The spell effects trot along the same lines. Honestly, the only good thing I can say about the aesthetics of Fearless Fantasy is that at least the enemy design is creative and even wackier than Dark Scavenger.\n\nThe sound design of Fearless Fantasy also has a huge variance in terms of quality. While the sound effects and music are decent, though highly forgettable, the voice actors on the other hand, oh boy. It has to be said though, that these voice actors had to work with possibly the worst dialog I have ever had the pleasure to witness. Just have a listen for yourself.\nAnd “Jimmery biscuits.” Is not even the worst thing you will hear while playing this game. There is such an obnoxious amount of “something something … NOT” jokes in Fearless Fantasy, that I probably should go see my dentist due to all the cringing that I was forced to conduct while playing. So while the art style evokes possible humoristic influences of Terry Pratchett or the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, the game instead throws boring and repetitive low-blow jokes into your way. Disappointing.\n\nNow, let’s get to the gameplay and the core innovative idea of Fearless Fantasy. The combination of turn-based combat with timed mouse gestures. Honestly, the idea is actually really good. The first few combat scenarios are interesting, require some getting used to in terms of timing, and are genuinely refreshing to play. Sadly, the fun only lasts for so long, as a ton of problems surface very soon. First of all, every ability and every attack each has its same pattern, so that sooner or later you will know exactly what is coming up and start mindlessly gesturing across the screen. I would have highly preferred to have a randomised pattern to keep things constantly interesting. To make matters even worse, sometimes my mouse clearly went through one of the arrows, for example in a straight line, however for whatever reason, one of the arrows was not registered and therefore the attack had a significant lower damage amount. Which brings me to my next point in combat. Even though I really do like that hitting the timing perfectly empowers your ability and matching the timing of enemy’s attacks reduces their effectiveness, this while system is incredibly inconsistent. I did several tests, restarting the same level over and over again and found that even if I managed to get a flawless block, I sometimes ended up getting no damage or 20 damage, which is a huge difference. The same is true for attacking, rendering the whole reward of actually hitting the timing naught and destroys the satisfaction of playing. Speaking of the non-existence of satisfaction while playing Fearless Fantasy, the cherry on-top of all the previously mentioned frustration is the grinding. As you can see, there are set stages in Fearless Fantasy, with a set amount of waves of enemies that are meant to be defeated. Once a stage was completed, you can proceed to the next level. You will soon hit a point, where a level is unbeatable because your party has not reached a certain experience point yet, thus requiring you to go back and replay previous stages, with the exact same enemy setups, abilities, waves, everything just to grind your way to a higher level. I am aware that grinding is a vital part of a lot of RPG games, especially for the JRPGs Fearless Fantasy is inspired by. The difference to those being though, that in these traditional JRPGs, your party usually went from A to B to complete a certain task, while on the way you had to encounter random monsters, which you then defeated and gained rewards from. The important point here being that you had a target. You were meant to be going someplace and this encounter just stood in your way, however to proceed in your mission, you had to defeat it. In Fearless Fantasy, there is literally no incentive to go anywhere, as the world is split up in levels and thus going back to previous levels just for the mere sake of gaining experience is incredibly tedious and frankly dull.\n\nNow, I did not even mention all the little gripes I have with Fearless Fantasy. For example, the skill system poorly explains what happens after you upgrade an ability, only for you to find out later that due to the latest upgrade and the attached increase in energy cost, you now can only cast a spell once instead of twice, thus ruining the whole plan you had laid out previously.\n\nAll in all, I am honestly sad to see that such a promising idea was wasted with poor execution on all fronts. Low-fidelity aesthetics, horrible writing and voice acting, failures in multiple game design choices and overall a really repetitive experience. If you are interested in the gameplay, do only get Fearless Fantasy at a heavy discount.","October 16, 2014","false","3.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

Every character makes its move an then waits for its cooldown to get ready for action again. You can choose between a melee attack, a ranged attack, some power spells (five per char) which make more or area damage, buff your group etc.) or using items like health potions, mana potions etc. If you cast your spell you have to swipe geometrical figures with the mouse cursor in order to succesfully hit your target or block the attack. And you don't have much time to do so.

Short, silly with casual approach to an RPG elements, very simple story and exciting fighting mechanic.\nIt was the first game that introduced me into this kind of gameplay and I must say - I loved it! Turn based fights where you do not only click on enemy to attack, but the better you do in an mini-game during your/enemy's attack - the more/less damage you deal/recieve. I found it really rewarding and it kept me focused all of the time.\n\nDo not buy it for complex story, because it doesn't offer one - it just fills the basic need for it. As for the RPG part - I also do not recommend it for hardcore fans of the genre who love to fiddle with their characters' stats, abilities and equipment. You can always reset and change everything between fights with no additional in-game cost, which in my opinion is good for this kind of game.\n\nGame offers choice of difficulty for each battle, which makes it good for anyone to pick up and play. You can really feel the difference between each one and it's even more challenging with a mouse.\n\nIf you have a choice - get and play it on a touch device, especially if you are going to play on hardest difficulty.","October 7, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has 13 different battles, each with multiple waves of enemies and 3 different difficulty levels. You can replay previous levels to improve your rating [which is determined by the difficulty you completed it on].\n\nThe game's battle style is centred around "slicing" and clicking. If you're familiar with fruit ninja, although I hesistate to draw a comparison, you'll know what that means. Attack effectiveness is determined by you accuracy in these actions. While this might make it suited to being played on a tablet device, it in fact works very well just with a mouse. You may need to tweak you sensitivity in windows though, as there is no way to do this in-game. This doesn't get boring and remains challenging as each enemy has different attack patterns you need to match, and the sensitivity to sucess goes up as you change difficulty level.\n\nThe graphics in this game are very nice, colourful and detailed. Much like any jrpg, you will encounter lots of bizzarre enemies, which is always a plus with this type of game. The story of the game is told through speech bubbles an dcutscenes, but the quality of the cutscenes is pretty questionable. It's not a major detrement to the game though. The music in this game, matching the graphics, is top-quality.\n","September 13, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not really a deep story (small twist: you fight alongside the princess you're trying to save), but generally fun over all. Music is very good, often with a good beat that works well for combat. Voice acting is excellent- characters are all fun loving or light hearted, without being too over the top. Art is the real draw here- it reminds me of the style seen in "The Yellow Submarine", with maybe a hint of Alice in Wonderland. The Blue Meany would fit right in there! Worth noting that the hit detection is fairly good, although there's some occasional bugginess in some attacks (one boss monster had an attack where their dodge arrows disappear prematurely at a certain step).\n\nOnly downside that stuck out to me is how long the fights can go on for. There's a point where, while you won't really lose to the enemy, they take forever and a day to kill, dragging otherwise fun fights into monotony. There's also a significant difficult ramp up from Casual to Normal mode, but you don't really need to play the higher difficulties unless you're showing off. I will say you probably shouldn't be sleepy when playing this game- your reflexes define just about everything.\n\nI feel there's a lot more good than serious detractions to Fearless Fantasy and I heartily recommend it.","September 13, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/282100/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYhPCc607uw\n\nI love weird games in any kind of sense and Fearless Fantasy is such. The creatures are not typical, the battle system is not entirly typical. At first glance, it seems like another mobile port and to some degree it is, but make no mistake – it's defenently worth your time and money.\n\nThe main character here is Leon, the best bounty hunter in the world. He's tricked by princess Alice to save her from arrange marriage and they start a quest to stop an evil king. Along their journey, the company is joined by Vonn, friend and fellow bounty hunter of Leon, to help them with their quest. Together they have to stop the bad guy and kill a terrifying monster. The story is cheesy, simple and there in nothing to remember, except the character interaction. The writing is surprisingly fun. Cheesy, but fun. Dialogs between everyone is good. It won't win any awards, but I didn't want to skip any of the cutscene.\n\nThe option are bare-bones. Sound sliders, fullscreen, dynamic camera and visual effects. There are non rebindle key, because it's entirly mouse driven game.\n\nThe developer put a little twist on the traditional JRPG's battle system for the player to be more involved. You choose a regular attack or special. Then arrows and/or circles appear on screen and with the mouse you have to slide and/or click on them at precise moment. Better you do, more damage you make. Different skill have different patterns. Some even takes quite a few seconds to do and this keeps you on edge. This is the case with the enemies. When they make a move, you will do the same thing. Better you do, less damage you take and later in the game, this may be the difference between life or death. All skill require energy. Sometimes character can be blinded, but you can still make a flawless move. I really like this battle system. It's not just click to choose, it involves you and it's awesome! But it can also make you rage-quit, if you mess up.\n\nAll enemies have description and from here comes the strategy part. Some enemies while they are alive, his allies receive less damage from range attack, but when they are left alone, they die and so on. So you have to decide to kill the other creatures first or the single one that provide this buff. And this is kinda cool.\n\nThe skill are acquired by leveling up. When this happens, you have one point to put in stats and one in skills. All skills can be level up 5 times. Their sound and especially visual design is great.\n\nAfter a battle you will get gold. With him you can buy weapons, items and gadgets. All are pretty standard. You have to be at certain level to get better weapons, items and gadgets. I wish there were more things to buy.\n\nBeside the battle system, the graphics and charatcer design is what caught my eye at first. Both are amazing!!! All creatures are non standard and I can't even describe them. A mushroom with a some sort of shotgun and an evil flower. This is the best I can do. They are really weird in a good way. A lot of thought is put in them. The backgrounds are great too. They have this oil painting style and I like it. It's different than the characters. The bosses are really fun to fight. All have some sort of support, like tentacles or other characters, that have some buffs and you have to decide from who to start. They require some strategy.\n\nAs for the level design, there isn't much to say. You have a static map and there appear the next level. You click on it, choose the difficulty, represented as stars, fight 3-5 wave of enemies and that's it.\n\nThe suprise for me is the soundtrack. It's great!!! I want to listen it every day. It's that good. All tracks are fast-paced techno and really fits the combat on screen. Sadly, you can't buy it or find it anywhere.\n\nSound effects are great. All have enough punch to feel satisfying and when you combine  it with visual effects, they get even better.\n\nThe voice acting is really nice and I wasn't expecting any. I like Leon, he's bold, cocky, looking for a fight and he always have something to say. Vonn and Alice have their different personality. Non of them three characters are original or complex, but their conversations are fun to watch.\n\nI have few problems with the game. The first and most important is the lack of any information about the debuffs you get. Some you can recognize, like poisoning, but others you can't, at least in the beginning. All have icons beside of characters name and with time you will know them, but I think it would be better if I hover the mouse over them to show me some information. The second is grinding. It isn't much, but had to repeat few level to get some money for new gear. Next is minor. When enemy is about to attack on screen you see “Tap when ready”. Come on, it's a PC game remove tap and put click. Next is audio in cutscenes. It feels really compressed. Other conversations have much better quality. And lastly the combat. I can't comment the mobile version, but the games feels kinda clunky when you have to use the mouse to execute the moves. Further into the game they become longer and complicated. It feels more natural to swipe with fingers. Despite that it's really fun. Oh, and tutorial for the combat is nowhere to be found.\n\nOverall I had fun with the game. It's defenently worth the asking price. If it was more, I would say wait for a sale. The game is not super long. It will take you 3-5 hours to beat it. There is three star rating system and from here come some replayability. I didn't maximise all my skill and I still beat the game, so for me it's not worth on the hardest difficulty, because the fighting become faster and this can make me break my mouse. The battle system, creature design and soundtrack are really great and because of them you can overlook the shortcomings. I recommend it.","January 10","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camelfun/recommended/282100/","camelfun","Mango Mango","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camelfun/","842 products in account","This is Fearless Fantasy—a JRPG inspired indie game with a very unique twist on the standard turn based combat system. This game is an absolute delight! With a great soundtrack, peculiarly nice voice acting, and a fantastic slew of enemies, Fearless Fantasy should be in everyone’s Steam library.\n\nLet me start by acknowledging the work these developers have put into this game. The duo, Enter Skies are still working on this game, as there is a mobile port on the way. And despite being released in May of this year, they still communicate with their community over on the Steam forums (much better than, say, Code Avarice have been doing for the entirety of Paranautical Activity’s existence on the platform).\n\nThe overworld is quite reminiscent of Record of Agarest War, if I’m remembering correctly. You’ve got your difficulty options going in, which will require you be precise with the aforementioned combat system. Bosses, however, have other little stipulations which may further cause you difficulty in Veteran battles. The world is absolutely psychedelic, with beautiful battlefields and some damn trippy enemies.\n\nThe combat incorporates the use of an Elite Beat Agents or Osu! Style of board which will determine whether you miss or critically harm your enemy, or fail to or critically defend against him. Epics and Flawlesses will provide you with powerful turns, while misses will result in failure. You can attempt to troll the enemy, or be trolled yourself—that’s all up to you ;). And consumables are actually useful. Well, I don’t mean to say they aren’t useless in other games, but I can’t tell you how many JRPGs I’ve played where I hoarded the hell out of potions thinking they’d be useful later on, only to end up beating the game with a sack full of vials.\n\nWith general gameplay out of the way, I’ve got to say I was absolutely charmed by this game. The cut scenes are what look to be flash animated, simple, and delightful to watch, with some decent writing and great voice acting. The voice acting is reminiscent of the Tales games to me, and the actors definitely put in a lot of effort despite this seemingly small project. Seriously, the voice acting is absolutely genuine and high quality, especially considering the quirky, humorous nature of the game!\n\nThe last thing I’ll cover is the music and sound. The opening theme was the hook which made me stop what I was watching on the other monitor, amp up the volume, and really give this game my full attention. I may be overly optimistic but everything that’s been done in this game is far from lazy, which includes the use of sound. Attacks seem powerful, and Flawlesses feel amazing when you pull them off!\n\nThis game is an absolute trip. It’s a wonderful, if short adventure. There is a very positive feel and flow to this psychedelic world, in which your progress actually means something. I had a really great time with it, and at the very cheap price point of 7.79 CAD, Fearless Fantasy is definitely a worthwhile purchase.","December 27, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With most indie games, if you play them for more than a half hour you can get the point of them. This game is no exception. However, that doesn't mean it's bad at all. Actually, this one's pretty cool.\n\nGame Mechanics\n\nWas this a mobile game before it was a PC game, was it simultaneously released, or was it purely a PC title? The mechanics and battle system scream mobile, but I haven't bothered to do the research on whether or not this is the case. Either way, it grows old really fast. The problem with these mechanics is that they're all too samey, in comparison with other games. You upgrade, you swipe, you move awkwardly, yadayadayada. All of that is very, very mediocre.\n\nVoice Acting\n\nCornball voice acting. I mean really, really corny. Not bad! The audio is crisp and the voices are fairly punchy - they at least sprung for voice actors or a studio when they recorded this that featured a familiarity with the fabled pop filter so they don't sound like garbage. They also invested in what I assume was audio mastering, since everything has the same sonic presentation.\n\nMusic\n\nGood, but if I can't get a DLC for the soundtrack for free, I'm not gonna spend money on it.\n\nGraphics/Art\n\nThe absolute best part of this game. The graphics, even if designed for a mobile platform, are offbeat. How can I best describe it? Between the deviantart-style anime storyline reveals, the combat graphics, which look absolutely fantastic, and all the other odds and ends -- you can see a clear direction and cohesion for the entire game. This genuinely looks like a group of people got together that wanted to make this specific game.\n\nIt's weird enough to pull everything together and make it interesting, and I absolutely can't complain about that. Quite obviously, some of the graphics were inspired by those used in Final Fantasy games, but they retain their own unique charm and make everything for the game stand out. Get a group of people, make a game, everybody has their place or their purpose, and they tie it all together.\n\nThis is the interesting local band of really good indie games.\n\nAbsolutely recommended for the art style alone, not that anything else is bad.\n\nArt: 9/10 Everything else 7/10","November 30, 2015","true","10.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

I purchased it when it was released back in 2014, and really enjoyed the game. Now, almost two years later, after the developers have overhauled the game and updated it drastically while still keeping the core mechanics intact, it still captivates me, perhaps even more so now.\n\nI don't want to spoil the story, but the art design, character design, voice acting and game mechanics are all very well done for such a lesser known title. Whether you play this on a touch screen laptop, or with a mouse, you're likely to never get tired of the combat (which is primarily what the game is based around) as it's something that is easy to learn, but difficult to master.\n\nIf you enjoy RPG's, unique art styles, fun combat mechanics, great voice acting, humorously cliched (but not in a bad way) character design, than you NEED TO GET THIS GAME.

Thankfully this isn't yet more RPG Maker garbage endlessly ♥♥♥♥ out of the Greenlight colon(y) but a quirky game that plays on cliches in a predictable but enjoyable manner.\n\nThe combat is engaging with both basic attacks and techniques/spells requiring the player to draw through an arrangement of arrows at precise times: missing results in extremely lowered damage while hitting all/mostly perfects will grant further, sometimes esssential bonuses. It often straddles a line between fun and frustrating but overall it works well, Levelling up grants you both attribute and skill points which are pretty straight forward, adding more points onto a skill will typically unlock more hits or damage and often more arrows to complicate matters.\n\nThe story is a typical save the princess and then beat up the bad guy fare but the characters are a little more aware of their situation and are either hammed up or cynical/realistic. They never quite break the 4th wall and there's nothing revolutionary about them and their motives but it's refreshing.\n\nDespite being a three hour game it does feel like it can wear away at your patience towards the end once the QTE sequences get quite long and enemy HP balloons along with them gaining a plethora of obnoxious passive abilities (e.g. 50% less ranged or melee damage, slapping your party with a status effect or damage on death etc.). All things considered it is a neat little game and worth picking up for a couple of bucks or in a bundle.","April 20, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Main problem being that it's a mobile game ported straight to PC, so if you're trying to play this game on the hardest difficulty it gets pretty damn infuriating when the game expects you to have your fingers on 5 different spots of the screen when you're using a mouse. Second problem is that when you upgrade your weapons, it becomes harder to pull off an "epic" attack, which often you need to do to even do damage. For the 2 dudes, this isn't a problem, but for the ♥♥♥♥♥, upgrading your bow to the 3rd tier is a downgrade because of this since it's often impossible to hit all of the spots that pop up on the screen. Third super minor problem, there's not enough of the main villain in the game (he's very Joker'ish) and you don't even get to kill his whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ lackey whom you fight 3 times (or 4, I don't friggin' remember) in the game.\n\nAnyways, the game is all right, voice acting isn't painful, the animated cut scenes are spiffy and there's 1 or 2 laughs to be had. Playing through this game on the hard mode took me 8 hours, playing through on normal mode could probably take you as little as 2 hours to do. I got this game out of a bundle, wouldn't recommend spending actual dollars on it (especially not for the retail price of $6.99), and if you have the option of playing it on your mobile/tablet, definitely do that instead.","January 20","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeah it's a different time based mechanic, that will take a little to get used to. When you do get it down, it is very rewarding, and satisfying to pull off.\n\nIn terms of the game itself here is some things to consider:\n-Game is fairly short (can be finished in about 3 hours)\n-Voice acting! (and not terrible at all)\n-Charming comedic charm\n-Balanced mechanics, that have good synergies between one another.\n-Absolutely fun.\n\nIf you like RPGs or have never tried one and would like an introduction to turn based RPGs I would recommend this title, as it is fairly simple, short, and interesting.\n:D","May 24","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Getting in that force of habit with usual turn based games, you do your stuff and kinda space off, gets me EVERY TIME. If you play games like this regularly or know ways to take advantage of beta games and such being a tester myself as well it's not TOO difficult.

At first I was happily surprised at the system and I enjoyed it, but as I got further I ended up being rather frustrated with it. Perhaps it's all the more so because I am using a laptop the combat with a touchpad mouse is unfortunately quite a pain.\n\nStill, it is a nice game so if you are into RPGs it's definitely worth checking out, mainly because it's a rather amusing parody towards RPGs.","November 19, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style makes me feel like I am watching a stop motion animated Tim Burton movie, with its weird art style I really enjoyed playing it. The voice acting is actually pretty good and I enjoyed the funny humor that the game provides and I like the battle system, waiting for the exact moment to strike as well as following a specific pattern.\n\nHowever, I was put off a bit by this game. It made me feel like I was playing a mobile game, the world map makes me feel like I am in a world map on a mobile device, the combat/battle system works like you are on a mobile device and the quality looks like it has been ported from a mobile device.\n\nThe sound and cutscene (video) quality put me off greatly, sometimes the sound quality sounded good other times it sounds like they recorded the voices with a cheap audio making software, plus, the cutscenes look like they downloaded them from YouTube.\n\nAnother thing which put me off is the limited amount of options it gives you in the options menu. It feels like it has been ported from a mobile device.\n\nBut, setting aside all these problems, this RPG game is a creepy, weird yet funny game to play.\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","May 9, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I have a wireless mouse that I use with my laptop.\n\nSo what I'm getting to is: if you don't have neither a touch screen, nor a [wireless] mouse for your gaming experience - this game would be highly difficult to even try to play. For instance, if you were to try and use the laptop's built in mouse system, it would become increasingly hard to actually manage to complete a single level given that there are patterns that you need to trail with your mouse, and with the built-in mouse, moving quickly enough for that would just be impossible.\n\nTL;DR: TOUCH SCREEN, OR MOUSE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR GAMEPLAY.\n\nI always like the function of upgrading weapons and leveling up, it's so addicting in that sense.\n\nWhenever you upgrade your weapon, an extra mouse/touch pattern will be added whenever you use your skills. When you upgrade your skills, eventually this will add extra requirements when clicking and trailing the little symbols that appear.\n\nAs many people have mentioned before, this game mechanic is very similar to the game many of us know as Osu! Like Osu, it would be much more practical if it were to be played using a touch screen, but given that I do not have one, it is a bit challenging. HOWEVER, this game can be played with a mouse, and you will still be good to go.\n\nI've been playing the game now for an hour or so, and I'm quite addicted. I had to step away in order to prevent playing too much to the point where my family will be screaming at me to get out of my room!\n\nSome of the levels were quite challenging, and I had to die a few times in order to finally beat certain challenging levels, but hey - what fun would a super easy breezy game be?\n\nBottom line: I think you should invest in this game given that the following conditions are met as mentioned above.","January 7","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
