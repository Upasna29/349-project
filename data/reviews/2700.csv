Yes there are people out there who love to just line up all the peeps into the main area, and just blast them to smitherines. This is fun yes, but this is the playstyle that would lead to reviews of "not having any replay-ability". This is just based on how that person played the game, ignore it, and move on. If you have patience, and a good creativity, make a campain world, and you can prosper. There is sandbox (even for those that are creative it is an amazing outlet) which is like any game's creative mode, allowing infinite building. This has been one of my top five games for most of my life, and will most likely remain there.\nGraphics 7/10- While the look of most things is amazing, closer up you can almost taste 2006, but that aside the gameplay it-self is amazing (I personally have not looked into it, but I'm quite sure someone out there made a texture pack or twenty)\nGameplay 10/10- It allows many stories to be played, and can take quite a while (My current time from steam is flawed, I actually have had this game since 2009, and have logged at least 200 hours)\nReplayability 9/10- as I said, the game is indeed boring for those without patience or creativity, and I tend to lack in patience, this is my own personal opinion (From any official opinion, I would easily give it a 10/10)\nOverall 9.5/10 Amazing game, and a texture pack would put the icing on the cake\n\n*Note*\nFor those of you that are the crash and burn kinda people, just letting you know, the peeps are indestructable, believe me I tried VERY hard (Crushing, drowning, melting, more crushing, smashing, throwing, dropping, etc.)\n\nAll in all I hope that based on your personal experiences with you own past gaming, you can enjoy this game as well.

You are put in charge of a your own theme parks which you must expand to bring more customers and money to them.\n\nPros: You have a large variety of rollercoasters, rides, kiosks and themed decorations to lay, often more than you'll be able to cram in a single map. You manage the finance by determining costs for rides, food and souvenirs, balancing against running costs, staff wages other expenses including research which allow you to access even more rides and objects for your park. You start your career with a short selection of maps and a few pre-made rollercoaster designs, and unlock more as you achieve goals in each locations. The Soaked! and Wild! expansions adds even more locations, rides and stalls, you can play the same map over and over yet build different parks every time! Many rides allow themed-customization as well, from color scheme to cart-style or train-length. Micromanagement can also be as deep as you want it: you can go as far as choosing how much pickles a specific burger stand puts in its 1/4-pounder, or don't bother with it, it's up to you.\n\nCons: The graphics are bad when zoomed in, from character designs to fixed-shadows under moving objects, graphical glitches including bad character animations or placement on rides. You can barely hear the music from your rides unless you're zoomed in almost all the way. Building rides has flaws, too: buying a pre-made rollercoaster design never explains why a location wouldn't work or what can be done to the landscape to make it fit, while other times the entire ride will get elevated multiple stories due to a single tile that's 1 pixel higher than the others. As the first game of the series to drop the genre's usual fix-isometric view for a 3D-engline, the camera controls can be extremely clunky, while the vertical angle resets every time you're trying to change it.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nIf you like tycoon games, you're likely to enjoy this one. I could write a review 10 times as long and still have more to say about this game, so in a nutshell: perfect example of a tycoon game done right, with huge variety, good flexibility and excellent replayabiliy. I look forward to the final version of RollerCoaster Tycoon World, the next entry in the franchise!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 21","true","29.2"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","40","43","0","2"

It has something for all gamers, whether you want to be upstuck and businesslike making the pinnicale of rollercoaster cash cows, or mess around and torture the peeps by trapping them all in your park without food, drink, washrooms, or evilest of all.... no sun cream. There's also the inbetween of making some kicking coasters and what not. Now the game is damn old by now, but still shows the care and precision put into the game. but who cares about graphics...\n\n*One overlooked feature is the simplicity of  the savefiles on the computer, so shareing saved coasters and parks is wicked easy, just a matter of dropping the file into the right folder.\n\nover all, buy it, you probably will not regret it. It was worth $20 when released, and in all honesty, hasnt depreciated much. The fact that it is available on steam allows for it to be even easier to play and use, with no need to use the disc, although I have noticed that the load times are somewhat longer without the disc.\n\nPS.

My middle school years were pretty much defined by the original RCT and its expansion packs, which I spent hours on end playing and enjoying. When I first heard of RCT3, I had heard it was cack. Horrible bugs, horrible problems, not fun at all. They fixed some problems with it but it was still not highly regarded.\n\nNow that I have it and have played it, I can say without a doubt that it's relatively fun. It does some very cool new things but also takes away a few things that made the originals fun. Path making is a tiny bit irritating especially trying to make slopes at first, but you get used to it. There are a multitude of new coaster designs and the building tools for those are roughly the same with a new "autocomplete" button that really isn't worth using. Scenarios appear to be absurd and not as interesting as the old RCT scenarios. The sandbox mode is a neat addition (we had to use trainers back in the day to play around with unlimited money!), and there is LOADS of customization that can be done. The fireworks shows are neat and the additional water/safari themes are nice too. CoasterCam is an addition everyone had wanted for the series (although NoLimits lets you import tracks from RCT1/2) and it works well.\n\nUltimately, this game has some minor flaws, but the level of customization and the new features more than make up for it and make it a worthwhile purchase even for long time RCT fans.","December 26, 2013","true","6.2"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Heck, even if you get tired after career mode, the godly sandbox - and other build options too - will keep you playing like as if it's you trying to perfect your own model railway; except for the fact that there will be a phallic-shaped pool.\n\nYet, above all, the game engine is old. I mean it - Nerd³ (a YouTuber I adore) had to stop building his park due to the game just being unstable and slow; even his rig blew the specs for this game out of the water! But then his park was full of crap here and there. It just makes me hope that RCT4 exploits modern hardware for full potential...if Atari even TRIES to make the game good. Okay, quasi-tangent over.\n\nAll in all, RCT3: Platinum's seemingly never-ending torrent of content has kept me going for some time (nearly 60 hours, to be exact), despite showing it's age.

This third installment of the game was made by Atari with the intention to attract all ages and genders, so the game looks slightly childish in my opinion. But make no mistake - this simulation is so rich it would make your head explode.\n\nThe game features an incredible level of depth to the simulation, almost unparallaled. It allows you to control if/how much toppings you put in each beverage sold in one of the dozens of stalls. It includes cheap terrain modification (and spray paint) and many differently themed decorations and buildings. It has a scheduled fireworks simulator with a built in looper (and the cost is per single firework). Each sim in the park has a wallet, a set of hands to hold on to stuff, a set of bars for hunger/thirst/nausea and ride preferences. You will, at some point, be required to address the career ambitions of Animal Keeper 17.\n\nAnd there's the rollercoaster simulator. Many dozens of real rollercoasters where the ride excitement is a factor of the speed, drops, g forces and more. A beatutifully complex and simple interface. I grew up playing the prequels and I was surprised every ride and rollercoaster I knew from the game was a real thing somewhere. RCT2 had missions in Six Flags parks and other famous parks around the world. This one instead has many creative scenarios where you start with a crazy looking old town or a huge garden that show you what this game has to offer if you decide to go sandbox.\n\nWhich is probably the point of this game - it's like building models more than anything.\n\nDownsides are the low difficulty in this installment. If you are completing the missions you don't really need to use the many features of this game. I would give my Peeps a food stall only after three or four months. There's no benefit to tampering with the food and items you sell (the ride control boxes are awesome to tinker with).\n\nBuy it on sale for sure.","January 2, 2015","true","118.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","20","21","4","1"

I used to beat the crap out of the game disc on my first laptop, so you can easily add 80 hours to the playtime.\n\nWell, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is now an aging beast. The game originally released in 2004, and that unfortunally shows. While graphics isn't the main or even secondary reason you would like to play this game, there are some now hard to forgive kinks in that department like the lack of native 1080p support. There are of course workarounds to this, but then again, it's hard to blame a game from before widescreens became common to have widescreen support.\n\nSo, what about the game itself? Well, it's really as solid as you would expect the sequel to RCT2 would be.  While the iconic, isometric pixel art of the first two games have been replaced with 3D, it really looks good for its age. There is content enough in the game to keep you sucked in for a long, long time, plenty of RollerCoaster types and designs to keep you interested and best of all, the people in the park aren't as timid as they were in the first two games, allowing you to build more extreme rides without it having a negative impact on your play.\n\nSo, why would you buy this? Honestly, Nostalgia is the main reason. But it does this very, very well and I still return to it ten years later.","February 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

It's the RCT you know and love only in 3D with rideable rides, loads of new coasters and buildings and in this version the ability to make water parks and zoo's in your park. But is it worth the price of admission?\n\nTL;DR This game has more than enough content to make it worth 20$ with zoo's, water parks, new rides, buildings and 39 scenario's each with 3 levels of challenge and goals. Ride your own rides, build your own peeps, heck there's even mod's for this game. If your thinking about getting this game, BUT IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!\n\nA lot of people will look at this game and it's age... yes it was released in 2006 and is 8 years old, than they look at the price which is a steep 20$ and freak out saying not worth it and to expensive. However those people are wrong and here's why.\n\nYou are paying 20$ for RCT 3 base game which is loaded with features like sandbox mode, coaster, building, and peep designer as well as a massive campaign with 18 scenario's each with a different theme and 3 levels of challenege from beginer all the way to tycoon.\n\nThan the Soaked! pack comes with 9 scenario's with the same 3 level challenge teir and the Wild! back has 12 Scenario's... again with the challeneges.\n\nSoaked and Wild also come with new rides, buildings and attractions like, well a water slides, pools and zoo's but also rides that arn't necessarily linked to a zoo theme. You can also use all that comes with the packs in any mode, so if your playing the base campain you can put in a zoo and pool.\n\ndon't like campaigns?

You can do that in this game.\n\nWant to have a park with a wave of breakdancing entertainers creating crowd blockages on every footpath?

You can make a park based on just that concept in this game.\n\nHey - you can even create the guests in this game.\n\nIf you want to make the entertainment park of your dreams, regardless of what it is - this game is for you, and even your wildest ideas can likely become a reality here. Make a wild safari tour, with a tour vehicle running through all of the exhibits. Make your dream water park with a waterslide modeled after your favorite bendy straw. Make a firework show that goes along to the song "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen.

The expansion which add a tremendous amount of content to the game. RCT3 is at its core, a management game. You build and run a theme park the way you see fit, byt placing rides, attractions, booths, and more, to attract customers, and at the end, collecting their hard earned money to keep the park going, and to pay your employees their hard earned money. Obstacles will come in the form of rides breaking down, unhappy patrons or employees, and more problems to solve. And there are 2 ways to play this game: Full on simulation mode, where money matters, or a full on sandbox mode, where you can pretty much spend as much as you want, and get away with anything. There are as well, fun little scenarios to play to get you used to the games mechanics, which start off as tutorials, and end up being challenges to help you unlock stuff.\n\nFor anyone who has played RCT1 and 2, this game strays from the earlier isometric visuals of the first 2, and comes back with full 3D visuals, which this time around actually let you ride the park rides in 1st person. Everything looks pretty damn gorgeous, except for a few visual hiccups, like when messing with terrain, or the extremely aged and ugly looking patrons. Everything else looks damn fine though for a game this old. The expansions will take your vanilla park, and add a water park features, as well as a wildlife park, complete with various animals to use as attractions for the patrons.\n\nThis title is pretty easy to get into, even for people new to management games. Also a blast to play for veterans.","November 18, 2012","true","47.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I hated it. This is after hundreds (thousands?) of hours combined in RCT1 and 2.\n11 years later I decided to give it another try and picked it up on Steam and gave it a fair shot. I can honestly say that it is a very good game and it does live up to being a RCT. There is so much variety in this game. You can customize each shop to sell what you want. You can build dozens of different thrill rides, roller coasters, gentle rides, etc. The graphics are ageless and will look good no matter what year you play in.\n\nHowever, there are 2 rather large issues that I have a hard time getting over. Hotkeys and the UI. These two areas were perfect in 1 and 2. For whatever reason, RCT3 does not have adequate hotkeys. For example, you can't press a key and open up Finances, rides, guests, staff, etc, like you could in 1+2. You have to move the mouse over to a very small circluar button and click it. To leave that menu, you have to click an (X) button on the menu that is literally only a few pixels wide. In the previous games, you could press Backspace to get out of the menu. Prepare for some precision clicking in this game.\n\nIf the developers just leaved those two things exactly how they were from before, this game would be very close to being perfect. It's so tedious having to click tiny buttons. Here's hoping that RCT:World will be a great game.","January 3","true","17.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You can build food stands and theme your rides and everything is completely customizable from the name of your park, to how much the entery fee is, to if people get to choose how many pickles they get on their burgers at the burger shop you build.

Even the graphics aren't bad.\n\nBeing a fan of rollercoasters and parks, it sure is a game for me.\nThe scenarios are great, but let's be honest, we all play that kind of game for the sandbox. Being able to create your own thing as you wish, without having to care about managing anything.\nAnd in this game, there are really a lot of options. You can create so many things. Especially with both expansion packs included. You can create your park, put whatever you want in it, the rides you wish, make your own rollercoasters, make pools with slides, create buildings, make fireworks shows or even lasers shows, shape landscape, put waterfalls, billboards with personalized images, make a mini-zoo.... So many things. And not only can you create all that stuff, see people in the park enjoying it, get info about it (like speed of rides, g-force, etc), but you can even ride everything (slides, rollercoasters, rides)...\nYou can create your own park the way you wish, and then you can even experience it.\n\nAnd if you forget about the sandbox mode a bit, there's still plenty of time to spend on the scenarios, the rollercoaster builder if you wish to only create a rollercoaster... And also something pretty neat about the game, you can put your own music in the game.\nAlso, there are quite a few mods that you can find and which are pretty great, even though there is no centralized place for that.\n\nUnless you don't like theme parks or rollercoasters or creating stuff, there is no reason not to like this game.\nAll I could see missing to it is better textures and easier modding so we could get a lot of awesome community-created content.","April 20, 2014","true","25.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I grew up playing the RCT games. I was always wanting more from the game and now with RCT 3 I got it.\nThe game is full of color and cool new rides that will make your guest happy.

(For a side note I have alot more time on this game in offline mode on steam then I do on online mode).\nYou have options on how you want to play but for me I always play Sandbox mode.

RC3 has updated graphics, but it would have been amazing to see a more "serious" and "realistic" look rather than the "cartoonish" environment. I do thoroughly enjoy the "on ride" first person camera view, it makes you able to experience your park first hand. The rides overall are pretty cool but again I would have liked to see a more realistic detail. What RC3 did get right was the mechanics. They are terrific, taking ideas from RC2 and making them even better. Budgeting is as fun and challenging as ever, and some scenarios worth exploring. I do enjoy RC3, there is also loads of content available online including fully made parks. I do have a little more love overall for RC1, only due to the originality and extreme customization and modding. I would absolutely love to see another Rollercoaster Tycoon, they are truly fun and addicting.","January 11","true","17.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There is over 35 roller coaster types, spanning a wide range of abilities and themes. My to favorites are the Corkscrew coaster, which allows you to go all twisty-turney all over the park, and the Stratocoaster which is hydraulic-powered and goes extremely fast.\n\nThe new CoasterCam ability allows you to ride your own coasters, which let me tell you is amazingly fun. You get to see your creation unfold in front of your very eyes, and that is very rewarding.\n\nThe game isn't just about roller coasters, there is a plethora of other rides and attractions. You can build pool slides, pools, ferris wheels, free-fall rides and swings, among much other attractions. You also have to manage food and drinks, or your guests (Peeps) will get hungry/thirsty.\n\nYou can individually manage the prices for each individual attraction, giving your park a good balance of money I/O.\n\nCONS:\n\nBad Graphics (Not bad for 2004 though)\nGame gets EXTREMELY laggy if you have a big park.\nBuilding coasters is annoying sometimes as they sometimes fail and you have to re-build the entire thing.\n\n\nBut that's it!\n\n9/10, amazing game!","February 14, 2014","true","25.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, while I fully recommend purchasing this game if  you're a fan of theme parks, don't go in expecting RCT 1 or 2.\n\nThis game has a completely different feel than you may remember from the first couple games. The first game had a charm that was all it's own, and with this third installment it's mostly function over form. That being said, the function is a hell of a thing.\n\nThings you can do in this game that you couldn't do in the first two:\n- ride your rides / explore your parks in a 3D environment\n- build water park / zoo type attractions (complete with their own sets of custom controls)\n- create themed night time shows set to your own music, using fireworks, lasers, and water cannons (i saw someone online creating scenes from Disney's World of Color ... damn.)\n- import custom graphics using billboards and tiles (with some tinkering, if you're using a newer OS.)\n\nAnd since this game has been around for a while, there's also a huge wealth of custom scenery / rides / ride vehiceles / etc. online at your disposal, to help you create literally whatever kind of ride / show / theme park you can think of.\n\nI've played other theme park sims that have come and gone since this one and while, yes, the graphics and are a little dated and, yes, you will need to spend some time grinding through all the tutorials and knocking out the scenarios before you get pro enough for sand box mode, I still maintain that this game is still THE best theme park sim out there to really let your imagination run wild.\n\n(That is, perhaps, until Theme Park Studios is released in 2014.)","December 18, 2010","true","552.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First off by saying buy this game! It's so addicting, fun and just adds to the RCT series in a perfect way. Having owned the Deluxe Edition on disk for a while I put off buying the Platinum Edition on steam but I'd recommend it so much! It's a game I am more than proud to have in my library and, whilst my time on steam isn't currently much, it will be soon!\n\nThis game is wonderful! From the coaster creation to the park management everything is wonderful to manage! Name your park and follow the challenges or, if you're in a creative mood, bust open a sandbox park and build as you wish! Rides need to be a balance of thrills and speed without being too high in G-Force to tune down the chance of nausia and motion sickness for the 'peeps' that inhabit your wonderous land!\n\nAll in all I give this game a 9.5/10, an all time favourite of mine since I got it on disk many years back! 110% recommended!","February 3, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I have over 150 something hours on this baby.\n\nMy first experience with roller coaster simulation games was the game "Thrillville: Off the Rails" for the Wii. There was nothing to do, and there were just limits, limits, limits on that game. It's not Thrillville: It's Dullsville.\nWhen I found out this game was on Steam I just went completely head over heels for it. I've been a fan of the RCT franchise since second grade, and I was itching to play this one. However, I was worried that maybe this game would turn out to be just like Thrillville, with just limits, limits, limits.\nSo I decided to go ahead and give this game a try. I bought it and played Sandbox mode for maybe 20-30 minutes until I really got into the game. I severely injured 78 peeps on a horrific inverted roller coaster, drowned the annoying park inspector 50 times, charged 100 dollars for peeps to TCOB, and let my animals run loose and terrify peeps.\nWhat I really like about this game is that it's the Platinum version. That means it includes all three expansions, so you don't have to waste more money on downloadable expansions. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a hardcore roller coaster fan.\n\nI'd rate this 9/10, and the reason why it's a 9 is because it's the graphics. The rest? PURE AWESOME!","January 11, 2015","true","162.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

You'll notice the thousands of things they needed to include before ending the franchise. Worth every penny in my opinion though. I'm a sucker for theme parks and roller coasters. It just gets a little tiring hearing the same sounds and running into all the things that I can't do that should exist. This on top of some stupid bugs and ugly physics can leave you questioning the purpose of some features including in the title.\n\nThe primary issue with RCT3 is that it's outdated, yet still being pushed and played by the community because there hasn't been a game like it since it came out, so we're left with what we've got. If you're REALLY good at working with this title, you can modify it and submit your creations online to share and upload into the game, which is cool, but very tedious.\n\nOverall, it's really fun game to expand your creativity, but if you're looking to create Disney/Universal quality attractions, it's not happening here. Theme Parks simply weren't what they are now back in 2004. You're getting what's advertised, but just be aware that you'll find yourself wanting so much more out of something with infinite potential. I just really wish there was money in rebooting the franchise to give us a fresh addtion. A new engine with realistic sounds and lifelike visuals sounds better than food... (joking)\n\nThere is a title is the works from a seperate company called Theme Park Studio, but it has yet to be released and may be a little too complex for the average consumer like myself. It has great potential and could become the closest thing we will get to another RCT. Cheers!","February 28, 2011","true","82.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll notice the thousands of things they needed to include before ending the franchise. Worth every penny in my opinion though. I'm a sucker for theme parks and roller coasters. It just gets a little tiring hearing the same sounds and running into all the things that I can't do that should exist. This on top of some stupid bugs and ugly physics can leave you questioning the purpose of some features including in the title.\n\nThe primary issue with RCT3 is that it's outdated, yet still being pushed and played by the community because there hasn't been a game like it since it came out, so we're left with what we've got. If you're REALLY good at working with this title, you can modify it and submit your creations online to share and upload into the game, which is cool, but very tedious.\n\nOverall, it's really fun game to expand your creativity, but if you're looking to create Disney/Universal quality attractions, it's not happening here. Theme Parks simply weren't what they are now back in 2004. You're getting what's advertised, but just be aware that you'll find yourself wanting so much more out of something with infinite potential. I just really wish there was money in rebooting the franchise to give us a fresh addtion. A new engine with realistic sounds and lifelike visuals sounds better than food... (joking)\n\nThere is a title is the works from a seperate company called Theme Park Studio, but it has yet to be released and may be a little too complex for the average consumer like myself. It has great potential and could become the closest thing we will get to another RCT. Cheers!","February 28, 2011","true","82.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For it's time the game look's great..\n2. You can build lot's of coaster's..\n3. There is more then just coaster's.. Such as Food and drink stalls and carnival ride's..\n4. There is lot's of themes you can add to your theme park..\n5. There is some really cool cheat code's..\n6. There is just so much in this game.. Pool's and animals and firework show's\n7. There is a sandbox mode also (My favorite mode)\n\nNow let's get to the con's.. :(\n\n1. The ai in this game is so stupid.. For example, I have a baby coaster at the entrance of my park.. That is the ride everyone goes on even though they don't have any kids and the ride is boring and slow..\n2. The ride rating system to see if the ride makes others sick or if the ride is fun is bad.. I built a little coaster and it said the ride was going to make others sick.. Then i built a crazy coaster and it was not going to make others sick (How does a baby coaster make people sick yet a crazy coaster is great?)\n\nNow would i say go out and buy this game?\n\nYes.. i would even though those issues are there.. This game is one of my favorite games to date..\n\n9/10\n\n","March 28","true","30.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's totally worth it!\nThis game does show its age because the graphics aren't extremely pretty, and if you look at the peeps ingame, you're basically looking at low-poly models of clay animation abominations. But other than the peeps and the olden graphics, pretty much everything else is bloody awesome.\n\nThis is basically a game where you manage an amusement park. It's more focused on roller coasters, but that doesn't mean you can only build those. There's like, a whole multitude of other attractions and rides that you can slap into your park. Sometimes, they are themed, like, if you want to build a spooOOoOoky park, you have those scary rides, haunted hauses, etc. The roller coasters? Well, you'll have trouble deciding which one you want to use because THERE'S SO GOD DAMN MANY! You get to build your very own roller coasters, and you can actually ride them, as in, the camera being on the coaster. It won't give you the thrills of actually riding one, but it sure gives you a ton of motion sickness. Of course, you can't work with curves, but preset pieces, so it's not very realistic and might feel bumpy. You can still make a good coaster that way. Fun.\n\nManaging the park is sometimes a challenge, people barf so you have to have janitors. Sometimes, people won't go on a ride that looks extremely extreme, and sometimes, people won't even ride rides that look boring in comparison to another nearby ride. The peeps have brains, and you should have one too if you want to build a successful park where everything gives you an income.\n\nOh, and if you don't care about building a park to give you income, you can always make a murderland where you run over peeps by a derailed metal coaster car that launch at 88 miles per hour and send them peeps back to the future. Can't say I haven't done that myself.\n\nIt's old, but it's a really good and classic game. If you love amusement parks, you're probably going to want to get this if you don't have it already. It's really fun. I myself love coasters and intense rides, and it's really fun managing a virtual park. The game is both fun as it is, and as a coaster murder simulator.

It's totally worth it!\nThis game does show its age because the graphics aren't extremely pretty, and if you look at the peeps ingame, you're basically looking at low-poly models of clay animation abominations. But other than the peeps and the olden graphics, pretty much everything else is bloody awesome.\n\nThis is basically a game where you manage an amusement park. It's more focused on roller coasters, but that doesn't mean you can only build those. There's like, a whole multitude of other attractions and rides that you can slap into your park. Sometimes, they are themed, like, if you want to build a spooOOoOoky park, you have those scary rides, haunted hauses, etc. The roller coasters? Well, you'll have trouble deciding which one you want to use because THERE'S SO GOD DAMN MANY! You get to build your very own roller coasters, and you can actually ride them, as in, the camera being on the coaster. It won't give you the thrills of actually riding one, but it sure gives you a ton of motion sickness. Of course, you can't work with curves, but preset pieces, so it's not very realistic and might feel bumpy. You can still make a good coaster that way. Fun.\n\nManaging the park is sometimes a challenge, people barf so you have to have janitors. Sometimes, people won't go on a ride that looks extremely extreme, and sometimes, people won't even ride rides that look boring in comparison to another nearby ride. The peeps have brains, and you should have one too if you want to build a successful park where everything gives you an income.\n\nOh, and if you don't care about building a park to give you income, you can always make a murderland where you run over peeps by a derailed metal coaster car that launch at 88 miles per hour and send them peeps back to the future. Can't say I haven't done that myself.\n\nIt's old, but it's a really good and classic game. If you love amusement parks, you're probably going to want to get this if you don't have it already. It's really fun. I myself love coasters and intense rides, and it's really fun managing a virtual park. The game is both fun as it is, and as a coaster murder simulator. It's up to you to decide how you play it.","January 15","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Another 300 were hovering around the sun lotion stand. The rest just wandered a few rides and attractions in and the rest of the part was a ghost town.\nEither this shows how badly designed SiX Flags America is (which I do have issues with) or how broken the simulation is.

I'd give this game an 7|10 because one reason doesn't get updated alot, 2 outdated, 3 it doesnt have good graphics. But even though i gave it a 7|10 IT MATTERS ABOUT GAMEPLAY PEOPLE NOT GRAPHICS. I haven't seen any bugs or glitches but I bet there's a few. Anyways this game is fantastic","October 25, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kastrenzo/recommended/2700/","kastrenzo","Kastrenzo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kastrenzo/","325 products in account","I bought this game after the release of RTC:World right in the middle of the RCT vs Planet Coaster drama battle.\n\nThe original RCT and RCT2 were essentially part of my childhood, and I saw that many of the people talking about PlanetCoaster had praised the developer  "Frontier" as they were responsible for RCT3\n\nI figured since I was not interested in RCT:W, and that I was planning on getting Planet Coaster when it releases, that I owed it to myself to give 3 a try. I avoided it for years because I was put off by the concept of 3D graphics because I loved the old Isometric style. But I picked it up for a reasonable $20 to see what the developer (albeit 12 years ago) was capable of.\n\nIt wasn't as bad as I thought,  overall there's a huge variety of rides, and the two expansions add the ability to add water park and zoo elements to your game too, Two things that in real life make sense but are completely alien and new to someone who's only played the first two games\n\nSome negative detractors are in order however,\n\nThe UI, it sucks. it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ trying to navigate alll the tiny buttons that pop up on the corners and on the side, and building custom tracks and sidewalks was so much simpler with the old building system. this is probably my biggest complaint.\n\nThe sound quality is good, but there's lots of annoying repetitive sounds. YAY, YAY, YEEHAW, YAY... fml\n\nLastly, the physics of this game are kind of lame,  bumper boats drive right through each other, and rollercoasters dont seem to be very realistic, Junior coasters and Giga coasaters alike, both look like they are gently meandering around the tracks. Maybe there's a mod for this.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable game and I understand why Planet Coaster is called the spiritual successor to RCT3,  I look forward to it.\n\n","April 4","true","14.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And guess what, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum is basically RollerCoaster Tycoon + Zoo Tycoon together, a dream come true! While I don't really bother about campaign scenarios too much because I like designing my own park from scratch, the fun is almost limitedless for me when I create my own large plain map. I can build rollercoasters, swimming pools, even a zoo, and lots more. I can even design what they will look like, their positions and many more. This is the ultimate tycoon game for tycoon game lovers :)\n\nCons though:\n-Terrain smoothing doesn't really work. Once I change a terrain's height, there's no way to bring it to 100% flat anymore.\n-Inserting a large premade rollercoaster lags the game for 2 seconds (probably more for older computers it was designed to run on, since this game is rather old)\n-Map editor is rather clunky and inconvenient. Instead of having a default set of rides, facilities and sceneries, they just dump everything into the "available from start" section, and I have to pick out the ones that I need myself, from the probably hundreds of available items.

I'm not too into top-down strategy games, but there's just something magical about RCT3 that seperates it from the rest. Whether you want to play the campaign and turn a failing enterprise into a wealthy tycoon, or just go in sandbox and make rollercoasters that crash into people, RCT3 is well worth the cash.

Instead, I get scenarios where an entire park is already built for me, and would make more money if I just left it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MWSampson/recommended/2700/","MWSampson","Max","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MWSampson/","122 products in account","Right, so I have been a big fan of the RCT franchise because they are awesome games. A few people in the positives have written that it's great to be able to create a park that's "whatever you want". Don't get me wrong but what I want from RCT3 is the RCT franchise I know and love, except better.\n\nSo the graphics: They are bad. They have dated terribly. (They are old, yes, but they have aged tragically). A few people have said the opposite but look at the pictures with people in and you'll see what I mean. This isn't necessarily an issue, but my problem was that I wanted the plain looking characters from RCT1 and 2.\nThe interface: Again, really not that good. In RCT1/2 the interface was simple. To save you hit the floppy disk. To get rides you hit the helter skelter, to build anything you hit the crane. Well fortunately this system has been replaced with one of excessive numbers of buttons that you will never want to touch. There's no intuitive building system either.\n\nSo now to the details of the game:\nShops/Stalls: Now have an added feature where you can add toppings/details. Neat, huh? You can decide whether customers get cheese on the burger or not. Whether they have ice in their drink. Ice Cream in their milkshake. Now, that's all well and good except when you're setting the price of the goods it doesn't tell you how much profit per item you will make, which is a pretty important detail. No? And you're not told the costs associated with adding a topping. How useful. I suppose at least they tell you when you're undercharging.\n3D rollercoaster rider: Well this is a neat feature. It's not a bad idea, especially when games like theme park had the feature from the beginning. There is an unfortunate problem though, it's jolty and a bit of an anti-climax. It's a neat feature though.\n"Parties" of Guests: Another neat feature in concept but really unnecessary. I always figure that if a tycoon game starts to make its customers more complex in a sequel then you've got problems, but for RCT I thought it might work. After all, when was the last time you went to a theme park by yourself? Unfortunately it doesn't seem to operate under general logic. If someone is going to queue up for one ride for a month then surely you'd go and get some food or walk around the scenery? No, you instead clog paths and complain, "my isn't it busy?"\n"Three difficulty modes": Yeah... Nice try at claiming that. What that actually means is you can pass the level in three different ways. The customers aren't more difficult at a higher level, they don't need better ameneties or better roller coasters. Nope, you actually just get a more time constrained (or higher guest count/park value) with less time. Surely difficulty levels don't work that way?!?!?\n\nI am a massive (read: MASSIVE) fan of the franchise and I'd seriously suggest that if you want to give the game a go you should go and buy either roller coaster tycoon the first, or the second. The game is better. The graphics are /technically/ worse but in sum the game is better.\n\nEDIT: Anyone who is acting like I'm saying game graphics are important you will note I am saying that this gameplay is no better... and the graphics have aged badly. //This is a bad combination//.\nI agree that graphics aren't important, but they are a factor to be considered when buying a game.","December 8, 2013","false","2.3"," 108 of 240 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","108","240","4","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/west_haven/recommended/2700/","west_haven","west_haven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/west_haven/","115 products in account","I was really excited to finally play a RCT game after nearly fourteen years, even more so after the original game disks for RCT2 wouldn't load properly on my computer. However, I became pretty confused at the menus for the game and on how to simply do things in the game.\n\nFor starters, there is NO HOT KEYS programmed into the game. Another review mentions that you can rotate the camera with two keys, and then you can move around the map with the directional keys (or asdw). But that is IT. How they set it up to make the roller coasters themselves would be MUCH easier if you could use the directional keys. I lost count on how many times I had to delete tracks because I accidentally did it wrong because of the cumbersome interface.\n\nLet me say that again: it's confusing to make roller coasters in this game. Considering it's RollerCoaster Tycoon, that isn't a good thing. If your roller coaster happens to go underground, if you delete it, it doesn't undo the large hole in the ground. If you make a roller coaster too tall, it doesn't tell you it's too tall; it just says you can't build there, which causes some confusion as you try to go around it all. Messing with the ground is one of the most frustrating thing ever. Last night, I was able to make a pretty cool body of water under my roller coaster. Hours later, I decided to make a ferry in that lake to get to the other side. For some reason, I then couldn't edit the ground that I had edited earlier to make that lake; I actually could not make a deeper lake for my ferry to really go by. Then I had loads of trouble making paths that actually lined up with the buildings and rides. For at least an hour, I didn't realize that people couldn't go to the shops I made because the path "didn't line up" with it. People got stuck on pathways around there, so I had to tinker around with the path for at least thirty minutes just to get it right.\n\nThe menus are just terrible here. Constantly I just pressed around until I got what I wanted. And with no hot keys, it made the process even more tedious than it should have been.\n\nSo bottom line: I am playing this game, and I will be playing it more. But I am really disappointed in the controls and interface. I only played it on sandbox, where I have unlimited money; I can't imaging playing it and actually trying to make a profit. It was cool making that one roller coaster and "riding" it, and of course it's always fun to make that death roller coaster and watching people scatter and fall out of it. But I can't see me actually trying to make a successful park out of this. I'd rather try to get RCT2 working again.","February 2, 2014","false","6.4"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","7","27","0","1"

At first glance, it's pretty, nicely updated, a great step forward.  The sheer amount of stuff you could build was impressive and lord the options.  There was so many gentle rides and a plethora of restaurants to choose from, you could almost build a full park from their options alone.\n\nThe water rides got a nice increase, with way more choices and little things like fireworks, scenery options, and zoo attractions where nice and should have been included way earlier than this (Like in the first game).\n\nThen I got into the game play of actually building a park and rides and discovered just how much I truly hated this version of the game.  I found the controls to be extremely frustrating, which in the end, left me uninstalling it and going back to the original where I apparently belong.\n\nA makeover in graphics and more options doesn't make a better game.

I played Sim Theme Park when I was younger and had a blast with it and I hoped that RollerCoaster Tycoon would fill that void.  I was wrong.  While this game boasts some serious depth with regards to how many different types of rollercoasters, rides, and scenery you can build, those items seem irrelevant while playing (they are just for you, the AI doesn't notice it too much) and don't make up for the game's basic functionality shortcomings.\n\nThe first problem I experienced was building a rollercoaster is a serious time investment.  While that is fun at first, I spent a very long time just trying to complete the circuit, which is arguably the least fun part of building a coaster.  Then I had to create the entrance and exit and found myself spending more time creating a working queue that fit with my coaster design yet still didn't attract enough riders to fill it even a quarter of the way up.\n\nMy trouble really stems from the user interface for RollerCoaster Tycoon.  All the buttons are quite cryptic (just tiny icons that you have to memorize.  For example, the guest list icon has a wrench on it, which is easily confused with the staff icon, which also has a wrench on it) and I was unable to easily find hotkeys for basic tasks such as deletion, which is a two click operation each time.  The escape key, which in most games just exits the last or top-most open menu, always prompts you whether to leave your current game.  It is as if the interface designers hadn't ever played other games and made their own independent system, putting the responsibility on the user to learn how to play.\n\nThe other half of my issues comes from excessive depth in construction.  As I said before, I must have spent an hour creating a path because I wasn't allowed to build it under certain segments of my coaster, while I could under other segments.  I do accept some blame for not thinking through my design, but I came from the Sim Theme Park universe, where I could have fun creating a rollercoaster and would spend more time making money from it than from building the entrances and exits.  This problem extends to shops and kiosks where if you don't toggle the "auto-levelling" feature (which should arguably be toggled on by default), even if it is up against a path, the ignorant AI can't get to the food or items.\n\nOverall, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a headache with its strange interface and picky construction rules.  I had some fun with it, but my last game was so annoying that I had to write this review.  Sim Theme Park was a great example of a fun and deep theme park game.  Yes, it was a bit cartoony and maybe even a little childish, but the interface and construction guidance allowed for some serious creativity and challenging gameplay.  Rather than frustration over how to finish your coaster and get the entrance sorted out, SimTheme Park allowed you to focus on goals of each mission.","June 3, 2015","false","10.5"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","1","14","0","0"

Everything in this game felt soulless and even hostile at times. I can only visualize the developers of this game as some sort of corporate zombies, tasked to emulate Roller Coaster Tycoon using New Three D Technology(tm). No thought was put into this game. nothing new. nothing original. nobody asking, "What's the best way to implement this feature that would be the most pleasing/ interesting/ convenient for the user?"\nThe UI was the first sign that something was horribly wrong. Almost all of the menus are on the lefthand side of the screen in a long unlabled column of vague icons which, when clicked, open up another long unlabeled column of icons. I'm sure with a little effort, I could memorize what each of the icons does, but why bother? Nothing in this game is thought out or intuitive. There's no sensible organization to the list of icons. Maybe I'll try to get around it by using hot keys? "HAHA! WHAT ARE HOTKEYS? THIS IS THE FUTURE, HERE IN THE FUTURE THERE IS ONLY ONE BUTTON AND A POINTY TRIANGLE." Really. All I can do with my keyboard is rotate the camera, Q and E. Two buttons.\nNeed to toggle on/off trees so I can see where I'm building my path? Lefthand column. Video controls. Toggle scenery off.... Wait... That toggles everything off? Even raised paths and rides? And they're totally invisible now? Not even a shadow to see what I'm connecting to? I just wanted to turn off trees!\nBut wait! there's a third key on the keyboard that woks! It's escape! No matter where you are in the game, pressing escape will bring up a box asking if you want to quit. The yes button is higlighted. The game knows. It begs to be put to rest, and forgotten into the oblivion of time.

I never was able to build a coaster that actually worked. Any slight incline, despite a powered launch and every attempt aiding the cart to be able to go up, caused the damn thing to roll backwards. I could not figure out how to connect the exit of Crazy Golf to a path. Once you try to change the surrface terrain and you screw up, fixing your mistake can be impossible to figure out. So do I recommend this game? Not really.

Me too, then I got the gamer's high and figured I'd try this old horse out again with all the shiny updates, new cover and a number "3" instead of a number "2" at the end of the title.\nWhat a waste of money.\nIt's just as laggy and mindless as I remember, which some people like, I grant you, but I am not one of those types. This is an excellent game for a child under the age of 14 who is just breaking into a real gaming PC, but maybe FPSs or RTSs are too complicated; or the machine you're using is so out-dated that this is the only game you can play. Honestly, I see no real changes to this edition when I put it aside RCT 2. The graphics are nicer and more smooth, but all the employees, rides, options and flavour is the exact same. Sure the "story" mode has different maps and settings, but at the end of the day you're just running another crappy amusment park, advertising in the same venues, and figuring out the best way to rip off faceless droves of NPCs just enough that you gouge them without turning them away. It's a micro-manager's wet dream much in the same way that EVE is, but very much without the rewarding sense of accomplishment or space lasers.","October 9, 2014","false","31.0"," 4 of 22 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","4","22","0","0"

Then buy this awesome game (or the 1/2 game). RCT3 is my personal favorite out of the three, mostly because of its 3D design.\n\nIn this game, you can select different modes such as a campaign type mode were you complete tasks, a sandbox mode were you run a park and get unlimited money, and a few designing modes.\n\nYou can almost litterly make any roller coaster you can imagine (as long as it follows real physics). This specific version of the game gives you both of the expasion packs. Soaked is a expansion that adds pools, water slides, and a few other coasters. Wild adds a couple of animals (and coasters I think.) Soaked is my personal favorite, your park guests, peeps, love pools (in sandbox).\n\nThis is a great game and I recommend you buy it.

My final parks were sprawling estates with flowing gardens and well planned paths. I highly reccomend this game!","June 1, 2014","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know if you like to make things perfectly profitable and enjoy the simulation of being extremely successful or if you just want to wreak havoc in the park to your devilish excitement… One thing's for sure, though, it sure is a lot of fun and your imagination is the limit!\n\nWhat I love about this game is that you get to really create your rides (primarily roller coasters and water rides) and make the place you've probably always dreamed of going to in your childhood… and then even ride it! It's so much fun to even experience a roller coaster that you create virtually [and even ride one that is flying off the rails!] Oh, man… it's so much fun, I've been able to enjoy this hours over hours! I can literally spend an entire day creating an awesome park and still not feel bored at all (until I have a creator's block, which doesn't happen a lot to me.)\n\nIf you feel creative to create a theme park that you've always dreamed about creating but don't have the money or real estate, this game is definitely for you!","June 3, 2014","true","52.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Better (In my humble opinion) than RCT 1 and 2. The game by itself is great, and allows you to be as creative as you want, or rush to that milestone as quickly as possible.\nIf you are like me, and find good sandbox games to be a giant time sucking destroyer of relationships/ruiner of financial stability, then your in luck! There is a mode where you can progress to a certain point, and your finished! You can step back, and know your job is done. And then take a 20min nap and get back to your real job.... Anyways-\n\nMods. Thats right, mods.\nThis game REALLY shines if you install mods. Allowing you to create replicas of Disneyland, Cedar point, or a moon base turned amusment park. You can (with some basic 3D modelling knowledge) create your own objects to be put in, or simply download off of the many 'warehouse' custom-scenery websites. If you are like me, you will spend more time searching the web (deeply) for mods then actually playing the game. You will run out of room on your harddrive, and your GPU's VRAM will scream in agony... All optional though. THIS TIME I'll be only getting a few basics and just playing the.... Wait...

Mostly, this boils down to overcoming a handful of issues, like difficult starting terrain, low funding, etc. You build your park as you see fit (and as money and space will allow), and succeed or fail depending on how well the multitudes of virtual tourists who visit like your park.\n\nMore often than not, you'll usually end up getting your park to a stable economic condition, and then use the excess revenues to build massive, scary, dangerous roller coasters. But that's really what this series has always been about, right? The best part is that because of the 3D graphics, you can ride your own coasters from a first-person view. This easily makes the cost of admission worth it.\n\nMy biggest complaint with this game is that the missions tend to get a little monotonous. Once you overcome whatever hardship the current mission throws at you, you're left building the same park over and over, in an effort to gain more funds and meet the other victory conditions. It's fun, but it can get a little boring. I suspect that most people just like to play the game in sandbox mode, so maybe this isn't as big an issue for others as it is for me. It's certainly not enough for me to not recommend the game, anyhow.\n\nFor cheaper than a ticket to a real theme park, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a pretty good virtual replacement. Even if it gets a little tedious at times.","December 5, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's something about slowly building up your park from a cute little amusement park to a giant attention-grabbing attraction. The game progresses at the pace you play it, so you can race to become the most well-known park in the area, or you can slowly but surely increase your park's size until you're happy with it.\n\nOne of the main parts of the RCT games is the ability to design your own roller coasters. Not a lot has changed with that mechanic since the first game, but there have been improvements. One of the most memorable improvements to the games is that now, in this game, you can ride the coasters you build. This adds the extremely satisfying ability to virtually test every coaster you make, which makes crafting your own coasters even more rewarding.\n\nThis game also allows you to customize some of the peeps (customers) that visit your park. This is actually a pretty cool addition to the series, as it adds that nice little feeling you get when you recognize a familiar peep walking around in your park.\n\nAll in all, if you're not into managing simulation games, even when they're simplified, you might want to skip over this game. On the other hand, if you're looking for a fun game that will eat up your hours like a toddler eats cotton candy, or even want to try a new managing sim, then I highly recommend this title.","December 7, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember the first RollerCoaster Tycoon where it actually got pretty hard to do well, but here it feels too easy. I'd still recommend it because it's still fun to build wicked cool coasters, but it definitely is part of my argument for the dumbing down of video games.","April 13, 2015","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great game but mainly becuase I haven't been exposed to the previous RCT's. But overall I think this game is enjoyable and easy to pick up. If I had kids they would be playing this. If you are buying it wait till it is discounted if you can and access steam alot. Hope this helped. GOT TO GET BACK TO MY PEEPS!!!","June 8, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A well crafted game that makes you think about many aspects of owning a theme park but at the same time lets you go mad with your own designs and themes to make the park your own.\n\nPlay in sandbox and just go CRAAAZZZYY making outlandish rollercoasters that you could never see being made in real life or save them so you can use them again in your campains.\n\nA brilliant game definately worth a buy especially on the cheap. You will have hours of fun. I loved it at the start and still love it now.","June 9, 2014","true","78.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
