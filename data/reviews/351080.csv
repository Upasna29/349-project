Although the graphics are a little outdated, this game is great. Especially in 2001, if you were making a strategy game, it HAD to be based off war. But this one is like Risk, and still, instead of using your armies to conquer the world, you use competitvley low prices and monopolies to do so. One problem I have with the game is that there is no real in-game tutorial, like modt other PC games of the time. However, there is a manual online.","May 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","0"

So I decided to build the company store then upgrade it to the company mall where it promises that I will be able to cut costs of my employees by 15% each level. However, when I proceed to do it. nothing happens. My costs still remains the same. manufacturing costs and the rest are the same. is this game broken? And when i'm playing in the normal mode it seems that even if I had the 'researcher' specialised field, i'm always being overtaken. Even though many years has passed, bugs are prominent in this game causing it to crash. When I research things as well ie.jet engine. my aircraft still looks the same as what I start off with - a propeller driven plane, not like the picture above. what a dissapointment.","December 4, 2015","false","5.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

If you're like me and tend to play a casual game or two to get the hang of things it's very easy to have no idea what you are doing and lose the game. A quick skiim of the manual will give you an idea of what is what and how the game runs.\nI very nearly wrote a bad review after my first game after giving up in just five minutes, I hadn't read the manual and had no clue what I was doing.\n\nThe graphics and sound options on the game are not great, basic graphics and no volume control are something of a turn-off, but you can do what I did and turn off the game's music and ignore the graphiocs quality.\n\nStyle of play.... According to the game there are three ways of playing; production, marketing and research. Nope. You either do all three or you'll have a hard time playing. All you really get top decide is which area you have that edge.\nProduction is the number one priority since lack of products means lack of sales, and with no sales toy have no income to improve the business.\nMarketing and Research are roughly equal, the first gives you unstated bonuses in sales as it makes the product more attractive whilst the second can improve the performance/features/whatever of the product or make it cheaper and faster to produce the product, improving your profit margin.\n\nI could go on but I'm not good at writing reviews so I'll finish with some ratings.\nPlayability 6/10 The game isn't particularly engrossing but is good for quick games (1-2hrs)\nFunctionality 5/10 The game runs easily but I have dealt with random crashes several times (Regular saving helps)\nGraphics 3/10 Not great quality and most of the buttons aren't labelled so you have to work those things out.\nSound 2/10 Volume control is either Loud or Off but the quality isn't bad.\n\nOverall score 4.5/10\nI'm going to give the game a positive recommendation since it's one of those games where if you're looking for somethign quick to play it delivers the goods. It just suffers on quality.","September 30, 2015","true","49.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As a video game, its mediocre at best with so many demographics and color schemes that you'll more than likely will need glasses or go blind when you're done playing it. It has its moments where I have fun with the silly names and overall domination factor when you completely make your product a standard on just one continent let alone the whole world.\n\nI bought this on sale @ 3.29 USD and worth its price. 9.99 USD is a bit much for the type of game you're getting. At 2001, its a good price for its time. But its well over 14+ years. I would say purchase this once it hits 4.99.\n\nEither way, its a solid game.","November 29, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Игра очень хлёстко высмеивает все законы рынка, гарантируя победу тому кто дешевизну рабочей силы ставит вперёд квалификации труда, успевая при этом задирать цены, эксплуатировать детский труд, эксплуатировать иммигрантов, снижать зарплаты, вышвыривать работяг на мороз, экономить на утилизации отходов вываливая их в пересыхающую реку, спаивать офисный планктон, нанимать бандитов, подкупать чиновников, пилить бюджет, устраивать войны...\n\nИгра изначально рассчитана на моддинг (вплоть до добавления своих планет, ололо), так как в ней по дефолту предусмотрены лишь 3 категории товаров - и к каждой нужен индивидуальный подход, и чем выше сложность, тем больше отличий в виду всё большей приближённости стёба к жизни. К примеру, вынос производства поближе к рабам грозит в первую очередь яблоМакам, а в случае с автомобилями уже на среднем уровне сложности покупатель в ценит в первую очередь безопасность (это значит что минимальный уровень сложности это когда вся планета сплошная Россия, и на чужих жизнях можно нехило экономить).\n\nИгра также подчёркивает что завод это центр вселенной. Моллы и ТЦ нужны только для того чтобы работяги с завода могли там зарплату просеять, индустрия развлечений нужна чтобы работяги кувалдами офисы не громили, маркетинг и мерчендайзинг бесполезны без надбавочного продукта, тренинги по продажам фигня, повышение квалификации работяге нужно в первую очередь...\n\nВ виду того что Industrial Giant III нам и не светит, Stardock смело может выпускать сиквел, с катсценами, климатическими условиями, политическими условиями, отсутствием рандома при генерации Земли, ну и так далее.","September 28, 2015","true","32.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"
