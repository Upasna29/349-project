I, as an old dark eye player, love those games. The music fits well and lifts the spirits. The narrater's voice in this game is forcefully, very well performed and explaines atmospheric the beginning and the circumstances in which the hero is introduced. Assembling your group in the tavern is easy to handle. The heroes there are balanced and well specialized in their abilities. Nice graphics show the Middle Ages flair which suits the atmosphere and makes the gameplay coherent. Especially in fights you keep a good overview and situations don't get too hectic.

It is a grid based dungeon crawler with real time combat and runic spell casting. The leveling system is similar to Dungeon Master system, that means by casting spells you lvl up sorcery, by using melee weapons you lvl up fighting skills. So a fighter can be trained to become a great wizard/healer as well.\nThe game is full of clever puzzles and riddles. It does not pull you by the hand, but for me it is a plus.\n\nThe graphics are nice, and the controls have improved after the new patch.\n\nThe game has a great potential, and I am looking forward to the full realease version of the game. So far only a town and a temple with 4 levels is accessible.\n\nThis game is a must have for every old school RPG fan like myself","December 21, 2015","true","7.4"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/329040/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDungeon Kingdom is very well made and very difficult dungeon crawler where you create a team of four characters from various classes like warrior, priest, and mage, including combinations of these, and as a unit this group must tackle the various puzzles, obstacles, and enemies the game throws at you.\nYour team functions as a single unit in movement, and movement occurs along an invisible grid, meaning you can only go in one of the four directions. Control is done by keyboard and turning can also be done by keyboard, or by mouse.\nThe game has very hard puzzles that require you to actually pay attention to hints dropped by other characters or found in books, or quick on the spot thinking to manipulate obstacles, levers, and the like.\nEverything happens real time, including the combat. Physical combat (hand-to-hand or swords) is done by clicking on the hand icons of the various characters, they will then strike directly in front. Magical combat can be done the same way if you've prepared quick spells.\n\nOn to magic: the game uses a combine system of runes that requires some learning, but can quickly become intuitive. For example, fire + breath/wind = fireball. Once you've succesfully created/cast a spell, it gets added to a quick list for future access.\nAs the game happens in real time your characters will also get hungry and thirsty, eventually losing health points if you don't take care of their needs. This adds an extra challenge to the game.\n\nThe difficulty of this game is high, but that will hopefully change somewhat as the game gets closer to release. The game is currently in early access, and there are some elements that don't seem as polished in the current build. NPCs don't actually appear in the world, but suddenly pop up as a portrait with (mostly voiced) dialogue. All portraits, including the player portraits, appear to be photoshopped photos of real people, this gives a somewhat strange effect. On the one hand it is realistic and still fitting to the game world, on the other hand it gives the odd effect during dialogue scenes where the game stretches and otherwise deforms the faces to give the illusion of speaking.\n\nFeatures I really miss are a map to keep track of where you've been and where the next objective is, as well as a notebook. I know the game's old school inspirations such as the Might & Magic series didn't have these features too, but as a gamer of today I'm no longer used to having to make actual notes on pen and paper to keep track of all the info the game expects me to remember.\n\nOn a technical level, the game runs smoothly, with a constant framerate. Soundeffects are effective, nothing special there yet but no real bad picks either. Graphics are really good, with good lighting effects and nice effects on spells.\n\nI can definitely recommend this game for anyone who is familiar with dungeon crawlers like Legend of Grimrock,  Might and Magic, or Wizardry. It already hits all the notes that draw me in to that genre and despite not being as polished yet as a full scale release, there is enough here to already give a fun, if really challenging experience.","November 22, 2015","true","2.6"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","27","39","0","3"

It took me back to those days, in many ways. Now where do I start, you begin the game in a conventional manner of choosing your party and other things.\n\nAfter that, that's where the game actually starts, you aren't given too many clues on what's ahead, you have to pay attention to the dialogue, pay attention to your enviroment and read all the books and scrolls in order to get a gist of things especially those that will come in handy later.\n\nThe controls take a bit of getting used to but it's intuitive once you do so, same with the inventory management and in general the gameplay.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, in a late 90s/early 00s way, when things were beginning to be pretty but you still had to use the imagination to fill in the blanks.\n\nGameplay is straightforward for anyone who has played Wizardry, Dungeon Master and other first person RPG classics, it's relatively straightforward for those who haven't, as the tutorial explains everything you need to know.\n\nYou explore, solve puzzles, combat monsters but the most impressive thing about the game, it's FILLED to brim with secrets, chances are that instead of progressing in the main story, you'll land up in a whole lot bunch of secrets instead, because the game rewards curiosity and exploration.\n\nThis game certainly has potential and the devs really pay attention to their feedbacks and bug reports, so i'm sure the game will be even better with time.","November 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

I have a newish gaming laptop, high end stuff, but it is very sluggish unless I turn the video settings down and lower the resolution. It should not tax it based on the fairly simple graphics of this game, so it must be poor coding. That does not really bother me, but what does is the fact that the save game feature often glitches. You load you last saved game, and all your players have lost everthing they own. All weapons, armor and inventory is gone.\nMy suggestion: Save often, and do not override one save, create a new file each time. That way, if a save is messed up, you can go to the save before it and not lose too much time.\nStill, I love this style of game and keep at it. If you really liked the Legond of Grimrock I and II, you will like this game. It is not as polished and you have to be careful with the saves, but until the next Grimrock comes out (and there is no plan for that, at least that I could find) this is the only option out there that I know of.","May 4","true","10.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/recommended/329040/","losian","Losian Rooke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/","285 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a game where I wish Steam had a "maybe" option instead of YES or NO. I'm putting yes just because that feels more fair than putting no, but here's my hotughts. I didn't play for too long obviously, and I like a lot of what I see, but there's a handful of things that make me want to wait until it comes out of early access and is fully and officially 'released'!\n\nVOICES: Some of the earlier parts of the game appear to be voiced, not sure if more will be or just some bits, but honestly this one of those things.. Ya kinda gotta go all in or go home. In this case I'm assuming their budget and voice cast options are limited so, as far as voice, I say go home. Put your focus into good and compelling writing rather than voicing a few characters in a mediocre fashion! It'll pay off way more.\n\nART/AESTHETIC: The character portraits look like some paint overs of stock photos and, frankly, they're not bad. But when engaging in dialogue with some characters the potraits are mashed and contorted to give the illusion of expression and speaking and.. it really just doesn't look good. I applaud the developer for trying to add more like that but it just looks super strange; maybe this is something that'll be improved, but I frankly don't know that I've ever seen the warping thing done well for mouth movements and facial expressions for dialogue. The painted protraits look just fine, let them do the talking for you - we as players can imagine them moving, don't hamfist it in via weird morphing and smushing of things around.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Movement is good, the game itself looks nice as far as the environments and all. I'd love to see some more character options as far as races - as is there's a swathe of humans, a dozen or so elves, two dark elves, one dwarf, one halfling, one "labian" wolf-type character, and a small trio of "other". It's not a bad mix, but it'd be nice to have at least a couple of each options, i.e. someone can make a halfling dominant party or similar, and not be forced to choose other races, or be able to mix whatever combo they like. Basically, at least four of each, ideally?\n\nCONTROLS: I'd love to be able to remap controls but there seemed to be no ability to do so - In this style of grid-based movement I prefer A and S to turn, and Q and E to strafe, but their controls are locked to Q and E turn, and A and S strafe. It'd be nice to be able to customize these as we see fit. Maybe in the launcher? The in game menu didn't have the option, anyhow.\n\nAnd speaking of, the controls are a tad inconsistent and not intuitive. Left clicking picks up an item in the world, but uses an item if in your inventory, rather than pick it up, so that creates some "oops I used a potion/read a scroll/etc." moments when you're trying to navigate things. It'd also be nice to be able to drop items on a character's portrait and it go into their first open inventory slot; instead you have to open the inventory, which removes visibility of other character's/inventory/hands/portraits, and gives you their bag slots.\n\nUI: I think the dev could size down the inventory UI and keep visible your hands/your parties hands, and even make at least the first row of your party's bags visible for ease of moving stuff around, as is it definitely is a bit clunky.\n\nI'm really on the fence - I almost wanna refund it and wait til' it's finished and out, but I do like a bit of what I'm seeing. Honestly a lot of my thoughts here aren't big game breakers, but all together it's enough to kinda be just annoying enough that it leaves me uncertain. A more intuitive menu/UI would be great, and it'd be nice of hitting ESC closed bags/stat screens/etc. as you'd expect, but instead it pulls up the game menu, which takes several seconds to slowly pop into view and then pop back out, which creates some annoying moments if you open it by accident when trying to close out something else quickly.\n\nWhen it comes to games of a particular style I strongly feel like devs should take what we know works - Might and Magic, Grimrock, etc.- and build on that as far as controls go. There's control schemes we're used to and as a result expected ways for it to work; don't reinvent that wheel. By all means do nuts on the magic and items and skills and all that, blow our minds with that, but don't make your controls rigid and kinda wonky. :D Recreating that doesn't add anything to your game, it just frustrates folks. Mimicking control functionality is one of the best things you can "take" if anything, in my opinion, when it's done well repeatedly elsewhere. The left-click varying functionality is really what threw me off the most, and the lack of ability to adjust or change controls from within the game.\n\nMAP: I also think the lack of ANY kind of map is a mistake. I know, I know. I grew up on grid paper and walked uphill both ways on dial-up and all that too, it's okay. But you have to realize that, these days, it's just not the same. I don't think I could even find a pen lying around, much less graph paper or something to draw up maps with, and as the developer said themselves, due to the 3D nature it'd be near impossible to map well.. But that also kinda begs the question, if it's that hard to make a map of it, how are we expected to navigate it without reasonably well and not just end up running circles and just dying?\n\nSome kind of compromise seems necessary here. At the VERY least I think a rough 'area map' that designates where you are and the rough size/shape of space is enough, something to at least help people navigate around in a general sense and be able to find entrances/exits/etc., while not being a perfect grid-by-grid representation necessarily. Or heck, I kinda like the DS/3DS Etrian method of giving you the tools to draw up your map, it was a clever way to provide both maps and mapping\n\nEdit: I just loaded it up and got the Unity launcher to check the inputs there.. You can adjust controls.. sorta? You can adjust the horizontal and vertical, but there's no options to change the turn bindings, which default to Q and E; they aren't even shown, in fact. :( I understand that there are often limitations when working with particular engines, but that kinda stuff can be a real sticking point, as it's awful frustrating to have to constantly remind oneself that what is usually turn is strafe and vice versa.\n\nI feel like there's a pretty good 'heart' here as far as a solid Might and Magic/Grimrock/etc. dungeon crawler, but there's just enough polish missing that I'm really just not sure.\n\nI also am kind've a grump and I hate to see just four classes. Maybe it's from a decade of playing MUDs and other RPGs and being so horribly tired of the SAME things, but just seeing heavy melee/light melee or range/divine caster/arcane caster as my only options just.. well it makes me sad, it smacks of a painful lack of desire to try and mix things up a bit.. There seems like there may be some hybridization which changes it up a little, but I'm not sure how much with what I've poked at thus far.\n\nI do like the atmosphere and aesthetic of the game itself, it's solid. I like that you can peer down into pit traps and such, that opens a whole new venue for puzzles, and I like that, for example, hanging cloth on the wall can be set alight; that opens yet another angle for puzzles and secrets if there are a variety of physics interactions (lightning, fire, ice, etc. for manipulating the environment?) I don't know how much of this exists or is used in the game, but it's promising in any case to see that kind of thing!\n\nTL;DR - I kinda like, I think I could totally like it with at least a few minor adjustments, you may totally like it, but I also think there's enough little snags that may just bother the hell out of you. Depending on what's left to change before "release" they may totally mop up all these little things, or maybe they'll carry on over to release and it'll remain kinda annoying.","November 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","3"

After playing it for a few hours, I can safely say that it's a great purchase! You can tell a lot of effort has gone into the story and there are interesting hidden things to find. Overall it plays well, especially for an early access game and I look forward to more updates and the full version!","November 19, 2015","true","3.7"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","13","28","0","0"

It is currently in Early Access, but for being an early version it is pretty well playable. All the key features are there, the systems (fighting, magic, resting, eating/drinking, levelling) are in place. The graphics are very pretty and compare well with recent 3D RPGs.\n\nThe Early Access version offers two main environments. The game starts in the wintry city of Barimbar during night-time, where the streets are deserted and you first learn of a looming menace: the Guild of Magic which protects Barimbar is in danger from a rival faction, and betrayal abounds left, right and centre. After recruiting your party of 4 you are sent to the great temple to fulfil a mysterious prophecy and aid the Guild. The temple level makes up the bulk of this version, featuring the beautiful upper levels and some run-down, maze-like lower levels where you’ll encounter both puzzles and fights.\nThe puzzles in this early stage aren’t too difficult, and paying attention to books and scrolls and thus the “lore“ of the world is definitely rewarded. The fights work alright too, but this is where the EA’s biggest issue lies. The AI still has some problems and occasionally prefers to wander around the room and take hits instead of actually fighting back. There are some balancing issues as well, but these are actively being fixed already, as seen in the first update two days after launch.\n\nA special feature that many other crawlers lack is the physics system. Many objects are flammable, items have a weight, they can be thrown and roll around on the floor. This makes for some nice options for both puzzles and fights. Sometimes passageways and buttons are hidden behind curtains that can be traversed, making them sway in the air, or burnt down. Levels are continuous, which means that you can climb ladders, jump down pits, or throw items through them, all without any loading in between. One time I managed to kill a monster by luring it onto a rug and setting it on fire with a candle. Stuff like this is very satisfying and fun to experiment with.\nObviously a lot of content in terms of levels is still missing from the EA version, but spring 2016 is still some time away. The content right now makes for around 4 hours of gameplay. So if you like dungeon crawlers and would like to witness the development of an indie game, give this one a shot!","November 22, 2015","true","10.0"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

My experience with this game is for the most part positive with the only negative coming from my lack of experience with the genre. This game has very solid groundwork for an early access game. The graphics are quite nice and the framerate is smooth. The story although unfinished (according to the devs) is well done with scrolls to give more lore information. The gameplay seems to be pretty standard for a game of this genre so if you are fan this is a must buy for you. My only negative point is that I found that this genre is not quite my style.","November 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"
