It has an appealing art style and the controls feel very fluid and responsive.\n\nIt has both single and multiplayer modes to keep you entertained and is a lot of fun during heated local multiplayer skirmishes.\n\nI just wish that it had online multiplayer so that I could play with a wider variety of people.\n\nI recommend this game for people who enjoy frantic local multiplayer matches.","August 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

If you are looking at Capsule Force as a single player game you will probably be disappointed. While I had fun with the single player missions I see them more as a training exercise for the multiplayer mode.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is where the game excels. It is hard to explain why but the game is just fun to play. The game is fast paced with both teams fighting in order to progress one of the trams towards the other team's base. Bullets will end up flying all over the screen. The game has a lot of back and forth as one team will make some progress and then the other team will regain that ground.\n\nUnfortunately at the time of this review the game doesn't appear to have online multiplayer. This is disappointing since the game would have been better since you could then have more matches with four players which are probably more fun than two player matches.\n\nIf you like fast paced multiplayer games and the concept of the game looks interesting to you, I think you will enjoy Capsule Force.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Capsule Force. Other than receiving the free review copy I received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","August 30, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm a fan of the indie platformers and willing to try most things under $20 if they are justified. I honestly hoped to find more to this local multiplayer game but after under an hour on single player mode I'm having a difficult time.\n\nThe missions are similar to early smash brothers target practice modes, 'avoid getting hit' speed runs, general control testing and advanced versions of target practice. Beating modes with ranks C or above means moving onto the next set of missions (eventually resulting in alternate stage layouts), B and above means alternate costumes, A and S rank means concept art. Beating all mission types and levels unlocks hardmode and credits.\n\nIf this game goes under 60% on sales and you host video game parties comfortably with steam then pick this game up for variety, otherwise I can't reccomend this for single players who require online multi-player more often than not.\nThe art style is very cute and I greatly support the people at the previously mentioned podcast.\n\n1 Anime/5 Animes","March 6","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
