I knew that going in.  What I didn't expect was it to be so damn frustrating (in a bad way) with so little explanation of what the ♥♥♥♥ to do.","December 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 58 of 83 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","58","83","7","3"

Its a dark puzzle game which has seen me gassed, spiked, sliced open with a swinging axe thing, burnt to dead and fallen into the dark abyss below.  I'l be honest i was surprised by how much I liked this game.\n\nFirst thing that caught my eye was it was so cheap.  The controls felt basic at the start but it didnt take me long to get used to them.  Also For anyone who thinks the game is too hard the game creators in their mercy have put in a hint key. Anytime your stuck hit the H key and you get a hint at the area your stuck at.  Tempting to use all the time but it still doesn't ruin the puzzle when you do use it.\n\nAlso a great bonus is the respawning so close to where you die.  The checkpoints must be every 5 or 10 steps as I never seem to respawn too far away from where i died.  In a puzzle game like this where you die alot this comes in handy.\n\nThe grusome ragdoll deaths keep in with the tone of the game if that makes sence and even the way the characters ponytail bobs when running are wee signs the creators were thinking when putting this together.\n\nI'm gonna keep playing this as it has my attention.\n\nHeres a first level play through if you are still making up your mind.\n\nP.S Any laggyness is the fault of my computer running recording software at the same time.  The game itself is usually smooth when the recording software is off.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7RNzLhLg9Y","December 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

You play a girl who's sister is abducted by alien robots, and it's your job to get her back. Along the way, you free other trapped children you come across, drive a monster truck, and even wield a powerful machine gun.\n\nOverall, I found the levels and puzzles to be reasonably inventive and fun to complete. There is one particular puzzle that requires too much repetition, which momentarily slows the pace of the game. But once you get past it, the game moves along again at a brisk pace. Also, the last couple of levels are fairly large and could definitely use some additional checkpoints.\n\nGiven the length and quality of Umbra, I'd say the game is priced very fairly at $4. It takes 4 to 5 hours to complete. I never got stuck in the game, but there's a helpful hint system should you need it. But seriously, if you finished Limbo, nothing in Umbra should hold you up for very long.\n\nI definitely recommend Umbra. I played through the game twice, the second time picking up some extra achievements. It's not as polished or original as Limbo, but it's a fun game for those who enjoy the genre.\n\nNote: Don't let the minimum requirements of an I5 processor deter you. This game plays smoothly on my mid-level Core-2-Duo with a humble Radeon HD 4670 graphics card. Try the demo if you're not sure your system can handle it.","January 15","true","13.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
