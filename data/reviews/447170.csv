The endings are not always happy, however the stories are engaging, very different to each other and have a fair amount of main story line differences that it makes it interesting to play trough each one.\n\nThis game is also unique in the way that it is impossible to fail a route. The ending is decided by one final decision in each route. How much a character likes you only determines chat lines with you and the amount of pictures that you get. Having in mind that I Have 7 hours of play time I would estimate the total play time available, if you're not 100% character likes and the galery to be around 11 hours.\n\nSmall warning, if very forward guys are not your thing (and I mean sexual groping in some cases, in others forced nudity) you might not enjoy all the routes and therefore consider it not worth your money.\n\nI have already gotten more entertainment value out of this than out of Amnesia: Memories, and because I actually feel like each character is appealing in their own way I'm likely to actually finish all the routes.","April 7","true","20.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I may go further into detail later on, but for now I'll give a brief review and explaination at the end.\n\nPros:\n-Great artwork\n-Beautiful soundtrack\n-Varied character archetypes\n-Fairly interesting story\n\nCons:\n-Some QC errors with a good chunk of typos, missing grammar, and awkward sentences. (Still better than Kikuya's QC problems though)\n-Game fell short of a good bit of potential the story and characters had\n-Became somewhat dull in places\n\nOverall, for the price, I'd highly recommend the game for otome fans. While there's better titles out there if you're new/just getting into the otome scene, Destiny's Princess was an enjoyable play for its length. However, there is quite a lot of sad/bittersweet endings, so If you're looking for a very "feel good" otome, then you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nI've seen a few people comment negatively about the fact that there are two "incest" routes, but what a lot of people fail to mention is that, while there is quite a lot of incestual context, the two routes in question are not true incest routes. The male characters in those routes have "taken the place" of the protagonist's twin brother and father, but they are not actually related in any way. This is explained right off the bat in every route.","April 18","true","19.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Why the thumbs down? (Well I may change my mind at a later point, so I intend to update this review eventually...)  But for now thumbs down because:\n\n- No matter how hard I try, I find the story line extremely boring.\n- The choices I decide rarely ever increase my "likeability."\n- The fact that they even include likeability as you go confuses me greatly. Part of me feels obligated to check every so often to see if I made the right choices (gee, if only real life were like that, LOL.)\n- Everything just seems utterly random with no real thought put into it.\n- The translations are kind of ... meh? IDK. Hard to explain. I feel like this would benefit from localizing or whatever you gamer geeks call it.\n- Characters seem flat asf. Yawn. I don't care how sexy you can draw, animators, if the characters are boring, I just don't GAF. :-(\n\nI will keep plodding onward in an attempt to finish the story line. I am around Chapter 3 ish right now so maybe it picks up? I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME. But I feel like it is a chore to keep playing it, not something I look forward to, so maybe it's just not for me.

The drawing is better, the facial features are brilliant, the writing is very polished in this game - and the text flows a lot easier than in Yoshiwara. I would sometimes trip over words playing Yoshiwara because they weren't correct, but this was great.\n\nI chose to romance Date Masamune, a man that takes after his feudal lord name, and I was not disappointed. Unlike Yoshiwara, I got a very "Amnesia: memories" feel from this game, and my relationship with the men felt a lot more genuine. I wasn't looking at guides to help me decide how to respond because I understood the characters and knew how to push their buttons this time around - I was given a load more time to fall in love with the characters. Albeit that there are only 8 chapters in this game whereas Yoshiwara had 13 as I recall.\n\nFurthermore there are two different happy endings, provided you get the happy endings, so I recommend you go back and play both, as they differ immensely. I like the music a lot more this time around, too. The yoshiwara one started to grate on me halfway through my first playthrough.\n\nI definitely recommend you walk into this game blind. The first time I played and I woke up in the castle, I was seriously confused alongside the Princess. Also, I get the steam store's language in the "about this game" is pretty naff, but if you're an otome fan, and if you like manga like tsuki no shippo, crazy girl shin bia or Goong, you'll like this. I thouroughly enjoyed it and I'm off to play the next man.\n\nGet it whilst it's on offer too. Sadly, I don't think it's quite worth £12 - If you have £12 I'd recommend stardew valley or something instead, but this is neat for £7.19","April 8","true","3.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

For one, I bought this on sale for about 10€ and after few hours in I wouldn't buy it again.

A choise between "Ignore it" and "Pretend not to hear".

I loved the characters (though two of those story lines got... oh my GOD dark!!!) and I liked that not all of them had the typical "happy ending".  It's nice to see a game not be afraid to tell the story they want to tell, even if it doesn't finish in a big bow.\n\nI liked the touches about the characters that came from their real-life counterparts (like Masamune and Yukimura having times they feel they shouldn't get along).\n\nThe music is nice, the art is lovely. Some situations get a liiiiiiiittle uncomfortable, but overall they're fantastic (and the uncomfortable parts aren't anything that would ruin it).\n\nI wish there had been mor to the "sequels" but, meh, for what it is, it works.\n\nDownside: Like with ANY otome, I am left with wanting more and wishing there was a sequel!\nand I guess the sequels and the date scenarios are kind of weak, but the main story more than makes up for it.\n(also...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/recommended/447170/","octobig","Octobig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/","36 products in account","In Destiny's Princess: A War Story, A Love Story, you are the princess of a country in a world based on ours during the Warring States period of Japan (1467-1603). Overrun by demons, the country is slowly falling into ruin -- but your family has an age-old heirloom that is known to grant wishes only in the most difficult of situations. Desperate for help, you call to the heirloom for aid, which puts five heroes at your beck and call... But every wish has its price. Will you be able to save your country and will the hero you love stay by your side?\n\nBrought to you by the same studio that was responsible for The Men of Yoshiwara: Kikuya, this game is a definite improvement compared to that one in many ways, and certainly not just a copy. Almost no grammar/editing/translation errors anymore, a better soundtrack, higher quality images, and a full-screen option that is actually viable -- though it does have slightly less content than Kikuya.\n\nPros+ Interesting underlying story about the demons & the heirloom\n+ Character personalities are fairly consistent but a bit boring\n+ Pretty art and nice character designs\n+ Almost impossible not to get together with the man of your choice\n+ Short sequel stories & date scenarios to play after unlocking the main ending(s)\n\nCons- Your choices do not seem to affect the story much\n- Creepy sexual behaviour from groping to forcing the heroine into doing sexual stuff, though this is not present in all romance routes\n- Endings with low likeability don't really differ from the ones with high likeability\n- There are a couple of incestual angles to the story\n- No voice-acting\n\nAll-in-all, this game doesn't shy away from tragic endings and drama, and I thought it was nice how differently the heroine develops throughout the different romance routes. And a tragic ending with a lot of death doesn't necessarily mean it's all over... illustrated very nicely by ending B with Nobunaga (save him for last!) which is probably my favourite one. I wouldn't necessarily buy it at full price, though, since there are romantic visual novels/otome games with a better story and better characters (such as Nameless), but you can definitely get some enjoyment out of this one, too!","April 17","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/recommended/447170/","narucch","☆ Naruchin ☆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/","120 products in account","I originally purchased Kotaro's, Masamune's and Hanbei's routes on the mobile version, but I didn't think twice when I saw this released on Steam and immediately purchased it.\n\nThe art is extremely beautiful, although I'm sad there is no e-mote system. The music is okay. The writing and localization, for what originally was a mobile otome, are really good. The translation flows really well and is very modern ('okay', 'jeez') which is a good thing. Like all Forbidden Romance games, the writing can get a little steamy (bonus points). The interactions among the characters were well done and the hints to solve the bigger mystery spread throughout the various routes, although only in Nobunaga's we can see resolutions.\nBe warned, all the routes have two endings, one in which the guy stays in the Princess' world, one in which the Princess goes into the guy's world. Not all the characters have happy endings. Some are just doomed.\nAs MC, the Princess isn't half bad. Really depends on the route and the ending. She could have been worse for an otoge MC. Also, she has eyes in the CGs, which is a HUGE bonus :)\n\nNow, let's talk about men :> and trigger warnings.\nMy suggestions regarding route orders are as follow: Masamune = Yukimura > Kotaro = Hanbei > Nobunaga; the first two routes focus heavily on romance and less on plot, order can be switched up. The second two routes give more hints regarding the bigger picture, again order is up to preference. Nobunaga's route has all the answers and as the game tell you, is very spoiler heavy.\n- I really liked Masamune's route. He's a very cute guy and a genuine good person. He's also very respectful of the Princess' wishes, and his narrative is a take on the 'different social classes' trope. One of my favorites.\n- Yukimura's route dealt with 'incest'. Of course, Yukimura is not the real twin brother of the Princess, but he is convinced he is for 95% of the time and still rolls with it. Incest is not my thing so it made me slightly uncomfortable.\n- Kotaro's route was extremely refreshing because he appears so mischievous and carefree, but of course he's not, being a ninja and all. They had many sweet, sweet moments together. Should probably warn for one of his ending, in which he's 'so caught with passion that he has to satiate his lust RIGHT NOW', which personally makes me eyeroll every time. The other ending was cute tho.\n- Hanbei's route should have a big warnig for ♥♥♥♥ and abuse. Which kinda gets brushed off in the end by the Princess. Otoge MCs... nevertheless, I did enjoy his route.\n- Now, Nobunaga. Ooh boy. Where to start. The man is a pig and acts sleazy despite the fact that everybody around you sees him as your father. Also the writing seems to push you to like him. Uhm not really. I did enjoy the spoilers (some were pretty OMG WTF and made so much sense) and the endings were wicked good. But as I stated early, incest and play-pretend incest are squicky to me so I was uncomfortable playing his route. Also ♥♥♥♥ warning.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a solid port of a good mobile otome. The price is amazing considering it has all the main scenarions, all the sequels and the date scenarios. Does it have flaws? Certainly. I still found it an enjoyable read. Recommended :)","April 27","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm giving it a negative for some reasons, but it isn't a bad game or anything.\n\nThe story: The protagonist is a princess, in a castle being attacked by demons. The princess, in an attempt to save herself, found a "dagger" that has a demon inside that can grant wishes. Using this dagger, she wishes something and because of her wish, five men are brought from other worlds and replace her brother, father, fiance, and some other people. The prologue ends and you get to choose who you wanna "date".\n\nRegarding the routes, there were two good routes ( Kotaro and Masamune), one "meh" route (Yukimura) and two bad routes(Hanbei and, urk, Nobunaga ). These two good routes kinda saved the game for me because it didn't have anything that freaked me out (like in Yoshiwara: Kikuya) and the character were very likeable, but the other three routes... oh man, they are the reasons for my negative review. Then again, this is just my opinion :p\n\nAnother thing about the routes that I didn't like is that what is happening is only revealed in Nobunaga's route, so I played all the other routes wondering "what the hell is happening?" when it would be much better discovering what's happening little by little while playing and not have to deal with that ♥♥♥♥ ton of information in Nobunaga's route.\n\nIt's like they didn't felt the need to develop the story at all too because it felt so confusing and bad sometimes, all the "sad" moments were too forced for me to enjoy them and the romance in some routes were so bad that I wanted to puke  *cof* *cof* Nobunaga *cof* *cof*\n\nThe system was okay, the only thing that annoyed me was that there was no volume button, but considering that this is a mobile game port, I will let it slide~ The music are okay, but it has the same problem that Yoshiwara: Kikuya had, it has only four~five music. This game has less grammar and translation errors, which is nice.\n\nThe art is pretty and the backgrounds were all beautiful, but some CGs were kinda derp to me and it could have been more CGs too, there's a Yukimura CG that occupies almost three pages and only has some minor changes... <_< And again, I don't think the full price is worth it. This game is nice and pretty, but the routes are short (some chapters can be read in less than fifteen minutes...), there isn't that much content, it's not voiced, the menus are a bit bad looking too and the story is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed up  If you don't believe me, go play Nobunaga's route\n\nNot an awful Otome Game, but I wouldn't buy it if it wasn't on promo.","April 20","false","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Two completely different games, despite them having the same annoying tendency to do loop music that you can't mute! Ahem. Back to it. Destiny's Princess didn't have the same length to it or content - it was shorter and more condensed. The visuals were nice but there seemed to be a lack of still images and some were just repeated with the characters only changing in view by their lips or stance. It was a little dissapointing.\n\nThe plot of DP was incredibly cliche being centered around all the male characters loving the herione  and even hinting at incest.  I'm not sure if I can say I enjoyed the game or not. There were parts that I liked and parts that I didn't like. I am certainly not used to there being  character death that you can do nothing differently to prevent it from happening.  That was a real heart-string puller. It was like watching a FF7 cinematic.\n\nSo let's pro/con:\nPro:\n-Gorgeous male characters\n....yeah, sorry that's all I have for the pros.\n\nCon:\n-Typical female lead (damsel in distress, blah blah blah)\n-Consistent loop music\n-Lack of still visuals\n-Some grammar and punctuation errors\n-Lack of choices  It doesn't really matter what you do in the game as it doesn't effect the two endings you can recieve on any character path. You can simply save when it comes to the ending choice and play from there.\n-Lack of smut scenes! This is probably based on personal preference but VN's should always be steamy or have proper kissing scenes. This didn't cut it!\n\nSo at the end of the day, would I actually recommend this game to another person? In all honesty, no. For the amount of content you get for the price and time you put into it, definitely not. There is no replay value either. Through every character playthrough it just became more and more cliche and boring - I was actually just pressing enter a lot to skip dialogue because it was just so uninteresting and flat with no charm.\n\nHowever, I would recommend it as a first-time Otome/VN. It's less complicated and simpler than some of the others I have played but for experienced Otome players? Nup don't think so.","May 27","false","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now that I know more about his character I simply fell in love with him. I also liked the main character's personality during his route. As for Yukimura... his route felt a bit uncomfortable at times.\n\nI enjoyed how each character has a distinct way of acting in each route. If you play the other routes, the dialogue isn't repetitive where you have to push the skip button to fast forward already seen dialogue (only if you choose to when you replay for their other ending). So I recommend this game, to those who like romance, otome, and historical Japanese setting. With the 40% off, it's a reasonable price~\n\nPredictions for other characters:\nKotaro - Based on the routes, he seems like a good friend to have so I'm curious to see how he acts when the main character dates him.\nHanbei - I feel terrible for not choosing his route sooner. I'll be playing his route next even though I might cry.\nNobunaga - I hope it's not as awkward as Yukimura's route even though you know he's not really the main character's father.

Sure, they try to make it fit within the context, but it was incredibly frustrating for me because the character you're playing is so useless. While they don't go into graphic detail, they definitely go further than needed. If ever there's something I as a woman really don't want to roleplay, it's being sexually assaulted.
