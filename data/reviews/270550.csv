You kite around a lantern and must survive several waves. On 4th wave you'll have enough money to buy a better weapon (I prefer the sniper rifle) or start to build up your camp. Therefore are wooden or steel palisades and turrets where you can mount all weapons.\n\nEvery wave you evolve more. But the zombies do also. Each property of their damage, life and speed raises by a factor. There are even more effective weapons like a rocketlauncher, the tesla coil or a lasercannon, but the ammo is mostly too expensive or the reload time is quite too long.\n\nAnother mode is the endless night mode. which you gain after 10 waves of survival. In endless night mode there are no palisades. Weapons spawn by random of killed zombies. Here you must survive 5 min max.\nThe MP is stable and makes fun. Achievements are partly deactivated for MP. Don't miss this little but nice game.

I played for a few hours with a friend and it was a lot of fun but I have a few suggestions to improve gameplay:\n\n1. SKILLS\n-You can put a point after every round into a skill\n-Skills could be like: accuracy, damage, run speed. and scavenger (get more from cash/supply drops)\n\n2. GUN UPGRADES\n-Pay to get various upgrades/attatchments to your guns\n-Such as: incendiary (does dmg over time) explosive (hurts more than one target) or like an increase in damage, accuracy or firing speed\n\n3.CHARACTERS\n-We need just a little bit of character development, who is "The Girl"? Or "The SWAT"?\n-I suggest adding MORE characters and giving them each starting attributes depending on who they are like: The SWAT gets a defense bonus due to his bulletproof vest.\n\n4.TRAPS\n-You should add more traps and trap like elements to the game\n-Such as a bear trap that costs, say, $50 and you could put them in a 1/4 space of a normal tile\n-Fire traps would be cool\n\n5.PALISADES\n-Palisades should decay with damage and you should have to pay to repair them\n-The advantage of this would be you could add in palisade damage. As in they do damage to zombies based on how new and freshly repaired they are.\n\nThese are just a few suggestions that I thought could make this game better, even though it already is pretty addicting.\n\n-Zac\n\nP.S. Add some detail to the map, just a few cracks in the concrete or litter. Something to make it more immersive.\n\nEDIT: Nearly a year later, I played this game again and saw that the devs practically took all my ideas and implemented them and I couldn't be happier! Skills and traps have been added and so have harmful palisades! They also added a couple of aesthetic details to the map! Awesome work guys and thanks for using my ideas :D","October 30, 2014","true","32.0"," 115 of 130 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","115","130","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/270550/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I could likely sum up this entire review by simply stating the title of the game in question: Yet Another Zombie Defense. Intended as a sideways joke at the ridiculous number of zombie themed games flooding the market, it extends beyond the name to every aspect of the game, resulting in a bland and unimaginative isometric shooter that even for the low price is hardly worth a second glance.\n\nIf you've ever played a wave based survival shooter you already know exactly how YAZD functions. Enemies come at you in increasingly difficult swarms, which you then counter by buying guns and defense in between rounds. Rinse, repeat, and try to stay alive as long as you can. It's a formula that's been done dozens of times over, but when executed properly can be immensely addictive and rewarding.\n\nYou can probably see where I'm going with this, so I'll just spell it out: YAZD doesn't get it right. A surface summarization of the many games that inspired it, it has the right pieces to potentially make a great game but doesn't know how to use them effectively. Progression is severely limited and uninteresting, with only a handful of unimpressive guns to choose from and even fewer defenses, as well as no upgrade system or other means to provide something to keep playing for beyond a highscore. Enemies are repetitive to far too great a degree, making for a dull experience after the first few waves as you begin to go through the motions, and the banal presentation leaves a great deal to be desired.\n\nTo be perfectly fair, YAZD isn't broken on any fundamental level, it's just not fun. Everything it attempts has already been done infinitely better in so many other games, that I can't bring myself to recommend it for even a quick look. There's an argument to be made for it being cheap so expectations are obviously lowered, but personally I would recommend spending a bit more and getting something more polished and deserving of your time. You might be able to squeeze an hour of enjoyment out of it with a friend if you really try, but that doesn't make up Yet Another Zombie Defense being as hollow and lifeless as the undead it pits against you.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 399 of 576 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","399","576","4","24"

Terrible launch game with infinite amount of bug and generally unpleasant gameplay that got relaunched not once but 3 times but eventually end up somewhat good enough to play and cheap enough to justify the few remaining bugs?\n\nWell Yet Another Zombie Defense is a bit like that except it never got relaunched, there was hardly any bugs, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥♥ and contents are barebone. Yet I am actually recommending it because:\n\nA) It does what it say it does well which is a horde based game defending against zombie.\nB) It was already super cheap to begin with.\nAnd C) It actually got updated.\n\nAt its core Yet Another Zombie defense is a topdown shooter that has you defending a highly important streetlight for as long possible and to accomplish this you kill zombies to get money for turrets, barricades, ammo and more guns with random drops happening throughout the match. It used to be that the game has practically zero content but now it has more turret and barricade types and far more stable netcode.\n\nBTW Netcode as in COOP. Thats right one of the major saving grace apart from all the alphabets which I have listed is that it has coop. Defend against the undead hordes with up to 3 other mate with a total of 4 people in 1 game and with the price chances are most people already own it. Money are shared between all 4 and only the host can decide what to buy so bickering will happen.\n\nIts a pretty fun game, not much of a substance, does what it does well with minimalist gameplay and graphics. What more could you ask for about a game defending a streetlight probably covered in meat from the undead horde? For the cost of a couple of high value cards you and your mate could probably enjoy this stupid thing for a few hours and thats more than enough in my book.","November 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","79","55","70","17","0"

However, people fail to realize that this is supposed to be a fun little zombie shooter, heck, that's why it's priced at $2.\n\nThat being said, some of the game mechanics are a little wonky, but that just makes the game more enjoyable right? Also to mention, please check out the screenshots before hand, I don't see why people complain if they don't fully check out the product. Would you purchase a new computer without checking out the specifications? I certainly would not. So why be too myopic to glance at the entirety of the game. I personally thought this game was quite enjoyable for $2 and I even 100% it in terms of achievements in 2.5 hours (you can do it faster if you don't screw around, but it was nice to goof off). It's a nice zombie defense game to play with friends when you want to goof off and just enjoy yourself.\n\nLastly, you will certainly enjoy this game if you have ever played the game "Box Head" as it brings back the intense moments of running for your life and wondering why you didn't purchase more ammo. Combine that with some achievements and you've got a steal deal for $2.\n\nOverall, this game was quite nice for a $2 zombie shooter, please don't expect it to be the next AAA title. Yet Another Zombie Defense brings back the feelings of "Box Head" and even throws in some achievements and inane game play for you and your friends.","May 31, 2014","true","2.9"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","46","60","0","0"

The Good.\n- lots of weapons to use, from pistols to chainsaws and tesla guns;\n- plenty of buildings from palisades to turrets and mines to place in order to help you survive - and make zombies go boom!\n- RPG elements (can pick traits to improve like reload speed, extra health, health regen, etc.)\n- resource management - money and ammunition are all important\n- 2 game modes - a strategic one, and a brutal one where surviving over 3 minutes is a success of its own\n- multiplayer with still plenty of active people online\n- The music - albeit the game has only 2 relatively short music tracks, I love them both. The Main Menu music has that ERA/Enigma vibe, and the combat (level) music is heavy metal kind of the XBlades 1 type.\n\n2. The Bad.\n- repetitive\n- only 1 map\n- only 2 music tracks\n\nThe Conclusion:\n\nAn amazingly good game for 49 cents in my opinion, perfect to fool around with to relax and break the everyday tedium, or as a nice filler between your crazy good AAA games. Even if you're a huge cheapskate and think that 49 cents is still money, deduct 24-30 cents from the steam trading cards that you will sell and you get a perfectly fine SP/MP experience for just 19 cents. That's cheaper than a chewing gum, for God's sake.

The objective is very clear: defend yourself against ever increasing hordes of attacting zombies (hey - that's in the title!). So I went into it, as in quite some of these small and cheap games, I do admit, for the trading cards, and since I love games with Steam achievements. During the first encounters things got on in a rather predictable way. I managed to survive several waves of attack circling around a single lamp-post with nothing but darkness surrounding me. There was the ability to buy new weapons and ammo in between the rounds, but no upgrade possibilities for the weapons, to name but one thing.\n\nAlso, I could place some fences, but that produced a rather weird result, since the fences can't be turned around so stand as soldiers in a row awaiting the onslaught. And slaughtered I got, out there on my own in the darkness.\n\nThis morning, I decided to give the multiplayer co-op a go, and made my game open to anyone who wanted to drop in or out. And that made quite a difference: people came and went, staying for some seconds or longer, and suddenly it proved to be quite some fun to blast away at those pesky zombies. I do have to admit I find it difficult to watch other players jumping around like grasshoppers on speed - be a man, stand your ground and shoot!!\n\nAll in all, a small diversion for the dead moments in between the more serious games, but hey, this game didn't pretend pretend to be anything more than just that.\n\nUPDATE - August 2015\nAfter coming back to this game after a year, I have to say the developers polished it nicely since then, adding some more interesting weapons and most importanly: zombies can drop extra powers for the player, such as invisibility or invulnerability. These help a lot and make the game more enjoyable. I was pretty impressed that multiplayer still seems alive, and I enjoyed hunting for some more achievements.\n\nRecommended: unpretentious but well-made game with some challenging achievements","August 8, 2014","true","5.1"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/recommended/270550/","ultanium","Ult","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/","409 products in account","Yet ANOTHER zombie defense is a decent entry in the zombie/survival genre despite the over-saturation of zombie games in recent years.\n\nSTORY & GAMEPLAY\nChoosing one of three characters, you must survive for as long as possible by constructing and buying resources by day and defending by night either alone, or with friends and strangers up to four players.\n\nThe game presents you with an assortment of weapons and accessories to aid you in your zombie slaughter. Ideally in zombie shooters the most expensive weapon is the most effective. That concept is no different on Yet Another Zombie Defense: Expensive = Effective. You can either buy weapons during day break at full price, or wait for a discounted sale to hit in later days. You will burn through money fast; therefore sales provide you with an option to cash in on low-price gear. You can effectively create your own “safe zone” through the use of auto-turrets and two variants of palisade walls: Wood and steel - the latter being more durable to zombie attacks. You can have all sorts of combinations, though their effectiveness will be tested in combat.\n\nThe online portion works just as well as the single player with a drop in/drop out feature. I had some lag drops here and there, even during my own hosted lobbies though not too often that would ruin the overall experience. Players can communicate via the in-game chat box and host is able to kick players who are otherwise trolling or lack contribution. From the several games I played the community is rather active, friendly and helpful which is a major plus.\n\nThe current offering is satisfying, though for a limited time. The game lacks weapon/fortification upgrades and variation in terms of maps. Once you breach wave 20 you will stop and question whether it is possible to progress any further as zombies become ridiculously over-powered in terms of speed, durability and damage. Future updates are promised by the developer (most recent being 14 August 2014) possibly free of charge, therefore it would be nice to introduce additional features to build on the current game.\n\nI only played this game with an Xbox controller, therefore cannot comment on the functionality of keyboard and mouse. Xbox controls handled well without any problems.\n\nGRAPHICS / ART STYLE\nAesthetically nothing impressive. The character and zombie models are almost identical to those in Garry’s Mod. Delivers an entertaining game of mindless zombie killing.\n\nAUDIO\nBetween 4-5 different tracks; nothing major in terms of variety. Some sound effects were off-sync – i.e weapon shots and zombie growls.\n\nOVERALL\nA fun but limited zombie shooter with a not-so-ridiculous price tag. In dire need of additional content to bolster its current offerings.\n\nPROS\n+Two modes which can be played alone or co-op + supported by leaderboards.\n+Nice assortment of weapons and tools to change gameplay.\n+Ridiculously cheap.\n+Developer is opposed to the idea of charging players for additional content (DLC).\n\nCONS\n-In dire need of additional content – especially map variations.\n-Unexplainable lag in single player and online.\n-Some sound effects off-sync.","November 23, 2014","true","10.1"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","24","33","4","5"

If you are someone who lies really cheap games, I wouldn't hesitate if this game went on sale (Its cheap enough as it is anyways).  The gameplay is very simple-it consistes of you (single player) or other players (multiplayer) being surrounded on all sides by zombies.  Like the many games that came before it, each level brings ore zombies as well as more powerful zombies.  After each round, you can place turrets, barracades, or purchase guns.\n\nPros:\nMusic-It was the first thing I noticed when entering the game.  It kind of reminds me of the music from Kingdom Hearts when you are going through the tutorial.\nTurrets- What I though was cool about the turret system was that you buy a seperate gun for each indiviudal turret, and you have to buy ammo for them.  In similiar games, the turret already came with a gun.  I like this aspect because it lets you decide what to do with each turret.  (In the multiplayer game I was in, we put pistols on them because they are the cheapest weapon and the ammo is free.)\nMultiplayer-This is by far the best part of the game.  My first multiplayer game was with some of the top players (Given this is the release day).  They were very friendly and we made it quite far before the host had to leave thus ending the game.\n\nNeutral:\nGunplay-I like the look of the guns and the musslefire.  But, the major downfall is that the shotgun packs little to no punch and the flamethrower is god aweful.  The other guns are fine.  Overall, I wasn't too satisfied with the gunplay.\n\nCons:\nGraphics-It didn't really bother me that much, I'm not a very picky person when it comes top graphics.  I consider them to be par.\nLevel(s)-There is only one level.  It is very simple with one lightpost in the center.  You can see so in the screenshots.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion:\nThe game was enjoyable and the price point is completely reasonable.  Its not a groundbreaking game, the title speaks for itself on that one.  Its simple, yet fun to play for a little while.","March 28, 2014","true","0.5"," 138 of 242 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","138","242","0","6"

I can't really say much about this game, but I guess I'll start at the price. This game is quite affordable at the price of £1.59, although I got this in a sale for £0.39, and I'd say that it's most likely worth it. The game's design isn't unique or out of the norm, but it doesn't go to say that it's a bad game, at all. The zombies work well and don't bug from my experiences so far, nor do the items for sale (guns, barricades, turrets, etc). However, there was an issue that happened to me a few times, and really annoyed me. After 'daytime', when the night starts and swarms of zombies attack, occasionally your character would not be able to move or equip any weapons other than the starter weapon, the pistol. Only being able to use the starter gun and look around isn't good, especially if you've progressed really far by yourself; just a side note, the map isn't really that large. I'd love to see a new map added that was much larger and had run down buildings in which you could put turrets in.\n\nThe Co-Op is good. There's Multiplayer, Singleplayer and Local Co-Op, the Steam Trading Cards, Leaderboards and Full Controller support add to why I believe this game is good. There are 3 Characters, the 'SWAT', 'Boy' and 'Girl', which aren't too imaginative and do not have any personalities. There aren't many online lobbies, but playing with friends or hosting a lobby is still pretty fun. To add to that, there are 3 game modes, all of which I like.\n\nI'd recommend this for people looking for a quick game to pick up and play; like I previously said, there's not a whole lot to say about this game, it's not bad, but it doesn't stand out well. I enjoyed playing this game myself and would recommend this game to those considering buying it.","May 13","true","3.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It is indeed a zombie tower defense in which you have to survive as long as you can, you can get money and with that money you can buy guns or stuff you will need for survive the hardest nights. Also, you can get upgrades that will make stronger, faster, etc.\nThe game itself is not bad, if offers a good time with your friends and it also have different games modes. Also it offers archievements and trading cards\nI have a few problems with this game though, it can get a little repetitive, since the game is too simple there is no a high replay value, once you unlock every archievement is pretty much over.\nAnother thing is, I personally don't enjoy playing solo as much when I was playing co op. I feel like the fun in the game comes from the co op experience. Don't get me wrong, I know there are plenty of people who enjoy the solo experience in this game, is just not for me.\n\nSo, for the final question "Do you recommend this game?" Yes, yes I do, the game offers a funny co op experience and you can try to unlock every archievement, but I think you should have a friend to play with.\nMy score 7/10.\n","January 13","true","14.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The goal is to survive hordes of zombies trying to kill you and you have some variety of weapons and defenses to help you.\n\nThere are two game modes, Defense and Endless Night.\n\nDefense\n\nFirst of all you can choose to play solo or allow others to join you when choosing this game mode or you can choose to find a game hosted by another player. Playing with others does help survivability however only the host can buy items such as walls, weapons, turrets and ammo.\n\nYou start with only a pistol to defend yourself and earn $ by killing zombies. You can buy weapons, walls and even turrets which can have any weapon mounted on them as you see fit. You do need to make sure that you buy ammo for all of the guns that are in use however because turrets will be useless if they are not shooting because of ammo shortages. In the later levels repairing walls and resupplying ammo can start to get very expensive since the zombies also progressively get faster, tougher and stronger.\n\nThe area you have to build is a little smaller than the edge of the map where the zombies will be spawning and you have a single lamppost in the center of the map providing some light. The very edge of the map is an invisible barrier and zombies will just spawn instantly so can occasionally block you if you happen to be running the edge of the map.\n\nLastly the items that you can buy to help your survivability sometimes can be bought slightly cheaper because they go 'on sale' which can be helpful but sometimes it can take a while for them to do so, in which case it might be more viable to buy them at their full prices.\n\nEndless Night Mode\n\nIn this mode you can also choose to play solo or allow others to join you when choosing this game mode or you can choose to find a game hosted by another player. Again playing with others can help survivability but in this mode you cannot build defenses, you can only run around so make sure not to run into each other with a horde of zombies either side of you and get trapped!\n\nThis game mode runs 'endlessly' until you die, there is no daytime in which you can buy weapons or defenses or ammo, there is just one single night that lasts until you die. You can however pick up weapons dropped by zombies upon their death but the ammo is very limited for these so you will run out and your pistol (which has infinite ammo) will be pulled out again.\n\nOverall\n\nGreat game for only £0.39 that i bought it for, does have achievements that took me only 5 hours to achieve but its a very simple fun game and for that price you can not go wrong!\n\nFor reviewing completeness the game does also have Steam Badges if you are interested in those too!","May 17, 2015","true","5.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Play with friends to experience more fun!\n\nEnough with promotional marketing lets get to the deeds.\n\nPros: You and your friends can team up in 2 game modes to survive the onslaught of zombie attacks together. Or if your a lone ranger type of person you can baracade yourself into a nice cubby hole lol.\n\nWeapons:\nAutogun, I haven't got this thing to work so I can't realy give good input on it yet.\n\nPistol *starting gun* infinite ammo to help you survive the first few waves untill you can get new stuff.\n\nSMG, now this thing won't protect you from a charging zombie horde but it will suffice in the beginning waves of enemies.\n\nSHOTGUN, the shotgun will be your very best friend up untill wave 12 -14 then it does feel a little bit weak but its a lovely firearm that will ensure your survival through the waves of zombies.\n\nFlamethrower, It seems pretty decent for what it is just make sure to have enough ammo / gas or else you will have some problems.\n\nAssault Rifle, I do enjoy this weapon alot it is one of the more useful weapons available.\n\nSniper Rifle, yes yes and more yes. The sniper is just like it should be a weapon in which the bullet has enough velocity to pass through and kill enemies behind the initial target. There is also a achievment to unlock which is kill 8 zombies with 1 bullet. Gives a nice challenge to the game not a big one but a fun challenge.\n\nRocket launcher, this is my boomstick and it is used to keep my butt out of bad situations. Very useful when being surrounded by multiple zombies and is quite enjoyable to shoot aswell.\n\nTesla rifle, this thing is a blast *no pun intended*. When you get enough cash you'll want to try this gun out for sure.\n\nLazor, Its alright in short. If you wanna try it go for it but the tesla rifle would probably be your best bet if your going for a higher damage weapon.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCONS: I don't see alot of problems with the game performance wise.\nNeeds more guns or a upgrading system to make your current shotgun more powerful.\nFew more maps would be nice.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFor the price it is $1.99 your getting a pretty fun game. With the Winter sale going on you can get this for $0.67 which in my personal opinion its worth it. If the game gets more support who knows the devs might update it wqith more content.\n\n\nTo the Devs you have a great product going for you right now i'm enjoying this  game and I will be purchasing some more games to giveaway on my twitch channel.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 I'd put this game at 9.5 its a good little game and all the more fun with some friends.","December 19, 2014","true","6.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The name of the game and it's very cheap\n.) Very simple to understand and made for everyone\n.) I would classify the game as a Zombie, CO-OP & Top-Down Shooter\n.) Wave-based with growing difficulty every round\n.) Has an own shop, where you can spend your earned money from the past rounds on new weapons, ammo,                                  barricades and automatic turrets\n.) Co-op Mode\n\nAll in all i would say it's one of the best casual-Co-op-Games out there in the wide world of Steam. One thing I really hate about the game is the very little choice of placeable items. I would like to see more items for base building, but maybe that's going to be changed in the future. well done Awesome Game Studios, the game has potential for more!\n\n8.5/10 Duck-Points\n\n\nSincerly,\nthe friendly duck from the neighborhood","August 2, 2014","true","3.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The actual gameplay is solid enough, and actually feels cleaner than some other isometric arcade shooters I've played (more expensive ones to boot). The survival aspect isn't bad, since you actually do have to utilize barricades and whatnot if you want to survive at later levels, because zombies increasingly become faster, stronger, and more durable. At first you can just kite the circular play area and the few zombies who decide to run faster towards you can be taken care of easily, while you outrun the rest and pick them off later. Further on, though, when the zombies all have high speed levels, you can't outrun them for long, and you have to either kill the quick moving ones immediately, or use barricades to hold them off and survive.\n\nFor the asking price (dirt cheap, or free in a past free Indie Royale Bundle), it's actually a really clean feeling game. It's just lacking in depth and variation. The developer is always asking for feedback on the game, suggestions, etc, and says he'll add more upgrades, game modes, etc if there's enough interest.\n\nEveryone was bashing this dev, but to be honest, he's doing things the correct way. He didn't bite off more than he could chew, he made a simple, playable game with good fundamentals and nice clean graphics, and will add to it from there. Much better than so many other indie devs who bite off way more than they can chew and put out a glitchy, unplayable piece of crap, or ones who make up for their lack of skill by making things too weird and 2deep4u, or getting lazy with "retro" graphics.\n\nAll in all, it's not going to blow your socks off, but if you can go find me a game for $2 MSRP that blow my socks off, well...

Let me begin by saying you do get what you pay for.  The game starts out just the same as it ends.  In what looks like a parking lot with a single lamp post, you begin to construct a very few simple structres.  By building fences and auto turrets to keep the zombies at bay as you try to stay alive as long as possible.  There is no variety of zombies and no changing of levels.  But as I said the game is only a few bucks, and if you play an hour here and even just a hour later you get your moneys worth.   I experienced no crashes, no glitches so it seems stable enough as it is simple.   While I played only a short while there is the co-op option which makes survival a bit easier, so all in all, a simple zombie defence game for a few bucks.  Money well spent.","March 29, 2014","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Basically, you are thown in with nothing but a pistol and fight off a wave of zombies. These are the nights. Then, once they're all dead, it goes into a section where you can use the cash you earned from killing zombies to purchase and build. These are the days. You can buy guns, ammo, turrets to place guns on that will shoot automatically, and walls that can be placed to help stop the incoming waves. During the night stages you can pick up drops from the zombies like ammo crates, money stacks, and full health. Health will come back between rounds, but if run out of it during the night, it's game over. The walls and guns become very necessary for later rounds as the zombies continue to increase not only in numbers, but in speed and health as well. You're going to die. It's just about how long you can survive. Eventually ammo will run out, walls will get destroyed, and you'll be overwhelmed. And that's basically the whole game. Simple, but with possibilities and strategies to try. Oh, and there's an endless mode with is similar except that... there's no day stages.\n\nThere's also mutliplayer, which is where this game really shines for me. You can play with up to three other people (meaning four players total including yourself). That means four times the firepower, and a game is only over if every member dies so... better odds. Just make sure not to get in each other's way and do your best to cooperate. Playing online is a great way to make this game more enjoyable and interesting, as you can see other people's skills and strategies. I've played much more online multiplayer with this game than single player, and it's one of the few games I actually play online anymore.\n\nI also want to mention how cool some of the other things are in this game. It has some neat music, which is nice. The way you can build walls and turrets to create a defensive outpost between rounds is a lot like a tower defense game, and it's a cool way to implement that genre into this top down twin stick shooter type of game. It's basically what I think a new arcade game would be like. I like it.\n\nBut every game has some downsides. The online can be awfully laggy at times. That can be due to distance, but... it's still a major drag since there's no local co op for this game, another downside. Also, while graphically it looks alright, artistically it is a bit drab. It's a zombie apocalypse, I get it, but that doesn't mean I have to like the dark, dirty look. Just a personal preference thing I suppose. Also, there's this weird system that allows everyone to use the money to buy things in private games with friends, but in random online matches there's no way to do so. Only the host can buy things. It works out alright, but the fact that it's inconsistent is strange to me, and not really explained anywhere either. The heads up would help. Speaking of that, it'd also be nice to get a little warning on the turrets. See, you buy the turrets from the shop and then you can place them. Pretty easy to figure out. What's confusing is that you're supposed to mount a gun on them. This could've been conveyed a little better. Many times newcomers will buy a turret and place it then be confused as to why it won't shoot. Well you have to have another gun to mount on it. And that gun also uses ammo. You start with many extra pistols to mount to them, which is nice enough, but being given a small heads up on a few of these features might have been nice little things to add. Also, there are supposedly more updates coming... but they're taking long than expected as well as longer than announced. So don't base your purchase on new features coming as it's still a bit up in the air. However, let it be noted that, at the very least, more stages to pick from would be very appreciated.\n\nIt's still a pretty fun little game. Nice for a time killer. Simple. Easy to learn. And for two bucks, it's worth it. Wait for a sale even. I got it cheaper and even I think it's worth the full price. Yet Another Zombie Defense gets a 6/10 for being a fun, simple, arcadey experience in a more modern time.","January 8, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, a game that I purchased for half a dollar is getting updates that are a sure improvement to its gameplay. A couple of months after I purchased it, the game was bestowed with many new weapons. And today with something that looks to me like some RPG elements. Love the updates, love the game! Keep the good work going on!\n\nA very good example of how a good concept can create a great game. At this price, a must have. Am looking forward to a similarly priced sequel.","October 31, 2014","true","30.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's like a basic tycoon game in which you can earn money as you kill zombies. As you progress, the zombies become stronger and more lethal. Trying to survive 10 nights might seem difficult enough, but getting at any point past night 10 is difficult if you have less than four people. Trying to get all the achievements can be a challenge and makes more goals to go after in this game. What I liked most about this game is the accessibility to auto-turrents and the ability to mount any weapon on top of them, making them fierce allies if you're able to protect them. My personal favorite weapon is the Telsa Ray, which can attack up to three zombies at once, and is basically an instant-kill gun. I love the idea of ammo sharing and whenever some gains a health pack you get some of it too. It was definitely worth the $0.69 I paid for. Even though I currently only have 2.6 hours on it, I expect to add more, seeing a this is an enjoyable game to play.\n\nSome things to know before you play:\nYou can have up to 4 people playing with you.\nYou can customize your server to personnal or to public\nThe game becomes harder as you play\nIt matters where you place everything\nThe Rocket Launcher is not a good gun\nThe auto turrents are VERY useful\nAt random nights, there are sales on various item in the store\nNever play alone\nThe street light is your friend\n\nSome thing that could be added:\nBetter assortment of weapons\nNew barricades\nPossibly new maps\nNew characters\nNew game mode (Example: A defending mode where you have to protect the street lamp from the zombies.)\nFew various tweaks on the AIs of the zombies\nVoice chat in the game\nAnd maybe a few bosses that come out each night during the horde, to add a little spice to the game!\n\nI hope this helped you and gave you a proper decision on whether to buy this game or not, but I will say this; It is defininetly worth the amount of money it is being sold for, very fun and low graphics, meaning you can have a fast gameplay on slow laptops, like mine!

This is an indie game, priced at £1 something - it's good value. Some people might moan about the graphics, the lack of scenery or story line - but  1) doesn't need  story line (It's zombies wanting to eat you - what more do you need?) 2) The singular lamp has a certain atmospheric effect that gives way to the impeding darkness. 3) It's an indie game - don't expect amazing graphics. (Not that it needs it)\n\nThis game isn't about amazing graphics, it's about survivability... and fun.\n\nIf you play this game with friends, it's an almost guarenteed laugh fest as you (probably) squelch beneath the horde of zombies.\n\nI've played this as a solo player and with friends. It's more enjoyable with friends.\n\nThe only annoying aspect of this game is that you can't keep your money or weaponary between games.","August 20, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It sure does look like there can be potential in updating the game, adding new things, weapons, modes and so on.\n\nPros:\n+Gamer's skill is rewarded\n+Simple concept\n\nCons:\n-Really laggy multiplayer online experience\n-Zombies are a mess (explained in ''DETAILS'')\n\nDETAILS:\n(I'm talking here about how things are right now in the game. It's my first encounter with this game and it's fairly new.)\n\nI see no need for animation of zombie's attack due to instant loss of health when you even touch a zombie. If the zombie hurts you without it even grasping you, there's no point for animation of it grasping; there needs some work on that.\n\nA lot of the zombies are actually faster than you which makes you to die easier considering what I said above. And yes, somebody will find this as a great challenge.\n\nThere's no option for you to set your controls to default. That's really a minor issue but I feel the need to point that out before developers make a change.","November 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/recommended/270550/","fantadidi","Fantasy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/","3018 products in account",""Yet Another Zombie Defense" is a co-op game where you and your friends have to kill zombies on a small map, that is the only point ... but that is pretty fun ! Up to 4 players can fight together, using a man, a girl or a member of the SWAT (the only difference is the skin, nothing else).\n\n\n\nThere are two modes.\n\n\nThe first one is the defense mode. You have to survive waves of zombies over and over until the end of your lives. Each time you kill a zombie, you get some dollars plus from time to time money, medic kit (enables your team to recevor health) or ammo (you need to have at least one weapon to get ammo, that does not take into account the pistol that you have at the beginning because you have infinite ammo for this specific weapon). After each wave, you recover your health but the zombies get stronger : they will deal more damage to you if they bite you, they will be faster and you will need more and more hits to kill them.\n\nIn order to survive, you are able and you have to use your money between each wave. You can buy different weapons (rifles, shotgun, flame thrower, tesla, rocket launcher, laser, ...), but always remember to have enough ammo tu use them ! Tip : I think the best way to go is to buy only one weapon so that, when a zombie drops ammo, you only get the adequate type of ammo. If you have two or more weapons, you are going to drop at random two types of ammo, and if you are looking for one specific kind, you might be unlucky and get the other one.\n\nYou can also buy barricades (wooden and steel) and auto-turrets and place them on the map, almost wherever you want within a medium circle from the center of the map. You can build up to 5 turrets, and for each of them, you have to buy and mount a weapon on it to get it active. Them, each time the turret shoots a zombie, it will use your ammo, so be carfeul with your stock ! The idea is to protect your turrets with barricades because zombies can destroy them, and since they are pretty expensive, you have to keep them alive.\n\nRemember that only the host of the game can buy stuff and place items. You can ask for specific weapons, but the host has the final decision. I think that you should spend the first four or five waves killing the zombies with your pistol (which is free thanks to inifinite ammo), then you are likely to buy the weapon you like the most. There are also "sales !" : at random, between each wave, some items are going to be cheaper (-25% I guess), so you might want to wait if you are looking for a specific item and maybe get lucky after the next wave, unless you die ...\n\nIn the end, you have to get the highest score you can to get your name on the leaderboard.\n\n\n\nThe second mode is the endless night. As indicated, there is only one wave of zombie, but there is no end to it ! No money on this map, no barricade or even turret to build, you have to kill zombies with weapons. There is a lot of zombies and they can drop weapons : as soon as you pick one of them, you have to use it, you cannot get your previous weapon back (unless you drop it again). The aim is to survive as long as possible, so try to gather medic kits when you need one of them, and never stop running !\n\n\n\nTo conclude, this game is pretty fun, maybe it is lacking a little bit of content, but with two modes, Steam trading cards and 18 achievements to unlock (5 hours should be enough to get them all), it is worth its price, which is quite low currently :)","December 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I still think this game has more potential to add some more, but don't add too much! Keep it simple, but something that could be improved is the building. The map itself is like 3 times bigger than the actual area you can build in. The idea of mounting any gun onto the turret is brilliant! More weapons, more characters, more defense!\n\nAnyways, nice game.

It's simple, yet still entertaining\nYou start with a pistol, and shoot zombies wave after wave. Not so original, but the game is very aware of that, hence the name.\n\nYou can play the game Solo, or Online up to 4-players Co-op.\nNo problems with multiplayer, works fine!\n\nAfter each wave, you can place defenses, such as barricades and turrets.\nWith some planning you can get quite far, but it does require you to try few times.\n\nAchievements are pretty easy to get, I got all 100% in few hours. Some you might get without thinking about it, but others may need few tries to get. There are steam guides for achievements, so that helps.\n\nOverall, it's fun zombie shooter which brings nothing new to the genre, but is still entertaining for few hours in small sessions. Price is low, and you can pick it up on sale for even cheaper. Definitely worth the asking price.","March 3","true","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Although a bit genuine, the defense buildup only serves to slow down the hordes and keep you pinned in a single spot trying to snipe off incoming hordes, which I found unintuitive, as it was much easier to circle strafe around the entire level while picking off the trailing hordes.\n\nThe music is awefully repetitive, but can be turned off, while the weapons lacked sonic and visual punch.

Basically you play one character in an 3rd person arena shooter where you must take on and defeat wave after wave of harder enemies.  The longer you survive the higher your score. Though unlike the excellent NR, YAZD has only one map, no perks, one type of enemy and very limited replayability.  Infact once you've made the achievements there is almost nothing to bring you back.  Except maybe getting the best score on the leaderboard.\n\nThere are three character types to choose from but none of them have any diffrenciating abilities.  Between each way you can buy new weapons to shoot down the waves of enemies.  In addition to your starting pistol these include: SMG, shotgun, flamethrower, assault rifle, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, laser and tesla coil.  These weapons can be mounted on automated turrets to increase the number of weapons firing during a wave but, at a cost.  Defensive obstacles can be brought to construct a temporary base to increase of survival.\n\nPerhaps its one true plus is the coop for up to four players but even then the session leader is the only one who purchase the weapons for the team.  Where its different from say Nation Red is that ammo must also be purchased for each weapon.  If this runs out during a wave you only have your basic pistol to rely on.  Which means almost certain death after wave 5.\n\nGameplay is very repetitive but can be fun in short bursts.  Though eventually you'll succumb to its limited capabilities and uninstall.  Be warned - Only recommended on a 75%+ discount, 90% if you can find it.","July 20, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gaining an understanding of most, if not all of the game mechanics takes less than 5 minutes.\n◦ The first few games are intense and fun.\n◦ Multiplayer is a nice feature and works(relatively) smoothly. The community seems nice enough.\n◦ Decent sound track, albeit royalty free.\n◦ A unique "sale" feature where different items are discounted every day.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n◦ The game is simple, but so much so that enjoyablitily and replayability are nonexistant. None of the features themselves are bad... it's the lack thereof.\n◦ The game gets old fast. There's no variation between save for what you do differently.\n◦ No 'special variants' of zombies. The enemies are monotonous.\n◦ No difficulty scaling based on the amount of players in game. It's virtually impossible to reach level 10 solo, but it's nearly impossible not to with three other people at your back.\n◦ No upgrades. At first glance, this may not seem like a big deal, but eventually the horde can break your steel palisades in a matter of seconds, and your laser can do nothing to stop it.\n◦ No progression. Once you die, that's it you start at square one again with nothing to show for it. There's a ranking system, but it doesn't mean a thing in the end.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n◦ Overall, the visuals are adequate. It's not disappointing but it's certainly not impressive in any sense of the word.\n◦ The setting is... Nonexistant... There's one 'map' and it's a lamp post surrounded by an expanse of concrete.\n◦ There are only three character types and no customization whatsoever.\n\n\nThe Reality\n\nThe game isn't bad by any means. I got it for 67 cents and don't regret the purchase. You get what you pay for; A couple hours of entertainment. While it's lacking in some ways, the features that are in place are, at the very least, executed well. If you're not impressed easily, there's little enjoyment to be had here, but if you're looking for some quick and inexpensive entertainment on the fly, it's definitely got you covered.","August 9, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those who want a full review, read on. Otherwise, I give the game a 9/10 for a low price and fun gameplay.\n\nI found this game randomly, saw it was 75 cents for a two pack (ON SALE), and instantly got it thinking it would be only decent, but it's actually really good! This is a very simple game, and as such it is not very difficult to learn the different mechanics. As the title may suggest, this game is about defending yourself from zombies, but it's in a third person perspective and it's done pretty well overall. This game offers two gamemodes, which are Defense and Endless Night (which can be unlocked by getting to night 7 of Defense). The 3 characters are Guy, Girl, and Swat, and they do not (as far as I've seen) have any difference between them. I think it would be cool to add some special characteristics to make the characters different; such as the Guy having more Defense, the Girl having more Speed, and the Swat having more Damage or Firing Speed. Every Night in Defense mode you can buy upgrades like fences or weapons, and so you evolve from night to night. But as expected, the zombies slowly get more challenging too. This game is a masterpiece for the asking price of as little as 50 cents for a copy, and is still fun. For those who have that little amount of money in their steam wallet, I highly recommend getting this game. It's lots of fun.\n\nYet Another Zombie Defense - 9/10","February 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I'm honest I wasn't expecting much for the mere pittance I was spending here. Regardless whether you have a money off coupon or not for this game hardly changes the fact you should still buy this game. It's fun, and I mean stupidly fun. For something so simple, so basic, it's survival at it's finest. There are no tricks, but challenges. You can try it alone or you can team up with your friends to see how many waves of the undead you can repel, whilst earning cash drops for weapon upgrades, ammo resuply, defences, and other accessories. The zombies get tougher and faster as each wave begins so some sort of strategy might be in order. Do you run circles around them, or do you just hide behind  you defences? The agony of choice.

Basically your typical zombie defense game where you survive as many waves as you can while purchasing items as you progress. I really enjoyed how easy it was to pick up, and how challenging the game gets as you go past wave 10. I would love to see more variation to the zombies, or perhaps boss-like rounds, would also love to see more content as this game could probably go stale within a week or two. If you're looking to 100% this game, it's totally doable.

Nothing beats WASD + Mouse.\n[+] Challenging. I like the idea on looting the drops manually to get cash and ammos.\n\n[] The game could use better sound effects. You don't see a quiet shotgun now do you?\n[] More content, more! Characters, zombie types, modes, the game is too small.\n\nCons:\n[-] Bugs... Sometimes, when you build a barricade the indicator disappears.\n[-] After playing a couple of hours, the game becomes repetitive and you're most likely only after the high score instead of the fun in it.\n[-] Zombies only have their offensive and defensive stats increase and increase in number when you go up a night.\n[-] It becomes " numbers > skills " when you go past wave 14. The map is crowded that if you don't build a fortress you're pretty much done and you'll need atleast 3 people too.\n[-] Shop navigation is a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n[-] Did I mention how bad the flame thrower is?\n\nThis game has potential and it's not that bad as it is now despite having more cons than pros. So, I'm recommending it.","January 25, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/recommended/270550/","yolodomo","Domo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/","623 products in account","In just the short time I played the game, I do have a few pros and cons to point out.\n\nPros: It's a fun top-down zombie shooter, especially when you can co-op with other players. Endless fun until you're dead, aim to be at the top of the leaderboards.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, there seems to be some major lag when playing with other people online. =( I think the only way this game can be enjoyable and lag-free is via LAN with some real life friends. Some other notes also, I bought the Auto Turret, thinking it's a machine gun turret that'll fire at zombies if they get too close (dunno if it can rotate 360 degrees or not, or if zombies have to be in front of it, or if it can shoot over barricades). But when I bought it, I watched as the zombies went up to it, bashing it, and destroyed it, and it never fired a single shot. =( Is there something we're supposed to do to get it working? Or is it just a broken item? Another problem also is I found the Flame Thrower to be utterly useless. Short spurt of flame, then reload. Short spurt, reload. Never seen a flame thrower with such a small capacity, and when I played one online game with this person, it was just an utterly useless weapon. The shotgun turned out to be the better option as the spread shots would hit multiple zombies better than the flame thrower (also flame thrower doesn't seem to catch zombies on fire, or you just don't see the fire animation on the zombies, so you can never tell if you got them or not).\n\nSo yea, unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros right now, as I can't think of many pros. It is fun though, and I love how it has trading cards too (selling those should cover the cost of buying my copy of the game). I hope the devs work out some bugs, and polish it up abit. After all, it's supposedly a "Zombie Defense" game, where you gotta survive, but at the same time you can build barricades and turrets, you'd think it could be a tower defense game as well. Sadly, what good is a tower defense if the tower (in this case the auto turret) doesn't even work? It's utterly pointless to even have in the game then. =-(\n\nI'd still recommend this game to friends, but only in the hopes that this game gets some free updates or even free extra content, then it'd be all worth it.\n\n*EDIT* Ha, ironic, I didn't realize it, but there was this small window still open in the backround after I had exited the game. I looked at it, and it was a thank you from the devs for playing the game. It also said if the game became popular and would earn ratings, they will include extra content free of charge, with new weapons and even game modes. That just made my day, thank you devs! =) Though I won't be editing my review on the cons till all noted issues are resolved. XD But I will recommend the game!","November 1, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/270550/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","YAZD is a very limited an simplistic game in the same mould of Nation Red.  Basically you play one character in an 3rd person arena shooter where you must take on and defeat wave after wave of harder enemies.  The longer you survive the higher your score. Though unlike the excellent NR, YAZD has only one map, no perks, one type of enemy and very limited replayability.  Infact once you've made the achievements there is almost nothing to bring you back.  Except maybe getting the best score on the leaderboard.\n\nThere are three character types to choose from but none of them have any diffrenciating abilities.  Between each way you can buy new weapons to shoot down the waves of enemies.  In addition to your starting pistol these include: SMG, shotgun, flamethrower, assault rifle, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, laser and tesla coil.  These weapons can be mounted on automated turrets to increase the number of weapons firing during a wave but, at a cost.  Defensive obstacles can be brought to construct a temporary base to increase of survival.\n\nPerhaps its one true plus is the coop for up to four players but even then the session leader is the only one who purchase the weapons for the team.  Where its different from say Nation Red is that ammo must also be purchased for each weapon.  If this runs out during a wave you only have your basic pistol to rely on.  Which means almost certain death after wave 5.\n\nGameplay is very repetitive but can be fun in short bursts.  Though eventually you'll succumb to its limited capabilities and uninstall.  Be warned - Only recommended on a 75%+ discount, 90% if you can find it.","July 20, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an overhead twin-stick shooter game where you spend each day shooting zombies who seem to have an uncanny knack for knowing where you are. The game plays on a single, large parking lot with a lone street lamp to keep you company as you gun down masses of ever-increasing zombies who become faster, stronger, and more durable with each passing day. Killing zombies provides you with funds with which to buy new guns, ammo, turrets, and fences (Who's selling these? Ah who cares).\n\nThe graphics are serviceable. They look like they were designed with the bare minimum. I haven't experienecd any slowdown, so that's a good sign. Collision detection is a little spotty, as it can be hard to tell when you get hit, and fences act a bit weird on how you can walk past them. As for the music, I hope you like combat and build phase songs because those are the only two songs you will ever hear. They're not bad, but you will almost certainly want to put on some other tunes after you've heard them a few times.\n\nEndless mode is a nice change of pace for when you get tired of the same gameplay. In it, you cannot purchase anything and must make do with random drops provided by the zombies. It's all kiting the old-fashioned way. Overall the standard game is much more satisfying to play though.\n\nThe best way to enjoy this game by far is with friends. This game was meant for co-op survival and to that end it does it very well. No matter how good you are you're going to die, as the zombies scale much faster than you. Your cash reserves are pooled together, so it's best to play with someone you can trust, as sometimes strangers are unaware of this fact and spend your cash by accident.\n\nSo the big question is, is it worth it? Yup, this is one game I can recommend even at full price, just because of how inexpensive it is. The return value in entertainment is quite good, and having friends to play it with makes it all the better. Surprisingly YAZD is updated from time to time, so it can be worth coming back to after a long hiatus to find out what's new.  I rate this game a 8.5/10 for its nice combination of affordability, multiplayer, and fun.","November 28, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game offers two types of game modes.\n\nDefense\nEndless Night\nThe basis of the first game mode Defense is to 'build your base by day and defend it by night'. This game mode is basically wave defense, every wave the zombies get faster, more health and deal more damage. This means that the standard pistol that you start off with will no longer be doing any real damage to the zombie horde. Another possible inconvenience to factor in is the lamp-post, the lamp-post is your only source of light in this game which means you will most likely be building your base around this lamp. There are 12 means of defense, these include; the wooden and steel palisades, the autoturret, pistol, SMG, Shotgun, Flamethrower, Assault rifle, Sniper rifle, Rocket launcher, Tesla coil and the Laser. Each of these weapons and defense mechanisms costs cash from which you gain killing zombies and collecting random drops off their dead bodies. All of these means of defense go on sale randomly through the waves which is quite cool, as if you are $2,000 off buying the laser and it goes on sale the wave after, you can purchase instead of going through another round without it. The cost of ammo is variable through the weapons however they generally cost $40-80 although the flame thrower is more at $200. Once again, these can go on sale and you can also loot them randomly off zombie corpses.\n\nThe other mode Endless Nights is about 'fighting zombies in never ending darkness'. In this mode the base-building and shopping element to the game is dropped, for a more shoot-em-up style of gaming. But don't worry, just because you can no longer shop for your favourite weapons, it doesn't mean that they won't drop from the zombies as they crumple to the floor. I mean, who doesn't love having a rocket launcher after thirty seconds? During this game mode you will most likely find yourself frantically running around the map trying to avoid the zombies but also trying to gun them down one-by-one. As in both game modes, there are three characters available to choose from; the guy, the girl and the swat.\n\nThe game is quite entertaining although it is best played with friends to maximize the most fun you can have with it. I have played both game modes with and without friends and they are both enjoyable. The game is a port from the Xbox 360 version and plays quite well on my system and also offers full controller support. The system requirements are also generally quite low so that is always nice to see with games. Lastly, the multiplayer is very easy and quick to set up and have others join, which is a positive due to the fact that some games these days are very difficult to set up.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes relaxing, simple and enjoyable zombie games. Although I would not recommend the game at the current price as on sale, it becomes a lot more cheaper! Depending on your region, the price for a 2-pack would be £0.49 / $0.74 / €0.49 and at this price I would immediately recommend it.","December 6, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an overhead twin-stick shooter game where you spend each day shooting zombies who seem to have an uncanny knack for knowing where you are. The game plays on a single, large parking lot with a lone street lamp to keep you company as you gun down masses of ever-increasing zombies who become faster, stronger, and more durable with each passing day. Killing zombies provides you with funds with which to buy new guns, ammo, turrets, and fences (Who's selling these? Ah who cares).\n\nThe graphics are serviceable. They look like they were designed with the bare minimum. I haven't experienecd any slowdown, so that's a good sign. Collision detection is a little spotty, as it can be hard to tell when you get hit, and fences act a bit weird on how you can walk past them. As for the music, I hope you like combat and build phase songs because those are the only two songs you will ever hear. They're not bad, but you will almost certainly want to put on some other tunes after you've heard them a few times.\n\nEndless mode is a nice change of pace for when you get tired of the same gameplay. In it, you cannot purchase anything and must make do with random drops provided by the zombies. It's all kiting the old-fashioned way. Overall the standard game is much more satisfying to play though.\n\nThe best way to enjoy this game by far is with friends. This game was meant for co-op survival and to that end it does it very well. No matter how good you are you're going to die, as the zombies scale much faster than you. Your cash reserves are pooled together, so it's best to play with someone you can trust, as sometimes strangers are unaware of this fact and spend your cash by accident.\n\nSo the big question is, is it worth it? Yup, this is one game I can recommend even at full price, just because of how inexpensive it is. The return value in entertainment is quite good, and having friends to play it with makes it all the better. Surprisingly YAZD is updated from time to time, so it can be worth coming back to after a long hiatus to find out what's new.  I rate this game a 8.5/10 for its nice combination of affordability, multiplayer, and fun.","November 28, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played 3 hours now and have unlocked 89% (16 or 18) achievements. The game is surprisingly fun and a good challenge, until you die then everything is gone and you start again. The games don't tend to last very long, about 10-15min on average until you figure out a good strategy.\n\nPlaying online with others is ok, however it is a little complicated to learn the buying system for others. Also only the host can buy, the host needs to keep ontop of keeping ammo stocked, only the host can build and mount guns to turrets and lay mines.\n\nIf you treat it like a simple challenge, the game is great. There's nothing amazing about the game, but hey its 74c for 2 copies! what can you expect!\n\nAlso! At first my game was launching using my onboard graphics rather than my Geforce video card which created some mouse lag. Go to steam library, properties of the game, find the button to view game files, rightclick on the executable and make sure it is set to launch with graphics card by default.\n\nCheers!","January 7","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I'm surprised this game isn't more popular, especially since it's so cheap. I would recommend buying this for yourself and friends because it's sometimes hard to play since not many people play. If you have your friends to play with, this would be much more fun.\n\nSum of the game Max 4 players a game\nI highly suggest getting chainsaws for everyone. They're unlimited and kill very quickly up until wave 10~. This is a great way to save money for better weapons and defense.\nCreator of a game controls all money picked up. You can click " Buy" on an item you request to have and it will say that you wish to have said item bought above your character\nGun turrets can be useful, but are weak against being attacked. Be cautious having them unprotected\nGun turrets are used by placing it and mounting it with a weapon that you have already purchased (it's unlimited ammo on turret as far as I know, with slowish fire rate?)\nCommunicate by pressing "enter"\nA great strategy is to try and group the zombies together and kill them by following the edges of the map. Upgrade movement max for this to be best so they can't hit you\nLast three weapons seem to be the best. Blaster is great but may cause lag especially with multiple people.\nI don't suggest getting the item-grabbing upgrade unless you reall need it.\nBe mindful of what weapons you purchase. The more weapons you have, the more you have to switch weapons to get to one you want sometimes which is time consuming. I typically stick with 3 weapons (chainsaw, Tesla, Blaster)\n\n\nPros: fast paced, lots of options for different strategies, simple to play, fun, nice graphics for being simple, smooth movement and shooting\n\nCons: not many people play, sometimes you freeze and can't move until you die, lag can be bad by around night 20 due to so many zombies and shooting, high rise in difficulty as you get to around 20, people don't chat and quit early, people may join your game and not agree how you spend money which may become problematic as a team\n\nSome things I wish would be changed: upgradable weapons and barriers, option to change leader, minor glitches fixed (I've experienced two so far: one where the camera will stick and won't follow your character anymore and when your character freezes at the end of a round and either won't move or shoot until you die)","January 7","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game doesnt expect you to learn some bizarre new mechanics or anything, you can just pick up and get playing.\nNow the only issues I have is that the visuals of the game at times can get very dark and I have been attacked by Zombies without realizing because of it, also the game tends to lag later on when there are lots of bodies on screen, though given the small price I'm not terribly bothered by that.\nOverall I'm glad I got this game, its nice and cheap and you get your money's worth.","December 28, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/recommended/270550/","yolodomo","Domo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/","623 products in account","In just the short time I played the game, I do have a few pros and cons to point out.\n\nPros: It's a fun top-down zombie shooter, especially when you can co-op with other players. Endless fun until you're dead, aim to be at the top of the leaderboards.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, there seems to be some major lag when playing with other people online. =( I think the only way this game can be enjoyable and lag-free is via LAN with some real life friends. Some other notes also, I bought the Auto Turret, thinking it's a machine gun turret that'll fire at zombies if they get too close (dunno if it can rotate 360 degrees or not, or if zombies have to be in front of it, or if it can shoot over barricades). But when I bought it, I watched as the zombies went up to it, bashing it, and destroyed it, and it never fired a single shot. =( Is there something we're supposed to do to get it working? Or is it just a broken item? Another problem also is I found the Flame Thrower to be utterly useless. Short spurt of flame, then reload. Short spurt, reload. Never seen a flame thrower with such a small capacity, and when I played one online game with this person, it was just an utterly useless weapon. The shotgun turned out to be the better option as the spread shots would hit multiple zombies better than the flame thrower (also flame thrower doesn't seem to catch zombies on fire, or you just don't see the fire animation on the zombies, so you can never tell if you got them or not).\n\nSo yea, unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros right now, as I can't think of many pros. It is fun though, and I love how it has trading cards too (selling those should cover the cost of buying my copy of the game). I hope the devs work out some bugs, and polish it up abit. After all, it's supposedly a "Zombie Defense" game, where you gotta survive, but at the same time you can build barricades and turrets, you'd think it could be a tower defense game as well. Sadly, what good is a tower defense if the tower (in this case the auto turret) doesn't even work? It's utterly pointless to even have in the game then. =-(\n\nI'd still recommend this game to friends, but only in the hopes that this game gets some free updates or even free extra content, then it'd be all worth it.\n\n*EDIT* Ha, ironic, I didn't realize it, but there was this small window still open in the backround after I had exited the game. I looked at it, and it was a thank you from the devs for playing the game. It also said if the game became popular and would earn ratings, they will include extra content free of charge, with new weapons and even game modes. That just made my day, thank you devs! =) Though I won't be editing my review on the cons till all noted issues are resolved. XD But I will recommend the game!","November 1, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played 3 hours now and have unlocked 89% (16 or 18) achievements. The game is surprisingly fun and a good challenge, until you die then everything is gone and you start again. The games don't tend to last very long, about 10-15min on average until you figure out a good strategy.\n\nPlaying online with others is ok, however it is a little complicated to learn the buying system for others. Also only the host can buy, the host needs to keep ontop of keeping ammo stocked, only the host can build and mount guns to turrets and lay mines.\n\nIf you treat it like a simple challenge, the game is great. There's nothing amazing about the game, but hey its 74c for 2 copies! what can you expect!\n\nAlso! At first my game was launching using my onboard graphics rather than my Geforce video card which created some mouse lag. Go to steam library, properties of the game, find the button to view game files, rightclick on the executable and make sure it is set to launch with graphics card by default.\n\nCheers!","January 7","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

For such a low price I expected a low quality game with no longevity whatsoever. Granted, I still think it may not provide the longevity some gamers long for(IT DOES HAVE REPLAY VALUE, but it is definitely fun.\nA simple zombie defense game, that doesn't require any additional effort to play online(like downloading Hamachi).\n\nPros:\n-Few noticeable bugs(other than wanky character models)\n-Easy to host, connect, and randomly join your friends or random people\n-Can be played casually, but has a rather large skill gap because of the room for strategic play(That's a biggie for hardcore gamers)\n-Very simple concept\n-Easy to get into\n-Very little PC power needed to run\n-Promotes cooperative play\n-Replay value\n-No additional effort for connecting to players\n\nCons:\n-Inconsiderate, inept, worthless, wastes of oxygen(Scrub hosts).\n-When playing online, all the money is shared amongst everyone, but only host can spend it, so that tends to result in\ngreedy misfortune\n-There is no host migration feature(If the player hosting quits, the entire game ends)\n-Does not promote playing with randoms\n-There is a grace period between each zombie wave(which is nice), but if the host doesn't want a break, he gets to skip\nthe entire grace period. Not only that but there is a very small respawn delay for the zombies, so if you have the\nmisfortune of scrub-based matchmaking, you will not get a grace period(no time to speak in chat with other players)\n\nOverall, it is a great game, and for a low price, you can go sell a few trading cards and come back for it.\nI do highly recommend this game only if you play solo, with friends, or happen to find decent competent people.\n\nThank you for reading, have a great life.","January 9","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played 3 hours now and have unlocked 89% (16 or 18) achievements. The game is surprisingly fun and a good challenge, until you die then everything is gone and you start again. The games don't tend to last very long, about 10-15min on average until you figure out a good strategy.\n\nPlaying online with others is ok, however it is a little complicated to learn the buying system for others. Also only the host can buy, the host needs to keep ontop of keeping ammo stocked, only the host can build and mount guns to turrets and lay mines.\n\nIf you treat it like a simple challenge, the game is great. There's nothing amazing about the game, but hey its 74c for 2 copies! what can you expect!\n\nAlso! At first my game was launching using my onboard graphics rather than my Geforce video card which created some mouse lag. Go to steam library, properties of the game, find the button to view game files, rightclick on the executable and make sure it is set to launch with graphics card by default.\n\nCheers!","January 7","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Excellent game!\n4 player Co-op\neasy to get started\nskills\nguns to buy\nwalls to build\nturrets to place\n\nAfter 3 hours playing other games like rust and feeling like it wasnt even enjoyable, friends and I sat staring at the steam store looking, hoping to find a co-op game we somehow missed. Then Another Zombie Defense appeared. Could it be? a Good Co-op game?\n\nalmost 3 more hours went past in a blaze of gunfire we had got more enjoyment for our money out of this simple but well designed game than something priced at 30 dollars USD all for the Refreshingly honest price of 2 dollars USD.\n\nthe game plays very similar to the loved Boxhead2 flash game\nWorth your money!

Each kill you earn is money in your pocket, and they regularly drop pick-ups from ammo, limited power-ups, and bonus cash. After each wave you have the chance to build barricades, guns, or turrets to mount guns. After a certain amount of kills, the player can choose from a tier list of upgrades including but not limited to: Reload Speed, Run Speed, Health Regen. After beating a minimum of 7 waves, the player can now play endless night mode in which the entire game is spent during the zombie phase and you progress by picking up weapons the zombies drop and pray to God you won't die.\n\nThe difficulty in this game is incredibly high. Getting passed early waves is easy but your choice in purchases will impact how far you can get in the long wrong. There's a limit to the amount of money you can make each round, and it's up to RNG to decide how many drops of bonus cash you can get to help buy those extra barricades or that final turret. The micromanagement of your cash is probably the most engaging part of the game, but as most defence games work this way this becomes an incredibly fun part about the game. Zombies have a one track mind and will do everything they can to get their hands on you, and their spawns are quite methodical as they will appear to surround you within a second with only one way out. It's very bullet-hell-ish.\n\nThe Multiplayer aspect of the game is spot-on and has virtually no issues other than minor connectivity problems that seldom appear.\n\n\n-Sound 5/10 (Average)\n\nThe audio in this game is quite cheap. The song that plays on loop is bland, landing itself on the sweet spot of, "This is a constant loop but it's not annoying so I can tune it out white noise." The weapon sounds feel like an after thought, like the developers forgot that they needed sound the entire time and made quick sounds, leveled them so they weren't abnoxiously loud, and then released the product a little early. However, like the music, they're on a sweet spot of comfortable absence.\n\n\n\nFINAL SCORE........... 7/10 (Good)\n\n__________________________________________\n\nRating System:\n10 - Fantastic\n9 - Great\n8 - Very Good\n7 - Good\n6 - Fine\n5 - Average\n4 - Bad\n3 - Very Bad\n2 - Horrible\n1 - Apalling","October 3, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The entire game is based around killing waves of zombies.\n\nIn between the waves of zombies you can build fortifications and have turrets, as well buy new weapons. I have yet to do that.\n\nThis game is extremely fun and is casual gamer friendly. It is fun and is a difficult game. Since I enjoy just collecting Steam Achievements I have been trying for my first 2 hours of play to survive past night six without buying anything. I have yet to get this achievement. You learn how the zombies move and how the herd moves.\n\nIt really is an awesome game. Even though I do not hate DLC's as much as the devs do. I bought the game with a steam coupon I recieved after making a badge. With the coupon I only paid .20 for it. I honestly would buy this game at full price, it is well worth the $2.00 and is a nice little time killer when you want to just shoot pixels and survive a Zombie Herd.\n\nI actually do not like tower defense games, but I like this one.

Hey, kids, want to play a game where each of the 60 on-screen zombies take a whole assault rifle clip to kill? Where the basic weapons are vastly more effective than the advanced ones? Well, you're in luck, because this game exists.\n\nIn a nutshell: If you're looking for something to tie into a drinking game at your next LAN party, you might get a few kicks from this. Otherwise, you're looking at 20-30 minutes of entertainment for your 2$. It could be fun with weaker zombies, and with more weapons and features, but if you just -really- need your zombie survival fix, go play Unturned instead.","September 19, 2014","false","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yep, should be enough to get you goin and buy this game.\n\nBut well, heres what I experienced.\n\n\nGameplay\nShooting feels very smooth, zeds get fast very strong and you need to get the best weapons asap. You can put every weapon on your turrets so there are a lot of combinations to experiment.\n\nThe walking animation of the playable survivors look a bit...strange. The legs are swinging around in the air like you are swimming, no idea.\n\nMultiplayer\nSorry but no matter what game I join, I have such incredible lags that its basically unplayable.\n\nEndless Mode\nSo there was a patch recently adding a new gamemode called endless.\n\nToo bad something went incredibly wrong with this mode, since it doesnt make any sense to shoot at the zeds, they spawn endless and you wont be able to pick up the loot they drop because else you will die.\n\nWhen you play the endless mode it will look like this: You run around in a circle kiting the zeds around at the edge of the map trying to not get sandwiched. Shooting doesnt make any sense. Im not sure if this is the mode we want to play...\n\nDont know how endlessmode looks in multiplayer, but at least thats what you get in SP.","October 29, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you dont like it, life goes on. If you enjoy it like me then we can all enjoy playing together and wait for future updates that will include new weapons, bock things and maybe different game modes. I enjoy this game and rate it 8/10 There could be more options and i felt the game fell a bit short with the audio.

It also has achievements and trading cards.\n-About the community:\nThe community is big, not very big, but has enough people playing the game. And the greates thing is that you can post new improvements you want in the game, on the forums. The developer (a very nice guy) is reading them and responding about what he will add in the game. The developer is constantly making updates. So feel free to post new ideas!\n-About the guys who reviewed this as a crap game:\nGuys, you'll find out this will become a great game. More graphic options, weapons, characters, maps will be added soon.\n\nJust buy this game and have fun! You can enter the forums and find some nice guys to play with in Co-op mode.

With the current defense placement system, it can be extremely tedious to add and remove defenses while still retaining your sanity. Also, because the bodies don't disapear until the next wave, the game sometimes lags once you get to the point where you have 100s of bodies on the screen at one time. If the way you place defenses gets tweaked and the bodies fade away after they die it would be perfect.","June 22, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now, this is being said in consideration that this is an indie game, meaining it won't have as good graphics, it may not have original sounds or even soundtracks, and it just overall won't be that one game you always play (sometimes). YAZD however, does not in my opinion fall into the last critique.\n\nThe gameplay, the bread of the entire indie sandwich, is very straightforward and easy to get used to. You move around with (for gamepad users) the left stick, shoot with right trigger, and aim with right stick. Aiming is pretty on point and you hit your target 98 times out of 100.\n\nThe sounds should be split into two categories: sound effects and soundtracks. The sound effects are okay, not too many of them and the ones that are there aren't the best, but keep in mind that this is an inide game, right? The actual soundtracks, the music playing as you zombie defend, is the same one every round. While in the main menu and in daytime there is a second soundtrack, but it's kind of corny with the same "Darkness... is coming..." opreatic repeated over and over.\n\nThere is no dlc for this game, meaning when you buy it for $1.99 (or 49 cents, the price i got on sale) you're buying the whole thing. You won't need to drop another 30 dollars on in game currency or costumes of maps - which, and i need to say this, there is only one map, for day and night time. It's a concrete lot with a single street light in the middle.\n\nAll in all you won't really be wasting your money on this game. It's very addictive and fun to play with friends, especially those who enjoy zombie defense games. It runs very well on a computer like mine, which has an okay graphics card and a processor with two CPUs. YAZD is not the finest game of it's kind, but it's still a fun and worth it's price (even more for sale price) game to grab any day. Get a two pack next time you see it on sale and enjoy it with your best friend :P","June 29, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
