It doesm't SEEM finished because the story it very weak and the game itself is incredibly repetitive.\n\nThe best description of the gameplay is a very bad copy of the combat system in Endless Space, but you can never retreat after a battle starts.\n\nI am sorry devs but it feels as if I have wasted 10$ and 2 hours of my life. It is rather like watching a bad movie in the theater.","December 5, 2015","false","2.1"," 124 of 160 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","124","160","10","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/420270/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3528 products in account","In this game, a type of miasma that wiped out earth has created a destructive field you are searching to find out clues as to why it's spreading.  You will be tasked with building a fleet to discover what is going on.  You will need to gather resources and use them to open new technologies and then can study and add various parts to your ships as you continue along.  There are various factions that you will need to pick and choose between, as you will be pitted against others by working with or choosing not to work with them during your main questline.  I have not found a whole lot of significance in picking or not picking one over another so far, but I am not very far into the story itself, so I am not sure what effects this might have later on.\n\nThe plot itself takes place in space, and the visual style is very appealing, I think.  I also find the music to be very relaxing and not too overly annoying, even after listening to it for long periods of time.  Some game music will grate on me after a while and I start to notice it too much, but this one is fine so far for me personally.  Anyway, as you move forward and investigate various plot elements, you will be presented with dialogue and choices, which will advance it further along.\nThe key is to find a balance between the ships in your fleet, returning to base periodically as you gather more resources to further enhance your current build as you progress through the storyline.  The mass of various types of ships, and what classes of weapons or equipment that can or cannot be added will determine what roles your ships will likely fill, and as you unlock more technology, you will start to get a better idea of what kind of build fits what you're trying to do.  Again, I will emphasize, the key is finding the balance you want, and keeping the fuel levels adequate, while dealing with random buffs and debuffs that happen as small events during your travels in space, which I really enjoy.  I have not been able to find any way to save ships if you don't want them to be actively in your fleet.  You have to remove their equipment/weapons and dismantle them from what I can tell, but it would be nice if they could add a feature to save ships if you wanted to use alternative formations.\n\nThe battle system is not too overly fancy, but the way in which you can use various weapons and ship builds to engage in combat is an interesting aspect to the game.  You can set individual ships strategies to be more balanced, or offensive or defensive, depending on what their strengths and weaknesses are.  You can choose to let the battles happen on their own at a faster rate with the Auto button on the right side, but I have found it difficult to play with the auto battle settings on so far.  The AI doesn't seem to work as well as if you manually battle, so I end up trying to toggle between speeding it up on auto during the opponent's turn, and going to manual before my attacks.  It would be nice if there was a way to set up and customize how your AI fights battles in a general sort of way, prioritizing certain attack patterns or strategies.\n\nOne thing I do not like about the battle system is that each turn takes a bit too long it seems, in my opinion.  After you select an attack, the speed and wait between attacks beginning and ending is a bit too long.  I am not sure if there is any way to make this faster, but I've found no option as of yet.  Another thing about combat I think should be fixed: if you pick an attack in manual mode and switch to auto before the attack actually happens, the move will cancel out, and it will pick its own attack sequence.  I find this a bit problematic if I hit the auto button too fast on my last attack of a sequence, and hope this can be fixed at a later time.\n\nThe weapons can have varying effectiveness as well, depending on type.  Most direct hull (ship's HP) damage weaponry is shorter range, in general, so you will likely have to take out the front line of ships first, and then the bigger support and defensive ones after.  You can attack the hull directly, which will mainly go after the shields, depending on the type of weapons used, or try to lower the numbers on individual parts of the ship you target.  Lowering the shields first will help most of the conventional weaponry to take off bigger numbers to individual parts of the ship, and I have found taking out the armor to generally be the most effective way to eliminate a ship from the battlefield.\n\nEach turn, you can attack or defend, and weapons consume power every turn.  This is alleviated by either waiting in defense mode each turn, or using support ships to give energy to other ships when they are too low to use various attacks or skills on their given turns.  I really like the resource gathering system in the game, and gaining new tech as I go.  Each battle yields a little of each of the types of resources, and once you have ships in your fleet capable of using probes, you can try to scavenge planet bases, as well as directly salvaging materials from the planet itself to gain even more resources.  If you run out, you can simply go to another planet and return and this will replenish your probes.  Returning to base will accomplish the same thing, restoring your fleet completely back to normal.\n\nThis is great to do in the side quest mode, which you can basically use as a sandbox mode to gather as much as you want, while fighting battles as you go.  I have had a glitch happen as well to one of my ships where the power was stuck below a certain amount, so I could not attack, and I had to return to base and remove its equipment and then re-equip it all in order to get the number to return back to its normal amount.\n\n\nThe missions seem rather simplistic, and in a lot of ways I think this is a good thing.  I like the dialogue that is involved, .  It is nice you can go back to previous acts if the new ones seem to be overly tough.  I've spent the majority of my time so far in free roam gathering resources so far, and this aspect of the game is quite addictive, in my opinion, and I'm having a lot of fun learning new technologies, and collecting resources to learn the various blueprints and then add them to ships.  You can also create an extended version of the blueprint, raising the stats of each type of number, but at a cost of more mass.  There are various types of equipments to increase aspects of the ship such as hull, mass, power, etc.\n\nIn summary: The game is surprisingly fun, not too flashy, and visually appealing.  The music is a plus, since it is subtle and relaxing, and for me it fits in with the rest of the game well.  The basic gathering aspect is highly addictive and fun, and the progression is a bit slow, I think.  It seems to speed up as you hit new acts though, as the need for more resources continues to increase.  I enjoy researching new tech, and it's quite rewarding unlocking new ships and weapon and equipment blueprints.  I would like to see the battles go by a little faster at times though, and your AI be a little bit smarter about how to attack the enemy fleets.  You can gather in side missions until you are ready to move forward, so you can pace yourself in a non-linear way.  I'd love to have more options in prioritizing the AI during the auto battles, and/or have ways to speed up manual battling.  I'd also love to see a hangar feature implemented to save ships you may not actively want in your fleet instead of having no choice but to dismantle them.  A couple of possible bugs are the regenerating probes, and the one ship's power number getting stuck where I could no longer attack.  Another possible bug is the cancellation of the manual attack if you switch back to auto mode before it has gotten to a certain point in the attack phase.\n\nI give this a solid 8.5/10 out of what I've played so far.  Great game!","December 20, 2015","true","21.9"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","46","56","0","2"

No. a neutral review would be in order if it could be possible but this game just doesnt have much reason to be positively praised either. Terrible UI (you really need to put some effort into learning what is what - there are no tooltips or anything. Read the few guides that exist!). Weird mission system. Stranger than stranger colony management.  No information on enemy movement. you basically just try to grab as much as you can and survive by beating up weaker fleets with stronger or optimized ships. Meanwhile killer enemy fleets grab your colonies - and you can either go there and take them back - or hit into a massive armada and be forced to watch it get trashed until you can reload. Ditto for putting your nose too close to enemy colonies.  Eventually the repeating tasks you do gets tiring as there is too much guesswork on what to do next. On a positive side you can move around pretty freely and collect resources as you see fit. Luckily so because tight time limits would be absolute killer for this game due to little information on what needs to be done or where you are lacking vs. enemy factions.\n\nSo in the end i give this a Negative because it doesnt give much of valueto the player. No feelings of accomplishment. It is simply too bland and competition is tough.","March 12","false","10.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

While the missions do tend to get repetitive, I find that I actually enjoy it.  The best past is unlocking new ships and tech and trying out new combinations with the resources you earn.  I also like that you can grind out enemy ships in free roam in the previous system should you find your current one too challenging.  It's not as in-depth as other space RPGs out there, but I like it for the same reason I like Sid Meier's Starships...it's relatively easy to get into after getting through a short learning curve.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hBc8catg6Y\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1QEZuPr8uY","December 8, 2015","true","14.5"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","0"

The plot in short is: people had to leave Earth because strange radiation infected the planet. This radiation started to grow and our goal is to stop this.\nThe game first been released to smartphones, but now come to the PC too. Because this at the start I haven't expected much, but the game was a surprise to me. The gameplay is simple enough, we should explore the cosmos, collecting resources, developing our own base and fleet to be strong when we fight with enemy. The ship developing is deep enough , we can upgrade the fleet in a lot of different ways depending of what tactic we want chose in a battles. Battles are turn based; if you want this to pass a little bit faster, you can choose the auto battle. Graphic is simple, but nice and easy to see through. Music is good, relaxing and not annoying. One of biggest negative in a game I think is a tutorial system. Not informative enough, forcing the player to discover stuff by trying.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+clear graphic\n+good music\n+deep ship customization\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-a tutorial system is quite weak\n-some bugs\n\nSo what I should say? This game not perfect, but good enough. If you like the 4X Sci-Fi games, I think you should try this one. The game have a relaxing music, enjoyable gameplay and good customization at ships. The biggest minus the tutorial, but I think if you like that game types its shouldn’t be a big problem for you. The price for this game at the moment I think a bit high especially if you not a fan of this sort of games, but if its get good discount I think you should try this one even you're aren't too familiar with this genre.\n\n7/10","December 31, 2015","true","5.8"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","33","48","3","0"

I liked the description and the screen captures looked nice. But once you get into the game it is a nightmare. There is no real story that I have been able to find and the "tutorial" is simply some popup text bubbles pointing out what the symbols on the hub mean and then you are thrown into the game with a metaphorical "good luck a-hole" your ships slowly drift from planet to planet encountering enemies along the way to gain resources to build more ships and upgrade the ones you have.\n\nBut when you encounter an enemy it clearly shows you the enemy fleet and their combat stats but there is no option to run or opt out of the fight so if the enemy fleets stats are higher you have to sit and slowly watch your ships be torn apart turn by turn. The best you can do besides alt-f4ing out of the game is click auto in the bottom right corner but that only speeds up your destruction a small ammount and takes away any tactics you could have because the game attacks for you.\n\nAnd lastly it appears that this is an abandoned project anyway because i just tried the game again after uninstalling it a year ago (the reason I am writing this review) and not a single thing has changed.","April 6","false","25.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The first thing that caught me was the graphics, they are clean and elegant and fit the theme of the game very well. The next thing was the surprising depth of the game. You see Into the Void is a mobile app that has been ported over to the PC. Because of this I wasn't expecting much from it, having had bad experiences in the past with iOS or android ports. I doubted that a 4x style game designed for mobile could hold my attention on the PC, especially considering the user interface, which is very obviously designed for mobile, and a limited 4 sets of resources. But this game surprised me with a rather deep ship building and management system that really allows you to customize your fleet.\n\nCertainly the game's mobile roots show through, with most options being hidden over to the edges of the screen, and with buttons that are more akin to thumb or finger pressing then a mouse.  In addition the necessary simplicity does show through at times. Yet, through it all, I find myself coming back to play this game again and again, several times, despite having other games sitting in my library waiting to be played.\n\nThe biggest flaw this game has, is the monumental learning curve at the beginning of the game. The game doesn't give you much in the way of tutorial, simply describing what some options are and letting you go. But even this isn't insurmountable, and there is no punishment for replaying old missions to farm materials so that you can try out new strategies and build up your forces.\n\nIs this a perfect game? No, far from it. However it is a very good game, and well worth the price if you want a medium depth 4x sci fi romp.\n\n\nNOTE - I was given a free copy of this game in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","December 12, 2015","true","7.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

You need to constantly save your progress in order to make any progress. If  you end up running the same battle over again, you will get different results and different rewards/salvage after.  The opposing sides are unbalanced, almost immediatelly are your colonies captured and defended by battleships while you barely have battle cruisers. Resources are difficult to get, although I have a mining colony set up I have yet to see any ore created. Research is slow and the costs excalate astonimically to next to impossible levels after you  do the first tier or two.  There are random events that cause major impacts on fleet ability during mission, sometimes requiring abandoning what you set out to do.  Fuel cost are so ridiculous in some cases that even with extra fuel tanks one is forced to jump back to base when you have barely arrived in a new system. Ship design is not fully intiutive and very limited in expansion slots available on ship. Despite this the game shows some promise, but only if they fix the constant crashes and tweak the research and build costs a bit. At this time, however, I can not recommend this game to anyone for purchase.\n\n*******Update******\nThe game still suffers from huge amounts of game crashes. Play is very frustrating as often you do not have the chance to save any progres before the game crashes. The game also suffers from massive imbalance making any progress very slow due to limited resources/rewards with horrendously high costs for developing and building new tech.  Still can not recommend the game at this time, despite it's potential.\n\n****** Update******\n\nThe game is DEAD! No updates or development. Stopped playing. Devs are not doing any upgrades/support except by lip service. Game gets boring and is frustrating as very little progress can be made vs very unbalanced enemy fleets.

The UI basically leaves a lot to be desired. More visual cues (hover info) needs to be added so that players can know more about:\n- How targeting different modules are effective\n- How shield affects damage and targeting\n- Why weapons that are effectively at 0 hit point can still fire\n- How "Attack Power" (the one with the swords) should be translated with the amount of weapons/modules you have in the ship and can sometimes be confusing as you can't fire all of them at the same time due to limited energy. Seriously, this should be removed and replaced with something more meaningful.\n- More in-game tutorial pop-ups of how you should do your first research, build your first ship from scratch, your first combat, what the numbers popping up mean and how it affects your strategy.\n- How "Strategy" affects combat, and is it only affecting "Auto Combat"?\n- How much percentage of overweight affects effectiveness of combat. Some people might just want to have a heavy mule, but don't know how bad it affects combat.\n- Have a formation option for ships so that weaker ships can be protected at the rear.\n\nI'm leaving this as a Positive Review as an encouragement to the devs. Hopefully, this game can be more polished as time goes on.","March 19","true","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

You build your fleet the way you want to, having to balance performance with mass and equipment. It feels like managing a fleet of starships.\n-Learning curve. This game does not hold hands, it gives a basic explanation of the menus and what you can do on them. You have to learn the rest by the seat of your wit.\n-Humor. I've stumbled across a few jokes and references that got an honest chuckle out of me.\n\nCons:\n-Complicated. As any souls player might recognize the experience, the first time you start there is a lot of stats and you aren't quite sure what they do or how they interact. This is mitigated by time spent playing and experimentation.\n-Easy to get ahead of the diffuculty curve. It took doing all the optional missions in act one to turn everything I've done since then trivial. I'm willing to bet that scaling diffuculty up can mitigate this, but only delaying how long it takes to be OP.\n-The interface. The biggest drawback in my opinion. Likely a holdever from being a mobile game. It takes so much menu navigation to get to, well, anything, and the navigation buttons seem so far off to the edge of the screen.\n\nOverall: I like the game, and to me the pros outweigh the cons.

A great game for mobile standards, but stands out like a sore thumb amidst the other indie games developed for PC.  Scoring for this game will be based on what I expect from a PC game asking for $10.\n\nAll in all, Into the Void bites off more than it can chew and is hindered by its focus on mobile platforms rather than the PC.\n\nGameplay 2/10, lacks variation, has interesting ideas but poorly executed.The player takes the helm of their own fleet, being able to click on locations on the map to travel to different galaxies and visit planets within the solar system.  This function is somewhat similar to the Normandy in Mass Effect 2, in which the player controls a scale model of their ship from a top-down angle, navigating the map to decide where to land on.\n\nOccasionally, the player's ship will fly across hostile territory, marked with a red sonar pulse around planets.  This is when the player's fleet engages in combat.  The combat is comparable to FTL, allowing players to target different parts of the enemy ship.  After the ships exchange fire, the player is brought back to the same screen in order to select a ship to target.  If the player is victorious, he/she will be rewarded with materials and research points.  Research can be used to develop new weaponry, while the materials are used to construct the upgrades that you want to attach to your ship.\n\nFrom what I notice, crew morale can be brought down if the ship performs badly in a battle.  Unfortunately the game doesn't even provide the player with a tutorial on how to use these relatively unique game mechanics to their advantage.  I have no idea how such factors are effected, or which component of the ship I'm supposed to target to gain an edge over the enemy.  To make matters worse, I found the targeting process to be extremely time-consuming so I gave up and used the "Auto(missing: target??)" function.\n\nWhile waiting for the combat animation to finish, I had to opportunity to set off to meet the love of my life, settle down and grow extremely close to my grandchildren.  The combat animation is dull and gives the player no reason to stay seated and watch, nor does it provide any option to skip the animation entirely.\n\nThe reason why these games are more successful on a mobile platform is because it's targeted at a much more laid-back and casual crowd.  Mobile games allow for on-and-off gaming, allowing the player to put down their phone, look away and continue with their work.  If I sit down on my PC, it means I'm planning on playing a game which keeps me occupied.  It means I am dedicating my time to play the game.  Into the Void keeps the player occupied by frequently getting stuck in the combat animation as it begins to loop endlessly, with restarting the game being the only 'fix' for this issue as it forces the game to jump back to its last autosave.\n\nA chunk of the game is evidently underdeveloped or missing and navigating the god-awful UI is painstakingly inefficient and disorientating.  These buttons were obviously made for a left and right thumb, not a cursor.  Additionally, even free mobile games offer an in-depth tutorial covering all aspects of the game.  Into the Void's tutorial is poorly explained and doesn't even provide any guidance through the usage of visual pings, something which could have at least given me a basic understanding of where I should be clicking, and why.  All the confusion adds up as the player gets more lost in the game, with no idea what to do or where to go.  45 minutes into the game and I've already grown sick and tired of it.\n\nSimply put, the game just doesn't cut it for a $10 PC game and its gameplay just isn't something that PC players will find acceptable.  Honestly, the game has no reason to be ported to PC, it simply doesn't fit and there's no reason to play this game on PC instead of on mobile, which is the platform the game was developed for!\n\nStory 1/10, scrapes a point for the idea of grand space factions, but is poorly presented and unoriginal.Here's a basic rundown:  Earth is ♥♥♥♥ed, but people are still alive.  There are factions but their traits are quickly forgotten, the player is unsure of which faction he's a part of because the game simply throws all of this information at your face in a slideshow which serves as the game's prologue.  How were these factions formed?  Why have the humans been scattered across the stars, especially when an alien threat has just consumed Earth?  It's almost as if these plot points were forgotten during development and being only 45 minutes into the game, I simply forgot all about the story in my boredom.\n\nHonestly, it's a massive flop and it's been lazily presented to the player.  A failure even for a mobile game.\n\nVisuals 4/10, offensive UI, inconsistent texture quality.This game awkwardly uses the fullscreen function on the computer, and the graphics options only allow the player to choose from "high, medium and low".  No borderless windowed mode or plain windowed mode, the game is locked at fullscreen by default and intends to stay that way.  The in-game camera pans about the same angle over and over again, making it extremely annoying during the unskippable and lengthy combat animation.\n\nLimited by its nature as a mobile game and frustratingly linear camera angles, the game hurts itself by restricting the player at a certain angle, forbidding a 360-degree inspection of the admittedly detailed and well-designed ships.  This decision is confusing and I expect developers to at least modify their game to better fit the PC audience and making use of the PC's hardware.  Instead, the game just stands as a mobile game being awkwardly projected on a bigger screen, with the cursor being the only difference between the mobile version and the PC release.\n\nUltimately, the game's faults can all be blamed on its mobile-based development.  Just because a game is nice on mobile doesn't mean it's automatically worthy of a PC port, it's a sickening trend that I hope does not grow beyond controllable proportion.\n\nConclusionThe developer is on the right track to producing a proper mobile game, but the game's principle and core mechanics fail to satisfy PC users.  Into the Void is a shoddy PC port of an unfinished mobile game and I hope that eventually, Mozg labs will come to their senses and put in effort to show off their creativity by making a proper PC game.  The game does not leave a good first impression and in the end, there's no incentive to keep playing it.\n\nIn case anybody is wondering, 45 minutes were spent on the first Act.  The game repeatedly crashed on me, bugged out and the combat animations lasted up to 5 whole minutes, forcefully stretching out the playtime.  It was a painful to play and honestly, when the game already shows this many flaws within the first 30 minutes of playtime, something has to be wrong.\n\n7/30, it's game designed for the mobile platform unnecessarily ported to PC\nNOTE: This is a review for the PC port of the game, the game stands as an impressive MOBILE game packed with content.","June 5","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
