It's not bad, but at this point it's not really good either.\n5 - Mid-point. Barely passable. Barely. I can ignore it if the rest is good enough.\n[ The rest of my scale was not used, so I will not add it. ]\nWhat's important to understand is, when I judge a game, I do so taking into account *when* the game was created. Obviously, I don't expect older games to have graphics on par with resent ones, for example.\n\nPros:\n\nChallanging:\nSmart ♥♥♥ me thought to myself, "Hey, I've got about 15 years of RPG experience, I'll just go straight for 'Captain' difficulty! How bad can it be?"...\nI was an idiot. Bound by Flame, on Captain, proved to be one of the most challanging games I've ever played, by far.\nEvery enemy in this game has it's own mechanics, which encourage a different approach, and on this difficulty, every minion you encounter might be the one that will kill you.\nThis is one of those rare games where you'll find yourself saving, after defeating even the lowliest of minions.\nIt does make winning feel a whole lot greater.\n\nGraphics:\nWhile the graphics are not 'Crysis level', they are pretty good, certainly enjoyable.\n\nAudio:\nGreat soundtrack, enjoyable to the ear. Comes in complete contrast to the horrifying screams of frustration you will release.\n\nChoice:\nYou have a decision-based system here that does have an impact on the game, if not 'world-changing'.\nIt's not really like, say, Mass Effect, but it's nice.\n\nCrafting:\nThe game has a minimal crafting system, not much at all, really,  but just enough as a side-feature to support a game with other focuses.\nYou can use it to create certain consumables, as well as to break items into matirials, and use those matirials for both creating consumables, and upgrading your gear.\n\nHalf-Way-Between-Pro-And-Con:\nIt's worth mentioning that the story-line in the game is nice, I like it, but it does feel like a... Summed up version of a bigger story-line.\n\nCons:\n\nThe AI:\nThe AI that "helps" you in the fights, your partners... How do I put this... They are stupid.\nThey are beyond stupid. And mostly useless.\nThey put themselves in danger often, and can't really hold their own for very long.\n\nFighting-controls:\nThis is my one main issue with this game. The controls, at least when using a keyboard&mouse, are horrible for fighting.\nIt's not game-breaking at all, it's very duable, you just need to learn how it works, it's just very very annoying.\n\nConclusion:\nHighly recommended. Briliant game that is, without a doubt, worth a buy.\nIf you enjoy RPGs so hard you want to comete genocide, this game is for you.\n\nI hope this is helpful. I am dead tired, superbly happy after finally defeating thew last boss and finishing it, but primarily tired.\nZiv.","June 27, 2015","true","53.7"," 634 of 716 people (89%) found this review helpful 109 people found this review funny","89","634","716","109","11"

Events see you becoming the host of a demonic entity that promises you great powers if you let it take some control over you and said powers might be the only thing that'd defeat the Lords.\nWhile not an horrible game Bound by Flame is sadly plagued by several cliches in its story and characters while sporting a combat system that is a bit too clunky for the challenges you'll be facing.\n\nPROS:\n\n-most character and monster models are pretty detailed, the hero character stands out as his/her armor and weapons change depending on what you equip and what upgrades you craft\n\n-great soundtrack\n\n-if you accept its influence the gradual changes in the hero's body and voice as the demon takes over are quite interesting and well represented\n\n-lots of weapons/armor to find or buy, all of them can also be upgraded\n\n-good amount of skills/skill upgrades to choose from when you level up: you'll have three main "classes" (warrior,dual-wielding ranger and caster) and can spend points wherever you wish while freely switching between each during combat\n\nCONS:\n\n-dull story, lots of cliches in the plot\n\n-dialogues are, for the most part, just boring and drawn-out: there's also a few attempts at humour that are way out of place\n\n-companion characters are unoriginal (elf archer, somewhat evil female witch etc)\n\n-story decisions don't matter that much and you'll still be visiting the same locations with only a few quests changing slightly\n\n-world graphics are pretty average and boring, colors feel a bit washed out and lights are too harsh\n\n-animations are ok in combat but look quite wooden during cutscenes\n\n-level design is boring and uninspired, most consist of a few areas connected my corridor-like paths, there's also little in the way of embellishments leading to them looking bare\n\n-voice acting is quite weak overall\n\n-companion AI is bad, they seldom dodge and are happy to stay in AOE damage: enemy AI can also sometimes act up\n\n-combat system is decent per se, but you'll be asked to face several enemies at once and go through parries/attacks/interrupts with good timing if you want to live: sadly while the enemies attack quickly the controls don't feel responsive enough to make things work well\n\n-combat difficulty is a bit all over the place requiring silly workarounds by using the enemy AI against itself to make things easier: last boss is also laughably hard unless you use a certain strategy to beat it\n\n-little variety in enemy types and models\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=508373065\n\nBound by Flame feels like a missed opportunity to be honest as, while the premise sounds interesting, the plot itself is so similar to many other games/movies to soon become uninteresting: things are made worse when said plot is delivered by poor voice actors behind characters that are quite flat and nondescript.\n\nA generic and dull story might be forgiven if the game gave you a good time during combat but sadly it falls flat even there: you'll often face too many enemies at once and their attacks can frequently interrupt yours or stun you thus leaving you unable to defend yourself, this'll be a quick death on anything but the easiest difficulty level. Some spells or abilities also take too long to cast considering how quickly you're supposed to react, 3 seconds to cast a war cry as a warrior? No thanks.\n\nSo to make things easier you can-and it's actually encouraged- cheat the enemy AI by pulling one of a group or, if it fails, fighting a bit and then retreating until they disengage so that you can wait for health/mana to recharge and attack again. This isn't really fun and clashes with the sense of grandiose that a supposedly badass, demon-possessed hero'd be feeling.\n\nI can't recommend the game as I feel there are way better options if you're looking for a good story, good combat or both: as said it's not horrible and it works for the most part but it's so generic, dull and frustrating that even on sale I'd recommend it only for someone desperate for an action RPG fix and willing to overlook its many blemishes.","August 29, 2015","false","13.4"," 459 of 589 people (78%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","78","459","589","29","4"

This review is also available in video format below for your convenience.)\n\nDeveloper Spiders is a small studio that isn’t lacking ambition, after what was considered a major disappointment with Mars War Logs, they’ve tried yet again to craft a title whose quality is equal to its ambition with their new fantasy action RPG; Bound By Flame.\n\nSet in the kingdom of Vertiel, a region besieged by a massive undead army that’s invading from the north. A group of mages known as the Red Scribes think they’ve found a way to combat this threat and are fast at work performing a ritual. You assume the role of Vulcan, a member of the Freeborn Blades, a mercenary group that has been hired to protect the Red Scribes while they conduct their research. Things are quickly interrupted as a Deadwalker army attacks their position and amidst the carnage, something goes wrong with the ritual resulting in Vulcan becoming possessed by a Fire Demon. The Demon talks to you throughout the game, offering advice or seeking to manipulate Vulcan; ultimately playing a part in the game’s moral choices as listening to the Demon can make your character appear more demonic, bolstering magical prowess at the expense of your character’s well-being or you can choose to ignore the Demon and preserve Vulcan’s humanity. Regardless of your decision, it’s clear that Vulcan is the only one able to stand up to the Ice Lords, a group of warmongering necromancers that control the vast undead armies.\n\nUpon starting the game, you’re greeted with a brief character creation screen which only gives you a few very limited options in terms of designing your character before being awkwardly thrust into an awful tutorial section. This tutorial simply acts to highlight all of the flaws of Bound by Flame along with constant interruptions explaining the game’s various mechanics. You’ll immediately notice a lack of pacing, awkward dialogue and voice acting as well as an unmatched feeling of linearity. This leads to a very poor first impression, however gritting your teeth and pushing through this period of misery has its rewards as the game shows signs of competency later on.\n\nAfter completing the tutorial, the half-baked writing immediately improves giving rise to an interesting narrative with surprisingly strong character development. Similar to The Witcher 2 and other titles, you’re faced with moral decisions that can have an effect on the game however these changes are fairly minor comparatively but still add some elements of re-playability. The decisions aren’t cleverly thought out or morally ambiguous like The Witcher 2, instead there’s generally a clear good and evil answer. This still did well to hold my interest and watching Vulcan gradually lose his humanity in favor of becoming more demonic and powerful was a welcomed addition to the game.\n\nAlong with Vulcan, there are several companions that accompany him on his journey. These characters have been greatly improved from Mars War Logs, each having their own developed story however their proficiency in combat remains the same, often dying very quickly and doing very little to aid Vulcan. The option to romance these characters also exists depending on which gender you made Vulcan however there is little development between characters and much less chemistry making romance seem like it was only added to cover all of the features offered by superior RPGs like Mass Effect and Dragon Age.\n\nNot content to simply borrow the moral choices featured in The Witcher 2, the combat is more or less identical, with two different primary melee attacks along with traps and magic. Parrying and dodging also plays a vital role. The combat while simple is quite satisfying and requires a bit of skill and timing to master. While nowhere near on the level of Dark Souls, it’s still quite solid for an RPG. The RPG elements are surprisingly deep as well, offering three different talent trees along with an in-depth crafting system. There’s a warrior stance that has Vulcan don a 2 hand sword which boosts his parrying and defensive abilities while his ranger stance equips 2 daggers, drastically increasing his speed and stealth capabilities. The third talent tree is directly related to the Demon inside of him, which consists of boosting his magical prowess and fire abilities. Playing on the normal hawk difficulty will provide a reasonable challenge and despite being simple, the combat is definitely the highlight of the game. It isn’t without flaw though as parrying or dodging an attack perfectly will result in Vulcan performing a counter-attack which can sometimes be a detriment to dodging or running away in general. Despite this, the combat is still satisfying and I never felt bored throughout its brief campaign.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite unusual, focusing on a lot of vocal chants mixed with percussion. It still fits the game well and adds to the overall experience. The rest of the audio is hit or miss though, particularly the voice acting. Some characters play the part well, while others are abysmal. It’s hard to tell whether it’s the actor’s fault or just the writing in general as the dialogue can be laughably bad at times. It’s inconsistent in general, particularly the tutorial which almost made me stop playing the game entirely while at other times, I found the narrative, setting, and characters to be engaging. This inconsistency is even apparent in Vulcan’s personality as he can sometimes act like a jerk with no rhyme or reasoning behind it. It leads me to believe that Spiders suffers from having one or two incompetent writers or maybe it’s just a case of poor translation. If this wasn’t enough, the audio can glitch out at times, often causing characters to repeat the same line over and over again.\n\nThe visuals and environments are well done. It’s just a shame that the game is extremely linear as the many sidequests are usually confined to a small area, leaving very little room for exploration. There’s also the odd graphical glitch, such as disappearing textures and pop-in. Despite the graphical overhaul, the facial animations are on-par with Mars War Logs as characters will simply move their lips while giving a blank expressionless stare.\n\nBorrowing from The Witcher again, the game tries to separate itself into acts. Upon arriving at a new location, Vulcan will be given a host of sidequests to complete while simultaneously progressing the main story until he completes the area and moves on. Unfortunately, the game is rather short for an action RPG, running around 15 hours if you complete all of the sidequests. The poor writing rears its ugly head once more before the game's credits roll, as there’s quite a bit of buildup, and without spoiling anything, the game ends rather abruptly when there easily could have been room for another 10-20 hours of content.\n\nUltimately, Bound By Flame is greater than the sum of its parts and certainly an improvement over Mars War Logs as it features a solid narrative, refined combat system and deep RPG elements. It’s a step in the right direction, although once again a bit too ambitious a project for Spiders to handle. Although it has many flaws, it is still an enjoyable experience but let’s just hope they hire some better writers next time.\n\nThis review is also available in video format if you don’t feel like reading all of this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVo2Oc0fRGY\n\nPros\n+ Interesting Narrative & Setting\n+ Deep RPG Elements\n+ Enjoyable Combat\n+ Watching Vulcan become more demonic is great\n\n+/- Dialogue is so bad at times it’s laughable\n\nCons\n- Terrible Introduction\n- Linear & Short Length in general for an Action RPG\n- Poor Facial Animations & Voice Acting\n- Audio bugs, texture pop-in and various glitches\n- Abrupt conclusion\n- Does nothing original\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","May 15, 2014","true","21.4"," 363 of 467 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","363","467","0","10"

It's messy, clichéd and incredibly rough around the edges but after playing it for a few hours you can immediately see that for all Spiders faults this is a company that passionately loves what it does putting what resources it has to rather good use and that is part of the charm of playing a Spiders game. If you are looking for a AAA quality role playing game made on an over-inflated budget with the promise of an open world (with ironically very little to actually do) then it's probably best you look elsewhere but if you are a gamer who isn't so easily blinded by the strobe-light of the big publishing houses hype-train, enjoy a tighter more focused experience then I would encourage you to give Bound by Flame a go. You may, as I was, be in for a rather pleasant surprise.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=343035020\nTaking on the role of a mercenary in a land that is ravished by seven power hungry and greedy Ice-Lords who command an army of the undead (you will only ever encounter one of them throughout the entire game), Bound by Flame plays out pretty much like a fantasy-lite version of Mass Effect with consequence and effect. Possessed by a flame demon it is up to you, the player, to harness the power of the demon and control it for the good of what is left of mankind or let the demon harness you in its own pursuit for world domination.\n\nFrom a story telling point there isn't much new here on display that we haven't seen already in countless fantasy games, books or movies so in effect you won't really be playing Bound by Flame for its strong narrative. Characters aren't particularly well fleshed out and simply exist to fill in the genres staple trope of healer, witch, ranger and knight (of which you get the chance to toggle between as companions during your adventure through the lands of Vertiel). While the game may be lacking in characterization it certainly makes up for it with its zany and often offbeat sense of humor. Most of the people you engage with in the world will often say the most inane and ludicrous things which had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion. This was something I was not really expecting, particularly from an RPG where you are once again cast in the shoes as eternal savior.\n\nThe game also falters somewhat by recycling many of the enemies you encounter repeatedly only ever introducing one or two new enemies into the mix the further you explore. I can't really fault the game on this though given the limited budget the developers were probably working within. Some parts of the game also look incredibly rushed and I have a feeling this was probably due to getting the game out onto the new consoles as quickly as possible since both the PS4 and XBONE are still severely lacking in quality first party titles so a sale here should reap far more rewards than releasing when each new consoles product backlog is booming. With that being said though, Bound by Flame does look rather good in some of its incredibly limited environments.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340055068\nWhere Bound by Flame does shine is with its incredibly fast, fluid and responsive combat. Combat in Bound by Flame moves at a frantic clip and is a joy to play as you switch in and out of play styles (dual-wielding, warrior and pyromancer). It does take some time getting used to though which has the effect of making the earlier part of the game a difficult slog as you settle into a style that suits you best but once you master its intricacies and you learn when to parry and when to strike an enemy the game becomes incredibly fun to play. As you level up you are also given the choice to plow points into one of three skill trees that makes the game a little more easier depending on the route you choose.\n\nI chose to invest most of my points into the ranger (expert) and pyromancer skill tree which made the game seem remarkably easier than it intitally was upon booting it up for the first time. Bound by Flame, whilst no where near Dark Souls level of difficulty, can at times be incredibly challenging and you will need to be constantly aware of the enemies surrounding you else you will get cornered and hammered to death within seconds. Some of Bound by Flames enemies are brutal and hit particularly hard and I found the ranger's doge ability to be a lifesaver during these intense sequences. You can also craft your own supplies and augment your weaponry and armour with items that give you stat boosts plus add certain magical types of resistance.\n\nDuring combat you will often be accompanied by one of the companions mentioned above and you are given the ability to enter into a tactical menu (which slows the entire game down)  while you issue orders to your sidekick during battle. This is not Dragon Age: Origins however,  so don't go in expecting as intricate a system as that classic. I found that generally getting each companion to block most incoming attacks directed at them worked wonders in keeping them alive during battle so that they provided more aid than hinderance. Thankfully Bound by Flame allows you to save your progress at any given point so you will never feel like you are replaying swathes of the game just to advance.  If I have a gripe here it's that companions can't really die and even if they fall in battle once the fight is over they wil be back up and running as if nothing had happend before. This was a slight disappointment as I was hoping that their losses in battle would result in their deaths which in turn would have some sort of impact on the game world and its storyline but alas this was not the case.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339439208\nBound by Flame is now my sleeper hit of 2014. I can whole-heartily say that I loved most of every minute of it (even with all of its flaws) and had I paid heed to all the negative criticism the game got I would have probably denied myself the pleasures of its rustic charm. While certainly no classic its definitely a game I can recommend to anyone who loves a challenging aRPG diversion and is the perfect title to tide you over until the next big RPG hitters arrives in the form of Dragon Age: Inquistion and The Witcher 3.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 20, 2014","true","38.8"," 292 of 370 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","292","370","12","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/243930/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","I generally hate it when people reduce a work in any medium down to what it bears the most obvious similarities to. It strikes me as doing a disservice to the work, and more to the point, as being critically lazy. The problem when discussing something like Bound by Flame, then, is that you really can’t get around doing so, because it is very deliberately meant to be a low-priced spin on Dragon Age.\n\nIt’s got enough of its own merits that it comes off as a homage or a work by fans rather than a deliberate case of follow-the-leader, with a surprisingly funny script, although it completely loses focus as you move into the third chapter, and a combat engine that has some genuinely interesting ideas built into it. The problem is that it’s not quite done yet, although there’s enough here that a theoretical sequel could be something special.\n\nThe player in Bound by Flame is Vulcan, a build-your-own hero in the Bioware tradition who has given up his or her previous life to serve as a demolitions specialist in a mercenary company called the Freeborn Blades. The Blades, as the game starts, are one of the only surviving organized groups in the world of Vertiel, which is currently under siege by an army of undead led by the Lords of Ice. Most nations have fallen, with the elves left as the last civilization standing, and all the Lords have to do is cleanup.\n\nThe Blades are hired to provide security for another organization, the Red Scribes, as they conduct a ritual that’s meant to provide some last chance at survival, if not victory. Vulcan’s in the wrong place at the wrong time as the ritual concludes and ends up as the unwitting host of a previously-unknown entity: a demon with powers over flame.\n\nThe central ethical issue in Bound by Flame is how much free rein you’re going to give the demon. The more power you get from it, the more it changes Vulcan’s body; soon your skin darkens to black, you sprout horns, and you end up with parts of your body constantly on fire. If you side with the surviving humans and try to save as many of them as you can along the way, you deny the demon. If you listen to its advice and ignore all other concerns in the name of gaining enough power to challenge the Lords directly, you give the demon what it wants.\n\nThe demon’s abilities represent one of three skill trees that are available to you. The Warrior tree uses a single two-handed sword and focuses on damage resistance, sheer power, and delivering massive damage with a few slow swings. The Ranger tree combines stealth and rapid attacks into a sort of swashbuckler option, sacrificing damage resistance in favor of dodges and counterattacks. Finally, the Pyromancer tree provides you with ways to set the undead on fire.\n\nYou can switch between the three skill trees at will and improve each one point by point every time you level up. Each has an ultimate ability that’s unlocked when you invest at least 24 points into it, and heavy investment in a single tree makes the game a very different experience. In practice, you’re going to be a Warrior or Ranger with occasional points spent in Pyromancer, and both approaches are intuitive and reasonably fun with a little practice. The enemies telegraph their attacks far enough in advance that you can figure out ways to deal with them, and you have a number of alternate options like explosive traps and a crossbow that you can use to help even the odds.\n\nIf anything, the skill trees are too top-heavy. If you try to spread your points around, the early areas will prove difficult. You really want to improve Burning Weapon as fast as you can, because even standard enemies tend to have tons of health, and whatever you can do to whittle them down is worth doing.\n\nIn fact, one of the major criticisms I have of Bound by Flame is its difficulty. The combat system feels pretty good once you get used to it, but any enemy with the ability to knock you down can easily kill you, and there won’t be much you can do about it. Some kind of rapid recovery or roll would go a long way towards removing the frustration.\n\nYou can have a companion NPC with you for most of the game, but they’re usually not a factor aside from absorbing a few stray hits; enemies usually mob your companion straight away and kill him or her, then turn to you once they’re done. You have to work around that tendency for companions to be worth a damn. They all seem to have a death wish, and it’s rare that they survive even a simple fight. In short, Bound by Flame feels like it’s harder than it needs to be. Standard enemies are tough enough to kill you in a few lucky hits, bosses can send you flying or corner you with little difficulty, and it’s rare that a death feels fair.\n\nThe graphics don’t necessarily impress strictly from a technical standpoint. You won’t be wowed by intricate detail or uber-authentic realism. You might even find the dark, forbidding world oppressive. Even so, there are many who will appreciate such an atmosphere, as the ambiance fits the action perfectly, and the style is what you’d expect from a fantastical, medieval-type adventure.\n\nThe sound fluctuates between some generic hack ‘n slash combat effects and an inspired soundtrack that really takes shape during dangerous encounters. On the plus side, I don’t usually notice the musical score in such games, but I definitely noticed this one. It ratcheted up the intensity a few notches, and it’s not overly repetitive. The voice acting is largely forgettable, but overall, the audio and graphics work together to present the player with a world that demands our attention.\n\nAll in all, Bound by Flame is a really fun game taken down only by its not-so-great story and voice acting. If that’s something you can get past to play a good action RPG, then this is surely a game you should have no qualms about picking up. If you’re more inclined to wince and shudder at poor dialogue and acting, then I suggest you give this one a pass.","February 2","true","49.9"," 86 of 96 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","86","96","4","0"

Me and a friend of mine saw it pop up on steam a while ago and pre ordered it.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nThe review will have some plot points as its one of the many issues with this game.\n\nWe were so disapointed, il let him make a review if he wants so I will tell it all from my perspective. The trailers have lied, the combat isnt adaptable or planned etc. Its broken. As a Warrior I found it boring and repetative, then with some enemies having the ability to not be stunned or blocked you come across enemies that chain stun you in a corner and kill you. Over and over. But I got over that, I carried on playing and found plenty of other flaws.\n\nThe ability of choise is an illusion, there are basically 2 options, become a demon and kill everyone you care about or stay good and I can assume not kill everyone. I became a demon and after that the game was basically set in stone. I had the odd decision to make, weather its to kill 1 boss and let others be killed or help in a battle. But it dosent seem to matter, the game is on rails and basically makes the decision for you and you companion is now screwed over, runs off and vows revenge. Which he tries to get but fails miserably, you dont even have the option to try and talk people down like in Mass Effect or get told the "Good" or "Bad" options, you get streamlined down a boring story that makes no sense. The characters are not likeable at all, you dont really care about who lives or dies, I just found myself frustrated that I couldnt prevent mit if I decided.\n\nThey also said that the classes are different and theres different ways to play the game, the only tallent tree I didnt fill was the Rogue tree and that was because it was pointless. II filled the warrior tree and used all of its 4 abities that were generic and boring, I had the Pyromancy tree half done so I gave my weapon flames and that was about it really.\n\nFrom what I could see and heard from my friend Pyromancy is just throwing fireballs running out of Mana then giving your weapon fire and going into melee to be diisapointed as you suck in melee but have no other choise. I dont really have much more to say on this since I didnt play it to its full extent.\n\nOne positive of this game is that its incredibly pretty, they have done a fantastic job with the graphics and the design of the weapons and armor is great, you really do feel like a badass when you upgrade your gear through a very simple yet effective crafting system. Thats a couple of positives but you get the idea.\n\nIn summary, dont buy the game now. Its a badly thought out poor quality rpg that forces you to make decisions that in the end dont matter, get it when its on sale. I finished the game in 13  hours and for £25 I was upset about this. Id say its worth £10 max. My friend playing Pyro finished it in 7. I dont knkow if its me sucking taking that long or Pyros just easier.\n\nHope this was Helpful.","May 10, 2014","false","14.3"," 415 of 599 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","415","599","3","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/243930/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I generally hate it when people reduce a work in any medium down to what it bears the most obvious similarities to. It strikes me as doing a disservice to the work, and more to the point, as being critically lazy. The problem when discussing something like Bound by Flame, then, is that you really can’t get around doing so, because it is very deliberately meant to be a low-priced spin on Dragon Age. It’s got enough of its own merits that it comes off as a homage or a work by fans rather than a deliberate case of follow-the-leader, with a surprisingly funny script, although it completely loses focus as you move into the third chapter, and a combat engine that has some genuinely interesting ideas built into it. The problem is that it’s not quite done yet, although there’s enough here that a theoretical sequel could be something special.\n\nThe player in Bound by Flame is Vulcan, a build-your-own hero in the Bioware tradition who has given up his or her previous life to serve as a demolitions specialist in a mercenary company called the Freeborn Blades. The Blades, as the game starts, are one of the only surviving organized groups in the world of Vertiel, which is currently under siege by an army of undead led by the Lords of Ice. Most nations have fallen, with the elves left as the last civilization standing, and all the Lords have to do is bat cleanup.\n\nThe Blades are hired to provide security for another organization, the Red Scribes, as they conduct a ritual that’s meant to provide some last chance at survival, if not victory. Vulcan’s in the wrong place at the wrong time as the ritual concludes and ends up as the unwitting host of a previously-unknown entity: a demon with powers over flame.\n\nThe central ethical issue in Bound by Flame is how much free rein you’re going to give the demon. The more power you get from it, the more it changes Vulcan’s body; soon your skin darkens to black, you sprout horns, and you end up with parts of your body constantly on fire. If you side with the surviving humans and try to save as many of them as you can along the way, you deny the demon. If you listen to its advice and ignore all other concerns in the name of gaining enough power to challenge the Lords directly, you give the demon what it wants.\n\nThe demon’s abilities represent one of three skill trees that are available to you. The Warrior tree uses a single two-handed sword and focuses on damage resistance, sheer power, and delivering massive damage with a few slow swings. The Ranger tree combines stealth and rapid attacks into a sort of swashbuckler option, sacrificing damage resistance in favor of dodges and counterattacks. Finally, the Pyromancer tree provides you with a hundred and one ways to set undead on fire.\n\nYou can switch between the three skill trees at will and improve each one point by point every time you level up. Each has an ultimate ability that’s unlocked when you invest at least 24 points into it, and heavy investment in a single tree makes the game a very different experience. In practice, you’re going to be a Warrior or Ranger with occasional points spent in Pyromancer, and both approaches are intuitive and reasonably fun with a little practice. The enemies telegraph their attacks far enough in advance that you can figure out ways to deal with them, and you have a number of alternate options like explosive traps and a crossbow that you can use to help even the odds.\n\nIf anything, the skill trees are too top-heavy. If you try to spread your points around, the early areas will prove difficult. You really want to improve Burning Weapon as fast as you can, because even standard enemies tend to have tons of health, and whatever you can do to whittle them down is worth doing.\n\nIn fact, one of the major criticisms I have of Bound by Flame is its difficulty. The combat system feels pretty good once you get used to it, but any enemy with the ability to knock you down can easily kill you, and there won’t be much you can do about it. Some kind of rapid recovery or roll would go a long way towards removing the frustration.\n\nYou can have a companion NPC with you for most of the game, but they’re usually not a factor aside from absorbing a few stray hits; enemies usually mob your companion straight away and kill him or her, then turn to you once they’re done. You have to work around that tendency for companions to be worth a damn. They all seem to have a death wish, and it’s rare that they survive even a simple fight.\n\nIn short, Bound by Flame feels like it’s harder than it needs to be. Standard enemies are tough enough to kill you in a few lucky hits, bosses can send you flying or corner you with little difficulty, and it’s rare that a death feels fair. Combined with the script losing cohesion at around the halfway point, Bound by Flame has an unfinished, generally unpolished feel that sometimes makes it a frustrating game to play.\n\nIt’s entertaining enough despite its faults that it’s worth checking out. If Spiders gets the chance to put together a sequel, with a more cohesive story and another pass or two on the combat system, this could be the start of a fun series.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 20, 2014","true","19.2"," 167 of 228 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","167","228","2","4"

Couldn't have cared less if they died.\n- Clunky and somewhat awkward combat system\n- Short plot with very little narrative (basically wanting you to focus on the "possessed by a demon" idea to distract from the skeleton bare plot and narrative)\n- Obscure and very selective character relation mechanics\n- Unorginal, cliche ideas (literally feels like the storyline and numerous character models were pulled from Dragon Age and other fantasy RPGs)\n- Generally inconsistant with itself\n\nI apologize - I really have very little to say that's positive about this game. I discovered the game prior to its release and was insanely excited from what I saw. Fast forward 6 months-1 year and discovered it again in a Steam Sale and bought it at almost full price (which I rarely do). 13.5 hours is all it takes to get to the end boss, even with doing every side quest I could get my hands on. It is a very linear plot and I found myself rather disappointed at every turn with what the developers could have done with such an interesting and unique game idea. I had to force myself to sit down and try and get through the game to the end so I feel I had gotten some of my money's worth back, and, well, barring that... I can at least give a review for the game. I wouldn't recommend this game to hard-core/serious RPG players, seeing as it lacks in these very qualities that I had hoped/expected from it. If you're looking for a good soundtrack, the music isn't bad and the art is creatively inspired, if somewhat repetitive.\nI can't say much more than I don't recommend this game. I got to the final boss, exited out of the game, and immediately uninstalled it, having no desire to play this game again. If you're looking for a pass time and this game is on-sale for +75%, feel free - otherwise you're being cheated out of your money.","November 21, 2015","false","13.3"," 163 of 239 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","163","239","10","0"

The actual game play represents a classic Action Game, consisting all of the usuals, heavy attacks, blocks, swipe attacks, as well as your magic abilities. The combt system can feel a little clunky to begin with, but once you work out the timings on when to block and parry attacks, it's OK.\n\nI would say the mainstory is a little short for the price tag. I finished the game in just under fourteen hours. I would highly recommend you finish the majority of the side missions as to get a few levels advantage over the story, as some of the end bosses are quite challenging.\n\nThat being said, the bosses in Bound by Flame have a very Dark Souls'esk feel to them. You have to work out the best stratergy to take them down, often resulting in a number of failed attempts before it finally clicks.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty good game, but I would wait until sale season starts before you pick it up since it is certainly not worth the full price tag.","November 17, 2014","true","13.9"," 108 of 152 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","108","152","5","1"

Only got 67% approval rating?\n\nThis game is the very first ARPG Spider studio ever made. Honestly it's not bad at all. It's like a Witcher 2 on discount and I like combat in here better then Darksoul even.(it's not a button masher! you have to time everything). (Edit 2: Ya.. and my review is getting chewed alive because of that dark souls comment.. Anyhow since I only play the tutorial stage of it.. i should really don't say this comment. O.. well i will leave it here just for laugh)\n\nSpider Stuido ventured out and tried many many different things for this game. Most of the ingrediant worked but just like a pot of stew. With a few minor flawed ingrediant and a drop of Rat goo would ruined the entire Stew!(game).\n\nMinor flaws 1:\nNot all idea are implemented.\nThere is day and night system that you can rest to change time for events to happen. Much like FF: Lighting return or Baldur's gate series. But through the entire story.. you don't need to rest once. And there is only 1 event and 1 subquest that require you to go out at night.\nCraftable items are very interesting but you can only craft to upgrade weapons but you cannot create weapons and armors from parts.. and There are very few different type of items that you can use to craft.. It's like less then 10 types of ingrediant in the entire game. And every single type of monster in the entire game drop 1 of those 10 types of items.\nThere are 3 different class and for Warrior class you can use 3 different type of weapon.. Sword, Axe and Hammer. But there are not too much difference between them. Even animation looks almost the same.\n\nMinor Flaw 2:\nCharacter development.\nThe scripting of most of the story and general background is really good. But sometimes I cannot tell if it's being rushed or the story teller is drunk some time.\nYou can feel this is a really big world with an impending unstopable army that dread upon it at the very beginning of the game. There are interesting clan of people and some really fun and unexpected event twist..\nThat's all good but with the 4 major partner that you have that help you on your journey are really messed up.\n2 male and 2 female that you can start a small romance with much like mass effect series. And 2 other part time partner including Mr.Mathras that travels you with certain quests. There are just not enough character development for a few character to make plot change reasonable and sometime it makes you scratch your head because there are too many question marks on it. Why do my girl suddenly romance the knight and elf? No hints about that's coming ever!\n\nMinor Flaw 3:\nPartner AI.. Well. The enemy AI was well done.. They know when to block.. when to counter.. when to run and they even ran to call help sometimes. They fight smart and why cannot my Partner fight smart? Most of the time.. My partner just tanks 1-2 enemy and dies within a minute and buy me just enough time to kill some archers.. The combat modes and order doesn't really help. Setting on defense mode just make them live at least a bit longer so it's recommended.\n\nAnd finnaly the Rat Goo that ruined this great meal.\nIt's short coming are just too short! Literally!\n\nThis game is too short.. I am running 2 games at same time to get all achievements. 1 female human route on captain difficulty and 1 male demon route on vulcan difficulty. Together I finished both game back to back in just a little over 30 hours! That's including all the goofing off at easy difficulty to find all dialoge options and side quest and all the death on hard difficulty...\n\nIt almost seems I finnaly got into the fun and core of the game and it suddenly ended! I am sure if another player skips all the guide and just rush though the yellow story event marker all the time and ignore all the side quest.. This game can be done in less then 6 hours! Level really doesn't mean much other then it gives some skill and talents points. You stuck on 100 hp and mp unless you finish specific quests.\n\nOver all did I enjoy this game? Yes I did for a few days.. Am I satisfied? No I am not.. IT could been a triple A title if they just made the story 3 times the current length and fix a few flaws...\n\nThat's all i am gonna say.. 7.0/10 Recommended for quick Action game Lover.. RPG lovers may love and hate this game at the same time..\n\nEdit 1: My review is too long... I just had too much to say and I had to trim it down 3 times so it can fit...","September 17, 2015","true","28.9"," 197 of 296 people (67%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","67","197","296","23","25"

The combat feels clunky and I often find myself unable to execute an action because my character has not finished the animation from the previous attack. This makes it feel as though my character is drunk and unable to react quickly, The devs advertise "strategic combat" but it just ends up being button mashing. The counter/parry system is basic, nothing new.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, with environments and NPCs being highly detailed. Animations however, particularly facial ones are quite stiff and jittery. The lip syncing is very poor, often with characters' mouth animations stopping mid sentence or finishing before the audio. At one point, while I was in a conversation with a character an NPC was spawned about 2 metres away from where I was. It was very noticable as he just appeared in mid-air and fell to the ground where he proceeded to stand and perform his normal animations. Fortunately this has only happened once, but it greatly detracted from the immersion.\n\nThe voice acting is average, however I was not pleased to hear modern American colloquialisms such as "I got" instead of "I've got" in some of the characters' sentences.\n\nThe story itself is fairly interesting, however it is nothing we haven't seen before and it is not enough to make up for the other problems this game has.\n\nI am maybe being too harsh on this game as "Spiders" are a small studio, but I have to give an honest recount of my experience with this game.

The Blades along with the Elves & the Red Scribes fiercely stand as the last bastion of civilization against the might of the seven Ice Lords & their Deadwalker minions who seek to plunge Vertiel into an everlasting Ice Age. You – Vulcan – stand on the precipice of Vertiel. Will you be able to stem the frozen tide?\n\nBefore embarking upon your journey, you will be met with the character creation screen. The options present are few but include the ability to change hair/face type in addition to customizing your character’s name. The option to choose gender is also present.\n\nVertiel is a harsh & unforgiving land with varying environments, from tree-filled swamps to death-ridden sewers. The environments are linear, disjointed & feel claustrophobic at times despite much of the game taking place in outdoor locales.\n\nThere are three unique skill trees – Warrior, Ranger & Pyromancer, which allow you to customize your playthrough. There are several different weapon types as well. Ultimately, you’ll have to allot skill points according to which weapon you desire to use throughout. While there is some wiggle room in the ability to customize your character, it is somewhat limited as to variability. Also present is a feat system that grants a wide array of bonuses to crafting, health/mana, exploration etc., depending on how feat points are spent.\n\nThe combat feels fluid & rewarding upon dispatching your enemies into the afterlife. The boss fights are of particular note, as they are quite difficult & well-thought out in their construction. The final boss encounter was a personally euphoric experience. Even the most battle hardened will experience difficulty here.\n\nAs you adventure throughout Vertiel you will encounter foes & allies alike. Foes will become friends & friends will become foes, instigated by war’s untimely wrath. Certain allies will be able to join you on your adventure & assist you in battle, providing everything from damage absorption to the critical heal that will permit the eventuality of victory. Unfortunately, their use is highly variable & they become almost useless in certain drawn-out encounters.\n\nBound by Flame has an in-depth crafting system, enabling the crafting of potions, traps & even weapon/armor upgrades to slay the most formidable of foes. Much time can be wasted perfecting each piece of equipment to desired playstyle.\n\nThe dialogue in Bound by Flame is its Achilles’ heel. It does not suit the fantasy environment in any capacity whatsoever. The facial animations are equally as poor. Coupled together they provide a major drawback for any player seeking an immersive fantasy experience.\n\nThe art style & graphics provide a suitable backdrop. Other than being simply existing as a medium for the story to unravel, they don’t provide much in the way of eye candy. There is also a literal plethora of cut scenes rendered with the in-game engine. The majority of them can be skipped however, if heart longs for battle.\n\nOlivier Deriviére, creator of the soundtrack, also creator of the soundtrack to Remember Me, pulls no punches in creating a phenomenal score that exudes both wonder & excitement. Getting lost in the different bits & pieces of it are a certainty & a joy.\n\nIn conclusion, Bound by Flame is a mixed bag in the RPG genre. It flourishes in its strengths but continually stumbles upon its mistakes. Despite its drawbacks, Bound by Flame is note-worthy & very much worth a try for fans of the genre.\n\n7/10","May 1, 2015","true","40.5"," 69 of 97 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","69","97","0","10"

The game has few redeeming qualitie. The combat system is rather boring and repetitive with there only being about 10, including bosses, enemy types all of which function rather similarly to each other with big "get out of the way" tells. When it manages to execute itself well, it feels moderately rewarding and is nice to look at, however there are a fair number of wonky hit boxes, awkward animations, and the staggerable archers that can shoot arrows behind them. The plot is rather uninteresting and full of that sort of cliche edginess to it with awkward vulgarity and do this or I will beat your skull in lines of dialogue. The characters are at times enjoyable, but for the most part lack any sort of depth or development, and your companions contributions to the battlefield little more than a distracting meatshield for a few seconds before them dying a brutal death and laying on the ground for the next 5 minutes of boss combat.\nAll in all I would rate this game at 2-2.5/5.

Makes you actually feel like you don't care about them and -kinda- change your deposition of them.

Traps, arrows, etc are more limited ammo till later on when you can afford them.\n*I know this shouldn't really matter, but it kinda does in my book considering you made the combat system, you should allow mistakes on both ends; monsters attacks going through their partners. Could just make them wait to attack like other games.[/noap]\n*How long conversations are that -can be- pointless. Like talking to a shop dealer.\n\nDepends:\n*I know swearing is a meh to some people in games, but it ruins the immersion for me, all the characters are free vocab and ehhhhhh, just doesn't sound right I guess.\n*Similar to Dark Souls, but probably a little easier. Still though, less life, less def, more loading save files.\n*Default face looks like a Spartan.\n*Gives you the option to name yourself, but uses default name throughout game.\n*Lots of random items found around a given map.\n*Some form of grinding for exp, maybe farming for items to use in crafts.\n\n\n","May 8, 2014","false","18.3"," 277 of 458 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","277","458","0","4"

No going through bags and stuff, you just get it all.\n- the UI, inventory, quest management and so on is pretty well organised and easy to follow\n- the idea for the core of the story is not bad\n- swear words! I like swear words in computer games!\n- the voice acting is pretty good even if the actual text is really weak\n\nand that's it, I honestly can not think of anything else that's good about the game. (in my experience and from my point of view).\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- it boasted player choice, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I can not count the amount of times I was given a choice, only for the opposite of what I'd chosen to be forced on me. Even when rescuing a guy who got lost in the sewars, I was forced to bring him back to camp before moving on in the sewars just a little further to complete a second quest that was close by\n- the conversations with NPCs are bad, terrible\n- it's a rip off of Dragon Age in many ways even going as far as having the "suspicious witch" (Morrigan)\n- there was a tooltip saying that it was important to shop when in town. I was looking forward to going to town, you never do.\n- speaking of which, nothing I found in shops was ever useful to me\n- the enemies are totally unbalanced (I don't mean too hard, I mean sometimes too easy and sometimes too hard). Not to mention the last boss who is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous even if you switch down to easy mode. I had a harder time fighting 3 recruits than the Lord of Ice\n- the "classes" are forced on you, I wanted to play 100% warrior but leveled much higher and maxed that tree early on.\n- the story is really short, there are only 4 acts and there really aren't many hours of gameplay\n- the friends you take with you are entirely useless !! I mean totally useless, they do no damage at all to the NPC enemies, the only use in having them tag along is in tanking some of the lowbie mobs (for a short while before they die)\n- though the combat is the strong part of the game (imo) some aspects of it drove me mad. For example, it does happen that in the case of point and click fights I spam the mouse button. That usually isn't a problem but in this game, the commands are chained for a bit, so if the mob does something which requires you to use another skill, you have to wait for the chain of attacks which you spammed to finish. That was very annoying.\n- You'll probably finish the game in less than 20 hours even if you do all the side quests.. that's very short imo.\n\n\nSome people asked on forums whether this game was like Dark Soul, I haven't played Dark Soul yet, however I can tell you that on normal difficulty (Hawk), I died regularly in common fights. That's a good thing though, cause there is a bit of player skill involved in the combat.\n\nOne last thing, I didn't put the graphics in either good or bad because even though they are not very good, they aren't very bad either. The environment is mostly cartoony than real but I guess that also means you get a high FPS and smooth gameplay.\n\nAll in all, even though I bought this game with a 75% discount, I regreted it and would only recommend it for someone looking for a cheap RPG but who has really nothing else to play.\n\nPS The last boss is ridiculous, did I mention that?\n","December 22, 2014","false","19.3"," 203 of 335 people (61%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","61","203","335","27","9"

What use is your Pyromancy if it's crap and wont help you survive or help beat the bosses. It's good enough for trashmobs but fails at providing any benefit during boss battles.\n\nHigher difficulties aren't hard due to gameplay but due to enemies just STUNLOCKING you without you being able to do anything against it (If you're not in Ranger Mode, that is) You NEED to be in Ranger stance to even be able to survive Bosses due to the "Dodge" skill. Bosses will either Stunlock you to death or instantly break through your Parrystance and then Stunlock you to death. The Warrior and Pyromancer have NO MOBILITY skills at all so you have no way to react on AoE effects as simply running out of the "zone" is too slow and blocking it doesn't work. Neither of the skills in Warrior or Pyromancer tree are remotely usefull against bosses so if you're playing on higher difficulties any point you don't put into Daggers and Ranger are wasted.\n\nPS: There is no way to respec your points, at least there wasn't one by the end of ACT 2. So if you're the kind who loves to go into a game "blind" and who likes to "experiment" with skill trees, you're going to have a bad bad time.","May 10, 2014","false","28.5"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","42","60","0","0"

All the original points are still there its simply more easy to process.\n\nCombat: Combat is not fun for several reasons:\n1. Hit boxes for enemies are larger than they appear on screen. An enemy will swing at you, and you won't see them make contact with you but you will still take damage.\n2. You are very slow. When facing 4-5 enemies, your character isn't fast enough to get off an attack either with you longsword or your daggers. Your mana takes so long to respawn magic isn't much help either. All you can do is block...the parry ability (brought over from Mars: War Logs) is really the only thing you can do.\n3. You can only dodge when using daggers. And then you can only dodge directly backwards. No rolling away and behind your enemy like in Mars: War Logs. There's no real reason why you shouldn't have this ability. Its like when they took the ability to jump out of the new Thief game.\n4. All these things make combat a huge drag. You could run around constantly waiting for your mana to slowly recharge and then slowly wittle away at your enemies with magic but not only is this tedious but their ranged attacks, which stagger you to a ridiculous degree, make this even more of a pain.\n\nDialogue:\n1. Terrible lip-synching. The characters just constantly wiggle the sides of their mouths. Creepy and awful.\n2. Terrible dialogue. Can't decide whether it wants to be fantasy dialogue, gritty Witcher style dialogue, or just plain awful. The characters will have lines that seem entirely out of character and out of place.\n3. Voice acting: Not as bad. Some characters are worse than others, especially the elf Sybil. Your merc captain sounds pretty cool but that seems about it.\n\ngraphics: usually i ignore this if the gameplay/dialogue is great. But they aren't.\n1. Graphics are sub-par and blocky. Supposedly next gen, but obviously not. Far away land-scapes such as mountains look especially bad. THe only thing that saves it is the lighting (which is pretty great).\n\nGood things:\n1. Lighting. Helps keep scenes immersive where the dialogue and graphics might otherwise break it.\n2. Music. It's cool. I plan on buying the OST.\n3. Crafting. All the awsome crafting stuff you had in Mars: War Logs is directly transplanted in this game.\n\nWhat would make this game worth buying:\n1. A patch/mod fixing the combat. Adding a combat roll/dodge for both character types would eliminate the other frustrating elements of combat. Also, fixing the combat would eliminate the other problems I had with the game.\n2. A really good sale. At least 75% off.\n3. You want to support the developers...even though I don't like this game and would never recoment it without these reservations, I am glad somebody likes it so that Spiders doesn't go out of business.\n\nWhy you should buy this game\nMost of the people who like this game seem to really like Dark Souls. So if you like unforgiving, difficult, frustrating combat (call it a challenge if you want), then you will probably like this.","May 8, 2014","false","4.2"," 197 of 346 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","197","346","0","55"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/recommended/243930/","cosmicengine","Cosmic Engine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/","309 products in account","In Depth Video Review - http://youtu.be/xaklamoOjqE\n\nHello I'm Cosmic and welcome to Bound by Flame a new action RPG developed by French studio Spiders and published by focus home interactive. Spiders themselves have worked on previous RPG's such as the underrated Of Orcs and Men, Bound by Flame however is arguably their biggest solo project to date and it's an ambitious one at that. I have been looking at the game for some time and been very interested to play it since RPG's are my chosen genre in video games, I hold RPG's standards of both gameplay and storytelling to very high standards so let's take a look at the game.\n\nBound by Flame puts you in the role of Vulcan, the power master or demolition man of the legendary mercenary company the Freeborn Blades. The game gives you limited but good character creation while there are only a limited number of faces and hairstyles of the character each one has great detail. Another thing I do love is the ability to create a male or female character. On top of this, if choosing the female version of Vulcan it doesn't feel tacked on like in some other RPG's, in fact the female version of Vulcan was my personal favourite as she was very well voice acted, has specific romance options and ultimately was a complete and utter bad ♥♥♥.\n\nBound by flame isn't an open world RPG like Skyrim, in fact its very similar in design to The Witcher 2. The game world is set into hubs, each hub will have a base camp or town and then has several surrounding areas, these aren't small areas, there’s plenty to see and explore and the each area is a lot bigger than what Deus Ex Human revolution had that used similar hub like level design. The world design is very nice, there’s a good variety of environments from humid swamps to the frozen north. The games graphics are great to look at, its a very pretty game and while it has its graphical flaws with some armor clipping and such, overall its a great visual experience and has nothing that breaks the immersion of the game.\n\nLets talk about the combat of the game since you'll be fighting the deadwalker army a hell of a lot. Similar also to the Witcher 2 you have to buttons to attack, one for a quick attack, good for dealing with single enemies and the other is a area attack, useful for groups. Your version of Vulcan has several ways of dealing with enemies as well as a choice of weapons and fighting styles. First is the Warrior stance which uses Vulcan's two handed sword. The warrior stance is all about powerful damaging blows, ripostes, breaking the enemies guard and good sweeping area attacks. It's the slowest of the combat styles and depending on the weapon, the attack speed and damage will vary.\n\nSecond is the Ranger stance which uses Vulcans dual daggers. The ranger stance is all about stealth, speed and dodging. You can only be in stealth in the ranger stance and attacking enemies unaware gives a huge damage bonus. The ranger stance is a good damage dealing, the speed of attacks can slice and dice your enemies however the attacks while there are more of them, they are weaker meaning heavily armoured opponents will require you to switch to warrior. Ranger stance is the only stance that allows you to dodge as the parrying with dual daggers against big ♥♥♥ swords isn't particularly effective. Which actually brings me to something that really annoys me about combat that I can't just roll or dodge in any stance. That being said there’s a fair amount of player skill involved in combat as riposting and parrying requires good timing. Perfectly timing a parry will invoke a riposte and often that riposte will critical hit causing devastating damage especially useful against tougher enemies.The last major part of combat is your spells and abilities, your demon allows you to wield the power of flame. There are various fire spells available to you but not only this you also as a powder master have access to traps and a crossbow. The allows for you to strategize and prepare for upcoming battles.\n\nAll the combat stances can be upgraded through the path system. Once you gain a level you'll unlock points to place into the three paths available to you. The three paths are Warrior, Ranger and pyromancer. The path system gives you the means to customize your character to specialize in which ever fighting style you prefer. Like stealth and daggers, go for ranger, want a magic based character, go for pyromancer. The path has a variety of unlocks that allow your to augement your existing abilities and attacks as well and improving your character base stats. On top of the Path system are character feats, these are feats that you can purchase with feat points to unlock certain upgrades to things like crafting, alchemy, heath etc etc. You can also gain feats from certain choices in the game which will effect your characters stats.\n\nLet's move on to crafting, crafting is a major element of the game. Throughout the world you'll find resources to use to craft. Crafting in bound by flame is more like augementing. Any piece of armour or weapons have crafting slots in which you can craft a good selection of different items that offer different statisitcal upgrades and bonuses. For example if you wish to upgrade your two handed sword you can craft a selections of hilts and pommels each with different looks and attritubes. You can also recycle your old equipment for materials too, more powerful enchancements will require rarer materials so use your materials wisely. I really enjoyed customizing my equipment, armour customizing is particularly fun as it has the most expansive range of looks and bonuses. It's particularly important to add enchancements that suit your style of play, for example if your playing a character who focuses on magic, then armour upgrades that boost mana and mana regen is a good way to go.\n\nNow then lets talk about what is the biggest thing for me in this game the story. At the end of the day this is a story driven RPG and I have to say that without giving any spoilers the main story overall is told very well. The game has several endings depending on your choices in the game especially the choices you make with your own demonic possession. The story is well paced though in some places it does get a little disjointed by skipping little bits of information but it gets back on track well. It took me around 16 hours to complete my first playthorugh of the game, now that is a little short and there were plenty of things I missed especially with the companions. If this was a full $60 game I would say its well to short however, its a $40 title. Not only that but theres plenty of replayability as I discovered during my second playthrough, choosing different choices not only effects the ending but also events along the way too. It actually means that you can play the game twice and get two different set of events in some places. In all it means that in theory you could easily put 30 hours or more into the game which in my opinion, you certainly get your monies worth. The main story is strong in the game and there are some pretty bad ♥♥♥ moments in there too. The games voice acting is fantastic and I have to commend the voice actors as they did a great job on this one.\n\nCheck out the Video review for more!

So I'll just point out what was good and bad.\n\n- soundtrack is probably the best thing in this game,\n- i love visual aspect of the game. I liked locations, character models, even menu and loading screens, quality is medicore though,\n- three skill trees: Fighter (2h sword), ranger (daggers + stealth), pyromancy. Good mix of pyromancy and ranger will turn hardest difficulty into walk in the park. Focusing on fighter tree will turn normal difficulty into nightmare. Swords deal little damage, and fighter skills are not really usefull (I sugest to leave sword for second playthrough),\n- I like how your decisions change story, ending and possibillity of wearing helmet (you can earn nice horns),\n- fighting mechanics and high difficulty is something that i really like, unfortunatelly game is even harder because of lack of polishing (you have too big hitbox, all enemies are bulletsponges, some spells can hit you even if visually you are out of their range),\n- variety of weapons and armor is rather small but upgrading method is great,\n- useless merchants - they have nothing interesting to buy and you won't sell anything (you will turn everything into crafting materials),\n- finall boss battle - a lot of people whine about it - it is really long and hard. And one mistake can force you to start from the beginning... But it's totally worth it. Treat whole game as preparations to it. Gather traps, arrows and health potions - you will use tham all in finall battle.\n- story is nothing special (but still entertaining), characters are nicelly written (especially Mathras), some dialogues are well written, some are terrible. Characters will give you "personal" quests. Completing them all + taking character to boss battles in last chapter will give you romance opportunity.\n\nBBF is definetelly worht playing.\nNot worth the full price though.","May 7","true","61.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antilucid/recommended/243930/","antilucid","antilucid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antilucid/","2014 products in account","Rarely does a game catch me off guard but in a positive way such as this one did. Stepping in to the shoes of a mercenary has not been this fun since Bulletstorm (it was a blast to play I thought). Instead of stringing combos together with a gun, you have swords, axes, daggers, spells, and traps at your disposal. Not every fight has the same answers but you are more welcome to explore the complex combat system which is easy to quickly get a handle on.This was using a keyboard and mouse. The game boasts full controller support but I little luck really getting my PS3 controller working well or my Steam Controller. Given that the game also has a console experience possible, seeing updates to improve controller support outside of a Xbox 360 would be handy as the game has released on Sony platforms so it would not be a stretch.\n\nWith three skills at your disposal, the warrior and ranger tend to offer players two alternate ways to play the game with fire mage complimenting them both equally. There are times when something just needs to burn and that is handy to not have to go just magic only. Bear in mind, potions to restore health and mana are sparse and should be used with care, not spammed. The crafting system offers a solution to this but letting you craft your own provided the resources are not being used elsewhere in a quest or upgrading gear or more.\n\nThe game tends to hold you by the hand in terms of story to the point the named the main character Vulcan despite given you the option to enter your name in as whatever. It makes sense if you are trying to tell a cohesive story about a single character but either don't call him by name in the voice acting or just remove player choice of name. It wont kill us if we cant name a guy for the sake of immersion. Vulcan and the rest of his fellow mercenaries to tend grate with out of place profanities combine with made up words that insinuate curses. It feels like its aiming for shock value but just because they are mercenaries does it mean they can only express themselves with colorful language. Its a stereotype that seems out of place by today's standard of good writing.\n\nThe game offers a bleak outlook against an ever growing army of undead controlled by 7 ice lords. An unfortunate accident thrusts you in to the limelight as a new tool against this overwhelming army, The cost could prove too great but the choice is out of your hands. Speaking of choices, you are only able to pick and choose one team member at a time. Given that stealth is never my forte (unless its accompanied by a Batsuit), I often choice a healer for a comrade to try to keep me up while I am hacking away at things in between fireballs. Outside of dialogue options and possible romance, there is little choices involved. They appear to always be your level and require no gear at all. You can change their stance to offensive or defensive. I think a dialogue wheel with more options would improve this. Give them a chance to attack their own target or always assist me would be good. A way to control at what percent of their life they run away would also be handy. Many times I tried to fall back to regroup but my caster is still just standing there acting like a tank and not a good one at that.\n\nWhat you do get with this game is an enjoying romp akin to Dragon Age and Kingdoms of Amalur but not quite as indepth. It just might scratch your itch until Inquistion. The game certainly has a lot to offer and is worth giving a shot. This game was played on a Steam Machine and ran beautifully is worth mentioning. The color pallette of the game gets quite diverse from area to area and having to re-tred your own footsteps because of quests and side quests will often leaving stopping to admire a new detail you might not have noticed before. Music is one of the game's strongest points which often erases the screeching left behind by some of the voice actors. Scotland does not exist in this worth as far as we know. The accent stands out a bit much in certain characters. If different characters should sound different, make their appearances reflect this. I am not expecting every one of them to be Troy Baker but him in at least one role would be a game changer.\n\nI give this game praise up and suggest you give it a shot of you like your action steeped in talent trees, crafting, and other rpg elements. A good time is certainly waiting to be bad.

I rather liked being called by name rather than 'friend, boss, hero or other generic title'\nI think the story was ok, definitely a few plotholes. The first part is very complete and well done and the last two chapters rushed and with bits missing. There was a lot of death in this game, I didnt like that my character ended up killing another main character who I wouldnt choose to kill under any circumstances.\nI liked the combat, I was glad I could mix it up a lot. I missed fast travel back to camp but I suspect that was never implented as the game would end up being really short. So going to and fro and fighting the same respawning enemies felt a little bit of a cheap way to level. (I got the feeling a large chunk of the story and game was cut out)\nI am glad I got the choice of endings and some other choices throughout the game (didnt like the 'heroic' choice option) but can live with it.\nI think the crafting and armour upgrades was well done. I liked the interface and the maps. I loved Mathras, his character was the star of the show. Randval was also well acted, and Sybil and that nasty sorceror lady. Female hero's voice and acting wasnt so good, not sure about male.\nI would give this game a 7/10 as I enjoyed it enough to play it through twice.","August 27, 2014","true","32.8"," 38 of 64 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","38","64","0","0"

And that is the worst thing you want in a combat system. I like the menus, I like the customisation, I like the talent trees and skills a lot, but those need combat to work well. The HD textures are okay but no where near enough to justify the price, in the UK this is £30 on steam. I wouldn't even recommend it at 50% off. Maybe not even at 75% to be honest.\n\nAs for the storyline - well, it's terrible. It's a poor storyline, with horrible voice acting (and a few okay bits, but mostly horrible), and terrible writing with awful one liners. Thoroughly predictable and gives absolutely no immersion/connection to the character. And all that would be fine in a game that's 80-90% combat anyway, if the combat wasn't the worst part of the game.\n\nDon't touch this at all, at least, not in it's current state.","May 12, 2014","false","1.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","1"

It is not Mass Effect in a medieval era, that game would be Dragon Age, where they did it right. This game offers the illusion where every choice counts. In order for the different choices to matter to the player, the game needs to stay consistent to the choice. In this game, you may make a choice, and the consequences of that choices are not explained at all, or the game may even go back on that choice completely.\n\nThis game is just not good. The combat is the main reason, it is horrible. You are given 3 skill trees, and right off the bat you have every skill already unlocked in the game, except for the ultimates at the end of the tree. Those that have played RPGs know how not fun it is to already start off with every skill and only spend points to make them stronger. The combat relies heavily on timing of dodging and parrying but can be easily exploited or worked around. For the early player, most enemies will seem to take forever to die, and so you are just spamming the same button combo and animation over and over again until they die. By the end of the game I honestly got sick of fighting enemies so I just ran right past unnecessary ones.\n\nStorywise, the story makes honestly no sense. Im not going to spoil anything for those who mistakenly still want to play, but lets just say it ends on a very lackluster note.\n\nFinal note: Do not buy this game for $40, ever. If the game looks interesting to you, maybe pick it up during a sale, but I would never spend more than $20 on it.","May 12, 2014","false","9.9"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

Just like Mars War Logs, the combat seems difficult and unfair at first but it quickly becomes addictive once you get into it.....IF you get into it before getting frustrated because you tried to play it like it was Witcher or Amalur.\nThe combat reminds me a little bit of some of my fave arcade games like Knights of the Round, D&D Towers of Doom/Shadows over Mystaria.\n\nThe skill tree looks very similar to other games but again this is deceiving. You have a warrior branch (2 handed swords, axes and hammers), a so-called ranger branch that specialises in daggers (no bows), and a magic branch that unlike usual games, is not self-sufficient, its intended more like a buffer than a caster.\n\nThere is also a feat tree (every level you get two skillpoints and one feat point) where you can further improve your character in different ways.\n\nThe so-called crafting is very basic but very practical, can be done everywhere (even in fights) as long as you have the needed materials that you can gather or loot from containers or defeated enemies. The amount and type of upgrades that you can insert on equipment depends on the "level" of the equipment, early armors and weps have very little options while later ones offer a great variety of interesting options.\n\nThere are two secondary weapons that can prove very useful, the crossbow (very limited ammo used mostly for interrupting or poisoning) and the traps. These two weapons could become the only way out of difficult boss fights if you screwed up your character build (like investing points in both the ranger and the warrior branch which is a big mistake).\n\nThe graphics are very good but there is too little variation.\n\nThe story is good but its unpolished, many inconsistencies and loose ends.\nThe decision-making that is supposed to change the story is very underwhelming as is the so-called seduction thing. This aspect was so much better in Mars War Logs.\nAlso its a bit annoying how dialogue options are still there after they are no longer valid, not a big thing but still.\n\nAll in all this is a very entertaining game if you are after an action-RPG with very fluid arcade-style action and a fairly good story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","86.0"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","23","37","0","0"

That would be this game, right here.\n\nMuch like Mars War Logs, the original-idea-to-borrowed-idea ratio is somewhat messy, but the ingenuity of the way some ideas are used, as well as an ask-no-quarter grimdark approach to the story compensate for it.\n\nIf you're looking for an unhyped fantasy RPG to play that's going to fill a "I wish BioWare would spend more time closing plot holes than SJW-chasing"-shaped hole in your heart, this would be this game, right here.\n\nDownsides disclaimer: The third act of the game has a rushed feel to it, as it doesn't quite end the story in the way you'd have expected it to if it were a AAA game, and not in a good sense, but the sheer path-less-takenuity of it was ample compensation for me.\n\nAlso, it's more Witcher 1 than Witcher 3, if you get my drift.

If you enjoyed the other games from Spiders and/or Cyanide then I'm fairly certain you'll enjoy this one too. I did, until it became horribly unbalanced. And this started early on. There are so many difficulty spikes, even on the easiest setting so near the end I had just to quit. There was no way for me to win the last boss fight without having to restart a savegame from a few hours before and in my opinion this game just doesn't deserve my time. I like a challenge, just like everyone else, as long as it's fair. But this game doesn't play fair. And that's when I draw the line.\n\nThe graphics are a good combination of realistic graphics mixed with a bit of cel shading. It actually looks really good, which was one of the features that drew my attention. And the fact that I enjoyed most of their recent games. Of Orcs And Men was just amazing, for example, and it still is to this day very unappreciated by many people.\n\nThe voice acting is a mixed bag with decent voice acting here and there, but the voice of the main character just doesn't sound right. His voice is way too high for a man that looks this rough. It's weird. And some of the writing definitely could've been better.\n\nThe game itself should take you 10-12 hours to finish, if you do nothing but the main quest. I think it took me about 10 hours to get where I am, and I did everything but a few failed quests (total of 8 I think). So completing the entire game will take you 15 hours, maybe a little more if you want to search every corner of the maps. Which is a decent length for an action RPG.\n\nIt's just a shame that they didn't fine tune the difficulty properly. It's the main reason why I will not recommend this game.\n\nMaybe if it gets fixed someday but I doubt it will. Play at your own risk.\n\n[Rating: 68/100]","May 11, 2014","false","13.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NessTamez/recommended/243930/","NessTamez","Baby Guts the Snake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NessTamez/","101 products in account","Right so I got a couple of issues with this game so I'll just separated into categories:\n\nI. Gameplay/Mechanics\n-Good things:\n1. While the combat is difficult most of the time it feels more challenging than a chore\n2. The levelling system for each skill is a nice touch and it can really make a difference\n3. It's a fluid hack and slash comparable to high budget titles in quality such as Batman:GOTY\n4. I love that you can craft, upgrade, and even recycle weapons, and the way Bound by Flame does it is very good as ingridents aren't neither super rare nor super common and you can also make one use items yourself\n5. One of my favorite aspects of the game has to be the booby trap, because it does not only help you out a lot, but they can also be upgraded and relocated\n6. This is more of a pet peeve but one of the things I loved about this game was that the whole lighting of the rooms made sense and wasn't overwhelming to the eyes, also I love how your character just makes a flashlight out of themselves, while funny to think about, it's very functional\n7. The action menu, yeah the one that like makes you go like in slow mo, it's nice\n\n-Bad things:\n1. Your hitbox, in comparison to the enemies' is huge, like you could be meters away from an Ice Spirit and they'd still would hit you if they are using the ice wave spell... thing... yeah you know which\n2. The warrior stance is kinda useless? I mean it's very useful for when you are fighting enemies weaker than you, but in game there's no such thing unless you grind for three days straight you might be onto par with what you're facing\n3. The guardian flame and the fire wave spells are also pretty useless, since with the burning weapon you are inflicting the most damage in the same time and the fireball is the only long ranged attack that does a passable ammount of damage (the bow's not that good, prehaps not for me as I never actually used it but because I prefer up close combat)\n4. Merchants in general are over priced but like VERY overpriced\n5. No fast travel so you have to go from point A to point B facing the same respawning enemies\n6. Fire resistance sort of useless too\n7. You can only save different gameslots once you arrive to Valvenor I think\n\nII. Visuals\n-Good things:\n1. I love the loading screens, themselves make the whole wait worth it and are very stylish\n2. The cutscenes are very well animated, in fact better than the game sometimes, so I don't know if it's good or bad because sometimes it reminds me to PS1 and PS2 games in that aspect\n3. FINALLY AN ACTION GAME THAT HAS A PALLETTE THAT ISN'T JUST BROWN (although if anything it's very common throughout the game sooo)\n4. The in-game menus look very nice and contrasts very well\n\n-Bad things:\n1. Wierd lightning, like in dungeons and caves you can barely see anything, but in midday, specially in icy areas such as Steppes of Caraldthas and Blackfrost's Domain, the atmosphere is too bright\n2. The models look a bit clunky\n3. Reusing the same enemies, I put this on visuals because I feel they could've just given another model to certain enemies but keep the same mechanics working and it would be fixed, but like, it just feels dull, I mean they even reuse bosses as normal enemies later on, again, it's just due to aesthetics\n\nIII. Story/Dialogue\n-Good things:\n1. The characters, I mean personally I found myself liking the characters more than I did about the story\n2. Branching paths that determine your relationships with each character that also involves quests (though one flaw of this is that they can't really hate you unless you choose between Edwen or Rhelmar)\n\n-Bad things:\n1. The dialogues from time to time are very cheesy or flat out gritty mc edgy\n2. The lip syncing could get a little more work\n3. The story is very meh, but I feel as if this could also be a good thing, because let's say Sonic the Hedgehog, I mean sure the first games were like "Dr. Robotnik wants to take over the world, go stop him" they were safer that way, because no one actually plays it for the story, but more recent games for example Sonic '06 just complicates itself too much "Sun god wants to take over the world but his daughter, the princess can't cry but if she would everything would be okay, also you are a hedgehog that rescues her and she kisses you but like not really anyways" which is, to say the least bad. Though I do feel like this type of game would be fit to have a more complex story, although it's not all that swallow for quests add a bit to it\n4. The romance options aren't unisex. C'mon guys, this is 2016 (well at least it came out by 2014) but come on. It's a good game but why the f*ck can't I romance neither Rhelmar nor Randval with a male character? I spent ten f*cking hours or more trying to kill the two concubines with Rhelmar's weak *ss to "assist me". And what do I get???? Nothing. Like seriously guys, it's the twentiethfirst century y'all why can't I have a gay romance?\n5. Needs more Mathras\n\nLike I just hope you guys could like patch these things soon enough, or maybe even fix it with a sequel... well maybe not a sequel, itself the game's story feels complete, maybe a spin off or something","April 17","true","45.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Structurally, it’s largely linear; though smaller maps and quests can be explored and completed in different orders, it’s always constrained by narrow corridors and a fairly rigid plot.

The game was sometimes fun for what it was, but overall it was shallow and felt incomplete and rushed in so many spots.  And with the terrible, abrupt endings they made available, I will probably never trust or play another Spider game.  I know some people say endings like this are good because real life isn't always a happy ending, but screw that.  I game to escape my life for a while, forget coming out of the game more disgruntled than when I went in!  If you're going to pull what they did, at least make it feel meaningful!  At least it didn't depress me, I was never able to get attached to any of the characters - and I'm someone who ALWAYS gets emotionally invested in these things.\n\nThe game advertises that all your choices matter in determining whether you go demon or stay human, too, and that is absolutely not the case.  If you make one incorrect guess on a dialogue choice in one of three spots, you're screwed.  You can be a saint throughout the game and you'll still go demon.\n\nI also just noticed that I never encountered a couple of the mobs shown in the images on the game's store page, so either I was weirdly unlucky, they looked nothing in game like they're being advertised, or it was straight-up deceptive advertising.\n\nIn the end, if the game still interests you and it falls below $5.00, it'd be an ok diversion for a weekend if you don't expect much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/belialrus/recommended/243930/","belialrus","Belial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/belialrus/","133 products in account","Potentially outstanding RPG that fails in detail\n\nTake your average RPG. It starts with some redneck in a village or library, who suddenly finds himself in a middle of a quest to save the world. The guy has no experience, no motivation, no skills to survive, yet he presses on, driven by players desire for loot and motivated by an idea that he's the chosen one. A scenario that is impossible to swallow if you're at least 10 years old.\n\nReal life doesnt work quite like that. Bioware, that has set RPG staple has also set rules that doesnt leave a lot to work with. Mass effect, Dragon Age, Baldurs Gate, Neverwinter nights etc etc all start with basically the same tune, their only saving grace being masterfully written dialogue and intricate universe, that makes up for poor introduction.\n\nBound By Flame actually challenges that scenario quite well, unlike Dark Souls for example, who chose to take their own path, BBF follows in Bioware footsteps, however with a much better concept.\nYou are playing as a mercenary, someone, who’s life is battle and who doesn’t shy away from danger. Or adventure. You are not a loner - you are a part of a company with established hierarchy. Thus you don’t even have much choice on the matter. You get your orders and your orders go with the money.\nThe region faces an invasion from a force that is believed to be invincible. Situation that sellblades usually thrive on. (which sadly is not quite capitalized on by developers)\nInvaders - the Ice Lords employ endless legions of undead to raze all in its wake. In a desperate attempt to turn the tide a group of mages summon a demon to this world. A demon, who takes control of your body.\n\nNow all that is not especially original, but that kind of stories just sell themself.  Its a rich soil if you just play by the book\nMorally: Do you use this power for personal gain or greater good?\nMotive: Do you act quickly before the demon consumes you? Or do you try to tame the monster to do your bidding?\nConsequence: What is the price for power? To defeat a monster does one become a monster? And what comes after this?\nYou know, you got a lot of storytelling problems solved by the "demon" twist.\nUnfortunately, story cannot handle even this basic clichés . The demon turns out to be some sort of a greenpeace fanatic. All this possession stuff doesn’t get you anywhere and there is barely consequence to it, nor satisfactory explanation. The story is shallow and unsatisfying, leaving more questions that answers.\n\nYou character gruesome appearance, as the demon manifests and takes over his human body is barely noticed by npc's. Your gain in power is irrelevant to your choices thus there is no risk, no reward - no consequence to your actions. It ends up an aesthetic feature, which is a waste.\nVoice acting is often criticized but I found it bearable. In fact its not the voice that’s annoying, but sheer amount of chatter every other person is willing to do. No matter what, I just couldn’t relate to any of the characters, who just don’t get enough time, neither enough personality. Witch is a *itch, Knight is stupid, Healer is unhappy, Elf is righteous. Oh there’s also a lich that looks just like that guy from "tales from the crypt" and is sort of fun to have around.\n\nDon’t get me wrong : the game has it all. Loot, skill trees, crafting, chatter between characters, npc quests. Romance even. But somehow it just doesn’t feel right. The reason is quite the same. No matter what you say or do your companions will act the same, say the same. You will never experience that "what if I picked another line" feeling that forced you to reload Bioware games a couple of times just to hear it all.\nConcept is great, but storytelling is terrible.\n\nA lot of stuff seems to be raw and unfinished. For example background chatter is vaguely introduced in the beginning of game, but quickly disappears.\n\nThe game is short. There are supposed to be 7 Ice Lords to defeat, but you only get to combat one.\nOn the bright side I found some features satisfying\nPC and Demon chatter - unfortunately demon is a little bit weird and talks way too much, but he's voiced nicely and at first it is thrilling to try to understand his motivation (well, until you do, afterwards it its a disappointment)\n\nDemonic appearance and Voice - transformation is handled nicely. Demonic voice and appearance look and sound intimidating. Unfortunately there is no one in game world to adore or tremble as NPC just fail to notice you're a horned burning creature.\n\nEarly bosses re-introduced later in the game. Some might argue that a boss should have a unique feeling to it. While thats true I loved the experience how much more powerful I've become. That bosses that I used to struggle in early game were that much easier to beat later on, I could take even two at once and survive, while fighting off skeletal henchmen.\n\nThat brings me to probably only things devs got "almost" right. Combat.\nCombat in this game is criticized as well, but I found it very rewarding once you've learned some tricks. There are two melee stances with a lot of defensive and offensive options: block, evade, guard crush, parry, counters, interrupts etc. The combat mechanic is hard to master and without mastering it you will get slaughtered painfully. Unlike most modern games if a monster knocks you down, the rest of the crowd doesn’t just stand there, but willingly rush to finish you before you can get up and defend. There is no invulnerability during attacks. If you're swarmed, you wont be able to strike, b/c your enemies will hit you before you reach them. Block to much – AI will guard crush you right away. Controlling combat space is difficult, fighting multiple enemies , even weak ones, is suicidal at harder settings. Overall combat feels very tough and feels very real. Every battle is dangerous and chaotic, there is no sequence that "wins" this monster, you are constantly threatened. It is difficult to break enemy line to get the archer without dying, but leaving him there is not an option as he will kill you quickly. It feels almost hopeless sometimes and is almost a matter of luck. The tools to beat your enemies are there, but they are so hard to master that battles feel ugly and stressful, like real combat should.\n\nHowever this design, (that not everyone would appreciate, of course) is plagued by two terrible oversights that ruin the fun and thats been long solved in most games : potion abuse and monster kiting. Potions are not exactly easy to obtain since they are expensive and there are never enough components. But still they are pretty spammable to a degree (they take some time to activate, so you have to get some distance between you and enemy before using one) Some kind of cooldown or "potion slots" would solve the problem, but... (by the way you can craft stuff during combat. "Hey big skeleton guy, would you give me some time, I gotta brew stuff" so dont bother to stock up before atacking some boss. Small oversight, but there are infinite numbers of them, that just add to the impression)\n\nMonster kiting is a little bit dumb. Every group is attached to an area, once they get outside that area they just stop trying to hit you, turn their backs and go home. Huh? So yeah. Exploitable.\nI wont list a huge list of small stuff  (like the one with combat crafting) - there is never ceasing feel of awkwardness that accompanies everything that's going on. still it is forgivable, what is not, that a great concept has been reduced to blank and shallow story.\n\nThe main disappointment with Bound by Flame is not its flaws, but that through them you can clearly see what kind of great game its aiming to be and its just killing the mood.","May 12, 2014","false","21.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

A highly mediocre RPG, it remains enjoyable once you've got used to the rather quirky nature of it all. Environmental design is great and together with a day and night cycle and good music create a solid atmosphere. Combat is incredibly hit and miss, feeling sluggish and clumsy while in the warrior stance, but fast and relatively fluid while stabbing your undead enemies back to death in the ranger stance. The story in Bound by Flame can be summed up as generic, and feels disjointed as it rapidly skips through major events while suffering from poor dialogue. Bound by Flame is an incredibly flawed gem, but one that may just be worthy of your time if you enjoy these types of action RPGs and can forgive it for having glaring, glaring problems.\n\nFully detailed video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiX5dPtehs","May 9, 2014","true","15.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

It's actually quite the opposite. It doesn't create a new experience but rather it seems to want to emulate what it thinks an RPG should have. Like a child, swinging around a toy sword, claming 'that's what the people on Game of Thrones do'.\n\nFrom its first trailers, the game promised a rich storyline, fun and varied combat and the big choice between power to overcome enemies or maintaining your humanity. While I can't talk about the last one, it's safe to say that it fails on the first two.\n\nDialogue and characters are bland at best, outright stupid at worst. Horrible writing, cheesy one-liners and a voice acting that makes The Room seem like Titanic make it a gruesome, facepalm-inducing experience. Coupled with the fact that the designers thought adding the f-word in the game would make it all better, makes it even worse. Most of the time any dialogue you have makes very little sense...i'm sorry... very little ♥♥♥♥ING sense. See what I did, writers? So no, that aspect falls flat on its ♥♥♥.\n\nWhat about the combat then? Well, you're in for a shock. That's a mess too. The biggest dismay of combat is its painfully slow pace. Enemies seem to have huge health bars, even the crappiest of scouts takes a number of hits to finally go down. Moreso, it lacks feedback. Whatever you hit won't react to the blow, won't be stunned or impeded unless the blow is specifically designed to (see the guard-dropping kick). However any attack on YOU will stunlock. So it will indeed feel like you're swinging a cardboard tube around. Want more? How about adding in a lock-on system that is horribly shoddy (lock on to an enemy, yet launching a fireball at another for no reason) ? Does that pique your interest? No? Who would've guessed...\n\nThe music is okay, but becomes repetitive early on, having the same menu tune pop up almost every other cutscene. However the graphics are beautiful, with the grim exception of human faces and lip-sync.\n\nAll in all, it's not a good game. Don't waste your money on something even Two Worlds or Risen can do a lot better!","May 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

They really make Bound by Flame look like an A+ game. It's not.\n\nSpoiler Alert!Ever play a game where you're given lots of options as to how to win? Of course you have. How about a game where every enemy is overpowered and you're weaker than a newborn baby with a pencil? Probably. BBF offers these kinds of things, but don't be fooled: those options are invalid. Yes, you heard it here. Now, maybe it's my opinion, but you can most likely get through the game by mashing the left mouse button to attack when necessary and the Q button when getting attacked. As long as you select and build the Ranger skill tree.\n\nExplanation of the Main Part of the GameSpeaking of which, the game offers two types of "classes" to use. Warrior, of which wields one of three weapons: Two-handed sword, axe, or hammer. Ranger, of which uses dual-daggers and a crossbow.\n\nSword offers highest attack speed, with no interrupt (a.k.a. knockback, which is actually important).\nAxe offers half of that attack speed and some interruption.\nHammer offers almost no attack speed (so ridiculously slow that you might be able to work your nine to five job and get back in time to hit the opponent) and all the interruption in the world (if you can actually hit your opponent before their attack goes through, then you can stop all of it).\nAs for Ranger? It's just dual-daggers that have all the attack speed and critical hits in the world, but literally no interruption.\nOh, and they have a crossbow that is almost completely useless.\nLittle mines/bombs are available, too, since your character is apparently a demolition expert, yet only has one type of bomb (I think I missed my chance with the other type).\nLastly, your fire abilities, of which I only found like two or three to be useful.\nNow for why this is all useless. Slowly throughout the game, sword becomes useless, then axe becomes useless, then hammer becomes useless, then daggers become the God of all weapons. Without Ranger and bombs being built, you'll have trouble on the last boss, which plays completely differently from every other enemy you've encountered so far. So it's like a whole new game. Even mashing Q won't save you all the time, but it will most the time. Point is, you will not win the battle using Warrior. Then again, maybe if you spend an hour or two on him, you will?\n\nDo I recommend this game?There is so much more to say, but that is the main thing I wanted to share. Even with all of the faults of the game, I had a lot of fun. For full price, it is not worth it. For half price, no. For less than ten bucks? Sure. Good time killer, fun hack and slash that isn't TOO difficult, hilariously bad dialogue and voice acting, and decent graphics.","December 30, 2015","true","18.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It could be compared to that of the Witcher 2, but more fluid and with a few more options. It is actually VERY fluid, very responsive with it's stance dance between sword and dagger with some magic available for use in either stance on account of our uninvited 'guest'. The options for customising how your character functions through armor/weapon augments and skill trees are fairly broad, though I WAS left with the impression that the game had an unintentional 'better' way to do things. That being said, I believe the game is playable and beatable using any playstyle available within.\n\nThe monsters... FEEL monstrous. Even on the second difficulty level I found that I would be easily killed by even a single enemy if I didn't use the block and dodge features given to me. And the bosses definitely feel bossy. Without careful manipulation of the boss mechanics, you WILL die. Painfully.\n\nThe visuals leave something to be desired. On the highest settings the graphics were comparable to that of the console release of Dragon Age: Origins. Possibly even of slightly less quality. I often found choppy edges, armor and weapons clipping with each other. Even texture clipping in stationary environmental objects (come on, really?). There was definitely room for improvement here.\n\nThe voice acting is hit and miss. It seems to fluctuate between great and averagely average. Some of it was downright awful, and the lip syncing is very badly done. Sometimes the characters' faces don't even move! There is only one character who's voice acting is consistently awesome, and it sadly isn't the player character. The game's text is plagued with grammatical errors and some of the subtitles are entirely missing. The thing most frustrating though is sometimes the audio files play twice, or don't even play at all. It doesn't happen often, but when it does you'll be facepalming every time.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that, as the game is a multiplat with THREE consoles releases, it seems to interface was built with a gamepad in mind and thusly, the game feels a lot more intuitive and responsive with a supported gamepad. It is definitely playable with a keyboard and mouse, but the learning curve is so steep that I honestly found myself digging out my wired XBOX 360 controller just to get into the game without having the obstacle of learning the somewhat obtuse keyboard layout, or having to remap everything.\n\nOverall though, I feel this game deserves a 7/10. The game has room for improvement, but with a good story, great combat and decent customisation, it has a lot to offer any RPG player.","May 20, 2014","true","52.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

While there is a tremendous amount of visual polish and the interface/HUD are well-designed to handle the myriad of abilities, information, crafting, etc. that the game contains, the game underneath falls far short of that presentation.\n\nBound by Flame attempts to tap into the "tough-but-fair" gamer demographic, with punishing combat even on the easiest difficulty setting. Unfortunately, a limited moveset and HP-sponge enemies make every single encounter an obnoxious test of both the player's dexterity and patience. The crafting and resource management system does nothing to redeem this flaw - equipment can be upgraded in a variety of ways, but these upgrades have no discernible impact on the combat. Perhaps the most major flaw is the writing & voice acting: the dialogue is incredibly redundant, tropey, and delivered in either a tepid monotone or an exaggerated facsimile of genuine emotion. The lines are synced to animations in-game, which means that almost every conversation has long, awkward pauses while a character finishes waving their hands in the air.\n\nPerhaps graphically-oriented gamers with an enormous lust for grind will find this game entertaining, but for most there will be nothing to engage after an hour reveals the limited extent of the core mechanics.","May 7","false","2.9"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","14","24","2","2"

No, but it is far from the worst. it is a fun RPG and i think people are to harsh on the game cause people have grown to have high standards for any game but especially RPGs. Now i bought this game on sale for $6 and if you can get it on sale i would recommend trying it out for yourself but i don't think it's worth $30. It is a fun game but there are some flaws to the game which make the game worse its combat is like a worse Witcher and the game is challenging and for that it makes the game much better the fights are pretty fun because a lot of the types of monsters have a unique fighting skill. So overall i would say it's a 6.5/10 or so i would say it's in the middle you can get worse RPGs but you can get much better aswell.","December 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Never had the problem of being overburdened with shallow sidequests. It's pretty easy to fail them compared to other RPGs I've played if you aren't paying close attention, but I kind of liked that. Not many games dare to do that.\n- Pretty good sound track. There are some very memorable tracks in there.\n- Voice acting is good (except for the main female voice sometimes! Criiinge), one of the character's voices sounds like it came from one of the Divinity games. That was an extra plus point for me.\n- Combat difficulty: I know this won't be to everyone's liking but, I like games that don't let me mindlessly button-mash, and make me careful about engaging a group of enemies. It's very reflex based, and you have to pay close attention to what the enemy is doing and is about to do. It feels very rewarding when you've timed it right and earned your chance to attack. This way you don't feel completely powerless and weak.\n\nNeutral:\n- Choice options. Sometimes they were nice and felt significant. Other times choosing one thing didn't seem to make a difference (just a slight detail is different).\n-  Gameplay concepts: Interesting ideas, a lot of potential like in night & day rotation, possession and theme of fighting for your identity, crafting and traps, modding your weapons and armor. However, it falls a little short. Not enough development time?\n- Story. It had an interesting setting, but too much of a focus on the main villains. More could have been done to get players immersed in the world. Important cities and people, more narrative, more story about the adventure.\n\nNegatives:\n- Characters: A little cliché. One character in particular seems like a copy of a certain other character from the Dragon Age series, voice acting and all. Not enough time for the characters to develop. It's a shame, because I did develop some feeling near the end, but not enough to care greatly about them.\n- Graphical glitches and models get into strange positions sometimes. (Like when talking to a companion while sneaking, they end up with a very bad posture!)\n- Too short\n- Combat stances: You can switch between warrior (2 handed weapon) and ranger stance (daggers) in battle. I ended up completely ignoring the warrior stance at some point and just relied on ranger. I felt like this could have been developed a little better, to make it so that you would need to switch between the two depending on the situation, otherwise they should have just made it class based, imo.\n\nAll in all, still an enjoyable experience. Not amazing, had some major dissapointments, but still kept me engaged. I know the developers don't comprise of a large team, but I can see potential. Would recommend getting it on sale.","December 10, 2015","true","16.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HatchXXII/recommended/243930/","HatchXXII","@HatchXXII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HatchXXII/","237 products in account","The role-playing systems that support the combat in Bound By Flame are simple, but quite effective. Your character has three skill trees, labeled Warrior, Ranger, and Pyromancer, but effectively serving as a slow sword, fast daggers, and spells. Combat stances can be toggled on-the-fly mid-battle, with your selection of fire spells being available in both. I found I spent most of the early game in the defensive Warrior stance, but finished the bulk of the campaign using the speedy Ranger daggers. Every progression choice felt like a viable play-style though, allowing me to find what I liked, and exploit it to the fullest.\nMuch of Bound By Flame’s combat is built around timing and precision, like when you face opponents who carry shields on their front and their back. You’ll need to either hit them from their flanks with daggers, or best them with perfectly-timed blocks and counter-attacks. The notably responsive controls are up to the task, conveying the rhythms of one-against-many combat surprisingly well. The same can’t be said for some of the single-opponent fights though, which can be either predictable and easy, or downright cheap, though those are happily quite rare.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ShF9iAhxQ\n\n\n\n\nBound By Flame creates a bleak fantasy world, which it attempts to fill with a grimy, cynical perspective and dark humor. Sadly, neither the writing or voice acting are strong enough to quite pull off these ambitious storytelling goals. Its mercenaries are unsurprisingly profane and written to be amusingly juvenile, but their bawdy insults and nasty jokes are only clever half the time.The other half they fall flat thanks to wildly inconsistent voice acting and writing, which often wind up being unintentionally amusing.\nOn the plus side, much of the rest of Bound By Flame’s presentation worked well. I quite liked most of the music, particularly some of the arrhythmic, drum-based tracks used during more demonic battles. The character models and animations are strong as well, particularly on the smooth-running PC version. Bound By Flame has one huge strength: the harmony between its entertaining combat and role-playing systems.ound By Flame’s combination of progression and action ultimately make it greater than the sum of its parts.","May 13, 2014","true","7.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And RPG is my favorite genre.\nSo here we go. Bound by flame is a demonic fantasy world RPG with so big potential and so amazing universe. The game follows Vulcan (regretfully, although you are asked at the beginning of the game about your name, you are Vulcan...) pretty interesting character who has a demon inside him. The first bad thing that you will meet is the mediocre voice of the NPC's and of the main hero. There are some not that good jokes and insults along the way but if you don't really dig into it, you will be fine. The good thing though is that the voice changes as you choose what to be - a good hero or a bad demon.\nThe game takes you to pretty different quests and nasty creatures. The cool thing about this RPG is that it's pretty intense and you go along with people who helps you along the way. The bad thing is that the combat system is pretty hard and really, really hard to expert. The bosses are hard sometimes and if you jump directly to higher difficulties, you will be pretty annoyed, but there are much games with bigger expectations and budget and are a worse.\nGiven the fact that it's almost an indie project with a new, small studio developing the game, I really enjoyed it and I recommend it to RPG fans. I don't share with the general opinion that the game is not worth it. I hope that there are more projects like that one so you don't play all along the same thing everyday.\n","April 28","true","6.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm a huge RPG fan, so I like games ranging from Baldur's Gate to Neverwinter Nights to Dragon Age: Inquisition. I bought this game to try it out because it looked like fun, it was an RPG like Dragon Age, and, well, I'm a sucker for romancing NPC party characters, which it promised to let you do. It's got some flaws, such as your character being bland and cussing a lot as well as linear world settings and creatures spawning like they're in a dungeon and your character dying a lot due to stupid things like the battle AI and weird voice acting mixed with a limited amount of dialogue, but it's fun. I like talking to some of the characters and learning their back stories. I like the idea of deciding between being a messed up human with a demon inside you or turning into a demon. The storyline is pretty cool; drew me in enough to get 20 hours of gameplay out of me. I like the battle system where you get to choose three types of classes and then mix em all to beat up the enemies. I like that you can craft potions and items and do get chances to befriend/romance/enemy characters that you meet. It's quite a strange game. It's got it's flaws and it's got good things about it that set it apart from other games. As my husband calls it: it's an Indie Dragon Age and I kinda agree with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGGViking/recommended/243930/","TheGGViking","TheGGViking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGGViking/","96 products in account","So ive just finished the game myself and for me its an extremely mixed bag. SPOILER WARNINGS.\n\nCOMBAT\nThe combat system in general is actually pretty nice. It takes away from the standard hack and slash type games and goes for a more defensive style, but doesnt curb stomp you too hard if you dont get the learning curve right away. The best way I can sum it up is it feels like Dark Souls if it was easier. However dont let the review quotes fool you into thinking its much more in depth than it seems. When they say multiple combat styles, what they really mean is two: Warrior which focuses on blocking, counter attacking, using two-handed weapons, and kicks to stagger enemies and Ranger, using two daggers in quick rapid combos, dodging and a stealth mechanic. There is a third skill tree to go down, Pyromancy, yes fire type magic is the only kind you use in this game but it comes in several options for offense and defense so its in a way a varying utility tree.\n\nIn essance, the combat system can be a bit rough, especially for new players. It punishes you for mistakes so either learn your mistakes quickly or change your strategy. As I said, it feels like a Dark Souls game where every hit you take counts, positioning matters, and good reaction times are keys to winning. The options for making your own play style are there, but honestly in my opinion, they feel unfinished. The weapons for Warrior stance are Swords which are quick but weak weapons, Axes are a bit stronger and have better crit rating but are slower, and Hammers which are the slowest but stagger enemies more often. Rangers are limited to using only daggers and you also come with a hand crossbow and trap bombs you can lay about. You are allowed to craft addons into your weapons and armor with materials, anything from increasing damage, crit rate, staggering chance, physical resistance, magic resistance, etc. So farming up materials is important. You are also allowed to take one companion with you amoung the ones you meet along the way, each of them having pros and cons so it really makes you have to choose wisely for the best one suited to the task.\n\nSTORY\nThis was a very major point that could make or break the game.....and unfortunately for me it broke. The base of the story is that a group of mages grew so powerful they became the Ice Lords of Frozen Shadow, blanketting most of the world in ice and raising the undead into armies to take control of what little the humans and elves have left. Naturally this adds a sense of dread. Combined with the difficulty of the game, the feeling of this impending doom always looming over you really inhances the experiance of making every resource count. The undead have you and the little allies you have pinned in a corner and youll feel like a rat in a maze while a snake follows just behind.\n\nSPOILER WARNING\nYou play as the explosive expert in a group of mercenaries called the Freeborne Blades and you have been hired by a group of scholar/mages called the Red Scribes. Your job is to protect them while they perform a ritual that could turn the tide of the war. Everything is quiet until, uh oh, the undead start to raid the temple and you have to defend it. Pretty much in a nut shell, the Red Scribes summon a fire demon and it chooses your body to be its host. After this happens, you and your company have to travel across the land to get them to the elven city. Inbetween there you meet several characters that become party members. Once you reach your goal, you find that the elven city has been taken by one of the Ice Lords and your role in the war isnt over just yet.\n\nOk so here are the mega spoilers if you really wanna keep more to yourself.\n\nThe game is always throwing at you and reminding you that there are several Ice Lords, but you only fight two depending on your ingame choices. This was incredibly game breaking as they build up that you are the savior of the land that wields the flame of the world itself to take down the ice lords, and you only have to really kill one of them before going onto the final boss. Hell, you dont even SEE the rest of them. All you get is their names and I dont know if this was suppose to be a set up to future games or not, but in my eyes its alot of story and build up for a whole lotta nothing. What happens when you beat that Ice Lord? What are the rest of them doing while you are doing that? Lots of questions and no answers leaves a player stranded on an island without even so much as a palm tree to sit under. Its barren and this is why I say it feels unfinished. So much wasted potential for so little a reward.\nSPOILER END\n\nAll in all, I thought the story was quite nice, the characters were alright but most could use some polishing up to make you really dig into them and their lives. There isnt much interacting besides doing some quests for them now and again and beyond that just talking about them or asking them questions on the situation. Nothing really holds you or gets you truely involved with them. Even the romance sections are lack luster so dont believe the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t review that says its like Mass Effect only in a differant setting. Its not even close by a long shot, but all I can say is it was a good try.\n\nGRAPHICS AND SOUND\nThe graphics can be a bit annoying at times when it flares up in brightness from sun shining through the trees or a patch of ice with mist around it starts glowing white, and turning down the brightness makes everything darker so its up to the player. The textures are decent in my opinion, the facial hair was very nice by actually making it look scruffy and rough rather than just a smooth shape. The character design options are slim so youll have to make do with the best you can but in the end it feels good enough to get by.\n\nThe music is very nice, though sometimes it can cut over the voice acting if you leave it at max. The voice acting itself feels alright, but again unfinished and needs polish. Some characters sound too stoic and others arnt expressing enough and it can kill immersion quite a bit. The sound effects such as hacking with your weapons was actually rather nice and I enjoyed them, it made it feel rough and real instead of the regular sleek sounds you normally think of with swords.\n\nFINAL JUDGEMENT\nWith everything I experianced from the story telling to the combat system, characters and game mechanics I would say it is worth getting, but never at full price as its not worth that much. I would say get it at at least 50% off or more, that way you are getting your monies worth. There is FAR too much story left out of the game and its alot shorter than your going to want it to be which leaves you disappointed. The multiple choices you make have some impact, but it doesnt feel like they have any weight to them so it will make you wonder what differance it really made and that takes away from the replay ability. You would probably play this game twice at minimum, the second time making all the opposite choices just to satisfy your curiosity but thats about it so dont expect anything really major, the game is far too short to carry anything substantial.\n\nMy advice, buy at your own risk if you want a good challange, decent characters and story, and a good time killer just dont expect anything ground breaking or award winning as this game is sorely lacking in those departments.\n\nThe short version: 6/10","May 2","true","21.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I rushed main quest with a few importnt sidequests and at the end of my 11h hours of play, I have determined that this game cost unfortunately too much for what it is worth.\n\nGraphics are okay (let's not talk about lip sync) but a bit to much year 2000 according to the new RPGs who got out recently. The game is very generic, not much of an open world but the story still makes it enjoyable (Although we end up beating only 1 of the 7 Ice Lords)\n\nIn my opinion, the "Choice of good or evil" is kinda false because first you cannot beat the game without those OverPowered fireballs critics on the bosses at melee range, and also with the few skill points we get to fill the trees, the "ranger" part is a bit left on the side since the stealth feature is  not so useful at all, nor the crossbow or even traps.i have beat this game with raw power and the demon's magic.\n\nMaybe 20 diff main weapons. Blunts and axes are not good enough compared to the swords wich makes em useless. I have seen 6 sort of crossbows and 7 sorts of daggers. Maybe 5 or 6 Sets of armor, wich doesn't have much difference between them. Returning to the main weaapon section, not enough emphasis on those "unique weapons" (Mjollnir, dragon's eye or something) and these "unique" ones weren't good enough to match my common sword found in a merchant.\n\nTeh craft feature is interesting but not enough exploited since i was able to sell some tainted items found randmly for 10k and i bought 200 of each potion, wich made the crafting completely useless at the half of the game since the crossbow and traps gives less DPS and less Interrupting than my Warrior Stance skills.\n\nMusics and Audios were pretty dam cool, the music in the BlackFrost mansion is quite cool with the chorus tone vocals.\n\nAnd at last, every bosses should have been as hard/long as the  last one. Gives more challenge. The bosses/mini bosses were completely and purely parry, critic, fireball. no features, no doppelganging, no mirror images, no doubles. And the 4 Concubines were a joke to handle.\n\nI feel like this game is n indie game that I would have bought for 20 bucks on featured steam sales, but i still enjoyed the game. good elements. good fights. tactical moving.\n\nAnd GOD. Please add some rolls in fight. In every bloody cinematics our protagonist rolls all over to avoid hitss and yet in fight i wasnt able to make a roll dodge or anything. not even when blocking/parrying. makes us hard to fight against those cold woman with 2 swords and 4 arms !\n\nThis game wouldn't suffer of a faster paced action fighting though, i felt kinda slow at the very start !","May 9, 2014","true","11.8"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","27","50","0","0"

If you are like me, trudging through rpg wasteland and awaiting big name releases, BBF should keep you entertained.\n\nDetailed impressions (Long read)\n\nGender picking and customisation\nYou can pick male or female, that's always nice. However, don't expect detailed customisation. Customisation is very limited and I mean limited. You can only choose from 5 preset faces and hairstyle for each sex.\n\nGraphics\nGraphics are dated even on highest settings but passable. Cutscenes are a little jerky too and feel as though multiple scenes were just strung together to create the final one. But remember it’s not a AAA game.\n\nCombat\nCombat is a toned downed hybrid of Witcher, dark souls and Kingdoms of amalur. You run around, block hits before proceeding to hack away at your enemies. Blocking or dodging precisely when the enemies blade hits yours grants you an automatic counterattack. Combat is a little chunky at times and you will likely end up spamming the same attacks to finish off your prey. Dodge, attack and repeat. Similar to war logs, the radical wheel returns. Bringing up the wheel allows you to employ abilites and traps (Think witcher).\n\nCompanions, Voice acting and conversations.\nTHANK GOD for the much better voice acting. It is still sub-par but better than the ones they employed for Mars war logs. Companions are Bioware style. A total of 5 can be picked up. Conversations with your party are also Bioware style. Talk to them, discover more about them, agree or anger them. Nothing groundbreaking but they did a decent job. Much like all standard PRGs, you can learn more about the world if you bother to talk to NPCs.\n\nCrafting and the world\nCrafting is where the game really shines. You can craft anything and everything. Don't like the handle of your sword? Craft one. Hate your spaulders or shin guards? Craft one. (Yes, armour is not a one piece suit). Every single armour and weapon customisation was modelled so enjoy the variety. The world is hub based much like Dragon age Origins but freely explorable within those boundaries. Materials for crafting are littered throughout the map, coated with a shiny gloss so give your eyes peeled.\n\nEDIT: After spending a considerable amount of time in the game, i think it's time to talk about the choices you can make.\nThe game does not shepard you into obvious colour coded choices (Mass effect) and decisions are significant, much like the original dragon age and mass effect. Every so often in the game, the demon within you surfaces and allows you to make a choice. Suppressing it or allow the demon to consume you are significant plot choices and WILL affect your story and companions. As a demonic being, you can undertake some absolutely appalling decisions and you will have to live with the repercussions.","May 8, 2014","true","29.0"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","28","52","0","0"

Meta and review scores are insulting - the game is way better than lots of modern AAA titles.\n\nGreat: music, gameplay, story. Crafting system deserves a medal. Each weapon and armor has its own list of upgrades that actually look different. Your choices make difference and there are several endings. Combat is smooth and challenging, mostly skill based - you can't really grind and try again, you have to use different strategy or lower the difficulty which you can do at any time.\n\nGame is also not open-world. Its very linear and small, which is its best part - where other games make you run around and just lose time - this game just gives you concentrated fun. Good for gamers who value their time. 10-15 hours to complete.\n\nThe game has its flaws but if you aren't picky you wouldn't even notice them: Voice acting gets better later on, deaths and strong enemies are to be expected and if you don't compare it to other games it wouldn't annoy you with similarities. Oh and play it with gamepad, its much smoother that way.\n\nOverall - highly recommended. On sale - must buy if you like challenging combat and enjoy learning from your deaths.","April 22, 2015","true","26.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Just a couple sentences after the boss and a forced choice. No gameplay after the story(wasn't expecting it); no NG+(the game is short enough that it's not a huge issue). It could have been a much longer experience with a much larger game world; the backstory was there. Still, way better and more fun that I was expecting it to be.\n\nHaving played through the game more than once now, I'm going to review further. The original review is above, the extra is below.\n\nThe game has a few weird flaws that make the game harder than it probably should be, or maybe it has a broken stance that makes the game much easier due to shortsightedness. The warrior stance relies almost entirely on parrying to avoid damage, which is a block executed in a pretty tight timeframe that leads to a counter.\n\nThere are several moves that are not blockable in the game, that can easily be dodged, even without the specific timing, by the other stance. Now, I don't know if they forgot to make block better in the warrior stance, or they overlooked how good dodging is by comparison, but the game is much, much easier when you play through wielding daggers in the stealth stance than it is playing through with heavy weapons in the warrior stance. That was painfully clear when I did a heavy weapon only run on Captain difficulty.\n\nAnother thing is that the story doesn't really make it feel like my choices mattered outside of a different line of dialogue here and there. Almost all of the game was the same no matter what I chose to do. The one that sticks out the most is at the end of act II when you have to choose whether to ambush a specific deadwalker or go save the troops who are about to be ambushed themselves. No matter which choice you make here, you fight the deadwalker. the choice only changes which companion you fight it with, and alters an encounter later in the game. I was expecting, with so many choices, for there to be more divergence in the story depending on them.\n\nHaving seen all of the endings, only one of them felt even remotely satisfying. the other endings leave much to be desired and bring about no closure at all.\n\nIn spite of these flaws, I obviously spent a great deal of time with the game, and I felt driven to get all of the achievements(working on the last two now). I bought this game on a whim and I am satisfied with the purchase. I do still wish the story was a little more fleshed out, though. A sequel set in a more open would would be welcome.","July 10, 2014","true","44.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/243930/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Bound by Flame is a 3rd Person Action RPG by Spiders Studios. You play as a mercenary who must save his land from a walking dead army through the use of powers granted to you by a demon.\n\nBound by Flame is very rough around the edges, full of "jank" as some lovingly, or not so lovingly, describe. It is evident in myriad ways, from the dialog, to animation, to overall plot of the story. This is not some extremely polished AAA title, but it is not without its charm. Ultimately it had enough of that charm to keep me playing until I completed the story.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Legend of Zelda, or a very paired down God of War. There are no combos, kill streaks, or anything of that sort. You can parry, block and dodge attacks; choose from 3 main strong style weapons (axe, hammer, sword); try stealth mode with daggers; or use a small selection of fire-based spells to attack your enemies. Combat can go a little slow at times, with some enemies having a lot of health, and I found myself at times running around in circles so I could slowly heal or chug some health potions. Your companions are mostly useless, but the one that casts healing spells can come in handy at times. Overall, I wouldn't call the combat the game's strongest point, since it can get very repetitive. There is not much variety in types of attacks, and you will be battling the same types of enemies over and over and over.\n\nThe graphics in Bound by Flame are impressive for a smaller studio. There are glitches here and there with the occasional floating piece of armor, but overall I liked the way the world looked. Some of the character faces are a little bland, but I liked the look of most of the enemies.\n\nThe dialog and voice work was probably my favorite part of the game. There is a very peculiar sense of humor present in this game, with the hero never beyond dropping a witty one line when the option presents itself. I did find the frequent use of curse words to be quite funny, because who wouldn't want to drop an F bomb at an Ice Lord trying to take over your realm.\n\nThe story is not something that hasn't been seen before. You can see bits and pieces of other works present in the plot, but overall it works. I was a little surprised when the game ended, because it seemed like everything was just wrapped up a little too quickly and there were still many threats that were discussed but never addressed. Also, the endings didn't really do enough to tell you what happened. Some major characters were just never mentioned at all. One ending just cuts to the credits without really giving you any idea of what was going to happen. That was disappointing.\n\nOverall, Bound by Flame is a game I can recommend, but just barely. I believe its short length works in its favor, because although there still seemed like there was much to do in Vertiel, there wasn't enough variety in combat and enemy types to keep me wanting to do it much longer. I enjoyed the ride for what it was, a campy 10-15 hour fantasy RPG.\n\nGrade: B-","January 14, 2015","true","9.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

This mainly happened in the swamp and around the final area called Black Frosts Domain.\n\nTip for better companion fighting: They are a bit weak in the health department so you being the hero need to aggro and eliminate the stronger more deadlier enemies first, while your doing this your companion may thank you with a nice ice blast or if your lucky some mind control. If they do die and you find yourself a bit deep, run away and let them get back on their feet - you may be quick enough to revive your companion before the enemy you are fighting gets their health back.\n\nNow in terms of general combat, yes it is hard but you need to practice and I mean practice. Some fights you will not win unless you can use the Q key to dodge while in Assassin stance or use SPACE while in Warrior stance to parry. Timing is essential with these and with good practice you may not even be hit. Once you understand and have achieved this sense of timing then things become very rewarding when you beat a tough fight. Focus carefully on the skill tree as well, don't scramble your points. Try and focus on your preferred fighting style while utilising the best pyro branches for that style of choice. Do not forget about your other stance how ever, do feel free to try and balance the weaker stance out by going for what is needed, remember your main stance is your offensive stance.\n\nHope this helped in some way in regards to the combat up roar, the game really is a nice one to play and has great choices for you to develop the plot/story. Graphics are not up there in the top of the list but some areas still look stunning and there are some errors with the subtitles like wrong words but after some time you don't pay attention to them.

I bought this game after reading a review that called it a medival fantasy version of Mass Effect which is just an insult to the Mass Effect series. This game is nowhere near the standard of Mass Effect in any aspect of its gameplay or story.\n\nThis games two biggest let downs are the wooden voice acting and the graphics that resemble a late PS2 or Xbox game. The voice acting is just terrible and does nothing for immersion and the worst part is, one of the worst voice actors in the game is that of the main character who just looks like an aging veteran warrior and sounds like a ridiculous american teenager.\n\nWhen it comes to combat this game is just about adequet but by no means great or even good. There is a noticeable delay after blocking or attacking that becomes quite annoying after a while and the camera either zooms out to far or zooms in so far that you can't even see whats going on mid combat.\n\nHaving only played about 90 minutes I havnt seen a great deal of the story but what I did see was quite average. Nothing to write home about. It's obviously inspired by Game of Thrones in that its about a Northern Ice king with an army of dead soldiers marching south. Sadly though, the quality leaves a lot to be desired..\n\nAll in all, this game is very average and not worth the rather large price tag. If you wan't to play this game i recommend waiting for a steam sale because its worth no more than $10,00 imo.\n\nAll things considered, I give this game a 6/10 - Mediocre.","May 16, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But then the surreal expectations will be thrust upon you as you have to almost single handedly clear out waves of enemies that take a quarter of your HP in one hit. As if that isn't bad enough? now there are random enemies that are randomly scattered and shoot at you from whichever crevice they hide in or throw you off as you're trying to doge attacks from a mob of 5 enemies that will kill you if you screw up once.\n\n\n\nI regret letting my friend talk me into this game.

A big part of why the combat feels bland/boring is the lack of stagger/reactions from your enemies when being hit by your attacks. Whilst fighting, a huge lash of your blade to the chest won't even budge your enemy whatsoever which makes your hits feel weak and meaningless (and yes, I'm aware that there is a stat called "Interrupt" that adds a chance of interrupting enemy animations to your attacks but that's not what I mean. Even without having a specific stats your attacks should give visual feedback). I mean, you can walk up to a naked archer and whack at him with a giant two-handed axe and the archer won't even notice, he'll just keep firing 1000000 damage arrows directly at your face.\nThe combat is difficult but not in a Dark Souls II way, it's mainly difficult because of how cheap your enemies are. You can't easily interrupt them and you often get swarmed with archers shooting a million projectiles at you whilst you try and fight off guys with annoying shields and other fast-attacking skeletons. I suggest playing in the ranger stance as the "Dodge" ability it provides actually allows you to win fights. Oh, and companions are terrible.\n\nAfter putting more time into this game I am unfortunately going to have to change my rating to a "No". This game is not worth 40 euros, heck it's not even worth 20 since it's basically unplayable. An ARPG with a terribly flawed combat system is basically rendered meaningless, since combat is all it had going for it in the first place.","May 8, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","16"

It's story, outside the initial premise is weak, the worldbuilding is weak, and the dialouge even weaker. Furthermore, the game is amazingly short, with only about 10 to 15 hours of play in it, and all of it is completly linear. And this is in an age when most in RPG's are at least 2 to 3 times that length.\n\nIt's combat is unpolished and easily exploited against you, as many enemies, even the most basic, can kill you quite easily. This might have been a intentional choice, in order to make it apeal to the Dark Souls crowd, but the combat is difficult because all of two enemies (and occasionally a single boss character) can stun lock you until you die, or get bored and settle for 75% of your health bar. This might have worked if their was a decent block or dodge feature, but there really isn't, as the dodge function you are given only allows for jumps backwards, and you lose space to back up very quickly.\n\nAll in all, while the games obvious budget constraints do give it some leeway, this is not a title I would recomend. The game, outside it's initial premise and it's visually interesting darkside curruption meter, is a bore. if you feel that you must try it, rent it for Xbox or PS4.","May 9, 2014","false","24.0"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

In the age of Fallout, Witcher, Skyrim, etc., RPGs we often go into games labelled as RPGs expecting them to have more in common with their big brothers.  This is a very much linear RPG with choices that do make somewhat of a difference.  There are side quests and a basic crafting system for improving the swords you have.  I do have to warn you though that it is best played on easy (in my opinion).  Combat can be a bit clunky and enemies don't go down quickly.  I wouldn't call this a hack and slash RPG, more like a hack, slash, block, and counter RPG.  Player skill is important here and the simplest enemy can overtake you if you expect to go in swinging.\n\nIn conclusion, at -80% off, I would indeed reccomend this game.

While hearing people I trusted saying that the game was a fun ride, I still couldn't help, but be swayed away by the people slamming this game to the floor as if the game was a buggy, unfinished, abomination. So finally, I took the risk and got something in return.\n\nNo build up to anything really, I just got something.\n\nBound By Flame is a good game, a good game with at times a bad camera, unforgiving difficulty, voice acting that ranges from okay to absolutely atrocious, a somewhat cliched story, but still a good game. Yeah, that does sound like a laundry list that would make any game mediocre, but honestly, in some weird hipster way, it adds to the charm of the game and the gameplay is pretty neat too.\n\nCombat is not easy, the game really does require you to time your attacks and dodge accordingly. Set traps for enemies, healing yourself, using your NPC partners as punching bags where you can hide from your enemies; All play a crucial part whether you die in three hits or not. Fair warning, don't use the sword, you'll die quicker than you are supposed to. Focus all of your energy on both daggers and pyromancy, It'll do you some good.\n\nThat's really about it, the combat is super solid, but also not the most amazing thing in the world. It makes you think a little bit though instead of completely going mental. Oh, last I forget, like some of the people mentioned in the reviews. The last boss is not easy. It really isn't. Its not completely insane, but it does test everything in your capacity.\n\nPick it up, 40 bucks a little steep though, for 20 and less it's a steal.","December 29, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plus, the voice acting wasn't too bad.\n\nLet me set the record straight by saying that I throuroughly enjoyed playing this game, while it lasted, but I'm quite mixed with my review.\n\nThe Good I really enjoyed the graphics. I had to turn them down slightly to better suit my PC, but that wasn't a problem, it still looked excellent.\n\nThe fighting style was great, you could choose how you wanted to fight (if you wanted to sharp-shoot with magic you could, or you could just middle-click to constantly lock on to play like LoL). You had the ability to use a crossbow, but it was an ability, not a weapon - which is strange.\n\nThe battles were fair. Unlike a lot of other games, you grew in power at nearly the same rate as the baddies did progressively. I feel like a lot of the negative reviews for this game are because of the difficulty of the final parts, but that's to be expected - it is meant to be a challenge, and you are given ample time to prepare.\n\nThe choice system didn't just use what you said to people. It used everything, inclusing the quests you choose to do/not do, which had an effected the player right throughout the game, making it harder or easier in battle, depending on your choices.\n\nThe choices you made don't have an immdiate effect, so they integrated with the story much better.\n\nThere is no way of knowing if you made good or bad choices (a la Mass Effect), because there is no system. This may seem like it should be in the negatives, but I believe it allows the player a much more fluid experience, without immediately tagging you as good or bad - you can be whoever you want to be. There isn't necessarily a good or bad.\nThe Bad The final choice didn't have enough impact. This is what bothered me the most. When you make your final choice, all you see is you enacting said choice, then the credits roll. You never get hit by the true scale of the choice you made. There was a bigger impact when I decided which way I went into Valvenor at the end of first the act! I would have liked to see what happened next, whether that be in a future game or DLC, I don't really mind. The fact that it just ends with the credits makes it seem like the writers were just trying to be artistic, using omission instead of closure in an attempt to leave you alone in your thoughts to think about what you've done, but that just doesn't work - at least not on this generation of gamers.\n\nThe game was too short for me. Like I said before, I did enjoy it while it lasted, but I feel like the story could have been longer. This said, though, the story was very complete. If you took the time to get to know it, it was all explained. Plus there was something of a codex, but it wasn't long and tiresome like Mass Effect. However, I wasn't able to stretch out the story long enough to actually be connected to the characters compared to other games like Mass Effect (I keep referencing Mass Effect, but it's true). This ties back into the final choice, I simply didn't care enough about the people I affected.\n\nThe ambient battles were repetitive and boring. When I was going to go do a sidequest before starting the 'end quest' of an act, I had to wade through the monsters that had re-spawned so many times, because I had to pick up the quest, then go do the quest, then come back from the quest and complete it. It seemed like an attempt to lengthen the game, but it was just irritating.\n\nI often found it hard to follow the story. I don't know if it's just me personally, but somebody would start talking to me, and I would be presented with an option to reply, and I just had no idea what to do. More often than not, I chose an option that went against the predisposition I had decided in the beginning. Although, I suppose that this makes the story a little more interesting, and not dictated by predisposed ideas of how much of a badass you wanted to be. Like I said before, there is no good or bad.\n\nI never got to get cool looking armour like in the screenshots. Either I wasn't looking hard enough, or it just wasn't there. I mainly stuck with the default armor, because everything else was some kinda weak-♥♥♥ piece of crap.\nIn Summary\nI absolutely reccommend this game. Although I had a few issues in terms of the story, most of it was just my crazy idea of what a story should be like. In fact, this should be a positive thing, because I wanted more of the story. I was just disappointed that I couldn't have a complete story in the game I bought, first try.\n\nI would suggest that you play the game yourself and make your own decisions about the game.","April 23, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Choose between fast paced melee, sluggish crushing melee, ranged attack and magical spells. You make actual choices in the game that changes who your immediate allies are.

(Thus, stealth, traps, and the crossbow are favored on higher diffculties.)\n■ Some of the other reviews on Steam complain about the controls; (I played it with a gamepad and never felt a problem).\n■ Lackluster side characters. (This definately isn't a BioWare game.)\n■ The voice-acting and writing can feel weak time to time. UPDATE: it's particulary bad for a female player character.\n\nAt $30, I'd say the game is decently priced, but for sure snap it up if it drops to $25 or lower.","March 29","true","55.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/243930/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","Short verdict: the game aims for AAA quality, but lacks in every aspect.\n\nStory: The main line is actually quite interesting: in dark times, when the last free elves and humans stand against the approaching hordes of undead warriors lead by powerful mages (Ice Lords), a simple mercenary is possessed by a demon, whose power was diminished by the very same Ice Lords, who drain their power from the very same source the demon does. The mercenary (and the player) has a choice – whether to surrender to the demon and become the most powerful being in the world or to try control the demon and its powers, preserving one's identity.\n\nHowever, in details, the story is far from perfect. There are serious plot holes. Some things happen without any decent explanation. Some events contradict the previous events. The dialogues are cheesy and almost all characters are very rude towards each other.\n\nVoice acting I guess, Spiders had a low budget.\n\nRomance There are potential partners you can romance in this game, if you complete particular sidequests. However, the romance is limited to an achievement you can unlock and the most ridiculous and stupid ''romantic'' cutscenes that are so out of context that I dare to say that this is the worst depiction of romance in all the history of videogames.\n\nMoral choices Again, the same thing. In the end your choices will determine, which of the four alternative endings you'll have and whether you'll preserve your human identity and whether... [well, one of the endings is so EPIC that I don't dare to spoil it for you]. However, before that, there are too many choices that you are offered, which really don't matter, as the consequences are pretty much the same. It's an illusion of choice and lame writing.\n\nCombat Some really great skills and concepts. HOWEVER, the way the combat system is implemented, is just horrible. Camera spinning, attacks that can't be blocked or parried, multiple enemies attacking you at once, knocking you down and not letting you to stand up – it's all there. With patience and right timing for VERY, VERY short windows of opportunity, you can beat this game. But, even on the lowest difficulties, the fights are just too long and tedious and, very often, annoying. The only good thing that makes the fighting less pain in the ♥♥♥, is that crafting is available even during a combat (but which is kind of stupid as a concept, right?) and the weapons don't need repairing. On the bright side and contrary to many other games, your companion actually is useful during the combat and might even save your life in certain challenging situations.\n\nDifficulty and level scaling First, the enemies are a bit too hard, then the enemies are a bit to easy, then the enemies are bit too hard again. And, by hard I mostly mean how very much attention you need to pay to what is happening around, how perfect your timing should be and how long the actual fight takes. But the BOSS BATTLES are a completely different story. They are especially hard, which is fine by me, they should be, because those are the bosses, BUT the final boss is just insanely hard. Unless, you have a large arsenal of bolts, traps and potions and crafting components to craft some more, you are screwed and you can't go back to buy/find some more. My complaint here is that the final fight is insanely hard even on the easiest difficulty. That is not my idea of what "Easy" is (Recruit difficulty) (which game explains as "just the story"). And most other players would agree that the final battle was completely unbalanced compared to the rest of the game.\n\n(See more here)\n\nLevel design. Mazes, mazes, nothing but mazes, multi-level mazes and then some mazes again. I don't know about you guys, but to me it's a bad thing. Especially because the map is static and has almost no functionality what one would expect in a modern game.\n\nGraphics This game was released in 2014, but it looks like something from 2008. Shame, though, 'cause, from the way the environment and characters were designed, I can imagine, that the original concept art was beautiful.\n\nEconomy Except for the final stage, you're always short on money and crafting materials. It's especially painful during the final boss fight.\n\nAs you can see from my and other reviews, there are numerous flaws in Bound by Flame, but, nevertheless, I still enjoyed it more than it annoyed me, so, all in all, I give it a "thumb up". It could've been a hit with more polish.\n\nBut, as it is what it is, I give it: 6/10","May 28","true","20.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Towards the end the game feels a bit rushed and there are places where I almost with certainty can say they skipped a fairly large amount of content they wanted to include. A lot of the story gets bogged down by this feeling of not being finished. That said, the game is a definite gem, full of great ideas and the Spiders should practice practice practice. I can't wait for the next in line.\n\nThe use of music in this game is sublime. Good job guys.\n\nThe old review:\n13 hours into the game I am so deep into the different characters that the discovery of a quest log with a couple of missed quests made me restart the game and do it properly. This should tell you something about the combat system as well: never a dull moment, keeping you on your toes from start to finish of every figh and so extremely responsive that it is a pure pleasure to play and I love having to redo the first hours with my accumulated experience.\n\nWarning for the n00bs and the God of War players: constantly smashing the attack button will only get you killed. Again. And again. And again. On higher difficulties you will cry and beg and squirm and sqeel and whine and punch your screen, as you weaklings should.\nGood news for the skilled RPG players: once you're in the groove, you're paying attention to your enemy and you let yourself flow, the pleasure of violence we all are trained for by the divide-and-conquer corporate media since our first steps in this world, will flood your senses and you will hammer and slice and grind down the hardest oponents with not as much as a scratch on your armor to show for it.\n\nThere could be more options in the build trees and if you choose to go for both heavy and light weaponry on the same character, you may find yourself heavily disadvantaged, since most skills in one tree are replicated with a different style of play in the other tree. And then your flow becomes that much more important and making no mistakes becomes an obsession. Or a frustration - whichever type of personality you are. All of your frustrated people: hahaha.\n\nI have a particular complaint: all of the cut scenes of battle are done with the heavy build. Why? Why are my dual daggers not good enough to be depicted perforating wind pipes and separating vertibrae? I want a dagger-vid dlc.\n\nThe crafting system: just brilliant. It gives you the space to customize your character to best fit your style of play and is non-cumbersome ehough to let you explore ant try out new stuf. Great idea and brilliant implementation.\n\nBefore I go on to talk about the story, I have to say a couple of words about the voice acting and conversations in the game. Voice acting in some of the peripheral characters leaves a bit to be desired, but all the main and important side characters are done with thought, effort and a serious knack for personality. The best part is the attitude and manner of Vulcan, however. You will absolutely adore the self-deprecating insolent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is the main character. He never fails to notice the absurdities in the plot, the clothing and behavior of NPCs and other kliches that RPG games usually just skate over without a second thought. His attitude naturally spills over into the environment and responses of the other characters, making for enjoyable and very believable moments. The most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turn of events seem real to the player, because the environment reacts to the event with a proper dose of "wtf". I don't want to throw any spoilers, but you will know what I am talking about once you dip into the game.\n\nFinally, the story. The story and the tasks given to you are both tightly bound in a neat package, always moving in a well-defined direction, and  flexible enough to make you feel like you are creating your own way of play and character, regardless of what the main story wants you to do. The choices are important here, but what is better is the semi-open world  that allows you to walkt around areas, grind, do side tasks and develop relationships with people around you in the process. It is by no means Skyrim in this respect and it could be much deeper and take much more space, but it will let you get a healthy dose of choice and the ability to postpone the main quest as long as you like.\n\nObviously, I am nowhere near done with the story, since I am exploring every little corner of it and I am about to replay everything I've done so far, but I have a very good feeling about it. Fast pace when it counts, chill when you need, funny as hell and believable. You can't ask for more from a beginning development team.\n\nNow the reviews for this title... I don't understand all the flack this game got. I almost didn't purchase it due to the reviews, but then I saw that these guys did Of Orcs and Men and since that was awesome, I gave the game a chance. I love it. Absolutely love it. The potential this development crew has is sky high.","May 14, 2014","true","46.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Once mastered, combat is smooth in a way that feels similar to a slasher title such as ninja gaiden with an effective parry / dodge system. A friendly note that paying attention to your interrupt stat matters quite a bit.\n\nFor a game created from the groundup by twenty people who designed their own engine, it is an ambitious project which attempts to push beyond some fairly deeply rooted genre trends. There is very little handholding within the game and some quests or even dialogue are easily missed depending on choices made during conversations. Rather than spelling out for a player what is a 'good' or 'bad' response, the fully voiced options allow you to choose based on short bits of what is actually being said.\n\nWhile players should be aware there is a fair bit of swearing within the game, it is in many ways refreshing to see a game buck the trend of 'sterile' dialogue for more colorful language.\n\nWhile there have been many complaints made about both the story and gameplay, I have yet to experience any kind of bug in either combat or general gameplay that has not been related to my own lack of ability. After beating the game on normal difficulty combat now feels so fluid and enjoyable that the idea of a higher difficulty is exciting rather than frustrating. Because the game engine is very responsive to your key inputs, button mashing is a very bad idea while timed blocks and dodges will make even the toughest fights a smooth and flashy victory.\n\nThe overall story of the game is rich and focused, with a presentation much more in the flavor of a cinematic movie rather than a drawn out episodic tv series. Although I would have liked to have had more cinematics or involvment of other villains, the absence of these villans is explained well in context.\n\nAll in all, the game is highly worth it for those prepared to test their abilities and their patience for learning each of the fights as they get progressively harder. For those interested in a shorter but very cinematic storyline, the easiest difficulty may offer less death.\n\nMany nods of the head can be found through the game in homage or appreciation of past RPGs such as Dragon Age and Darksiders to name a couple.\n\nOn the downside, party AI leaves much to be desired although the allies prove to be very useful as distractions. There are a few small animation glitches in cutscenes which are easily overlooked as well.\n\nI am very glad I purchased this game to support a studio that is daring to craft an action RPG like this. The game pushes players out of the kiddie pool and out into the deep waters of hack n slash combat titles.","May 12, 2014","true","62.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The combat definitely takes a while to get used to and can even be cheap at times, especially long range attacks from archers.  That said, it can be rewarding.  I would consider the combat a mix between the Witcher and Demon/Dark Souls series.  While in the Warrior stance, blocking and parrying is definitely your friend.  Using the Ranger stance will make the game easier as your dodge maneuver pretty much dodges anything in the game, and is pretty much required for the final boss which is a pain in the ♥♥♥.  The story is decent at best and some of the dialog is odd albiet hilarious at times.  The supporting cast is also interesting although in combat they really aren't much help except for being aggro so you can attack enemies.  In the end it was definitely an enjoyable game, especially as it wasn't a full priced game.  If you are a fan of games like The Witcher or Demon/Dark Souls I would say give this a shot, especially while on sale.","June 21, 2014","true","26.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

That is really all.\n\nYou want to like this game, but you can't.\n\nThe gameplay is oversimplistic, despite what the trailers will show the only thing you need is to be able to use your block/evade button at the right time and you will never really have to worry about being hurt save for AoEs.\n\nCrafting is always more than a step behind. It's simple -- get what you need and make it from a menu. Is it what you need, though? Not really. For example crafting traps? Can't say it's too useful. Sure, make yourself a minefield and lure things over to it. Done.\n\nBut the biggest axe to grind is the story. When you say that a story has a beginning, a middle and an end? That summarizes the entirety of this game. Of course, trying to be fair here, the premise SOUNDS interesting and certainly has its attraction in that idea. Big undead army that's more or less unstoppable? Sure. Only thing that can stop them is a hero with demonic powers? Okay, I'll pay that. Your choices are always binary, though -- that is, one or the other. Do you take the option which gives the demon within a little more room or do you take the option which retains your humanity. And that's fine.... really, I mean it. But this is the part that makes it outright stupid-- your character's relationship with the demon? Almost non-existent.\n\nBut the biggest part that you learn to hate about this game is that the story itself is just.... incomplete. Incomplete and poorly presented. That guy you saved? He died anyway. How do you find out? Because a text entry said so and one of your companions brings it up briefly. The undead army you're fighting is a big threat? If you say so! Why can't you belive they're actually a bad thing? Well, there's a lack of urgency. In games you need that feeling of urgency -- you need a choice to be difficult to make to make that decision have weight. You won't have that here because there's no real urge that pits things as being impossible for your protagonists to even do. It has so many plotholes most of which make absolutely no sense and lack crucial context. The demon within lacks a strong personality.\n\n\nOverrall, this game gets a big 'NO'. Why? It's incomplete. It's not a game that would be too bad had it cost less than $10 and even then, that would be overselling it. But for $40 you'd expect at least a complete story. I personally am not a person that likes to be too damning when it comes to games but look -- I'll make an exception here because I want the general public to understand that this game is not worth its price tag.","December 21, 2014","false","22.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The gameplay is ok, but it feels like your using a wooden sword on everything and all the other enemies, even just the basic minion little creeps, hit hard. Its like they tried so hard to make this game hard, that its just stupidly difficult, you'll find yourself dieing a lot at certain boss battles.

I keep it installed, coming back to it when I have a couple hours to kill trying to beat that last part I got stuck on. And that's the problem: playing this game is an exercise in willpower. I'm not playing it because I'm having fun. I'm doing it because I just want to get through it.\n\nBound By Flame isn't a terrible game. It's okay. Average. Good enough. If Dark Souls is throwing yourself at a wall and loving the masochistic rush of repeated failure because the final pay-off is just that awesome, this game is kind of like that. Except the pay-off is another ten minutes of 2003 stick-figure animation cutscenes with passable dialogue for a story that really feels like it should be better. Not to mention the slow-moving combat. You'll die numerous times just trying to figure out the timing for a parry, so you'll just start blocking and hitting when the enemies open up. Except there will be four of them and they all attack at a different times leaving you locked forever in the block. And don't expect your allies to help you. They have the durability of a wet tissue and similar attack power.\n\nI love the ideas and characters this story puts forth. Ice Lords slowly destroying the world with the Undead? Awesome! Mercenary that can seamlessly switch between two classes and shoot fireballs? Sweet! Demon-possession that slowly turns you more and more into the corporeal embodiment of a fire spirit? Sign me up! Unfortunately though, everything falls flat and leaves a hollow feeling once you actually see it.\n\nSo in the end, the game is a passable RPG. That's it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyewTV/recommended/243930/","KyewTV","Kyew","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyewTV/","192 products in account","As of this review, I've put roughly 6 hours into Bound By Flame.\nBase Score: 6/10\nSkip to the end if you want a quick summary.\n\nBound By Flame is a good game, but I personally think that it had the potential to be great. That's not to say you shouldn't at least try/ look into the game. It's a fun game with flaws that make it not so fun sometimes.\n\nAs for specifics, the story is a fairly standard "a gigantic evil is approaching and you're the only one that can stop it" plot, but it does have it's fair share of unique twists to seperate it from others. I found myself interested, as the story differentiates itself in ways that I haven't seen before. That's not to say it's some groundbreaking new twist on the fantasy genre, but it didn't particularly remind me of any other game's story too much. The background lore that you can learn of is fairly interesting, but you don't really get to explore any of it. There is a nice variety of quest objectives, so it doesn't feel as if I'm doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nCharacter creation was also something that was rather disappointing, as there were only about 6 hair options and 4 facial options.\n\nThe interactions with your companions are a bit weird and don't really flesh out well. Personally, I felt that it was a less developed version of Dragon Age Origins' companion system.While each companion is vastly different in the way that they talk and act, conversations seem a bit stunted, especially with the less than stellar facial capturing that leads to stiff looking faces. It was pretty annoying that I could only have one companion follow me at a time, but I really only used them for cannon fodder.\n\nThe dialogue choices for the most part capture Vulcan's personality, and can be amusing at times. Despite all of my complaints, I found myself liking Vulcan as a character. The voice acting was average.\n\nYour companions themselves suffer from a case of the cliche. Rhelmar is the elf archer, Edwen is the sexy, dark, mysterious witch, Sybil is the innocent and naive scholar/healer, Randval is the badass warrior who is the last of his tribe, and I haven't met Mathras, so I can't pass judgement on him. Spiders definitely did a good job with determining how they react to situations and dialogue options, meaning that you need to watch what you say and how you say it. Based on your words and actions, you could end up losing followers.\n\nThe combat is... bland. Playing as a ranger, I found myself in a monotonous playstyle pretty quickly: slash slash dodge repeat. Due to the fighting mechanics being a bit clunky, I found enemies far harder than they should have been. The fact that you don't have a grace period when you're knocked down means that you end up losing a good deal of health whenever you find yourself on the ground. All enemy attacks do crazy balls-to-the-wall amounts of damage, so even with upgraded armor and health I find myself dying after 4 or 5 hits. It's not that the game itself is fundamentally hard, the developers just messed up combat leading to an artificial difficulty. For instance, if you dodge while doing a combo, your character will jump right back into the combo, meaning that you step right into the attack that you tried to dodge. That isn't a problem if you time your dodges just right, but I'm stupid like that, so yeah.\n\nGraphically wise, I find the game okay. I don't usually put too much stock into graphics, so it doesn't really matter to me. BBF isn't a graphical masterpiece, but it's not a bad looking game either. Fairly run of the mill, maybe a bit outdated. The details were pretty impressive for a game coming out of a rather unproven studio though. The Witcher influence is pretty in your face, and I feel like there's a bit of Dragon Age too but that could just be me.\n\nWhile I mentioned earlier that the character customization was disappointing, the gear customization is not. There are countless upgrades that all have unique looks and unique traits that you can add. Each piece of armor, unless part of a set, looks different and provides a unique feel to your character. The same applies for weapons, which is a welcome change from games that just rehash weapons with different names for you to use.\n\nI did find myself liking the soundtrack, so there's that.\n\nToo Long; Didn't Read=\n+The main character's pretty cool, and his personality/dialogue choices change as the game progresses.\n+The story, while somewhat cliche, does a good job of investing you and provides enough unique spins to keep it fresh.\n+Nice quest variety\n+The customization/crafting of armor, weapons and upgrades is vast.\n+I like the soundtrack\n+Graphics are pretty good, if a bit outdated.\n-Choices affect Vulcan, the world around him, and your companions, but not by much.\n-Customizing the actual looks of your character is shallow: about 6 hairstyles (can't change the color) and 4 faces\n-Combat is clumsy and annoying. It gives enemies a harder feel than necessary.\n-Voice acting is meh, stiff facial recognition leads to conversations seeming off.\n-Companions are cliche and the "tactical combat" that was a selling point of this game consisted of enemies 3-shotting me and my companions being bad at being cannon fodder.\n\nHonestly, the game looks, feels, and is designed like The Witcher's little brother that tries to emulate him in everything he does but can't.\nAs a final note, I may have ripped on the game for most of my review, but I enjoy it. It's story is nice, but having to plow through the horrible combat is a HUGE turn off. If the combat was a bit smoother, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs with a good story arc. As it stands now, however, it's a game focused on combat that didn't get the combat right (The combat is my main problem with the game. If it were better, I'd be able to overlook everything else and enjoy it for what it is). Buy at your own risk.","May 11, 2014","true","5.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Well, it has some good points: in terms of skill-lvl and feats I think it has a good approach. You lvl skills simply by lvling and getting skill-points, but for feats you need to do something extra (craft, for example). They are pretty easy to get, though: some extra challenge would have been great. Fighting has some potential, but.. It does not seem to have any actual combos and so in the end it becomes quite repetetive. Crafting is... Well, not sure if you can call it that: it's simply upgrading of stuff, which requires specific resources. Graphically it's not bad, but I've seen wayt better, especially in terms of lights and shadows: this one is very bright in some areas. In terms of sound: there are some good music tracks, but voice acting... Let's be honest, it's awful. Actors do not seem to have any passion and for games like this you need it, sot hat players will believe in the story, realte to it. And the story itself... Well, it reminds me of Demon's Forge in someway, but I liked Demon's Forge way more, even though it had its flaws as ewll: it had interesting fighting system, shooting system, humor in the dialouges, good voice acting. Inf act at first I though, that Bound By Flame will be similar, but only some points of the story are (also it's "open-worldish"). Overall, I am amrking this as not recommended, and I give it... 6/10 I guess.","May 9, 2014","false","4.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

Maybe the plot gets better - wouldn't know, as unmemorable characters and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting had me rolling my eyes so far back in my head that I could see my brain melting. Fantasy cliches can still be woven into a decent story, but this has no redeeming qualities. When you're questioning your motivations, along with every NPC lemming that aids you or arbitrarily hates you, it's not generally a good sign.\n\nGenerally, I'm quite forgiving of graphics if a story is good, and can overlook a shallow story if the gameplay and scenery is interesting. On both counts, it's not. This actually reminds me of Kingdoms of Amalur in a way - I haven't a clue what that game was on about in the end, the Magical Kingdom of Whimsyshire while I saved the Rumpledumpins from the Trololodgers. Who knows. But the combat was mindless fun, and I put more hours into it than I thought I might (thought my total on Steam is inflated because I tabbed out of it for several days and forgot it was running, which says a lot about me). While I'm loathe to harp on at the writing continuously, it doesn't even have fun combat to back it up. It feels dated and clumsy, leaving two counts of 'f*ck this ♥♥♥♥' in the Con Column. There are better RPGs out there than this, and better coming up. If you still feel the need to soldier through it, wait for a sale. A bigger sale. The kind of sale that starts '0.xx'.\n\nI, however, have taken to using this game as the second option in 'Would You Rather?' People would rather mate with a ginger or let a Box Jellyfish sit on their face than finish this.\n\n(I honestly think it's one of Dante's levels of Hell, along with slow internet and British Netflix.)","August 30, 2014","false","3.7"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

Because just look at them they are so much alike as far as how they play and to a degree the story.\n\nPros:\n- Visuals are nice.\n- Characters for the most part are well designed and though out.\n- The story is interesting up until the ending.\n- The dialouge and voice acting is for the most part good.\n\nCons:\n- Ending is odd, something of a cop out from making the rest of the game.\n- Doesn't feel like you have much of a choice between embrassing the demon or using him up until the end.\n- Try to feel open world but the enviroments are not large enough to accomplish it.\n- The content snowballs, from spending a decent amount of time in the initial zones, to rushing through the last two zones.\n- Combat can be very frusterating, for all the wrong reasons. Most fights of any notability are just a matter of mashing the right button, doesn't so much feel like you are doging attacks or making a strategic decision.\n- Out of place feeling when the character are using curse words, it just doesn't feel like it fits, to modern for the setting of the game.\n\nOther Thoughs:\n- There are some bugs and oddities in the game. Sometimes the voice actor say one thing, but the subtitles say another.\n- Some character you never feel as though you know or care about.\n\n\nOverall I would recommend the game. Its not going to be the best that you have ever played, but it is decently fun and entertaining.

Not a perfect one, but enjoyable. The combat was fun and difficult at times which was great. There wasn't a ton of variety to the enemies that you fight. And a lot of times the enemies felt like bunching bags because of how much health they had. As far as the story goes there were interesting dialogue moments, while some had no bearing on the plot or the world whatsoever. I did like how some of my choices affected the lives of my companions. The quests weren't bad, but many of them felt unnecessary and resulted in way too much backtracking.

Just as the other two, I greatly enjoyed this one. It might've only lasted for about 13 hours, and there were a few issues and grievances along the way, but all in all this was great fun.\n\nThe story is nothing too original. It's your typical dark fantasy setting with humans facing off the armies of undead, but I was quite impressed with the overall presentation and delivery of it. Most of the companions were quite interesting, though some of them could've been developed a bit better, and the main character and the demon inside of him were very solid in the lead.\n\nThe combat aspect is a bit of a mixed bag. It was incredibly fun in some ways. The moves and abilities made each battle feel epic, especially with the use of superhuman dodge skill, which created some 'wow' moments as you see your character narrowly avoid an enemy swing. However, despite finding it fun, I have to agree with many of the criticisms by other players. The lack of roll command was something I could not understand at all. And the whole interruption mechanic was extremely annoying, because it was easy for enemies to interrupt you mid-swing, not to mention knocking you down on the floor and getting some cheap free hits whilst you're waiting for your character to get back up.\n\nThe difficulty in general was way too high, even for the Easy difficulty setting. For a game that has such a strong focus on story, the Easy mode shouldn't have been this hard. This was made worse by some parts of the game having unpleasant difficulty spikes. In general I thought chapters 1 and 2 were brilliantly done and the flow was perfect. There were many sidequests, and the action bits were balanced out with storytelling.\n\nAnd then chapter 3 came along, and the game was ruined by constant non-stop battles with identical enemies and some horrible level design that forces you to walk through monotonous twisting corridors and too much backtracking. And the final boss was way way way too hard compared to the rest of the game. To make it worse, if you wish to go back and buy more stuff and grind, you can no longer do it, so you have to load an earlier bit of the game. I ended up doing that so that I could buy 40 health potions (and no, that isn't too much).\n\nCombat frustrations aside, the game was still fun and worth playing. The crafting system was done well, and the levelling of skills was reasonably good too. There are 3 mastery trees in total: Warrior, Ranger, and Pyromancer. You can mix and match and invest in any of those as much as you wish. I personally went heavy on the warrior tree. Too bad in the second half of the game I realised that going Ranger stance with daggers was proving to be much better (and seems many other players agree), making Warrior tree quite underpowered compared to the Ranger tree. As for Pyromancy, I found most fire abilities useless, aside from weapon enchantment with fire, which was a single most useful skill in the game.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game, though BE WARNED that it is HARD and unfair, and you will be getting killed a lot even on Easy mode. If that's something you do not mind, then most likely you'll enjoy the game.","March 23, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It definitely tries to emulate Bioware RPG's in a lot of ways, and features action heavy gameplay similar to what one might see in a game like Gothic or Two Worlds. However, some of the enemies have fundamental problems in their design which cause spells not to hit correctly, or melee attacks passing through them without damage. If you're looking for the equivalent of a B Movie in a fantasy game, I'd check out Bound By Flame. It's got all those terrible qualities that you'll grow to love over time, much like Troll 2 or Zombie 3.

If you have any corruption at all, you're stuck with ♥♥♥♥ endings, you need to be all human and do the sacrafice ending to get any kind of recap or anything without a credit scroll. If you ever have corruption key choices are made for you that determine NPC followers. So really there is no freedom and the path is set for the BAD endings as soon as you get any corruption. Also note siding with the demon removes your capability to wear armor pieces, so only choose to if you want to go flatout mage.\n\nCombat= Combat would be fun, until you realize there is only ONE viable build, Ranger with Pyromancer support, or Pyromnacer (demon path) with Ranger support. being a Warrior will just get your ♥♥♥ kicked, you'll be slow and the end game boss, infact several bosses and group fights will rip you apart. There isn't enough damage mitigation in the game to save your ♥♥♥, it's all about mobility and attack speed. So having 3 trees is pointless, it's really only viable with Ranger/Pyromancer unless you are on the EASIEST difficulty, even then it can be a pain.\n\nFIXED= They fixed dialouge issues with NPC's handing out spoilers, read the below review for an examples so that boosts my rating up to 6.7.\n\nPRO's\n*Difficult, in a good sense, I hate games that are too easy, you get bored, this game doesn't dissapoint on any difficulty.\n*Shiny,\n*Good viceral combat, you don't become roll face god mode at any time, you move around and dodge.\n*The story has a great premise and an OK way of delivering it.\n*Replayability for Full human or full demon, honestly you can't save before the end and ge the demon endings, each path has 2 endings, but only the pure human and sacrafice endings have a unique ending tale. Still worth playing twice to see the DEMON mode.\n*Crafting\n\nCONS\n*Buggy visuals, quite often\n*NPC dialouge bugs out often enough, case in point, an NPC wanted to be with me for a certain fight, i took them to that fight, then afterewards the NPC acted like I didn't take them.\n*No quest markers over NPC's you have to revisit everyone multiple times through out chapters.\n*Minor choices have huge resounding consequences, and seemingly huge decisions don't mean squat, save scum often.\n*Lots of foot travel to the same areas for a chain of quests, gets boring.\n\nAdvice* While there are many armor sets throughout the game and you have limited weight capacity here are the ones worth keeping in order. Don't destroy any of the pieces till you have all of the others, these have the most mod capabilies, and the best stats. Everything else is really filler and can be scrapped.\nEARLY GAME:Swordsman\nMIDGAME:Ranger\nLATE GAME:Officer\nENDGAME: Elite Soldier\n\nCombat 9.0/10\nStory 7.0/10\nExeution 4.0/10\n\nEND SCORE 6.7/10\nWorth the currently cheap price, has potential, maybe Spider can improve on it's shortcomings, play for the combat and the shiny\n\n\n*OLD REVIEW BELOW, WAS A THUMBS DOWN*\nAs much as the combat can be fun, that's all it has really going for it.\nThe reason it gets downvotes lets start with the fact that conversations give away quest spoilers or the ending of the game long long before you reach the end of the game. For example *SPOILER INCOMING BUT THE GAME WILL SPOIL IT TOO*  You'll get a hot mage lady she's not entirely trustworthy. In Chapter 2 during  companion conversations you just bring up she used to be an Ice Lord, casualy like you always knew, and she responds in kind, filling you in on all kinds of personal details, skip to about 5 hours later you OFFICIALY find out she was an Ice lord *DUNDUNDUUUUUN* Drama anger can you trust her omfgploxing? Wait wait you spoiled that for me yourself about 5 hours ago. ♥♥♥♥ like this happens ALL THE TIME! You pull information from thin air in conversations and plot decisions from inforamtion you were obvioulsy supposed to have found out, but never actually did.\nYour ability to make choices, is fairly limited, the instances where making a choice seems logical, it gets scripted and you get no choice, like say absorbing the body of a lich, which transforms you, removes your ability to waer helmets and pisses off the elf prince. But you know, getting a choice to allow the demon to stop "mind confusion" seems like ti will mean the death or life of your friends, nope guess what, it doesn't, it means nothing. Seemingly major decisions are infact  cosmetic and the really major decisions are chosen for you with no say what so ever.\nIt's like very very badly written novel by a 9th grade student, or a first time DnD Dungeon Master.\nHonestly wait till this game is like 9.99, it's worth 9.99. I would even say it's worth 14.99 if you really really want it.\n\n5.9/10 a D-\nPRO's\nShiny\nOK but not spectacular combat mechanics\n\nCON's\nBuggy\nInconsistent story progression\nNon sensical decision making\nFalsely advertised freedom. Forced choices in a game that pushes the "your choice matters" advertising\nEarly vs Late game Combat Difficulty Balance is way off","June 30, 2014","true","36.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The opening hours are a little lacking and might put off some players, but once the game enters its stride, provides some cool moments of tactical stealth and action gaming that's worth the price of entry. The story is pretty good, the characterization effective, and the music top quality. The only things letting the game down are some poor visual elements on occasion, unfair design choices which can frustrate or cause cheap deaths, and an overall lack of polish in some areas where things like companion AI gets stuck on the scenery. So, if you like action role playing games then this is worth checking out, although it's not going to be to everyone's tastes. There's some genuinely jarring bits of dialogue from the main character that have to be heard to be believed, but at least there's an abundance of humour here.","May 9, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With RPGs published this month including the beautifully elegant Child of Light and the somewhat comical Stick of Truth, Bound by Flame was refreshingly dark and serious in comparison, lending to it the sense of struggle and desperation that the story strives for. The level of character development and interaction left me wanting to explore all of the dialogue options simply to learn more about the detailed world of Vertiel. Considerable thought went into building up the lore behind the game and it did not go unnoticed.\n\nThe voice acting I found to be a bit inconsistent though. With some characters being splendidly well done, others were seriously comical in how terrible their delivery was. With an extremely limited character creation (male and female models, a couple of cosmetic mods like skin tone, hair, tattoos/scars), a story that was paradoxical at times and personal choices having a minimal impact on where the story goes with itself (it truly does affect how you approach combat late game however!!!), this western RPG loses some of its strongest selling points as an RPG that offers player diverse and customizable experiences. The decisions do radically affect the relationship with your companions, but aside from that, much of the game remains similar.\n\nThe combat was a bit odd in my opinion though, as with my high-end computer, I found a 0.5 second lag between button press and Vulcan's actions. But, by the 3rd hour, I was used to this (unintentional??) timing and combat was truly enjoyable. Thinking ahead and paying attention to the enemies' attack patterns and proper positioning are key, as more often then naught, you will be caught in a brawl within a tight area not allowing much breathing room and every move could bring victory or defeat. Being able to switch freely between Ranger style and Warrior styles on the fly was a neat trick, allowing for multiple approaches on combat, but I found myself mostly sticking to my powerful main weapons such as swords or battle-axes over my knives. I could definitely have used my knives (just getting used to timing the dodge-counterattack-ripost with the aforementioned lag issue), but I just found it quicker to slash with my weapon, interrupt the enemy's action and take victory for myself by counterattacking everything thrown my way with critical strikes. The only instances I used the Knives was to clean up a few trash mobs and quickly deplete a single enemy to zero health. In mobs of varying class (spewers, archers, shield corpses, heavy weapon skeletons), the Warrior's 360 degree parry ability (must be upgraded from simply parrying from the front) truly was a god send as you're being bombarded from all around and the effectiveness of the Ranger's dodge (a jump to directly behind you) was hurt by the tight area of combat that game seems to enjoy throwing you into.\n\nAnd with this, it can be said that all the companions were very useful. On the lower and normal difficulties, the companions you chose can be left to act based on their programmed AI and would actually put up a decent fight. And depending on who you brought, they could make or break the fight by acting as a distraction while you heal or by attacking from afar dealing damage or debuffs or both. However, on the higher difficulties, the companies become noticeably squishier and you must constantly adjust their roles (Autonomous, Survive/Defend, Aggressive Attack, Focus Special) from the tactical menus if you hope for them to survive the skirmish and lend a hand.\n\nThe strongest aspect throughout this entire experience though has to be the crafting system though. While crafting and modifying things on the fly in the middle of combat may seem a tad bit broken, it truly offers innumerable ways to approach a situation. Find yourself being destroyed by a melee juggernaut? recycle or craft the ingredient to upgrade your gear to focus on physical protection. Need to protect against an onslaught of Magic and Poison? do your best to rebalance your gear with what supplies you have on hand.\n\nWith gold being truly hard to come by and merchants selling at exorbitant prices, you must choose between sacrificing gold for basic ingredients to craft immediately for the situation or bide your time to get that awesome piece of gear. All this to say that the crafting was not game breaking, but actually\nanother aspect of the games tactical nature in and outside of combat.\n\nFinally,while the game looks absolutely splendid on the higher settings on PC, sometimes the several bugs I encountered ruined the moment by distorting the placement of character models and messing with the dialogue audio, ruining the mood and the cutscene altogether.\n\nOn multiple instances, I simply reloaded an auto-save to simply rewatch the same cutscene with no bugs present. The fact that I was faced with any bugs altogether seems to be a dose of bad luck, which plays to the games disadvantage because if these bugs are not consistent in their appearance across multiple copies of the game, then no patches will be released in order to address these serious impediments to the flow and progression to the story.\n\nHope you enjoyed this review and I'll see you next time!\n\nGood Game & Have Fun,\nDunban signing out","May 13, 2014","true","33.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But the the large scale bosses make the game great and you can build up your warrior how you see fit and the acting in the game is better then a lot of Action/RPG's i've played.

The main character comes off as a complete ♥♥♥ even if you attempt to play the "nice guy."  (Main character: "Hey look I just killed a giant undead, everyone praise me!" Captain: "Nobody cares, we are trying to survive here. Now shut up a get a move on!") paraphrased but you get the gist.\n\nTo make things even better... the main character tries to have a sense of humor that falls completely short and is horribly timed. Someone just died? Better crack a joke!\n\nThe combat isn't that bad once you get the timing down, though you still have to deal with constant interrupts. Sadly the NPC followers are made of glass... they die almost instantly and are completely worthless. (The AI thinks it's a good idea for a healer/mage to stand in the center of a hoard of undead and try to cast)\n\nThe crafting system is better than most AAA titles released today.

You may (or may not) be familiar with other games developed by Spiders, including Of Orcs and Men and Mars: War Logs, being the most recent of their games.\n\nWhile Bound By Flame may not be the most impressive, or the most original RPG to have ever released, it does offer quite a bit in way of concept, story, and combat. I'll start with the best things Bound By Flame has to offer.\n\n-Visuals\n\nThe visual aspect fo the game is actually quite nice in most cases, with strong dynamic lighting, beautiful level designs, and an immersive world. Aside from a few muddy textures, almost everything in the game looks nice. I personally didn;t notice any clipping, flickering, or major flaws with the graphical aspect of this game.\n\n-Crafting\n\nHaving the ability to craft crossbow bolts, health and mana potions, and even explosive traps and bombs on the fly is a welcome addition to the solid gameplay. Having the ability to also customize your armor and weapons by adding specific stat bonuses is also a nice touch, and helps ensure the feeling of becoming more powerful, because who doesn't love adding spiked shoulder guards and tassets for health and armor bonuses while looking awesome at the same time?\n\n-Gear\n\nThat brings me to my next point. The gear looks fantastic. Swords, axes, and hammers look hefty and deadly, and can be altered through upgrading to look even more powerful and menacing. Armor can also transform the way your character looks (and plays) depending on the stats you want to cultivate. Simply put, the armor and weapons are great for folks who enjoy a bit of customization.\n\n-Combat\n\nI understand some people (you know who you are) are having "trouble" with the combat in this game. While there are a few flaws in the design, it's not often that I actually feel the need to learn efficent strategies for dealing with particular enemy types in games like this. Most games have you facing the same enemies with little variation, and thus little variety in strategy. This is not a game where spamming 1 button will get you through to the end. The combat requires quick reactions, planning, strategy, and swift execution, and can often times be simplified by sneaking and assassinating a hardened target early before facing numerous tough foes.\n\nThe game allows for ranged attacks by way of magic spells or firing a crossbow, as well as swift and deadly attacks with daggers, or slow and heavy blows with a large sword, axe, or hammer. It's important to understand each weapon type and which weapons are the most effective on enemy types. If you wade into a conflict aimlessly swinging your sword around in hopes of mindless slaughter, it will be YOU who gets slaughtered. This is not casual combat for the beginner, and does require skill and timing to maximize your own effectiveness.\n\n-Music/Sound\n\nThe music and sound of the game are pretty impressive, all things considered, and I found myself immersed in the hauntingly beautiful melodies that gently flow while I explore a frozen wasteland or a dark cave. The music is a VERY strong point for this game.\n\nNow lets talk about the flaws with the game.\n\n-Dialogue/Lip Sync\n\nMost of the dialogue is engaging, and decent enough, but there are times when the voice acting is sub-par, and many times when the spoken dialogue does not match up well with the movements of a character's mouth. If you are a fan of localized JRPGS, this won't bother you very much. If, however, you are accustomed to spot on voice performances and mouth syncing, you may be a little unnerved by the flaws.\n\nThere is also character dialogue that seems to be done by unprofessionals, "Sybil and Buffalo" and while there aren't many characters who sound aloof and terrible, those two are essentially the only ones that got under my skin. Even with the needless cursing at times, most of the other dialogue and characters seemed spot on.\n\n-Hitboxes (Combat)\n\nWhile the combat can be fun (or frustrating), there is a noticeable difference between visual representations of enemies and their actual "hit boxes" as in the actual "reach" of an enemy may be farther or closer than their actual attack seems to hit. This is a minor flaw at worst, considering that after your first few fights, you will grow accustomed to the distance necessary when combating certain enemies. The "lack of dodge rolling" is even less of a flaw considering that each weapon set (Daggers/Sword) uses a different system for defense. Using a sword grants the ability to parry almost any attack, and if timed properly allows for a devastating counter attack that can send an enemy reeling, allowing for follow up attacks.\n\nUsing daggers allows for a backward leap, essentially dodging all incoming damage and if timed properly also results in a devastating counter attack and follow up. There is also a skill in the Ranger tree that once unlocked allows you to sprint during combat, making quick break-aways easier. A good strategy to distance yourself from a pack of powerful enemies is to lay an explosive trap in their oncoming path, then sprint away, breaking line of sight and returning to a stealth stance. This allows for area damage, knocking the enemies back, and allowing you the oppurtunity to instantly kill or seriously injure an unsuspecting enemy from stealth.\n\nSo while the hitboxes may not always be indicative of the actual hit range of an enemy, there are plenty of counter measures to level the playing field and ensure you aren't falling victim to "phantom swipes".\n\n\n\nThis game is by no means comparable to other triple A titles of the same genre, but if you are looking for an enjoyable, action based RPG, this is a good choice. While it doesn't stray far from the genre basics, most of what the game does, it does quite well. This game was developed with a fraction of the budget that most other games of this calibur are allowed, and the level quality is quite surprising, coming from a small studio like Spiders.\n\nI do not regret giving this game a chance, and would recommend it to any hardcore RPG enthusiast, but this game is not for the casual gamer. This isn't a Dark Souls game by any means, but if you aren't familiar with concepts like strategy, planning, and adaptation, you will come away from this experience sorely dissapointed due to repeated failure.\n\n","May 9, 2014","true","21.4"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Bound by Flame is easily one of the smartest purchases I've made in a long time. The price would be fair at $60 but for $33 it was a steal. I actually feel guilty. I would recommend this game to fans of Dragon Age; Dark Souls; The Witcher; Dragon's Dogma, not because it is similar but because the strengths of those games are represented here. Anyone who appreciated those games should appreciate this one but make no mistake.. Bound by Flame is it's own game. It clearly deserves to stand on it's own merit as an excellent acheivement for the developer and an incredible experience for the fans.\n\nThe game looks amazing, the combat is challenging but feels incredible and is wonderfully rewarding when done correctly. The dodge and parry mechanics when timed right are extremely gratifying. At higher difficulties it is essential to learn the mechanics and timing and use all the tools provided in combat. The environments aren't completely open but rather blocks of area's with various paths similar to dragon age 2. There are many quests to complete at each stage before moving on to the next and the story quests definitely feel like they affect your path. Anyone who would rather avoid all story will still get something out of this game although I feel they are doing themselves a disservice. It's not often that I make a point in games to read every last conversation option with every character I come across but I find the story is held back enough to keep me interested in discovering the mystery from all these unadvertised points of view and insights from characters all over the world. The voice acting is done well enough not to break the immersion and voices and accents vary enough to keep it interesting. I can safely say I will playthrough this game again as soon as this play is complete to discover the other branches of the options and choices I made. There is enough of a crafting system to feel like it's making a difference with plenty of gear and options to suit any playstyle. The 3 character skill trees are warrior (sword), ranger (daggers) and magic which works in tandem the others along with a passive bonus portion with separate points. You switch on the fly between sword and dagger styles, but magic is always available and used for enchanting your current weapon, used defensively or for ranged attacks. The sword is more blocking and parrying while the daggers are faster and involve dodging. Neither is better, both feel good and have strengths for certain enemies and conditions. There is an exploration and collection element as many items can be found and most of which can be upgraded using the different items found around the world in hidden chests and as drops. There are also companions that you meet and unlock over your journey that can be selected to accompany you on your quests from the local hub. The full compliment is there (if you don't have them killed when you meet them) bow ranged, magic ranged, magic healer, tank, etc. All with different and unique personalities and opinions and they all have multiple conversation options. For me the combat feels alot like the DS series but easier in the sense that there is no endurance so blocking and parrying are required to win but cost nothing and can be used often. Although a mistake can be just as costly especially with multiple enemies; missing a parry can open you up to a chain of attacks that finish you. Each enemy is difficult until attack patterns are learned and you can judge how and when to block, parry and dodge the different attacks. Potions for health and magic as well as traps and crossbow bolts can be crafted on the fly with items found and dropped and all remain useful well in to the game.\n\nI cannot attest to the length of the game but it is rare that I am afraid of getting to the end. I'm having that much fun with it.   As for the budget and the studio's experience... I don't care. Don't insult yourself by considering any of that ♥♥♥♥. This is a solid game I would be happy to have paid much more to play and I'm somewhat upset that I didn't. These are the people that deserve my money so they can fund their next incredible project, not just pay for the costs of this one. It may not be your favorite game of the year but anyone who gives it a real shot will have to admit it's definitely of a higher quality and substance than most RPG's released with this little marketing and at such a low price point and is a positive adition to any collection.","May 9, 2014","true","25.7"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","1"

For me I kind of prefered Mars War logs which was the previous game made by the same company using the same ideas. The game is played out a bit like Witcher 2 though this is much smaller and less depth....but the crafting system isnt bad except for the re-used armor designs where some early armor looks the same as a high-tier armor later on (there isnt alot of armor sets in the game) However there are alot of weapons and each one is named so they sound and look very unique. One problem I have with the game is how boring combat can be later on in the game where the larger enemies spam area of effect attacks which you have to dodge which at "one stab and dodge/parry at a time" can make it feel boring so I had to turn down the difficulty to get though it faster. In attidion enemies can sometimes "stack up" in one spot and all attack you which makes it a real pain because its hard to get one hit off without reciving 3 hits back...and trying to spread them out isnt going to help D:  On and I forgot to mention the undead with 2 shield.....oh god these are so anoying if you dont put points into "critical knockdown" kick attack as they are invincivle and have too much health unless you like doing that "one stab and dodge/parry at a time" trick or get lucky after 50 or so hits when the shield breaks....seriously its anoying to see these guy and worse if you see them hanging around some other big guys (tip: just run past them solves everything). Anyway I still enjoyed this game but I havnt yet played with the diffrent story-changing choices you have to make mid-game. I recommend getting it a little cheaper later on though.","May 18, 2014","true","14.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

So don't expect it to be anything like Skyrim, Witcher, Dragon Age, or Dark Souls. However, developers did really good job with what they had. Honestly, I expected something far worse when I started this game, but I ended up pleasantly surprised.\nPros:\n- Interesting story. Though I think they should've added more lore and details. Also I have a feeling that the game does not take itself serious at all, and developers did that on purposed. Overall, despite the "dark, serious" outline, BBF feel more like a comedy action drama than a dark gritty fantasy.\n- likable characters. Pretty much all characters, including Vulcan, the protagonist that you control, feel lighthearted, and funny despite being in such a chaostic world.\n- Decent graphic. Again, can't compare to AAA games we have today, but still pretty pleasant to look at.\n- Great music.\n- Simple, yet robust crafting system\n- Choices with consequences. (not as deep as Witcher or Dragon Age though)\n- Tough, challenging combat.\n\nCons:\n- Limited character customization.\n- Average voice acting.\n- Stiff, and somewhat clunky animation.\n- Followers' AI need some serious improvement. They are still useful, but not as much as they should be.\n- "corridors" maps make the fantasy world feel somewhat small and underwhelming.\n- Rather short. Around 15 hours with most sidequests completed.\n\nOverall though, I give this a 7/10. A good game. Keep an open mind, accept it for what it is instead of comapring it with other big budget games, and you might be surprise.","May 8, 2014","true","50.2"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

The animations on talking in general are pretty bad as well, I don't mean just lip syncing, I mean it in general looks like trying to do facial animations from something barely more powerful then a N64.\n\nWith that said the rest of the animations for combat are good, combat feels good with decent mechanics, and while the story its self doesn't seem memorable as of yet it does seem interesting enough to care about it. And while some of the difficulty of the game is removed by the fact that the game pretty much auto saves just prior to you entering combat prior to every fight so that if you die in combat all you lose is going back a few seconds prior to engauging the enemy allowing you to restratigies how you take on the enemy with no real lose and so there is no worry about wither or not you will fail the combat on your first try since all you will lose if you fail is about 2 seconds (quit literitally) of progress and that is it. But also with that said the combat does feel challenging enough to where at some points you are glade it auto saved right before you entered combat because you can and will die a few times trying to master the timing of dodging and parrying and riposting and stance switching to be able to win the combat, at no point does the game hold your hand and let you "tank" hits, some simple mobs can kill you in 2-3 hits with ease.\n\nAs to wither or not if choices in the game that are suppose to have conciquences are big enough to warrent replaying I obviously can not judge yet since this is mearly a first impressions and I have not completed and restarted the game yet. But all in all the game seems worth picking up despite bad VA and aweful talking animations.\n\nMy current impression is that while this game is not and will not be a "Must Have" title, this game will be a "that was well worth the price point, I feel satisfied with my purchase, definitly not a game of the year material, but definitly fun regaurdless" title. So would I recommend picking up this game? Yes, again if I get 1/2 way in and it takes a nose dive to the point of changing my opinion I will update this, but as for now I would say it seems well worth a purchase.\n","May 8, 2014","true","8.2"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","1"

You don't directly control your companion in battle, but you do have the option of setting their behavior (offensive, defensive, healer, etc.), and they are responsive to your commands, even in mid-battle. The graphics are decent, so it won't necessarily blow you away with its visuals, but it's definitely got a lot going for it visually.\n\nThe complaints about the poor lip-syncing are accurate, but I have to say the voice acting is generally spot on! And any fans of the genre know this is not always the case with this kind of title. I also think the writing is generally well done, and the story, while not wholly original, is quite solid and interesting.\n\nYes, the character creation options are very limited in terms of customizing your physical appearance (only five faces per gender? Really?), but I have heard that there is a robust crafting system that will at least help you to further customize your appearance through the armor and weapons you forge.\n\nI also must say the game runs very smoothly so far. No lag, even with a number of enemies on screen in full-blown combat. And I haven't run into any bugs, but I am still quiet early in the game.\n\nI would definitely recommend this title for fans of the genre.

I enjoy the challenge of doing blind playthroughs of games on the hardest difficulty and seeing how well I can learn and adapt to steep odds. While this game is hard, there are a lot of things in there that just seem to be a result of lazy programming. The problems are:\n\nNo control over combos. Want to do that one move that stuns your enemy or a quick blow in between your enemie's attacks? TOO BAD the fighting in this game boils down to who can flail the hardest as you have no control over which attacks you do. There are really no combos other than Left click, left click, left click x 1 billion and they all do random ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes you will do a heavy swipe that will stun your opponent, sometimes the very  same heavy strike will not stun the SAME EXACT opponent. Sometimes left click will have your character do a forward lunge and sometimes it wont. ♥♥♥♥ just happens when you click LMB. The only logic that I could get from the combos is that it might be affected by the distance between your character and the target you want to hit at the moment you press left click and thats pretty much it.\n\nEnemies that do a ♥♥♥♥ ton of damage while you do very little damage. This is a a horrible part of the game since oftentimes you will be fighting against mobs of enemies and when every enemy you fight is a tank that hits you like a truck, combat isnt fun, its a chore because 1 or 2 mistakes will mean you're dead and have to redo almost 10 minutes of gameplay.\n\nBeing stuck in an infinite stun lock against groups of enemies is a thing and completely ruins the combat. There's this one part pretty early in the game where you have to train new recruits how to fight and they BEAT THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF YOU because they all knew how to coordinate their attacks so you'd never be able to retaliate unless you wanted to get hit once and die.\n\nThe counter system is buggy and useless against getting stunlocked by groups of enemies. A big part of Bound by flames combat is to perfectly block an attack leading to a counter. Since your character pretty much has no attacks that can stun his opponent leading to actual combos, this is pretty important since the only way to do damage is to contantly press LMB until you see the monster rear back for his attack animation and then hit you. However, sometimes, even if you react perfectly you will still take the damage even if your block comes out right.\n\nTLDR: Buggy combat, enemies op and you are underpowered, a guy kicked me out of my block and proceeded to keep kicking me while I was down so I couldnt recover until I died.","December 22, 2014","false","16.9"," 36 of 72 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","36","72","5","0"

But trust me, it's enough time to review it.\nI'll break this down in a really simplistic way.\n\nPros:\n- You can pointlessly name your character so everyone can call you a 'nickname' you didn't choose.\n- Customisable character.\n- You can have a beard.\n- The "Man Bun" is in fashion right now in Britain so that's a plus.\n- Character models are in 3D.\n- There is audio.\n- At least some small degree of effort has been made to produce this game.\n- When I bought this game it was ♥♥♥♥ing cheap as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are poor.\n- The voice acting is about as stale as a fart trapped in a 30 year old couch. Plus the amount of swearing/cursing so far is beyond contrived and forced. It's like they wanted to be edgey and cool. Instead they should have concentrated on making the overall dialogue more believable. Ironclad warriors speaking like 1990s gangbangers in crime thriller movie. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing bad.\n- The combat controls and feels like something from the PS1. Well, no, that's not fair on the Playstation. It suffered from hardware limitations of the time, Bound by Flame doesn't. It suffers from the poor choices of it's developers, cutting corners and doing nothing new.\n- The skill tree is boring and mundane. Pointless small increases in percentages that are not even noticable.\n- Cliché after cliché. I feel like I've played this game 20 times already it's that predictable.\nThe story that I've trudged through thus far is about as original as a salted peanut.\nThe character design is boring, recylced and done to death. Red haired, bearded, vulgar mercenaries with poorly attempted Scottish accents. Maybe you Americans don't care about authenticity in your accents, but I certainly do.\n\n\nI honestly don't know what else I can say about Bound By Flame other than it's awful.

None of the questions you've racked up over the course of the game are answered to any degree whatsoever.\nIf I didn't know any better, I'd say this game was made in some European language, got translated to Japanese first, then to English, because there seem to be huge gaps in the plot.\n\nEntire swaths of(still subtitled) dialogue are cut, and it is obvious.\n\nI can't recommend this game in good conscience, and that saddens me deeply.

So don't expect it to be anything like Skyrim, Witcher, Dragon Age, or Dark Souls. However, developers did really good job with what they had. Honestly, I expected something far worse when I started this game, but I ended up pleasantly surprised.\nPros:\n- Interesting story. Though I think they should've added more lore and details. Also I have a feeling that the game does not take itself serious at all, and developers did that on purposed. Overall, despite the "dark, serious" outline, BBF feel more like a comedy action drama than a dark gritty fantasy.\n- likable characters. Pretty much all characters, including Vulcan, the protagonist that you control, feel lighthearted, and funny despite being in such a chaostic world.\n- Decent graphic. Again, can't compare to AAA games we have today, but still pretty pleasant to look at.\n- Great music.\n- Simple, yet robust crafting system\n- Choices with consequences. (not as deep as Witcher or Dragon Age though)\n- Tough, challenging combat.\n\nCons:\n- Limited character customization.\n- Average voice acting.\n- Stiff, and somewhat clunky animation.\n- Followers' AI need some serious improvement. They are still useful, but not as much as they should be.\n- "corridors" maps make the fantasy world feel somewhat small and underwhelming.\n- Rather short. Around 15 hours with most sidequests completed.\n\nOverall though, I give this a 7/10. A good game. Keep an open mind, accept it for what it is instead of comapring it with other big budget games, and you might be surprise.","May 8, 2014","true","50.2"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

The animations on talking in general are pretty bad as well, I don't mean just lip syncing, I mean it in general looks like trying to do facial animations from something barely more powerful then a N64.\n\nWith that said the rest of the animations for combat are good, combat feels good with decent mechanics, and while the story its self doesn't seem memorable as of yet it does seem interesting enough to care about it. And while some of the difficulty of the game is removed by the fact that the game pretty much auto saves just prior to you entering combat prior to every fight so that if you die in combat all you lose is going back a few seconds prior to engauging the enemy allowing you to restratigies how you take on the enemy with no real lose and so there is no worry about wither or not you will fail the combat on your first try since all you will lose if you fail is about 2 seconds (quit literitally) of progress and that is it. But also with that said the combat does feel challenging enough to where at some points you are glade it auto saved right before you entered combat because you can and will die a few times trying to master the timing of dodging and parrying and riposting and stance switching to be able to win the combat, at no point does the game hold your hand and let you "tank" hits, some simple mobs can kill you in 2-3 hits with ease.\n\nAs to wither or not if choices in the game that are suppose to have conciquences are big enough to warrent replaying I obviously can not judge yet since this is mearly a first impressions and I have not completed and restarted the game yet. But all in all the game seems worth picking up despite bad VA and aweful talking animations.\n\nMy current impression is that while this game is not and will not be a "Must Have" title, this game will be a "that was well worth the price point, I feel satisfied with my purchase, definitly not a game of the year material, but definitly fun regaurdless" title. So would I recommend picking up this game? Yes, again if I get 1/2 way in and it takes a nose dive to the point of changing my opinion I will update this, but as for now I would say it seems well worth a purchase.\n","May 8, 2014","true","8.2"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","1"

You don't directly control your companion in battle, but you do have the option of setting their behavior (offensive, defensive, healer, etc.), and they are responsive to your commands, even in mid-battle. The graphics are decent, so it won't necessarily blow you away with its visuals, but it's definitely got a lot going for it visually.\n\nThe complaints about the poor lip-syncing are accurate, but I have to say the voice acting is generally spot on! And any fans of the genre know this is not always the case with this kind of title. I also think the writing is generally well done, and the story, while not wholly original, is quite solid and interesting.\n\nYes, the character creation options are very limited in terms of customizing your physical appearance (only five faces per gender? Really?), but I have heard that there is a robust crafting system that will at least help you to further customize your appearance through the armor and weapons you forge.\n\nI also must say the game runs very smoothly so far. No lag, even with a number of enemies on screen in full-blown combat. And I haven't run into any bugs, but I am still quiet early in the game.\n\nI would definitely recommend this title for fans of the genre. I 'll update this review if my opinion changes as I get more gametime under my belt.","May 8, 2014","true","3.4"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

If you have any corruption at all, you're stuck with ♥♥♥♥ endings, you need to be all human and do the sacrafice ending to get any kind of recap or anything without a credit scroll. If you ever have corruption key choices are made for you that determine NPC followers. So really there is no freedom and the path is set for the BAD endings as soon as you get any corruption. Also note siding with the demon removes your capability to wear armor pieces, so only choose to if you want to go flatout mage.\n\nCombat= Combat would be fun, until you realize there is only ONE viable build, Ranger with Pyromancer support, or Pyromnacer (demon path) with Ranger support. being a Warrior will just get your ♥♥♥ kicked, you'll be slow and the end game boss, infact several bosses and group fights will rip you apart. There isn't enough damage mitigation in the game to save your ♥♥♥, it's all about mobility and attack speed. So having 3 trees is pointless, it's really only viable with Ranger/Pyromancer unless you are on the EASIEST difficulty, even then it can be a pain.\n\nFIXED= They fixed dialouge issues with NPC's handing out spoilers, read the below review for an examples so that boosts my rating up to 6.7.\n\nPRO's\n*Difficult, in a good sense, I hate games that are too easy, you get bored, this game doesn't dissapoint on any difficulty.\n*Shiny,\n*Good viceral combat, you don't become roll face god mode at any time, you move around and dodge.\n*The story has a great premise and an OK way of delivering it.\n*Replayability for Full human or full demon, honestly you can't save before the end and ge the demon endings, each path has 2 endings, but only the pure human and sacrafice endings have a unique ending tale. Still worth playing twice to see the DEMON mode.\n*Crafting\n\nCONS\n*Buggy visuals, quite often\n*NPC dialouge bugs out often enough, case in point, an NPC wanted to be with me for a certain fight, i took them to that fight, then afterewards the NPC acted like I didn't take them.\n*No quest markers over NPC's you have to revisit everyone multiple times through out chapters.\n*Minor choices have huge resounding consequences, and seemingly huge decisions don't mean squat, save scum often.\n*Lots of foot travel to the same areas for a chain of quests, gets boring.\n\nAdvice* While there are many armor sets throughout the game and you have limited weight capacity here are the ones worth keeping in order. Don't destroy any of the pieces till you have all of the others, these have the most mod capabilies, and the best stats. Everything else is really filler and can be scrapped.\nEARLY GAME:Swordsman\nMIDGAME:Ranger\nLATE GAME:Officer\nENDGAME: Elite Soldier\n\nCombat 9.0/10\nStory 7.0/10\nExeution 4.0/10\n\nEND SCORE 6.7/10\nWorth the currently cheap price, has potential, maybe Spider can improve on it's shortcomings, play for the combat and the shiny\n\n\n*OLD REVIEW BELOW, WAS A THUMBS DOWN*\nAs much as the combat can be fun, that's all it has really going for it.\nThe reason it gets downvotes lets start with the fact that conversations give away quest spoilers or the ending of the game long long before you reach the end of the game. For example *SPOILER INCOMING BUT THE GAME WILL SPOIL IT TOO*  You'll get a hot mage lady she's not entirely trustworthy. In Chapter 2 during  companion conversations you just bring up she used to be an Ice Lord, casualy like you always knew, and she responds in kind, filling you in on all kinds of personal details, skip to about 5 hours later you OFFICIALY find out she was an Ice lord *DUNDUNDUUUUUN* Drama anger can you trust her omfgploxing? Wait wait you spoiled that for me yourself about 5 hours ago. ♥♥♥♥ like this happens ALL THE TIME! You pull information from thin air in conversations and plot decisions from inforamtion you were obvioulsy supposed to have found out, but never actually did.\nYour ability to make choices, is fairly limited, the instances where making a choice seems logical, it gets scripted and you get no choice, like say absorbing the body of a lich, which transforms you, removes your ability to waer helmets and pisses off the elf prince. But you know, getting a choice to allow the demon to stop "mind confusion" seems like ti will mean the death or life of your friends, nope guess what, it doesn't, it means nothing. Seemingly major decisions are infact  cosmetic and the really major decisions are chosen for you with no say what so ever.\nIt's like very very badly written novel by a 9th grade student, or a first time DnD Dungeon Master.\nHonestly wait till this game is like 9.99, it's worth 9.99. I would even say it's worth 14.99 if you really really want it.\n\n5.9/10 a D-\nPRO's\nShiny\nOK but not spectacular combat mechanics\n\nCON's\nBuggy\nInconsistent story progression\nNon sensical decision making\nFalsely advertised freedom. Forced choices in a game that pushes the "your choice matters" advertising\nEarly vs Late game Combat Difficulty Balance is way off","June 30, 2014","true","36.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Not a perfect one, but enjoyable. The combat was fun and difficult at times which was great. There wasn't a ton of variety to the enemies that you fight. And a lot of times the enemies felt like bunching bags because of how much health they had. As far as the story goes there were interesting dialogue moments, while some had no bearing on the plot or the world whatsoever. I did like how some of my choices affected the lives of my companions. The quests weren't bad, but many of them felt unnecessary and resulted in way too much backtracking.

I enjoy the challenge of doing blind playthroughs of games on the hardest difficulty and seeing how well I can learn and adapt to steep odds. While this game is hard, there are a lot of things in there that just seem to be a result of lazy programming. The problems are:\n\nNo control over combos. Want to do that one move that stuns your enemy or a quick blow in between your enemie's attacks? TOO BAD the fighting in this game boils down to who can flail the hardest as you have no control over which attacks you do. There are really no combos other than Left click, left click, left click x 1 billion and they all do random ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes you will do a heavy swipe that will stun your opponent, sometimes the very  same heavy strike will not stun the SAME EXACT opponent. Sometimes left click will have your character do a forward lunge and sometimes it wont. ♥♥♥♥ just happens when you click LMB. The only logic that I could get from the combos is that it might be affected by the distance between your character and the target you want to hit at the moment you press left click and thats pretty much it.\n\nEnemies that do a ♥♥♥♥ ton of damage while you do very little damage. This is a a horrible part of the game since oftentimes you will be fighting against mobs of enemies and when every enemy you fight is a tank that hits you like a truck, combat isnt fun, its a chore because 1 or 2 mistakes will mean you're dead and have to redo almost 10 minutes of gameplay.\n\nBeing stuck in an infinite stun lock against groups of enemies is a thing and completely ruins the combat. There's this one part pretty early in the game where you have to train new recruits how to fight and they BEAT THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF YOU because they all knew how to coordinate their attacks so you'd never be able to retaliate unless you wanted to get hit once and die.\n\nThe counter system is buggy and useless against getting stunlocked by groups of enemies. A big part of Bound by flames combat is to perfectly block an attack leading to a counter. Since your character pretty much has no attacks that can stun his opponent leading to actual combos, this is pretty important since the only way to do damage is to contantly press LMB until you see the monster rear back for his attack animation and then hit you. However, sometimes, even if you react perfectly you will still take the damage even if your block comes out right.\n\nTLDR: Buggy combat, enemies op and you are underpowered, a guy kicked me out of my block and proceeded to keep kicking me while I was down so I couldnt recover until I died.","December 22, 2014","false","16.9"," 36 of 72 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","36","72","5","0"

At the time of my purchase it was $5.\n\nIf you're looking for an incredible story to sink your teeth in for several hours, this may not be the game for you. Although it dabbles in something interesting concepts and provides player choices to alter the outcome of the game, the entire lore is a bit lackluster. The characters involved that attempt to drive the lore are also themselves bland and lacking true character development. Your potential followers hardly possess any characteristics that make them stand out from the rest of the npcs, and so it's hard to feel any real attachment to them. There are romance options in the game, but they feel rushed and simply misplaced in the context of the game.\n\nThe game's saving grace is the combat. It is heavily reliant on parry/dodge/block mechanics, but that saves it from being a boring hack and slash game with no good story to fall on. Apart from most rpgs, if you take a hit you will take a lot of damage, but it's not much of a contestant to the likes of the soul series. The animations are fluid and feel as if the sword your swinging has some real weight to it.\n\nThe talent trees have little to offer as there is not many skills to choose from. The crafting is simple, yet effective. Most weapons and armors have modifications which actually give different appearances along with different effects.\n\nAs for the main attraction of the game, becoming demon or remaining human adds a fun factor to the game and gives it a bit of replayability.\n\nOverall, it is something to play when you have some time to kill and want a bit of a combat challenge.","May 5","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On a good sale however this is a great game with a good amount of depth.  The branching gameplay has some meaningful decisions, and some illusory choice, but that is to be expected with this type of game.  Essentially this is really impressive, considering the size of the development team.  I enjoyed this game and found the playthrough engrossing enough to keep going even when some of the segments got a bit repetitive.  I don't know if it's possible to beat the game with Warrior build, but the rogue and pyromancer skill tree are a deadly combo.  Worth the time I put into it.","May 16","true","18.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It seems as though they had big plans for the story but were rushed near the end, since the story becomes rushed and some lines appear to be delivered assuming the player had prior knowledge of something that was not stated. Combat is nice, though unbalanced since it seems between the choice of 2-handed weapons and dual daggers they do the same damage per hit, but daggers hit much more often than 2-handed weapons. I managed to beat the game going pure 2-handed, but near the end I wished I had gone the dagger route.\n\nOverall I recommend due to uniqueness (Spiders seem good at making unique games despite what I percieve to be budget problems) and vision despite not quite reaching what I think could have been an epic game.","April 9","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Pro's and Con's will be listed last.\n\nSo far I'm really enjoying the game.  The combat is super fun.  It does require you to learn how to use certain skills to your advantage which prevents you from just being able to be button mash king.  You do mash on the attach alot, but there is skill behind when to attack.  Very similar to Dark Souls but much more fast paced.\n\nThe game starts out with some wonderful cut scenes that are enjoyable to watch.  The graphics in the game aren't anything special but they are NOT an eye sore.  I personally enjoy that middle ground and like the way this game looks.  The control of your character is very fluid and feels natural.  Combat took me a bit to adjust to since i'm use to playing dark souls.  I find myself mashing away at the triggers when i need to mash my buttons.  Nothing against the game here, just want to point it out.  The game gives you a fairly good introduction in how to operate in the game.  It removes the 'have to read the manual' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The first boss you come across is challenging similarly to dark souls bosses.  Lots of little annoyances running around preventing you from doing the end goal.  I have found the story to be lacking so far.  The dialogueis really bad too, not really well lip sync'd\n\nPro's\nLooks Good\nControls feel natural\nGood Starting Tutorial section\n\nCon's\nStory\nLip Sync\nVoice acting\ndialogue\n\nOver all i think this is going to be a fun game with some qwerks about it that will probably be funny throughout the playthough.","May 8, 2014","true","13.8"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The voice acting reminds me of postal 2 which may not be a good thing considering the calibur of the game.  The graphics are pretty amazing, minus the mouth movement when people talk.  So far I'm enjoying it.  Be careful with point allocation - haven't found a way to respec if there is one.  You can get followers, but really the only one worth it is Sybil which can heal.  I'll be honest.  I can recommend it because I like the story, graphics and creature design, but it's definintely not for everybody.  If bound by flame and kingdoms of amalur would make a love child it would be the perfect game as it can take the best parts of both of these games.  Just a small suggestion to make the game much better - allow two companions to follow you. 1 is not enough and only having one means you're only going to have the healer as its the default go to choice.\n\n**added info**\nOkay so I put more time into the game.  As I started getting more money I was able to better craft my gear and even make potions which are not readily available early in the game.  I've been switching out followers and experimenting.  While Sybil is a good healer and offensive mage, others seem to be quite nice as well, again, as long as you can keep up the healing.  The story is getting more interesting and its very dark and has a nice gothic touch.  I'll continue to update as I go along.\n\n**edit**\nOk so I beat the game awhile back and it was very fun.  As I started to learn the mechanics other companions started to seem more beneficial.  The game is great and I'm currently going for a 2nd go.","May 8, 2014","true","19.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The combat was decent, you need to position yourself properly and time your dodges/blocks. I originally started on the normal difficulty and it was too difficult for me to dodge/parry 3-4 different mobs at the same time while trying to whittle down their hp, so I turned it down to easy. On easy, it was still a challenge, but a minor one. The primary issue I have with the combat is that going pyromancer doesn't seem viable until you get to late game. You will not have enough mana to kill all the mobs with spells for most of the game and you won't have the resources to keep getting mana pots. Leveling also doesn't seem to make you that much stronger. I seem to be fighting the same enemies from level 1-25, however the killing speed did not really increase by much.\n\nThe story was ok. Some SPOILERS ahead, so read at your own risk. You only kill one of the 7 ice lords. You never even get to see the other ice lords. Also the final scene after you make your choice on what to do with the world, was extremely disappointing. You get to choose to either destroy the world or rule it. I chose to burn it with fire and destroy it, but all that happened was I absorbed the power of the world heart and then the credits. I wanted to at least see parts of the world burn or something.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game was the final boss fight. Relative to all the fights before it, it was insanely difficult. I had no trouble beating the last few bosses with my daggers and dodging successfully most of the time. During the final fight, I had to switch to my crossbow and whittle the boss down from afar. You also do not have the option of leaving the area, so if you didnt have like 100+ crossbow bolts on hand or the materials to craft them you were basically screwed. Looking around on the internet, this seems to be a common problem. I was playing on Easy and his attacks did massive damage, while my fully upgraded flaming daggers barely scratched him. Add to this that his glowing daggers and the graphical effects sort of blur his dagger movements, it was very difficult for me to tell when he was going to attack. I tried about 3 times to kill him with my daggers before I gave up and just used my crossbow. Luckily I had a huge stockpile of materials to make 200 or so crossbow bolts and about 20 hp potions. I do not understand why their is such a disparity in the difficulty between this boss and all the others. I can understand if this occurred on the hardest difficulty or something, because beating him with melee on easy probably requires you to have the skills to be able to beat the game on hard. Therefore forcing a less competent player like me to use cheap ranged tactics.\n\nOverall the game is not terrible, but I definitely would not recommend it. The gameplay was decent but a little difficult for the average gamer. The story was decent, but I was left very unsatisfied. The last boss fight was horribly designed and there is a good chance it will cause you to ragequit.\n\nOne particularly annoying issue that I forgot to mention. For whatever reason, when selling/crafting things, you cannot input the number that you want. You have to click the increase or decrease arrows. This was very frustrating when i I was trying to craft 100 bolts or sell my 400 raw metal pieces. If you just hold the increase button, it will very slowly increase one at a time. Not a big issue, but very annoying.","January 10, 2015","false","17.0"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

So lest start with the good points...\n\n1. The graphics are pretty good with creative environments and weather effects.\n2. A Good variety of armour looks and customising options\n3. cool mix of combat styles (setting your sword on fire always makes the arm hair stand on end!)\n4. Interesting storyline from what i've seen so far and the Daemon's dialogue I think is particularly well done.\n\nSo those are just some of the things I quite like about this game so far, I hope these dont change for the worse!\n\nNow for my picky points which both frustrate and disappoint me...\n\n1. The laziness of animations - you enter a new area and think wow look at this scenery, then you see the 'frozen' character standing close by pretending to be doing something important of giving depth to the game. I think this is awful in terms of creating a believable environment and frankly is kinda of lazy. The least they could do is breathe even if the animation is poor.\n\n2. Combat - This is the first game i've come across where heavy weapons (2H) are completely useless and more often than not end up getting you killed! Clearly logic dictates that a two-handed sword does less damage than 2 small daggers... it does in this game anyway. If you want to focus on melee the only sensible option is to go for the rogue line, at least thats what seems to work for me. I find the boss fights great personally but the frustration at times trying to avoid an aoe from out of nowhere makes you want to cry.\n\n3. Companions - the only real use ive found for them is being bait for enemies as most of the time the damage they do is woefully inadequate... the boss fights are more comic than anything watching them attempt to block a knock-down strike!\n\nThis is still a game I'd recommend for people to try though, maybe not at its full price though.\n\n7/10","October 18, 2014","true","18.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I'd say it was worth it, but I definitely wouldn't pay $40 for it.\n\nThe graphics are -awesome-, the soundtrack is great and unique, and despite what others say I liked the characters quite a bit (although the primary is obviously a Shepard clone). I enjoyed the combat as well, although the lack of depth creates redundancy in the later part of the game.\n\nThe worst thing about this game is the length. There are seven Ice Lords and the game ends somewhat abruptly after defeating just one (who was a cakewalk btw). The final boss, while cool, has a RIDICULOUS difficulty spike which is jarring as hell. The story also seemed a bit convoluted at the end.\n\nLet me reiterate that really did like the characters, story, and voice acting, and was actually disappointed that more content wasn't there for them to be fleshed out more. I loved the main character, Shepard clone or not. There are just enough decisions in the game to make you feel like you have some influence, although the whole "choose your demon or humanity" thing is ONE decision that you make early in the game, and you're pretty much stuck with it.\n\nUltimately Bound By Flame never quite reached it's potential.  It's as though you're constantly teased with this awesome new universe that you get to see about ten percent of.

Not extremely deep, but fun. Controls are a bit clunky. You seem to have 2 main stances (warrior and ranger) that have their advantages/disadvantages, in both modes you can shoot your crossbow and use magic. However I'm finding Ranger to be more fun and its much faster paced. I will say the combat is a bit difficult, not dark souls (its not trying to be either), but difficult. (there are 4 difficulty settings if it feels a bit too hard)\n\nGraphics are good, especially the lighting. The textures on some world and actors are a bit wanting though.\n\nStory is a bit confusing. (again, not that far though) Lip sync is awful, but I looked past it in Of Orcs and Men, so I'll look past it again.\n\nOverall, so far its a very good ARPG, especially considering I was able to pre-order for 25 over at GMG. From what I hear its a bit short for an RPG (20-30 hours) but your mileage may vary. Seems to have a little replayability at least because you do have to make story altering choices in the course of the game.\n\nPick it up now if you don't mind looking past a few faults for a very good ARPG, or wait till it hits about the $25-30 mark somewhere. This is one of the better ARPGs to come down the pipeline for a while.\n\nP.S. As of now, don't use the Ultra Shadow settings, put to high.

It's just far to slow to react to blocking, allowing the enemies to hit you, when 2 or more enemies you're pretty much screwed as they will contantly attack you.  Even the normal controls out of combat feel broken and like you're trying to drive a 3 wheel car, there's no fluidity just feels jaged, even when sucessful in combat something just doesn't feel right\n\nMust say I expected FAR more from this...

The combat is simplistic in a good way, and yet not boring or repeatative. The enemies when in groups of variety  make the combat fun and difficult. The enemies combos and attack pauses make them less predictable and add variety. The graphics and animations are smooth and well done. The envirorments are beautiful with dynamic lighting. I get a feel of "The Witcher2" in the combat and the overall game. It also has a slow time combat skill menu almost like "Mass Effect" or "Dragon Age". The armor and art style is "my cup of tea". The voice acting is just ok and the mouth animations don't match the characters lips to well. The story is nothing that will suck you in. Overall a great game, especially for $40.

As someone who went into this game with zero expectations and prior knowledge (and a price tag of $20.00), I was very suprised at how pleasant of an experience this was.

But even with that, they've managed to have a great and varied crafting system, a unique soundtrack, and a 'Witcher meets Baldur's Gate' inspired combat that's rewarding in its own way. I'll mirror other complaints about the horrible voice acting and script, but it's far from stopping this game from being enjoyable.\n\nI will say, keep a few things in mine; the game is short, pick it up when it drops below $20.

From the plot holes to the awful combat, if you want a comparison think Kingdoms of Amalur had a love child with the Gothic/Divinity Series. That might sound good in theory but it fails to be half as good as either. I'll give a little list of the good and the bad:\n\nPros:\nIt's intriguing enough, the story could, as far as I am, could pan out to be quite good.\nThe crafting/customisation system is quite varied.\n\nCons:\nOutdated graphics. - I didn't buy a decent machine to play console games.\nThe combat. If you like pressing 4 buttons constantly with little to no variation in attacks, it's right up your street.\nThe plot holes. This is probably the most frustrating part, I can't even fathom why the writers thought that it would be a good idea to have some one appear mid conversation and give you a choice, so fair enough lets just roll with it BUT even when you chose the out come the game just does what it wants any way? The illusion of choice here is ridiculous.\nThe voice acting. I swear I could do a better job just by putting on muppet voices. It completely ruins it when you build your character in character customisation only to have her talk like she's been huffing paint fumes.\nInvisible walls. Oh man, picture this if you will, you're walking through a forest and see a small ledge that you need to get down, you walk towards it to drop down only to realise because there isn't a trigger there for you to HAVE to press a button to drop down, you can't just walk off the edge.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I get it's not a AAA game but if that's the case, don't release it at AAA price. I mean £30 is a joke.\n\nConclusion:\nAvoid. Just avoid this hot mess of a badly put together game. It feels like a money grab, plays like a money grab and looks like a money grab.","May 10, 2014","false","25.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That was my thinking initially, until I realized that the archers are virtually impossible to avoid, the bosses are predictable and boring, the combat is repetitive as HELL. For example, the only real good way to deal damage throughout most of the game is to use the daggers, and you can play 100% of the game that way, never putting any points into the sword skills. The thing that really gets to me is the voice acting is horrible, the female main character is not worth playing at all, unless you have the audio muted all the time. It's just so flat, reading off of the script for the first time sort of work that makes me cringe.

This game is: mostly interesting, quite challenging, varied, rewarding, somewhat annoying, nice-looking, not quite polished, stable, fairly repetitive.\n\nStory, atmosphere, characters\nThe story was fine by me. The premise is fairly standard (the world that is being overwhelmed by the forces of evil, and you have to stop it - we saw it countless times), but the specifics (what kind of evil it is, and why you) are intriguing. There were a few twists in the story, but they didn't change the overall direction at all. There is the "light path" and the "dark path", but, as far as I understand, you'll do pretty much the same things during the game regardless of the path you take; this influences the ending, though.\n\nThe characters were fine, as well. Not awfully deep, but presented well, and memorable to some extent. They had quite a few things to tell about the world, too. The narrative was uneven: sometimes it went well, but in other places (notably near the end) it became abrupt and lacking. The overall atmosphere and world presentation were good and fitting to the story events.\n\nCombat\nOne of my biggest complaints is the uneven difficulty of the game. At the beginning of the game (after the prologue), the enemies were overwhelming (far more difficult than the mid-game bosses!), later my character gained some skills and things started to become increasingly easy (with some notable exceptions). At some point, I could almost forget about tactics and precise timing of blocks/evades (something that was absolutely necessary at the beginning) and just start running/jumping around with some degree of target prioritizing (kill archers first) and spatial awareness (keep dangerous melee enemies at a distance). And bosses... The first one (from the prologue) was ok, the second one was quite a challenge. The penultimate one was a joke (I beat him on the first try without breaking a sweat), and the final one was more like a hopeless battle (though the atmosphere was brilliant. And that music!).\n\nThe other complaint is how the battles dragged on in mid-game. The reason is that my melee weapons did annoyingly little damage, so I had to chop enemies for a long time before they fell. The crossbow did very little damage as well, which made it pretty much useless because of its limited (albeit craftable) ammunition. Also, there were too much battles that were almost exactly like each other.\n\nCompanions were not very useful. As many reviews stated, they tend to die too easily. They are not entirely useless, though: healing and crowd control spells were convenient and/or interesting, and sometimes a companion could even do non-negligible damage if I managed to keep enemies on me. Anyway, they are there mostly for story purposes. :)\n\nDespite all of this, the combat was actually fun enough. In extreme cases, the enemies could kill me literally in two strikes, and it was quite rewarding when I (as a player) finally learned to deal with them. Having two combat stances with distinctly different features was certainly a good idea (though it didn't work very good for me). Also, I don't usually like traps, but here they were a viable (though difficult) method of combat - and in some cases, pretty much necessary (hint: the final boss).\n\nThe amount of travels was a bit too much (especially with respawning enemies), but manageable.\n\nQuests, development, replayability\nThe quantity and quality of quests was certainly above what I would expect in Action RPG. (This didn't last very long, though: near the end the quests were less numerous and more boring.) There are even the romance options, but I failed to encounter them. :)\n\nCharacter development is interesting, but controversial. Some skills seemed to be too unsignificant (like, +10% damage), while the others were quite important (evasion skills). There are three skill trees: warrior, ranger (more like rogue) and pyromancer. Warrior and ranger skills mostly affect their corresponding combat stances, while pyromancer skills deal with fire magic. There is also a set of perks (or something like this) that are purchased with separate points.\n\nI concentrated on ranger skills with a healthy addition of warrior and pyromancer skills. I know it's entirely possible to level up as warrior or pyromancer, but from my ranger perspective I can hardly imagine it: warrior looks too vulnerable without evasion, and pyromancer looks too weak because magic doesn't do that much damage while mana is in short supply. So I'd expect a very different combat gameplay if I were to replay the game with a different skill set.\n\nEquipment is numerous, and you can craft upgrades for it. For armour, this works good enough: you become increasingly well-protected throughout the game, and you can (and should) play with different resistances (hint: choose universal "magic resistance" whenever you can). For weapons, not so much: I acquired some daggers somewhere in the middle of the game, and everything that I could find later was on par with them, with little variations like damage vs. critical chance. Maybe this is specific to rangers, to balance out their survivability; maybe warrior and pyromancer scale better damage-wise. I don't know.\n\nTechnical aspects\nFrom the technical point of view, the game is decent; I don't remember having considerable issues with graphics, sound, performance or interface. The graphics was quite pretty to my taste, but your mileage may vary.\n\nConclusion\nGet this game, if you enjoy difficult and varied combat, and can deal with a few gameplay shortcomings. Or if you enjoy straightforward fantasy stories, like to learn things about in-game worlds, and don't mind a good deal of somewhat repetitive combat along the way.","June 23, 2015","true","35.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

From the plot holes to the awful combat, if you want a comparison think Kingdoms of Amalur had a love child with the Gothic/Divinity Series. That might sound good in theory but it fails to be half as good as either. I'll give a little list of the good and the bad:\n\nPros:\nIt's intriguing enough, the story could, as far as I am, could pan out to be quite good.\nThe crafting/customisation system is quite varied.\n\nCons:\nOutdated graphics. - I didn't buy a decent machine to play console games.\nThe combat. If you like pressing 4 buttons constantly with little to no variation in attacks, it's right up your street.\nThe plot holes. This is probably the most frustrating part, I can't even fathom why the writers thought that it would be a good idea to have some one appear mid conversation and give you a choice, so fair enough lets just roll with it BUT even when you chose the out come the game just does what it wants any way? The illusion of choice here is ridiculous.\nThe voice acting. I swear I could do a better job just by putting on muppet voices. It completely ruins it when you build your character in character customisation only to have her talk like she's been huffing paint fumes.\nInvisible walls. Oh man, picture this if you will, you're walking through a forest and see a small ledge that you need to get down, you walk towards it to drop down only to realise because there isn't a trigger there for you to HAVE to press a button to drop down, you can't just walk off the edge.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I get it's not a AAA game but if that's the case, don't release it at AAA price. I mean £30 is a joke.\n\nConclusion:\nAvoid. Just avoid this hot mess of a badly put together game.

It looks like it's trying to copy Dark Souls, feels like it's trying to copy Kingdoms of Amalur, and sounds like it's trying to copy a 1st draft of some prequel to A Song of Ice and Fire. If you can ignore some fairly glaring flaws, there are a few things to love here, just don't go in expecting the best RPG you've ever played.\n\nIn Bound by Flame (BBF) you are a member of a mercenary group protecting some scribes as they travel to complete a magic ritual. The ritual backfires, forcing a demon to share your body, and you are then tasked with travelling across the world to help stop an army of deadwalkers (think White Walkers from Game of Thrones) from taking over the world. The story is nothing ground-breaking, but it's interesting enough.\n\nTo start with the things I liked, I found the graphics well-done (until you get right up next to certain things), the story was interesting (even if it was resolved poorly), I liked how the world was ostensibly linear with a bit of side-questing, the simple crafting system was very well-done, and the 1-on-1 combat was quite satisfying.\n\nWhere I found this game to have failings were in the areas of dialog/acting, group combat, unlikeable characters, TERRIBLE final boss fight, and everyone in camp (including vendors) being completely useless.\n\nI have to start with the dialog and voice acting, because they are the crown jewels on the side-crapsalad that this game brings to the table. They are amazingly atrocious, and even though I was laughing at how so-bad-it's-good it was at first, it eventually fell through the floor into plain old inexcusably bad. The dialog sounds like it was written by an 11-year-old trying to be edgy, and the voice acting is so stilted, sloppy, uneven, and messy, that it sounds like it was recorded in a booth completely isolated from every single aspect of production. The cadence that the lines are delivered with makes no sense, and no conversation in the history of the universe would EVER flow the way some of them in this game do. I can't even remember how many times I said some variation of "...are you serious?" while listening to the dialog.\n\nIt's trying far too hard to be edgy, too. I have no problem with profanity and sarcasm, when they fit in the context of the discussion. This game, however, seems to think that just randomly throwing in various adult words and giving everyone a bad attitude will make the dialog more adult-themed, too. Everyone (you included) is a sarcastic ♥♥♥ to everyone else. It's incredibly distracting, and given the wooden acting as well, the whole thing just seems childish. Moments that should be loaded with sad emotion fall completely flat, and moments of triumph or happiness are completely spoiled by poorly-acted sarcasm. It's worth mentioning that I played through with a female character, so maybe the male voice actor is better. Personally, I was rolling my eyes from literally line 1, and I actively disliked my own sarcastic jerk of a character and the condescending demon inside her the second they opened their mouths.\n\nWhile I did legitimately enjoy the one-on-one combat (dodging and parrying were very satisfying to pull off), group combat just ends up being a gigantic frustrating mess. The combat in this game is much more fast-paced than something like Dark Souls, so whereas you could get an attack off against a group of 3 enemies before having to block/dodge/retreat in DS, in BBF, 2 of those 3 enemies will already be swinging before you're even within striking distance, so dodge-dodge-dodge (which only works straight backwards, by the way). If you can peel enemies away from the group to fight them solo, then no problem, but if they refuse to unclump thanks to the cramped combat arenas, prepare for the fight to consist of 98% dodging. That is, unless you've been upgrading the magic, or have been building TONS of crossbow bolts. I didn't focus on those, so I can't say for sure. The un-upgraded magic is a joke and a half.\n\nSpeaking of combat, the companions you can bring along are borderline useless, and the only purpose they serve is temporary meat shield. Plus, there are far too many of them to be able to form any actual attachment with over the course of this short game, so the only emotion you're likely to feel when they die (and they will) is annoyance at having even more enemies focused on you. They do have personal side quests and romance options, but everything is so brief and shoe-horned in that it feels completely meaningless.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of meaningless, a lot of the "choices" you can make in the game are the same way. It's classic Telltale syndrome: Making you think you're making meaningful choices, when in reality, the only things changing are superficial surface-level nonsense. Case in point, 2 companions are arguing over how to carry out the next step of the mission, with completely different and serious outcomes. One says do A, the other says do B. You choose to do A, the B-companion gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and leaves, and you end up having to do both A and B anyway. The choice was never about any meaningful quests, or actions in the story, it was about which companion leaves the party, a consequence that really makes no difference whatsoever. The story unfolds the exact same either way. The only thing in the entire game that can really change (other than your looks and the sound of your voice) is the ending, based on whether you allowed the demon to take over or not. Don't worry, though, the ending is unsatisfying no matter what. Crap might be a better word.\n\nGood luck getting to the ending, though. The final fight is such a MASSIVELY drastic jump in difficulty that, according to Steam achievements, only half the people who beat the immediately-preceding boss ended up beating the final boss, and only half of THEM did it at anything but the lowest difficulty. It is a tedious, unrelenting slog of a fight against an impossibly-strong, test-of-patience of a boss. In the world of horrible final bosses, Bound by Flame is a strong contender for the heavyweight belt. God help you if you're a completionist who gets frustrated by difficulty spikes.\n\nOverall, this game was entertaining enough for me to play through to the end, but only just. If you can pick it up on a decent sale, and you're dying for a new story-driven RPG, it might be worth taking a look, but if you're like me and find it hard to overlook little things as they slowly pile up, well then you might want to put this down a bit lower on your priority list.","September 8, 2015","true","15.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I liked it, I really did. It has some awesome moments, but the Cons really outweigh the Pros the more you go through the game.\nPros:\nFun to play.\nA good idea vs the usual bash/slash em up.\nNice graphics with no stuttering or tearing.\nAdult content.\nOK load times - when changing into an indoor/outdoor area there might be a few seconds or a load screen - but large zones with max graphics at 1080p run beautifully. Textures maybe could have used a touch more work.\nOld School map system - Think Ancient Evil/Diablo overlays - that can be turned on or off.\nMovies are well done and look amazing.\nCons:\nCombat system is really based for a Controller - reminded me of Assassins Creed series - Complicated to start with and frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it gets to be very intuative.\nPoor quest Info screen - needs more detail.\nVoice acting is a bit wooden, but not as bad as some reviewers are making out.\nRanger is NOT a ranger - It's a melee rogue. And not a very good one at that. Even with all my level up points spent in Ranger tree, on EVERY boss so far I've had to switch to Warrior to take them - Even with no points in Warrior tree, it still kicks ♥♥♥♥.\nNPC's are unlovable and probably a bit stupid. A number of times they stop randomly and forget to assist you in combat. Sometimes you are made to take a certain group member with you, then you run into another quest where you have to have a different group member to complete the second quest and they may or may not show up for you - if they do, you may then need to run all the way back to camp and get the original member back. Or you may not - I've had it happen both ways after loading a save where I died.\nLong intro that can't skipped. Gets a bit boring when you decide to try a different base character type.\nFew "nice" options - You are either an a.r.s.e.h.o.l.e., a egotistical a.r.s.e.h.o.l.e. or a uncaring b.a.s.t.a.r.d. Which I guess makes sense considering you have some type of fire demon in you - but what's the excuse for the times you have to make the choice BEFORE you are possessed?\nEnemies are very repeatative and seem to be DPS sponges with Very good AC. I think they are supposed to be scaled to start with but as you progress thier AC gains a lot more points then you do and thier damage increases a lot faster then yours. They also are pretty much the same all the way through - not a lot of new ones as you progress - maybe 4 or 5 new ones in chapter 2.\nThe skill tree upgrades are very poor, basically adding only interrupts or raising skills by very minimal amounts.\nI think the combat mechanics were planned to be a lot more then what they are - Interrupts are not complete and pauses are added in the skill trees for you to complete ripostes or such but there seems to be no controls that allow you - basically you just spam your mouse button or Q for a good kick.\nWhile the skill tree gives you these upgrades you don't learn any new moves or combos. You basically know everything to start with - mouse 1 = quick slash of 1 of 3 varieties that work in a chain, mouse 2 = AOE slash that runs as a chain - it can be interupted. Q will give you a kick, if you do it at the right time/direction maybe you get a flying knee to their face.\nThe ranger tree (rogue) is fairly useless and I'd skip it totally.\nThe Pyromancer tree (Magic) is nice to boost your warrior skills (flaming blade is a great dmg boost to your regular attack and really needed in every fight), but alone it's terrible.\nIt seems the game really does wish to make you focus on the Trapping/Crossbow aspect (it is apparently your specialty), but gives almost no gear for ages compared to standard Melee, and even when it does, it's pretty weak. There are very few upgrades to it and after about halfway thru chapter 2, I gave up using traps completely.\nThe game really feels unfinished and while i'm still working on completing it, I can't see it being a game that I'd replay.\nInteraction with some NPC's will sometimes give you quest dialogues before you even get the quest. EG - I was speaking to a Red Scribe, trying to find out if he was a vendor and A quest dialogue popped up regarding a traitor that I was apparently looking for... Huh?!? Then I spoke to the general and he told me he suspected there was a traitor and could I look for him? Ahhh... OK..\nUnfortunately that was't the only time either. Spoilers right?\nNo option to respec yout skill trees - means if you make a mistake you have to start all over again or load an earlier game.\nQuests can be random fails sometimes and if you don't multisave you can't go back and fix it.\nLook, over all, it's a solid start to a game and I'm enjoying it - I'm about to finish chapter 2 and I'll continue playing it if only to see it finished.\nIf you like a good warrior hack and slash with a bit of fire thrown randomly in various directions - it's worth the Killer 7 Bundle from Bundlestars or I'd wait until it's under $5.\nIf you like plaing a Ranger (Bows etc) or a game with cool magic - Save your dosh. It's not that kind of game.\n5/10 Dragons.\nRun on 6600K/16GB RAM/AMD R9 380 Dual X.","April 28","false","17.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The combat is dreadful, the graphics are mediocre, and the story and voice acting -- for the few hours I could stomach it -- is unwatchable.  I played a female protagonist, so maybe they saved their budget for the male lead, but the lead actress sounds like they grabbed some girl off the street, recorded her first reading of the script and called it a day.

Every boss isn't hard because you have to sovle the puzzle or do something correctly.  They have one attack that just can't be avoided.  Or they want you to switch stances but eveytime you try while in combat you do a move with the currently equipped weapon instead.  The story is good, the characters are good, and the game looks amazing,  The combat and controls are broken.  Your companions are completely useless.  There are several battles where you need to rely on your companion's abilities.  This is a terrible combination of elements.  They, inevetibaly, get you killed.  The Worldheart boss is where I quit.  The whirwind attack the boss does is impossible to avoid.  If you have any of the ranger skills toward riposte and super dodge it will get you killed trying to dodge it.  You can block it but it staggers you with the last attack.   You can weather it well with warrior stance but good luck switching to it in the fly and then back to ranger to avoid the magic attacks.

Fourth, the enemies will always stagger you. Fifth, you swing slower than the enemies, which means you have to anticipate every hit, because there's no instant movement. You can't roll. Sixth, you don't fight enemies one by one. You fight them in groups. Seventh, the archers in that game are deadly, as they can shoot you THROUGH their comrades. Which means that while you're trying to swing, you'll get staggered by arrows, and cleaved in the face by the enemy who just recovered. Even funnier with bosses, since archers infinitely respawn. Eight, you're limited in mana and ammos. The enemies aren't. They can literally spend minutes spamming arrows/darts/poison sphere and win the war of attrition. Ninth, when you hit an enemy blocking, you'll stagger. He won't. Tenth, some enemies have unblockable attacks that are barely differents than their usual attacks.

They have tried copying Dark Souls etc. with hard gameplay but forgot to be tough but fair and you are often fighting enemies who seem god like which little options other than to run around throwing things in the hope you don't get hit by some form of heat seeking laser. Combat is not rewarding and you fight the same 3 enemy types through your entire 10 hour or less time playing this game to 100%.\n\nThe story is boring and is more of a nod your head and go scenario, you're a merc who just nods your head to what people tell you with not personality other than swearing every third word like a 13 year old mid puberty. There is no companion interaction of any kind that you could call interaction, there is no story lines etc. There is a romance, it consists of 2 lines of text and a quickie infront of an old stone with 1 of two characters on the premise that one's a ♥♥♥♥ and the other than daddy issue's (seriously, that is the case they even tell you themselves and it's updated like that in your diary).\n\nThe alignment shifting? It's not alignment and it's not shifting. You make a choice at the end of every chapter whether or not you want the buff to make you more powerful or do you do the nice guy thing that normally ends in the deaths of thousands of people, it's not a good or evil shift and the morphs consist of funny eyes, small horns, 4 small horns and black face and 2 small, 2 big and black skin, the last of which occurs 3 minutes before the final and dissapointing boss fight. Your companions and others do mention these changes... twice... one sentence each.\n\nCrafting becomes your weapon, it's rather simple but fact is the combat is so unbalanced you'll find your self selling everything that you don't use (not that you need it, combat boils down to using spells, running till mana is back, then repeat) and then changing gold into ingrediants and those into health and mana potions. I found i spent 2 hours during final boss fight, about 40 minutes of that was going to and from the crafting menu mid fight to spam making potions. It's dull, simplistic  and you can make potions out of thin air and gold.\n\nThe skill tree is cool but with 25 levels,  you basically can entirely max 2 tree's but that said you can't fight like you want. The game is designed to force you to play how they want you to play, want to be a tank? No shield exists and half of all enemies have to be fought with magic or with the daggers, only the weak and basic enemies are fightable with the sword unless you can perfect their "spam button" parry system which is unbalanced. Much like Dark Souls there is a parry and riposte to allow you to break an attack and counter, combat consists of fighting 4-5 enemies wailing at you and during this animation you will 50% die before the end of it during the slow motion animation of the counter where his 3 friends have been hitting you for 1/3 you're health a piece.\n\nOverall, bad story, bad combat and mechanics. All the pictures for this you see above? Thats the end boss twice, and the other bosses in the game. The big roaring guy? He's the only one you meet and acts as a prologue boss. They are all cutscenes.","May 12, 2014","false","13.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Fourth, the enemies will always stagger you. Fifth, you swing slower than the enemies, which means you have to anticipate every hit, because there's no instant movement. You can't roll. Sixth, you don't fight enemies one by one. You fight them in groups. Seventh, the archers in that game are deadly, as they can shoot you THROUGH their comrades. Which means that while you're trying to swing, you'll get staggered by arrows, and cleaved in the face by the enemy who just recovered. Even funnier with bosses, since archers infinitely respawn. Eight, you're limited in mana and ammos. The enemies aren't. They can literally spend minutes spamming arrows/darts/poison sphere and win the war of attrition. Ninth, when you hit an enemy blocking, you'll stagger. He won't. Tenth, some enemies have unblockable attacks that are barely differents than their usual attacks. Your kick will be ♥♥♥♥ unless you put many points in it. Eleventh, have I mentioned how many HP the monsters have?\n\n\nTL;DR : you're sent against enemies outnumbering you, outskilling you, and with more ressources than you do. You will be forced to cheese to win, and each room will turn into a ridiculous battle of attrition as you run out of traps, bolts, and potions faster than you can craft them.","April 20, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

If they just made healing potions easier to make, or made it easier to upgrade stuff in the beginning so you didn't have to run around like that, it could have been fun.

If you devote 20-30 minutes to trying out the different stances, attacks and timing, it can be very rewarding.  More satisfying -- in that sense -- than DSII IMO.  Actually seems more responsive and the ability to interrupt your own decisions on the fly is enjoyable.  However, if you have no interest in timing, most fights will allow you to spam buttons (and save games) to eventually survive.  There is also an action wheel that slows combat to a crawl and lets you set traps or use ranged attacks.  Again, these systems accomodate very fluid, involved combat if you have an interest to learn them.  Crafting, companion personalities and gear design are above average.  The music is excellent.\n\nOH!  THE DARK:  Characters will constantly stonewall the game with dialog.  By this I mean they will banter back and forth with absolutely no velocity or direction.  I cannot imagine anyone enjoying this, especially considering the camera lock while in dialog.  The game becomes completely inert.  ...  Level design is just short of terrible.  Landmarks are almost nonexistent and there is never the sense that you are learning an area as you explore it.  An above average map system with two display options alleviates some of this but beware if you choose to go without any HUD map.  The developer (Spiders) was clearly making an effort to enlarge the relatively small map spaces.  Which reminds me: Hope you like loading screens!\n\nAll in all, when the game stops getting in the way of the gameplay, it is a fair offering for $40.","May 12, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story is a bit meh, which perhaps wouldn't matter if the actual game world was a bit more interesting. The first two areas are incredibly boring and linnear and both have very little in the way of eye candy and variation, the first area I could forgive for being small and underwhelming, since I figured the game would open up after the player got the hang of it. That wasn't the case by the way.\n\nBound by Flame does however have quite a good amount of customisation, after choosing which sword you wish to use you can change the hilt and pommel to not only make it look purty, but to increase it's effectiveness significantly. The customisation doesn't end with your weapons, you can also customise your armour in the same way, which to be fair I haven't, so perhaps that's why I keep dying.\n\nOverall though, the combat is imperfect, the story isn't delivered well at all and the side characters aren't interesting enough to throw a stick at.\n\nTo conclude once more, Bound by Flame is a pile of literal ♥♥♥♥, that might be worth the money it would cost to compress it into a diamond. I don't completely know what I mean by that, but the gist is - it's almost good, but it's still ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n\n","May 13, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!)\n\nBound By Flame is a single-player action-RPG with great ambitions.. and nowhere near enough funding to realize their goals.\n\nMy honest opinions about the title are thus: the game is good for what it is; it's heavily flawed in many areas, the combat does get repetitive towards the endgame, and the graphics are not the highest tier of this year, by FAR. However, it has a certain charm to it--perhaps its the simplicity of the story, a simple "the world's going to end, we need to put forth our last ditch efforts to defeat the Ice Lords before they can freeze everything, so lets summon a demon and--WHOOPS mercenary gets fire-powers." (That happens in the first hour of gameplay--it's not really a spoiler, trust me.)\n\nThe storyline is fairly simplistic, without many twists and turns--save for one companion whose story is somewhat complicated and, in my honest opinion, doesn't get sorted out as well as it could have. Where the meat of the storyline is, is within your companions--people who haven't got a great deal to do with this war, who all have unique personalities. Sadly, only one or two of them truly evolve throughout the course of the game, and a few of them seem token. However, I remember thinking during my playthrough: "I need to bring this companion along, because I'm curious of what they'll have to say about the events that are to transpire" which, honestly, isn't a bad thing.\n\nSo, overall, Bound By Flame is a mixed bag; the graphics aren't wonderful (I can run them close to maximum with my underpowered PC), the music is .. alright, it's fairly generic, but serves its purpose, the combat is basic, but does the job well enough, the story is simple, but overall enjoyable, and the companions are fairly interesting (and I'll say it, this game does have one of my favorite characters from recent memory! Mathras, whoever voiced him and wrote his lines, were superb on so many levels!)\n\nI do recommend this title, but only to those who are willing to make concessions; I'm fairly certain I'm not the only one who believes the game deserved greater funding than it got, as the game begged to have been significantly longer, and more open-world. The ending sort of comes out of nowhere, and you level up and advance far too quickly for my liking. Overall, give it a go if you get the chance (would recommend waiting for the price to come down a bit; this'd be a great title for a half-off or less sale, if you ask me.)\n\nSo, to all; enjoy if you please, otherwise.. well, Inquisition should be out soon enough. xD","May 23, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Bound by Flame is another lackluster installment in the growing genre of dark fantasy RPG's. Unfortunately, as an expanding genre, Bound by Flame competes with far better titles such as the Dark Souls and Witcher series. This game fails from unrealized potentials. Combat is implemented just enough to have some strategy but not enough to be engaging. A crafting system exists, but without a Skyrim-esque sense of accomplishment or worth. Characters exist but none beyond the range of stock characters in a passion play. A story exists but it hardly feels worth experiencing. A world exists but it doesn't feel worth exploring. These could all be forgiven if all you wished were a simple time waster, a perfectly valid form of game. The problem lies in that the price of this game exits the realm of what I feel is appropriate for a time waster. At $15 to $20 I would not feel this game a failure, but as it is in the $40 territory I have other options which will provide more bang for my buck. There are other criticisms that could be leveled at this game, the laughable overuse of swearing for one, but these only reinforce the main problem that this game feels overpriced for the experience. Not a terrible or broken game but not a game worth full price.","May 25, 2014","false","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But what happens when the protagonist encounters with demonic forces and "handcuffed fire"? We learn further in the review.\n\nThe game falls into the genre of RPG action so that every right step in this category must have an epic story based on saving the world. Therefore, it is not the same in this title, and from the outset adventure you are familiar with the situation in the world. Although this is a relatively brief acquaintance, you will learn everything important and therefore that the world is infected with masters of ice from the north, the undead and cities fall one after the other and can not be defend against this threat.\n\nIn light of these events is like trying mysterious monks called Red Scribes cause ritual, which would be able to reverse this disaster. These monks chose the place of the old ritual and strength as they need in him to concentrate all their strength, they hired mercenaries from the legendary group Freeborn Blades. This group is a relatively new member named Vulcan shoe that person during the game already reincarnated.\n\nThe story begins immediately after the show with the situation in the world and key persons. The hero Vulcan with his brothers in arms trying to defend the place of ritual under great duress undead, when in fact happens something strange and place the desired effect, the monks achieved something truly unexpected and Vulcan give new and powerful capabilities of handling the fire.\n\nThat said, where player game called transfer instructions, introduces him different fighting styles, ie namely hard and slow while fighting style with two-handed weapons, faster with two weapons at once, or ultimately magical style aimed to control fire the player thrown into this world whose survival rests on his shoulders and decisions. The story is thus typical clichés we've already played countless times to save the world from evil through the powerful and mighty.\n\nLike any proper RPG, this game also contains a relatively large possibilities of character development thanks to three different trees, focusing on three fighting styles that can be combined during the fight. In the context of character development, it should be beyond reproach itself selection and editing characters at the beginning of the game. This selection is actually trimmed to a minimum and it is possible to modify the character of the hero and others as they wish, as is the case with other RPGs. There are only five preset options for skin color and six different hair types. By editing the characters end up, which is really very little. On the other hand, the action RPG at most of the time anyway player is looking at your avatar, but it is definitely less.\n\nAs regards the actual combat system, which is in this category of games is very important, he should be commended and works well. Style producers chose what is fun, fast, and in particular it is possible to create your unique combinations by investing in talent trees. Unfortunately there should be a slight reproach konzolovosť control, which would, of course, the PC can be executed differently, thus mapped to multiple buttons. This is not anything terrible and the idol of the genre itself, that Dark Souls is the same control, if not worse.\n\nGraphically but is conferred somewhat weaker, it is seen that this game is being developed primarily for the previous generation of consoles, namely Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In this respect, indeed there is no need to wait any visual revolution, but what should be on-screen instructions, it game handles.\n\nA great addition to the game mechanics is to create different objects, specimens and weapons. This makes it possible, for example, modify your weapon to give more damage, respectively. armor that added with more lives and so on. This drive is easy and intuitive to operate. Any object that can be produced has different requirements for such production. Of course, for example. the handle of the sword will need iron ore, optionally skin to handle and so on. These materials can be found everywhere during play.\n\nPart of that is worthy of praise is a conversational system, very similar to the Dragon Age series. This system allows the player to learn more about the world in which it is located, while it also has an impact on the course of the story, because the player's decisions are reflected in one of two different ends of the game.\n\nOn the whole, therefore, this is a fairly entertaining dose of games, which is seasoned with the hilarious battle system with three different options for improvements martial trees and interesting conversation system, which is not common in this category RPG. If you're a fan of epic expeditions into fantasy worlds, fighting and rapid improvement of your character in the game is not over increasingly argue with a clear conscience reach for this title. Although Bound by Flame is not known from any issuer, or from AAA study and does not even have taken a great marketing massage that resembles the game of this genre, which appeared recently, but has a lot more and that is the fun of this title. Therefore Snap out of his handcuffs and get on with this heroic expedition.","December 16, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It isn’t even worth 5 in my opinion and that’s me being generous. If I had known what I do now about the game I wouldn’t have spent a dime on the thing.\nAt first the game is incredibly interesting, it reminded me of Dragon Age and the plot seemed decent enough; who doesn’t want to become a demon and kick massive ♥♥♥ or not become a demon and still manage to kick massive ♥♥♥. It also got bonus points from me because you DO have the option to play as either a female or male character.\nBesides those few things that is where the good ends and the bad begins.\nThe dialogue and writing can get downright terrible – combined with the voice acting…I don’t think there’s a word out there to describe just how bad it is. I found myself not able to take the character, especially my character, seriously with the voice acting and dialogue choices given. If the writers of the game had simply thought it out a bit more this game could have had the chance to be decent, but that just isn’t the case.\nThis is also the part where I start to say this game is more like HALF of a game as in we got tired of writing it and/or didn’t have enough funds to continue sort of half game. It leaves you more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off than anything else because:\n*SPOILER ALERT*\n\n\nThroughout the entire game that constantly talks about these big badass powerful ice lords you ONLY get to fight 1. 2 if you want to count a gross snuff scene sexualizing strangling a woman, who apparently was an ice lord but is so weak you beat her after 5 seconds of starting the damn fight. Surprisingly enough the regular mob guys she summons were more difficult to kill.\nThe end fight also is completely obnoxious and you’d best be prepared to see the same cutscene over and over and over and over again because even on easy it’s ridiculously stupidly hard with no real reason behind it. It makes little to zero sense being there and overall just confused the hell out of me because I guess we don’t have to kill the 6 other ice lords. Just one is enough now even though they’re taking over the entire world I guess.\n\nIt also began making gross sexist comments towards said female Ice lord once you get her in your party (but I guess you weren’t supposed to know she was an Ice lord, but your character suddenly magically knows at some point in the game). Everyone is included in it, even you! Not that I should be surprised I guess.\nThere’s also the matter of choices. Now at first it seems really awesome and great. Your first choice is to either accept the demon’s advances or to find another way – after this choice you have 1 other before it ultimately doesn’t matter and you can’t stop yourself from turning more demon-like in appearance and getting certain abilities.\nYou want to become a demon? You’d best be sure from the get-go because once you start you can’t magically decide not to accept it anymore. Quest choices also seemed important at first but ultimately lead to the same results no matter what you choose.\nOverall, the game isn’t worth it. It is half finished with a cheap end that makes little to no sense being there other than they might have run out of money to keep going.\nDon’t buy the game – or at least wait until it goes on sale for under 5 dollars because it isn’t even worth the 5.\n","December 13, 2014","false","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The firs thing you'll notice is that the game looks great. It's one of the better looking games I've played recently, especially with regards to the character models. This is definitely an action game, although it has the addcitive rpg elements like leveling trees and learning new abilities.\nThe combat feels like a less rigid Dark Souls and is extremely challening. This is one of my major gripes with the game - the challenge level is so high that it is difficult not to simply drop the controller in frustration and walk away. However, it manages to remain compelling; even after dying several times to a small group of the game's weaker enemies - enemies who can defeat you in three hits if you do not defend yourself - I feel motivated to try again, planning my tactics and practicing the game's very intricate parry/interrupt system. A well done battle is very rewarding, with highly satisfying slow motion shots when you successfully counter an enemy's attack. These will sometimes chain several together, giving a feel reminiscent of bullet time.\nThe only other gripe I have with this game is that the dialouge feels as though it was written by a teenage boy who just discovered cursing. Attempts at being edgy or showing off how rough the mercenaries are just comes off as sophomoric vulgarity that serves no real purpose.\nIf you play Bound By Flame you will absolutely have moments during which you want just ragequit, but if you hang with it, overcoming the challenges can be very rewarding. I recommend this game for anyone who likes action games with RPG elements and gothic fantasy settings and who do enjoy a highly challenging game.","December 26, 2014","true","14.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First of all, only buy if it's on sale. The game isn't horrible but it isn't worth the full price.\n\nThe game had potential. It seemed like they were setting it up for some epic story where you wage a war agaianst these evil forces. Then they took the lazy way and gave it a crap and sudden ending. Not even a cliff hanger either. The combat was alright to start with but it gets really repeditive and many of the enemies were not well designed.\n\nHowever, it filled my need for a new RPG at the time fairly well. All in all I enjoyed the experience but\nthere were things lacking. If you've played The Witcher or Dragon Age you'll find similarities which are nice. Just aren't as well executed.\n\nMy old review is below.\n\n* Old Review\nBeen playing the game for about 5 hours now, so this is a first impressions not a full on review.\n\nThe Combat takes a little while to get used to but it's fun and challenging.\nThe Dialogue suits my sense of humour so I've been enjoying it but the mouth animations are abit off sometimes.\nThe crafting and armour enhancement system is straight forward enough.\nThe leveling up system is reminiscent of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning...which I enjoyed.\nThe story makes enough sense.*(until the end)\n\nThumbs up from me.","December 22, 2014","true","21.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The last of these “freedom fighters” have banded together & think they’ve found a way to turn the tide via a ritual.  Something goes wrong in it & your character is bonded with a flame demon.  The premise is sound where you're possessed by a fire demon & the more you allow it to imbue you with it's powers the more you risk losing your humanity.\n\nI believe that the game is influenced by the Witcher & Kingdoms of Amalur titles, perhaps a tad too much so. The execution of this is where the problem lay.  Choice in itself seems the illusion here, this begins at character creation as you only have 5 pre-generated faces to choose from & you can only choose being a human.  You have 3 skill trees, the Warrior, Ranger, & Pyro tree, unfortunately I didn't really feel any more powerful as I gained levels other then in upgrading the weapons.  You don't get any statistical (STAT) differences when you gain levels, not so much as an added hit/health point per level or increase in in damage or defense.  There are no differences in the weapon swaps one can do; no sword & shield style for the warrior, or spear for that matter, no option for the Ranger to use a bow & so forth.  Your companions, with rare exception are more diversionary then an actual help.  The story is meant to revolve around a male lead, I played a female character & more often then not I was called “Vulcan” even though I’d named her “Jenna”  So many of those little things that are missing & wouldn’t pass the muster had this been a AAA title under a larger company like Bethesda or EA.  I’m willing to forgive many things since this is apparently a small studio that released this title, but even I can only let so much go by.\n\nThe combat, as another reviewer wrote, feels clunky. Part of the issue there is that with the exception of the weaker foes, it doesn’t feel as if you do any significant damage, whereas most of the enemies can kill you in relatively few hits.\n\nThe story gets inconstant & abrupt at the end.  In the first half of the game you’re told about the 7 Ice Lords & their respective armies & how their truce is tenuous.  How all that was ultimately executed was a problem.\n\nIf you still plan on getting this title, wait until it's part of a bundle deal, or expansions are made or it's severly patched &/or reduced in price.\n\n\nAs I wrote above, I so wanted to like & recommend this game.","May 27, 2014","false","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The characters are a little exaggerated and their swearing sounds like a bunch of little children, wich just learned how to do it, and started to practice. Really exaggerated.\n\nThe game description says you can choose a way of a heavy warrior, a fast asasin or a powerfull pyromancer. False. Well, ok, the first two ways of doing thigs ar OK but you cannot be mage neither an archer. This game is concentrated on hand-to-hand battles with timing-based countering system, so dont even think about investing in crossbow. If you are able to finish the game with said (i need to add its small) crossbow and a fireball, which is the only spell you can throw at a distance, well, teach me master.\n\nIf thats not enough for you not to buy this game well, the fighting mechanic of Bound by Flame was the most tremendous anticlimax of my life as a gamer. You MUST concentrate on blocking/ evading (warrior/assasin) or you die. Instantly. Or you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ and start on easy. Then it takes long but eventually you will die by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Without the skill which allows you to counter from all sides as a warrior you are not able to finish the game. Some enemies have attacks so slow you will attack them like 2 times and they maybe will manage to hit you. If you counter them you just countinue the combo on a brainless zombie. But there are other enemies like the second boss and third boss wich respectively have so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fast attack most of the times you wont manage to even see it coming and/or their 3 out of 6 attacks will be unblockable AoE. Oh, did i tell you about evading? Yes, it exist in this game. As a ♥♥♥♥ing backward dashing. No siderolling, no evading AoE without waiting for your attack animation to end and just simply runing away. And thats just billshit. Putting unblockable AoE attacks and no siderolling. The only good thing is that blocking/countering and dashing stops attack animation and instantly block/dash. Yet contols are a little slow, and you are not perfect at timing you will get hit, and trust me, On hard difficulty it will hurt as ♥♥♥♥.","September 3, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Balancing is a bit of and your perhaps better of choosing "easy" to start (changing later on when ur better and understand mechanics better).\nIn the classic term you will progress alot, there's loot everywhere, there's exp to gain everywhere and you can shape your char in many ways. there are 3 distincs talent-trees and also the possiblity, similiar to The Witcher, to change your weapon-style in combat (fluid). Loot can be broken down into it's pieces, which is great initself cause you can still make use of items even when you don't need em anymore, and new gear, potions, etc. can then be craftet from said pieces.\narmor and weapons can be further modified by crafting and later on will offer quite some choices on how to build your char. there's also sorta mini "achievments", like killing x mobs with magic, which then can unlock new passive boosts for your char.\nall in all itemization and char-progression are well done, range combat, magic, meele all feels very fluid.\nyou will also be able to take on of the many npc-companions with you while exploring and fighting, which can be given orders on how to handle battles.\n\nwhat makes the game is the story, the writing and the (english) voice-work. the story is quite interesting and feels mature, seeing as how you don't get one silly expotion after another. npcs tend to use curse-words, are not "well"-spoken and compliment the gritty game setting quite well. your "hero" isn't a cliche anti-hero and lots of the story-dynamics hail also from him struggling with his own little problem. there's one major choice which will affect how the story plays out, your protagonist behaves and even how he looks (tryin to avoid spoilers).\nnpc-followers are interesting themselves, ranging from a ages old undead over a sorta "naiv" kinda scholar bride, a rundown warrior who seeks glory/or death? and and and.\n\nover all story and conversations are very well done and offer the strong point in this game.\nclearly the production quality is not what you would expect from some big publisher, areas and visuals in general are not top of the class and can look a tad run down, chars tend to have blocki and clunky animations and the game world is a gigantic tunnel map with branching paths.\nyet still the game offeres some amazing moments and you would be wrong just to avoid it cause of some negativ reviews it might have got. i can definitly recommend Bound By Flame, perhaps not with a full price tag, but a mediocre "sell".\nThe Spiders Studios pac is quite a good offer on the other hand Mars: War Logs, Of Orcs and Men and Bound by Flame are quite some good value for the price.","March 15, 2015","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That perfect combination of cliches, filler and uncreativity allows me to focus all my attention on gameplay. Which (not surprisingly) is a ripoff of far better games. Bound By Flame is what we would get if Witcher 2 and Dragon Age 2 had an unloved child who tried (failing miserably) to be like Dark Souls and Mass Effect at the same time. Sadly the game works just fine and has no major bugs to speak of, which prevents it from entering so-bad-its-good cathegory which was its only chance to be remembered by anyone. I found it in a bargain bit and for physical copy of a game that had to be burned, boxed and delivered to the store I paid an equivalent of 5 Euro. Its still too much.

I get that it does take a little more precision than what we're used to in hack and slash games, but this just gets repetitive and ultimately boring. Also there's no class system, (because god forbid we play a role in a roleplaying game). However, the big redeeming quality in this game is its story telling. I haven't had party members or a world this memorable since Mass Effect 2 guys.

I can make an accurate 'assumption' on how I feel the game to be. You can decide for yourself if this is helpful or not.\n\nThe game feels like a typical RPG hack 'N slash, there are aspects of it that feel sort of like Dark Souls with the way that combat feels--only without the dodging and dying every five seconds, which I did, alot. Dying, I mean, not dodging--but instead of an annoying dodge mechanic (like so many other games, including MMORPGs, are attempting to utilize and failing miserably) they incorporate a split between a parry and a dodge. Depending on which stance you're utilizing.\n\nParrying and blocking works the same way as it did in Dark Souls, can block an attack or you can hit it at the right moment and disrupt their attack and stun the enemy. But unlike in Dark Souls, where you had to physically attack to get the riposte, in this game it happens automatically as a reward for doing it successfully--and it does the same thing with dodging as well.\n\nThe combat in this game is true to many RPGs, it is an active combat--meaning you have to be FACING your enemy and hitting the buttons to damage the enemy, you have to be aware if they have a shield up and you have ques alerting you when an enemy is about to unleash a POWERFUL ability. Which are ALL very nice touches and one of the reasons why I'll probably stick to this game for awhile yet.\n\nIn most games designed like these (such as Of Orcs and Men and Game of Thrones), even the easiest difficulties are extremely hard--enemies are like tanks and you feel more like a 'poke to death' rather than an actual brutal warrior. In this game? They didn't go that route--they made the enemies health stay in comparison depending on which skills you branch into, but they do considerably LESS damage depending on how low the difficulty is.\n\nNow, I'm a person who doesn't like challenging combat. I'm far more interested in the storyline than in any difficult, or tactical battle. I want to just charge in, obliterate all the enemies, feel like a badass, and progress the story. And this game allows me to HAVE that, whilst also having it's own challenge--but it's at a degree to which I like. DO NOTE, however, that I AM playing the game on Recruit because, as I said, I don't really like challenging combat or combat that forces tactics. I'm a casual gamer, not a hardcore strategist.\n\nAll in all, it's a VERY good game--I noticed NO bugs whatsoever whilst playing it. I definitely give this game a recommended feel. You might like it, might not.\n\nAnd for those of you who might be asking... yes, you CAN change the difficulty of the game whilst playing on the fly. So if a fight is too easy? Make it harder! Is it kicking your ♥♥♥? Make it easier! And it has FULL controller support, giving a seamless flow between both an X-Box Controller as well as Keyboard/Mouse.\n\nEven with the graphics turned low for me (as my computer is not the best) the game's quality doesn't degrade from the experience whatsoever.\n\nDefinitely a game you'd want to add to your library, if, for nothing else, a bit of challenging variety from the staple that most games in this day and age are flowing towards. Less emphasis on perfect spot-on reflexes and more emphasis on a more casual pace in fighting.\n\nOh, and a last piece of advice--Bosses hurt. Alot. Don't get hit by them.\n\nOw, my face.","May 8, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I've finished the prologue and am working on Chapter 1 at the moment.\n\nOh, Bound By Flame. This was the biggest draw to me out of the Spiders Studios RPG pack, always being a fan of multiclassing action-RPGs. Unfortunately, it has quite a rough start. I decided to play the hardest difficulty, expecting the mechanics to be similar to Dark Souls. Rather, the game starts you forced into the "tank" role for the first third of the tutorial - not a good thing for those like me who like to play rogues and pick how I play the whole time.\n\nSecondly, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t difficulty. You go from the spectre tutorial to getting destroyed by a crossbow ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the span of ten minutes. I had to turn down the difficulty once to even get past this encounter with the Ranger role. Then in the first boss fight, I kept getting cheap-shotted; whenever I died, the game respawned me in the Warrior role, despite having been in the Hunter role when I saved, so I had to spend a precious second getting stuck with crossbow bolts while I pulled my daggers out. Because of this, I had to switch to the easiest difficulty, just to make things FAIR.\n\nThe second area seems to be better though; there are no annoying enemies with shields who are near impossible to hit with the Hunter role, and I actually have a party member. Hopefully things will continue to look up.\n\nEDIT:\nSo, I've gotten to what appears to be the end of Act 1, and... I plan to take a long, long break from this game. I tend to like mediocre games; I love Quest 64, Final Fantasy XIII (at least what I've played of it), and other games people view as "... meh," but this game... It's just boring. The dialog isn't interesting, the combat is fun for all of ten minutes past the tutorial, and it doesn't even look all that pretty (of course, it's a great looker for an indie studio going for a realistic vibe). It's a poor man's Dragon Age II, for more than the game it tries to ape costs. Just pick DA2 up on Origin. I might return to finish this... At some point, but for now, it doesn't seem likely.","December 25, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

It s*cks bigtime. It's REALLY BAD. And not even the "good" kind of bad, like Ride to Hell Rettibution or Rogue Warrior, games which are so stupid and ridiculous, that they're hilarious. Nope. This is almost all bad, all the time: boring, bland, uninteresting and not fun at all. It has almost no redeeming factor.\n\nWhere to f***ing start? The story... I never thought it was anything to write home about when I read the synopsis, but...this is just s*it. It looks like a horribly written, lame-*ss knock-off of G.R.R.M.'s work. Except the zombies in here don't even have anything to do with ice, despite them being animated by 7 ICE Lords. There's not even any winter (as far as I played). Why the f**k do they even call them Ice Lords????\n\nThe voice-acting...HORRENDOUS. Everyone talks either like a robot or like they're high on every opiate known to man. The dialogue options make Bioware's wheel of responses feel like a masterpiece. So it wasn't enough that the story was s*it, they also ♥♥♥♥ed up the story-telling with some truly idiotic dialogue. Way to f**king go...\n\nPossibly the worst part of the game is the combat system. I have NEVER seen a game like this that can try so hard and succede to make you look  like a total pus*y when playing it. I know it's supposed to be an RPG first and foremost, but...NO, JUST NOOOOOO!! I never thought I'd see a real time, sword swinging combat that can actually manage to feel more boring, unintuitive and unnatural than turn-based combat. Why does my dumb-*ss, supposedly highly trained, meat-head mercenary character swing his sword like an old man with congestive heart disease that forgot his beta blockers at home? (doctor humor ha ha :-p ) And why is there almost no ammo for the cross-bow in all the terain I managed to cover in the 4 hours I managed to last through this game before I got thoughts of suicide? Despite the cross-bow being much more effective than the pathetic melee weapons in this game. And why do all monsters have pathetically telegraphed attacks to warn you when you have to dodge or block? And why can't I jump or dive-roll? This is HORIRBLE. I'm not asking for spectacle fighter level of combat, like in the DMC or GoW series, but... I dunna,  they could have just riped-off the combat system from the Arkham games. ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS! I mean, WB has no shame in rehashing it in all of its other sand-box games and they didn't patent it or anything. Fable did a much better job in 2004. There's a similar, semi-obscure low-budget pseudo-RPG called Venetica that also did it better. There's no excuse for it!!!!! And since we're on the subject, this is a f**king RPG, right?  Why the f**k is it linear as hell and with horrible corridor-based level design? It should have been a sand-box, ffs... Even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flame demon powers are a joke. Most of them are useless, even the ones that aren't, they waste ALL mana after aproximately 3 casts. And it takes FOREVER to recharge. Because I'm sure that someone getting possessed by a demon, does it so he can look like more of a worthless pu*sy. The leveling-up and character progression system is also bland, stupid, lame and boring. I s**t you not, there's actually a feat that you put a single point in and increases sword damage by 2. WOW!!!! Don't even get me started on the useless daggers and the stealth system, which is more broken and useless than in Fallout 3. Don't get me wrong: the game is EXTREMELY difficult, but for ALL the WRONG reasons: clunky combat with sh*t controls. Almost all fights are won through trial and error and attrition: chaining 2-3 stabbs with one block or dodge and rincing and repeating about 10-12 times until the enemy dies. I am totally serious when I say  I had a fight with 4 guys that actually lasted about 10 minutes. Yeah...I timed it. Thus, the fun-factor is almost ZERO. Why do all the games want to be Dark Souls? If you're going to rip-off a classic, at least do it right, ffs.. Being hard and unforgiving is not the same as being unfair, stupid and not fun.\n\nThe graphics are unimpressive, but serviceable. But even that little piece of praise goes out the window, because the game is optimized like ♥♥♥ and manages to actually run worse than much better looking similar games, such as Shadow of Mordor. Of course...\n\nSo is there anything good I can say about this game, you ask? Well, there's the music. Yeah...as much as I'd want to bash this too, I have to admit: it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing sweet. It suits the general atmosphere and feel of the game perfectly and was actually soothing enough to keep me from throwing my monitor out the window in rage of this awful garbage. Does it redeem the game at all? F**K NO. It'd be like re-watching Frozen, just because you like "Let It Go" (well, Frozen is actually a pretty good movie, especially for Disney standards and comparing it to this game is quite harsh and unfair, but I wanted to highlight the idea that music can't make you like something you don't have any other reason to like).\n\nConclusion: It's not by any chance, the worst game I've played, but it's actually the first one that made me want to be able to get a refund. I got it for 6 euro, which was an 80% discont and I still feel I over-payed A LOT. You really have to have a lot of nerve and some balls of steel to charge 30 euro for this game... Alas, I played 4 hours of if, so it's too late now. Probably never will again. STAY AWAY! FAR, FAR AWAY. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this game, like I did.\n\nScore: 4 out of 10 - PRETTY ♥♥♥♥ING BAD","December 7, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

They are incredibly uneven across existent skill branches. Combat here is all about blocking, dodging, parrying and interrupting.\n\nBut the only way to parry is to time your block or dodge to the very last second.\n\nBlocking can only be done in warrior stance and dodging only in rouge stance.\n\nMagical branch gets a defense buffing spell which barely does anything, and is close to useless thanks to cooldown and mana regen being what it is. And if you thinking about rolling to the side that’s just not a thing in this game. What kills me here is that there are achievements tied to unlocking each branch to 100%, so you would think that investing heavily in either branch is equally valid approach, BUT IT’S NOT.\n\n(Side note - with both XP increasing perks and doing all side missions by the end I was level 26, which isn’t max level, with grand total of 50 skills points to spend in any branch. To fully open either branch takes 36 points, so to get 3 achievements for all branches, that’s 3 playtrues. It’s just not worth it, don’t do that to yourself).\n\nAnd interrupting is the whole thing with some skills have it, some don’t. Some weapons being better at it, some worse, while some not even having it altogether. So pay attention to this stat because you will need it during boss fights.\n\n:phew: … Now me being done with that rant on to the  POSITIVES  of this game, which kind of include everything else. Overall design is pretty thought thru, like wooden scabbard for heavy weapon somebody had to come up with that. Soundtrack is beautiful, visual style is lovely. Maps feel very much hand crafted, but considering that there isn’t a lot of them that’s not very impressive. So I’d say this game is one of those cases where it’s done by artists and not game designers or at least people who can’t read spreadsheets.\n\nGame is not very long, even if you’ll do every sidequest, some of which you may not even find. You will probably finish it in 15 hours. Also play it with controller, keyboard and mouse controls are crap.\n\nP.S.  If you not sure what point I’m trying to make with this review following piece of truth may help. Developer + publisher combo that made this game have next one scheduled for June 28th. And after replaying Bound by Flame this month. I’m looking forward to playing The Technomancer with certainty that it will be beautiful, but also worry that combat in it will be just as cringeworthy. I hope they learned a few things since 2014.","May 4","false","37.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It looks nothing like the screenshots. It was ugly and washed out. I am not sure if something was wrong with my game itself but too late to check now.\n\nAfter you get to talk to some people and notice how non-existant the lip syncing is and how the game would have been better WITHOUT those "cinematic" cutscenes. At least an option to turn them off or something and let the camera stay behind your character would have helped a great deal. Not having to see the akwardness would have worked. Funny thing is that when you talk to NPCs without cutscenes you see exactly that, the game been better.\n\nThen the combat starts... It's never a good sign when you want the combat of a game to end so you can do something else. It's stiff, boring and slow. No feeling of impact whatsoever. The enemies, even on the normal difficulty are annoyingly tough. Even Dark Souls got that part right, where only SOME enemies are tough, not all of them.\n\nI felt I had seen enough after that.","December 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Then the ending was the same three generic tubes with a space baby that told you some screwed up version of the plot that totally contradicted what had been the plot before? Then you got to pick your favourite colour.\n\nThen they had the audacity to "fix" the endings by making them more "happy"... Who the hell asked them to be happy?! It just wanted them to relate to the God damned story.\n\nYou remember the Knights Of The Old Republic games? They had a choice system too, but it wasn't so much: "Good vs Evil", it was more "Reasonable Human Being vs God Awful, Short Sighted ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bag" right up until the last choice. If I'm an evil Sith I've got to look beyond the simple things like currency. Money is great, but if I can convince everyone I'm a good person by doing good deeds and then call on them to fight my enemies knowing they will think me the kindest and most gentle soul in the galaxy, isn't that worth more than asking for 100 more credits?... Ohhhh, the unspeakable evil of Sith capitalism and price negotiation! Those monsters!\n\nWhile we're talking about that, why are Sith evil anyway? Jedi oppress all emotion, even love. Sith are permitted to love. Why is any human emotion this instant, one way ticket to evil? I mean, we can all agree that emotional people do some awful stuff from time to time, but logical people can be uncaring, calculating and indifferent to suffering... The ends justify the means in their eyes. That doesn't sound better than a person who deeply loves his wife and children. Maybe if the Jedi stopped running around trying to murder every Sith there wouldn't be so much conflict?\n\nAnyway, don't buy this rubbish. Maybe have a snack instead.","June 4","false","20.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GMCamulos/recommended/243930/","GMCamulos","twitch.tv/gmcamulos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GMCamulos/","521 products in account","Bound By Flame – Review\nBy GMCamulos\n\nGenre: RPG\nPlatform: PC, PS4, PS3, 360\nPublisher: Focus Home Interactive\nDeveloper: Spiders\n\nWhen creating a game what do I want to add? A nice dash of action, some good graphics, great sound in both music/ambient and voice acting, a nice control system, a hint of swearing, a little somethin’ somethin’ for the guys, and conversely nice looking guys for the ladies out there, some good story elements, nice character progression and levelling and a metric tonne of other small little things that fill in the gaps between the aforementioned.\nNow, can Bound By Flame find the right mix or has the ever omnipotent game master added a dash too much of one ingredient and not another?\n\nGameplay:\nBound By Flame was an interesting one pre-release. It looked like it had something really kicking for it. A nice combat style, a demon possessed player character (true we have seen a lot of those in the past), and hey, it was next-gen.\n\nWhat we got from it was a fun solid (in areas) next-gen RPG. The story for Bound By Flame is that your character is a member of a mercenary force called the Freeborn Blades that are trying to protect the world from the Icelords who slowly taking over and killing anything they come across. The Red Scribes who hired the mercs to protect them while they find an ancient temple and try to perform a ritual to help out… can we see where this is going?\nThe ritual obviously has to go wrong cause is the start of the game and all, and your character is left with a very nice and friendly demon residing in him… I mean let’s see, how bad could that actually be right?\nThe demon will eventually try to get you to make the choices which suit IT best, which can lead to a very interesting storyline as your companions will treat you differently if they think you are turning evil.\nSo should you embrace the evil and grow an awesome set of horns and look like you are constantly warming up people three towns away, or will you keep your humanity and make choices that help rather than hinder?\nWell if you go evil you will find that the demon can be a nice kick into the powerful meter, but the choice is yours.\nIt’s just a pity that its strongest feature is a nice combat and skill system. The three skill trees are Ranger, Warrior and Pyromancer.\n\nI dare say you only spec into one of the Ranger or Warrior classes depending on how you want to play but some of the Pyro skills are very complimenting, such as the ability to have a nice fire shield or even ignite your weapon for more damage.\nA quick warning before moving on, the game did kind of shock me the first time I met an elf and my whole opinion of how they can converse was tipped upside down. The occasional swear in a game is fine, but when half the cast will try to slip one in every third sentence, it drags away from it being a fantasy game and just tries to tip into a game for less mature players.\nAnd don’t get me started on the fact that one of your more… well-endowed female companions looks like she could be shivering just looking at a fridge given what she is wearing… I still don’t understand the need to make a female character in a game have less protection than a male character… breastplates on guys… yet a breastplate on a girl will cup the breasts and show them off… I just don’t get it…\nAnd given that there is crafting in the game I kind of wish there was more I could craft, though the recycle feature to get some materials back is a very handy touch to let you experiment with what you want to make and use/upgrade.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game is next gen, so I would have liked to have seen a little more… pezaz?\nDon’t get me wrong, it’s still solid and I can’t really fault it, but it’s still just at a level that says… yeah, we know we are making things for next gen, but we need it to work on everything else at the same time.\nNice little touches pop up here and there, such as the changes your character goes through the more you let your demonic inner voice take over… but its things we have seen before in other games.\n\n\nSound:\nThe sound is good, if we don’t talk about the lacking performance on the majority of companions. There is something to be said about your demon side and his influence and conversational chats, but the majority of the team seem to let me down. A nice casual chat while a player dies, no inflection of pain or regret, just “Yep I am dying…” ok, yeah, thanks… I mean, don’t say that, it’s not your time… bit more work could have gone into this side of the game, and I don’t just say that because I know a lot of voice actors who could use work *wink wink*\n\nSkill Levels and Controls:\nBound By Flames combat never really had me at a point where I felt UBER as I quite often get to in other RPG’s.\nThe game really does ease you into how the combat and levelling works at a nice solid pace in the first section, and just keeps going from there. On normal it still felt like the monsters of the world were levelling at the same time I was, it’s just that I was able to put points into my skill tree’s that continually allowed me to stay ahead of the curve.\nSome fights still gave me a bit of a headache, but still, nothing you can’t overcome.\nYour choice of companions can also help with battle and thus can complement or just strengthen your play style, bit of a choice there to help out as well.\n\nReplayability:\nWith the amount of choices in the game, and deciding what you want to do, the game has a little replayability unless you want to see what it’s like to swap from allowing the demon to take over, or to be the man in charge all the way through. But it’s an RPG, when you know the story, you know the story. Nothing major is going to change from playing through it again.\n\nLast thoughts:\nI did enjoy Bound By Flame, it’s a great little RPG which does have a lot of merits. I do kind of wish the game was longer and had a bit more variety, but hey, on the whole I did enjoy it and had a lot of fun playing through it all the same.\n\nI give it 7 Demonic Possessions out of 10.\n","June 13, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deveritus/recommended/243930/","Deveritus","[永遠の]DC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deveritus/","39 products in account","Potential spoilers: you have been warned.\n\nBound by Flame is a game that, while not something I would have felt incomplete without playing, I did find enjoyment in. Kudos to the creators of the game for giving me a game that genuinely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the first dozen times that I attempted the final boss. I haven't gotten mad at a game like that in a very long time. Granted, that was part of my own ignorance, but I'll explain why in a moment.\n\nThe storyline to Bound by Flame is rather generic and without true backbone; you become the host to an entity that holds the power necessary to help put an end to the "war" going on between the Ice Lords and the rest of Vertiel. You wind up having to focus on choices of morality—do I let the demonic entity grant me power, causing me to lose my humanity, or do I keep my humanity and struggle through things? My first playthrough was done via the demonic choices; I wanted to see what it would be like if you succumbed to its influence. So, the first chance I got, I accepted the demon's offer, and from then on, I didn't quite get the feel that I was actually given a choice to combat the demon quite like that one turning point. Perhaps it was more subtle, such as choosing to help certain people instead of striving to purify the Worldheart, but these are things that I suppose I will find out during my "human" playthrough.\n\nAside from this demonic being's attempt to sway you, there isn't a whole lot to the story. Yes, there is a war going on. Yes, you will eventually storm an Ice Lord's domain and have to fight him, but here's where the reason is for why I gave this a positive review. Being as confident as I was with myself after defeating Lord Blackfrost's concubines, I figured I was safe to take him down and finish the game. I knew I would have to purify the Worldheart, but I figured that was just going to be something that happened via cutscene. So, when I was asked if I was ready to enter Lord Blackfrost's realm, I was under the impression that it was the final boss, and I figured "yeah, I got this". I had no healing potions, a couple dozen bolts for my crossbow, and a lacking Pyromancer skill tree (I was a ranger stance fighter).\n\nBlackfrost was no problem, but they caught me by surprise when they took me into the Worldheart where it was revealed that, lo and behold, there was another boss to be fought. Fighting with scraps, I spent a good 4+ hours beating my head against a wall, trying to defeat the demon there. They did a final boss fight the right way. Compared to the rest of the game, which was rather easy to stroll through, the final boss is the absolute highlight of the game. I'll probably come back to this review as I try a more in-depth playthrough with my human character that I've started up.","December 12, 2015","true","20.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But are they blinding bad? No. Just not what you'd expect from a brand new game with such price.\n\n- The character creation is still pure blasphemy. You can't have a RPG with such a limited character creation in modern gaming - pick from very few premade faces and hairstyles (in ONE color)? Yeah, no. This part for me is unforgiveable.\n\n- Very difficult combat which might turn the least patient or least skilled player away. The difficulty levels are not balanced like you'd expect them to be.\n\n- Animation issues such as character lip sync and lack of facial expressions: without holding back it looks absolutely terrible. One can easily get over this by not focusing on it but it's still baffling they didn't give more focus on this part.\n\nAnd now the positives:\n\n- The story and characters are interesting and unique. I saw few people mock the dialoque in their reviews but in my opinion it is absolutely genius. You rarely see such humor in RPG's and I personally find it very refreshing. I also want to give high points to the voice acting which goes hand in hand with the quirky dialoques.\n\n- As opposite of the negative: it offers lots of challenge what it comes to combat so if you seek a challenge this one is for you.\n\n- Simple yet fair crafting system + talent boost system.\n\nThat is all. Now do I recommend this game? No, not right now. Not in the current price. When it's on sale? Absolutely.","May 9, 2014","false","8.9"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","20","43","0","0"

Though this doesn't mean the game is bad this does mean the game is making the combat tedious. Though i do find the game challenging its mostly due to the fact, the heavy weapon doesn't feel like it has enough backing behind it and the daggers seem like the better option. And don't get me started on the crafting system... I wasn't even able to get to a town yet to buy potions before i threw down the controller since you need 12 tainted blood to make health potion. Doesn't seem to difficult right? wrong. You would have to literally farm from the undead horde if you wanted to make the health pots which makes the crafting entirely unsatisfying.

It takes alot for me to not be dissappointed by a game's parts, so for all means, this will be some ♥♥♥♥ thrown at the game itself.  Judging the game off its worst parts, it would be a terrible game.  If, however, you're willing to not be looking for a mass media level game, which this isn't, then you will be disappointed.  You run that risk on any games not made by the companies who have been doing this year after year.\n\nSpiders doesn't seem to have been in business all -that- long.  The only time I'd ever heard of them before was in Mars: Warlogs, which made me hesitant at first.  The voice acting and mechanics in Mars: Warlogs, were unrealistic and clunky respectively.  To point out a few things, the first few women I met in Mars: Warlogs made me want to gouge out my eyes, and the combat left me feeling like I was trying to throw a bag of meat out of the way of bullets while being constantly wrecked.  Thinking back on it, its mechanics may have been better suited to a medieval RPG.  That's where this game comes in.\n\nOnce again, we live in clunk city for the combat.  As interesting as it was, as difficult as it may have been while still being possible, it was in the end a bit rediculous to use.  It wasn't the most aerodynamic thing, and for the life of me, I could never seem to get the parrying right.  Crossbows seemed vastly underpowered, and I only seemed to be able to find 3 different crossbows, though that could be because I didn't end up searching endgame corpses.  The game brings this back with its magic.  I loved the constant balancing between casting time and trying to formulate a plan of attack.  Trying to use only one of the branches would usually leave you pretty beat.  (Except the OP rangers, but they have bombs.)  Balancing magic casting times and sword swings, you had to be able to think on your feet in order to dodge, block, and flame your way to victory.  This aspect could be re-done so many times, its replayability is quite nice.  The combat, overall, was a good thing.\n\n*WARNING, SPOILERS BELOW*\n\nWhat wasn't so good, was the storytelling and the arcs you were forced into.  I realize the game has to be created around a story and allowing people to make choices causes you to have to script more, but did you really have to make sure the same events took place regardless?  And then, in the end, you come down to two answers. . . based on a question you were asked near the beginning.  Now, that is ludicrous for two reasons.  Firstly, their question was near the beginning of the game, meaning your endings were decided right next to the beginning, with no questions about it in between.  Secondly, they asked you whether or not you wanted to use a demon's power.  Not only did they never ask how far you would use it, but they never warned you that you would lose all humanity.  They said your souls would combine, and warned that you might lose humanity, but in the end, even with all the horns and burning skin, your character still SPEAKS human, and still ACTS human, with fire of course, but not much else.  They try to tell us that we lose control or something if we take the demon path, which is BS.  The way I had seen it, there honestly should've been the chance to oh. . . I don't know. . . GIVE YOUR LIFE LIKE A MARTYR?  I honestly thought that was where they were going.  They said that the demon could grant powers, and others encouraged you to use it.   To save humanity that is.  And in the end, it's like star wars, and you became the Sith. . . without meaning to in the slightest.  That seems quite unfair, honestly.  And yet, it caused me to play the game again, so I must be the idiot in this situation.  Even after all that, and I mean, for a while, that made me mad, I did think back on it, and it does make sense.  I relate it to the holocaust, honestly, because for so long, the humans in this story, much like the Jewish in WWII were hunted down, and exterminated.  But what could they have lost in trying to break free?  Most who were killed, to their dying breath, still stood for what they believed in, and when they died, they died in peace.  Honestly, the option to become a demon shouldn't have even been an option, because that purpose the humans have, it could've become far more prominent.  And that's why I find it more a broken feature than a folly in itself.  It's forgivable.\n\nThe music is among some of the best I've heard lately.  I want to know what language the songs are in so bad.  The final battle, I lived for that moment when my heart started beating heavily, and the mirror demon began to fight our protagonist.  And suddenly, it was all over.  And it felt like it was over.  It left no room for idiocy, though space for another game.  They let you wrap up with everyone, and that feels like it was important.  You could see the ending knowing everything was over.\n\nNow, to relate this game to a mega corporation's product like Dragon Age, that'd be too harsh on this game.  Currently, anyways.  But it was worth a try, and I for one have been impressed by the powder master, Vulcan, and his adventure.  I look forward to seeing if Spiders gets even better for their next game.","October 17, 2014","true","17.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It's one of the worst games to ever exist in this rotten world. Everything, from gameplay to story and level design, is absolute, irredeemable garbage. The difficulty is purely artificial, and final boss fight is absolutely ridiculous. It's not even "challenging difficult", in fact it's a boring fight that makes you repeat the same things in a pattern for hours, and heavens may grant you mercy if you don't stick to the plan (they won't, though). Gameplay is bland and repetitive, level design consits of small linear locations with enemies respawning out of your ♥♥♥ (literally), and on top of that you have to roam the same old narrow paths back and forth a couple of times when they already grow old on your first exploration. The game's plot barely holds itself together as it's main goal is being edgy just for the sake of it, and while I usually have absolutely no opinion about characters swearing and acting like a bunch of angsty teenagers despite being grown-ups, somehow it gets really, really annoying here. Companions are utterly useless, they're probably only there for the sake of shoehorned "romance" that does absolutely nothing for the characters themselves. Of course, it's hard to do something about the supporting cast who're about as three dimensional and entertaining as advertisement leaflets. Oh yeah, if you don't want to miss out on that, you'd better forget about swapping one useless tool for another equally useless one. Subquests are pointless and exist for the sake of attempting to make you feel bad for not doing them but joke's on the developer, it's impossible to give a damn about anything in this game, especially demise of some unfortunate fool with 2 lines of dialogue total. Crafting, while present in this game, is absolutely useless.\n\nConclusion: if you want to play a bad game developed by the same studio, but of a slightly more tolerable degree, look into Mars: War Logs. The boob bait in this game isn't worth it, even if you're less than 18 years old.","November 7, 2015","false","10.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's one of the worst games to ever exist in this rotten world. Everything, from gameplay to story and level design, is absolute, irredeemable garbage. The difficulty is purely artificial, and final boss fight is absolutely ridiculous. It's not even "challenging difficult", in fact it's a boring fight that makes you repeat the same things in a pattern for hours, and heavens may grant you mercy if you don't stick to the plan (they won't, though). Gameplay is bland and repetitive, level design consits of small linear locations with enemies respawning out of your ♥♥♥ (literally), and on top of that you have to roam the same old narrow paths back and forth a couple of times when they already grow old on your first exploration. The game's plot barely holds itself together as it's main goal is being edgy just for the sake of it, and while I usually have absolutely no opinion about characters swearing and acting like a bunch of angsty teenagers despite being grown-ups, somehow it gets really, really annoying here. Companions are utterly useless, they're probably only there for the sake of shoehorned "romance" that does absolutely nothing for the characters themselves. Of course, it's hard to do something about the supporting cast who're about as three dimensional and entertaining as advertisement leaflets. Oh yeah, if you don't want to miss out on that, you'd better forget about swapping one useless tool for another equally useless one. Subquests are pointless and exist for the sake of attempting to make you feel bad for not doing them but joke's on the developer, it's impossible to give a damn about anything in this game, especially demise of some unfortunate fool with 2 lines of dialogue total. Crafting, while present in this game, is absolutely useless.\n\nConclusion: if you want to play a bad game developed by the same studio, but of a slightly more tolerable degree, look into Mars: War Logs. The boob bait in this game isn't worth it, even if you're less than 18 years old.","November 7, 2015","false","10.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It plays no differently, on the surface, from most other action RPG/hack and slash hybrids, but it doesn't play as well as them either. While any of both your more popular hack and slash games and true action RPGs like Witcher 2, Darksiders, Darksiders 2, DMC 3 through 5, Metal Gear RR, God of War, and dozens of others utilize well built control schemes to condense various types of magic or abilities into one place, Bound By Flame makes the mistake of forcing you into a more MMO-familiar numerical menu, or quick-wheel which pauses the action, in order to do anything more advanced than swing a sword. In addition to this, the game utterly lacks a proper dodge function.\n\nYou can parry or dodge, but you can't do both in the same stance. If you use warrior stance, you can parry, which doesn't particularly help against large groups of enemies which can easily murder you regardless of parrying if more than one enemy hits you. Combined with the fact that you barely gain any HP from new armor or even levelling up, and you spend far too much time being a weakling that can be taken down by a pack of even the weakest enemies. If you use ranger stance, your combat is much faster and you can actually dodge - whether timed correctly or not - and it's quite disappointing that you just can't play the game without another stance.\n\nIn addition to that, while the premise of the game is for you to balance or choose between flame demon and human, you really have no choice but to use fire magic to accomplish anything. It's just too bad even after putting skill points into it, your spells still cost so much mana.\n\nAs for the story and the dialogue, they really aren't special enough to earn any praise. The dialog combines a lot of modern English and profanity (not that there wasn't profanity in the old days) with the demon speaking in strictly Shakespearian English - to the point where the juxtaposition is just ridiculous. While I would like to be interested in the story, I find myself skipping through the dialog and cutscenes once the subtitles have displayed so I can get back to the game. Interactions with party members also seem ridiculous and overall your characters attitude is juvenile and callous, down to the wording he uses when he talks to people.\n\nI really wouldn't buy this game until it's on major discount - 10 dollar or less. The overall quality of the game combined with how short it is doesn't merit even the $20 I paid. If you need an action RPG fix, this will satiate you - briefly, at least, but I fear it will not tide you over until a better game releases.","October 13, 2014","true","14.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

It has a story and setting we've all seen a thousand times before, done better, by games like Dragon Age, The Witcher, and even Bethesda RPGs and their clones. It has combat that is remarkably broken, with enemies tanking several multitudes more attacks than your weak and pathetic ♥♥♥. It has exploration that consists of running down one or more copy-pasted corridors. The loot is uninteresting, the characters are forgettable, the voice acting is poor, and even the mediocre action-RPG gameplay is a far cry from that of so many other RPGs.\n\nI wish I could say more about this game, but I played under 2 hours so I could refund it. I bought it on sale for about $8, and that was still too much.\n\nI don't see what other people do in this game, as it just feels like a ghetto and ham-fisted clone, not unlike the soulless GTA clones pumped out for easy cash that we saw years ago. This game doesn't have a single unique bone in its body that isn't stronger in another game. The fact that the sitting MSRP for this as of writing is $29.99 is sickening to me.

That being said, I honestly don't think it's worth more than $5, if that. I watched the trailers for this game and I thought, "Hey, this looks pretty awesome. I can see $25 for this." The trailers, as I suppose is their job, made this look great. In actuality it is a sub-par, bad looking, even worse written, boring mess.\n\nThe graphics just look "off." During the cutscenes the characters always seem way too shiny. (Hey! I like to wax my face!)  Maybe that's just me. I had issues where creatures got stuck in walls, where arms disappeared, etc.\n\nLet's not even start with that lip syncing. My god, the lip syncing. There again, they could have got that spot on, but with the horrible voice actors they used it wouldn't have helped. (Sybil especially comes to mind.) Something else I found funny were (or sad, depending on how you look at it) were the copious amounts of spelling errors throughout the game. At one point they even spell the main characters name, "Volcon." (I kept waiting for them to call him "Voltron.") There were also many times where complete lines of text wouldn't be spoken, or things that weren't written would be.\n\nOh yeah. 15 second music loops are my favourite thing about the game. Hey, if you're going to have music, at least don't make that garbage so short and repetitive that it DRIVES ME IN EFFIN' SANE!\n\nCombat is repetitive and boring. It was touted as being "strategic," but I could find nothing of the like as I played. I spent most of the time in the Warrior class and spent most of my points there and in the Pyromancer class. I barely touched the Ranger, as I quickly found it was mostly useless. You also can set traps and fire a crossbow, but in the end I spent most of my time mashing Y/pressing light attack, using a fame sword/guardian flame, drinking a health potion (you'll do A LOT of this)... wash, rinse, repeat. And hope you don't get spammed by the cold (slow) spell and stuck in a corner from one of the maybe 12 or so different types of enemies in the game.\n\nOh yeah, one thing I never could figure out is, you're fighting Ice Lords, who are in or create ice areas for... hmmm... at least part of the game, yet your magic users use ICE SPELLS on the enemies?? WTF?\nOk, so to be fair, the story was what made me want to buy this game in the first place, and that can't be so bad, right?\n\n\n\n\nwait for it...\n\n\n\nTo quote one of my favourite words from the game, it's "godsdamned" terrible. I mean, I'll give 'em this, they were thinking ahead. They knew it was too terrible for just one god. They had to go create other gods to share in how bad it is. Think of it like this:\n\nYour buddy takes a crap. He says, "Hey man, come here. I want to show you something!" So obviously, you follow him into the restroom to see what's up. "Check this out!," he says, pointing down.\n(Ok, so we all know what you're going to say. Don't think we don't.) "Hey man, that's a pretty awesome crap!"\n\nBut in the end, it's still just a floating turd. But hey, at least you got to share it with a friend, right?\n\n\n\n**SPOY-LARZ** (skip to bottom if you don't want any story info)\n\n\n\nSo you're this guy, right... Well, one of five whole guys you can choose from at the start anyway... and you are part of some mercenary group. You cuss a lot and act like a complete douchenozzle and how anyone could care about you as a main character is beyond me. So these stone cold killas called the Ice Lords destroyed the world and raised a dead army. (There are seven I think. You only see one in the game and they call what I think are the same other six by so many different misspelled names I thought there were like 15 by the time it was all said and done.)\n\nAnyway, you and your Merry Men are protecting some librarians doing a ritual. It screws up, and a demon flies up your butt. He wants in your head, but that doesn't happen until later.\n\nYou go to a city in a swamp, an elf city, some sewers, and the Ice Lord's castle. That's about it. You can talk to your companions on the way, but with those voices who the hell'd want to?!?\n\nThere is one real choice in the game that I can see. There may be two others, although I think they are predetermined based on the first choice. If you choose to let the demon begin to possess you is the only "real" choice I can see in this game. You can choose to save the elves or take the power of a creature, but I have a feeling that, as well as the ending are set once you make that first choice.\n\nIf you choose to let the demon possess you, as I did, by the end of a game you'll become a flamer. (No, you'll seriously be completely on fire. What did you think I meant?!?) Go kill the general, go into the Worldheart thing, and fight another demon. Then BAM! it just... ends? Ummmmm....\n\nSo in the end, Bound by Flame has some pros and cons\n\nPROS:\n\nCool name\nIt's a video game. That's good, right?\nIt's funny if you like to clown on things\n\nCONS:\n\nIt costs more than $30, $20, $10, $5. Wait?! I paid money for THIS!!?\nHorrible story, voice acting, music writing spellinggraphicscharacterdevelopmentcombattttttttt.....\nIt's been godsdamned. 7 out of 8 gods agree!\nIt licks more balls than my dog","May 18, 2014","false","17.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/243930/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","TLDR: Bound by Flame is bound by design 5/10\n\nFirst, I have around 15 hours in this game and Steam is displaying my time played incorrectly. Second, they thought they were clever with their combat system from Mars War Logs but it sucked and they went ahead and put it in this game anyway. $40 new (I paid $20) for fifteen hours of completely linear gameplay with no reason whatsoever to play the game ever again after you beat it is a joke. I paid $20 and feel ripped off. $10 would be more fair. It is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played because the combat is just not very good at all, just weird, and I was not often enjoying it until the last boss. It is so bad that I said F it and am now looking for a trainer to cheat and beat the boss then uninstall this dog crap for good. I was doing well, eventually beating all of the enemies in the game but this game is just unacceptable on the last battle and I am in no way ashamed to say I am just tired of this game and am getting a trainer for it. I do not care. The only thing I am ashamed of is to say I wasted $20 on this game. I have no doubt that if I actually tried a few more times I could beat the last boss but I am just so sick of this I do not care anymore. Every battle is insanely hard, and not exactly always in a good way. The game can still manage to be fun if you are a very skilled gamer and have a astronomical amount of patience, and I do not have much of the latter. The fetch quests and general running around is insanely boring and feels pointless even though it isn't. Everything is incredibly easy other than the combat. Find something, click mouse 1 to pick it up, take it back to person, add some dog crap awful combat mechanics in, and there you go. Oh and by the way, even on the LOWEST difficulty, the last boss fight is nearly impossible. I had said before that the worst final boss fight in the history of video games was Cavestory+ but this one takes the cake. Whatever tiny bit of fun I was having throughout the game was crushed when I got to the last boss fight. It blows my mind that it is not the chief complaint about the game among all of the user reviews. The combat in the game sucks. Even fights against weak enemies put you at such a disadvantage that it will be a chore to beat them, and it is all because of the controls, how you feel like you are fighting on the moon but the enemies get to attack at normal speed.\n\nOh and a problem equal to everything else is how short it is. It is supposed to be a $40 third person rpg and it is only about 15 hours long and is 100% linear with no point ever playing through it twice, not ever. It is a 100% ripoff. The other problem is that the skill trees completely suck, all three of them. They barely add any improvements to your character and the improvements that the skill trees do add are stupid and nearly useless. And when you get new weapons and armor throughout the game, their stats only increase a point at a time. The one-point increase that a new piece of gear gives is negated by the fact that enemies gain strength as the game goes on. The weapon and armor that I ended the game with felt the exact same as the basic ones I started with, because they basically are. You never do more dmg, you never prevent more dmg, and the skill trees offer nearly no help.\n\nSeriously fk this, this game is a prime example of why piracy exists and why not nearly as many people pre-order games as they did five years ago. If the devs for this game are smart they will do it right in the future and scrap this game's awful combat system, if they even made enough money off of this game to make anything else.\n\n4/10 combat engine\n0/10 last boss fight\n3/10 skill trees are nearly useless\n0/10 armor/weapon upgrades because of enemy strength scaling negating any improvements\n3/10 length. actually since it sucks so bad I give the length a 9/10, should've been even shorter lol\n5/10 overall\n\nThey need to seriously scrap this game's combat engine and make a new one for their next game.","October 11, 2014","false","6.0"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

Its an ARPG, but the game-play is very much lacking in the combat and class building, but keeps and expands on the gear crafting that was a main feature in Mars. If you like Mars, you may very well like this. I dislike that I can't roll and enemies don't seem to react to damage what so ever in most cases, I hit you with a sword, flinch at least! I like the story and the voice acting is okay, there is no point in naming your character since they call you by the default name, and the character creation might as well not be a feature for how little you can change. I hope they update this game till then I say stay away, nothing worth the preorder for disappointment, not worth full price due to its lack of basic combat mechanics and 'choices'. -Heretic","May 8, 2014","false","1.2"," 18 of 42 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","18","42","0","0"

The graphics are really bland and dated, with basic textures, blocky shadows and are pretty unrefined to look at (and I am playing on high/ultra at 2560x1600). Some nice lighting occasionally distracts, but not enough.\n\nGameplay is very basic and is largely a left/right mouse button mash. There is no real dodge mechanic which really irritated me as a ranger-style player since all I can do is jump back and then try to sprint around the back of my enemy. I could have used some greater agility to feel like a nimble rogue.\n\nStoryline is ok, but quite generic as well. Voice acting is overall quite bad with most actors sounding like they are mildly bored  reading from a script. Characters barely emote or move in conversations, with no face emotions and exceptionally bad lip-synching. Totally destroys immersion for me.\n\nThe game this most reminds me of is Demonicon in terms of overall quality, looks and gameplay. If this was on a cheap deal and you were after a hack-n-slash RPG-lite that's not too pretty, then it would be a decent timewaster, but it's no big budget AAA RPG that will consume you for hours.","May 8, 2014","false","2.0"," 13 of 34 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","13","34","0","0"

Select the female as your antagonist and you get a better voice-actor. Also known as the Jennifer Hale effect. The voice actor is still limited by what Spiders wanted her to do, but she makes the most of it, though I sometimes get the feeling that even she was close to calling it a day a few times.\n\nSpiders didn't bother to motion-capture a female fighter though, so if you go with the female you'll get one who carries herself like a beefcake would. Given the quality of the antagonist's female voice-acting, that's a shame.\n\nGraphic options enough to be impressed, but even on full graphical detail the game is a drab and dreary 256 shades of brown.\n\nFacial animation is non-existant and the characters speak from the corners of their mouth. Its hard to watch and not at all made easier by the wooden animation of the characters as a whole.\n\nFighting is mixed bag of ideas with combat difficulty being of the 'light attack from monster, you lose half health' while your attacks barely register. It gets better once you get pyromancing abilities, but on the whole I find the combat very tedious for an action RPG. If my toon swings a basterdsword that is counter-weighted, it should demolish an enemy. Blows like that are hard to recover from. Yet, any ememy you encounter will shrug your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sword's blows off like being tickled with a feather. Get stunlocked over and over again until you have to reload. That's BbF's combat in a nutshell.\n\nThe maps are small and claustrophobic, exploration is limited. Chest have set loot, which is painfully obvious when you have to reload. You'll get the same items from lootables again and again.\n\nThe game has crafting, which by now is very old and tired. Given the limited exploration and the claustrophobic regions, running around trying to find stuff to make stuff is a tedious chore. I wish developers stopped thinking that crafting is the beesknees. It isn't. And in the case of BbF, it's a half-azzed attempt of keeping you in uninteresting regions far longer than the player needs to be. Crafting in BbF is adding a chore to a chore.\n\nI believe that efforts like BbF are outdated. All of this has been before and better. A good thing then that the pricepoint is certainly reasonable. BbF isn't AAA by a long shot and Spiders evidently knows this. For the rest, the game is forgettable but at least by the time you put it down, finished or not, you won't feel robbed.\n\nI don't recommend BbF, but don't let that stop you. Just remember that for me, the only thing I took away from it is the voice-acting of the female Vulcan.","May 9, 2014","false","2.6"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","8","26","0","0"

In prologue everything seems it would be similar - everything is perfect there - the tension, desing, graphic, music, voice of desperate renegade, but after that it goes wrong.\n\n1/3 of the game you spend in a dull jungle/swamp - yes it could be interesting if it would be made more dark/mysterious with cool natives, but here it is just dull - dull quests, dull villagers, the music is still the same, so it starts to be annoying and it just doesn't fit. I tried to continue just to find out that another 1/3 of the game you spend in similar dull city/mountain corridors. I didn't bother to continue...\n\nThere was nothing about the background of the story, no cool places. I would expect more compact story you would uncover about the world around you, but it is not really connected in this world - it is just random names of random groups. The only interesting thing there is your dialogue with the demon inside of you and your decisions about it.\n\nThe reason why Spiders changed the style is in this interview:\nhttp://spiders-devblog.tumblr.com/post/53755625960/check-out-the-interview-of-jehanne-rousseau-ceo\n\nIt seems like they wanted bigger world, but they don't have experience in that - as George Lucas said that to create a fantasy world you need to create all the background so it would looks realistic and you need a lot of ppl and time for that. And that is what this game doesn't have, why the factions and places seems so dull. It is still better to have less but with really well developed background then make it bigger but with no background and fail it in the end.\n\nI guess Spiders are better with narrative games rather then action games - there is quite a lot of them already and they will never be as good as some American companies who don't develop almost anything else.\nIf Spiders would want to get better rating they could change their engine that would allow them to implement better fighting system or better movement - like jump.\n\n\nSo I don't know if I should recommend this game. But it has nice graphic, the idea of the demon is cool and for some players it will be still OK.","December 27, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Mars War logs (same dev) and enjoyed the atmosphere of that game but the combat was a bit messy at times. After a little research it seems war logs players found bound in flame to have a much tigher combat system.  After purchase I am very happy to say I agree. The game is smoother, the skills are more straightforward, the characters are better, the crafting and upgrade systems is much more varied, and it feels a little like the first witcher game.  Combat has consequence though I find myself bruteforcing it from checkpoints sometimes (I wish there was a darksouls checkpoint system instead to force me to learn to fight properly #lazygamer).\n\nOverall I am greatly enjoying this game and it is definitely worth the 10$ I spent on it.  I'd pay for it up to about 25$ and feel satisfied by it so look for it on sale. Happy hunting.","February 1, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I opted to go full demon thinking that would provide me with the most power in the game but all the demon bonus powers are a tradeoff and i didnt find them particularly useful or powerful.

Customization options are offered, but are extremely limited. There are 5 faces and 5 haircuts to choose from, and entering a different name will not change the fact that everybody will still adress you as the default 'Vulcan'. There's also a noticeable difference in the quality of the main character's voice acting, so much so that I decided to play a male character, even though I would have prefered to play as a female warrior, as I usually do.\n\nThe combat is solid and reminds me of Dark Souls in its execution. You slash, block and parry, watching the timing of each one as attacking leaves you vulnerable. It revolves around a system of 3 stances and the proper application of them. Certain enemies need to be met with a sword, while others are more easily dispatched with daggers. The number of potions is limited, so tactics are key. So far, so Dark Souls.\n\nThe third stance is related to the main story arc and contains fire spells, in the usual offensive (Fire Bolt, Fire Blade) and defensive (Fire Shield, Fire AoE) variaties. All of your attacks can be individually upgraded, which, combined with the everchanging teams of enemies facing you, serves to keep combat fresh.\n\nThe boss battles are suitably epic, and also remind me a lot of the ones in Dark Souls. All in all I give it 4 stars. I'd suggest playing it with a controller.\n\nAs a final note for the RPG fans: It is possible to eliminate all the subtitles, combat text and mini-map for a nice immersive experience.","May 30, 2014","true","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A wonderfully high graphics game, with beautiful, rich animations. The characters are a little lacking in devolpment outside the main, and the customization for the main is a little sparse. That all being said, the combat is intense (a little clunky, but if one is adaptive, quite rewarding) the story is rich, character driven, and really fun. As with Mars: War Logs, the crafting system is super thorough, and really fun to use on the large variety of weapons and armour one gets.\nOver all I would say give this game a try, but not when it's full price ;)","June 2, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looked interesting, so I decided to play it.\nI didn't regret it.\n\nYeah, okay, the game looks cheap. It is obvious that the developers had a very small budget to make it, but it is still good. Gameplay is easy to catch but difficult to master (for those of you who will play - daggers for the win, guys, trust me on that!), bosses for the most part are really tough. The game doesn't offer much for those who love complex tactical battles, they are more based on using your reflexes like dodging at the right time and quickly counter-attacking. Still, it adds to the game's dynamics, which is great to my liking)\n\nThe story is rather simple, yet catchy, characters are... well, some of them strongly reminded me of Dragon Age: Origins. For example: early in the game you will find a sex-appealing witch with a lot of attitude. Oh, and you meet her in a middle of a swamp. Pretty much like Morrigan, yeah? And it's not the only example. Oh, and trust me: companions are completely worthless in this game, you'll have to do all the job yourself. The only exception seems to be Sybil who can heal you, the others though... Well, at least you can talk to them.\n\nAll in all, the game is good. Not perfect - good. It is dynamic, rather short (I beat it in 11 hours) to feel boring and it offers some challenge.

This game would be lower on the scale without it's beautiful landscapes and maps with a good interface. The Dialog was okay at times. And the spells seemed to be broken with the upgrade of the fireball that made it go three different ways instead of three in a line doing more damage and being more effective. And not getting health points and magic points every level didn't help with the game, while having two "feats" or skills for health and magic points that only increase your health and magic and total of twenty points.

But picking it up on sale worked out nicely.\n\nI had a few days of fun with this game. Yeah, the writing was inconsistent and the story was tropetastic, but the gameplay wasn't as bad/hard as some have claimed. I think it helped to play a stabby pyro blend instead of warrior, but can't say for sure. What I can say is that combat seemed too easy toward the end (dagger flame on, mash assault, repeat). The twin-boss fight was a bit of a pain, the next two were easy one shots, and the final fight was all about going in with 100 crossbow bolts and 30 healing potions and sprinting in circles ahead of the icy bowling ball salvoes.\n\nI actually (kind of) liked Mars <hurk> War Logs too, which this studio did previously IIRC. Now, /that/ was a game with a miserable combat system. But it did have a certain Total Recall/techno-magey sort of charm to it, and the main (English edition) voice actor did a perfectly respectable job with what he had to work with (I may have played a later redubbed version.)\n\nIf these guys could a) spend ten more minutes brainstorming character and place names, b) tighten up condition checking on the dialogue trees, c) point their script editor to the 20% of lines he seemed to miss on his own pass, and d) fight the urge to keep their male characters swearing like ten-year-old Halo deathmatch players, they would really improve their rep on the story side.

All n' all get this game if it's really cheap, you might like it.","December 3, 2014","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If i see the sequal on Steam for Pre order, by the same devs, i would get it.\n\nThe only thing i wish they did was add More, of Everything! characters, items, chapters, story, demon stages, unique people to MURDER like... the game is not without faults. But the parts of the game that would otherwise shine through most others of this genre, cover up for it's faults.\n\nI highly recomend, and i surely hope We see a bound by flame 2 before too long.\n\n\nRead Below for all the information Steam allows me to say, "Text limit, apperently"\n\n\n\n\nStory: The Story is probably the best part to this game. Play a random dude, who suddenly, by accident, get's this demon living in his head? like, HYPE! Won't spoil much, but, expect a fairly short, sweet little story taking place at the end of all life on the world. More branch off options from the story, in all chapters would have been very good also. Feels like it's Almost a book, with no options to change direction of the story. But, with that, the story itself is still really good, with two equally awesome endings.\n\nGameplay: The fighting itself was surprisingly good, even fairly challenging. There are many ways to go about fighting how you want, and this is important for games like this. Of course, more styles of fighting never hurt, they still did a wonderful job with the boss fights and even encounter to encounter. Never did i feel strong enough to just charge something blindly and kill it. Every fight took at least some thought, or strategy going in.\n\nDialoge: Now, this is an RPG game. there are companions, and chatting. Sure, a lot of it can be skipped, but what fun is that? :D The Dialoge was good. It started off Great. not a lot of boring chatter, but you could still get a grip on what was happening. However, as i got farther into the game. i Noticed less Dialoge. I even went back and talked to Everyone i could to try to find out as much as i could about somone or somthing. Then, game events happen, and it felt like i missed an entire chapter somewhere. Because my character just Had knowledge of somthing. No one told him, not even the demon, he just knew.\n\nSounds/Music: The sounds in the game are very nice. Swords clanging, spells flinging, people nearly dieing, all good. The music on the other hand... the first hour into the game, i thought it was good. Then, i was finally on another chapter, in another location, and the music changed. About half way through the game i had to just mute it. Either to short songs on a to short of a loop, or, something. Also, the music was very peaceful in most cases, which was smoothing, and good... untill you heard some dude horribly humming to it. Got Really Anoyying, Very fast. I often thought if they played the songs, without any human sound effects, it would have been soooo much better.\n\n\nClasses/Customization: The classes ingame are not really Picked when you make your character. Rather, you spend points as you level, where you want. Which is fine and cool. But i found the customization here very limiting. With only three trees and with how short the game was, it was ok. Still had many spells and abilities to have fun with. But i am the type of person, where, if they had, say, 30 different ability trees, it would be good, not great. In games like this i feel there should be no limit to style. Forcing somone into a mage or warrior role should not be a thing, given, many other RPGs try to do the same. However, with that said, it makes since for Bound by Flame to do that, because of the story. Your character is after all, a Mercenary, in a company, of Warriors. being some paladin would not fit in.\n\nComanpions: Now, here is where i think the biggest flaw of the game lies. You get fairly limited amount of Companions, their Following AI is kind of lacking. "They fight well though." Most of them seem to lack depth to me. I cannot go into this without spoiling anything. So, Here we go,\n\n***SPOILERS: I love and i mean Love the fact that at some point, you take over the company. However, this seemed to make Really, like, No impact on Anything... the world is ending, you need every soldier you can, so, let's kill some super strong dude because i Assume the demon within him gave him some kind of lust for blood or power? Like, ok. Was Awesome, but the implications of such were.... empty. I Litterely killed the captian, and talked to Buffalo, and in his dialoge, he talks about how the captain needs to decide what to do and soon because of their situation. Even the Emberblade knight guy had some depth to him... just... no real follow up? Like, his backstory was kind of cool. But it was information that not at even 1 point in the game, mattered. Which is fine, it's a backstory after all.\n\nAs for Sybil though? Does she even have a backstory or was given life by a spell in a library to just read books? Her entire character seems.... lacking... on everything, execpt her heals. Edwen was a cool companion... but you never Learn anything about her. She had attitude, and obviously tried to sway the main character in a direct she thought was best. But, the second you disagree with her she gets mad, tries to get you killed, then, tries to take your power. Like... sounds cool. But, the actuall ness of her being to weak to even fight of the creepy guardian wives, to thinking she can just, kill you and take your power? like... eeehhhhhh ya ok. like, she lose her mind? nothing was really explained about her, no matter how often i tried to talk to her, and Everyone.\n\nThe best companion in my opinion was probably Mathras. He was very unique, and powerful. and seemed to just not care about very much. He was disconnected from the world, had incredible depth, and only saught to see how the events of the main character would turn out. Like, Really cool!\n\nAs for the others, i don't even remember their names. i know there was some whiney elf who just appeared. i don't even remember how i met him, or half the elves for that matter. They just kind of, poof, hi, i shoot a bow. :SPOILERS ***\n\n\n\nSo, now all that is really left is the UI and Crafting system.\n\nUI is short, worked fine, had no issues with it.\n\nCrafting System: Now this is... kind of unique. I like the idea of what was being done here. But i felt it was far to little. I ended the game with so much Crap, i could raise an army. The upgrade only thing was pretty cool. However, i Really feel their needed to A: be WAY more slots to fit to upgrade stuff, or B: capability of Actually making a new item. Simply finding something and adding onto it was really cool just felt like the system was not finished when the game was released. I don't think a crafting system like Skyrim would fit well for this game either, Skyrim's crafting system gave me a headache trying to find all that crap. But, something a little more. I used the same sword for 2 entire chapters until i found something Slightly better, that did not look as cool. Remember, Style matters. :D\n\nOne last thing that could be considered spoilers, ***SPOILERS:\n\nAs the game goes through, your character, as you should know, is bound by flames... a demon lives in his head... and as the game goes on, you have to get more power... and your body starts to... change. You go from some random swordsmand mercenary to, well, a Demon. Fire from the skin, red eyes, huge horns, everything. Of course, it happens over a few chapters not all at once, but, it's still REALLY awesome. I felt like the characters around you would... offer their thoughts on thier leading, very litteraly, turning into a demon. Like, i would have been SO HYPED if the last transmorph gave me wings. like... that would have been... just the best thing... in the entire world of real life.\n\n","August 4, 2014","true","51.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You've been warned.\n\nBound By Flame has a strong "Dragon Age" feel to it, which I enjoyed. But, it started to feel like a clone when I first met one of the characters (Edwen). I was all like "that chick is totally Morrigan. Come to think of it, this other chick is totally Leliana.". This wasn't very far into the game either (when I had this revelation), maybe only 3 hours in.\n\nThe dialogue between the main character and his "companions" (I use the term loosely, as there is no feeling of comradery), is pretty bland, and feels cold and scripted. As a player, I had no emotional investment whatsoever. I found one character's (Mathras) backstory to be interesting, but that was it.\n\nThe party system is misleading, and disappointing. Even though there is constant reference to "companions", your party size is limited to two. Except for that one quest where you get to take two of them with you (what gives?). Issuing commands to your "companion" (because really, only one matters), is pointless. You get to tell them to focus on attack or defense. I had them always on defense, to be a meat shield, otherwise they die too quickly.\n\nThe whole idea of choice is a joke. I only came across three choices that seemed to impact the story, and the game vetoed one of them (pretended like I picked the other one). So really it was only two.\n\nI could go on about how much this game disappointed me (good thing I picked it up on sale), but I will cut myself off here.\n\np.s. I actually enjoyed the game when I wasn't comparing it to similar RPGs.","August 5, 2014","false","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I purchased it I figured it just looked like an average RPG with a somewhat interesting storyline. When i started actually playing the game i realized iw as wrong.\n\nI really enjoyed the combat system in this game, being a bit of a mix of Dark Souls and the Witcher I found it pretty awesome coming from a guy who thoroughly enjoyed both of the games. The way that they set up the storyline is also similar to the witcher in the fact that your decisions will change the outcome of the game and the general layout (act 1/2/3 etc.). However, I would personally say that what you do in this game has more of an effect than what you did in the Witcher. But that is my personal opinion.\n\nI've havent even finished my first play through but im loving the stealth elements already and there are plenty of different ways you can play it. Definitely has re-play potential.","June 29, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started this game on Steam, but then finished it on my XBOX.\n\nPros\n1. Battles good.  They require some thinking and tactics when it comes to some of the larger.  Otherwise, they can just be a typical button pushing battle.\n2. Building your skills into what type of fighter you want to be.  The way you have to switch between the 3 classes depending on what type of creature your going up against is good.\n3. Its not open world, so you can go through it fairly quickly.\n\nCons\n1.  The dialog sounds like it was made by a bunch of teenagers making their first game.  Profanity that seems like it was just put in there for profanity.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm no prude, but it just didn't seem in place.  The accents changed constantly.  There was even one that had a typical "American" southern drawl which made no sense.  It just seems like they didn't put any effort towards the story.\n2.  You can't tell good from bad in your dialog choices.  I thought rescuing a particular person sounded reasonable.  Then she killed someone and everyone hated me.  oops.  Plus they put an achievement to "fall in love" with particular NPC's.  During the entire game, Im trying to figure out how to do this.  Then all of the sudden one of my chioces led to the achievement.  Not sure how I did so don't ask.  Just keep talking to them and keep your fingers crossed.\n3.  The end.........I didn't finish it.   There's no way to "stock up" before the last boss battle.  They take away your only healer.  The people you go in with instantly get taken over by the boss and start fighting on his side.  I tried several combinations, but was never successful.  P.S. I was on Easy mode.\n\nSo, my final recommendation is turn off the subtitles, turn the volumn down.  Stock up well before the boss battle.  And when you get to the boss battle, trade it in for a much better game.","June 22, 2014","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the game surprised me.\n\nFrom looking at the screenshots a lone it looked very... ' cinematic '. Like the main highlights of this game may be just cutscenes. I figured the gameplay would be overdone and too showy like Assassin's Creed's ( just as an example, not hating on it. )\n\nBut the good graphics kind of threw me off. Rarely is a game blessed with good graphics with a comfortable and simple gameplay.\n\nThe user interface is simplistic, easy to use, and not at all complicated. Pretty straight forward.\n\nI've only played for a hour or so, and so far the only thing I can say negative about this game is that the Voice Acting while not terrible, is a bit lacking. ( I'm just picky with those things. )\nThe use of swearing to add either grittiness or to add some form of crude humor seems a little uneeded. But I guess at times I did have a little chuckle.\n\nAlso the lore is kind of not explained to you, one of those cases where they throw you in the middle of a new world and you're just suppose to pick up on stuff. Not much is explained to you about it, though you can talk to characters and learn more.\nWhich brings me to my next part, the characters are all designed pretty well. Unique with distinguishable personalities.\nThe dialogue reminds me alot of Mass Effect or Dragon's Age. Which I'm quite fond of.\n\nOverall I give this game a 8.0 / 10\n\nThe game is nice, especially if you're a fan of such games like The Elder Scrolls or Bioware's Dragon Age.\nMy only gripes as I said was the lack of info on lore ( I'm a lore nut. )\nAnd the somewhat scrambled voice acting.\nOther than that, It's a great game.\n\nCo Op would be great though!","June 21, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the game surprised me.\n\nFrom looking at the screenshots a lone it looked very... ' cinematic '. Like the main highlights of this game may be just cutscenes. I figured the gameplay would be overdone and too showy like Assassin's Creed's ( just as an example, not hating on it. )\n\nBut the good graphics kind of threw me off. Rarely is a game blessed with good graphics with a comfortable and simple gameplay.\n\nThe user interface is simplistic, easy to use, and not at all complicated. Pretty straight forward.\n\nI've only played for a hour or so, and so far the only thing I can say negative about this game is that the Voice Acting while not terrible, is a bit lacking. ( I'm just picky with those things. )\nThe use of swearing to add either grittiness or to add some form of crude humor seems a little uneeded. But I guess at times I did have a little chuckle.\n\nAlso the lore is kind of not explained to you, one of those cases where they throw you in the middle of a new world and you're just suppose to pick up on stuff. Not much is explained to you about it, though you can talk to characters and learn more.\nWhich brings me to my next part, the characters are all designed pretty well. Unique with distinguishable personalities.\nThe dialogue reminds me alot of Mass Effect or Dragon's Age. Which I'm quite fond of.\n\nOverall I give this game a 8.0 / 10\n\nThe game is nice, especially if you're a fan of such games like The Elder Scrolls or Bioware's Dragon Age.\nMy only gripes as I said was the lack of info on lore ( I'm a lore nut. )\nAnd the somewhat scrambled voice acting.\nOther than that, It's a great game.\n\nCo Op would be great though!","June 21, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Humanity is almost wiped out and are pretty much fighting a losing battle. There isn't any time for a slow build up like other games where usually the antagonist isn't known yet. It's kind of an apocalypse/end of days setting with just the remnants of humanity left. It would be like starting mass effect 3 at the story starting point without having played the first 2.\n\nI think alot of people don't get the combat, you can't just wade in to a group and button mash, archers need to be taken out first for example and it's also essential to learn how to parry/riposte or dodge, you can't face tank and expect to get anywhere in the game. You can die in like 3-4 hits but most enemies are slow and you learn their sequences. It's pretty much like the witcher combat, which people also complained about because they couldn't just hit attack all the time. There's a learning curve and I think it's decently challenging and not bad.\n\nIf you go full warrior spec. you will find it underwhelming and they aren't comparable to the mage spec. Most effective playstyle was to stay in ranger stance so you can dodge and put points into the mage tree, upgraded you fire 4 fireballs at once. Also the first tier of the ranger tree you can sprint in combat so yeah sprinting around in combat behind slow moving targets and firing off a cluster of fireballs at point blank range makes the fights actually pretty easy. There was only one fight with 2 concubines that took a few goes.\n\nMercenaries are not that helpful admittedly in combat, it's best to just take sybil except for when you need to take someone else and put her in defense mode. She will be a decoy for some mobs in group combat and will heal unless she is being pinned down and will heal post battle saving a need for pots or downtime for health regen. There isn't any type of way to augment your mercenaries so I don't know how they scale.\n\nI thought the graphics looked pretty good played out at max, the player model especially when it's turned fully demon looks very sharp. It has a really great soundtrack which I thought added alot to the immersion of the game.\n\nThe voice acting/dialogue is passable for a budget game, there are dialogue choices which can have an impact on your mercenaries though there isn't much depth to it as you end up at the same point in the end.\n\nLike any RPG you can augment your gear which will depend more on what style you are playing, it's fairly basic and the crafting system is not complex.\n\nThe game is around 15 hours doing every quest and You will want to play it through twice if you want to experience other playstyles and see alternate dialogue choice endings.\n\nI don't think this game ever tried to pass itself off as a AAA game with a huge studio and multimillion dollar budget. I didn't expect any more as I paid $35 for this game new which is almost 1/3 the price of any other new game where I live.\n\nit's not perfect but I think it is still an ok game of a 6 or 7 rating and the bound by flame universe is interesting enough if they expanded on it more that I still enjoyed this game enough to buy any dlc/sequel","May 10, 2014","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you accept it's increasing possession of you, how will that play out with your companions, will its extended powers help you or hinder you. Sometimes the obvious choice is not the right one...or is it.\n\nNot being quite sure makes the story engaging and makes a replay inevitable.\n\nCombat is very good, you can become a master of all trades to a certain extent, with Warrior/Rogue and Fire Mage powers available to you and use all the powers in succession, eg. Stealth into battle, Kill some mobs, then apply fire to your 2 hand sword, throw fireballs, send out a wall of fire to push enemies away from you etc.\n\nCombat is also done in the presence of companions, you can have one at a time from a stable of 4 or 5, they each have their own abilities, like, Mage, Ranger, Warrior, Healer, They are not great but they do keep enemies occupied while you take care of business.\n\nBosses are VERY impressive for the budget scale of the game, in size, design and combat ability.\n\nThere are plenty of quests, none of which will keep you too engrossed, but they serve their purpose.\n\nMy main gripe with the game so far is the quest system (but only a slight gripe). Some times you will fail a quest because you haven't read the fine print, eg. you may do a quest and get XP for the different components of it, but see a RED X beside something and find that you should have done the quest in the presence of a certain NPC, or events in the game may over take your quest progress and you may not be able to hand it in because the quest giver has died, but pretty much small potatoes and stuff for your subsequent playthrough.","April 25, 2015","true","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jetan/recommended/243930/","jetan","Jetan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jetan/","408 products in account","Oh man, where to start?\n\nI've been playing Bound by Flame for about 2 and a half hours now, ensuring to compelte all of the sidequests that I could and all of the main quests that I could. I've made it to the first village, I'm level 12 now and have most of the sidequests in that village completed. So let's talk about the game itself before I give you my thumbs up or down. If you're just looking for a summary, head to the very bottom and I'll let you know what I think in a condensed format.\n\nGameplay:\nCombat\nBound by Flame is a combat game that tries to liken itself to the Fable series while also maintaining a bit of realism to it. You may be wondering if this is a good or bad thing. Well that's just it, I'm not sure either. I'm playing on the Normal difficulty level and find it EXTREMELY challenging. Maybe I'm just bad with the blocking or maybe other games have conditioned me to always expect a "Dodge" mechanic rather than a "Block" mechanic. The enemies tend to cause a LOT of damage to you and it can be kind of frustrating the first few times you witness your health bar go from half to empty in two seconds. This is probably where I'd say the game shines though. In the same vein that Dark Souls was made to be challenging, Bound by Flame has the same concept of challenge too it without overstepping its boundaries. It teaches you that you shouldn't just rush headlong into a confrontation and that's a good thing.\n\nThere are multiple stances you can use in combat, I have four unlocked so far. These are: Warrior, Ranger, Stealth and Pyromancy. The Warrior stance is just like it sounds: Wield a two-handed weapon and charge into the fray. The Ranger stance dual-wields daggers and is focused on dodging attacks and positioning rather than outright tanking. Stealth... Well this is where the combat mechanics fail in my opinion: Stealth seems rather useless if you don't pour points into it in the beginning. You can get a critical bonus from sneaking up on enemies, but only if you're not noticed and the enemies in the early game all tend to clump together which makes this impossible. Pyromancy I found to be fun, fire orbs, fire weapons and the general feel of spells that you would think you would get from the title.\n\nThere are also traps you can set up to make fights easier and let me tell you: I'm one of those guys who hordes his items and never uses them in the irratioonal fear that some situation could come up that I might need X items even though I could definitely use their help right then and there. I was taught how to create some simple exploding traps at the beginning of the game and immediately thought to myself how I would NEVER use them. Well, the game itself proved me wrong. The difficulty of some of the random encounters had me circling around trees at half health, setting these traps in order to kill my enemies or greatly weaken them so I could win the fight.\n\nCombat: 7/10\nPros:\n-Challenging\nCons:\n-Hard to get the hang of at first.\n\nCustomization\nA key point in the game that I saw was that it let you customize your character beyond just what armor you equipped. Each armor and weapon I found had slots for additional add-ons to be set in to the piece. Each of these add-ons provided different bonuses (i.e. resistance to poison, extra damage) as well as customized the look of your weapon or armor. I feel that if I played on a higher difficulty level I would absolutely HAVE to use the right customization options to prevail as even on the normal difficulty I was struggling with random encounters.\n\nCustomization: 8/10\nPros\n-Extensive, allows you to prepare for any situation\nCons\n-The depth of it will intimidate the average video gamer.\n\nCompanions\nOh man, this is the part I was excited about too. I've unlocked one single companion this far and I've had her pretty much since the get-go. At first I thought I would get a stronger level of customization with her (I.e talent trees) but was disappointed when I found out I could only influence her actions in combat. Also when out of combat I could tell her to be more offensive or defensive in our next fights. After being spoiled by games like "Mass Effect" which allowed me to form strong bonds with my allies, I feel like this was a huge letdown in that regard. I might as well have been carting around "Nameless Mage" with me through the swamps rather than "Sybil." You have the option of talking to them out of combat to discover more about them and they'll occasionally pipe up with opinions as you go about doing sidequests or fighting... But I kept asking myself the same question: What's the point? Not every game needs a romantic sidequest sure but I really feel let down by how shallow this feels. On top of that they aren't even too strong in combat. Like I said that the monsters are strong enough to kill you rather quickly if you aren't paying attention, my ally was content to stay in the back and shoot fireballs, occasionally heal me and facetank the mobs to her hearts content. She spent more time on the floor rather than not. At least a level-up option would have made this feature so much better.\n\nCompanions: 5/10\nPros\n-Someone to facetank the mobs\nCons\n-Lacks depth\n-No real reason to care for your allies.\n\nStory\nAs a fan of story-telling in games I feel there was a strong attempt to make something very interesting happen here and I hate to pass judgement when I'm still so early on in the story. But so far I'm not really drawn in to care too much. It's the standard undead horde versus humans and elves storyline that I've seen a while. The demon presence in you seems to be the main focal point of the story but nothing exciting had happened with it in the two hours and thirty minutes of my playtime. I feel like it could possibly evolve into something better but at the same time I feel like it could fall flat on its face.\n\nStory\nPros\n-It's not Call of Duty\nCons\n-Seemingly can not find a single ♥♥♥♥ to give.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, the combat is fun and challenging. The customization system has a great amount of depth too it. The companions fall short and it's too early in the game to condemn the story just yet (Though it seems likely to fall on its face). If you're looking for a challenging strategic-action game with Fable-like mechanics, you'll find it here. It's not worth a 60$ price tag for sure and you're better off paying at most: 40$ for it. So if you're just not straight up itching to play this game (In which case you probably already bought it) I'd wait for it go on sale at one point then get it.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\nPros\n-It's challenging\n-Customization!\n-Combat is actually kind of enjoyable\nCons\n-Companion system fell short of expectations. Don't expect to form Mass Effect style bonds with your companions.\n-Story is kind of eh this short into the game.\n-It'll intimidate your average gamer with the customization depth.","May 28, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Customization options are offered, but are extremely limited. There are 5 faces and 5 haircuts to choose from, and entering a different name will not change the fact that everybody will still adress you as the default 'Vulcan'. There's also a noticeable difference in the quality of the main character's voice acting, so much so that I decided to play a male character, even though I would have prefered to play as a female warrior, as I usually do.\n\nThe combat is solid and reminds me of Dark Souls in its execution. You slash, block and parry, watching the timing of each one as attacking leaves you vulnerable. It revolves around a system of 3 stances and the proper application of them. Certain enemies need to be met with a sword, while others are more easily dispatched with daggers. The number of potions is limited, so tactics are key. So far, so Dark Souls.\n\nThe third stance is related to the main story arc and contains fire spells, in the usual offensive (Fire Bolt, Fire Blade) and defensive (Fire Shield, Fire AoE) variaties. All of your attacks can be individually upgraded, which, combined with the everchanging teams of enemies facing you, serves to keep combat fresh.\n\nThe boss battles are suitably epic, and also remind me a lot of the ones in Dark Souls. All in all I give it 4 stars. I'd suggest playing it with a controller.\n\nAs a final note for the RPG fans: It is possible to eliminate all the subtitles, combat text and mini-map for a nice immersive experience.","May 30, 2014","true","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're expecting thet it delivers the same ammount of quality and polish you're probably going to be disappointed when you start to play it. I am a hardcore RPG fan so for me it was an awesome game, I found myself wanting more after I finished the game. (btw ignore my play time I fell asleep and left my pc on).\nI also recommend playing this with a controler, it works fine with mouse and keyboard but you'll see notice that it's easier with it.\n\nNow some tips I will give you that you'll find usefull...\nNEVER buy stuff from stores, it's a waste of money if you look around you find good gear just lying around so don't do that. Stores are god to sell some of the stuff you don't use anymore but that's about it.\nIf you need crafting materials you can also recycle the gear you don't use anymore to get some stuff from those.\nTraps are not just extras in this game at times they are incredibly usefull and can save your liffe.\n\nAs for the length of the game...\nThe game took me about 15 hours or more to complete and I tried to do everything in the game. I think I did miss on 1 or 2 sidequests but I doubt it. I really squeezed this game dry, if you pay attention to the dialog and don't just skip it you'll find that the story and lore are actually kind of interesting. Now let me start with this review and list the pros and cons...\n\n+Ability to choose your gender and somewhat customize your appearance not extensively but still much appreciated.\n+Graphically beautiful for a game that hasn't got that big of a budget, just take a while to look around and take it all in.\n+Great music, especially during epic scenes and moments (composed by Olivier Derivière) I found myself just stopping to wait and listen to it sometimes.\n+Well designed skill trees giving you usefull options and upgrades to further develop your character.\n+Challenging combat that lets you think instead of just being able to annihilate everything in sight in a few seconds.\n+Crafting system that let's you improve everything you can wear and lets you craft cosumables as well (armor, boots, gloves, weapons, potions, crosbow bolts, traps)\n+Impactfull and story branching choices are present and well executed, this adds great replayability to the game.\n+Interesting companions with their own backstory and personality with romance options included as well.\n+Great armor and weapon variety which can both be customized and improved by the crafting system.\n+Well told story of a world that is on the brink of destruction.\n+Fair ammount of sidequests to further explore the world and keep you going.\n+The demon dilemma is well done and the dialog between Vulcan (the player) and the demon is fun and interesting.\n\n-The voice acting is a mixed bag, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not so good. (if you have played the witcher 1 you should know the dialog and lip syncing in this game is similar, a bit stiff and unpolished but not horrible)\n-INCREDIBLY hard final boss battle (I'm not joking go into the final battle with A LOT of potions it's hard both on easy and mormal) there is an awesome song during the combat though...\n-Rather abrupt ending without a nice closing scene to let you feel satisfied by what you have accomplished.\n-Sometimes quests make you backtrack a lot and can begin to frustrate you a bit.\n-Enemies respawn annoyingly fast in some spots.\n-Companions aren't much help in combat except for 2 or 3 of them that have usefull skills that help you in battle.\n\nAll in all I think this game is pretty good, it's not perfect but I found myself wanting for more by the end of it.\nI think the universe and the new world here presented by Spiders has a ton of potential if they decide to take it further. I hope more people help this small company grow. I strangly recommend it to RPG fans, this is pretty much a must have if you are one IMO.\n\nI give this game a 9/10, if not for some of it's rather unpolished aspects it would be a 10 for sure.\nI do recommend everyone that is about to play it or is playing it to do as many sidequests as possible, trust me you need the experience. At the end of the game it gets hard. I put my points into the warrior and pyromancer skill trees and had a lot of trouble with the final boss. (possibly because I went into it without potions but still...)\nOh and this is not a game for casual players, I'm sure they would quickly get annoyed and frustrated by it.\nAnd for the love of God please stop comparing it to triple A titles it's just unfair to the game and it's developers.\nI hope you find my review helpfull, it's the first one for me...","May 11, 2014","true","92.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/recommended/243930/","Kreegath","Kreegath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/","227 products in account","I would not recommend "Bound by Flame" to you unless you're both a real avid fan of the action RPG genre and you've played the multitude of other, better, games available to you. You might get some enjoyment out of it, but be aware beforehand that the game is riddled with problems, limitations and questionable design decisions.\n\nFirstly, I did find the lore to be engaging. You kept getting glimpses of some very interesting story elements, enough to keep atleast myself hooked until the ending, which then kind of dropped the ball and fizzled out into unsatisfaction. Given that the game studio is both new and small, perhaps you can't expect a perfect product, granted. However, as a gamer, it's still a disappointing experience to sit through, regardless.\n\nThe game is not built around the lore, however, but rather the combat system. It's no saving grace, sadly, as you'll quickly discover it to be as simplistic and clunky as the story. To clarify: the idea behind the combat system is great, but the execution is not.\nLike many other action RPG's you'll be expected to fight in a block/dodge-counterattack style, or run and gun with your crossbow and magic. Some enemies will be blocking your attacks themselves, and others will have attacks that need to either be blocked, dodged or interrupted, so you are meant to switch styles on-the-fly. In actuality you don't need to. You will never want to use your blocking and interrupting stance, ever, but solely rely on dodging and interrupting your enemies with the fast attack weaponry. This is because when you fight more than one enemy at the same time, your attack animation for the blocking stance is much, much too slow to ever get a swing off between enemy attacks. Your fast attacks in the dodge stance will always end up doing more damage, faster, simply because your attack animation is that much shorter. That's not to say you HAVE to play with just the daggers, but playing according to the developer's intention WILL frustrate you to no end, for no upside what-so-ever.\nAnother problem with "Bound by Flame" is that the controls are unforgivingly clunky for being the main focus of the game. Sometimes your character just will not dodge when you desperately spam the dodge button. Sometimes your character does dodge, but automatically counter-attacks in an attack animation that you cannot interrupt or dodge out of until it's done, which can (and will) spell out your doom when you meet attack combinations that *require* two consecutive dodges.\nThe camera also proves to be problematic, as fighting in small spaces often leads to walls or other doodads getting in the way of your line of sight, and I need not reiterate the need for visuals in a game where your mode of fighting is twitch-based dodge and counterattacks. It's enough to ruin more than one fight every playthrough, which in this day and age is completely unnecessary in my opinion.\n\nThere's also something to be said for the art direction, as you will be fighting two things throughout the game. The first being undead, primarily zombies, and the second being insects. It gets very boring, very fast. Zombies and insects are easy, starting enemies you have to plough through in most RPG's early in order to get to the good parts; only in this game it ends before actually getting to that good part. The bosses are just the same way, where they look and feel like regular enemies as you get bored after the first time you beat them. Perhaps *something* other than slow zombies would've livened the game up somewhat. Slow zombies are not scary, they're not imposing and they're not dangerous. Neither are insects.\n\nThe side characters were unengaging, flat and one-dimensional. Your standard, garden variety, fantasy stereotypes.\nAs with Skyrim, you have just about no interaction with them throughout the game, no fluff dialogues to establish any personality, no discernable effect in combat whatsoever, the most bland and formulaic personal quests as well as so called "romance quests", that are no more than you picking the dialogue option that suits that character, then choose them for a quest and then get a short cutscene. Coming from someone who's played games that did side characters right, like the Baldur's Gate-, Dragon Age- and Mass Effect series, the lack of effort and thought put into it in "Bound by Flame" really shines through. I've played through the game four times and I don't even know any of their personalities; being as bland and vanilla as they are. There's just no interaction whatsoever, nothing to latch onto. They tried giving some of the side characters some gimmick, like the swordsman who refers to people in the third person, but with zero interaction with him apart from the one personal quest per chapter, he's just another body in a collection of bodies.\n\nThe voice acting is poor, very unengaged, detached, flat and dry. This is extremely disappointing as the main male lead is voiced by the amazingly talented Robin Atkin Downes, of Babylon 5 fame. It's not appropriate to the actions taking place on the screen, with every line coming out like it was read aloud from a sheet of paper with no context. Inflections, tone and timber feels off throughout, and almost never reflecting the emotions that the game tells us the characters are currently feeling.\nA prime example being a girl who lost her father and apparently feels cold, her heart hardened by the loss and her determination hard as steel. However, neither her voice acting nor dialogue lines never, ever, changes one iota from before her loss to after. In a voice acted RPG, this cannot be done so shoddily, it just doesn't lend to a good player experience.\n\nFinally, I have to mention the uncanny valley-effect while watching the cutscenes. The characters don't look at each other, or the camera is pointed so it appears like they're not looking at each other, not making eye contact and not syncing the lip movement to what is spoken. They're also not standing naturally in relation with each other, sometimes standing with a huge space between each other and sometimes right up in each other's faces, not making eye contact of course. It's instantly noticable and very distracting in my opinion.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would not recommend "Bound by Flame", as it tries to do what other games in the genre does, only it never really gets it right or well enough to be passable.\nAn RPG is built on setting, story and characters, and "Bound by Flame" fails to deliver an engaging story with interesting characters in an immersive setting.\nAn action RPG is built on a good fighting system and tight controls, and "Bound by Flame" fails to deliver either, as the fighting system is heavily biased to one path and the controls are sluggish and unresponsive.\nA lacking player experience, with an annoying camera, uninvolved voice acting and poorly produced cutscenes, cements the foundation of my recommendation for you to NOT get this game for anything less than a "75% off" deal, and only then if you're a fan of the genre. There are better games like "Bound by Flame" out there, better games on Steam even. Instead, play the Assassin's Creed series, the Mass Effect series, the Baldur's Gate series, the Dark Souls series, Darksiders, Bastion or even Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.","May 26, 2014","false","41.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every mob gives you subtle clues that show you how to respond, and you can literally fight an entire boss fight not getting hit if you are smart, quick, and capable of reading the enemy's signals for one type of attack or another. Yes, I've died probably 80 times so far, but you can save whenever you want, and you can always do it better.

Seeing as the complaints about both games are very much similar (dated graphics, clunky controls), I thought I should give this one a try as well because I was sure I was going to enjoy it just as much. I knew it didn't have a long story, I was fine with that. I was even fine with the flat characters and the horrible, horrible voice acting. Not much difference from Mars: War Logs, but in a solid game, that wouldn't be a reason to complain. It's not Square Enix or Bethesda after all.\n\nI did not enjoy it. Ignoring the blatant problems with voice acting and a rushed storyline (I was really confused about a lot of thing up until the middle of Act 2 and suddenly, everything happened at once?). I dragged myself further, trying to ignore my problems with the game, but it really was just that - a drag.\n\nWhile the story seems rushed after completing about 50% of the game, the combat is the real issue at hand. I'm not sure if it's a problem with keyboard/mouse controls, but what I experienced was a very unresponsive protagonist. Sometimes, you would get surprise attacked without having your swords or daggers pulled and thus just have to deal with a devastating first blow. Sometimes, the character simply wouldn't do what I was telling her to do. She wouldn't block or parry, wouldn't attack when I saw an opening in the enemy's defense. The unresponsive controls made the combat even less enjoyable than it already is.\n\nDifficulty in combat mostly comes from the enemy's high HP pool and often bigger groups of enemies in small, confined areas that are hard to navigate (especially due to a wonky camera that doesn't exactly appreciate narrow areas with lots of different obstacles) vs. your own very low damage output. At several points, I thought throwing rocks at my enemy would have been just as useful. This kind of difficulty quickly turns into frustration, which, in my case, also leads to me being less willing to actually try my best in combat. That's a vicious circle, really.\n\nA lot of people have written that the combat is fluid, but I can't agree to that. I don't know if it's a problem with keyboard/mouse or my system, but even changing stance in combat simply didn't happen fast enough to avoid getting hit, being cornered and killed in a matter of seconds (especially with bigger enemy groups that will all rush at you if they see you on the ground - normally a reason for praise!). To me, it really was clunky, unresponsive, unbalanced and unrewarding. Defeating an enemy didn't give me the feeling of "Ha, I finally killed ya!", but more a feeling of "Thank god it's over, can we please move on now?"\n\nMoving on is another thing. Cutscenes happen at the most haphazard times or so it feels. Your companions will (seemingly) randomly stop and tell you their entire life story in one go. I don't mind finding out about the companions, quite the opposite, but even those dialogues felt like a drag, especially with the questionable writing and bad voice acting.\n\nNow, I won't get into details about the graphics. They're not 2014 by any standards, but they're not horrible as so many people claim they are. I think they're okay, especially keeping in mind that Bound by Flame was made with a low budget. The lighting is beautiful, but there isn't a lot of variation in areas and seeing the same ice barrier for the umpteenth time in a long, narrow corridor isn't blowing my mind. But really, the graphics and the design are okay (except for Edwen's wardrobe malfunction which doesn't bother me because of nudity, but because of the absolute impossibility of her dress staying where it's supposed to be).\n\nVoice acting was bad. Really bad. There is nothing redeeming about it, the voices all sound bland and devoid of emotions which is really sad. The writing wouldn't seem half as bad if the voice acting had been done right and you would feel some sort of emotion, so you'd feel connected to the characters. As it is, that never happened. I found the protagonist and almost all companions except Mathras to be highly unlikeable.\n\nThe story again was okay. It's nothing groundbreakingly new, it's not super exciting, but it gets the point across. It would have been even better if it had unravelled a little more quickly during the first half of the game and a little more slowly towards the end. Balance is the key here, but the way Bound by Flame presents its story now feels rushed and very hectic.\n\nIn general, only looking at soundtrack, graphics and story, it would have been an okay game. I would have given it something like 7/10. But the awful combat and controls combined with the horrible voice acting drag it down. Seeing as gameplay is vital and a clunky game simply isn't fun to me, I'll give it a 3/10. I know where it was trying to borrow from, it tried really hard too, but it ultimately failed. Now, I tried really hard to like this game, to ignore the problems with the controls, but I can't. My final advice is: don't buy this game, it's not worth the 20 bucks at all.","June 27, 2014","false","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though the game has challenging combat and a lot of potential, it fails to live to the expectations of most players that were hyped for it.\n\nPros\n- Baddass character\n- Different ways to approach combat.\n- Replayability value, because the player can build the character in 3 different ways and the dialogue choices made affect the story.\n\nCons\n- Graphics are not always the same quality. Some areas look better than others.\n- The controls and framerate are often unstable and hard to manage, thus making a hardcore game, unplayable at times.\n- There are not that many different mobs.\n- The game is not very noob friendly and the developers intended it to be that way. So if you are not a player who likes to get killed a lot during progression, you may end up frustrated at times.\n- The customisation options are there, but they are not that impactful towards the actual combat. Meaning if you know how to hit and block/dodge, you can get away with whatever build path you decide to go for. Also, build paths are unbalanced so you are better off going for one, rather than the other two or all three.\n- The companions of the game, which are supposed to be there to support you, stay dead for the whole duration of a battle and then get up afterwards.\n- There no combos of any sort, only strategy. So whether you approach the battle one way or another, you are gonna be using the same 3 slashes on a mob for about 40 secs, until you kill it.\n\nIn the end, if this type of game genre is not your favourite, I don't recommend this game. Meaning this game can still be fun for the harcore rpg fans, if you can look past all the flaws.\nBound by flame had the potential to be a good game, but it failed to deliver.\n","May 10, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like many have said, you hit the enemy and there's not much else to it. The health bar decreases and you move on to the next enemy.\n\nThe targetting systems is old. Press "R" to target and flick your mouse-wheel up or down to change targets. I remember that from "Advent Rising" and even then I hated using it. It's not a bad system, but a little more intelligent optimization of the engine may have made targetting more intuitive.\n\nVoice acting is very emotionless in most cases but very over-the-top in others. Talk to Mason if you want to know what I mean.  The voice actors they chose for the male and female characters simply don't match the character models, but that's a personal opinion.\n\nDespite some of those very small issues, I am still having fun!  The story so far is great and the characters are interesting.  I try not to compare one game as a whole to another game.

I am about as far as the 7th screen shot on steam currently, not too far into the first true chapter.\n\nSo Bound by flame is definitley not blockbuster of the year. But it, so me, is still a great idea of a game. If you are looking for another Dark souls, Dragon age 2, Witcher video game, look no further. Now the storyline is your typical RPG. World is being ravaged by frost demons, your a merc, get partially possessed by a fire demon, meet allies along the way to do various things, heal, archery, so forth. You set out to save your world, now I haven't got far enough for the demon possession yet, see if the storyline changes or what not, but that ties into the skills. Now the 3 you have, is Warrior, two handed weapon, heavy damage, block, parry/counter attack, and stun with a kick. Ranger, dual wield daggers, parry/counter, i think, played mostly warrior, and dodge, wish warrior had dodge.IT IS SLOW to switch stances by the way. No quick on the fly. Last is Fire Magic. Which you can use in both your stances, light your blades on fire, fireballs, so forth. The skill tree in my opinion, as fast as I have been leveling is small. Not terrible added with Crafting. As well as traps and a crossbow for non magic long range, not skills. There are also perks, you unlock by doing things. For instance getting more health, just drink 5 potions, and unlock the perk with a point. Experience, magicka, weapons, everything almost has a perk. THE KEY to combat in this game is BLOCK TIMING. I cannot stress this enough. It is learning the enemy moves, and knowing when to parry. Combat is fun, but if using only one skill set, becomes repetitive, but this early for me isn't bad since im still trying to learn the timing, and I keep dying, its a nice challenge without being too much like DS. It feels good to start demolishing a foe with ease when you know its moves. Then a new one comes along. All the regular enemies have different attack styles. And the 2 bosses I have fought, one being huge, attack its armour while fending off its lackeys, and besides its almost one hit kills, is fairly easy. The 2nd in the 7th screen shot on steam so far, "SPOILERS" Is all by his lonesome, but has a high health bar, few attacks, but they hit fairly hard, but are fairly easy to counter once learned, and its defense attack where he springs spikes out of the ground, can quickly kill you if you get caught in a pinball machince effect with it, and is not as easy to defend from, for if you can't dodge because your not in Ranger mode, you can't just block as a warrior. Now with that, the crafting, COLLECT EVERYTHING! Almost every enemy drops some kind of loot, or money, and sometimes items, along with coming across a rock you can search and barrels and crates, SEARCH IT ALL, GET IT ALL. "SPOILERS" The barrells can be like chest mimics, they look like womens privates. ""So CRAFTING uses all you find, gold can be used within your menu to buy items you find for the basics, and then the basics make the higher tier regeants. So no needing to always stop by a town, even potions can be made on the go. So with the regeants in check, you can make armor and weapon mods, on the go. The higher the weapon and armor, the more mods available to make, from resistances, to more power, or speed, so on and so forth. Which is why with this added to the perks and the skills, its balances nicely for now. This is not the best game I have ever played, nor is it amazing, maybe great or good, and ok, lacking in some areas. Dialouge could be better, talking to someone and being in a cinematic view is ok, but then your still talking to the peson, and even though it looks like you can move, you can only move your camera angle. Small things like that. On a 1-10 system, a 7. I will update when I get there. Hopefully this lets you know what your getting into, and wether you want to pay the $40 for an indie developer, who is actually pretty good. If this game came out 2 years ago now, say around DA2, then it actually might be amazing, especially from an indie developer, now with the new consoles, new games, it still holds its own to me without falling through the cracks.","May 9, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/recommended/243930/","Kreegath","Kreegath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/","227 products in account","I would not recommend "Bound by Flame" to you unless you're both a real avid fan of the action RPG genre and you've played the multitude of other, better, games available to you. You might get some enjoyment out of it, but be aware beforehand that the game is riddled with problems, limitations and questionable design decisions.\n\nFirstly, I did find the lore to be engaging. You kept getting glimpses of some very interesting story elements, enough to keep atleast myself hooked until the ending, which then kind of dropped the ball and fizzled out into unsatisfaction. Given that the game studio is both new and small, perhaps you can't expect a perfect product, granted. However, as a gamer, it's still a disappointing experience to sit through, regardless.\n\nThe game is not built around the lore, however, but rather the combat system. It's no saving grace, sadly, as you'll quickly discover it to be as simplistic and clunky as the story. To clarify: the idea behind the combat system is great, but the execution is not.\nLike many other action RPG's you'll be expected to fight in a block/dodge-counterattack style, or run and gun with your crossbow and magic. Some enemies will be blocking your attacks themselves, and others will have attacks that need to either be blocked, dodged or interrupted, so you are meant to switch styles on-the-fly. In actuality you don't need to. You will never want to use your blocking and interrupting stance, ever, but solely rely on dodging and interrupting your enemies with the fast attack weaponry. This is because when you fight more than one enemy at the same time, your attack animation for the blocking stance is much, much too slow to ever get a swing off between enemy attacks. Your fast attacks in the dodge stance will always end up doing more damage, faster, simply because your attack animation is that much shorter. That's not to say you HAVE to play with just the daggers, but playing according to the developer's intention WILL frustrate you to no end, for no upside what-so-ever.\nAnother problem with "Bound by Flame" is that the controls are unforgivingly clunky for being the main focus of the game. Sometimes your character just will not dodge when you desperately spam the dodge button. Sometimes your character does dodge, but automatically counter-attacks in an attack animation that you cannot interrupt or dodge out of until it's done, which can (and will) spell out your doom when you meet attack combinations that *require* two consecutive dodges.\nThe camera also proves to be problematic, as fighting in small spaces often leads to walls or other doodads getting in the way of your line of sight, and I need not reiterate the need for visuals in a game where your mode of fighting is twitch-based dodge and counterattacks. It's enough to ruin more than one fight every playthrough, which in this day and age is completely unnecessary in my opinion.\n\nThere's also something to be said for the art direction, as you will be fighting two things throughout the game. The first being undead, primarily zombies, and the second being insects. It gets very boring, very fast. Zombies and insects are easy, starting enemies you have to plough through in most RPG's early in order to get to the good parts; only in this game it ends before actually getting to that good part. The bosses are just the same way, where they look and feel like regular enemies as you get bored after the first time you beat them. Perhaps *something* other than slow zombies would've livened the game up somewhat. Slow zombies are not scary, they're not imposing and they're not dangerous. Neither are insects.\n\nThe side characters were unengaging, flat and one-dimensional. Your standard, garden variety, fantasy stereotypes.\nAs with Skyrim, you have just about no interaction with them throughout the game, no fluff dialogues to establish any personality, no discernable effect in combat whatsoever, the most bland and formulaic personal quests as well as so called "romance quests", that are no more than you picking the dialogue option that suits that character, then choose them for a quest and then get a short cutscene. Coming from someone who's played games that did side characters right, like the Baldur's Gate-, Dragon Age- and Mass Effect series, the lack of effort and thought put into it in "Bound by Flame" really shines through. I've played through the game four times and I don't even know any of their personalities; being as bland and vanilla as they are. There's just no interaction whatsoever, nothing to latch onto. They tried giving some of the side characters some gimmick, like the swordsman who refers to people in the third person, but with zero interaction with him apart from the one personal quest per chapter, he's just another body in a collection of bodies.\n\nThe voice acting is poor, very unengaged, detached, flat and dry. This is extremely disappointing as the main male lead is voiced by the amazingly talented Robin Atkin Downes, of Babylon 5 fame. It's not appropriate to the actions taking place on the screen, with every line coming out like it was read aloud from a sheet of paper with no context. Inflections, tone and timber feels off throughout, and almost never reflecting the emotions that the game tells us the characters are currently feeling.\nA prime example being a girl who lost her father and apparently feels cold, her heart hardened by the loss and her determination hard as steel. However, neither her voice acting nor dialogue lines never, ever, changes one iota from before her loss to after. In a voice acted RPG, this cannot be done so shoddily, it just doesn't lend to a good player experience.\n\nFinally, I have to mention the uncanny valley-effect while watching the cutscenes. The characters don't look at each other, or the camera is pointed so it appears like they're not looking at each other, not making eye contact and not syncing the lip movement to what is spoken. They're also not standing naturally in relation with each other, sometimes standing with a huge space between each other and sometimes right up in each other's faces, not making eye contact of course. It's instantly noticable and very distracting in my opinion.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would not recommend "Bound by Flame", as it tries to do what other games in the genre does, only it never really gets it right or well enough to be passable.\nAn RPG is built on setting, story and characters, and "Bound by Flame" fails to deliver an engaging story with interesting characters in an immersive setting.\nAn action RPG is built on a good fighting system and tight controls, and "Bound by Flame" fails to deliver either, as the fighting system is heavily biased to one path and the controls are sluggish and unresponsive.\nA lacking player experience, with an annoying camera, uninvolved voice acting and poorly produced cutscenes, cements the foundation of my recommendation for you to NOT get this game for anything less than a "75% off" deal, and only then if you're a fan of the genre. There are better games like "Bound by Flame" out there, better games on Steam even. Instead, play the Assassin's Creed series, the Mass Effect series, the Baldur's Gate series, the Dark Souls series, Darksiders, Bastion or even Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.","May 26, 2014","false","41.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story is on point, always leaving you wanting more, visual quality is beautiful, they did a dark fantasy world well. One part that caught my eye quick was upgrading equipment. If you equip a breastplate it starts off as a breastplate only, but you can upgrade it to have shoulder guards, pouches and tassets. Not only do the upgrades increase the stats of the equipment, it actually changes the look of it. That I loved, not too many games include that small detail in when it comes to upgrading equipment. Something else that caught my eye, whenever you choose to release a little more of the demon within, it changes the features of the character slowly. Just helps show how releasing the demon within slowly consumes the humanity of the player.\n\nI can see how they got some ideas from The Witcher, which is just fine, another great game. Combat is smooth and fluid, easy to change from one stance to another quickly or stop part way through an attack to block instead or even jump back and cast spells. Not only is it enjoyable, it is a challenge also, normally most RPG style games just seem too easy. I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan, I give it an easy 5 out of 5.\n\nMy one and only complaint, I wish it was a little bit easier/quicker to aquire gold to spend at shops.

There are many Pyromancer Concept art on the games website showing a mix of Armor and Robes however you get nothing of the sort in this game, even leather armor looks too bulky.\n\nCharacter customization needs a lot of work, with only 5 basic choices you dont get much immersion. However the looks do fit the characters personality rather well.\n\nMy main dissapointment was the story.  The idea was great and very well thought out, however it doesnt deliver what it builds up to.  7 Icelords taking over the world and you meet 1 of them, you make really 2 choices that affect your demon influence/transformation in the entire game, other than that the game just does what it will.

While I do agree with other reviews citing clunky combat or a repeated parry attack attack repeat pattern, every enemy has a distinct fighting style (depending on your proximity/type of offense), and (at least what I can discern) the secret to combat is the well timed parry/dodge and risposte and judicious application of abilities and tools. I agree with some that as the single means (and as of my current in-game experience as all points into warrior with an emphasis on axes/crits/knockback/hp regen) of actually finding success in many fights, I can't find as much fun in engaging in combat which is after all except for the storyline why many play this sort of game. Take for example Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning - a great game (at least for me) that I played multiple times through because combat was so fluid with regards to movement, reaction, and board control. Without playing the Ranger spec with points yet (hopefully I get enough points to distribute among two full trees in one game), I get the sense that dodging alone gives you the mobility you need without requiring perfect timing allowing for greater success and generally more enjoyment. My point here can be exemplified with what I think is the second "boss" fight against the large (I'm trying not to give spoilers) swamp creature that moves pretty quickly etc. etc. As a warrior my option was to riposte just about every attack (and react to other mechanics, again I'll try not to spoil the fight) or fail. You might say an unforgiving game makes for a greater challenge, greater feeling of success...but I thought I was a warrior, and looking at the talents you get and weapon stats/upgrades available, damage reduction, interupts, and massive swings are my survival mechanism. Sadly I find even at master level while I have started to enjoy a new found balance with common undead and swamp creatures (interupts with bigger massive well-timed hits), boss fights still rely completly on riposte, if only to mitigate their damage. On almost every boss fight I've engaged so far it feels like the Ranger is a requirement (unless you cheese the fight which is pretty much what I've had to do - run away and regen enough health, get as many swings in with ripostes, inevitably get knocked back and lose 60-80 percent health, run away and heal up, repeat. Isn't that what health pots are for? Well..if I could reliably use one mid-combat then sure, but again you have to have a full few seconds to use one or the effect is canceled if you'r struck, at all. I feel like the warrior could really use a bigger hp and/or knockback/dmg reduction if we don't get a dodge, or some means of moving about the board faster. I feel like a great addition to the game could be a roll/dodge as emplyed in Kingdoms of Amular. Even this one addition I feel could make up for a lack in board movement and in-combat strategic placement, add much needed second/third/++ means of defense and combat complexity - and while on that subject I was rather sad to only see two moves per stance (warrior/ranger). You get a primary slash, and then a secondary (chargeable for a 2x round of slashes) more powerful attack. Something that I've come to expect from this sort of game and adds so much play-ability are combo attacks. On this note, while you can mash buttons and it does string the base attacks together, there's a lot of time inbetween moves where you effectively lose control of your character (except for parry/dodge which cancels the current attack and while does grant immunity from incoming attacks for that split second, feels a little odd). This lack of control is also seen when casting spells/buffs. Some you might argue have a talent you can acquire to make them instant cast, but take for example the warrior's war cry. You can't cast that mid-battle (usually, or without running away first) or you'll get knocked around. The buff itself only lasts for 15 seconds (if you've fully spec'd into it). With the time it takes to run back into battle (or engage to begin with) and more importantly the requirement that you riposte or get knocked back (usually), the effective buff up time with regards to atually buffed hits is pretty limited (again usually). I get though that the idea is with the buff you get a massive chance to knockback/interupt enemies, but sadly it just doesn't feel strong enough. In short I don't feel like there is enough control of your character or over enemies in combat. To touch on other peoples comments about your companion, there's another sort of cheese mechanic I feel you have to employ, at least before you get enough points to make your spec (reasonably) viable. Put them on defensive mode and let them tank a few mobs (or the boss..no really, I'm currently playing with a caster who while does little dmg can tank like a champ). To sum up - there's enough good here in my opinion to warrant giving the game a try. I'm definitely on the fence (without having played the ranger) when it comes to combat though - normal mob fights have become a bit more manageable and fun, but I've yet to engage in a boss fight where I felt I could reliably react to encounter mechanics (really just riposte/dodge) to win without having to run out and loop around a tree or something until regaining enough health (I am on the Buffalo difficulty although not sure how much of a difference this actually makes). Like some others have stated I feel that perhaps playing both the warrior and ranger in combat might grant a level of enjoyable complexity and greater survivability, but I've yet to see where the warrior really excels. Take a look at the Ranger's final talent..perhaps I should have put points into that first as maybe then I can have enough board control to non-cheese a boss and win.\n\n#Begin Update1\nI'd like to add a few new observations after playing for a bit more - after putting more points into interuption (warrior talent) and rage (hp regen on kill), as well as using a hammer with full interupt upgrade, I feel like normal mob combat (even more so than before) is a lot more enjoyable. I still have to make sure to balance parry and riposte when needed, but I don't feel that it is the only thing I can do to not die and plink away at the enemy. As well, I've made sure to put full protection for the most common form of dmg (frost in this case) and that seems to have helped a bit. I will still say though that boss fights still feel really out of whack. Without mobs to kill for rage or the hightened ability to interupt which I doubt i'll see on bosses I still feel like these sorts of encounters are my punishment for getting to see what's next in the story. I'd like to note that I've also turned the difficulty down to normal, and while I'm no means a novice when it comes to many game types, I think the variables used to harden difficulty perhaps wern't well balanced/tested? I'd be particularily interested to see how the console version plays vs. the pc.\n\n#Begin Update2\nEven more time spent wading through corpses and the undead - boss/mini boss fights do feel a bit easier with more stun ability, almost sort of silly. Combat ends up being melee until they arn't interupted and then either counter their melee or move away from an aoe/frontal cone attack. I'm finding my damage output feels lacking and not for want of better outfitting myself or trying to counter for extra crit (e.g. bone golems...)","May 11, 2014","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Does that make it an unplayable game? No. Is it a great game? No also. It's right in the middle. A playable game that's worth two playthrus just to see both sides of the morality scale (at least four if you want to unlock the achievements for each romance).\n\nLet's start by what they did right. The game holds up in story. Could it have been fleshed out more? Possible, but the reasoning you get in the ending justifies why you did it the way you did. The dialogue, at times, is nice and witty.\n\nNow let's talk about what went wrong. A lot of times, the animation doens't match the voice acting. Playing the game is like watching a badly dubbed foreign film, but the dialogue and subtitles are both in your native language. Not a deal breaker, but distracting. Also, the first 20 to 30 minutes where most people are running into their problems to continue is the hump of the game. It's admittedly slow, but picks up.\n\nThe combat takes a huge, huge hit in this game which for a RPG is not a good thing. You never feel like you've gotten stronger, even with upgraded weapons. armor, magic, customizations to said weapons and armor, and talents. Weak enemies are weak, strong enemies are strong, and your health will suffer for it. On the hardest difficulty, an archer can kill you in less than a handful of hits, and they're never alone. The enemy will gang up on you and beat you mercilessly. I found myself being beaten on the floor more than once and just having a "Well, this won't end well" moment. Unless you can manage the parry system for two-handed and dodge for dual wield you won't be having fun times. However, some people enjoy the difficulty so this can be pushed aside as a problem for certain people. If you aren't one of those people, stick with easy or normal (normal is still decently hard for an average person).\n\nThe weapon selection leaves something to be desired as well. You have two stances; one uses two-handed weapons and the other uses dual wield. There's no sword and shield, no staff, no bow(*). Two-handers come in sword, axe, and mace types and dual wield comes in...daggers. *= You have a crossbow, but it's always equipped and requires you to craft bolts for it and unless you want to put it on your quickbar it's hard to use.

I went into this game after only seeing one trailer and was unsure of whether it would be any good. I was pleasently surprised. There is a good overall story line which keeps you interested, not to long and drawn out that it makes you bored, and not too short that it makes you want to much more. There are a lot of sidequests that can be done for the different companions and they do add to the time. The skill trees and talents are quite varied and you end up using a lot of variety of skills just to survive. Battles are challanging until you get used to them, and remind me very much of the Witcher - in a good way. Overall this is a good game to play, if you are looking for a different RPG that is fun to just play either in one go (as I did) or on and off. As RPGS go it's not bad and I recommend it.","May 11, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have bought many games this year and I'd have to say this one is the best so far.\nMost people say the combat is clunky but it really isn't. It's all about timing, if you get the timing down the combat is as easy as it is in Batman (Ark. series).\nAs for the artwork, only one word can describe it....beautiful.\nThe char. creation is lacking as someone else pointed out with VERY limited presets.\nThe story, in my opinion, was amazing and flowed smoothly with very few plot holes (unlike most games).\nThe biggest thing that makes this game similar at all to The Witcher is the fact that you can press tab in-game and access a few quick options....in reality this game is in no way like Witcher. The combat is smooth if you have any logical thought as to how two-handed combat would work. There is no delay in parry or blocks (it's like Batman, delays in blocking are rare to none).\nThe voice acting is funny but the script itself makes it okay. Certain options will make you laugh, some will make you want to hit yourself for choosing them and others will make you feel like the self-rightous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you truly are.\n\nIn short, don't listen to the fan boys or the haters. This is a good game, it is worth the money, no it's not perfect, yes it is fun.\n\nPros:\nGood story\nCombat flows smoothly\nScript for story is well writen\nCrafting system is well thought out and easy to understand\nUpgradable equipment makes combat easier\nWicked art designs for everything\nBOOBS\nFairly long story that is easy to play through more than once.\n\nCons:\nPoor voice actors\nSlight glitched during dialogue that makes two chars fuse (not major just funny looking)\n***Sploiler*** You only get to kill one of the ice lords and he isn't very hard to kill\nSmall weapon and armor veriety\nEnd game boss is way harder than anything you fight in the whole game....like WAYYYYYY harder\n\nHope this helped and I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.\nRemember kidios, when reading reviews make sure you watch out for hater ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and fanboys neither one will give you an honest review. This one shows both sides. Yes it's a good game, no it's not the best game ever.","May 11, 2014","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story is on point, always leaving you wanting more, visual quality is beautiful, they did a dark fantasy world well. One part that caught my eye quick was upgrading equipment. If you equip a breastplate it starts off as a breastplate only, but you can upgrade it to have shoulder guards, pouches and tassets. Not only do the upgrades increase the stats of the equipment, it actually changes the look of it. That I loved, not too many games include that small detail in when it comes to upgrading equipment. Something else that caught my eye, whenever you choose to release a little more of the demon within, it changes the features of the character slowly. Just helps show how releasing the demon within slowly consumes the humanity of the player.\n\nI can see how they got some ideas from The Witcher, which is just fine, another great game. Combat is smooth and fluid, easy to change from one stance to another quickly or stop part way through an attack to block instead or even jump back and cast spells. Not only is it enjoyable, it is a challenge also, normally most RPG style games just seem too easy. I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan, I give it an easy 5 out of 5.\n\nMy one and only complaint, I wish it was a little bit easier/quicker to aquire gold to spend at shops. Other than that I have no complaints.","May 11, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many Pyromancer Concept art on the games website showing a mix of Armor and Robes however you get nothing of the sort in this game, even leather armor looks too bulky.\n\nCharacter customization needs a lot of work, with only 5 basic choices you dont get much immersion. However the looks do fit the characters personality rather well.\n\nMy main dissapointment was the story.  The idea was great and very well thought out, however it doesnt deliver what it builds up to.  7 Icelords taking over the world and you meet 1 of them, you make really 2 choices that affect your demon influence/transformation in the entire game, other than that the game just does what it will.  So example, choose the first influence choice and the rest of the game up until choice 2 is all demon action related. Same with choice number 2.\n\nThough  I enjoyed the game in the most basic sense, the developers really should have spent alot more time in this games development.

While I do agree with other reviews citing clunky combat or a repeated parry attack attack repeat pattern, every enemy has a distinct fighting style (depending on your proximity/type of offense), and (at least what I can discern) the secret to combat is the well timed parry/dodge and risposte and judicious application of abilities and tools. I agree with some that as the single means (and as of my current in-game experience as all points into warrior with an emphasis on axes/crits/knockback/hp regen) of actually finding success in many fights, I can't find as much fun in engaging in combat which is after all except for the storyline why many play this sort of game. Take for example Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning - a great game (at least for me) that I played multiple times through because combat was so fluid with regards to movement, reaction, and board control. Without playing the Ranger spec with points yet (hopefully I get enough points to distribute among two full trees in one game), I get the sense that dodging alone gives you the mobility you need without requiring perfect timing allowing for greater success and generally more enjoyment. My point here can be exemplified with what I think is the second "boss" fight against the large (I'm trying not to give spoilers) swamp creature that moves pretty quickly etc. etc. As a warrior my option was to riposte just about every attack (and react to other mechanics, again I'll try not to spoil the fight) or fail. You might say an unforgiving game makes for a greater challenge, greater feeling of success...but I thought I was a warrior, and looking at the talents you get and weapon stats/upgrades available, damage reduction, interupts, and massive swings are my survival mechanism. Sadly I find even at master level while I have started to enjoy a new found balance with common undead and swamp creatures (interupts with bigger massive well-timed hits), boss fights still rely completly on riposte, if only to mitigate their damage. On almost every boss fight I've engaged so far it feels like the Ranger is a requirement (unless you cheese the fight which is pretty much what I've had to do - run away and regen enough health, get as many swings in with ripostes, inevitably get knocked back and lose 60-80 percent health, run away and heal up, repeat. Isn't that what health pots are for? Well..if I could reliably use one mid-combat then sure, but again you have to have a full few seconds to use one or the effect is canceled if you'r struck, at all. I feel like the warrior could really use a bigger hp and/or knockback/dmg reduction if we don't get a dodge, or some means of moving about the board faster. I feel like a great addition to the game could be a roll/dodge as emplyed in Kingdoms of Amular. Even this one addition I feel could make up for a lack in board movement and in-combat strategic placement, add much needed second/third/++ means of defense and combat complexity - and while on that subject I was rather sad to only see two moves per stance (warrior/ranger). You get a primary slash, and then a secondary (chargeable for a 2x round of slashes) more powerful attack. Something that I've come to expect from this sort of game and adds so much play-ability are combo attacks. On this note, while you can mash buttons and it does string the base attacks together, there's a lot of time inbetween moves where you effectively lose control of your character (except for parry/dodge which cancels the current attack and while does grant immunity from incoming attacks for that split second, feels a little odd). This lack of control is also seen when casting spells/buffs. Some you might argue have a talent you can acquire to make them instant cast, but take for example the warrior's war cry. You can't cast that mid-battle (usually, or without running away first) or you'll get knocked around. The buff itself only lasts for 15 seconds (if you've fully spec'd into it). With the time it takes to run back into battle (or engage to begin with) and more importantly the requirement that you riposte or get knocked back (usually), the effective buff up time with regards to atually buffed hits is pretty limited (again usually). I get though that the idea is with the buff you get a massive chance to knockback/interupt enemies, but sadly it just doesn't feel strong enough. In short I don't feel like there is enough control of your character or over enemies in combat. To touch on other peoples comments about your companion, there's another sort of cheese mechanic I feel you have to employ, at least before you get enough points to make your spec (reasonably) viable. Put them on defensive mode and let them tank a few mobs (or the boss..no really, I'm currently playing with a caster who while does little dmg can tank like a champ). To sum up - there's enough good here in my opinion to warrant giving the game a try. I'm definitely on the fence (without having played the ranger) when it comes to combat though - normal mob fights have become a bit more manageable and fun, but I've yet to engage in a boss fight where I felt I could reliably react to encounter mechanics (really just riposte/dodge) to win without having to run out and loop around a tree or something until regaining enough health (I am on the Buffalo difficulty although not sure how much of a difference this actually makes). Like some others have stated I feel that perhaps playing both the warrior and ranger in combat might grant a level of enjoyable complexity and greater survivability, but I've yet to see where the warrior really excels. Take a look at the Ranger's final talent..perhaps I should have put points into that first as maybe then I can have enough board control to non-cheese a boss and win.\n\n#Begin Update1\nI'd like to add a few new observations after playing for a bit more - after putting more points into interuption (warrior talent) and rage (hp regen on kill), as well as using a hammer with full interupt upgrade, I feel like normal mob combat (even more so than before) is a lot more enjoyable. I still have to make sure to balance parry and riposte when needed, but I don't feel that it is the only thing I can do to not die and plink away at the enemy. As well, I've made sure to put full protection for the most common form of dmg (frost in this case) and that seems to have helped a bit. I will still say though that boss fights still feel really out of whack. Without mobs to kill for rage or the hightened ability to interupt which I doubt i'll see on bosses I still feel like these sorts of encounters are my punishment for getting to see what's next in the story. I'd like to note that I've also turned the difficulty down to normal, and while I'm no means a novice when it comes to many game types, I think the variables used to harden difficulty perhaps wern't well balanced/tested? I'd be particularily interested to see how the console version plays vs. the pc.\n\n#Begin Update2\nEven more time spent wading through corpses and the undead - boss/mini boss fights do feel a bit easier with more stun ability, almost sort of silly. Combat ends up being melee until they arn't interupted and then either counter their melee or move away from an aoe/frontal cone attack. I'm finding my damage output feels lacking and not for want of better outfitting myself or trying to counter for extra crit (e.g. bone golems...)","May 11, 2014","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Does that make it an unplayable game? No. Is it a great game? No also. It's right in the middle. A playable game that's worth two playthrus just to see both sides of the morality scale (at least four if you want to unlock the achievements for each romance).\n\nLet's start by what they did right. The game holds up in story. Could it have been fleshed out more? Possible, but the reasoning you get in the ending justifies why you did it the way you did. The dialogue, at times, is nice and witty.\n\nNow let's talk about what went wrong. A lot of times, the animation doens't match the voice acting. Playing the game is like watching a badly dubbed foreign film, but the dialogue and subtitles are both in your native language. Not a deal breaker, but distracting. Also, the first 20 to 30 minutes where most people are running into their problems to continue is the hump of the game. It's admittedly slow, but picks up.\n\nThe combat takes a huge, huge hit in this game which for a RPG is not a good thing. You never feel like you've gotten stronger, even with upgraded weapons. armor, magic, customizations to said weapons and armor, and talents. Weak enemies are weak, strong enemies are strong, and your health will suffer for it. On the hardest difficulty, an archer can kill you in less than a handful of hits, and they're never alone. The enemy will gang up on you and beat you mercilessly. I found myself being beaten on the floor more than once and just having a "Well, this won't end well" moment. Unless you can manage the parry system for two-handed and dodge for dual wield you won't be having fun times. However, some people enjoy the difficulty so this can be pushed aside as a problem for certain people. If you aren't one of those people, stick with easy or normal (normal is still decently hard for an average person).\n\nThe weapon selection leaves something to be desired as well. You have two stances; one uses two-handed weapons and the other uses dual wield. There's no sword and shield, no staff, no bow(*). Two-handers come in sword, axe, and mace types and dual wield comes in...daggers. *= You have a crossbow, but it's always equipped and requires you to craft bolts for it and unless you want to put it on your quickbar it's hard to use. Adding to the quickbar, it consolidates all your items, skills, and spells into one. No separate potion button, or spell button. You need to make the decision on what you want on it at the time. Usually you'll have your health and mana potion, and a spell or two and be done. It's easy to switch out however by hitting tab and changing them around, which also slows the combat down to a matrix-style crawl so you can better plan an idea.\n\nAs long as you go into Bound By Flame with an idea that it's from a lesser known studio, and it being their first RPG, you'll be fine. They did decent for their first go-around, and I've seen far worse come from smaller studios trying their first RPG and bigger studios who know the RPG game. Is it worth the $40? To me, sure. I got what I wanted out of it. Could you wait for it to be on sale in a weekend deal or summer/winter sale? Absolutely. You shouldn't, however, count it out.

It feels like they had a lot more planned out that never came to fruitation.\n\nIt's really not worth the price tag and despite how cool the combat feels: it just cannot carry the rest of the game.\n\nI'm sorry but I'm goign to suggest you pass on this, which is a shame because it had a lot of potential.","May 10, 2014","false","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My internet has been having issues so I've been playing mostly offline)\n\nI recommend this game but only when it's on sale. It's not the best game I've played but it's certainly not the worst, and it satisfies my needs as a lover of action RPG's.\n\nThe mechanics and environments resemble a not as good version of the Witcher 2. The magic is all fairly genaric (flaming sword, fireball, flame sheild, etc) but the ability to switch between fighting stances at the press of a button is a definite positive that helps add strategy to the fights. The Dark Souls-esque choice between allowing your demonic powers to take over or staying human brings an interesting choice to the player, which helps make up for the not-so-great level up system.\n\nBut it makes up for that flaw only partially. The perk trees don't offer you many options for character builds. You have a choice between a one handed sword and dual weilded daggers, and you can choose whether to use magic or not. That's about it. There are only three, undersized skill trees, which kind of makes it feel like the developers just didn't feel like making more trees. Despite the pressence of alchemy and crafting, there's no tree for that (a few perks here and there but nothing major), which I think is a big oversight.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. The controls are all fairly intuitive so long as you reassign some of the curious, strange default key bindings (One of the actions is bound to L by default. ...What?). Everything necessary is there for what the enemies ask of you as far as I've experienced.\n\nThere's enough variety in enemies for my needs, and they all pose a decent challenge even on normal difficulty. I never felt like I was slashing through chumps. There are some points where the camera can be annoying but it's infrequent enought to be an ignorable issue. It doesn't make you depend on health potions but it gives you the supplies for some if you need them, which I like.\n\nThat being said, the AI isn't the best. If you circle around the bosses, they'll do full attack combos in completely the wrong direction, and a lot of enemies won't follow you outside of clearly defined zones. You can be three feet from them, and so long as you're outside of their spot, they'll turn their back to you. I've killed a lot of hefty, fat guys purely by messing with their pathing. Don't get me wrong. The fights are still enjoyable, and the enemies also have their smart times but for some of the harder fights I felt like I was winning by exploiting the AI instead of mastering skills.\n\nThe graphics and music are enjoyable and the lighting is done well, though the voice acting can be cringeworthy at times. Like, Final Fantasy X level cringewortiness. It didn't bother me too much because I've grown accustomed to bad voice acting from 200 hours of Skyrim but if you value voice acting in a game, prepare yourself ahead of time.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable if you go into it with the right expectations. It won't blow you away but you can have some fun with it.","May 10, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked Of Orcs and Men/Mars War Logs, I suspect you'll enjoy this too. It's basically Mars War Logs in a fantasy setting with expanded content (more side quests, more items, more crafting, areas seem bigger).\n\nIf you haven't played their games before, temper your expectations. Spiders doesn't develop AAA titles. They work on a small budget and the scope of their games reflects the limited finances. If you're looking for a sprawling open world like Skyrim, just move along. Maps are setup much more like Dragon Age 2, fairly linear with things tucked away in corners. Game length is short (took me 11 hours on normal doing most of the sidequests). It is Action combat (not personally a fan), but it does function alright. My only complaints are only being able to dodge one direction (straight back and only if using daggers) and strafing don't really give the freedom of movement I'd like to have in this kind of combat system (would like to control dodge direct and/or have a roll). I had some minor annoyances with the camera in combat too. If you wind up getting an object between the camera and you're character you can't see what's happening, really bad for this kind of combat system.\n\nUsually Spiders does a very good job crafting compelling stories. The story here I found far less interesting than Mars War Logs or Of Orcs and Men (amazing story imo) and the writing didn't pull me in like those games. I also feel like the companions fell a bit flat here which is unfortunate as they aren't all cookie cutter archtypes. However, the writing is still better than a lot of other RPGs I've played. I found the game to be fairly bug free, other than archers shooting at you despite facing another direction, and two random crashes which seem to be linked to a compatibility issue with my GPU (AMD Radeon 6950 HD).\n\nOverall, not a bad game if you're expectations are in line with the offering. I would call it my second favorite Spiders game behind Of Orcs and Men.","May 10, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the game surprised me.\n\nFrom looking at the screenshots a lone it looked very... ' cinematic '. Like the main highlights of this game may be just cutscenes. I figured the gameplay would be overdone and too showy like Assassin's Creed's ( just as an example, not hating on it. )\n\nBut the good graphics kind of threw me off. Rarely is a game blessed with good graphics with a comfortable and simple gameplay.\n\nThe user interface is simplistic, easy to use, and not at all complicated. Pretty straight forward.\n\nI've only played for a hour or so, and so far the only thing I can say negative about this game is that the Voice Acting while not terrible, is a bit lacking. ( I'm just picky with those things. )\nThe use of swearing to add either grittiness or to add some form of crude humor seems a little uneeded. But I guess at times I did have a little chuckle.\n\nAlso the lore is kind of not explained to you, one of those cases where they throw you in the middle of a new world and you're just suppose to pick up on stuff. Not much is explained to you about it, though you can talk to characters and learn more.\nWhich brings me to my next part, the characters are all designed pretty well. Unique with distinguishable personalities.\nThe dialogue reminds me alot of Mass Effect or Dragon's Age. Which I'm quite fond of.\n\nOverall I give this game a 8.0 / 10\n\nThe game is nice, especially if you're a fan of such games like The Elder Scrolls or Bioware's Dragon Age.\nMy only gripes as I said was the lack of info on lore ( I'm a lore nut. )\nAnd the somewhat scrambled voice acting.\nOther than that, It's a great game.\n\nCo Op would be great though!","June 21, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selvec/recommended/243930/","Selvec","Selvec","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selvec/","162 products in account","Bound by Flame - I Completed the Game\n\nAlright. So few points first. I don't write reviews. I critique other reviewers, and don't write them myself because I generally don't finish games I play, its often disappointing, so be forewarned this review may be amateurish at best.\n\nBound by Flame (Forthwith referred to as BbF) is a third person RPG made by Spiders Game Studio. Spiders has brung us various different games of middling quality such as, Of Orcs and Men and Mars War Logs. Of Orcs and Men was considered bad, Mars War Logs was considered average, I enjoyed both. As such I consider Spiders to be in that limbo spot as not an Indie developer, but not a AAA developer either. They make fun games, you like them or you don't. Simple. Anyway, back to the game.\n\nIf I had to describe Bound by Flame in one sentence it would be the following: "Fun hard game, with decent graphics, poor voice acting but interesting story, and a few difficulty problems." To say that Bound by Flame isn't going to be for everyone would be an understatement. The game requires a lot of patience to learn. Spiders seem's to have forgotten to explain to players how to play their game effectively, either that or they don't understand how to play their own game. I'll believe the former as its a lot less shocking. So before you even get started in this game, go read the forums and maybe make a post asking for some advice, otherwise you will be put off the game straight from the get go, like many reviewers have.\n\nNow when we start this game we are introduced to Vulcan, BbF's protagnist. The mans a bit of a jack off, he's a mercenary though, and apperently young, so I guess thats to be expected. After a brief intro section, which attempts to explain the game to you (badly), you will find yourself in control of some rather unexpected powers, and on the run from a genocidal army, and this is where the game actually begins. Now from this point I'm going to break the review into sections, because I found that it will read like a novel if I don't.\n\nGameplay\nFirst things I noticed when I played was I died...a lot. Not all of it was fair. I tried to focus on aggresion, which is how I usually play 3rd person RPG's, but I quickly learned that the enemies in BbF do not like aggresive people, and are pretty used to dealing with them. Furthermore, I thought my AI partner was useless, I quickly learned they were not. The AI is essentially there to fill the role of a tank/healer/disabler, depending on the commands you give them. You can tell the AI to defend, and it will do an excellent job of staying alive, allowing you to deal with the enemies. You can tell them to attack, and they will take the heat off you, but then become quite squishy if you don't let them defend fast. This is both useful, and a pain in the ♥♥♥, depending on how you like to play. The enemies tend to follow a pattern of attack, and once you know it the game can become easy, also you shouldn't forget about your traps, and items because they will help a lot at higher difficulty levels. The game tells you to switch through stances to, though other reviewers seem to have ignored this, so don't be them and remember that both ranger and warrior have advantages. Ignore pyro for anything other then support abilities as its not a stance, its just flavor.\n\nNow the major issues I had with gameplay was a few bugs that hopefully will get fixed in the future. Sometimes enemies seem to ignore interupts, or worse they interupt your interupt, which can make playing the game intensely frustrating. Furthermore the environments themselves can impede with the gameplay. Its nice having a big well developed environment, but if the player gets stuck in between an object, or something blocks their camera when they are fighting, it can put people off wanting to contiue playing the game in the future. Finally I encountered a few enemies that spawned behind walls, or in area's I wasn't able to move to, and just attacked me from there. Archers are the worst for this, there is a point where enemies come from this gate thing constantly, but the archers seem to end up spawned in an area that you can't actually get to, so you can't kill them.\n\nPostives? The gameplay is challenging. It really makes you think at times about how to tackle an enemy. Also the enemies can be pretty varied at earlier levels (not so much later), so this makes for a nice change from the normal armored enemy with big blade combo present in certain other games (*Cough* Dark Souls 2 *Cough). Finally the animations seem nice and flowing, they don't stop in mid animation or anything stupid like that. Not much else to say, the postives are the gameplay works and is fun. Thats pretty much all you want in a game.\n\nGraphics\nOkay so you may have heard varying reports about this one. I'm a little biased here. I played the game using Durantes GeDoSaTo alpha1a tool to increase the textures to 4k, so my game looked god damned beautiful. But others have reported that the graphics and texture quality has gotten bad in later area's. Again I personally didn't notice this, but I did notice that the later area's got a bit less varied in environments. In saying this, I guess how would you expect a big ice lords castle to look? It meets the pre-reqs. Big, Icy, Castle like, full of undead and snow. Its not a work of art, its meant to be a bastion of depressed cold death, and it kinda looks like it. Though in comparison to the sweeping landscapes of the first area's, and the varied swamp, I guess it doesn't really come up to par.\n\nStory/Dialog\nSo I really enjoyed the story. It's an epic tale about a desperate battle, against an immensely more powerful enemy focused on wiping out all life. Typical RPG stuff, nothing new here really. But the way its presented is quite well done. It has all the twists and turns your expect, just don't look for surprises as they aren't there. You'll probably get all the "shocking" things before they happen.\n\nNow the dialog on the other hand. *groan* Okay so its a european studio, I understand this, but is the translation really this big of a problem? Often times I found what was written on the screen, and what was said by the characters, to be completely different. Sometimes the dialog was non-sensical. Then there is this romance scene with the goody good female, and its just painful to listen to. I like Spiders games, but dialog is not their strong point. They need to hire a better translator I think. There is one shining star here, and he doesn't appear till much later in the story however. Mythas (or something), is by far the stand out of the cast, and I suspect he was written by someone who at least has a small grasp of storywriting. Because everything he says is just plain gold. Its like watching William DaFoe in a terrible movie. The rest of the movie can be trash, but when DaFoe opens his mouth, you suddenly know why you spent your money on this thing.\n\nAudio\nOkay so this is probably going to mix with dialog a bit. The audio in the game is okay. Its not amazing, its not terrible, it's just okay. The voice acting is the downside, its horrible. Except that one character I mentioned above. Everyone else feels stiff and boring with little to no personality in their voices. Sybil, who you encounter early in the game, is by far the worst of the lot. Its like talking to a brick wall, and she has all the personality of one. Its compounded by her being a love interest.\n\nFinal Word\nSo the review is ending aprubtly because I didn't realise I had a character limit on these things. To put it short and sweet; The game is fun, its hard, is plauged by some annoying bugs. But its still better then half the $60 trash most AAA's put out, and its only half that price. Its a fun distraction from all the platformers and ♥♥♥♥♥ on steam lately. By if you have cash to burn and want some fun, otherwise save for Watch Dogs.","May 16, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have friends that were talking it up. They kept telling it me it's a Dark Souls-lite type of game. After about three hours of playing I had enough of it. It's not a bad game, it's a fairly generic 3rd Person RPG, and it's mechanics have more in common with the Witcher 2 than DS. It's a buggy game, and still crashes to the desktop several times with no warnings or error messages. I played with a 360 controller as the interface seemed to be designed for it, but the keyboard functionality seemed to be there.\n\nCombat is accomplished with two buttons, one is a basic attack and the other is a chargable combination of attacks. You have to switch between fighting styles based upon your opponent. You also have limited use items that you can use during combat - crossbow, traps, potions, etc. Then there is pyromancy, a type of spell use.  It all sounds Witcher-esque right?!\n\nThere is a crafting system in place that allows you to make limited use items as well as modifying your weapons and armor. It really doesn't mean much when you modify your weapons and armor as there are plentiful replacements that seem scaled to the area. In 3 hours I had found 9 swords/axes/daggers/hammers and a completely new set of armor (head, chest, arms, and legs). The weapons and armor crafting only do small percentage upgrades - so you can skip it unless you want to grind to find components to upgarde each new find. The weapons/armor crafting does offer some visual changes to the gear.\n\nYou play as a member of a mercenary company in the middle of a war with a necromancer. While in a battle a demon possesses you giving you your pyromancies. The story is lack luster and I found myself quickly skipping through things rather than listening to them. The voice acting seems find, but it doesn't seem to matter when the story is so generic. The character models are also a couple of years old, and seemed slightly odd anthropomorphicly - especially the female models.\n\nI wouldn't buy this game at it's full price point. It's not a bad game, but it's also not an interesting game, and for the money you could buy a really good game. If you really love fanatsy games it could be a diversion between titles, but I'd recommend replaying something you really like because this game leaves no impact.","April 23, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the developer either didn't have the money or the time or the talent to actually realise these ideas. This game is just not particularly good.\n\nThe story is, on paper, quite interesting... but generally awful voice-acting and dodgy writing made it very hard for me to get invested. I just didn't care about the world and its people, so why would I want to save it? It was an easy choice, then, to "embrace the demon inside" but even that was very disappointing. No one seems to acknowledge that my character is looking more and more demonic.\n\nIn fact, the game seems to have a hard time recognising your character in general. My female character was addressed as a man more often than not, really. Dragon Age Inquisition this isn't.\n\nThe combat system is similar to The Witcher 2 but lacks any semblance of nuance. Quite frankly, all enemies have stupendous amounts of health and armour whilst you yourself can easily be killed within three hits. Even on the lowest difficulty level. It's touted as "strategic" combat, but don't be deceived. What they mean with 'strategic' is that you're expected to go for hit-and-run strategies when you're facing more than simple zombies because otherwise you're in for a world of unfair pain.\n\nGraphics-wise this game isn't overly special but it isn't bad either. I found that the game ran really smoothly on my system (which isn't the bulkiest rig around, I can assure you) and the caverns had some nice glistening wall textures. Hair looks terrible, however, and the lighting has an excessive bloom effect that just blurs everything.\n\nBy the way... Did I mention that the voice-acting was bad? It's been a while since I have been so frequently annoyed by voice-acting. The voices are ALL over the place, with "British" accents that sound like they were done by Americans, some terrible "Oirish" accents and some inexplicable Americans too. I mean, why exactly is the main character American when almost everyone else speaks with some sort of British/Scottish/Oirish accent? Oh, and one character in particular sounds Russian. Because why not.\n\nOverall, this is a budget game that has bitten off more than it could chew. Only die-hard RPG fans should consider acquiring this, and even then, you have to ask yourself if you don't have better games to spend your time with.","February 3, 2015","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it on sale and I still feel like it underdelivered in a big way.\n\nGraphics:\nExtremely dated.  The worlds feels empty, the maps are small.  The animations remind me of Gothic 1, but slowed down to try to copy the feel of the Souls games.  The environments are very low polygon count - only my rig running at 1440p with everything cranked all the way up, it really looks a lot like morrowind with a high def texture pack.  And the textures, ugh.  It's an early 2000 looking game for $40 in 2014.\n\nSound:\nI couldn't get past the voice acting.  Between the bored, can-barely-read-lines-from-the-script and the painfully bad script, I couldn't get interested in the story at all.  By the way, what bits of the story I managed to catch (and I usually pay really close attention to the story!) seemed pretty weak.\n\nStory:\nI guess it might be ok, but it is conveyed via terrible voice acting with profanity that is distracting by how ridiculous it is.  I don't have a problem with swearing in a video game, but when your characters speak like a 2014 recent college graduate and then throw in words with a misguided "medievel flavor", it is pretty distracting.  I guess you're some kind of unexpected hero trying to save the day from some evil guys.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's bad.  There is a skill tree that I suppose is meant to add some depth to it, but you start with almost all of the skills and the skill tree just makes your skills scale up a little as the enemies scale up.  The actual combat is like an awkward dark souls, where you have to use timing and mobility to win.  The problem is that the animations and everything else are so bad that it's frustrating or boring to play.  Sometimes games that fail in graphics or story are still super fine, like minecraft.  This game is just bad and not fun.\n\nI can't believe they want $40 for this.","February 4, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a massive buildup of sidequests and interesting characters via an atleast decent dialogue. I got really excited and practically plowed through it all in one day. Only to be really disapointed by the following chapters. It's still decent in many ways. It is a full story even though it seems to have bin speed up and could use atleast 7 more chapters to make it into what i'd call a full game.\n\nThe graphics aren't as bad as many people seem to think. Sure there area alot of reused tectures and some rather half-arsed piles of corpses. But this is to be expected by a low-budget enterprice as this looks to be. And in my oppinion, if this is the case, they did a rather fenomenal job actually finnishing it off. As many games today never really get finnished, or gets bought by EA and forced out before they're harlf finnished, atleast they didn't let EA do that to them.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good, entertaining anyway, a mediocre player like me had to play on easiest to only die about 4 times throughout the game.\n\nSo my final virdict is I recommend it, almost solely because of the first chapter, not counting the prologue, and it's somewhat entertaining gameplay. However not at full price, since i would not actually call this a full game, sorry devs.","February 7, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Read without worry. Do not expect a game on the same level with Dragon Age, Skyrim, The Witcher, etc. design- and gameplay-wise. It is more like one of those b-movies except for being an RPG. So it is more compareable to Two Worlds, Venetica and a bit above Demonicon. So you have to kind of love such games with all its flaws. But you MAY like this game, anyway.\n\nYou can clearly see where the devs have gotten their inspiration from. The combat system reminds you of The Witcher 2. You have to take your time, block at the very right moment, control the crowd. Hack and slash is different. Some enemies can give you a lot of trouble. And its mechanics are somewhat fast and directly to your input. The dialogues and non-player character development of Dragon Age or Mass Effect. You have several companions with different opinions on on-going events. In most cases you can take one of them with you to support you in combat or give comments about the situations. You can question their motives and get quests from them. But don't expect it exactly like in Dragon Age or Mass Effect. It is pretty much a dumped down version but it is not that bad either. Thus, it makes it pretty interesting. Your companions tell you their opinions, give advices how to decides which makes it not easier since you also have a "demon" inside you, trying to take over control of your mind and body. Some people will lie to you, some just skip the truth and you'll never know what their up to. There are sympathic characters and some you won't agree with and even dislike them.\n\nBut be aware of the illusion of decisions. There are decisions and they effect the gameplay to some small degree but basically, the overall course stays the same. There are minor changes with the companions traveling with you or the specific scenes of decisions get different. But there are decisions leading you to different (or more) information than others. So if you re-play a scene there might be a surprise for you! (I won't spoiler for you ;) )\n\nThe crafting system is nothing superior but it is a very nice gimmick to personalise and improve your equipment. It is very unrealistic (a pommel improving ice resistance *cough*) but fun, however! You lack of poison resistance and those poisonous monsters give you a hard time? Just craft you equipment to your liking, e.g. with increased resistances, more damage, more critical hit chance, etc. You can also salvage no more used equipment in order to get back some materials.\n\nThe sidequests are simple fetch quests. Nothing special here but sometimes with a little surprise. But what makes you keep going you might ask? Well, it is not the very average dialogue-writing rather than the twisted characters with a, and now it comes, fast paced plot. You get bored with stories evolving over hours? Stories that try to tell you everything from the start and build up very slowly its dramaturgy? You won't get something like that in Bound by Flame. You CAN read you through monster and character descriptions like in The Witcher. But you aren't forced to do so.\n\nIf you can get this game in a sale, don't hesitate if you can take pleasure out of RPGs from small studios.","May 17, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And not an AAA one. My main complain that sooner or later game becomes button-mashing fest with uninspiring story. I'm at act 3 (after sewers) and I don't think I'll finish this game soon. Linear, boring, small locations, generic loot, same enemies all the time, same tactics to kill all of them. Enter room - clean mobs - go to next room - clean the same mobs. After the middle of the game, writing is non-existent and choices doesn't matter. If you want a low budget slasher, play Hunted: the Demon Forge. More boobs, better design, more interesting story.

But when it abruptly ended I was like 'What the heck?', that was a surprise.\nOn the good side I really enjoyed the combat, it's a very playable game and the warrior tree was to me the best route for that instinctive enjoyment.\nVoice acting was horrific, the single worse component of the game and a real immersion breaker, especially as this game followed my first play through of The Witcher 2, of which this game was clearly inspired by.\nUltimately, enjoyable but short and shallow for an RPG.","May 17, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is kind of linear and easy to guess. The combat system is fun but less tactical than I thought. The party members all have a personality of their own, but we can't really get attached to them since there aren't enough dialogue options. The plot changes if you chose good or evil, there is no inbetween. Any of the romance options have really few moments dedicated to them, not enough. Plus the language has a "Holywood" kind of vibe. It didn't really fit for me.\n\nThe environment, game logistics and customerisation systems, and even the crafting system all have my thumb up. The music is marvelous and still good even after the second playthrough.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game. I still think it could have been a whole lot better and it felt like a cheap ripoff of dragon age.\n\nAlthough, I would recommend this game to parents that have a hard time finding games for their 12 to 15 years old kids. They often want big games that are rated 18+ with an adult vibe. This game would be a good inbetween since there are no visible sex scenes and not that much violence.

As for full price, eh, i'm not entirely sure its worth the $40 price tag.\n\nBound By Flame has a pretty decent story about a struggle for power within yourself and how you use that power to fix the world from the tyrants trying to take it over. Granted, it didn't really bring anything new to the table, it was still an enjoyable game. Enough so that i wanted to see how the story ended. There are a few choices you will make through the game that will impact the story a bit, which give it a good RPG feel, but nothing that compels me to go instantly replay to see what the different choices would of changed.\n\nNow the good of the game. The combat is fun, though the block/riposte function took a bit to get used to and timed right. It did however give the game slightly more difficult combat and its not just about button mashing. There's also a decent amount of armor, weapons, and choices to upgrade them and make them your own. There's 2 fighting stances, heavy weapon and daggers, that allow you to jump into different situations how you please. The voice acting was decent. Not awful, but nothing fantastic either. Each character i encountered felt as if they had their own personality, which is why i feel this as a positive. Also the game length overall wasn't awful. I'd say there was maybe 6-7 hours of mandatory story and the rest was doing side quests.\n\nAnd the bad. The graphics are sub par. The particle effects were good, but the models and environments left much to be desired. Granted the different stances were nice, i didn't find that the dagger stance put enough into the game to merit changing stances all that often. Bringing companions into combat didn't feel like all that much help either. Mostly just meat shields to help deal with larger mobs or harder enemies. Also you could chose how they fought and other then one being able to heal, there was really no change in combat other then what i stated before.\n\nOverall the game wasn't bad. The combat was fun, the story hooked me in enough to want to find out how it ended, the graphics were meh, the gear and loot ♥♥♥♥♥ aspect definitely itched that itch, and other then the riposting element the controls worked well.\n\nI'd give it a 6 maybe 6.5 outta 10","April 29, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A oddly crude script and odd writing choices let it down, along with some mixed voice acting. The impact of your choices is never quite clear, and the reactions of characters as you become more and more demonic borders on bizarre, with only a few commenting upon your outright demonic appearence mid to late game, yet still treating you as if you were the same human. Gameplay wise, it plays like a fable game, with mutliple combat styles, with the magic sadly constrainted to late game due to needs for specific builds to actully be useful. Difficulty widly fluctated also, with even regular fights being very challenging on normal early on, to bosses being only beaten through cheap tactics and spamming parry.  Many bosses and enemys relied upon shockwaves to discorage melee rushing, except several such as the ice general were way too powerful, with AOE's taking up half the arena and most of your health.  The game also suffered from some glitches and bugs with characters getting stuck on climbing patches, and referancing events in dialouge yet to happen.\n\nThis was a game with some fantastic ideas,  but like mars war logs is let down by flawed execution, unfocused character development and a combat engine that really needed some work. The final boss especially highlighted problems with the system, as if you don't bring traps or a good crossbow and at least 60 bolts you are a bit screwed. If you like action rpgs, this is worth a shot.\n6/10.","May 5, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've lost count of how many tries the damn thing took me.\n\nThis game isn't the longest or the most polished game ever but I liked the plot, the atmosphere and the characters. You can be male or female and I really liked the female choice, she has a bad-♥♥♥ personality. The controls felt like a simplified Dark Souls, I didn't find them particularly awkward but some of the fights can be very difficult. Controller support is very good. There are quite a few choices to make that affect the flow of the plot, the endings and even your character's appearance. Weapon and armour customisation also changes your appearance a lot, a system I liked, although initial character creation is a little limited. Although the world is very linear with no ability to backtrack, there are quite a few side quests with good rewards and lots of hidden treasure to find. This game is often compared to Dark Souls and I think I prefer it to the Souls series because you have companions and in general are a lot less lonely, also there is background music and you can guard-break properly.\n\nMost importantly, this game made my inner pyromaniac cackle with glee all the way through the story.","July 15, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jetan/recommended/243930/","jetan","Jetan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jetan/","408 products in account","Oh man, where to start?\n\nI've been playing Bound by Flame for about 2 and a half hours now, ensuring to compelte all of the sidequests that I could and all of the main quests that I could. I've made it to the first village, I'm level 12 now and have most of the sidequests in that village completed. So let's talk about the game itself before I give you my thumbs up or down. If you're just looking for a summary, head to the very bottom and I'll let you know what I think in a condensed format.\n\nGameplay:\nCombat\nBound by Flame is a combat game that tries to liken itself to the Fable series while also maintaining a bit of realism to it. You may be wondering if this is a good or bad thing. Well that's just it, I'm not sure either. I'm playing on the Normal difficulty level and find it EXTREMELY challenging. Maybe I'm just bad with the blocking or maybe other games have conditioned me to always expect a "Dodge" mechanic rather than a "Block" mechanic. The enemies tend to cause a LOT of damage to you and it can be kind of frustrating the first few times you witness your health bar go from half to empty in two seconds. This is probably where I'd say the game shines though. In the same vein that Dark Souls was made to be challenging, Bound by Flame has the same concept of challenge too it without overstepping its boundaries. It teaches you that you shouldn't just rush headlong into a confrontation and that's a good thing.\n\nThere are multiple stances you can use in combat, I have four unlocked so far. These are: Warrior, Ranger, Stealth and Pyromancy. The Warrior stance is just like it sounds: Wield a two-handed weapon and charge into the fray. The Ranger stance dual-wields daggers and is focused on dodging attacks and positioning rather than outright tanking. Stealth... Well this is where the combat mechanics fail in my opinion: Stealth seems rather useless if you don't pour points into it in the beginning. You can get a critical bonus from sneaking up on enemies, but only if you're not noticed and the enemies in the early game all tend to clump together which makes this impossible. Pyromancy I found to be fun, fire orbs, fire weapons and the general feel of spells that you would think you would get from the title.\n\nThere are also traps you can set up to make fights easier and let me tell you: I'm one of those guys who hordes his items and never uses them in the irratioonal fear that some situation could come up that I might need X items even though I could definitely use their help right then and there. I was taught how to create some simple exploding traps at the beginning of the game and immediately thought to myself how I would NEVER use them. Well, the game itself proved me wrong. The difficulty of some of the random encounters had me circling around trees at half health, setting these traps in order to kill my enemies or greatly weaken them so I could win the fight.\n\nCombat: 7/10\nPros:\n-Challenging\nCons:\n-Hard to get the hang of at first.\n\nCustomization\nA key point in the game that I saw was that it let you customize your character beyond just what armor you equipped. Each armor and weapon I found had slots for additional add-ons to be set in to the piece. Each of these add-ons provided different bonuses (i.e. resistance to poison, extra damage) as well as customized the look of your weapon or armor. I feel that if I played on a higher difficulty level I would absolutely HAVE to use the right customization options to prevail as even on the normal difficulty I was struggling with random encounters.\n\nCustomization: 8/10\nPros\n-Extensive, allows you to prepare for any situation\nCons\n-The depth of it will intimidate the average video gamer.\n\nCompanions\nOh man, this is the part I was excited about too. I've unlocked one single companion this far and I've had her pretty much since the get-go. At first I thought I would get a stronger level of customization with her (I.e talent trees) but was disappointed when I found out I could only influence her actions in combat. Also when out of combat I could tell her to be more offensive or defensive in our next fights. After being spoiled by games like "Mass Effect" which allowed me to form strong bonds with my allies, I feel like this was a huge letdown in that regard. I might as well have been carting around "Nameless Mage" with me through the swamps rather than "Sybil." You have the option of talking to them out of combat to discover more about them and they'll occasionally pipe up with opinions as you go about doing sidequests or fighting... But I kept asking myself the same question: What's the point? Not every game needs a romantic sidequest sure but I really feel let down by how shallow this feels. On top of that they aren't even too strong in combat. Like I said that the monsters are strong enough to kill you rather quickly if you aren't paying attention, my ally was content to stay in the back and shoot fireballs, occasionally heal me and facetank the mobs to her hearts content. She spent more time on the floor rather than not. At least a level-up option would have made this feature so much better.\n\nCompanions: 5/10\nPros\n-Someone to facetank the mobs\nCons\n-Lacks depth\n-No real reason to care for your allies.\n\nStory\nAs a fan of story-telling in games I feel there was a strong attempt to make something very interesting happen here and I hate to pass judgement when I'm still so early on in the story. But so far I'm not really drawn in to care too much. It's the standard undead horde versus humans and elves storyline that I've seen a while. The demon presence in you seems to be the main focal point of the story but nothing exciting had happened with it in the two hours and thirty minutes of my playtime. I feel like it could possibly evolve into something better but at the same time I feel like it could fall flat on its face.\n\nStory\nPros\n-It's not Call of Duty\nCons\n-Seemingly can not find a single ♥♥♥♥ to give.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, the combat is fun and challenging. The customization system has a great amount of depth too it. The companions fall short and it's too early in the game to condemn the story just yet (Though it seems likely to fall on its face). If you're looking for a challenging strategic-action game with Fable-like mechanics, you'll find it here. It's not worth a 60$ price tag for sure and you're better off paying at most: 40$ for it. So if you're just not straight up itching to play this game (In which case you probably already bought it) I'd wait for it go on sale at one point then get it.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\nPros\n-It's challenging\n-Customization!\n-Combat is actually kind of enjoyable\nCons\n-Companion system fell short of expectations. Don't expect to form Mass Effect style bonds with your companions.\n-Story is kind of eh this short into the game.\n-It'll intimidate your average gamer with the customization depth.","May 28, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not next gen but not too shabby at all.\n---------------------------\nLore and dialogue 9/10\n\nThe lore in this game was absolutely amazing! more or less every character had backstory and many dialogue options. It wasn't quite mass effect but it was good.\n---------------------------\nStoryline 6/10\n\nThe story for this game completely made sense wasn't particulary amazing but it was good. It's a shame it was not terribly long.\n---------------------------\nDifficulty 4/10\n\nThis game is incredibly easy. I picked this up for the first time and blitzed through the game side quests all on the highest diffuculty in less than 12 hours. Only the last boss is remotely difficult which took me 5 attempts. Enemies telegraph attacks from a mile away and you can pretty much become immortal by spamming backstep through enemies attacks.\n---------------------------\nGameplay 8/10\n\nThis remindes me of Dark souls A LITTLE and Dragon Age Origins mixed together.  The game is pretty fluid and although there are some things I would liked to have changed such as more enemy variation and better/more areas with more options than 'Climb'. Add some traps in and more enemies!\n\nOverall 7/10\nFor a first release by the company I think that this game was great and I reccomend buying this game and any other titles the developers make in the future.","May 28, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like many have said, you hit the enemy and there's not much else to it. The health bar decreases and you move on to the next enemy.\n\nThe targetting systems is old. Press "R" to target and flick your mouse-wheel up or down to change targets. I remember that from "Advent Rising" and even then I hated using it. It's not a bad system, but a little more intelligent optimization of the engine may have made targetting more intuitive.\n\nVoice acting is very emotionless in most cases but very over-the-top in others. Talk to Mason if you want to know what I mean.  The voice actors they chose for the male and female characters simply don't match the character models, but that's a personal opinion.\n\nDespite some of those very small issues, I am still having fun!  The story so far is great and the characters are interesting.  I try not to compare one game as a whole to another game. If I wanted another Dragon Age or Amalur, I would play them.\n\nHopefully you have fun, too. For $39.99, I think it's surely worth it.

I can't recommend this game to people looking for quick enjoyment, this is something you have to painstakingly planout from the beginning. I really don't want to start over making a new character; but my current build just isn't good enough to advance the story the way I want to. Do not buy this game if you're a more casual player... I usually casually take on the game in the first playthrough; but this is just too annoying for that with the enemy scaling.  I hope my opinion will change the further I get through this game.","February 27","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have finished the game in couple of different story and class paths and I have to say it was one of the best games I have played ever! It's a really awesome game and I definitely recommend it to everyone. If possible, I would like to see just two things changed:\n1- I wish we were allowed to walk away from the whole war. There is a part where this is hinted, but when the player chooses that option, the demon interfers and stops the main character from walking away. I understand why this option isn't provided as it would mean the war would consume the world, but I would really like to see a storyline where you have to run from city to city or hideout to hideout to avoid the war together with the companion you choose.\n2- I think the stealth mode in ranger path needs a little more explaination. It is a very fun class but the abilities are a bit unique and different from other games so a more thorough explaination would be very helpful to new players.\n\nI say this again: This game is a really awesome game and definitely deserves more exposure. I would love to play a sequence or a prequel to this game as I enjoyed the art, gameplay, class system and the music! Omg the music is just exquisit especially at the end where the dragon dives out of the mist. It's like seeing death itself manifested in form of a dragon. I get shivers every time I get to that part! And I don't know how many hours have I left the game on the main menu just so that I can listen to the intro music over and over again! In the end, I really want to thank the creators of this game for providing such a well-thought-out, artistic and fun game and ask them to please make more games like this!\n\nEdit 1: If I had to give it a ranking it would be 10/10!\nEdit 2: I just had a suggestion for the sequel of this game as well as it's prequel. For the sequel, the play can continue from where they make a choice in the end of this game to just severe the connection of the Ice Lords to the World Heart and hunt each Ice Lord down one by one. After that, te player can watch over the owlrd and help it's inhabitants rebuild cities and civilization. As for the prequel, the play can play as the Ice Lords or even the Red Scribes, but a meeting with the White Lady would be definitely moving and interesting.","March 26","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I recently came back and finished it, actually playing it from start to end two others time to get all achievements. A playthough is about 10-15 hours while getting 100% took me a total of 30 hours.\n\nThe game is not that hard but even the easiest difficulty can be punishing. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty much the same formula, can also get a bit repetitive but I personally liked it enough to play it three time. I was playing with a gamepad if it make a difference, not sure about the keyboard and mouse controls.\n\nThe game is kind of short, it feels like the end could have been the midpoint instead, only three chapters and the last is shorter. It's enough to end the story but the ending don't tell much and the whole game bring some interesting lore that is never used.\n\nThe music is great, most of the voice actors are pretty good and the characters are pretty diverse. The graphics are good, even though there is not that many different enemy types and areas.\n\nDon't expect the same quality as a big AAA arpg like Dark Souls or Dragon Age Inquisition but it's worth a try if you enjoy the genre and want something new.","March 26","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Mars War logs (same dev) and enjoyed the atmosphere of that game but the combat was a bit messy at times. After a little research it seems war logs players found bound in flame to have a much tigher combat system.  After purchase I am very happy to say I agree. The game is smoother, the skills are more straightforward, the characters are better, the crafting and upgrade systems is much more varied, and it feels a little like the first witcher game.  Combat has consequence though I find myself bruteforcing it from checkpoints sometimes (I wish there was a darksouls checkpoint system instead to force me to learn to fight properly #lazygamer).\n\nOverall I am greatly enjoying this game and it is definitely worth the 10$ I spent on it.

Here are a few key features of the game:\nFirst, being one of the most exciting parts of a game for many players, I must say the character customization is crummy. You can choose male or female, 5 preset faces, and 5 preset hairdos.\nThe item customization is not great. It is portrayed as amazing, but it is quite bland. Sure, some fo the upgrades look cool, but perhaps it's not the upgrade you want and so you don't get the best looking weapon or armor.\nThe combat feels boring and basic. The only thing you need to do is press Q or Space at the right time and find an opening to use abilities.\nThe bosses were too hard for their fighting style. Some of them had unblockable attacks that dealt too much damage and were fired off too fast. They were incredibly simple, yet they took such a long time to kill which made them drawn out and boring.\nThe visual effects were shoddy to say the least. All of your companions' spells looked like they were made for a children's game, which is to say cartoony.\nThe companions were useful in only two ways: some could heal you, and you could set them to block and act as a personal meat shield. It's not fun to attack enemies from behind with no fear of getting hit or even having to attempt a block.\nThe voice acting was probably the worst part of the game. It felt like I was reading a crummy fan fiction. The dialogue took too much time away from the game. I wanted to hear what was said, what I had to do next, and what was going on, but it took so long to listen that I didn't even care. It's likely that I often spent minutes at a time listening to just dialogue. There was also an annoying factor of trying to enter a location and receiving a two minute speech about whether or not you really wanted to go in there. After skipping parts like that and attempting to enter a new area again, I would be given another speech. I was finally able to enter a cave after the third time clicking "enter this cave".\nThe pyromancy tree was a bore. All of the spells felt basic. A wave of fire, a fireball, setting your weapon on fire, and a few defensive fireballs floating around you made all forms of pyromancy a snoozefest. There is no "excellent combination of weapon styles and spell" and IGN is one of the biggest sellouts I have seen.\nLastly, I can credit the story, it was pretty neat and I enjoyed it.\nIf you really wish to buy this game, wait until it is on sale and about $10. The game is too short and boring to be worth much more than that. Oh well, I am going to beat it anyway.","December 29, 2014","false","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall it's pretty solid aRPG, with fine combat, quite nice story and insteresting characters. Whole idea of sharing body with demon and turning into one or saving your humanity based on your decisions is awsome. Graphics are nice yet world is pretty limited - some sort of hallway simulator. For me it was way too short - it took me ~14h to complete the game with doing most of side quests. I can recommend this game, but it's for sure not for anyone.\n\nI need to write few words about combat I played as a warrior with 2h sword and difficutly was harsh. (Playing as stalker stance and using daggers is easier due to thier attack speed compared to 2h weapons). Monsters in this game have enormous pools of HP so don't expect hack'n'slash action combat - it's closer to Dark Souls than God of War with blocking attacks and waiting for opportunity to land blow or two. Then block/dodge again and repeat. Sometimes you had to use some "exploit" tactics to beat enemies (for example thier aggro-range, if you run away from them for enough distance they will start to back to thier starting postion - yet killed one don't respawn - so kill 1 enemy, "leave combat" wait for HP regen and then kill another one). You also can have one companion in your party but this feature it's kinda broken - they are only somehow helpful if you set thier behaviour as "defensive" so they can tank for you and you have free time to hit monsters back - until they're knocked out untill "combat end" (they can't really die).\n\nControls - this is a big "minus" of this game, controls are "clunky", attack windups with 2h weapons are too slow to be effective, kicking enemy shield does not work sometimes like it should, as a warrior you can only block, as a stalker you can only dodge. There is no roll-on side button and that makes dodge'ing some attacks almost impossible. This game would be way better responsive with dodge-roll mechanic.\n\nGraphics - besides it's a hallway simulator and zones are pretty limited, graphic quality is fine. Main character model is nice, animations are fine, cutscenes everything fits to the theme. Good point here - dark spaces at night are dark as they should be! (hello Bright Souls 2)\n\nStory - it's not bad, it's not good. Yet companions should have more backstory cause you don't really care about them. It's a wasted potential here.\n\nMusic and sound - fits perfectly - especially last boss theme. It's a strong point here.\n\nOverall it's not a AAA game, it's not even pretending to be the one, and it's not worth AAA price, but if you like hard games, hard aRPG games, you should give it a try when it's on sale.\n\nPS. Gamepad is strongly recommended for this game.","June 30, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know that may sound frivolous, but I like long RPG that take many days to complete.  Other than the aforementioned, the only item that seems to be lacking is a more robust crafting system.  Though you have the ability to craft by adding various thing to the existing items, the opportunity to build unique, and more powerful armor from scratch would have enhanced the gaming experience.  Still, I will have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would not hesitate to recommend it as a good game to own.

It's pretty much a discount Witcher. You only really get one choice though to change anything in the plot and it comes in the Swamps, and it basically boils down to "Let the Demon take over" or "Stay Human".

The graphics are fine, but they could be better. However, the voice acting is bad. It almost seems like none of them wanted to do it. (Well, the demon's and Mathras were okay.) The story felt rushed and the ending seemed like it was thrown together at the last minute. And you only meet one of the Ice Lords, the main bad guys of the game.\n\nIn my opinion, this one of the few games that could use a remake.

Second off, you’ll most likely enjoy it more or be less annoyed if you can get it on a Steam sale.\n\nBound by Flame is a linear RPG set in a dark fantasy setting (mostly medieval humans, elves and undead). Where this game tries to stand apart from all the other dark fantasy RPG games, in my opinion, is the following:\n1. Combat options are limited - either a two handed sword or dual wield daggers - but you are empowered by a fire demon to buff your attacks and give additional fire damage.\n2. You can upgrade or customise the armour and weapons that you loot or buy with ingredients that you can loot or recycle from weapons or armour.\n3. It is quite difficult. Presumably the developers aimed at Dark Souls difficulty, but for me the easy difficulty was enough of a challenge to keep me interested.\n\nBound by Flame is a good game – it is not an excellent game, yet you could believe that the developers were aiming for something spectacular, but then their time or money ran out. Some aspects of the game are truly excellent, but unfortunately the combination of all these aspects aren't as polished as you’d like.\n\nThe music is excellent; combat music or ambient music. It sets the somewhat sad and melancholic mood that underlines the whole “end of the world” situation.\n\nThe 3D models are quite good, however the quick time movie events that tells the story could have used more work. The voice acting was well executed, but unfortunately the subtitles contained quite a few spelling and typographical errors.\n\nCharacter creation is very limited: you get to pick one preset face out of four for each gender.\n\nEnvironments / maps are limited. Think Dragon Age 2 maps, but for a shorter game. Enemies respawn, so you can farm for loot or XP if you'd like.\n\nCombat is quite basic, yet effective. You only have two stances: melee, using a two handed sword, and ranger, using two daggers. Timing is critical as you have to block or dodge, stun (by means of a kick or crossbow bolt) or attack between enemy attacks. You can also make use of fire magic to buff and support your normal attacks (e.g. setting your sword aflame or throwing fire balls).\n\nYou get to loot each and every enemy you kill. Loot entails weapons and armour, as well as raw materials with which you can craft potions, traps, or components with which to upgrade your weapons and armour.\n\nStory wise it’s a tried and tested formula. The world is in danger and you have been empowered to be the only one capable to save it. You gather some companions to help you in this struggle, but certain choices will cause them to leave you. The choices are somewhat artificial – it doesn't change the story at all, except for the final scene and end credits. It is quite short; I wasted a lot of time farming and replayed a level or two and still finished in 20 hours. However, at the end of the game it feels like the developers had had a longer game in mind but were forced to quickly tie everything off and finish it.\n\nComparisons have been made between this game and far bigger and more successful games. Sure, the whole choice system is getting to be an empty promise as precious few games allow you to truly change the story by means of your choices. The storyline is always the same but for a few inconsequential differences. Therefore don’t expect this game to revolutionise the choice system, or anything else for that matter. Play it because it contains just good and clean hacking and slashing, some disturbing imagery, and some unexpectedly well rendered graphics and witty dialogue.","August 17, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The various battles were great, and plentiful; you really needed to use solid strategy to win each battle.  I only wish it had been a longer game.  I know that may sound frivolous, but I like long RPG that take many days to complete.  Other than the aforementioned, the only item that seems to be lacking is a more robust crafting system.  Though you have the ability to craft by adding various thing to the existing items, the opportunity to build unique, and more powerful armor from scratch would have enhanced the gaming experience.  Still, I will have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would not hesitate to recommend it as a good game to own.

The story itself hurts the game when they talk about the Seven Ice Lords, but you only deal with one of them really. It makes it feel like there should be a lot more to the game then what was presented, giving it a feel of being unfinished from the story aspect.
