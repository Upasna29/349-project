"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzbrown/recommended/265300/","dzbrown","Zanos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzbrown/","363 products in account","Overall, I had to say that I enjoyed playing this game. When I first started it, I was encountering some crashes but someone's suggestion on the forum quickly cleared up anything and I never saw a crash since. Regarding the gameplay, I enjoyed it. The combat did feel grittier than a Souls game, and I like how the magic in this game was much more 'supportive' rather than primary, as it can be in a Souls game (as an aside, I feel like magic ruined Dark Souls 2, but that's just an aside).\n\nThe boss designs were decent--they could use improvement, but I did enjoy some of them. I also did enjoy all of the little details they put in the game, like different ways to defeat bosses, different ending paths based on choices (which did seem a little hardboiled at times but was still a nice effort none the less). The only thing that frustrated me from time to time was the level design, which seemed labyrinthine.\n\nThere's lots of weapons in this game, and plenty of loot. The armor and weapon design were all decent.\n\nAll in all, is it "Souls-like"? Yes, it is. Do I care? No. It's not like Dark Souls was the first Action RPG. Is it a fun game? Yes, yes it is. Do I hope they make another one and improve upon the first? Yes.\n\nI think what sometimes people forget, especially with original titles is that to criticize it needlessly and blast it with negative reviews, and to make statements such as "don't support this publisher", will ultimately lead to less variety, innovation, and entertainment. This is not a defense of bad games, but it is a defense of "improvement". If they make another, and I hope they do, I hope they can improve the formula, add some additional features that make it interesting and continue to innovate on this extremely fun genre. The more the merrier, I say.","December 2, 2014","true","21.2"," 581 of 636 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","581","636","5","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xbob42/recommended/265300/","Xbob42","Xbob42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xbob42/","712 products in account","Lords of the Fallen gets a lot of things right, but is also blasted by many people for not being as polished as Dark Souls, or for even trying to be like Dark Souls.  Wherever you stand on that issue, I personally think the expansion of that sort of gameplay into a proper genre is good for business overall.  I want more games like Dark/Demons Souls, not less.\n\nIf you can get over the fact that yes, the game is very similar to the Souls titles, I think you'll find it to be quite a good game.  It lacks some of the bells and whistles of the Souls titles, such as the persistent and interesting multiplayer found in those games, but I believe it totally nails the combat, and is absolutely packed with secrets, both of which are some of the top reasons I enjoy the Souls games.\n\nThe story is a lot more straightforward than those titles (Sorry for all the comparisons, but the genre is still in its infancy and there isn't much else to compare it to, and this game wears its inspirations on its shoulders.) which can be both good and bad.  Good because you have a fairly clear motivation, bad because, well, let's face it, the voice acting is pretty mediocre and the talking animations and lip synching are actually kind of embarassingly bad.  Characters gesticulate wildly when saying the simplest things, all while retaining their stiff, wooden, doll-like faces and flapping mouths.\n\nThe stilted facial expressions clash furiously with the rest of the visuals, which have a distinct Warhammer (read: big shoulder pads, intricate armor, you know whether you enjoy that style or not.  I do, but you may not.) feel that is very consistent.  Having a very solid art style and beautiful technical work and then seeing Playstation 2-level facial animations is jarring to say the least.  It's not too big of a deal, but they put it in there, so I figured I'd give my two cents.  Also I feel it prudent to remind people that while the Souls games had decent voice acting, the characters rarely ever moved at all while talking and mouths never seemed to move at all, so, uhh, just throwing that out there.\n\nSo, let's talk about gameplay.  This game is said to be easier than the Souls games.  I never found those games to be particularly difficult so much as games that forced you to be patient.  Few fights ever required a high degree of dexterity, just that you observe and wait for an opening.  I think this game handles that just right.  But I warn you: If you're looking for a challenge, choose something besides the Warrior play style.  That class is a lot like the spell-casting class (Noble, was it?) in Demons Souls, where it was basically an easy mode for new players.  Try weird weapons, if you feel too tanky, wear super light armor.  I say these things because if you want the game to be difficult, then the default selections are not for you.\n\nThe game has fairly lengthy attack animations, longer than the Souls games in many cases, but it also has a bigger impact.  With my great hammer during a well-placed attack I can physically knock enemies across the room, and when it strikes the ground the sound design and visual effects really sell that I'm swinging a huge, deadly weapon and that it is not to be trifled with, but it also takes timing and understanding of each type of swing at my disposal.  I can out-poise some enemies if I wear heavy armor and just swing through it, or to challenge myself I can wear very light armor and rely on timing above all else.\n\nEnemies do have a bit of cheapness to them occasionally.  Not all hitboxes are perfect, you can get hit by attacks that appear to miss you by several inches, and sometimes enemies do a very familiar Dark Souls move of "sliding" forward at the end of an attack to force it to connect, which feels just as cheap here as it did in the Souls games.  Luckily, both of these problems are fairly rare and tend to be limited to just a few enemy types -- and thankfully after encountering them a few times I didn't seem to notice it happening anymore.  Shouldn't be there to begin with, but not as big of a deal as I thought it would be after the first few times it happened.\n\nI want to take a moment to warn you that I don't play these types of games quite the same way I think most people do.  I played a ton of Monster Hunter before I first played a Souls game, so I tend to rarely ever use the lock-on here.  I don't really circle-strafe enemies to fish for backstabs and I don't have many issues with the camera that allegedly appear due to what I assume is locking on in such tight quarters.  If you use lock-on for extended periods, you'll have to get that info elsewhere, as I can't provide you relevant critique on it.\n\nOf course, while it borrows from the Souls series, it also has its own little twists that I think are genuinely interesting that may help push the genre forward.  The ideas themselves aren't mind-blowing, but stuff like the experience multiplier for going longer without banking your experience is fantastic, as well as the experience degrading the longer you take to retrieve it after death.  To me, these are pure upgrades to the soul retrieval system in the Souls games, hands-down.  I hope this inspires future games in the genre to think of cool additions as well.\n\nI had quite a bit more to say, but this is getting very long for a Steam review.  So I'll wrap it up and give my conclusion:\n\nIs this game as polished or as in-depth as the Souls series?  No.  Is it some blasphemy to the genre that you should be offended by?  Absolutely not.  It's a great game, marred right now by some technical problems (I knew I forgot something!  The game is crash-prone at the time of this review and while performance on my Titan Black is fine, on plenty of other rigs it's all over the place.  Check the updates to see if they fix that stuff in a timely fashion.) but once everything is ironed out I absolutely recommend it to any fan of the Souls series if they want more of that style of gameplay, or people intimidated by the Souls games' obtuseness.  This is a good gateway game to those titles.  Don't be an elitist, games like this will push the genre forward, not destroy or harm it!  That's my take on it, at least.  I heartily recommend this!","October 30, 2014","true","17.6"," 423 of 474 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","423","474","2","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/265300/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","Rating - 81/100\nRecommendation - Worth looking at, just don't expect Dark Souls\n\nDisclaimer 1: Lots of people talk about crashing, but I had literally zero problems. I don't know if I'm super lucky or if issues have been patched, but I can't deduct points for problems I didn't have. Just be warned.\nDisclaimer 2: This game is not Dark Souls. If you're expecting Dark Souls, you'll be disappointed. If you're hoping for Dark Souls, you'll be disappointed. THAT BEING SAID, I will be doing comparisons to how Dark Souls works since it's probably the frame of reference most people will be coming from.\n\nI liked this game a LOT more than I was expecting to. Reviews for it were pretty terrible at first, and are only mediocre now, but the only thing I can think of to cause that is people coming in here with a mentality of "let's see how different it is from Dark Souls." It's clear from the get-go that the developers were trying to capitalize on a formula made prominent by the Souls games, but please try to judge this game of its own accord rather than compared to the genre juggernauts.\n\nRight off the bat, Souls players should feel comfortable. Combat is mostly focused on patience and energy (stamina) conservation, knowing when to block/dodge/strike, etc. Jumping in and flailing will get you ripped to shreds, and studying your enemies attack patterns = success. Killing enemies gives you experience, which you can use to level up attributes or spells at shards (save points). However, unlike the Souls games, using a shard doesn't respawn enemies in the world (that only happens when you die or leave the zone), but rather resets your experience multiplier. As you kill enemies, your experience multiplier increases, giving you a reward for taking risks and saving less often. When you die, you drop all your experience, and unlike the Souls games, you have a limited amount of time to pick it back up again before it vanishes. I liked the system a lot. It's a mild evolution on a formula, but it introduced just enough to keep things interesting.\n\nThere's some frustration with combat, though. It's inconsistent and unreliable what attacks will break an enemy's guard, and even when you do, their shields are back up before you're even mid-swing. Harkyn (you), on the other hand, seems to get stunned for 8 seconds. It's frustrating. Fights with shield enemies are either shoot-from-afar-with-my-gauntlet or block-their-hit-and-hit-back-until-death. Plus, hit detection is not perfect. I had a not-insignificant number of sword swings and gauntlet shots that simply passed right through enemies. It wasn't a rampant problem, but it should NEVER happen.\n\nStory-wise, I actually liked this game a lot more than Dark Souls (I welcome your knee-jerk reaction downvotes). A huge part of Dark Souls' mystique and whatnot comes from a complete lack of communication with the player. Lords of the Fallen is not that game. You have objectives (story quests only), the world is laid out more linearly, and while your hand is never held, the difficulty in the game is in achieving objectives rather than figuring out what to do AND THEN doing it. The story is serviceable, and moves around enough to be interesting, but it's nothing groundbreaking.\n\nI think this game actually serves as a good halfway step between standard RPGs and Dark Souls. The difficulty is more approachable, as is the game world itself. You have a mission objective, but no map or direction markers, and side quests are never tracked at all, so it's up to you to remember where people/things are. I loved it. It still left some of the questing burden on me, but I never got that "oooookay, what do I do now?" feeling. You're told to "fight to the top of the citadel" but then left to your own devices.\n\nHardcore Souls players might be turned off by that type of gameplay, but I welcomed it. No getting your intestines ripped out through your nostrils right away in the catacombs here. Don't get me wrong, this game is still difficult, but I had an easier time here than in the Souls games. I can't say for sure that it's because Lords of the Fallen is easier, since it's just as likely that playing through Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 2, and then Dark Souls again prepared me for this one. New players be warned, this is not an easy game. You can't really wander into an area you're not supposed to be yet, though, so there is that.\n\nThe world itself is not all that large (maybe half the size of Dark Souls), and there's a bit of backtracking, but it never feels all that repetitive. Enemies in certain areas will change and grow stronger as you play through the main story, so the parts where you do have to backtrack are at least interesting again. To be honest, most of the backtracking was due to side quests, which can be completely ignored. Fair warning, too, I did grind a bit (probably 4 or 5 hours' worth), but that's just because I wanted to try higher gear. I can't say for sure that it's necessary, although it did help.\n\nSpeaking of gear, this is one of the game's weak points. The armor sets and weapons look beautiful, and they're almost all beefy and chunky, but all of the classes end up being built the same way. I picked the Cleric class (the healing spell is FANTASTIC) and built my character for speed, but could have doubled as a tank. By the end of the game, my regular sword (there's shortswords, swords, then greatswords) did more damage than all but 2 of my great-weapons, and swung faster. I had all but one spell level unlocked (there's 4 spells per class, each with 3 levels), and enough strength/stamina/poise to withstand direct hits from the final boss with no damage. I honestly can't see how building solely as a warrior would have been that much stronger.\n\nI suppose that's another thing I liked about this game, though. In Dark Souls, even though I played as a tanky build, I always felt extremely weak, even right up to the end. In Lords of the Fallen, however, I really got a sense of how strong I became. Maybe it's because it's easier and quicker to backtrack and fight early enemies, but it felt quite a bit more apparent what effect all that leveling up had.\n\nOverall, I legitimately enjoyed my time here. The graphics are fantastic, the game world is beautifully-designed (even if you are in gothic castles 98% of the time), combat is satisfyingly meaty, the enemies are varied and interesting, the bosses are a decent challenge (they all have hidden bonus objectives too), and aside from a few small glitches, the gameplay was rock-solid.\n\nIf you come in to this game not expecting it to perfectly fill a Souls-shaped hole in your heart (and you have no crashing issues), you should enjoy it too. I thoroughly did, and I could easily see myself coming back to this game for another playthrough later.","September 25, 2015","true","28.9"," 428 of 483 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","428","483","12","19"

YES. Is it worth the full price? HELL NO!\n\nLong Version:\n\n(WARNING: I will compare this game to Darksouls games a lot since it's obvious that it tries to mimic it's mechanisms and gameplay style.)\n\nPROS: 1. Semi-Darksouls action combat - If you like the way Darksouls I & II handles combat chances are, you'll probably like the way this game handles it as well. The difference is that the combat in Darksouls is faster and more flashy.\n2. Beautiful Graphics - Although the graphics are brilliant and beautiful (scenery, armor, weapons, you name it...) some of them are a bit "samey". (More on that in CONS)\n3. The story - Unlike Darksouls where you have to scrape the story from item descriptions and where most of it you decide and invent for yourself, the story here is way more accessible. You are a convicted criminal whose crimes are tattooed on your face and your mission is to redeem yourself by destroying a fallen god. Sounds fun! There are more hidden lore bits found out from the few NPCs and much more numerous log files.\n4. Performance - I only played the game after the latest patch and can confirm that on my system (i5 3,5 GHz, Nvidia 770GTX, 16GB ram, SSD disk, every graphics setting maxed out) the game held a stable 60fps 99% of the time with maybe 2-3 times dropping to 45-50 FPS and only on specific places.\n5. Bugs - with the recent patches most have been squashed. Haven't really noticed any during my gameplay.\n6. Game Mechanics - There is a risk-reward system implemented in the game that works really well. The more enemies you slay before resting at a checkpoint the more it increases your exp. multiplier which in turn increases the exp. gain from other enemies. But if you are killed, that exp. will slowly drain away until you either collect it back or it drains completely. The only real big difference from the darksouls games.\n\nMEH: 1. Difficulty - Harder than most games, way easier then Darksouls II. To be honest I was expecting a more challenging game, but I guess this decision makes the game appeal to a broader audience.\n2. Enemy variations - too little variations. Same enemy models reused through the game. Most of the bosses resemble ordinary units only bigger in size.\n3. Customization - Oh my GOD. Everyone is overusing steroids in this game. From the main character to the lowliest mob. Want to role-play a squishy mage? Nope, here's a mage that bench presses 200 kg. Want to play as a sleek and agile rogue? Nope, here's a rogue with 140 kg of muscle. I prefer the big warrior class but to have the option to at least customize the face and a few sliders wouldn't hurt the game one bit.\n\nCONS:  1. Lack of NPCs - There are maybe 3 worthwhile NPCs in the whole game.\n2. Dialogue - The dialogue with the said 3 NPCs is sometimes strange and somewhat out of place.\n3. Replay value - Whereas I've played Darksouls I and II with multiple characters for months, After I finished this game, I'll probably finish it once more from the beginning this time trying to get all the collectables and the special weapons from the bosses. After that I'll probably delete the game never to play it again.\n4. Game duration - It's too short. It took me probably 15 hours to finish.\n5. "Samey" world design - Remember how in Darksouls you have very distinct and different environments? Well there's no such thing in Lords. The whole game is one big dungeon and castle interiors mixed with a bit of snowy exterior. It looks great but it's the same most of the game. And since it's all interconnected (something I like very much, reminds me of how Darksouls I handled it's world and shortcuts to bonefires) it results in being lost quite often, trying to find how to progress further into the game (something I hate very much).\n\nOverall Score: 6.5/10\nVerdict: Buy the game if you are a darksouls fan, but get it when it's on discount.","July 5, 2015","true","19.6"," 224 of 253 people (89%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","89","224","253","24","13"

I read through the entire review, and came to the conclusion that the guy didn't like the game, felt like he wasted $50 bucks, and decided to write his first review on a good game that he couldn't grasp around what it actually is, in oppose to what he wanted it to be, and it's turning away many people from it. I was almost one of them, but all I could read was someone complaining about everything that this game is suppose to be. So, I picked it up, I have logged 8 hours into it, and I think, personally, he was wrong, but those are his opinions.\n\n\nCombat & controls rant:\nThis game is great, and it has very fluid tight gameplay that beats that of the Souls series. And if you played the Souls games you'll feel at home with the controls for Lords. I'm currently playing as a brawler. So I'm heavily focused on heavy CQC. You got a heavy attack, light attack, parry, block, barrel roll, and all the cool stuff like catching the little ♥♥♥♥ in an epic attack animation by catching him from behind. Attacking is damn near perfect, and every weapon I have used so far holds its own weight, and requires you to change up your strategy because one heavy weapon might be heavier than the other, and that might prolong the hit giving the enemy more time to counter. The lighter the weapon, the faster the hit, but the cost is of course dealing less damage, but giving you more reaction time is always a positive. Blocking actually feels like blocking, and to my surprise blocking while two-handing a weapon isn't going to screw you over. The hitboxes are on point, and you aren't left questioning how you're caught on a hit even though you are not in the line of attack.\n\nMagic rant:\nThis game of course uses its share of magic, but I feel like it is a bit limited depending on the class you initialing picked. I am a brawler so I have four magic spells:\n\nPrayer: You bring out a clone to divert the enemies attention while restoring some health over time.\nRage: Gives you more attack power, and removes energy restrictions.\nRam: Unleash a strong charging force that damages, staggers, and can knock down enemies.\nQuake: Giant hammer that comes down and wrecks face.\n\nEach spell is very useful depending on the situation, and can really save your ♥♥♥. I don't really have much input on the spells really because I'm still on my first playthrough of the game, and this is as much as I currently know.\n\nCustomizing rant:\nThe customization in this game is great because it gives you an assorted list of good weapons and armors that you can actually use due to interest instead of picking up a bunch of useless gear to toss out later. It features armoring feet, hands, chest, and legs. Weapons are of course in variety such as swords, axes, fist weapons, polearms, hammers, etc. One thing to note is the equipping runes in your gear slots. Runes help in terms of boosting defenses against elements, or adding elements to weapon properties. It's pretty good when you add fire to your projectiles. Nothing beats some nice damage over time on ranged enemies.\n\nLeveling system rant:\nThe leveling system is the same as any Souls game, but with a twist. Gather experience to level up attribute points, or gain spell points, and if you die with the experience on you, you'll lose it all, but you can get it back by going back to where you died. The twist here is that the more experience you carry on you the better and more frequent the drops become in game from enemies. You also get on a killing streak experience multiplier if you hold on to your experience. The more enemies you kill, the more experience you get. When you die you have a matter of time to get to your experience to get the full value since it has a percentage timer that goes down the longer it takes you back to where you died. Really makes you question if you should use the experience before a boss fight.\n\nGraphics rant:\nThe graphics are great, and can be taxing on your computer, but so far I have everything set on high, and haven't run into much issues. I've gotten some framerate issues in areas heavy with particle effects like snowy areas, and encounter issues in tight corridor places as well, but they aren't game breaking, but they can be annoying. I turn down my settings to low when I stream on twitch, and the game still looks gorgeous. I love the PhsyX usage in the game. Some particle effects just make me cream everywhere. I currently run two Nvidia 680 4GB in SLI, i7-2700K, and 16GB RAM.\n\nSoundtrack rant:\nI've had some issues with character dialog cutting out here 'n there, and in some places the music gets super loud for no reason, and it'll go back to normal randomly. Aside from that the soundtrack is great, and it draws you into this gritty world. For some odd reason it reminds me of Diablo 2. I really can't break down soundtracks and music, so yeah. That's that.\n\nStory, characters, and enemies rant:\nThe story is lackluster so far. You play as Harkyn, a criminal who did a lot of bad ♥♥♥♥, and is looked down upon by everyone, but is freed by a monk who saw in him the ability to fight off the evil gods and their demons. That's as much as I know since I have yet to beat the game, but it's your typical story with a badass over-powered protagonist. But! I do love the characters in this game since they are so entertaining, and have their own unique humor, characteristic traits, and what not. The voice acting is pretty good though the lip-syncing is off. Enemy design is great and unique, the enemies all have their own characteristics that make them different from one 'n another, so it keeps it fun & challenging. One enemy will run at you with a constant barrage of attacks making you shield up, and go for the perfect backstap. Other enemies are a fortress of defense waiting for you to attack so they can parry, and wreck your ♥♥♥♥. The bosses are kinda repetitive in design, but hold their own challenge. I won't go far into depth on bosses because spoilers. If you are a master at these kind of games you will own them no problem, but with me I died a couple times trying to get down the right strategy.\n\nOutcome rant:\nThe game isn't punishing like Dark Souls which can be a good or a bad thing depending on who you are asking, but I think it is refreshing, and gives the new IP good ground to expand to something wonderful, and make this into a great series of games. I have fully enjoyed everything I have played of this game so far. I have played both Dark Souls, and Demon's Souls, and awaiting for Bloodborne. Huge fan of these kind of games, and this game fits in its genre as a little more casual, but definitely a lot of fun. I'd say give it a go. A solid 8/10 for me. I'm not much of a reviewer, but this game does justice. I just felt the need to say it.\n\nTL:DR~\n\nPros:\n+ Great fluid combat, and spot on hitboxes.\n+ Plenty of customizing and armory to fit your play style.\n+ Leveling is easy to learn and use, and holds its weight in deciding how your going to progress through the game.\n+ Graphics are splendid, and the world is gorgeous.\n+ Soundtrack is empowering.\n+ Majority of the enemies hold their own challenges, making you switch up your style of gameplay to put 'em down faster.\n+ Most of the characters I have met in the game are pretty funny. Humor is always nice in anything.\n\nCons:\n- The story is your typical save the world of mankind with a super strong buff dude who has to make up for his crimes.\n- Magic spells in this game can be useful, but overall they are pretty boring and can be forgotten.\n- Framerate issues here 'n there, but I'm sure this can be patched.\n- Character lip-syncing is way off, and it just looks silly.\n- Bosses are pretty repetitive.\n\n8/10","October 29, 2014","true","12.7"," 475 of 631 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","475","631","2","23"

For light armour for example, you get the best designed armour about half way through then get sets that seem much more 'vanilla' or are (I believe) reskins of previous sets.\n-The story isn't terrible, but I'm still unsure about the premise. Why exactly is Adyr the god considered a 'villain'? I may have missed an audio log that explains this, but then it is still missable.\n-There is a universal cooldown on spells, use one and they all go on cd (at least the ones from the same school do, can't verify whether it applies to other schools). On some combinations this may make sense, on others it seems overly restrictive. Keep in mind that without massive xp investment into faith (magic), the mana cost of each spell is likely prohibitive of chain casting anyway. Not impossible mind you, but when you factor in the cast time of each spell and the likelihood of interruption by enemy hits, a gcd seems superfluous.\n-Combat staggering seemed unpredictable across the board, both on you and the enemies. There seemed no way of knowing ahead of time whether Harkyn would get staggered by any given enemy's attacks or whether they would be staggered by his.\n-Certain classes may seem underpowered, mileage may vary. Rogue class definitely could have used some life steal baked in to a spell.\n-Majority of voice work is bland, not all but a lot of it.\n-The rune/crafting system seemed inconsistent. The game features a system where you can invest xp into locked runes  to increase the likelihood of better quality buffs but the return on this seemed very disappointing. Possibly rectified with better 'Luck' character stats but that's uncertain.\n\nThe bad:\n-The hit detection is suspect. Weapon strikes simply may decide not to land, spell hits may just not register.\n-Enemy projectiles may not hit you when they should and may seek you out through walls.\n-Equipment stats are confusing. You are given numbers without context. Conversely some items have only 'fluff' descriptions.\n-The camera may decide to snap to a completely obscured perspective during 'backstabs'.\n-Spell effects may also overwhelm your vision.\n-The gauntlet is intrusive and frequently redundant. It seemed underpowered no matter which class or loadout was used, an enemy could always be reached to melee them anyway, using it costs mana that would 9 times out of 10 be better used on spell casting and it is unalterably bound to the stance swapping button which gets in the way during combat.\n-The physics are unbelievable in a bad way. Enemies may do a U-turn mid leap, defying momentum. The enemy also has a bad habit of tracking your motion during weapon swings that would likely snap their bones, also rendering combat maneuvering futile. This becomes more of a problem with the more fragile classes.\n-Pathing is incompetent. Enemies may get stuck on corners or non existent obstacles, may reset and speed off to their original point (no, not that one demon dog who is scripted to do something similar).\n-Harkyn's magic is wildly unreliable. Magic may simply not do what it is supposed to. Direct damage spells may just not land despite hitting the mark. Buffs may drop off before their proper duration or not do as described. Bad pathing also applies here.\n-Even after hours of play time, the cumbersome nature of the spell casting can still be infuriating. Enemy AI is unreliable as to attacking during casting, they may knock you out of it or stand there and wait. A hit the wrong side of a millisecond may interrupt a 'complete' cast.\n-Controls are unreliable, Harkyn may simply ignore commands. The most frequent suspect for me was the running shield bash attack, it simply didn't happen about 40% of the time and would land Harkyn in hot water each time. Dodges may simply not occur either.\n-Saves may not be complete, by which I mean you can save your progress at a checkpoint or even move to a new area and quit and when you reload, the game may simply not have saved to that point. On a whim.\n-Desktop crashes. Frequent and exacerbated by the above problem.","June 24, 2015","false","56.6"," 228 of 288 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","228","288","6","6"

I’d love to recommend it, but it falls short of expectations.\n\nLotF is a game that (predictably) uses a combat system similar to that in the Souls games. You control Harkyn from the 3rd person perspective and probe enemies for patterns & weaknesses before moving in to finish them off using a weapon of your choice. There's a relatively large selection of weapons & armour to choose from, with the game slowly allowing you access to more powerful items as you continue with the linear narrative. The combat is functional and usually fun, but can be a little clunky at times, and the spells are often completely underwhelming and are more useful for tactical purposes. If you like to play RPGs as a mage then honestly you should probably avoid this game. You have access to one long range weapon which you can use in a variety of ways, but I found it most useful for pulling single enemies out of larger groups.\n\nThe game looks pretty good with a very consistent art-style, and the two major areas had very distinctive visual themes. The enemies were well designed and the environments were pretty, even if you could tell how constrictive they were. The armour designs were not to my taste (far too large and “showy”) and were a bit reminiscent of the kind of over-sized armour you see on space marines from 40k. The enemy animation was good enough for me to easily distinguish between what attacks they were winding up which allowed the combat to flow. The sound was not up to the same standard as the visuals: the scripting and voice acting in LotF are simply atrocious. Conversations often have sentences that don’t really follow on from the last, being said in tones that don’t follow the mood, on subjects you couldn’t care less about. The poor voice acting really impacts on the narrative too, as it is delivered in a very obvious and linear manner through conversations and cutscenes. The story simply plods along from A to B with few surprises. The audiobooks add meat to the narrative and are delivered with far more convincing speech than that from actual characters in the game, without them the story would have been paper-thin and completely forgettable (which is why so little of this review is dedicated to the story).\n\nI have a few more gripes about LotF as well. The biggest issue is that after finishing, not much changes in NG+ except that enemies have far more health, which really kills the replayability. My second largest issue is the scaling/levelling seems very oddly balanced: even when not using checkpoints for long periods of time to get extra XP, I rarely built up enough experience to increase Harkyn's capabilities in a noticeable manner; sometimes adding a point into Strength actually reduced the damage of my equipped Strength-scaling weapon and I have literally no idea why. Thirdly there are some technical problems: occasionally the game would outright crash, resulting in complete loss of everything you’ve done since last touching a checkpoint; the frame-rate would often bomb to unplayable levels; and sometimes the load times between areas would take unusually long.\n\nIt probably sounds like I’ve panned LotF, but I did manage to enjoy my time with it despite its failings. If you like 3rd person fantasy RPGs then this is worth the price of admission in a sale.","December 26, 2014","false","37.5"," 355 of 480 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","355","480","11","7"

A series defined by brutal difficulty, ambient storytelling and a constant sense of despair, fear, and loneliness; Lords of the Fallen set quite a high goal, and it’s sad that it seems they weren’t able to make it all the way there.\n\nThe story of Lords of the Fallen follows Harkyn, a gruff no-nonsense criminal released to defeat an invading enemy known as the Rhogar. Most of the game takes place in the Keystone Citadel, a vast castle set upon a snowy mountain at the peak of the world. The story seems ambiguous at first, with only mere mentions of Harkyn’s crimes and little backstory given other than the Rhogar seek to destroy humanity.\n\nThere are developments, a few twists and turns, but they ultimately amount to nothing. The world is fairly uninteresting, and little inspiration was taken from the Souls series in creating a world that makes you wonder why everything has fallen to ruin. I cared little for Harkyn, and even less for the characters in the game. There are a few NPCs scattered about and a couple sidequests to complete, but really, this is a game focused on combat first, story second.\n\nAs for the combat, it’s solid enough. You have a typical Souls control scheme, with light and heavy attacks, a dodge roll, a magic projectile-firing gauntlet, and the ability to two-hand or sword-and-board. Backstabbing is still the name of the game here, although the equipment and armor allow for a more tank-oriented player to hunker down instead of dodging and utilizing invincibility frames. Magic is also a tool at the player’s disposal, though the variety is rather interesting.\n\nThere are three trees of magic you select from at the start of the game, focusing on certain strengths. All three trees receive Prayer, which spawns a decoy that any enemy, bosses included, will blindly attack instead of Harkyn. I only ever found use in the Brawler tree, where the abilities seemed extremely overpowered. Ram is essentially a fireball that goes through enemy shields, Rage allows unfettered use of an unending pool of stamina, and Quake is just straight-up a lightning bolt that wrecks everything in eyesight. There’s really no room for subtlety or complexity in this magic system, a plus for some and a minus for others.\n\nTo be honest, most of the game’s combat feels much like the magic system: there is a sense of mind-numbing difficulty, but streamlined in order to not deter players who aren’t used to this sort of punishment. You’ll be challenged, but rarely punished. There’s a variety of approaches, whether you choose to strip off your armor and go fast and quick against the mightiest of bosses, or want to spam Ram on every minion in sight, and every strategy is viable.\n\nThe trade-off is that there is little of the depth or complexity that enraptured Souls fans in the past. There is little variety in weapons, outside of the addition of gauntlets. Gameplay is interesting, but you won’t see as many gimmick builds or min-maxing as you would in a Souls game. This is furthered by the fact there is no multiplayer in any form; the lack of invasion gameplay and one-on-one duels means that your primary means of perfecting combat is against minions and bosses.\n\nBosses are a major factor in any character action game, and even more-so in Lords of the Fallen. After facing encounter after encounter, your prowess and mettle is tested to the fullest by these monstrosities. The bosses are definitely special encounters, and stand out compared to the common fold of enemies. They’re difficult, and you’ll bang your head against the wall a few times trying to pass them.\n\nTo be frank, the bosses of Lords of the Fallen are just not memorable in the slightest. It doesn’t help that they’re given little to no backstory, and labeled simply as “Commander” or “Worshipper” or “Infiltrator.” Souls games often had memorable encounters, heightened by the lore leading up to them and given meaning by the events of the game; battles against titans like Sif, Gwyn and Artorias have meaning behind them, and are a culmination of the player’s actions. The Rhogar bosses feel arbitrary, as do the rest of the bosses in Lords of the Fallen. They act as an end goal, a finish line, but signify little more than that.\n\nLords of the Fallen can’t be painted over as simply a Souls copy, however. It does a few things to expand upon and innovate the mechanics of the pseudo-genre, and it does these well. The experience system of Lords is similar to the soul-collecting mechanic, where experience is earned from enemy kills and completing objectives, and dropped on the ground upon death.\n\nYou not only have to recover these after your respawn, but you only have a certain time-frame to do so. The experience will gradually decay after some time, and eventually disappear. You also gain experience multipliers and extra loot the longer you hold onto your experience, at the cost of potentially losing it. You can “bank” you experience at checkpoints, but even this has it’s own set of risks. You can apply experience towards either a point for your stats or a point for your magic. These mechanics create a constant risk-reward balancing act, and is very fulfilling. I often found myself questioning whether to bank my XP into that spell point I was aiming for, or potentially lose it all in an upcoming boss fight where I wouldn’t have a good opportunity to reclaim my points.\n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful on high-end PCs. Console versions suffer from framerate issues, but on the standard gaming computer, this game will run at a clean 1080p at 60 FPS. The kicker for PC users is that they should prepare to deal with a wealth of bugs and glitches. I had several game-breaking bugs, which lost me massive amounts of progress and several chunks of hair. Also, camera control is abysmal in most hallways and corridors. While you have control of the camera, the automatic pans and swings around for backstabs or dodges are really annoying to deal with while you’re managing a million other things on-screen.\n\nOverall, Lords of the Fallen captures the Souls essence in a base sense, and provides a nice entry point for those intimidated by the series’ infamous difficulty. Where it failed to capture its inspiration’s essence was in the lore and storytelling, both of which fall flat in Lords. This is an enjoyable romp through a series of difficult bosses, and it does a nice job of making you feel like you’ve grown from a measly warrior to unstoppable force by the end of the game. Just don’t expect the same depth that inspired the fanatical cult following of the Souls games.","February 9","true","69.8"," 78 of 98 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","78","98","5","2"

Not because the game is too difficult or too long but rather because of endless crashes.  My first save file was ruined by a death loop bug that rendered the file completely unusable.  I looked to see if there was a solution or if others had experienced it.  A few had and some even were able to get out of it by rolling their character immediately upon loading.  "OK" I thought, "It was only 10 hours on that file, no big deal."  Now on my second play through (after having twiddled with the settings per all the common temporary fix threads out there) I just can't play for more than 10 minutes without a crash.\n\nThis is particularly problematic in a game in which one of the core mechanics is gambling for bigger rewards by not saving your game.  This, in itself, is a fun mechanic- I like the idea of having to risk your progress in the game for incremental rewards.  It's clever and potentially fun.  This is undermined entirely by the reality that bugs and crashes incentivize me to save as often as possible.\n\nThere are good things about this game, a lot of them.  The art is amazing, the game feel is heavy in a visceral way that connects you to what you're doing.  I can't recommend it until it's been fixed, however.  I can't even play it.  With a GTX780 and similarly big specs throughout the rest of my rig, there's no excuse why these glitches, crashes, and bugs should exist.  This game was simply not tested thoroughly enough. I hope the developers will 1- fix the bugs asap and 2- learn their lesson so that their talents aren't overshadowed by sloppy mistakes.\n\nUpdate 1: I have pushed through to NG+ perhaps due to a desire to harm myself.\n\nUpdate 2: I'm looking forward to the new patch which promises to fix stability issues; I will expand my thoughts.\n\nUpdate 3: So far, so good.  Played for several hours without any stability issues.  Will get through NG+ before I decide to turn the frown upside down.  Clearly I'm enjoying the game a great deal or else I wouldn't be playing it.

Apparently, he is on a journey with another man traveling to a  monastery and has lost many men on the way. Only on arrival and opening the doors did they see that the monastery is completely empty and bodies' litter the entire room and demonlike enemies starts attacking....\n\nClassesThree discipline  type for magic: Deception, Brawling, and Solace of magic to choose from and three equipments type to start off, Cleric, Warrior, and a rogue type class.\nBrawling is focused on offensive magic. Solace is focused on more protective and healing while deception is focused more on more of a mix of imparing and debuffing enemies.\nVariety of spells seems limited in this game for all 3 tree has similar spells.\n\nControls\nThe various attacks that can be performed are  weak and strong attack, rolling, running, jumping, back stepping, parry, frontal kicks, and dodging. The invincibility frames, however, are completely different and more precise when evading. There is a Magic and a Stamina bar so running, attacking, or evading use stamina while magic of any sort from spells to the gauntlet uses the magic bar.\n\nThe initial layout for the controls is almost exactly the same as DS, if you know the controls, you'll understand this game right away. The only difference is the use of items and cycling it since it has to be favorite set or used from the inventory screen.\n\nWhen attacking you can chain combos with your weak and strong attacks, How hard you hold down an attack will cause it to use up more stamina so technically both your  strong attack have additional stronger attack. Included in attacks is also dual wielding or single weapons with both hands wields depending upon the weapon type. Later in the game players will discover a gauntlet weapon that will allow different type of attacks with spells such as range, aoes etc that uses magic. Runeslotting begins later on changing up items.\n\nThe keyboard controls are bindable and the default is really decently bound through for this. The gamepad layout is similar to DS.\n\nEnemiesEnemies in the game starting off are a bit unpredictable due to having various attack patterns and having the ability to swing in various radius and also turning around. Some enemies such as bosses will have numerous fighting patterns that switched up depending on how much you damaged them. Stealth dispatching of enemies exist if you walk up to them slowly. Don't always depend too  much on trying to attack or evading from behind because you can still get hit from enemies when they swing their weapons near your character and they respond really fast\n\nSome of the AI is really stupid. I have seen my character stealth past them right in the front just by walking and not a single reaction from their line of sight at all and being able to do a stealth attack to kill them.\n\nGameplay:\nAfter defeating  the first boss It seems that the points can be stored towards attributes or spells, Not storing can cause perma loss, but if you don't save or use your points  you can gain more experience and earn with higher kill streaks by playing on. Saving requires save shards nearby and going across the character development screen and where exp points can be banked. Upon dying players will have a limited time to gather their lost experience floating around that looks like a wisp which will need to be grabbed or you'll lose it.\nMost of the areas  of the game and map are open or enclosed  where enemies are plenty an ambush you along with  certain unique monsters hidden throughout that can cause your downfall so thread carefully, when enemies are encountered  lock on, swing and chain combos or your choice on bypassing them if you want. if you die or use a  save shard they will respawn most of the time. There\nare plenty of areas and chambers to explore.\nCombos are important for the play if one wants to master more damage and mastering them can be quite tough. Using your experience to upgrade your stats is also as important in order to do more combos, take more hits and gain more stats in surviving this world.\nDuring the story there will be certain choices players can take which are either evil or good. There are also dialogue options to help players better understand the story and situation at hand.\n\nStats in the game fall under strength, vit, faith, endurance, agility and luck\nStrength for str weapons and to carry heavier gear, vit for health and potion effects, faith for mp pool and weapon magic damage, endurance for carrying more and stamina, agility for damage with fast weapons and energy, and luck for better items from enemies along with crafting material finds.\n\nThere are also three types of armor in the game, Light medium and heavy, which affects your character in variety of ways with your stamina and movemen and def. Most equips found are part of set until next playthrough\n\nThe maps are dark but extremely detailed with destructible about such as barrels, book cases, benches, etc. with  decent physics. There are potions,chests, portals and  items hidden throughout and audio scrolls that tells the story of the game.\n\nGraphics Looks amazing and well done, graphics are gorgeous and really detailed, many destructible all over the environment. Game runs at 30 fps for me for some reason. Trying to push or uncap for more. The interface is completely different in the inventory though and seems more sleek and clean. The game lighting is great, and the effects are top notch. The art reminds me of warhammer and the enemies   bodyparts/armor chips away as you fight them. The animations are seriously well done though sometimes I notice my rogue doing some really weird glitch through on attacks and hopefully that's a bug that can be fixed.\n\nOpinion?Game is awsome so far and borrows from DS well and DS borrows from Monster hunter well, Ds didn't invent the manual camera control style combat folks I've got games predating before DS.\nI also like the precision of hit boxes though it can be wonky at times, the challenges and boss fight  to this game along with the immersive  graphics, Movement feel so fluid with the character, though more work needs to be done to iron out the bugs. Many are going to compare this to dark souls because it's very similar with the camera style and controls, but yet it's different in mechanics  especailly enemy targetting. The game is ok overall and difficulty starting off seems really hard as a rogue class as in omg i am getting my face ripped.\n\nPros so far+ Graphics looks amazing and really detailed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tokamouflage/recommended/265300/","tokamouflage","Crestfallen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tokamouflage/","284 products in account","First of all, I really wanted to like that game, but it made it more and more impossible the more I played.\n\nFrom the beginning to the second boss, I enjoyed the game and thought it is a nice souls clone. But after that I started to notice issues that annoyed me the more I played.\nFirst, the enemies. While they are not really hard, there are enemies that take minutes to beat just because they are behind a tower shield. That would be no big problem, if your shield break and/or kick could shove the shield aside to make it possible for you to hit them. That won't work. Only thing that works is running shield bash, and even with that it takes way too long to kill them. The most stupid thing is that the enemies with the big shields have an shield bash + sword slash attack that is faster than anything you could do, even the light class + dagger doesn't offer that. Also, hitting enemies with big weapons doesn't seem to stagger them. There are unarmored crossbow wielding enemies that keep firing arrows at you while you hit them with a freakin'  hammer that has an attack animation of a train... The enemies are all very similar. The mutant knights you fought at the start keep appearing through the game with just more health and damage. That is true for all enemies.\n\nNext, the boss fights. I haven't finished the game yet, but what i have seen already makes me sad. The bosses are really easy, because they have 3-5 types of attack they repeat. A LotF boss battle follows always the same pattern. Get away when they do attack a, b or c. Roll away from attack d and attack for 1/1000 damage to their health bar. Repeat 10-20 minutes, you win. :(\n\nThe area is relatively small and feels uninspired. At first sight, the game looks awesome and it does really have nice graphics. But later it is just repetitive and uninspired somehow. Also, after the second boss you don't know where to go. I went everywhere, beat the big shield guys near the back entrance and gone through the graveyard to the "catacombs". The NPC weren't at the place he supposed to be to let me into the other dimension/world. After I got out there i where supposed to go through the catacombs again. Also, catacombs is no area name but is the quest location. Confusing. Levers and that kind of stuff is hard to make out from the background of rubbish and debris.\n\nThe checkpoint system makes the game unnecessarily easy. The enemies only respawn after you die, so you can replenish your health and vials infinitely while progressing through the area. While the bonus exp system is there to balance that, it doesn't work. The bonus is just not enough to make it worth to "gamble" for it with less healing.\n\nThe character development and crafting is very disappointing. You choose one of three classes and then stay with 4 more or less useful spells. Crafting is not existent. There are runes you can put in some of your weapons and armor, but they are only a few and not really interesting or game changing in any meaning. Also, you do get the ability to put runes into your stuff only after the second boss. ... if you found the right way directly. A little bit late for my taste.\n\nThe story and NPCs are not overwhelming but also not bad. Standard mediocre medieval monster stuff. Nothing impressing or interesting.\n\nThe whole game feels slow. Really slow. Take Dark souls and make it 3 times slower. I don't see any gain from that. I want slow attack speed with ultra greatswords but not with small axes. Also, fast roll feels slow. Moving is slow, magic and shooting is slow. Not really fun to play like that. Souls gave you options, LotF gives you nearly nothing. Of course there are differences between light and heavy armor, but it's just too little in my opinion.\n\nThe controls are badly programmed. Locked on an enemy, rolling/stepping backwards just seems to be a lucky occurrence. If you press back and are just one millimeter of to one side your character roles left or right not backwards. While the enemies even turn 360` with their hardest attack, you get hit all the time. It felt for me that there is nor invincible frame with rolling, too. The lock-on is clumsy and sometimes just annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\n\nConclusion\n*First impression is nice, later gets boring/repetitive\n*Bad enemy and boss design, not hard but time consuming boring battles\n*Too easy checkpoint system\n*Character/Skill development nearly not existent\n*No crafting, only runes with small impact\n*Area small/repetitive design, way not clear/confusing\n*Story nothing special\n*Everything is slow, turtle on dope in gelatinous mass slow\n*Controls sometimes not direct/on the point\n*Nice graphics and sound design\n*If you liked souls series, do not expect something similar good from this game. Only buy at high discount!\n\nI give it 65 out of 100\n\nSide note: I played the game with maximum graphics fluidly and with a controller.","March 29, 2015","false","8.2"," 109 of 150 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","109","150","8","1"

Gotta admit, initially I was positively surprised by how "Dark Souls" it actually felt. A lot of the base mechanics from the Souls-games have an almost exact equivalent in Lords of the Fallen, the control-scheme is exactly the same.\n\nI guess that is the reason I liked it at first, it felt like coming home. That some german developers actually managed to clone From Softwares masterpieces this well was impressive, too. Especially since Germany has a history of royally screwing up combat systems - I am just gonna drop Gothic or Risen as examples of laughably bad and awful combat. So, being this close to having an enjoyable fighting engine is a feat.\n\nMy positive impressions started to crumble away when I realized how limited the game was in scope, and how it lacked all the detail and tidbits that make the Souls-games such massive successes.\n\nThe world of Lords of the Fallen is incredibly small - and it suffers from being the most uninspired place I can think of. From the top of my head I can name you several areas from any Souls game that are very distinct and unlike anything else in the games they appear in - Lords is basically a bunch of Castlewalls, some dungeon-area and the "Chaoswastes" mountain-fortress. It starts to feel samey rather quickly - there is one vista that sticks out, the rest is bland. To make matters worse, I found it hard to navigate the areas, running past corridors or crossroads because everything looks the same. And as someone decided it was cool to litter each place with as much junk and debris as possible, making it easy to miss levers, doors and whatnot. There is just not enough "contrast" between the various areas, there is not enough play with open and enclosed areas and most importantly nothing really sticks with you - most rooms are plain exchangeable. Remember when you first set eyes on Anor Londo bathed in golden sunlight after braving the many traps of dark and gloomy Sen's Fortress or the fascinating moment of discovering Ashlake beyond the great hollow tree - nothing like that in Lords of the Fallen, the locales are simply boring and unexciting.\n\nEnemies are dull as well, and I sure hope you enjoy killing off dozens of Chaos Warriors because that is what you get. See, I am not even that opposed to the whole Warhammer-aesthetic this game got going (eventhough it is incredibly blatant at times, I am looking at you "great unclean one") - but even the smallest zone in any Souls game has more variety than Lords of the Fallen as a whole. Not only are the designs kind of boring, the attack patterns are too.\n\nAnd that is my cue to talk about the real gamebreaker in my opinion: combat, attack patterns and weapons have massive balance issues and get frustrating REALLY fast. See, a big deal about Souls-games is finding different weapons and experimenting with their various upgrade paths as well as figuring their move-sets out. Lords dropped that entirely. Ocassionally you find a weapon that has sockets, which can be outfitted with a +X something rune, but that is it. The weapons do scale with your stats, but the percentage is so low that it hardly matters. You need some really ridiculous amount of level ups to see some serious change. Then there is the matter of lacking any interesting moves - I have tried a bunch of different weapons and I could hardly tell a difference in how they are used. Souls, while exaggerating move-sets, seemed to be somewhat based on reality. Lords is just a flailing contest and looks incredibly silly at times. They really screwed with timings too. Particularly on the heavy weapons. So, you found that massive two-handed axe - well, Buster - the jokes on you, because you won't be able to properly use it in a battle anytime soon. Why? Well, because no matter how strong you are, the "heavy" attacks take FOREVER to wind up (and by the looks of it, it is just the quick attack animation played at half-speed - which looks like ♥♥♥♥). Your best bet is something fast and reliable (at the cost of damage) because enemies will stagger you aplenty - no matter the poise of your amour. Also, the timeframes for counter attacks are incredibly small, so even if you manage to stagger an enemy or see an opening in their defense, by the time our hero Harkyn managed to swing those ugly-looking war-paddles the enemy is back on his feet shoving that big old towershield of his into your face. As a bonus: all enemies seemingly do their cardio on a regular basis and have incredibly amounts of stamina but are also lightning fast which results in the aforementioned stagger-thon.\n\nAt first it was just tedious, but that changed to frustrating in the final bits of Lords when they just throw everything at you and the game becomes a whack 'em all. Dark Souls combat had grace, elegance and style - Lords just doesn't have that depth and variety. It also doesn't have the vast amounts of different weapons you might have expected to see and with everything feeling somewhat the same, basically just differing in the amount of how much it pisses you off to get an attack going, I can't help but feel they wasted massive amounts of potential here.\n\nWith combat becoming tedious my motivation to go another round on new game plus is at sub zero - it also did not help that in the final hours I got the crashes too. The performance of the game was better for me pre-patch, and with an inconsistent framerate this is even harder to play than it already is, because you never know wether or not inputs have been properly registered so you tend to press a button more than needed which in bad case scenarios leads to you opening up and eating damage.\n\nThe game isn't all bad, and I guess it's a solid attempt at copying the Souls experience - though the result isn't exactly the amazing clone I had hoped for. Particularly the combat just feels broken to me, though it had potential - but with the balancing getting thrown out of the window at the first half I just didn't enjoy the game as much as I hoped I would.\n\nGood idea, mediocre execution - but these guys do have potential. If you absolutely need something Souls-like and cannot wait for Bloodborne - this might be worth a shot. In a sale. When it is patched to be stable.  And if you are a hardcore-fan of the Souls-games this might be worth it to see what they got right and where the failed miserably. But, ultimately I feel like you could skip this game and don't miss out (not even for story-reasons, unless you like your fantasy clichéd and predictable - but then again, clichéd and predictable fits the bland world and it's Warhammer-dropouts).","November 1, 2014","false","13.2"," 342 of 522 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","342","522","2","60"

Apparently was riddled with bugs when released (lots of crashing, poorly optimised), but I had no problems running it on high settings with a modest mid-range rig (i5 3570k, AMD 7870, 8GB RAM). It also gets compared to Dark Souls a lot, and rightly so, but I don't think any game should be negatively reviewed for being 'not as good as Dark Souls', as that's a pretty high bar. So without further ado, lets dive right in and compare it directly to Dark Souls!\n\nSimilar to Souls:\nCheckpoint system, red floating crystals instead of bonfires. Replenish HP / MP / potions, enemies respawn.\nMelee combat mechanics - parry (only with subset of shields), backstabs, stamina management, dodgerolls, staggering, light attack, heavy attack, running attack etc. Similar range of weapons. % Equipment load determines movement and dodgeroll speed. 'Weighty' feel to larger weapons.\nWeapons (but not armour) have stat requirements. Some weapons scale with their relevant stat.\nLoot - set loot gained through chests, enemies have a chance of dropping 'runes' (for upgrades) or equipment (rare). No duplicate armour / weapons.\nLevel design - sprawling areas that loop back into each other by unlocking shortcuts. Lots of secret items and areas.\nLeveling - bank experience at checkpoints to level up attributes / spells, each subsequent level requires more.\nUpon death your exp is left as a 'ghost' with a timer on it, or until your next death.\nNG+ and NG++ for multiple playthroughs.\nDecimate furniture by rolling into it\nDifferent from Souls\nNo fast travel from checkpoint to checkpoint, not a massive problem because;\nSmaller world, fast traveling would have been nice at times, but overall not a big problem.\nShorter game, could be finished in maybe 8 hours if you don't explore much. Personally it took me around 15 hours.\nNo invincibility during dodgeroll that I am aware of. Causes some moments of anger if you're used to Dark Souls, but you get used to it.\nMagic - each class (warrior, thief, cleric) has a set of 4 spells that can be unlocked and leveled up at checkpoints, separately from attribute points. There is also a gauntlet that has 3 modes of fire (basically different ranges), which gains power with more Faith (cleric / magic build). Both share an MP pool.\nMuch more straightforward story, quite typical dark fantasy stuff, not too abstract or anything.\nEquipment upgrading is done through a 'rune' system - you gain sealed runes from defeating enemies, and unlock them to reveal type (eg power / fire / luck), runes range from 'lesser' to 'flawless' and can be attached and detached at will from equipment that has slots.\nNo multiplayer aspect\nOther notes: The game looks great - dark atmosphere, good enemy/boss design, weapons / armour look suitably fantasy, so you get that extra bit of satisfaction from new gear. The melee combat is heavily emphasised, ranged combat is minimal (pretty much limited to gauntlet). Many weapon types have very slow attack speed, which can take a bit of getting used to, but there are claws and daggers for faster attacks (this is how I played) which are perfectly viable. It is not as big or complex as Dark Souls, but still holds it's own as a solid Action-RPG with dark fantasy flavour, good melee combat, and some side quests and extra exploration encouraged to flesh out the experience.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed my time playing Lords of the Fallen, and seeing as you can get it for disgustingly cheap when it's on sale these days, I don't see why you shouldn't pick it up.","April 18","true","26.7"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/265300/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","(TL;DR? This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)\n\nWith the recent success of the Souls franchise and its emphasis on precision timed combat and high difficulty it was only a matter of time before imitators would listen to the herald of success.  Lords of the Fallen brings its own take on the punishing hack n slash genre.  While there's no hiding its influence from Dark Souls, it doesn't manage to improve the formula enough to justify its own existence.\n\nThe differences between the two titles will be immediately apparent.  You'll be moved throughout the game through a much more direct plot than the subtle nuanced on-goings of the Souls games.  You play as Harkyn, a prisoner released by Kaslo, to hold off an invasion from the imposing forces of Rhogar who are subverting the natural order of things in his world.  The story is rather empty and predictable for the most part and is told through clumsy character animations with flat voice acting.  It manages to do little else other than keep things moving along through the 12-20 hour campaign.\n\nThe visuals are solid for the most part and offer well lit, moody environments to explore.  Initially, the world feels large and expansive with a host of optional areas to explore but you'll soon come to realize most of these areas will require you to delve into them at one point or another throughout the story, making the interconnected albeit small castle that you spend the majority of the game in feel limited.  There isn't a huge variety in locations either as you'll generally be exploring the snowy exterior of the citadel or its gloomy interior.  The whole thing feels pretty underwhelming by the time you finish it all.\n\nGame play is very similar to the sword and board melee combat of Dark Souls but with a much more limited assortment of spells available to its three classes.  You'll also be welcomed with a large pool of life, a recharging mana bar, and a steady supply of healing potions that make the encounters considerably easier than its counterpart.  Bosses are intended to offer unique fights but by the end of the game you can overcome some of the more difficult bosses by simply buffing yourself with magic and pulverizing the boss to death before they can inflict enough damage back to offset your relentless assault.  The camera can also be a bit irritating as your battles can be hidden by hanging banners and other furniture with dips in the frame rate being commonplace. Enemies also tend to offer little variety with only around a dozen types with the shielded ones being the most annoying to fight since they rely on blocking a little too much causing conflicts with them to become prolonged and irritating.  All of that being said though, while not meeting the standard that Dark Souls met and being a little slower, it still manages to be competent enough to enjoy the game's short duration.\n\nThe items that you acquire are all well designed and offer a much flashier aesthetic than what you'll find with most of the armor and weapons in the Souls games.  While you can upgrade gear and items with its rune system, you'll be frequently re-socketing pieces as replacements since upgrades will come frequently.  The soundtrack holds its own but doesn't manage to leave any lasting impression as is a common theme with the game.\n\nOne of the cooler aspects of Lords is the risk/reward mechanic behind its gameplay that rewards you for holding onto a larger amount of experience that can be cashed in with a multiplier that rises with each enemy killed, although it unfortunately only caps at 2.  You'll also be urged to return to your body quickly as the amount of experience you regain is based on the speed at which you reclaim your corpse.  Although the lack of overall difficulty in this compared to Dark Souls trivialized this aspect a bit as I was always able to run by enemies and regain my corpse quickly on the few occasions that I died.  Upon completing this game you'll be rewarded with a New Game + option that raises the difficulty and unlocks more spell trees but that's if you're able to get to the end which leads to Lords of the Fallen's biggest problem, game breaking bugs.\n\nWhile clearing out the missed collectables and locked doors throughout the world that I hadn't gone back yet to open just before the final boss I fell down a hole which killed my character.  Instead of respawning at my last visited checkpoint, the game quick saved and spawned me at the bottom of the hole which I was unable to escape from, or reload a previous save.  So with that, I had gone as far as I could without restarting the game on a new save file and playing through the entire game again to finish the final act.  Glitches like this are inexcusable in a finished product and should've been tested out before release.  Luckily, I wasn't too wrapped up in the story to care that much of whether or not I saw the end.\n\nLords of the Fallen manages to feel like Dark Souls Lite, it offers similar but simpler, slower combat.  An interconnected but small world when compared to vistas like Lordran, and a risk/reward system with little actual risk.  In addition to all this it lacks any of the creative multiplayer features found in the Souls games.  If you're looking for something to hold you over until Bloodborne, Lords of the Fallen offers a strong initial impression that can scratch that itch for a very brief period of time.  Just be sure to watch your step and go into it with much lower expectations.\n\n\nThis review is also available in video format:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hONZT8hmPXc\n\n\nPros\n\n+ Solid yet borrowed combat\n+ Makes a strong first impression but loses momentum quickly\n+ Good soundtrack\n\nCons\n\n- Game Breaking Bugs\n- Short length compared to Dark Souls\n- Linear with the 'optional areas' not being optional.\n- Does nothing original\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","November 6, 2014","false","11.2"," 154 of 231 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","154","231","0","8"

It takes a number of keys from the souls series and builds on it in it own way. While its not as hard as Dark souls 1 its still got some challenge too it. Right after fighting the 2nd boss its ramps up and gets a bit harder, not by much but it's still noticable. While at the time (10/29/2014) the game has a number of bugs and fps probelms its still pretty good to play. In its current state (10/29/2014) I would give it 7.5/10, however once its bugs get patched and sorted out it will be a solid 9/10.","October 29, 2014","true","25.6"," 106 of 157 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","106","157","0","0"

Being a big fan of the Souls games, I was looking forward to some Souls-esque but-without-getting-stomped-by-overpowerd-invasions fun.  But dang, Harken was slow and seemed to spend about 10 seconds winding up his attacks before actually throwing them, and I quickly grew bored of this game and its unresponsive controls.  So, my first review was rather scathing, and lo many a fan boy/girl posted some rather immature and insulting comments, most of which have been deleted.  I’m a stoopid noob and I should go back to candy crush saga, apparently.  I also need to 'git gud' even though the difficulty of this game (which isn't much) was never an issue...\n\nBeing a cheapskate and wanting to get my money’s worth out of the game, I forced myself to complete.  And you know what?  LOTF is not a bad game.  I might even have enjoyed it a wee bit.  But I would not recommend this game unless it is on sale – because there are much better games (i.e. Dark Souls) which do everything LOTF does only much better.\n\nStill, LOTF is bloody gorgeous, looking like Todd Macfarlane and Warhammer Fantasy got together to make a Cannibal Corpse album cover.  The armour and weapon designs are so ludicrously spikey and evil that I want to break out my old Slayer albums.  Sound is also great, with satisfying clunks and crashes giving combat a satisfying feel.  The bosses are super cool too.  I also particularly liked the system up upgrading weapons and armour with runes, which is very simple but kinda nice anyway.\n\nHowever, I found the controls to feel really unresponsive.  No matter what class you play as, there’s a significant lag between actually hitting the attack button and Harken swinging whatever oversized spike metal thingy he is carrying.  It lead me to a lot of frustration, as I signed in vain while the enemy would rush off for a cup of tea, do the washing, then come back and put their shield up in the time it takes Harken to wind up his attack.  Second, the game is not really challenging, and it doesn’t have difficulty settings.  Most enemies can be overpowered just by circling endlessly and button mashing, and many of the bosses can be easily beaten on first try once their attack pattern has been seen a few times.  I understand that NG+ is more of a challenge, but I’d already lost interest by then.\n\nIn summary, my opinion, which you don’t have to agree with, is that LOTF is an ok Dark Souls-lite game, but I wouldn’t recommend it because Dark Souls, even Dark Souls 2, does EVERYTHING infinitely better aside from graphics.  Furthermore, if I’m in the mood for some fantasy hack and slash and I’m not in the mood for Dark Souls, I’d play Devil May Cry, Darksiders 2, Dragons Dogma, Revengence or something long before I’d go for LOTF.  but hey there seems to be a lot of ppl who really loved this...what does a stoopid noob like me know anyway? git gud or go home...\n\nEdit - Now that Dark Souls 3 is out there is no need to even contemplate this game.  Or go with Salt and Sanctuary if your a 2d indie hispter - that said, if they make a sequel i'd give it a look as, if they got the gameplay right, this could easily be the Slayer album cover made flesh the never-dying 12 year old inside me is always looking for.","November 29, 2015","false","21.0"," 280 of 450 people (62%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","62","280","450","33","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/265300/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","It's pretty hard to launch an all-new triple-A game nowadays due to the huge risk, the adversity towards it by the current video games industry, as well as the pretty finicky nature of actual players, who might judge things a bit too harsh.\n\nEven so, Polish studio CI Games, formerly known for the Sniper: Ghost Warrior titles, together with German developer Deck13 Interactive, decided to bite the bullet and roll out Lords of the Fallen, a brand new role-playing game that features big characters, huge monsters, and tough combat, not to mention some pretty impressive visuals.\n\nLords of the Fallen follows the adventures of Harkyn, a prisoner whose crimes are written on his face. While the world is busy finding ways to vanquish all evil, an ancient god awakens and sends his Rhogar Lords to destroy it. As you can imagine, Harkyn is apparently the only man fit to go up against those demonic legions so he, together with mentor Kaslo, go on an epic quest to stop them from crushing the world. They get to explore a fair amount of environments and interact with different characters. Unfortunately, while you can make quite a few choices along the way, many don't have consequences and quite a few of the supporting cast members either use stereotype attitudes or are undeveloped. Plot moments are kept to a minimum and cut scenes do a decent job making things clear, without wasting time on things that don't immediately matter to the player. The world of the game gets fleshed out a bit more thanks to the audio diaries, but not many players will actually pay attention, which is a shame, as Deck13 and CI have done a great job in terms of world building.\n\nLords of the Fallen tries to combine the traditional role-playing mechanics with those seen in hack and slash titles, delivering a result that works pretty well. Harkyn isn't remotely as agile as Devil May Cry's Dante, but his moves are pretty swift and his blows pack quite a punch, depending on the equipped weapon type. You can pick between three classes – Warrior, Cleric, and Rogue. Each has its own magic category, relying on spells to buff survivability and damage for the warrior, healing and enemy manipulation for the cleric, or stealth and critical hits for the rogue. Leveling allows you to spend points in either the stats category, thereby boosting your health pool, your damage, and other such things, or the magic one, where you can unlock new spells to unleash, depending on your available Faith level. The combat relies on regular and heavy attacks, with the beefier ones requiring a few moments of build up before they're ready to go. Without a doubt, fans of the Souls games made by From Software will feel right at home, but there are quite a few more elements added on top to draw in more people.\n\nAmong them is the XP multiplier system. Each kill results in Harkyn getting more experience. When you reach the bonfire-like checkpoint, you can opt to use those points, thereby losing your multiplier, or you can keep going and see it increase exponentially. This high-risk, high-reward system is quite good, and if you die, you have a set amount of time to get back to your XP pile before it vanishes forever. The loot system is quite well done, and besides offering better and better armor or weapons, it also allows players to collect runes that can be used to provide great bonuses to your existing gear. These can often make or break a tough battle, so spending some time to analyze their pros and cons is essential. Unfortunately, you need to wait until you get to an NPC that can unlock the runes, so at least in the beginning you can only open certain chests with them.\n\nThe environments look quite impressive, but they don't vary all that much, as you'll often be fighting through ruined castles or snowy areas. The world of Lords of the Fallen certainly looks amazing but it's not explored all that much. What's more, the lack of a map or at least a semblance of a waypoint system means that you might end up going down wrong paths filled with enemies only to encounter closed doors and other such things. Thankfully, the enemy variety is quite solid, with a decent amount of monsters wielding different weapons, spells, and attacks going up against Harkyn during the campaign. Some of the Rhogar Lords require quite a bit of out-of-the-box thinking, but sufficiently leveling up certain skills, especially on the warrior, make a few of them die rather easily.\n\nOf course, like in Dark Souls, the difficulty, at least in the beginning, is grueling, so expect plenty of deaths and other such things. Unfortunately, until you start leveling up your attributes and spells, you'll have a really tough time, especially when you go up against enemies that know when to use their shields. Some of their attack patterns are also erratic, so don't be fooled into thinking you've memorized their moves. Enemies are also quite agile, and in some cases, this exposes a few problems with hit and collision detection. Speaking of problems, you'll also find that there are no difficulty options. This means that experienced RPG fans might soon feel like their version of Harkyn becomes a bit too powerful towards the end stages of the game. There is a New Game + option that buffs difficulty but also allows your character to unlock a second type of magic spells from another class, so things get even easier if you make smart choices.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, at least right now, the game is quite unstable on the PC platform. It crashes in all sorts of moments and the framerate spikes when transitioning from inside areas to exterior ones. Enemies will sometimes freeze in place, and if you attack them, they'll immediately fight back in a flurry of frenzied blows.\n\nLords of the Fallen is a gorgeous experience in terms of visuals, delivering realistic graphics but with plenty of rich colors. Provided your computer can run it, turning on all the different effects makes the whole experience look even better. Character models are sharp and textures look amazing in quite a few situations, although in some things get blurry. Animations, unfortunately, are a bit erratic, especially when characters talk to one another, as they flinch and gesticulate even when they deliver regular sentences. Also, expect a lot of clipping when it comes to your character's cloak and shield.\n\nLords of the Fallen is a decent role-playing experience with some innovative features but it's weighed down by the balancing problems and the technical issues. After a few updates, it might become a good and challenging RPG, but for now, it falls short. It is still very much worth playing, so don't hesitate to pick this up on a sale.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 27, 2014","true","28.2"," 75 of 110 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","75","110","2","1"

IIRC, the First Warden on NG+ hit me for like 8 damage in full heavy armor. On NG++ he hit me for 12. I played a bit further and noticed a very sharp increase in damage from certain monsters in the first area of the game; so yeah, the difficulty technically increases.\n\nThe shame is that it took so long to get this way. The gameworld is quite small once you run through it once and that "newness" feeling wears off. Its cramped, short and leaves me wanting.\n\nLords of the Fallen is a decent games with Dark Souls mechanics, but after the first playthrough the game loses its drive very quickly. 7/10 is the best I could rate this game, especially with this crashes that I have also fallen victim too.\n\nBottom line;\n\n+Great graphics\n+Dark Souls mechanics...ish\n+decent story and voice acting\n+has a feeling of drawing you in; presentation and atmosphere is well-done.\n+music is fantastic\n++catacombs area is perhaps the best area in the game.\n+cloth/cape mechanics are the best I have EVER seen in a game. I totally wish DS has this type of technology as well as other RPGS\n\n-relatively short. I finished the first run in 11-12 hours. NG+ was perhaps the same if not quicker because I was very powerful.\n-Feels cramped and the world is not nearly as large as the impression gives you. In ratio size, the game world is probably 1/3 of the DS series; that includes anyone of the games.\n-difficulty feels like its wildly overtuned on certain mobs while rediculously undertuned on certain bosses\n-less variety of monsters as one would expect\n-magic itself is remarkably similar to itself; all spells utilize a flaming avatar to accomplish what the spell would give you. Feels too generic and similar and "Mimic" was downright frustrating.\n-underwhelming crafting system. +/- defense in an element and/or attribute scaling and one would have hoped that putting a "Fire Rune" onto my weapon would make it burst into flames and set enemies on fire; nope. Only truly useful rune was the the attribute scaling one which doubled my 2h output to be able to put out enough DPS to kill the final boss on NG+ after over 12 attempts.\n-NG+ = shards for loot or you pick up any armor from the chests that you missed on your first playthrough. Incredibly boring\n-I genuinely expect to continue to progress my character throughout ALL playthroughs and leveling up my character in NG+ was a damn grind and chore beyond what I would have expected.\n\nI expected more. I bought into the hype and the game failed to meet my expectations. Im an experienced gamer. Ive been playing games through my days ever since NES. Im no stranger to game mechanics and progression.\n\nGet it if you want it, but dont expect to be floored unless you have low expectations and standards. I wish I would have waited for sale.\n\nUPDATE-2(Slight Spoilerish);;\n\nFrom what I have read playing as a warrior is generally considered to be the easiest form of play. This is using a shield and possibly a 2-handed weapon. I use this setup. I decided to jump back in and play a bit more on NG+. I have reached the Citadel and have noticed a large jump in damage to my character. I am using the heaviest set of armor with the best defense stats and a tyrant in the graveyard nearly one-shotted me with his overhead swing. It was a genuine "WTF" moment.\n\nNeedless to say that I was quite suprised. I continued playing a bit more and noticed sharp rises of damage intake during set points. The catacombs boss proved an interesting challenge as he hit quite a bit harder which is something I was not used to. I actually died on the giant boss that you eventually meet in the area of the three statutes. He hit quite hard.\n\nI am not picking up anymore armor on NG+ which leads me to believe that because my defense stats will generally not improve except whenever I mod them fully with runes that I have picked up throughout the game and because the damage intake is steadily and sometimes sharping increasing as I get towards end-game sections; I do feel that perhaps NG++ will truly be where the actual difficulty lies that people most want concerning this game.\n\nIts a matter of deduction based on the information available. This is with the best defense AND without using spells. As such, I am now actually looking forward to NG++ to see just how punishing this game truly is.\n\nAlso, because of the high defense given by heavy armor...this means that medium and light armor wearers will face significantly more damage and possibly one-shots on several abilities given by several mobs. This is not considering any defensive advantages given by the magic system in this game. It is purely utilizing armor and weapons.\n\nI have currently 13 potion slots and I find myself using them more and more. That is a good sign. I will update when I finally experience NG++\n\n\nUPDATE;\n\nAfter playing through NG+ to the halfway to 75% point I must say that I have to change my review to being recommended only if your dead set on getting a game that is similar to the DS series or waiting for a sale or unless your out-right starved for something new and exciting.\n\nUnless you enjoy the story and are set on keeping the same playthrough running as much as you can then you will not find hardly anything at all to keep you engaged with the game after beating it the first time...unless you want to make different choices to affect the ending slides; but you could just watch youtube, right?\n\nI saw the vids on youtube and even the tips during the loading screen. They said you will get new loot and stuff on subsequent playthroughs. The only thing that I have noticed are new lore drops specifically in the regions on normal that were not there but were then there on NG+\n\nAs with regards to armor/weapons? I did pick up a light armor set which seems to be the rogue counterpart to the last heavy armor set I picked up for warriors. I could have missed it on my first playthrough, however, so this isnt saying much. I went through this entire experience of NG picking up shards 95-99% of the time. Very underwhelming.\n\nMy thoughts are that what was promoted is not what was essentially delivered to a satisfying context.\n\nIm disappointed. The combat is good, but I feel that long-lasting value is lacking to this game and that is a damn shame.\n\nFor the first playthrough, however, it was a blast.","October 29, 2014","true","39.9"," 77 of 115 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","77","115","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KennyStarkiller/recommended/265300/","KennyStarkiller","Severen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KennyStarkiller/","140 products in account","UPDATE: beaten the game and all opinions below still apply, honestly (I was about 8 hours in when i wrote this impression). I can say that if you don't like Demons/Dark Souls, you will more than likely doubly-dislike this game. So just to get that right out in front, don't look for this game to change your opinion on the Souls-style gaming, because it wont.\n\n\nNow to people who are looking for a Souls-like experience, in my honest opinion, you should NOT get your hopes up. While the game has an overall Souls feel when it comes to combat, as Lords of the Fallen (LotF from this point on) seems to borrow VERY heavily from the game, it's about as far from Souls-FEELING as it could be given how closely the mechanics work.\n\n\nThe game- is SLOW. Like, "snail trudging through molasses in winter-time" slow. In every aspect that a game can be considered slow, LotF is. Player movement is slow, attack animations are slow, roll speed is slow, gauntlet attacks are slow, spell startups are slow- hell even the story is slow, but I'll talk about that later.\n\n\nIf you go into this game thinking you're going to play it like anything other than that fat-rolliest heavy armored monster-weapon-wielding tank in Dark Souls, then you're going in with expectations far exceeding what the game allows. Unfortunately, it seems that many of the enemies and a few of SOME enemies attacks seem to be designed entirely around blocking the hit and then countering after their animation is done- which is fine for the most part, but when LotF advertises dual-wielding fast weapons and light armor with the option to dodge roll away from enemies, it's NOT fine. The level of reaction time a person would need to dodge some enemies moves borders on precognition, and this is coming from a Darks Souls 1 and 2 vet (nearly 800 hours combined with both games across PC and Xbox 360).\n\n\nNot only that, but many enemies have RIDICULOUSLY GOOD tracking on their moves. Which is GREAT for THEM, but sucks ♥♥♥♥ for the player. Take all of the complaints of Dark Souls 2 humanoid enemies having auto-tracking overheads and you can apply that to almost every enemy in the game with nearly every attack. Granted you can still dodge them, just like in Dark 2, but it's still difficult, and if you're anything but fast rolling, the chances of you rolling far enough to be out of range of their next auto-tracking attack is slim. Take one of the later bosses for example- The Infiltrator. VERY MINOR SPOILERS  I dodge the first attack of her hit string, by rolling UNDER her, only to have her INSTANTLY turn around and hit me with her second swing because I could not roll far enough away from her. Very, very poor design. I wont get into the fight itself until later.\n\n\nThe enemies in this game so far (as I said, about 8 hours in) are almost all humanoid. So circle-strafing almost completely nullifies the lesser enemies as a threat, which is fine. However, some of the enemies later on end up having such good tracking that it's nearly impossible to get around their shield. This wouldn't be a problem if after guard-breaking them with a kick my attack animation was fast enough to hit them before they recovered but sadly with just about anything other than claws or daggers, it was not fast enough, and I was left fighting a frustrating battle of "wait until they attack and try to move in before they recover" which also proved incredibly difficult. Okay, so how about blocking with my shield and allowing them to suffer recoil from their blow and sticking them then? Nope. They recovered before my hit landed and blocked it. OKAY. HOW ABOUT I JUST SIT HERE AND HOLD MY SHIELD UP UNTIL AN OPENING PRESENTS ITSELF. ahahahaha- no. He guard breaks me with a shield slam that is almost faster than my brain can even register and then follows up immediately with a slash that takes down 3/4's of my health bar. Mind you- this is all ONE ENEMY- but it's the perfect example to what I feel is just bad enemy design in general. You want to make your enemies hard, cool give it some of the counters above, but not ALL of them. I literally had to just run away from the damn things until my mana filled up enough to allow me to burst him with my gauntlet- which took 4 hits (and if you've played the game, just after you get the gauntlet, getting in 4 gauntlet blasts can take a long freakin' time with the slow mana recharge and how much it costs early game). Not only that- there were 3 of these enemies in the area, sort of following the same corridor. Hurrayyyy. I beat them but I was not at all happy with what I had to resort to in order to do so- for the gauntlet to be the ONLY reliable way to deal with them at that point just was not fun- at all.\n\n\nAs for the monster designs, they're fairly simple. They don't do much poise damage, they mostly stagger off your shield, and some do fire or poison damage but it's all pretty standard stuff. Nothing to complain about, nothing to praise.\n\n\nBoss designs- SPOILERS AHEAD So many of you probably know that the first two bosses are tower-shield users. Basically you wait for them to attack and either dodge or block and retaliate. Standard stuff, nothing to talk about with the first one... The SECOND tower shield boss- summons adds. Which, if you're a Souls fan, you are probably of the same opinion as I am, that adding adds to your boss fight is basically admitting that 'yeah, we didn't know how to make the fight hard or interesting, so worry about these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s screwing with you while you're fighting this brainless boss". Now I make an exception for this one, because the boss does not stay active while the adds are out, so you fight the adds and then go back to the boss- fine, whatever. Pointless? Sure. Harmful? Not really, it's fine. Now beyond that is where it starts getting irritating. The next boss I fought killed me a few times by doing an AOE attack that covers the whole entire arena. He has a startup and once you know what comes after the start up, you know what's on it's way- but the first time, you're screwed. Cheap death, cheap gimmick and utterly pointless once you figure out WHERE you're supposed to stand, which is not exactly made apparent when your first instinct is just to avoid the blue bulbs and hide somewhere they're not near. On top of that- he summons adds. Same with the next boss, Infiltrator. Adds, heals itself, mana is being sapped.. otherwise a boring fight with only a few actual attacks.\n\n\nThe level design is-  okay. The game does take the open world aspect of Dark Souls 1 with areas looping back and creating shortcuts from other areas- but the problem is going THROUGH the areas is pretty linear. It's much more akin to something like Dark Siders 1 level design where you go the way they want you to go and then loop back around when you acquire a thing that you needed to get into an area you couldn't before- which is really just to create the ILLUSION of an open world game. On top of that, in my first few hours of the game, I saw just blatant copies of previous areas with just a few minor furnishing adjustments and enemy placements. Pretty lazy. However, the ART style is really nice, if you're into that Diablo-esque "hardcore metal hellspawn" style- which I am, aha.\n\n\nIf all that wasn't enough to spook you, the game has performance issues. My PC runs  Shadows of Mordor on max settings without a stutter, this game drops inexplicably below 30 FPS constantly, and sometimes lower- and that's with settings set down on what are described as, or would be considered "medium." Very disappointing.\n\nStory is the most barebones "i'm a tough guy" story you could have. Don't come to LotF looking for anything more.\n\nSorry. Can't recommend this game so far...","October 29, 2014","false","17.7"," 806 of 1,353 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","806","1","0","131"

Outside of Rougelikes, with its perma-death, the loss of ones in-game mortality has held little to no consequence in the modern day game ceasing to exist as nothing more than a source of annoyance and hindrance to its players rather than the learning aid it was originally intended to be. From Software was successfully able to remedy that indifference by imposing a series of penalties to the very lifeblood that makes up the modern day RPG - the experience or ability point that enables character progression. It was a bold and exciting move and something I am surprised to see so few games in the genre adopt. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and now we have Deck 13, creators of Lords of the Fallen, on hand to shamelessly plunder the Souls treasure chest in a bid to steal away some of its lucrative bounty but does a developer from the west, a small team located in the very heart of Europe (Germany), have the verve to take on the Japanese at their own game?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385197764\nUnfortunately no! However, with that being said - Deck 13 does display a certain level of mastery with Lords of the Fallen that while it never quite matches the heights set by its muse, does manage to replicate a fair bit of the essence of what makes a Soul game, a Soul game even when their own game lacks its own distinct personality. While playing Lords of the Fallen one is never quite able to shake the feeling that you are playing nothing more than a lite version of the original series but that shouldn't deter you from purchasing and playing Lords of the Fallen if your hold a strong affinity for this type of game. While the canvas may be smaller in ambition and scope (probably due to budgetary constraints) with fewer options available to its players (you can only select one of three magical paths - warrior, cleric, rouge), and you are stuck with your hurly-burly Gears-of-War type character (Harkyn) whether you like your Muscle Mary's or not (I am afraid there isn't even an option to change the characters sex) it still ends up being a blast to play. I chose the rouge magical set (something I felt more comfortable and at home with considering rouges are my RPG stable) and found it to be quite a bit over-powered once maximized which made the game a lot more easier than I had anticipated. It's also important to note that the selection of any one of the magical classes does not in anyway automatically place you on a predetermined path - you are still freely able to equip whatever armor and weaponry you want as your selection only affects your magical ability.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=366005027\nMuch like what you would encounter in a Souls game, when it comes to combat you will need to measure and time your attacks carefully. Many enemies have the ability to break your combat motion so learning when to attack and when to block or defend is paramount to your surival and you will need to quickly learn enemy attack patterns so that you can use it against your foes. Combat felt a little more sluggish and slower than what I was initially used to but it didn't take long before I settled into a rhythm (light armor for more flexibility) of my own. Should you perish at any given point in time, Harkyn will drop all accumulated experience points as he is returned to the last checkpoint activated. You are then given a set time to reclaim what has been lost (your spirit) before it decays completely (shown through the use of an onscreen timer). Should you not return to the site of your death during the given interval all experience points dropped are then lost. You can also only cash in these experience points at the various in-game checkpoints where you can either bank them into physical attributes or push them into your spell skill tree. Doing this, however, resets a multiplier which grants you more experience for every kill you clock up without using the checkpoint. For those of you that are more adventurous, this risk vs. reward mechanic can drastically alter how you play the game and opens up many different types of challenges. It's a great feature that is immensely fun to play around with.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=384978909\nLords of the Fallen also features a selection of end-level nasties that will be needing removing. Killing each boss results in Harkyn claiming their souls for himself, gaining massive amounts of experience points to utilize for character or spell advancement in the process. None of the bosses are particularly challenging with most of them relying on big, sweeping attacks that are easily blocked or dodged depending on the weapon and armor set you have equipped. While the bosses in Lords of the Fallen are certainly fun to engage with, very few of them employ an arsenal of attacks that isn't telegraphed from a mile off giving you more than ample time to calculate how you will respond. Graphically, Lords of the Fallen looks stunning with complex volumetric lighting and shading being utilized provided you have the juice to power these options. Playing Lords of the Fallen with all the bells and whistles blaring is a gorgeous experience. While the areas crafted for you to explore look like they come straight out of Fantasy 101 they still manage to look stunning even when that feeling of having seen this all before sets in. Lords of the Fallen comes with the stock standard orchestral soundtrack that accompanies most fantasy based games and while it never quite stands out it does the job. I played Lords of the Fallen with a Xbox 360 controller and the layout seemed natural for this type of game. I can't speak for playing this solely with the keyboard and mouse as I did not explore that avenue preferring my trusty old controller over the mouse and keyboard any day.\n\nAll things said and done, as a first stab at replicating the magic that is the Souls series, Deck 13 have done a commendable job with Lords of the Fallen and I look forward to seeing where they take the franchise from here now that a sequel is in development. Lords of the Fallen ends up emerging as a competent action RPG that should satisfy most who play it. A little more ambition and distinct personality the next time around should see Deck 13 inch that little bit closer to From Software's crown.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 7, 2015","true","39.3"," 91 of 140 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","91","140","8","4"

Those negative experiences are greatly overshadowing the people who are in game enjoying themselves. To people who are experiencing crashing: I was one of those people. An AMD Catalyst update fixed the issue for me. I'm running HD Radeon 7xxx series in crossfire and Windows 8.1.\n\nPlease stop giving a negative review of the entire game because it's crashing for you. Every game release has issues. If the developers were ignoring our experience that would be one thing. But the developers are constantly replying in the discussions and releasing patches in order to solve the issue as best they can. It's too early to determine whether we've wasted our money. If you're still crashing then enjoy something else in life and check back later. You can't review a game you haven't played. Yes, you've spent your hard earned money. But. You. Have. Not. Played. The. Game. There's proof the developers are working and some people's crashes (mine included) have been resolved.\n\nEDIT [03/03/2015]:\n\nInteresting. I happened to check back at this review and saw all of the negative comments, which I can only assume are the same people having issues.\n\nShould the product have been a better quality upon release? YES. But the reviews people left gave a horribly false impression that the developers were not responding AT ALL, which was FALSE.\nThis is where I had a problem and felt the need to write a positive review. My review offered what I thought was important to tell people that was lacking in other reviews (i.e., nothing explaining for the umpteenth time that it's a Dark Souls clone. Seriously, how many reviews do you need explaining that?). People were focused on negative experience of the game crashing; therefore, my review focused on the opposite side of that. My patience with the developers, WHO HAD RESPONDED to the crashes with attempted bugfixes, is not apologetic. I saw complaints. I saw responses attempting to address those complaints. That's progress in the right direction. And realistically, that's the best that can be done because magic doesn't exist. NO EXCUSE for a faulty product, but at the same time, leave a fair review noting that developers are responding.\n\nTL;DR (for the lazy ones): You have a right to do what you want with your money. Leaving a negative review because a game doesn't meet your expectations (e.g. doesn't work) within a certain timeframe is COMPLETELY FAIR. Just make sure you say THAT in your negative review. It is UNFAIR for EVERYONE to a write negative review suggesting development just isn't responding to problems. This is what my original review was targetting: the people writing negative reviews because they were crashing and claiming development was unresponsive. Some of us have been on both sides and would take a responsive development team fixing a faulty product over a decent product but unresponsive development team any day. I hope everyone is now in a position to enjoy the game. I won't be reading any further comments.","November 26, 2014","true","18.3"," 260 of 428 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","260","428","0","15"

Familiar and comfortable - which is good, because LOTF's combat is (dare I say it) deeper than DS!\n-The classes dictate your gameplay - the rogue is VERY different from the warrior, who is also very different from the mage.\n-Ph4t l3wtz r ph4t. A great RPG inventory, which leads me to...\n-Stats page!\n\nI don't want to spoil the game or the story for anyone, but everything here is a lot of fun. I've got 3 of the big bosses down and the game is still mysterious but scattered with "lore" drops that unlock more of the story.\n\nThere have been a couple of side quests, and a Dark Souls-eque decision I had to make regarding an NPC (help him or harm him). I look forward to NG+, which I haven't said about a game in a long time.\n\n8.5/10\n\nBuy it for sure, watch it for a sale if you have to, if you liked Dark Souls you will enjoy LOTF!\n\n====\nUpdate: After 3 hours of gameplay, I've re-rolled my character and beat the first boss twice. Dark Souls fans, praise the sun! This game is awesome!\n\n====\nA polished, working and serviceable Dark Souls clone. And I say that with the utmost respect, because it's fun, challenging and feels like a mix of Darksiders, Diablo and Dark Souls.\n\nIf you enjoyed DS, you will enjoy this.....\n\nIf it runs. As of this review the game is poorly optimized and requires tweaking to make it run properly. AMD users have no love at launch and many have issues, Nvidia users should change their Physx settings to GPU through the Nvidia control panel.\n\nIf it is patched, this game is an outstanding achievement for CI Games, because it's well built and fun to play.","October 28, 2014","true","69.5"," 99 of 154 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","99","154","0","0"

It should have been 15 hours of fun. After "The Annihilator" Boss, he bugged, and I couldn't progress in the game anymore.

I had to watch the lets play to at least know the ending, because I didn't want to invest another 13 hours for this bug to eventually happen again.\n\nSo what's great about this game?\n\n+ It's a Dark Souls clone, but it's a bit easier (if you like it to be a bit more casual)\n+ Great graphics and ambience\n+ way more simplified classes than in Dark Souls (things can get confusing in DS)\n+ not as "Dark" as Dark Souls, so maybe appealing to larger audiences\n+ it just feels more epic\n\nWhat's bad?\n\n- lip sync and dialogues. Wow they suck. Also the characters are moving like 1990 half life characters when they talk\n- Could have done without characters at all. You're not invested into them the least\n- Bugs. Game breaking bugs. And crashes.\n- Rather easy (more casual than DS)\n\nAll in all, I would have loved to play this some more, or at least finish it myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaxxxson/recommended/265300/","jaxxxson","Jaxxxson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaxxxson/","738 products in account","Length of Game: 10 Hours\n\nOptimization: Awful, worst port I've ever played,\n\nDifficulty: Difficult at first, far too easy 3 hours in.\n\nDesign Choices; Bad\n\nDon't buy this game.  Don't support the developers and don't think twice about it.  To detail why I don't think this is a good puchase, I'll start with the enemy variation.  This game does a good job initially at giving a wide variety of enemies to fight.  They all have unique ways to kill them and they stick out pretty well.  A few hours in, you will not only be fighting these same monsters, but you will get a few more that are anti-fun to deal with.  It's not that they're difficult, it's that you either have to wait forever for an opening or they have mechanics to bore you to death.\n\nAllow me to explain, using 2 enemies as examples.  There are very large soldier looking characters with a big shield that will block all your attacks.  You can't kick their shield out of their hand so you're left with two options.  Wait 14 years for them to lowe the shield to attack them or sprint at them and bash them with a tower shield.  Once you do option 2, you realize EVERY enemy is weak to that.  How very exciting, eh?  Second horrible mention is the mages that not only explode when they die, but pretty much have a kill move if you attack them during a certain period where they put white sparkles around them.  They do a TON of damage as well, which isn't necessarly horrible, but it's very cheap when you're beginning the game and when you kill them, they explode and kill you, forciing you to keep doing it until you figure it out it.  And while this wears its novelty off fast, you will encounter these things when you have plenty of health and they don't hurt you, but they still knock you down every time they explode, making it increasingly annoying.\n\nLet's move to bosses.  4 of them will most likely be somewhat difficult for you, probably.  I killed them in one go, and those first four bosses is the hardest this game will ever be.  The rest of them you either have too much equipment, or they just don't have interesting enough mechanics to worry about avoiding.  It becomes a mess, where your character is so Godly unstoppable that you juts completely wreck everything on screen.  It might be fun for some people, but given the way the combat system works in this game...it feels very cheap and hollow.  The reason for this is, you have a stamina bar, so you're not just going to wrack up tons of kills altogether, you STILL have to wait constantly for that to recharge, but without any challenge or thought as you progress in the game.  Rather than having to deal with difficult situations or enemies, you're dealing with boring enemies that you meet in the first 3 hours of the game, and bosses that die in a few hits.  It's very flat and not fun.\n\nGraphics are great, they look nice and have an art style that anyone who plays World of Warcraft would most likely enjoy.  They are not, however, optimized, and you will crash more than a blind person in a food store.  You will find enemies later will explode, which is a boring as ♥♥♥♥ mechanic by itself, but will often cause the game to crash to desktop.  This happens REGULARLY on the most annoying ♥♥♥♥ing stage in the game.  There's a maze like area later in the game in which you have to pull 3 switches and these fire dogs are EVERYWHERE in it, and ONE of them will crash your game.  This is ridiculous beyond belief, there's not way this should have gotten through Quality Assurance.\n\nWhile the game has just released for almost a week now, the developers are trying to show care and fix their game up, but I feel the damage has been done and hurts their credibility.  If they cared to fix the game up, there's no way they should have had so many game breaking bugs, bad balancing and generally boring gameplay.  If you're looking to scratch that Dark Souls itch, I highly recommend playing Dark Souls 2 on NG+. as they add completely new monsters to areas, and add more boss mechanics.  Or whatever your favorite game is, don't let me tell ya how to think.\n\nThanks for reading!","November 3, 2014","false","23.5"," 84 of 135 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","84","135","0","2"

Dark Souls fastly became one of my favourite game series after a bit of trial and error. This game follows a similar format, fight monsters in third person with melee and a few spells (no ranged in this one I'm afraid). The combat flows quite well, although it could be a bit more accurate on registering a hit sometimes. The mobs are quite varied and will need different tactics to defeat. The same can be said of the bigger bosses. You also might need to grind a bit (not too much so far though) to beat some enemies, but this doesn't feel like a chore. You grab armour and weapons and can customise them with different level gems. The story is standard fayre but it seems to keep the game flowing. You only get the one male character model to use but with three different classes, sorry girls and girl wannabes.

Now.. to Lords of the Fallen.\nPros:\n- You start in a beautiful looking world that truly does remind one of "next gen" with partical and lighting effects only adding to this goregous game.\n\n- Combat takes some getting used to, however is not terrible once you seperate Darksouls and lords, as they are two different games.\n\n- You feel very weighty, weapons are slow and powerful feeling, sending a mob flying across the room from a well timed hammer strike is always a good feeling.\n\nCons:\n- After playing through the game, I honestly must say the biggest fault is enemy design, the devs wanted a difficult game, they got one -- For the wrong reasons.\n\n- Confusing levels, and no map! While some might like this, I again found it merely to be a time sink -- Confuse the player on where to go and they'll play longer and like the game more! Thank goodness enemies only respawn if you die.\n\n- Many enemies have one weakness and only one for the accurately leveled player; ranging only taking damage from spells, to having a shield that is practically unbreakable. ("Just shield break!" any seasoned dark souls player would say -- One issue, you cant in Lords of the Fallen, making turtling NPC's one of the biggest time sinks and inflating the time you'll spend in an otherwise short game.)\n\n- Boss design: Easily the biggest con for me, bosses weren't difficult in a dark souls fashion, they were tedious and annoying. Sure, dodge the big hits, deal with the adds they summon, run away from the big one shot mechanic, and the boss has full healed again! Time to widdle away at his HP for the 15th time in a row. The last boss especially being unkillable unless your character is built for damage and damage alone, tanky characters or slow hitters -- Enjoy never killing this boss due to its "difficulty".\n\n- Story. Well, it was lacking, and kinda there. Almost felt like the writers watched Elder scrolls: oblivion being played on mute and wrote their own story to go along with it.","November 5, 2014","false","19.0"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","30","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhashbrick/recommended/265300/","therealhashbrick","ManiacMal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhashbrick/","2580 products in account","This is a mere first look review, as a dad and a gamer my time is very limited (sad face).  However I put a good almost solid 7hrs or so in it so I can at least give you all an idea of what to expect and how it plays.\n\nFirst of all, do I recommend this game?  Sometimes this can be a tough question, however Lords of the Fallen is very well built fundamently enough to give an absolute yes.  If you love the Souls series you will get a more refined experience of risk and reward.  Is is better than Souls?  I feel the two have their own place and one does not outshine the other.  However Lords of the Fallen has a loot based gameplay which does drive you to go onward to see what else you can find and being able to switch gear and adapt to what you want to play as for that specific boss or sceniro is greatly appreciated.  I'll break down things in categories to give a better understanding of things.\n\nThe Story\nRun of the mill and not very interesting in the least.  The characters you meet you will not give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about as they don't even seem to have a personality.  They are nothing more than virtual mannikins.  However the lore (audio logs you can find around the world) and atomsphere is something to behold.\n\nThe Combat\nThis is where I feel the game shines.  The combat is very fun and engaging, there is no animation waitout so if you are mid-swing and need to dodge you can do just that.  You can react to your situations with near instant input reaction.  You can also play to your style and not be punished for it, sometimes on the Souls series there were bosses and encounters that pretty much required a shield build to stay alive (or praise the sun for some god damn luck), this game allows you to play to your strengths with the build you want.  You have stamina which will affect the amount of swings you can do before you have to take a breather, which adds some strategy in the way you will be attacking your enemy.  You have mana which allows you to use your abilities and guantlet to shoot enemies from afar.\n\nThe Bosses (Lords)\nThe absolute best part of this game is the boss fights.  Not only are they scripted to do different things for each phase but the complete strategy you had planned out will change drastically.  This gets more and more apparent as you progress throughout the game.  You will feel as you are fighing epic bosses and feel accomplished after defeating them, much like the Souls series you will die and die alot.  Each boss plays on the area that they are in, what I mean by this is they sort of interact with their surroundings and you need to use it to your advantage.\n\nThe Loot/Equipment\nThere is chests to find and loot off of enemies and Lords.  There is legendary versions of items as well which normally has to do with defeating a Lord with a certain condition or challenge.  The loot seems to be varied and happens enough to where you want to keep going into your inventory screen and seeing if what you got is better.  The equipment comes in 3 classes (light, medium, heavy) and has a weight value which will help you determine if it is right for your build or not.  Obviously if you want to be a rogue you would want light armor to help you roll and dodge with no restrictions.  However you can mix between light and medium to find a perfect middle ground, much like how you would avoid "fat rolling" in Souls.\n\nThe "Level Up"\nSo the unique thing about this game is that there is a risk vs reward, one that capatilizes on what the Souls series did but takes it one step furthur and makes it attractive to hold on to your xp.  The system is designed where you accumulate xp by defeating enemies, that xp is not safe, if you die you lose your soul and you have to go back and get it to get your xp back much like Souls.  However the cool thing here is, the more xp you carry with you the better the loot drops and the better the xp bonus.  For once a system that rewards the risk.  If you care not for the risk, you can bank your xp at a crystal in which you can transfer it to spell points for your abilities or stat points which allows you to ramp up your base stats.  This system is by far what makes this game interesting and questions "Is it worth trying to beat this boss with my 10k xp?"\n\nThe Controls\nI feel these are refined and really excellently laid out.  There are toggle keys to switch your weapon types, spells, and consumables on the fly.  This is the first game in a long time where I felt the keyboard setup was actually more usable than a controller.  That is normally a huge flaw when it comes to action games, this however just works and works well.  After trying a boss with the controller just to see if it was an easier experience, I quickly switched back to the keyboard.  I'm a keyboard and mouse guy, with Souls I had to use the controller since the input lag was horrid, but with this game I am happy to say, awesome keyboard and mouse controls.\n\nThe Graphics\nVery well made textures and models.  It is a very beautiful looking game.  There is interesting set pieces and things out in the distance to catch your eye.  The snow falling, the wind blowing, all great stuff.  However the game does seem to randomly slowdown in certain areas for little to no reason other than unoptimize graphical elements.  The snow falling and looking in certain directions can cause your frames to drop quite a bit.  Hopefully they fix this soon, a smoother experience is always a plus.\n\nOverall\nLords of the Fallen is a satisfying experience overall and I highly recommend it to any Souls fan.  It has its kinks and issues, mostly random slow downs, but I have heard of issues where characters popped in and out of cutscenes or graphical elements missing.  I've glitched a few bosses to the point they were unbeatable but resetting the fight will fix the issue and it seems to happen if you disrupt their phase change somehow.  It is a rare occurance was only able to do it once.  Have fun killing the Lords!","November 6, 2014","true","15.1"," 53 of 83 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","53","83","0","8"

This may be a con for some people but I do not mind it as it is much more realistic.  Also unlike dark souls where you can dual weild greathammers larger than your character this game has much more realistic human abilities.  Some of the very large weapons must be two handed to even use (I like this, some may not).  Also just an fyi, armour is much more important in this as opposed to Dark Souls.  I was finding the game borderline impossible because I was barely armoured and getting 1-2 shotted by most everything.  Once I started wearing some heavier gear though it became much more possible.  As of right now (2 days after launch) the game has major crashing issues and I am upset that this is taking so long to patch as this should be a day one patch.","October 29, 2014","true","30.0"," 59 of 94 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","59","94","0","2"

But the game is awesome so far, controls are a bit different than Dark Souls but there actually is alternative controls which makes it EXACTLTY the same. The game itself is amazing, love the graphics and the combat is brutal and realistic, get caught in a combo and you're dead. Much like souls, exp drop on death and is reclaimable, but there's some other things too that is different and maybe a bit more... Creative?\n\nFor souls fans, I really would recommend. There's no customization (sadly) other than new armor/weapons (looks amazing though).\n\nEdit 2: End-game, some bugs\n\nAlright, so I have reached the end of the game and I'd like to share my complete opinion.\n\nThe game is still really good, I freakin love the various, enemies, bosses, armors and weapons throughout the game. Having said that, there's still some bugs and the game is... Resource heavy. My rig (GTX 780, 16GB RAM, i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz) crashes after a while of playing and I get a message about my graphics card crashing, probably overheating. I'm no expert, but I'd say the game needs some tweaking, because there's obviously something wrong.\n\nSome bugs I've discovered: http://fextralife.com/forums/p686398/bug-report-various-bugs-big-or-small/#p686398\n\nEdit: Stutter and potential decrease in crashes!\n\nGot some more time in now, the game is really good and the bosses, storyline, creatures and equipment are really interesting. The only problem that seems to bother people are lots of crashing and I experience them too. Hopefully this will be fixed ASAP as announced by the developers.\n\nThings that might decrease the crashes and stuttering:\n\n-Turn off Nvidia Turbulence and/or Vsync in the Advanced Display Settings in-game (Announced by dev, might help).\n\n-Optimize the game with Gforce Experience!\n\n- Might help to configure the PhysX settings in the Nvidia control panel: Changing processor from auto to CPU helped for some (in my case it got worse, I use my GTX 780)","October 29, 2014","true","36.5"," 52 of 83 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","52","83","0","0"

The sad thing about is that most of the game, the stamina bar only feel like it is there to slow the action down. I can understand the wish for realism, but getting winded in 3 swings to instantly recover 2 seconds later.., i am not a fan of the mechanic as a whole. The game rpg roots are solid, using xp for ability and spells investments rather than actual level up (each investment count as a level up and require more to increase as you do it). Along with that you have a gamble mechanic where you can lose XP. Being defeated drop a xp ghost that you have to gather back or recover using items, otherwise the xp is lost. The more enemy you kill in a row without stopping increase the reward gained which is enticing, as some players may want to challenge themselves and end up with 40 levels worth of upgrades sooner than expected.  The bosses tend to be challenging and require patience or varied approach as your game play style can greatly vary depending if you're the heavy armor self healing type or the nimble rogue-style stabber.\nThe game visually remind me of dark fantasy settings and is passable. At launch the game had a few stability issues, but they have since been fixed, for me at least. most of the few bugs i have seen weren't game breaking.\n\nThe rest of the game is a rpg experience that focus on action and combat rather than storytelling, which may be something some players are looking for these days. It is not my best rpg of the year but, with the replayability, i am still glad i bought it.\n\nHave a nice day all!\n\n-Lost","November 18, 2014","true","28.0"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","33","49","0","0"

I've never played Dark Souls, although I have heard there are many similarities to those games, so if you've played those I suspect you know what you're in for. Fans of the Dark Souls games have criticised Lords of the Fallen for being too easy. This could be true, I certainly didn't struggle for any amount of time on any boss fights, although there is a level of challenge to learning how to fight effectively and to levelling your character up. Plentiful health potions and several of your spells can make the process feel easier than it may have been without them, and the dodging system is generally fairly generous in what counts as a hit or a dodge.\n\nThe story is fairly standard fare, with no surprises and some terrible dialogue. It hits a few tired cliches along the way too, such as 'man is the real monster' and characters that are clearly going to betray you 'shockingly' betray you at the opportune moments. Having said that, the story worked enough that I wanted to continue playing and see it through to the end. The environments are beautiful, and a real draw. Set in a mountain monastary, I enjoyed unlocking the various areas and whilst there's a lot of back-tracking, it didn't take too long to reach anywhere else, with some areas feeling like hubs that you can branch off from. I've heard complaints of the areas not being distinct enough, I'm not sure I agree personally; there's some real variety, and the alternate 'rhogar' world you visit is quite striking, I feel there's enough variety without feeling like the game goes through a cartoony 'theme' for each zone.\n\nThe game is relatively short (I completed it in about 15 hours), although it offers New Game + and New Game ++ modes for those looking for more, apparently offering a little more story and new treasures to discover. The game does have quite a few bugs, notably the game crashed completely on me three times in my 15 hours. Some enemies would bug out and stop moving, and I died for no apparrent reason a couple of times too. All that aside, I still really enjoyed the game, and if you're looking for something fun and not too shallow but not too deep, I'd recommend giving this a try.","November 22, 2014","true","18.0"," 38 of 58 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","38","58","0","0"

I literally just stood in front of it casting rage and destroyed the boss only drinking a single healing potion. it had mechanics I could see but why play around mechanics when you can just face tank something and win?\n\nRAGE IS OP\nwarrior spell rage allows you to use your weapon with 0 energy cost, holy ♥♥♥♥ is that powerful and super OP\nif you're in heavy armor have a relatively heavy weapon and use RAGE you will kill anything\nshield bros? no problem use rage break their guard and kill with your infinite stun lock you have on them\nbosses? no problem slap on rage and get an easy 1,500 damage at the cost of taking a few hits\nyou literally don't need to worry about enemies as long as you keep up a constant assault on them, since heavy weapons often do mini stuns you can combo and enemy or boss to death by just using combos with infinite energy.\n\nBOSSES\nbosses are for the most part a joke in this game.\nthe only boss that I died to was the one where you travel dimensions and you have the option of fighting him in the open area and he uses 2 swords. forgot his name, but thankfully you had to do a little bit of thinking to kill him and it took me 2 tries to kill him\nevery other boss I downed in the first try\n\nNow this all may seem like a lot of negatives, or positives if dark souls was to hard for you. But, somehow I had a reasonable amount of fun playing this game. graphics are superb if running on max settings. (ignoring the frame rate issues, crashes etc.) it was a decent hack and slash game. I enjoyed breezing through all of the late game content face taking and murdering everything. difficulty wise the game is not there but its a good amount of fun to load up and kill some stuff in. I plan on beating it on NG+ and NG++, to see if there are any interesting armors/weapons. lords of the fallen is the toddler version of dark souls, yet I still managed to have a good bit of fun being a dark souls vet.\nis it worth the 50 dollars? - probably not but I plan on speed running this game seeing how broken I can make it\nis it fun? - despite its issues and shortcoming I had a good deal of fun with the game\nrecommend? - can't beat dark souls - start with this.\ndark souls vet? - pick it up and see how fast you can wreck everything in the game\nit's a good bit of fun, id advise everyone just to try it out.\n","October 31, 2014","true","10.5"," 39 of 60 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","39","60","0","0"

After the 2nd boss the game cranks the difficulty up quite a bit it seems. There's an enemy I would compare to the Black Knight that uses a tower shield, that dare I say it is harder than the Black Knight. I figured out that if I timed it just right that I could stagger him with the RT power attack with the Persistance greatsword. I died countless times, and finally was able to take him down an get some nice XP and a "Codex" sword.\n\nAs I said, it seems to be improving as I go along. One of the strongest similarities to Souls with LotF is how movesets, tactics and timing matter more than just sheer damage and speed. LotF REALLY punishes you for being careless with your armor and weapon loadouts. If you think you can just plow through everything with the same weapon and armor loadout you're sorely mistaken.\n\nAlso, a BRILLIANT mechanic that I've been BEGGING for in the Souls franchise, shield charging bashes that can stun/knock down enemies. It is so much fun to use this mechanic. Also, one of my favorite mechanics from Dark Souls that was taken out in Dark Souls 2 has returned in Lords of the Fallen, KICKING!! I LOVE this mechanic, so much fun to use and does more for combat than you would expect.\n\nTerrific game so far, it's being way underrated. And this is coming from a major Souls fan here. It's gotten better and better as I go along. Despite strong similarities to Souls, it manages to really capture it's own feeling. It has a very unique feeling to it, and it's combat is unlike anything i've ever seen in a good way. Takes some time getting used to cause it's a bit weighty even compared to Souls, but it's very fun, challenging and satisfying.\n\nNot QUITE as hard as Souls, but I struggled a decent bit with only the 2nd boss. Great weapon/armor variety as well. Beautiful weapon/armor design, as well as great enemy and level design. I plan to update my review as I go along, but if anything it seems to be improving as I go along which is great. So far i'd say it's easily an 8/10. Kevin VanOrd from Gamespot and GameInformer were right on the money with their reviews. Not really seeing what the other reviews have an issue with that scored it lower. Take the game on as it's own ARPG experience like you SHOULD, and you'll have no issues seeing how good it really is. Something I think a lot of reviewers have failed miserably at doing. I LOVE Souls, and while I still would say it PROBABLY is overall better, that still does NOT make it the be all and end all of ARPG's, something apparently a lot of people need to come to terms with. Lords of The Fallen is a success in my humble opinion, and I recommend it 100%.","October 29, 2014","true","25.8"," 44 of 69 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","44","69","0","0"

Now, before I dive deep into this review I just want to clarify a few things.\n\nI had originally played this around November of 2014 on Xbox One. I think it ran at about 15 - 30 FPS. So I didn't see it worth it on Console.\nI never made it past the second boss a.k.a "Commander" while playing this on console because there was no difficulty option.\nI have waited until 2016 to pick it up because I bought a GTX 970 paired with my AMD FX-6300 so I can play it on PC.\nI haven't completed the game, because I am taking my time with it and exploring everywhere I can.\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics.\nGood level designs.\nSounds! The sounds are amazing in the game. From the footsteps of your plated boots hitting the ground to opening a demon chest and hearing it "roar" until completely opened.\nOptions menu. I would have liked to see more, but what they have now is fine\nThe "Feel" of the game. I love how heavy you can feel when wearing heavy armor and how light and agile you are when wearing cloth "rouge" armor.\nWeapons. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and having certain runes slotted into them makes the weapons more deadly!\nLooting. Oh man, looting in this game is so much fun! From looting armor, weapons and runes I can't get enough!\nMixed:\nCombat. While the combat is somewhat balanced, it just feels "okay". We do have some special moves you can pull of depending on your orientation to the enemy and/or type of attack, I think is kinda boring. I've spent most my time with the following on every enemy. 2 Heavy attacks + 1 Regular + 1 Heavy.\nAI. The AI in this game gives me a mixed feeling. The AI scales with your characters level so it makes sense to make them hard or challenging. Well, with the different types of enemies you encounter (Excluding bosses) I feel like some of them "cheat" or are more difficult than they should be.\nMusic. (The Pros about sound were specifically on the in-game sound design, not the music) The music is okay, while it's nothing great, it does provide a certain feeling. I just wish they had a little more variety. While playing through the game you'll find yourself listening to the same audio tracks over and over again.\n\nCons:\nBoss fights. I am a few bosses in and had the weapon "My Axe" and the "Symmetry" armor set. While wearing this armor you get a 15% (I think) Damage increased when two-handing a weapon. So, I had two runes added to "My Axe" one High Poison Rune and one Low Fire Rune. I literally hit the "Annihilator" Boss about 6 times and killed it. Certain bosses are hard and certain ones are too easy and predictable.\nCharacters. I really dislike how all the character are introduced. Harkyn, a criminal we know that, but what for? Why was he chosen by Kaslo just to help "save" the world? Kalso, No idea who he is, besides a wizard/mage that was travelling with Harkyn and broke him out of prison. Anntanas, the guards look up to him as if he is a god. No real back story to him. (Keep in mind this is based off of not finding every single audio note and a general play-through of the game)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nOverall is a nice game. It's solid and is worth picking it up. I personally waited until it was on sale from $39.99 to $9.99 USD. I would spend $9.99 again on it in a heart beat.\n\nSo, if you want to play dark souls or have tried and it seems too difficult for you then just pick this up. It's a much more relaxed casual look on a "Hardcore" Action RPG.\n\nRating 8/10.","May 4","true","8.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

I'll update this to positive and write about the good aspects of this game if it ever gets fixed. At the moment it's defective and shouldn't even be for sale without a warning that explains as much.\n\nEdit: to add more details for those wondering;\n\nI have left my PC running at times as I do other things, I've probably played under 10 hours. I'm not saying this is a bad game or not worth looking into, especially if you love the souls games as I do. What I'm saying is buying this game now may severely reduce the potential enjoyment you can get out of it. I've lost progress from crashes, I've had crashes halfway through boss fights 3-4 times in a row, I've had to save my game reducing the XP multiplier out of fear of losing progress because of crashing, I've had to reduce graphical settings in the hope of reducing crashing despite spending thousands on a beast PC which can run this game with max settings. That's why it deserves a negative review.

The second game wasn't the same blast as the first game, and that's why Lords of the Fallen has felt like a very refreshing change for me.\n\nThe game is beautiful and modern in a way the Dark Souls games aren't, if you care for that kind of thing. The combat is in many ways very similar, but still has it's own feel with weapons, animations, movement and so on.\n\nSo far I have beaten three bosses, and I got to say the game feels very cinematic in a way the Souls games aren't. The battles are dramatic and hard, and while I beat almost every boss in Dark Souls II on the first try, it felt good to get my ♥♥♥ kicked for once. The same thing as in Dark Souls apply though, that when you learn how the game works and the pattern of the enemies it becomes a lot easier.\n\nI have had a few crashes, and the game could be better optimized but I haven't had any big issues that most people have. Then again I have a GTX 980 and i7 4790K, so keep that in mind.\n\nI will probably update this review later, but I personally really enjoy this game so far and encourage you to watch some streams on twitch and make up your own mind. I can't understand why there are so many negative reviews, really.\n\nIf you like hard games with a fantasy setting this is for you.","October 31, 2014","true","11.2"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

There are several problems with it though.  First off there are definetely performance issue which I suscpect are present because this game was written mostly as a console game which both consoles use radeon, and I use a nvidia card.  Also in regards to the gameplay I have found it to be much slower combat than dark souls.  In dark souls I often found myself going without a shield, carrying a big damage weapon and rolling to avoid most damage.  I do not really find that strategy to be all that effective in this as the enemies have more health and also seem to hide behide shields.  This isn't nessesarily a bad thing, I view it as kind of the opposite direction of where bloodbourne is headed as they are going for a more offensive playstyle.  The weapons in this game I think really need balancing.  The weapons you expect to deal high damage (clubs, greatswords, ext.) do far less damage than the staff weapon which attack much faster and consume less stamina.  Maybe I am missing a gameplay mechanic here but I really think axes and the like should do more damage than staves.  Something that I think is a huge streagth for the game is the magic.  The spell are so different from the ones in dark souls and it is something new.  I hope this is the first in a number of games that follow this dark souls like formula, a genre of fantasy rpgs with combat that doesnt suck.","October 30, 2014","true","43.2"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

I will edit this to a review soon!)\n\nIf you are a fan of the third-person action game genre with light RPG elements, I would highly consider this. The visual presentation is excellent. A stunning game. The combat and overall gameplay is FUN. The game isn't arcadey easy, but it does present you with a good amount of challenge. I hate to bring up the name here, but it is not Dark Souls hard. But that's the thing, it is not suppose to be Dark Souls hard.\n\nThe premise of the story isn't all that bad, and reviews have clearly exaggerated this aspect of Lords of the Fallen.  I would say it is pretty in line with other third-person action, adventure games.  But one could argue that it is a loss when a game lacks a good story and plot.\n\nVoice acting in LotF is also another element in the game that isn't awful.  It is average, but not to the point where you would want to cover your ears, singing "La, la, la, la, la, laaaa."  It did not make me cringe either.\n\nI love the art style, the presentation, and the combat. There's weight to every attack and the weapons and armor that you cling onto for dear life as you battle hell and its minions. Despite this positive note, often times movement feels sluggish, and swinging a weapon feels too slow.\n\nWith that said, you can really tell that the developers put a huge amount of work into this game. There is no doubt about it. This game took WORK. It's beautiful and stunning. It plays great. Runs great, even with the short-changed framerate lock (with vsync enabled). The lack of proper Steam overlay support and fix does bug me because I want to take those amazing screenshots.\n\nSpeaking from the heart, because we all should, this is not a poor man's third-person knock-off of another game.  And I am not referring to "that" game.  I am speaking in general.  Have you ever played a third-person action Viking or Templar video game lately that was great to excellent, let alone good?  Yeah, I dream of those games for those time periods.  While this doesn't exactly fit those fantasy bills, this game is not a Mickey Mouse job from the repair shop.  It is a well developed game, that could use a few more weeks being polished because of the few technical issues that I may be just knit-picking here.\n\nI was going in with really low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, I have played Dark Souls 1 and a bit of Dark Souls 2 on the PS3.  Well, if you are slighly interested and curious about Lords of the Fallen, you will need to treat this game uniquely as its own, and nothing else.  I have friends that played Dark Souls religiously that play this game and they agree that it is a good to great game.\n\nGive it a chance, or better yet, give it a try.\n\nMy rating: 8.0 out of 10\n\n(highly recommended)","October 29, 2014","true","9.1"," 60 of 103 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","60","103","0","3"

The trash mobs are too easy once you know what to do and most bosses I have killed on my first or second attempt, so its not really in the same league as Dark Souls when it comes to boss fights. I did pick up a legendary weapon early on that scaled with my main stat, so that has made a lot of the game trivial. If you are thinking of buying this game, just buy Dark Souls 2, yeah the graphics are good but its pretty short and you can only go to new game++.

I really enjoyed my play though with this game.  Some frustration with slow attack animations, but nothing game breaking.  I had read sites saying that this game considered easy mode Dark Souls, and I would have to agree.  Although it was still challenging at times, I did find as you got new gear the difficulty went way down.\n\nLike most games, you will get a feel for a certain way of attacking, certain combos, and spells to use.  Once you master your technique this game is not very challenging but still wickedly fun.  This title may not have the depth, challenge, and longevity of the souls games, but for someone looking for a moderately challenging and beautiful ARPG this is a worthy pickup.  I would suggest anyone who is not familiar with action RPG titles play this one before attempting Dark Souls to understand some of the battle mechanics and frustrations that come with ARPG games.  Most definitely recommended.","May 20","true","14.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

Be sure to check the forums to see if they have been fixed!\n\nLords of the Fallen is a western take on Souls franchise. It borrows a lot of things from Souls and tries to explore the possible developments of the genre with a couple of new features.\nThe game immediately feels like Souls game, yet there are enough differences to justify its existence.\nThe biggest thing about LotF is that if you are looking for the complexity and difficulty of Souls - you won't find it here.\nThis game is much simpler and easier.\nBut if you always wanted to play more of that fantastic Souls combat without suffering horrible through each encounter - this game is for you.\nCombat is extremely close to Souls and quite enjoyable to play.\nWell, may be aside from ranged combat and magic spells that are pretty basic in comparison to Souls games.\nThe world is as well much smaller than those offered in Souls. And since game is quite simpler, you can beat it in ~20h or so. Which in my book is pretty much good for a $60 game.\n\nThe game does have some issues with balance: spells are overpowered, there's no way to use spell points once you'd level all your spells up to max, UI could be a bit better, world could've been a bit bigger, targeting autounlocks from time to time which is annoying.\nBut most of those are pretty minor and don't stop you from enjoying a good combat, fantastically looking world and cheesy storyline.\n\nMore detailed look and gameplay in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOY8dwpJSjk","November 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","45","76","0","0"

Go with a 8-8.5 out of 10 thus far.\n\n**Early days but I like to give a first impressions when I hit the 2hr+ mark and will update as I go along:\nGreat game for me so far. It is without doubt heavily inspired by 'that' game series (you know which one) right down to the control system with only the primary buttons differing slightly (and you can actually pause the game).\n\nEverything controls really nice, the combat animation is smooth and varied (you seem to be able to use different weapon types earlier the DS), the risk / reward system of the xp drop is interesting as you have the risk of losing it all but keeping it going while killing nasties means more xp faster via a multiplier and better loot drops (I think I was at 1.40x when I first hit the outside and got a 27 damage butcher knife (most start stuff was 16 I believe and DLC stuff 19-26) which was a pretty damn sweet payoff, I think that's how / why I got it, I could be wrong though).\n\nDifficulty (using the rogue with 2nd / green tier magic option) is nicely balanced thus far for me (with the first boss taking me 4 attempts due to my 'one more hit' greed) but the game does a great job at giving you the base game dynamics info in-game rather than leaving you to have to potentially go online or work it all out cryptically.\n\nSo, so far, so great.\n\n**Technical issues / notes:\n-Playing on everything maxed except textures with is on 2nd highest (high as opposed to very high). I had about 40mins fluffing around with settings because the options menu contains no info on settings so it's pure trial and error for the most part.\n\n-Anisotropic filtering seems to stay on 4x when I change the setup to custom. I also had one crash but haven't had any issue since (did set the game exe to Admin rights just in case so that may have cured it).\n\n-I'm assuming setting Texture setting to Very High requires graphics card ram of 3GB or more since it goes really, really slow in places with it 'on' on my 2GB NVidia gt750 ti.\n\n-Camera can be a bit whiley-fox / hyper sensitive at times but not a major issue, just worth mentioning\n\n-Also it seems a lot of the negative reviews for this game are stemming from technical issues so I will update if I experience anything game breaking / stopping and give my full spec as to help those that are unsure their system will be ok with it or are having trouble:\n\nGeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB, 8GB Ram, AMD FX 4100 Quad-Core 3.6 GHz, Windows 7 (64Bit) @ 1920x1080p","October 28, 2014","true","29.7"," 54 of 93 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","54","93","0","12"

I'm a fairly casual player and haven't played DS like everyone compares it to, but for just grabbing the game and playing, it has been a lot of fun.\n\nWhile it isn't an open world or anything, the maps seem fairly decent in size.

The game fairly long, standing at 15 hours with almost everything explored. As many have said, it connects dark souls-combat (albeit heavier) to a diabloish universe. The monster and item design was cool, and the numerous hidden secrets make for an interesting experience.  Many of the boss fights were lovely, although the damage I inflicted upon them felt neglible and the overall length of the fight was very long, boss kills ranging from 3-10 minutes. However, seeing that the game itself focuses even more on windows of opportunity and the rare occasions of being able to load a combo (which many weapons have, interesting mix-ups of light and heavy attacks) on an enemy. The level design is also solid, feeling threatening, seeing closed portculli and doors right and left, only for you to find that it was a shortcut to the section or activated by a pressure plate. The entire scenario is very much a mix-up of the Painted World of Ariamis and the third act of Diablo 3.\nI will be honest in my opinion that there was room for improvement at times, regarding the story, characters, overall itemization  and ranged combat. Most of the times when I hit a brick wall in terms of multiple monsters or a strong individual one, I resorted to spam projectiles with my gauntlet (which uses mana as a resource and allows you to deal dmg from afar, and through a shield in most cases) killing them as easily as a ranged fighter in Souls games in general.\nThe game left me asking for more, even though the ending itself was quite weird and basically left a chance for a season pass to come, and there still are several things I want to see regarding hidden gems like alternate boss kill challenges and what happens if I choose otherwise at sidequests.\nThe game was very stable on me, and I only experienced minor lag during a session of multiple hours, although the loading screens and transitions were quite long.

As a huge fan of the Soul Series and From Software ingeneral, I feel this game is going to fill 'Dark Souls void' until Bloodbourne comes out.\n\nThe game engine is very smooth, attack animations are very fluid and the sounds to go with are amazing and very immersive. If you're a fan of Dark Souls  PVE   than you will not regret this buy! Will post more as I play through.\n\nPlaying through abit more one of my complaints would have to be the camera control or positioning at times, it can feel kind of buggy at times and lead to a few irritable deaths. You'll also notice how heavy of an influence the weight of your armour makes on the speed of your dodges, again like in dark souls. But I feel you're more penalized for using heavy armor in this game, atleast early game.\n\nPros so far:\nImmersive Enviroment\nDestructable Enviroments\nSoundtrack & Voice Acting\nFluid Gameplay Mechanics\nIntense and long lasting Boss Fights with some awesome mechanics and attack animations\nGauntlets (A Shield/ Magical Projectile item)\nLots of lore filled items and audio logs\nOptimized very well for PC, no crashes and consistant high frame rates\nReplayability with new game+ and different classes\nAttacks feel 'real' a 2handed power attack takes a decent ammount of time to follow through giving the attacks a very real feeling with a tactical approach\n\nCons so far:\nNo Character Customization\nCamera controls/angles\nGame pace is very slow\nNo mini map or quest markers which can lead to getting lost quite often\nNo Co-op\nNo multiplayer / PVP\n3 Classes (Warrior/Cleric/Rogue)\n\nMy PC Specs and Settings:\nIntel Core i3 3220 3.3ghz\n16 GB RAM\nGeForce GTX 750 Ti SC (Overclocked quite abit)\nRunning on High settings with x16 Anistropic Filtering","October 28, 2014","true","18.0"," 73 of 130 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","73","130","0","0"

Sometimes I have fps drop down on highest settings but nothing that makes game unplayable. Im playing on Phenom II x6 1090T 3.2Ghz, GTX650, 8GB RAM so my rig isn't high end. Overall game is very good, Playing heavy armored tank it's kinda easy mode but medium/light armor is another story. Maybe on NG+ you will need more dodge and monsters attacks will crush you. Bosses are fine, nothing "epic" but compared to boring ones from DaS2 they have more interesting mechanics. There are some things that annoys me a lot like "invisible walls", a bit too much of backtracking or minor bugs. Controls and combat are same as DaS games (with same terrible run-jump mechanic) with some addition like shield charge (run+shield button) or fluid combo chain light+heavy attacks. I find LoTF more responsive than DaS2, kinda same good as DaS1. Graphic is beautiful, art style, locations, armor and weapon models, everything is top notch, especially compared to DaS2 terrible graphics. Animations are also great, "feel" of heavy weapon swing is one of a kind. There is no map, no objective mark or other easy-mode features so if you don't like exploring locations on your own and being lost (dmn those catacombs) think twice. There are also features like other dimension trials - some sort of side missions. Story? Really? This game is about combat and nothing else if you want good story go buy a good book for yourself. Overall it's very solid title and if CI Games will patch it and fix performence issues (for other ppl?) and minor bugs it would be even better. In general DaS1>LoTF>DaS2 (in terms of gameplay cause LoTF it's very short compared to DaS games)","October 31, 2014","true","40.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Enemies know how to get around shields and they know how to use shields, you have to learn their weaknesses. Boss design is well done, i'll admit after the first two bosses being guys with tower shields i was worried, but the bosses get better from that point on. One thing i personally liked about the bosses is that they each seem to excel versus certain types of characters while being weak to others. As a rogue i had issues that i saw knights just breeze past and vise versa.\n\nGameplay is heavier than dark souls 1 and it is fulfilling, armor designs are a little more stylized but in a good way. While the general enemies are not exemplary, they never felt out of place and they were spaced out logically, i was never swarmed by one enemy type.\n\nAnyways this review feels incomplete but i said it would be short so all i have to say is this game is very much like dark souls 1 except with new story and visuals, gameplay is fun and i will probably be playing alot of it until bloodborne, if you like DS1 you will most likely enjoy this game, and if you want to get started into games like the souls series this game is a friendlier version for new players.","October 30, 2014","true","15.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Just wait for the fix!\n\nLords of The Fallen is an ARPG with gorgeous graphics, superb sound design, and great music. As a lover of Demon Souls, Dark Souls and Dark Souls II, I can only recommend this game as its gameplay is the same as the Souls series only more fluid movements and animations. You can basically choose between 3 different play styles, though you are free to mix and match as you desire:\n\nHeavy armor with slow powerful weapons\nMedium armor with magic and mid-weight weapons\nLight armor with fast weapons\n\nEach has their own style of gameplay, with weapons that feel and play differently. Just like in the Souls series you have to earn experience (souls) from slaying monsters. You use them to level up your character and learn new spells. There are 4 for “class” chosen at the start, and you can unlock a second and third set on your second and third playthroughs respectively. If you die, you respawn at the last save point, dropping your experience. Just like souls, in order to retrieve it, you have to make it back to the point you died without dying. The longer it takes you, the less experience you recover, and once you’re there, you can choose to leave it on the ground temporarily in exchange for a few buffs that might help you defeat a difficult enemy. This game is as hard as the Souls series and Bosses even drop different bonus loot depending on how you killed them and what weapons you used, or didnt use during the fight.\n\nIt’s safe to say that this is just Dark Souls with a more linear level design, though not by much. The story is very clearly told, though it isn’t very compelling.

It's a solid game for a Dark Souls clone or inspired game if you want to call it that way. It's obvious for anyone who played LotF that this game has a lot of similarities with Souls series. The similar combat style, the similar experience loss on death, health and stamina management is also here. But it doesn't mean the game is a blatant rip-off. The developers took some interesting ideas and mechanics from Souls series and created this game. But unfortunately taking something good doesn't mean the final product is going to be good. The story is here and they are trying to tell it to you but after all I'm stil not sure what happened during the game. Combat system is slow and in most situations forces you to play defensively. And to be honest it's way to easier to play with huge sword and tower shield than trying to roll and dodge. At least for me. The game is also pretty short. 11 hours to complete NG seems just not enough for a game like this. I know there are NG+ and NG++ but I don't see the reason to complete them unless you're aiming for achievements to unlock. I heard right after the release people had some technical issues and crashes with this game. But it seems the game works fine now after they patched it a couple of times. Well at least I didn't have any problem with it.\nAs the final verdict I'd say Lords of the Fallen doesn't worth the full price unfortunately but if you managed to get it during the sale you can have some fun with it. 7 out of 10.","December 26, 2014","true","11.3"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

If you did not enjoy that kind of combat then do not buy the game. There are a few key features that i like about the game and a couple that i anoy me a little.\n\nTo start with the game has a brilliant combat system that has improved on the dark souls style. there are a few little things that just make it a bit more skill based and less luck/bruit force. there is a much better stagger effect that requires the player to time blocks on bigger enemies, this is not as hard as parrying and you have a much bigger window to do so. i feel that it just adds an extra mechanic to the game, your now thinking if its not worth trying to parry a super fast enemy at lwast i can try to stagger them.\n\nAnother aspect that seriously made the game for me and i love it to death is that you now have a gamble when you gain XP. basically, you kill a monster and get xp, at these shine things you can Bank the XP and save it up to level up so that when you die you don't lose it. HOWEVER if you keep the XP on you, you get a higher chance of better item drops. I love this mechanic in the game and it seriouly makes you think.\n\nthere is not much about the game that annoys me besides one thing that i think is worth mentioning. Tutorial. the game is quite heavy in the menues and can be a little confusing to start with. i feel that the game doesnt explain the menues well enough but this is nothing that time cant heal as you will learn as time goes on.\n\nIf you are using a game pad (you should be) navigating the menues can be a ♥♥♥♥♥, i dont know if this is just me but having one of those circle menues that you rotate the analouge stick to get around is very annoying when you want one of the diaginals AAAAAHHH, i waist so much time on it.\n\nOther than the few very minor bad aspects of LOTF the game shines through brilliantly, graphics are amazing and the game runs so smooth for me, besides the loading screens but who cares.\n\nThere is one last thing but if no one else is having this problem it must be my computer. the game has crashed a few times for me and im recieving graphics error reports. im running a pretty good GPU so i need to do some reaserch to see if others are suffering.\n\n8.7/10 Love this game, feels like a new take on Dark Souls combat that does not fail to impress","October 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","36","64","0","0"

But for people like me, it's a decently challenging game where you'll die a few times here and there until you recognize the pattern and master the control, and beat your enemy down with a small portion of your own health remaining. Then you kick open some chests and find some more badass loot, you move on and get your teeth kicked in by the next big bad monster. It's satisfying all the way through.\n\nThe game looks great and sounds great, though the voice acting leaves much to be desired. The running, dodging and weapon wielding animations look fantastic, making you feel just how heavy each swing of your massive hammer is. There are some minor issues with some of the animations, and the game tends to have serious issues with cloth and armor pieces clipping through your shield and other parts of your armor. It's not a big deal gameplay-wise, but for a game that otherwise looks this good, it does put a dent in the overall presentation.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game. And I think it's the perfect gateway game for people who want to get into challenging action RPGs, but are intimidated by Dark Souls' notorious difficulty. Lords of the Fallen isn't a perfect game, but it's quite a bit of fun and well worth the money.","October 29, 2014","true","2.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm enjoying the combat system quite a bit, and the sound and animation do a great job of lending a visceral feeling to the game. Heavy weapons especially have a great sense of impact and power.\nI enjoy the art direction quite a bit (armor and weapon models are particularly impressive). There's a good use of color and contrast, and the game is vibrant without being cartoony or sacrificing a gritty feel. Overall it's gorgeous and runs smoothly on my mid-level system. No crashes yet (running the newest nvidia drivers).\n\nIt's hard to avoid comparisons to Dark Souls. The mechanics are so similar. Personally I prefer the combat system here, as it feels more fluid. That being said, the game is a little less challenging and combat so far hasn't provoked that same rush of anxiety that I get when playing DS. I'm still having a great time with it, and I really enjoy the way they've tweaked some of the other systems like magic, leveling, and reincarnation.\n\nBottom Line: Fun combat, great weapons/armor, well done sound and art direction.

Everything is very well polished, it looks good, the story is decent enough, most of the combat is fair if not easy. There is a decent amount of mix and match with armor to stay at your desired weight level.\n\nUnfortunately it is pretty short. I've got 14.3 hours on it and I have beaten it. My actual play time is only 12h59m because - and this is the worst part by far - crashing. It's ridiculous how often this game crashes. There is some optimization issues present when booting up and every once in a while when loading between worlds/zones there will be some framerate drops.\n\nLastly I just want to point out that this is not Dark Souls; it is much easier. As long as you do not go exploring areas that you are not ready for (Catacombs before closing the Portal) you will not experience any difficulty at all. I've heard and read that playing the rogue (as a rogue) makes the game a decent challenge but I feel that each class should present their own challenges which they do not.\n\nOverall though I think it is a decent start for the studio and hopefully a long line of Dark Souls hopefulls. If you come in expecting a 10/10 Dark Souls clone you are going to be severely disappointed. If you come in with the mind set that this could be an enjoyable experience that takes many elements from a game the devs love then I think you'll be satisfied.","November 7, 2014","true","14.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However, things that were taken from other games or made by the developer are not polished and kinda look like the game demands bigger budget than it actually had. The animation is pretty bad, the plot is scarce to the point of nonexistence. And it is not like in Souls where there is a nice setting and you can actually explore it, here the game is pretty linear despite the player being able to go back and forth throught the locations, and actually seems like it was supposed to be story-driven. But the player ends up hacking and slashing the enemies mostly just for the sake of hacking and slashing. The whole game seems like a start, a pretty good start, but that is just it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomjager/recommended/265300/","phantomjager","Big Shits McGee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomjager/","68 products in account","Game was extremely frustrating at first, only because I'm not used to playing this type of combat style. This game actually got me to play Dark Souls just to see the connection everyone was talking about, and I'll agree it definitely was inspired, but its so different from DS that honestly the only relevant link I can make between them is the combat style. A few key things to note about this game would be:\n\n- Every action you take animation locks you. Light weapons like daggers/fists are very short locks if you don't get snagged in a combo attack, and larger weapons like greatswords and maces have a longer lock (approx. 3-4 seconds per special attack swing). This is also effected by the type of armor you're wearing. Wielding Heirloom (elemental hammer) and wearing all light armor I was able to swing and dodge attacks significantly faster.\n\n- Know your enemies! This game is 90% about knowing your enemies and how to handle them. This isn't the type of game where you get in and steam roll through trash mobs to the boss. You need to wait for your enemies to give you an opening and move in for the attack. The more you play this game & the more you die, the more you'll get better at noting openings in your enemies. Once you get the timing down to make hits in the sweet spots, the enemies drop like flies.\n\n- Leveling. I found it insanely helpful to level grind for a while in order to progress to the area past the 3rd boss easier. The good news is that there's an experience modifier you gain from killing multiple enemies in a zone without going back to the crystal and healing. This modifier makes it insanely easy to level up and I recommend taking full advantage of it. (side note: bank your experience when you get the chance, it won't reset the modifier and you'll be thankful you didn't have it on you when that 1 mob decided to eat your face off in an area way far off from your last crystal touch).\n\nThings I would like to see them improve on with this game:\n\n- Combat system: swing/hit lag. There's been numerous times in a fight where I got hit by a swing that was actually 4 feet away from my face, as if the weapon has an invisible hit box on it that extends past the actual model of the weapon. There's also the enemies that swivel around to cornhole you when they should be stuck in an animation lock.\n\n- Combat system: heaviness. I enjoy how heavy combat feels here, but to an extent. I've fought quite a few enemies wielding a huge great axe with a heavy shield on that come at you swinging a mile a minute AND have time to swivel on a heel turn and block your attack with that big shield that begs you to question why this is kosher when it takes you 3-4 seconds to make that swing and sticks you in a deadly animation lock. If combat is going to be this heavy I would highly recommend making sure all the monsters suffer the same penalty.\n\n- Expansion to multiplayer/co-op. I really, really hope to see this game develop further into a state of being where other players can come in as other characters and assist. I realize at the moment everyone plays as Harkyn, so it's a bit unlikely, but this game has a ton going for it in all the right places and I would love to get the opportunity to play it with friends instead of having them watch me play. This game starts out a little raw in the beginning, so it'd be nice to have the ability to walk through it with a friend that's new to it and encourage them to keep going/show them the ropes.\n\n- Map. This game would have benefitted GREATLY from a map or at least a compass that points you towards lost experience points like the loot compass if you're really against maps for forcing exploration (I'd argue there's no reason you can't just have people unlock the map by exploration as they go though). I had no problem memorizing where to go and how to get there after a few runs of zones, but whenever I died I wasn't particularly paying attention to the exact location I was in and I'd have to run around for a while to figure out where I dropped exp. There was also a time where I died at the entrance and dropped 6k, but when I respawned the experience wasn't there, even though I still had 100% (6,438) on the screen waiting for me to pick it up. I had to just take a dive because I had no clue where it put it.\n\nComments:\n\n- I would have loved to see the story developed a little further. We know very little about Harkyn, but are continuously reminded of his reputation. This may be intentional, leaving the player to their own imagination, but it makes it feel a bit impersonal. Also, the ending was....disappointing. I just wasn't really ever sold on this game story-wise. I played it for the challenge and the audio clips were intriguing to say the least, but that was about it. It could have benefitted from a little more world immersion, cutscenes, and an ending that's better than just a re-cap of what you accomplished and a snippet of story about Adyr.\n\nThe ending feels rushed honestly, or like someone got burnt out and just needed to meet a deadline. It bums me out because of how awesome the game was otherwise -- but perhaps we'll see more great titles that improve upon this? :)\n\nI would love to see some worthy content addition that adds more areas to play in so we're not stuck in just this one castle. While there is one other area you gain access too, most of the game is played just in a single area with multiple zones you're entering into. It's huge, don't get me wrong, but I would love to see more.\n\nTLDR: I highly recommend this game and will be continuing to play with ng+ and ng++.

Longevity might not be the strongest point of the game, but if you are looking for a game that is sorta hard, with interesting combat and a style that I personally love, Lords of the Fallen might really be a game for you.

Reccommend a first playthrough is done with heavier armor until you get used to it however. Light armor results in getting hit being brutally punishing.\n\nHighly reccommend learning how to use the sprinting shield bash well to help with handling the more tanky shield-toating enemies most people have loved to complain about. I found after some practice I was able to make quick work of them when at first they were genuinely difficult to handle.\n\nAlso a huuuuuge note to those who might have crashing issues and feel they can't properly challange themselves due to being unable to use checkpoints to save the game and risk losing their exp multiplier: The multiplier is not based on how long it has been since you have use a checkpoint. It simply gives you more exp based on how much you are carrying on you. The only thing that will reduce this is if you use a checkpoint and actually BANK your exp into your AP or SP pools. So long as you are holding XP that you would drop on your ghost if you died, you will continue to build up your multiplier.\n\nThe story is forgetable but enough to give some context to your actions. I'm more in it for the gameplay personally so this doesn't really affect me too much.\n\nThe in game areas and vistas are incredibly beautiful and graphically this game is very much a looker.\n\nYou will need a fairly beefy rig to get the best out of it, but after the latest update allowing you to disable the nvidia specific effects, it seems to run a lot more reliably and much more steady framerates.\n\nWith Vsync turned off my rig runs this at around 60 - 70 fps, usually around a steady 70 fps in most areas. This falls a fair bit when first loading into new areas via a portal, but quickly evens out after just a few moments.\n\nOverall I highly reccommend this game to any veteran of the Souls series who is in it just for the extremely satisfying gameplay. You will feel some real accomplishment as you go from struggling to kill most foes to finding ways to easily dispatch them, and conquering some genuinely interesting boss fights. You won't find your intriguing and wonderfully subtle story line, but you'll find a generic fantasy plot decent enough to give you an excuse to slay more demons.","October 30, 2014","true","16.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

So, brace yourself.\n\nLords of the Fallen is a short but fun game. Its core gameplay mechanics are highly similiar to the mechanics found in the Souls series. The difficulty and depth, however, aren't on the same level. I would describe it as a dumbed down version of the Souls series, but that would imply that it's a clone of that series. Which it is not.\n\nStory:\nThe story is about an outlaw called Harkyn, who is freed from prison to help fight the invading rhogar. Not everyone is happy about this and you will notice it when you talk to certain npcs. As the story progresses, you will fight the leaders of the rhogar, the rhogar lords.\nThe story is presnted clearly, with cutscenes and as background lore which is found in audio logs that you find as you explore. The audio logs are played in the background and they aren't intrusive.\n\n\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay is, as stated before, very similiar to what you find in the Souls series. There are backstabs, parries and ripostes as well as light and strong attacks. The overall pace of the fights feels somewhat slower than in the Souls series though.\nThe control scheme on a controller is super similiar to the control scheme of the Souls series.\n\nYou will start the game by choosing a magic school out of three different options. One provides stealth themed spells, while another provides defensive magics while the last provides offensive magics.\n\nThen you proceed to pick a character type out of three different options. There is the warrior, that starts with heavy armor and is strength oriented. Then there is the rogue, that starts with light armor and is agility oriented. And last but not least there is the cleric, that starts with medium armor and is faith oriented.\n\nNote: Nothing is bound to your starting character type. Any type can use any type of equipement, provided that they meet the neccesary requirements. However, you are not able to get any magics from other spell schools than the one you picked at the start.\n\nYour character has a variety of different attributes which you can improve with experience(exp) gained from killing enemies. This exp will be lost upon death if it hasn't been banked at a checkpoint. When you die, you leave behind a ghost that contains all the exp you had on you, and it can be retrieved by getting to it and activating it.\n\nThis exp on your ghost will start to deplete over time so getting to it as fast as possible is essential if you wish to gain the most of your exp back. The ghost will provide you with a slight health regen when you are near it, possibly aiding you in a place where you previously died in a tough battle. This bonus is lost when you pick up the ghost.\n\nYour character is able to wield a shield and a weapon, dual wield small weapons such as daggers and shortswords and two-hand bigger weapons like greatswords and greataxes.\n\nYou will also gain a gauntlet which is your primary source for magical or elemental damage. The gauntlet has three modes:\nProjectile, which shoots a long distance projectile.\nBlast, which is a short range blast that knocks most enemies to the ground while dealing minor damage.\nExplosive, which basically throws a magical grenade.\n\n\n\nGraphics, Visuals, Art:\nThe graphics are nothing especially amazing, but they are good enough. The art style wasn't to my liking, but I didn't really dislike it either. Come to think of it, I found the monster desing and the overall art style to be somewhat reminiscent of Diablo 3. Anywho, in my eyes, the game looks good enough.\n\n\n\nMusic & Sounds\nI haven't really got anything to say about the BGM. I think the BGM is nice and quiet by default, since I can't remember hearing it too much. Heh. As normally I have to tone down the music volume so that the BGM doesn't get intrusive. No such problems here. The voice acting is decent. Could be better, yes. But it gets the job done, with a static decent quality.\n\n\n\nAfterword:\nIt took me around 15 hours to finish my first playtrough, but that's not that bad since the game has the New Game Plus (NG+) option. I haven't tried the NG+ yet, since I decided to make a different type of character to find out my favorite playing style, but I'm hoping that the difficulty will spike up in the NG+.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game, but not at full price. Especially fans of the Souls series should wait for a price drop, imo. And those who never touched a Souls game or found them too hard or difficult to grasp, this game might serve as a good introduction to the gameplay mecahincs, as it's less in depth and thus easier to grasp.","October 30, 2014","true","36.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/galleonofseamen/recommended/265300/","galleonofseamen","Basically Satan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/galleonofseamen/","197 products in account","I don't know how far I'm into Lords of the Fallen yet, but I feel like I should write a review because it's still fairly new and there's probably a lot of people thinking about getting it. I'm a big fan of the 'Souls' series by From Software, as many of the reviewers on here are. However, as Lords of the Fallen's story hasn't really caught my interest, I'm just going to review the combat mostly.\n\nCombat\nThe combat, at first, feels slow and clunky.\n\n-Armor makes or breaks how combat, for you, will flow. I fell into heavy armor very quickly, finding that the increased defence and poise made it so I could tank many hits while swinging around a big weapon. Once I got the basic understanding of how they wanted someone in heavy armor to approach fights, it stopped feeling slow and clunky and started to just feel meaty. In comparison to any of the Souls games, heavier armor makes a significant amount of difference in whether or not you can take a hit and how much damage you'll take. I like this, personally, as it means that armor is as big a decision for you as your weapon choices.\n\n-Weapons are fairly varied, but rather than directly upgrading any weapon with a moveset you like, you have to find better weapons that do the same thing. It's more of a traditional RPG setup, where finding better gear is important. The weapons, however have fairly limited movesets based on type and some weapons are very ineffective against certain bosses. Overall, I'm fairly unhappy with the weapon options, with the faster weapons feeling weak and having very little advantage against the heavy hard hitting great weapons. There is one advantage Lords of the Fallen has, most weapons have a very satisfying weight to them that is missing in other games. Few things are as satisfying as crushing something's head with a big hammer after you've died to it a few times, and the weapons allow this.\n\n-Stamina and Power Attacks are very interesting. Stamina recharges quickly, and only when you really invest in attacking or block a lot of attacks that you perhaps should not be do you feel like you are running out of stamina. Speaking of investing in attacks, your Strong Attacks can be charged up in Lords of the Fallen, making them more powerful. I like this a lot, as it adds a big dynamic to how much time you're going to invest in a swing which makes a world of difference in the combat in Lords of the Fallen. Another great system is Perfect Hits, which are performed when you hit the attack button just as your last hit finishes, conserving more stamina on the next swing allowing for longer (or improved, in the case of dual wielding) combos. The changes to how you can use your stamina are really interesting, and add a new layer of depth to a system that I feel like I knew well.\n\n-Magic is fairly uninteresting. The spells are mostly buffs or light AoE attacks, and although these buffs have very powerful  effects and can be used in combat I found myself forgetting about them more often than not. The cast time for spells is long, meaning you have to find openings to cast effectively. Even when I did cast, I found myself more often than not focusing on using a single spell before a fight or when a boss was doing an action that allowed me a few moments respite. Magic adds to the meaty combat, making you feel more powerful when you use it, but it lacks in variety. The Gauntlet is very cool, however it is difficult for me to find it's place in the meaty melee combat of Lords of the Fallen.\n\nOne other thing I would like to note before I wrap this up is that the game itself is very pretty. I'm not a big fan of the design choices for how the enemies and the main character look in armor (shoulderpads bigger than your head and spikes!), but the rest of the game looks beautiful. My computer can normally run games on max settings, but I find Lords of the Fallen on even mid-low settings is fairly clunky in terms of FPS and whatnot.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Lords of the Fallen. It's fun, meaty, and so far a great time sink. As a Souls player it took a bit of getting used too, but the ability to take hits from enemies and not worry means a lot after playing the Souls series, where I used to try to dodge everything. I feel like it doesn't have the same challenge as say Demon's Souls or Dark Souls, but it is overall fair and it doesn't need to be that difficult. Both seperate and compared to it's spiritual predecessors, it stands as a overall decent game.","October 29, 2014","true","6.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minorou/recommended/265300/","Minorou","̧҉ ҉Minorou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minorou/","372 products in account","Lords of the Fallen is among the first entries of what I hope to be the beginning of the "souls-like" dark fantasy action RPG.  Like many early games in a new subgenre, it excels in some areas and falls flat on its face in others.  It ends up being a decent game that falls just short of expectations.\n\nThe graphics of Lords of the Fallen is gorgeous, with fantastic and consistent art style throughout the game.  Unfortunately, the game is not well optimized, and does not run well for many players.  Some are unable to play the game at all due to constant crashing.  The developer has been hard at work releasing stability patches, so this may not be a problem in the future.  Just keep in mind that you may not get a smooth experience if you don't have powerful setup.\n\nThe game offers some interesting lore, given to you mostly by audio logs found throughout the world, and a little more through dialogue.  Conversations have an awkward, jilted flow, leaving most characters dull and one-dimensional.\n\nThe meat and potatoes of games of this type is the gameplay, specifically combat.  Fighting in this game is broken in both senses of the word.  The biggest problem is the fact that you lose stamina at the beginning of your attack animation, instead of the end.  Weapons in this game have great, weighty attack animations that lose all momentum the moment you get hit, regardless of how close you were to completing the attack.  This makes fighting with slow, powerful weapons infuriating.  All too many times I've attacked with a long windup for an attack, only to get hit with a piddly 2 damage from a quick enemy swipe, losing the attack and the stamina invested.    Never spam the attack button, as you will most often get hit every time, losing all stamina leaving you unable to block or dodge, all the while dealing 0 damage to the enemy.  While there is a poise stat, I have never seen Harkyn tank a hit and strike through, even in the heaviest of armors against the lightest of enemy attacks.\n\nThe game gives you a variety of spells, most of which have very little use.  While a few spells offer utility, the casting animation of spells leaves you vulnerable for too long, making it difficult to justify casting spells in combat apart from a select few.  You are given a magic "attack" through the gauntlet item, but it is awkward to switch to mid-combat and  does little damage per point of magic usage unless you have invested heavily into it.  Because of this, combat is nearly always through melee combat.  Of note are ghosts and anything with a shield, which are difficult to manage without magic.\n\nOn the other hand, combat can be broken in your favor by the inexplicably strong effect stat scaling has.  You have no reason to put anything other than a Luck rune in your weapon, since the increase of damage outclasses anything else.  Because of this, any weapon without a rune slot or without any scaling (as in, most weapons) will be overlooked.\n\nOne thing the Lords excels in is boss combat.  Bosses are all unique and have segmented health bars.  With each segment you reach, the boss changes tactics or adds new attacks.  This leaves boss encounters fresh and interesting throughout the fight.  In addition, you pick up a weapon from each boss you kill.  By fulfilling certain criteria, such as taking no damage or ending the fight quickly, you will get an upgraded version of the boss weapon.  This is a welcome addition to add extra challenge if you are up to the task.\n\nAll in all, Lords of the Fallen is a bittersweet game.  It ends up being a mixed experience that may be worth it if you can work past its many flaws.  Expect around 15 to 20 hours of gameplay.  Consider giving it a look if it is on heavy discount, but you won't miss much by passing it by.","January 4, 2015","false","19.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/265300/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","341 products in account","TL;DR: Dont expect Dark Souls, but if you like Dark Souls you might like this game, too. It has a more traditional approarch to storytelling and a different, slower combat system. These things arent better or worse, but some people might be upset about that. In the first part of this review I will list the differences to Dark Souls, after that I will tell you what I think the game does good and bad.\n\nDifferences to Dark Souls:\n- combat is slower and less responsive, which isnt a bad thing. In Dark Souls when you press attack, your character immediately attacks, even with heavy weapons. The heavier your weapon the attack costs more energy and also your character needs longer to recover after an attack before you can dodge or attack again. In Lords every attack, even with light weapons, has a wind-up kinda. So when you press attack, your character starts swinging his sword so the attack hits the enemy very late in the animation and after the animation your character has a long recovery time before you can block again, but you can attack very quickly after the first attack. Because of this making combos is much more effective in Lords than in Dark Souls. Another difference is that you can dodge ANY time while you are attacking, which means you can also cancel your attack animation.\n\n- dodging is different. In Dark Souls when you dodge your character "jumps" away very fast (depending on your gear). While you are dodging you are invulnerable for very short time even if the enemy attack hits you. In my experience with Lords there were 2 situations were dodging behaves different. When you are in a defensive position and the enemy attacks and you dodge, chances are he will hit you 90% of the time unless his attack is really slow, especially because your character rolls much slower than in Dark Souls, even with light armor.\nBut when you roll after an attack or while you are in an attack animation, your character will start rolling immediately and chances are you character will dodge the enemy counter-attack easily.\nThe best way to play (this is just my experience) you should block when you are defending, and dodge when you are attacking.\n\n- loot is different. In Dark Souls every weapon is useful, because they are balanced against each other. There are boss weapons and rare weapons, but those are harder to upgrade and can only be upgraded 5 times, whereas the normal weapons can be upgraded 15 times or 10 times. So you could complete the game even with the starting weapons.\nIn Lords however you find weapons which are simply better than your previous weapons. Its like Diablo or Borderlands.\nThis isnt necessarily a bad thing, however it decreases the amount of variety of the game, because every play will use the best gear he finds and fits to his character stats, but in Dark Souls every player uses a different weapon, a weapon he likes because of its moveset or look.\nThe bad thing about this is that despite this there is much less weapons and armor in the game, so there is EVEN LESS variety. This isnt a huge problem though, but its important.\n\n- the checkpoint system is different. When you save at a checkpoint, enemys wont respawn and not all of your potions will be replenished. Every checkpoint can only give you a maximum of 4 potions back and you have to wait for the checkpoint to recharge. Enemys only respawn when you die or when you go to a different region (basicly every loading screen). This is worse game design than Dark Souls imo, but that doesnt mean its bad. An advantage of this is that the game is less frustrating (if you are someone who gets frustrated) and also they compensate for this by not replenshing all your potions at checkpoints as I explained.\n\nThe Good:\n-  good level design . Dark Souls-esque level design with focus on exploration, shortcuts to previous regions and sometimes alternative ways. However the leves arent that big and mostly you are walking along corridors.\n\n-  good art-style . Unique art style which is really nice to look at and even if they dont have THAT much variety in the design of weapons and armor, its never boring to look at this game.\n\n-  great graphics . Looks great and has okay system requirements. Last patch fixed most crashes and game runs even better.\n\n-  good bosses . Mostly humanoid bosses, but interesting nonetheless with different attack patterns and unqiue ways to kill each boss for unique loot.\n\n-  good combat system.  I explained this at the first section of this review.\n\n-  good next game + mode  when you start next game plus you can select an additional spell tree, so you still make progress on your second playthrough (unlike Dark Souls where you have almost everything after your first playthrough), however there arent new enemys like in Dark Souls, old enemys just become stronger.\n\nThe Bad:\n-  small amount of variety. The art-design of the game is great, but it doesnt change that much. most weapons look similar, most armors look similar and most locations look similar.\n\n-  a little bit back tracking might annoy you.  Sometimes you have to go through locations you already visited. I personaly had no problems with this, because it doesnt happen too much and sometimes they change things up a bit. But some people might be annoyed by this.\n\n-  too easy.  The game was challenging, which is good, but it wasnt hard. The more you continue through the game, the better you get and the game gets easier and easier. I killed the last 3 bosses on my first try. Normally the fact that the player gets better is a good thing, but the game has to offer NEW challenges and harder challenges so the player is always challenged. Maybe this isnt a big problem, especially if you consider that I am a Dark Souls veteran, so for non-Dark Souls players this might be hard game.\n\n-  forgettable and unnecessary story.  Because of the more traditional approach I expected a good story, but the story is so forgettable, the game would benefit if they just cut out the story entirely and only keep audilogs and side quests and dialouges. At least then you would have less interruptions and could decide yourself how much you want to learn about the world.\n\nConclusion:\nLords of the Fallen is a GREAT game with minor flaws. This is especially impressive if you consider that this game is made by a small german developer studio and still has great production value. I wouldnt pay 50€ for this game, but I dont pay 50€ for any game anyway. For me its worth 30€,\nI do not recommend this game to people who have to button mash and need simple controls to enjoy a game. Button mashing will be punished in this game, which is great. Also you have to be patient.","November 4, 2014","true","17.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

It's also nowhere near as good as the Souls games. Does that mean it's bad? No.\nLords of the Fallen takes the Dark Souls formula and twists it a bit. You got interconnected areas to explore, you got respawn points to find, you got deaths to do, it's all there, but it's got its own additions to the system. It does magic really well - even the gimmicky-looking but fun spells like Mimic have use - and it has a really cool attitude to subquests: yeah, they're there, but forget tracking and a journal - you remember to do them, or you don't. This may sound annoying and backwards but given the rather small size and huge interconnection fo the game's world, it opens a lot of rewards for exploration: you get this mysterious item, wonder if that guy who alluded to it has something to say about it, better go talk to him - on the way, oh look, secret switches I missed and a whole new area filled with giant ♥♥♥♥ing spiders.\nCompletionists won't like it - or the fact that there's a bunch of choices with very definite consequences that can lock you out of rewards - but it encourages thorough approach and constantly being on lookout for secrets, and the game is chock-full of those.\n\nOkay, the elephant in the room and what most people hate: combat. It's slow. In addition to good old souls' stamina, attacks just come out slowly even with fast weapons. It's not very stylish or action-packed and emphasises strategy over reflexes. I can't really speak for the people who hated it but here's a tip: try out the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing stick you have in your inventory. Wielding slow and powerful weapons has rarely been so satisfying and I maintain this game has the best-feeling warhammers I ever cracked goblin skulls with.\n\nWhat else is there? The setting is obviously nowhere near Souls stuff and you will get tired of the endless snow, the story is really predictable (although the novelty of medieval audiologs helps with that a fair bit) and most of the bosses are variations on Big Guy In Armor. Mechanically they are mostly handed well (two exceptions aside) but could use a bit more creativity in visual department.\n\nWhat it really comes down to is this: it tries to be Souls. It's not. But it's a solid tribute and definitely a good game for at least the one playthrough when you get all the magic of exploring harsh, unforgiving and content-packed environments. The real "failure" of Lords of the Fallen is that it doesn't live up to the source material - but when the source material is brilliant, being just good is nothing to be ashamed of. I wouldn't by it at full price but this game is a very solid sale pick.\n\nOh, and don't buy the DLC. It blows - about an hour long and ending with a boss that's just piling one idiotic design decision over another.\n","March 31","true","21.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Specifically it is a bit more forgiving with more frequent Save Points and more responsive combat. Moreover, you will not rage over a death because of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic. The controls are as tight and responsive as they could be. The "feel" of the weapons and armours and that feedback is just so incredible. You can almost feel the pain when you smash someone with that great-two-handed-hammer. I think no one has done it better before.\n\nGraphics are great with amazing views and very climatic landscapes, dungeons, monsters, weapons and armour sets.\n\nThe storyline is OK and interesting, the only problem would be occasional silly/stupid NPC lines.\n\nAlso, this game has a lot of secrets and finding/figuring them out is very rewarding. Wandering of the main-story route sometimes takes you away for well more than an hour.\n\nSure, it is not an open world by any chance, but it is definitely NOT a single route single corridor gaming as some major reviews claim it to be.\n\nI personally do not like the Gauntlet as an substitute to magic and I feel the game is lacking a proper mage class. Playing a cleric/warrior I as felt the cleric spells to be a bit weird looking but that's personal preference.\n\nI have not experienced ANY crashes whatsoever, the game is probably fixed by now.\nCheck this game out!

I have to say that i don't regret it. Yes, the game has its flaws, but which game hasn't?\nThe bugs and the major performance issues didn't show up in my playthrough. (could be because of all the patches the developers released). In fact, i never had any FPS drop down below 55 on ultra settings and didn't had any gamebreaking bug or CTD.\n\nThere are only some problems i have with the game.\nFirst, the overall length of the story. It is waaay too short for that kind of game. I didin't rush through the campaign nor did i miss any side quest. I did everything i could and explored every dungeon. For that 16 hrs are too few.\nThe second problem is the Lore. Yes you can read a bit about the Lore in the codex and you find audio notes here and there, but the explanation is way too vague and you are just thrown into a world you have no idea of. You get way too few infos about any character not even your own. A shame actually, because the world seems pretty interesting.\nThrid and final problem i had is the lack of quest informations and the vague explanations of quest locations. I guess it is a bit like Dark Souls in that regard, but it wouldn't have hurt to actually have a list of all open quests. I can live with the lack of map or questmarkers, but a chance to reread what the open quests are about would be helpful.\n\nAs you can see i recommend the game so there has to be something positiv about it right? :) There is. The fact that they shamelessly copied from Dark Souls pays off. The combat is breathtaking and you really have to be strategic to defeat the various types of enemies and bosses. The boss battles are hard, but still fair. The different weapon types all feel completely different. Every weapon has its own story and unique look. Armor as well. The weight and energy system is as good as in Dark Souls. Do you want to be the fast dodging skilled fighter with two blades or more the heavy armored Tank who wields a huge axe and tower shield? It's up to you. You can even be both or a mix in between ;)\nOh well and the graphics look badass.\n\nSo overall, I can say that i quite enjoyed the game and might start a NG+ sooner or later. If you didn't buy the game till yet and you really want a game that is a little easier than Dark Souls then buy it :)","January 24, 2015","true","16.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","4"

Also, I might spoil some enemy types that aren't integral to the story, but if you would rather figure out your own strategy against them, don't read the last few lines\n\nAnyways, so far this game is satisfying, it's truly a souls clone in combat controls and exploration design but the game does not share similar character movement, progression, speed, or difficulty. Let me explain: I feel that the game's designers decided at a very early stage in development that the souls style of studying enemy attack patterns and figuring out where to go through trial and error was what Lords Of The Fallen was going to use. But instead of completely copying the formula, as there was a good chance that it would bring more criticism than it would praise, the game's difficulty is only in learning the enemies patterns. Most enemies do not instantly kill you, and very many don't actually hit you for a third or half of your health bar. Instead they usually deal a lot less damage. Also, the game gives you the freedom of using magic in any character class a lot quicker than the souls games.\n\nThe tough part, the portion of the game that I feel people will either love or hate, is that the game feels considerably slower than the souls games. Your character doesn't quite roll as fast backwards or forwards and the enemies really need to telegraph their heavy attack for you to be hinted at a safe side roll. Still, I was able to use it effectively on multiple enemies and it felt good to get my character to a green weight and feel how much quicker he was after getting used to the heft of dodging. As far as dual wielding and the long range guantlet, they are severely limited in my opinion. They have such a high risk of not stunning the enemy or taking such a long time to complete the animation that I feel that the easiest course of action is still sword and shield. I was surprised that the shotgun style blast spell of the guantlet took so long to shoot and since it recommends close range to be effective, in it's current state I have never sucessfully used it.\n\nI have unlocked 4 spells for the warrior class and while I have benefited from using them in certain situations, since they share from the same mana pool as the guantlet, take a while to cast, and have a considerably longer cooldown, I rarely use them outside 1v1 encounters with tougher enemies. They really haven't helped me with crowd control. I can say that the guantlet's piercing spell has saved me a couple of times, though. As for the crowd control, areas stay clear of enemies that you have killed until either you are away from them a significant amount of time (could possibly also be distance from the area), or when you die. Enemies will then respawn and you can kill them all over again.\n\nThe trade off with healing and hoarding XP is explained pretty early on. You can heal and refill potions at red rocks scattered through the map. They have floating stones around them that represent the amount of potions they can fill and those have a cooldown, so the game promotes your progression forward and finding the next checkpoint rock. Also, you can choose to fill xp into either spell or ability points, with the trade off being the more xp you carry, the more rare the loot drops are. There is also a smith that will let you enchant items with gems if they have sockets. It will also let you bet xp into the smithing process to coax out more valuable gems.\n\nThe story itself did sort of a poor job explaining why you are doing what you're doing at the start. It really just throws you into fighting tutorials as Harkyn, and doesn't explain for a few hours why you're just killing a bunch of monsters. When it is explained by Kaslo, a monk you're following, it really is as simple as kill the monsters or we die. There is a lore tab in the menus that explains more in detail what you are doing, and pieces of that lore are picked up as scrolls during the game. I can't say much of the story right now outside of the obvious, you fight lords, you die, they die, it's fun.\n\nThat's all I can really type for where I'm at in the game but here's a tip for minimizing damage with most of the dudes with shields, the doggies, fatty sniper, and the circle-strafing rogue: The sprinting shield bash has stunned 99% of the humanoid enemies, and it almost always leaves room for a follow up attack. Use it on the dog like creatures, it knocks them like 10ft from where it connects. The fat sniper recovers pretty quick so after the follow up I make some space with the backwards roll and shoot him with the piercing guantlet, with the right timing, that's like a third of his health.","October 29, 2014","true","14.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The art design is intricate but not as original as Dark Souls, neither is the plot, which is brief without having the same complexity as a Souls game.

For a start the game is very poorly optimised, on release PhysX and Vsync options did not even appear on the settings menu and even now that these have been patched in the game still performs very poorly with either turned on and worse will run your GPU and CPU dangerously hot, Over-clockers beware this game can cause damage to your components, though its more likely your GPU will fail and crash the game before serious issues occur. Even if one simply turns off vsync and PhysX the game has a plethora of bugs including but no limited to:\nWeapon special attacks that crash the game\nExploding enemies that crash the game\nInconsistent auto-saving that can cause loss of progress or leaving the player in a position from which they cannot progress.\nAll of these bugs will hopefully be fixed in subsequent patches but in its initial state the game verges on unplayable for a significant number of players.\n\nUnfortunately the bugs are not the game's only issue. The game's main problem stems from the developer's misconception about challenge, namely, that prolonging a fight makes that fight more challenging. Of the various enemies in the game around 50% have health regenerating abilities of one kind or another, these enemies are supposed to be challenging when they regenerate from nothing to near full health but all this really does is force the player to fight the same fight they already won over again, this saps the satisfaction from combat leaving it boring instead of challenging. This problem is exacerbated during boss battles and while I have only encountered one boss with health regen abilities many of the bosses I have faced have had some mechanic which prolongs the fight unnecessarily usually forcing the player to stop attacking the boss to dealing with smaller, low level enemies. Rather than feeling satisfaction at your mastery after defeating a boss you will instead just be glad you don't have to go through the tiresome mechanics another time.\n\nHowever eventually the game does become a bit more fun. Somewhere around the mid-point you will begin to find weapons that can take off a decent chunk of the more tiresome opponents health. You will be thrilled when you kill an enemy before it can heal. You will begin to realise that Lords of the Fallen is more about gear than skill and the most fun is to be had once you've gathered a decent set of tools to work with. There is certainly a satisfaction to be had as you dominate an enemy that previously caused numerous deaths but at the same time much of the sense of challenge has evaporated. Unfortunately many of the game's bugs begin to rear their heads not long after this point and your gameplay becomes a frustrating battle with CTD's.\n\nThe game's art style is very much going to depend on personal preference but whether you like it or not it doesn't feel like it has much individuality. Armour, weapons, enemies and scenery could all have been plucked from Diablo 3 though with considerable improved graphical fidelity.\n\nSimilarly the story will make you long for the quiet cryptic narrative of a Souls game as generic fantasy is drawled with all the emotion of a wooden plank. The character's never give you a reason to feel any kind of connection to them and you carry out the tasks demanded of you simply to progress with no care as to their fates. The game's decision to use a lead character rather than allow the player to create their own seems pointless as the character is never developed. He is generic, gruff, male anti-hero number 5677 lacking even an endearing one-liner that would promote him to generic bad ♥♥♥ status.\n\nAll in all the game feels like squandered potential. There is a good combat system here including a few refinements to the souls formula such as the perfect hit system that From Software should take a look at. But that system is dragged down by bugs, crashes and badly designed enemies. The good news is that these can be fixed. Bug fixing and optimization and rebalancing enemies and bosses could make this game an enjoyable experience. But until then this game is impossible for me to recommend.","November 1, 2014","false","32.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This game is fairly fun to play (which is a HUGE plus and the only thing that kept this game worthwhile to me)  and has solid combat (albeit some weird hitboxed in some places). The levels are rather well designed, with everything being interconntected by cool shortcuts.\n\nNow onto the bad, which there is a LOT of.\nFIrst of all, this game runs like absolute crap. On NVIDIA GTX 760, I was barely about to keep it at 40ish fps on all lowest settings. Second, this game crashes. A LOT. And this is especially frustrating because unlike the Souls games, this game only saves at checkpoints (bonfires). So, it is quite easily possible to lose 20+ minutes of gameplay after a crash. Some enemies (I am looking at you, exploding fire beasts) seem to almost always crash the game without question if you get hit by the explosion.\n\nBesides running badly, this game has some poor design decisions. Certain attacks feel faaar too fast and unpredictable to dodge with any sort of human reflexes, so you are basically forced to eat them on the chin.\n\nThe difficulty feels really inconsistent. Unlike the Souls series, it really suffers from overleveling if you explore everything similar to many other RPGs. So, while the game starts off fun and challenging, if you are like me and explore everything, starting about half way through the game you will get so tanky you can just wear heavy armor and take almost everything on the chin without dodging or blocking.\n\nAddidionally, the inventory system is HORRENDOUS in this game. It uses the same inventory as dark souls, where all items are put into one huge list based on the slot they go in. And while this wasn't horrible for dark souls, it is really bad for this game as it is based on the Western style of RPGs where you are constantly getting new armor/weapons which are straight up better than the ones you had before. As far as I could find, there is absolutely no way to trash, sell, or drop old items. And while you can favorite ones you want to use, you cannot automatically favorite new ones. So whenever you get a new weapon, you have to often scroll through 30+ other ones before you can find it.\n\nThe last downside of this game, is how insanely short it is. While my skill from a LOT of experience with the souls series probably made me beat this game a lot faster than the average person, the shortness still cannot be overlooked. Trying to explore and find EVERYTHING, this game took me 17 hours to beat. If I was just doing the main story, I probably would have done it in 10 or less. And with this game being relatively linear and lack of multiplayer, the replay value certainly feels lacking.\n\nCONCLUSION/ TD:DR\nDespite these huge issues, I have to say that I still enjoyed this. But the only reason for it is my absolutely ADORATION of the Souls style of combat (Dark Souls 1 is easily my favorite game ever made, with me putting 500+ hours into it). So if you are like me and absolutely adore this style of combat, you might find this a fun distraction despite the plethora of issues. For most people though, this game is not worth the $50, at least not until the bugs/crashes get fixed.","November 1, 2014","false","33.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But as a game developer I value gameplay and especialy experience over graphics, this sadly wasn't up for it.\n\nA few plus points about the game: graphics, animations, music, sound effects, awesome looking armor (eye-candy) and I liked the storyline although It lacked a bit depth (not getting dragged into it enough).\n\nThe bad part: the combat was bad. Enemies do not follow the same rules as the player, making everything tacticly impossible, resulting in ditching tactis and starting to run and button bash until the other was dead. Even physics rules don't always apply to enemies; a full charging shielded guy can rotate 180 degrees instantly and knock me back, fire arrows hitting my tower shield sets me on fire, enemies thrusting their polearm into my shield gives me damage (100% physical damage reduction and still got enough stamina), I could go on with these flaws but I won't; simply honor rules of physics or how we look at magic.\n\nIf you played the Dark Souls series and loved their combat, don't think this will be like it. Well you can just ditch all your knowledge and the observating mindset. The thing I missed most was the feeling that I (myself) did it wrong when I died, falling into pits because of auto-targeting (not the lock-target) and dying because of physics flaws and animation/attack timing issues (for good and for bad) didn't really motivated me to hone my skills further (player leveling).\n\nHopefuly the developers will keep this stuff in mind for their next game and if they do I would love to buy it.","February 19","false","20.4"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","26","48","0","0"

Overall the game is very good. The presentation and gameplay are top notch. It all feels hand crafted and it looks as though a lot of love has gone into it all. The difficulty curve is very good. If you're struggling with a particular enemy type early on then change your tactics. This is all you realise as you play through. Some guys have huge shields so using your sword might not be the best approach. Try some long spear pikey thing to piece the shield and all of a sudden your doing damage again. Same with armour. You can totally change the way you fight from moment to moment.\n\nSo...Dark Souls. Yes it's similar but so are most video games in general. compare Battlefield and COD...compare Silent Hill with Resident Evil....compare Ridge Racer to Mario Kart (maybe not that one... :))\n\nAll i can say is that LOTF is it's own game despite the similarities. After an hour or two it's clear this is no copycat. they have taken some of the greatest bits of Dark Souls and used them to craft their own world. You can feel the strong influences from the guy who worked on The Witcher. The enemies, armour/weapons, environment do really have a great look to them.\n\nAnd then there's the lighting...WOW!!\n\nOnly complaint so far: Random crashes happen every hour or so. Also...could do with a torch in places...\n\nIf you love Dark Souls that much then stick to that. This isn't Dark Souls, nor does it try to copy it. This is a game for gamers who can appreciatte good games...simple. :)","November 3, 2014","true","23.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Each weapon has weight and works out exactly like you would expect it to. Graphics are really nice but needs a patch to fix the memory leak. Story is decent, voices are well acted. The best is the combat by far though. It really has the "OOMPH" that the Dark Souls game severly lacked.\n\nI want to add a few things. There are quite a few bugs in this game that are downright game killing. A couple of the weapons have added procs that when they go off will crash the game about 80% of the time. The small "dogs" that are on fire and roll towards you will cause the game to crash at times. Enemies can and will disappear through walls, there's no hit detection on anything except enemies. The game is NOT optimized well to run on PC. While running the game with 4gb of Vram my memory will shoot up upwards of about 80-85%. My cpu will skyrocket as well. Anywhere from 20% all the way to about 70% depending on the area. While this game was supposedly made separately from consoles it's hard to tell as you get hints telling you to use triggers or bumper buttons.\n\nWhile I enjoy the game a lot, there's quite a bit going on in the background that is killing this game outright. At times when fighting enemies you'll even hear an "error" sound but nothing happens. Almost like there's a window behind the game alerting to something going wrong.\n\nAll in all, a good game that needs a couple of patches to iron out the wrinkles.

I for one really do think the game is lovely, but in its current state I can't recommend it. I wouldn't say its unplayable, but it does have some very annoying bugs (very odd fps drops, which seem completely unrelated to what goes on screen, wrong enemy hitboxes, wierd AI glitches, and so on). As I said this truly is a pity as the game is actually quite good in itself. The combat is addictive and it does have a nice, dark tone to it although the voice acting and lip-sync leaves a lot to be desired. So yeah, If it wasn't for so many technical issues I would definitely recommend it, though in its current state there is simply too much microstuttering and various stability issues going on for a game a la dark souls, where stability should be kind of a priority. FYI I didn't see many CTDs (just one in 6 hours), its just the other problems that are very annoying. Ethically I can't recommend a buggy game.. But if they fix it, this could become a hidden gem!","December 4, 2014","false","27.5"," 129 of 251 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","129","251","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyBeardo/recommended/265300/","HeyBeardo","Hey Beardo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyBeardo/","386 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUr927fKpCE\n\nIn the past year I’ve become a big fan of the Dark Souls series. After several unsuccessful attempts starting the first Dark Souls, both on Xbox 360 and PC, I finally dug my heels in and found an entry point into the infamously difficult action RPG. I moved on to Dark Souls 2 after finishing the original and spent many hours exploring the world and leveling my characters. Eventually my interest waned and I moved on to other games. Even though there was new Dark Souls 2 DLC, I’d become burned out and needed a break.\n\nCut to a few months later and I started to see footage of a new Souls-like game called Lords of the Fallen. The game looked beautiful and was an unapologetic Dark Souls clone, an action RPG with tight combat mechanics, high difficulty, and punishing bosses. Lords was positioned as a western version of the Japanese Souls series and looked to move into the specific niche carved out by Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2. As a fan of these games I was immediately intrigued. How does Lords of the Fallen compare? Is it a true successor to Souls series or is it just a pale pretender?\n\nDevelopers Deck13 Interactive and CI Games have delivered a game built from the ground up to appeal to fans of Dark Souls. If you’ve played any of the Souls games you’ll be able to pick up and play immediately; there’s even a control scheme that matches that found in Dark Souls, save for a few minor differences. Rather than going through all the ways Lords of the Fallen is similar to Dark Souls, I’ll highlight some of the most interesting ways they differ.\n\nThe first major difference you’ll notice relates to the character you play. In the Souls series, there are no set characters. You’re responsible for choosing the way your character looks and there are no clear backstories. In fact, the story in the Souls series is largely opaque, with a few hints here and there. In Lords of the Fallen you play as Harkyn, a former prisoner with a troubled past. Although you can still customise your playstyle with creation choices, everyone experiences Harkyn’s story. This streamlines the story but also serves to limit your role-playing possibilities.\n\nWhen starting a new game you choose class and magic type. Class determines starting skills, armour, and weapons. Magic type is a little misleading, as your magical powers are closer to special combat abilities rather than specific types of spells. Every magic type enhances combat, whether by weakening your enemies or strengthening your attacks. There’s no option for a pure magic user, for instance, as the game is specifically tuned for melee combat. What magic there is supplements hand to hand combat rather than replacing it.\n\nThis focus on hand to hand combat means that fights are slower and more deliberate. Even fights with low level enemies can take a minute or two to win. Shield-bearing enemies are everywhere in the world and they take up the most time; unlike Dark Souls, where you’re able to break their guard and attack during the opening, the shielded enemies in Lords of the Fallen recover quickly and don’t offer many attack opportunities. Thankfully you’re given a gauntlet that can fire magic projectiles and this soon became my go-to method for dealing with frustrating shields.\n\nLords of the Fallen streamlines the gameplay formula set in Dark Souls. This makes for a generally easier, friendlier experience. One of the most tedious aspects of Dark Souls relates to running back after dying during a boss fight. Bonfires are normally not right next to the boss. This means you have to struggle your way through groups of enemies in order to have another go. Lords does away with this frustration and typically places checkpoints right next to boss areas. You can also bank experience at checkpoints and then spend it later.\n\nIn general, Lords of the Fallen is a much more linear game, and that’s both a strength and a weakness. I prefer the open world of Dark Souls and the nebulous character motivations. I like having the option to try a different route or move to a whole new area if I’m stuck. The bosses in Lords of the Fallen, the titular Lords, are also pretty unoriginal. Mostly heavily armoured knights with shields, there are no bosses on the massive scale seen in the first Dark Souls. While there are different patterns and stages to their attacks, most boss fights are grindy and tedious.\n\nSome of the game’s mechanics are poorly communicated. I was halfway through the game when I realised some walls could be broken by dashing into them while holding up your shield. The health potion replenishment system could be clearer as well; sometimes I’d have them all refilled when saving at a checkpoint and sometimes not. I later discovered this was regulated by how many enemies you killed between checkpoints; there might’ve been a tip explaining this, but if there was I missed it.\n\nThe story in Lords of the Fallen is much more transparent than those in the Souls series. There are dialogue trees and clear quest objectives. I had a much better idea of what my character was doing and where the story was going. That said, I didn’t necessarily know where I needed to go. I lost track of how many hours I spent backtracking, looking for that one door I hadn’t opened yet or struggling to find an obscure corridor. There aren’t that many different areas and some of them are ridiculous mazes with similar paths that blur together.\n\nOn a more positive note, Lords of the Fallen looks beautiful, with great lighting and animations; it’s definitely got Dark Souls 2 beat. However, my biggest gripe with the visuals is the inconsistent camera. Several times I found myself losing my character into first person mode by getting too close to a wall in combat.\n\nUltimately I enjoyed Lords of the Fallen; however, there isn’t as much replayability for me when compared to Dark Souls. You’re limited in character creation choices and there’s not that much difference between a cleric, a warrior, and a rogue. There are extra boss challenges that’ll reward you with a special weapon if you complete them but some of these are exceptionally difficult and don’t interest me that much.\n\nI beat the game once in about 20 hours and then again in New Game+ in another 10 hours or so; I had a lot of fun playing through the first time but NG+ wasn’t that different. The combat kept me coming back but at a certain point the enemy scaling outpaced my own and I stopped having as much fun. The interminable backtracking also wore me down; there’s only so much time I want to spend running around a circular room.\n\nPlaying Lords of Fallen made me appreciate the Souls series even more; it’s been enough to whet my appetite for another Dark Souls 2 playthrough, and an attempt at the new DLC. I’m looking forward to Lords of the Fallen 2; hopefully Deck13 Interactive and CI Games will deliver a game with wider scope and more interesting bosses. Until then, there’s always the endless appeal of Dark Souls.","January 9, 2015","true","36.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a pretty short campaign. At the beginning your first mission is to find some guy named Kelso. It has good replay value. After playing it twice, I still don't know much of the Lore. Some areas can be really confusing. I spent hours wandering around. The areas loop back and short cuts can be opened. Almost every enemy's attack is easily dodgable. Some of the enemies will do a series of weak attacks, and then randomly do an attack that does enough damage to kill you in one hit. It seems unfair. Overall it's a good game and it's worth playing.

All weapon types handle very differently and you have a lot of choices on how to engage and deal with enemies trough combos, leap attacks, rollattacks, parries, counters etc.\n- The itemsystem and rpg element of the game is very solid.

If you are using an AMD graphics card, this game will likely slow down or run at sub optimum. The specs required are higher than suggested. It isn't super stable.\n\nThat said, this game is a solid experience. Like many people, I will compare it to Dark Souls since they fit in the same niche. This game is an odd blend of Diablo style leveling & loot collection (everything is randomized), and Dark Souls combat.\n\nYou can technically pick a class, but very quickly these have little to no difference, beyond the cleric having a heal. Weapon stats, damage, and speed are all random so a pair of shortswords can do more damage than a two hander, and be slower. You have a stamina bar, health, a limited number of health potions that refill at rest points, a block, parry, heavy attack, light attack, and roll.\n\nThe art personally reminds me of the chunky comic book style from Darksiders, so a big plus. It does repeat the Dark Souls 2 problem of most enemies being some variation of "guy in armor", but they all look impressive, and the rarer non-human enemies are quite cool. The story is pretty standard fantasy fluff, and isn't going to under or overwhelm anyone. For 20$ or less, you are getting 10+ hours of solid game to slake that thirst that -for me- only the Souls series really fills.","March 23","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Really obviou,but the fact is that it does a very good job in creating a world and using the souls gameplay in a very good way. It is to be expected then, that you will be drawing parallels between the two. First of all is it worth the money? I would say even though there is no pvp as far as my knowledge goes (it might change latter) that it is worth the money and time to play this game. It really has been a long time since I spend 30 hours in a few days not even a week in a game such as this, the combat system is fun and challenging (not as much as the souls series) and there are enemies that will require you to really figth hard to beat them (or use magic but we'll get to that) the leveling system is also nice, one small critisism I have is that faith weapons become really weak later on, but over all it's a really well made game polished with fun staged and bosses. At this point I have to say that it is rather easier that what dark souls, demos souls or bloodborne are to the point that an experienced souls player can beat bosses on a first run without a guide (which is wild fantasy in a souls game) and thats because of what I refered to previously as "magic".\n\nMagic in this game or spells are really overpowered, to the point that you 3 shot a boss with a fully upgraded quake, now that doesn't hold true for the NG+ but you have to remember that unless you want a specific item for the aestherics of it and a few achivements, there is absolutely no reason to replay the game in NG+, NG++ on so on. Unless you really love the game. But appart from the no PVP problem other than that this game packs a really nice storyline with some plot twists some nice secrets, interesting gameplay especially stealthy gameplay at some points since there are enemies who can not hear you and has a few choices that matter in terms of story and gameplay (not too many and no where near as much as they do in the souls games but your choices matter non the less).\n\nSo in all honesty if you really like the souls series but you are not a easily buthurt fan boy, in which case you should avoid the game and the review all together, then I can not recomment this game enough, it has really been a long time since a game had such nice aestherics in regards to the enemies the weapons the armours the effects in pretty much everything it incorporates the gameplay is polished and works very nice the bosses have specific patters which if you don't want to abuse with spells then they make for a really nice challenge, also a thing I really like is the fact that you can use any weapon you happen to come by and by that I mean there are no useless weapons, you still need the appropriate skill to use them (dex stg etc) but I haven't found a single weapon that was legitimately useless. So over all it's an awesome under rated game that has been hated a lot mostly for the lack of PVP and really deserves your time if you are into this kind of games like I am.","May 2","true","32.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But once you develop certain magical skills, the difficulty drops almost to the point of tedium (for me, the skill that did it was "Stab" on a rogue, and to a certain extent, "Shift"). Most common opponents suddenly pop like soap bubbles, and as soon as you learn to evade the most damaging boss attacks, the big guys no longer pose nearly as much of a threat as they're probably meant to do. And since the story is dark fantasy boilerplate with ciphers for characters, even the admittedly gorgeous visuals can no longer make up for the fact that your sole incentive for plodding through the game is the prospect of finding shinier toys in the next chest. That ain't much. I'm by no means saying LotF is a bad game, especially if you can get it during a sale, which is why I'm still recommending it. You may well get a few hours worth of fun out of this title. Just not enough fun—or challenge—to last to the very end of it.","May 9","true","24.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Once I was in a comfortable set of armor and found a weapon I liked, the game was a breeze and again little to nothing posed any real threat, I mean I one shot every boss in the game as I went through and the bosses were easily harder than any of the trash that was encountered. Now, I will mention this, this game is HEAVILY inspired by the Souls series, and rightfully so, the Souls game were so unique and so unforgiving that when I had finished them both with about 200 hours invested into each I was craving more of that Souls style combat and I found it here in spades, just not really as punishing as souls.\nAll the people who said that this game was bad because combat was slow a clunky and the developers tried to make it hard by making enemies dodge hit and block faster than you clearly has no patience at all, they were obviously spoiled by games like Darksiders where you can litterally button mash your way to victory. Combat in Lotf is precise and deiliberate. Swinging a heavy weapon means looking for that window, taking advantage of it, and reducing yourself to the fact that you may only get the one swing in unless you use a weapon which a much faster attack speed, it's all up to the player. What I did like was that they allowed magic to be a viable option even when building a melee character without being punished for it. This is a solid game and if you are the type that enjoys weighty realistic combat, visceral environments kick a$$ looking bosses, this game will not let you down. 8/10 for me.","November 7, 2014","true","25.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Game still crashed after about 15 minutes.  I wouldn't bother with this, or at least try to get it on sale on a console where it's hopefully more stable.\n\nI would like to be able to give this game a proper review, but it is bugged and crashes every 20-30 minutes.  Looking around, this seems to be fairly common, with some people not even able to get into the game due to another bug that blocks them at startup, even after the patch.\n\nOn the second boss, he is bugged for me so that occasionally he stands in place, but still continues his actual attacks, so while he stands there like a statue, I take random ghost damage from an invisible source.  The game crashed for me once immediately after defeating him (no credit for the victory), and once when there was one swing left.\n\nSo far I've only been able to wade through the crashing to get to two bosses, both of which just have huge tower shields, and it's nothing but circle strafe and poke until you win.\n\nI will assume for the sake of the game that is has some variety in its further levels, but I won't be able to see those until the game gets into working order on PC.

Here's why:\n\n1. Game crashes anywhere from 5-20 minutes. This is a critical and inexcusable issue, and a product of this cost should not be crashing on most players' PCs. This is something would find in Alpha phase with even a halfway compentent QA or development staff.\n\n2. Product feels half finished. For what contect there is, it feels like half a game. The story is vague and generic. The characters are not even close to flushed out. The world is particularly small. What the player can do is limited. The camera angle and use in third person (the only viewpoint) is terrible at times. Your character's purpose in the world is a little too simple.\n\nI don't like to be completely negative, and there are some good aspects of the game:\n\n1. Even though the game can be difficult, it can be fun at times. The combat, although clumsy, is more or less solid and satisfying. Additionally, although simplistic, character development enhances the "RPG" aspect of the game, but it seems to cater to the warrior class and playstyle and punishes any other choice.\n\n2. Graphics are up to par for current gen - the gritty art style compliments the use of the various graphic effects employed. Sound effects are well done.\n\nOverall, I would only recommend the game if the developers patch the game properly and sell it for about half the price.

He is a warrior with a mysterious past ready to confront an army of demons. He was release from jail by a mysterious man called Kaslo. Kaslo gives Harkyn an opportunity for him to redeem for his crimes in a mission to save the realm dominated by demons.\n\nThe gameplay is really good and easy to learn. I strongly recommend to play it with a controller, otherwise, the game can be harder to play. The game uses a "risk and reward" system. The amount of experience the player can gain for use can be increased through a multiplier that builds up the longer the player mixes up combo attacks or avoids using checkpoints and spending their experiences.\n\nThe cons that I have about this game are about the cutscenes and the camera. They could have putted more effort in the cutscenes to be more natural. Sometimes the dialog and the movements of the characters do not match, and the scenes are very robotic.\nThe camera during the gameplay can be tricky sometimes. As an example, in a small room during a fight, the camera goes into an angle that you cannot see your character or the enemy, and this can become deadly sometimes. This event happens in rare times, but when it happens it is very annoying.\n\nIf you enjoyed the serie of Souls and like new challenges, this game is a good choice for you!\n\n9.5/1O","December 20, 2015","true","24.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","10","18","2","0"

If I'm not fighting hordes of enemies that never lower their shields, I'm fighting the poor, corridor-based level design, the abysmal inventory system, the confusing item switching system, the laughable dialogue or the non-existant story.\n\nIt's quite a clunky game. Often you'll fight enemies with shields. Shield bash them, or kick their shield, and they'll lower their shield. For about a second. There is no time, even with some of the faster weapons, to follow up with an attack. It's as if Lords took the Dark Souls combat system but forgot to tune it based on their enemies.\n\nAs for story, there are quite a few side characters about, that all seem to care greatly what's going on. Even the playable character, Harkyn, seems to care what is going on. But I can't for the life of me give a single solitary damn, becuase I have no idea where, who, what I am, why I'm doing it, who I'm doing it with... You're just not given any of that information, so it's rather hard to empathise with any of the 2-dimensional characters.\n\nThe animations are stiff, in dialogue especially. Dialogue sounds like it was recorded somewhere that wasn't a recording studio, and that the VAs weren't really fully immersed.\n\nAnd after my good 3-4 hour excursion, I've met cumutavely a total of between 5 and 7 different enemy types. There's undead hollow thing, smaller undead thing with sword and shield, bigger undead thing with sword and shield, bigger undead thing 2handing, fat undead thing with a crossbow... It's not the most creative game. Sure, the skyboxes can be pretty if you can make it out behind all that lens flare, but I'm a bit tired of snowy castles and towers.\n\nIt can be quite entertaining. quite. I've found myself thinking it's like dark souls but with the darksiders aesthetic and lack of fun.\n\nIn no way could I recommend this for it's RRP. I grabbed this on sale for roughly £12, and to be perfectly honest, at the moment that's about the maximum I'd tell someone to buy it for.\n","December 28, 2014","false","5.4"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

There are so many small things that this game does worse than the former, and it makes the entire thing feel much worse for it.\n\nFirst, the camera is like being followed by a helicopter with Parkinson's disease. It goes from uncomfortably shaky in large, open areas, to almost laughably ridiculous in smaller, tighter spaces.\n\nSecond, the combat. While a game like Dark Souls is more punishing than trying to fist a bear, it was always...ALWAYS fair. I can count on one hand the amount of times I died in Dark Souls and felt it wasn't completely my fault. In Lords of the Fallen, however, I died a dozen times in just the first area, and while I initially chalked it up to my learning the mechanics of the game, it soon became clear that this game is much, much harsher and even less fair when it comes to combat.\n\nWhile the idea of a bulkier, heavier Dark Souls sounds like an awesome game, this is not that game. It all looks very pretty, but it fails to live up to the standards of the game it so obviously is trying to be. This game is trying to stand on the shoulders of a giant like the Souls series, only to realize that it has no legs.\n\nThis can all be summed up in an experience I had while trying to fight the second boss of the game. After dying maybe ten, fifteen times to the thing, I finally endured the nearly half-hour boss fight, had finally withered it down to the last fractions of it's health...and the game crashed on me.\n\n2/10\n\nWould not buy again\n\n(also, it bears mentioning that game difficulty itself is not an issue for me [please refer to the 200 hours I've spent on Dark Souls], it is when a game is difficult without also being fair that I take issue)","December 27, 2014","false","3.7"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zelter/recommended/265300/","Zelter","Zelter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zelter/","206 products in account","Well, it didn't crash, as others have had issues with. My issues reside in the general feel of the game.\n\nIt's a pretty short game, offering much less of a challenge than your typical Souls game. Very few bosses, very few varying enemy types, and a hell of a lot of snow.\n\nMusic is ok, not bad at all really, but I suffered from a bug in which dying on a boss stopped its music from playing for its first phase, making it more frustrating than enjoyable to re-fight.\n\nCombat, I personally went a strengh build, but any weapon that wasn't a one handed axe or sword attacked FAR too slow to be useful. Even stacking tonnes of poise and the heaviest armour, if you get hit out of a wind-up for your attack (as with large enemies and bosses) your attack is worthless and wasted stamina, resulting in rather crappy fights even with your standard enemy. Enemies also have a habit of, upon being blocked by a shield, reset to standing and ready to attack animation, meaning right after attacking, they recoil, jold back into idle, then attack again, all relatively quickly. Same happens if you shield bash a few enemies and hit them while they're recoiling, upon landing your strike they jolt back up to idle (even if they were on the damn floor ragdoll-ing) and are immediately ready to attack you, which the AI will. It's buggy, and while I see the appeal of a clunky, heavy sort of combat system, the game needs A LOT of polishing to make it better (and that's ignoring all the bugs).\n\nThe checkpoint and experience system is interesting, and actually the best feature of this game IMO. If you don't rest at a checkpoint (restoring up to 3 potions and all your hp, while saving progress) then you keep an experience multiplier you gain per enemy kill, offering eventually up to a total of 2x the experience for killing an enemy. It is a fair system, and I can't see it hindering any Souls-type game.\n\nThe look of the game isn't bad. Armour is nicely designed, but that's about the best looking thing you'll get. Bosses are ok. Areas are pretty lacking in diversity, and all look relatively boring. There is TOO MUCH snow, which'd have been fixed by probably having the game take longer than 10 hours to complete, with a total of 5 different areas to go and crap plot that says "go back here because I said so"\n\nThe challenge rooms and bonus portals aren't challenging at all, but that's just free possible loot.\n\nThe upgrade system is a pain to get decent upgrades, relying on RNG to give you the rune you want with a limited number per playthrough is crap.\n\nThe loot is actually lacking, because it's such a short game. I went through 90% of the game with an axe I found within the first hour, simply because nothing was better than it in terms of wind-up animation, energy usage and damage ratios. I then swapped to an axe I found near the end of the game. One handed axes are probably the best thing IMO, offering a decent wind-up time (compaired to horrid 2 handed and great weapons), relatively low energy usage, for some pretty high damage.\n\nThe gauntlet system is... interesting. Relatively unexplained, the damage stat on each gauntlet type is misleading and the only way to "upgrade" the gauntlet is to put a rune in it. That's not upgrading, that's augmenting, and should be refered to as such to avoid confusion. I had to read a Steam guide to figure out what the hell I was doing with it.\n\nStory-wise, it's terrible. I thought they were trying to hand the story a bit more to you, but it came across as far too fast paced (as stated, game is short) but some bits are just stupid. [[[SPOILERS]]] The hell was up with that whatever-her-name-was sidequest, the one that ended with her just ♥♥♥♥ing off with the biggest demon you see without saying a word about why, and apparently that "reunited her with her family". I've either missed an audio log or 5, or some major sidequest dialogue with her, because she said nothing about that. I also don't see why Antanas decided to mutate himself and the only 2 others of his company (who were stated to just be monks), and how the other opposition was just plain knights. Again I've either missed audio logs, or it was just a plot device thrown in so you go back and have a reason to kill him, given that you eventually make it to the Fallen God and instead of having the choice there to slay the god, you're just told to ♥♥♥♥ off back to the citadel and "make your choice". You don't make the choice, you just go back there, get called a traitor, and are forced to kill Antanas. The only choice is how you use "plot device" rune. It's all lack luster, personally, and needed MUCH more work if it were to be better, but it's just short, like it was rushed out.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend it as it currently is. It's short, cutting into every aspect of the game from story, to levels, to combat, to loot, to music, to diversity of everything. It's hugely unpolished, buggy as hell, doesn't offer much of a challenge, and generally sucks. It's a shame, it could have been a lot more.","December 25, 2014","false","18.5"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","23","44","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicioussama/recommended/265300/","vicioussama","GodEmperor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicioussama/","220 products in account","In Short:\nGame is fun for the most part. The combat takes some getting used to because it is far more sluggish/slow than those who are used to the souls series. It's a pretty neat looking ascetic overall in my opinion, but the high fantasy style that seems similar to World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, or Darksiders series is getting a bit over used. The story is nothing special, but not bad either. There's a lot of lore to find, but it's told to you in scrolls and cutscenes and such, not like the Souls series where you find items and piece the lore together yourself.\n\nThere are some nit picking problems like I don't find the jump mechanic and various areas to get some loot and require a jump any fun, just frustrating, but those small issues don't detract enough from the game's over all joy. The only big problem are the crashes. As of October 30th, the game crashes way too easily and often. For those who don't have an Nvidia to do that "fix" (which doesn't work for everyone) you're pretty much screwed until they patch it. The other issue is the frame drops which are fairly frequent (doesn't seem optimized). I'd wholly recommend it immediately if not for the crashes and frame drops. For now, I'd say get it if you're REALLY looking for a mixture of Diablo 3/Darksiders style world and Souls style combat, but I'd hold off until they finally fix these technical problems with the game.\n\nSteam seriously needs a third option for "Do you recommend this game" imo, basically "Yes, with warnings" or something.\n\nA Bit More Depth:\n\nBosses (far as I can tell so far after playing as long as I have) aren't anything special. They're about on par with Dark Souls 2 in terms of design (which means it falls short, imo, to Demons's and Dark Souls bosses), but they are fun fights. A bit too many humanoid enemies which is disappointing, but the different humanoid types are vastly different in attack styles and require different ways to deal with which is fun. The settings for most bosses also are pretty Dark Souls 2 from my experience, plenty of room to maneuver (nothing so far that feels like Capra demon in DkS1 where you're cramped for room to move). I'd say the only real gripe here is that some bosses have some one shot killing abilities that you won't know how to deal with immediately and that can be frustrating, but I personally don't mind it too much if there are some good cues (without being blatantly told) of how to deal with it and most do have that, some are just more subtle than others.\n\nAnother really cool thing about bosses is that they have the ability to get special loot from them when you beat them in a certain way. The only downside here is that there's NOTHING to indicate what that special way would be leaving you to have to look it up online or just stumble upon the solution by dumb luck (which means you might not know exactly what caused you to get the special loot).\n\nThe level design is pretty straightforward as you go through the game (not much in terms of choice of path), but when you get through the game you open up more and more paths that show how there's some interconnectivity to the overall world design. For those who loved that aspect in Dark Souls, they'll enjoy it here as they get through toward later parts of the game. It's just a bit of a pity there's no real choice in path from the start in which way to go, but it's not bad from a story telling perspective and the levels look nice enough and have a good amount of interconnectivity within themselves for side paths and short cuts and such that it's never a bother (at least to me, you might feel differently).\n\nIt's a bit sad you can't customize a look for your character, but that's to be expected given how they tell the story, but what is nice is how much you can customize your character in terms of armor and weapons to use. And the fact you always carry them all on you at once makes it easy to switch weapons and gear and find what you really enjoy. While it doesn't get as punishing as a Souls game because there is a pause menu that allows you to change gear, even in combat (to a degree, not at all points, but if you haven't been attacked or not attacking for a bit, you can switch comfortably as the game is paused to let you do so), it does allow such experimentation with the different weapons that you'll appreciate it as every weapon is VERY different from one another in every way and some will adhere to a person's playstyle more than others.\n\nFor example: I started as a warrior, I used a sword and shield from the start and found I wasn't enjoying it as I did with Dark our Demons's Souls. The attack felt a bit too sluggish to capitalize on brief moments of an enemy's vulnerability and even though the shield claimed 100% defense, some enemies still seemed to attack through it (at a lesser damage than if I wasn't blocking) at points (far as I can gather that's more due to their attacks being able to pierce shields, so it's by design). So I have currently gone to using a larger two handed weapon that can do ridiculous damage and/or stun/stagger the majority of enemies to get through the game. I'll only occasionally use the shield for some attacks or in clutch moments. It's still very enjoyable though.\n\nTo go on more about weapons, they are also upgradable by various "runes" you can find in the world and from enemies and have to unlock at an NPC and place within a weapon at that NPC (who can be summoned at specific parts of the world). The weapons and armor generally have 'sockets' to place these runes. So in that case, it's very WoW/Diablo 3 in the customization of weapons and less the way Dark Souls did it. The only downside is that Runes are "unlocked' and what you get is random. You can use some Experience points to increase the chance for higher quality runes, but that randomness is still something I don't wholly like, but that's a personal opinion.\n\nSpeaking of Experience points, they are very similar to Souls in the Souls games. They are your everything. You use it to unlock your magical abilities and they are used to unlock runes and they are used to gain points to be placed into specific attributes. In this way, it's a lot like the Souls games which I like. The more you spend into the points the higher the cost it is to get the point to spend for your attributes. The attributes are Strength, Vitality, Endurance, Faith, Luck, and Agility. For the most part, what each does is straight forward. Strength increases damage for larger weapons (and some small increases to equip burden), Vitality increases your HP s you can take more hits, Endurance is your energy/stamina (as well as equip burden), Faith is your magic/mp, Luck increases drop rates, and Agility is increased damage for smaller weapons and I think also equip burden, but I can't remember (haven't done anything with Agility yet). You can place points freely.\n\nYou'll also need to spend experience points to get points to put into magic. Magics come in 3 types. Brawling, Deception, and Solace. You choose one at the start of the game and can't use the others at all for your first play through (I've read and heard that in NG+ you unlock a second tree and in NG++ you unlock the final tree). To go into each tree will be a bit too long with the characters I have left, but they are fairly unique from one another, but you'll never have a magic only character like in the Souls games.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun and has some nice adjustments to the Souls systems (like the timing/combo system or the 'blood pools' that contains your expedience on death being able to heal you if you stay near it, but draining the experience in it, etc), but is not at all like the Souls in its overall presentation. It's a good game that's only really marred by the crippling frame rates at points and the endless crashes.","October 30, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is weighty and more complex than you may think based on whatever youtube videos or live streams you have seen. There are numerous ways to cut up your enemies, be it with an axe, sword, mace or even a bloody polesword. Combining light and heavy attacks has varying results, which is complimented by dodging and sprinting attacks.\n\nNow, there are a couple important points I'd like to make, first regarding the claims of extreme game-breaking bugs and the second to its comparison to the Dark Souls franchise.\n\nThe bugs: After its release I am sure this game had numerous game breaking bugs; however I purchased the game recently and have only experienced a couple minor bugs that were fixed in a minute. I've had only had to restart the game once to fix a bug and that was because I was assumed a setting change that I had done would only work when restarting the game and it did. I am now about 10 hours into the game, 5 bosses down and have not have ONE crash. NOT ONE. So people, please start buying this game and get stuck in !\n\nEven better is its pause mechanic, which comes into play when minimizing. I have a fairly powerful gaming laptop (Lenovo Y510p), but some games do overheat such as this. When it gets hot, however, the game simply minimizes instead of crashes and when it does it PAUSES. So i have never died from an unwanted minimize.\n\nNOW - DARK SOULS...................... I can't believe the publics reaction to it being like dark souls. As someone who has beated Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 I can easily say that this game is a treat. Yes they are similar, but that's a good thing. Lords is merely inspired by the game and it really does differ greatly. Yes it has that timing-orientated combat, the powerful monster enemies and the bosses that can crush you. But it is not Dark Souls and varies greatly. It does include some aspects of Darksiders (although I never thought I'd admit this) in terms of graphics and the fact that in Dark Souls your aim is to not get hit and its pretty easy, but in Lords of the Fallen sometimes the best strategy is to take a few hits while jumping axe swinging into the enemey because you know thats his biggest opening (the tower shield guys)\n\nFirst, the good:\n\nThe ability to pause in game to either the home screen or your inventory. At first I thought this was a bit too much as it was something I had come to appreciate when playing Dark Souls, but then I realized how insanely irritating it was to not be able to pause in Dark Souls.\n\nCombat is powerful, complex, weighty and rewarding.\n\nAmazing current-gen graphics\n\nGreat music and sound effects\n\nIntricately designed areas and world\n\nBosses that are definitely fun and well thought out\n\nLabyrinthian Diablo like dungeons\n\nCut scenese with customizable dialouge and "last hit kill" cutscenes, which I felt were a niceish touch\n\nEach weapon has a unique and sick backstab action\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe bosses are sometimes too easy (e.g worshipper was great. Infiltrator was boring)\n\nSome bugs\n\nMaybe not enough 'outside' play, but there is some and its awesome.\n\nI have to go now though so i rushed this but ya BUY THIS GAME! :)\n\nWhere Dark Souls says "prepare to die" Lords of the Fallen says "prepare to get a lost and go crazy in a labyrinth" which to me is great because Souls 2 didnt have nearly enough castle gameplay and in Lords you get fully submerged in the depths and dungeons of medievil Cidatels\n\n\n\n","February 10, 2015","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purlox/recommended/265300/","purlox","Purlox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purlox/","181 products in account","(Note about me: I have played through Dark Souls 1 (162 hours played so far) and played a bit of Dark Souls 2 (43 hours played so far) as well.)\n\nI was really looking forward to this game, because I really like the Dark Souls style of games and combat, but rarely you see combat that's like that. So most likely I am biased towards a game like this.\n\nGameplay\nCombat\n\nThe combat is rather similar to Dark Souls, especially when it comes to melee weapons, but there are still differences. The melee combat felt as satisfying to me as in Dark Souls, so I would say it was pretty good.\n\nA big difference would be that there are no changeable ranged weapons. You only get your gauntlet near the start of the game and that's it. The gauntlet functions as a mix of a ranged weapon and also spell weapon as it drains your mana and isn't just simple projectile shooter weapon like a bow would be. It has 3 different modes, that are quite different from each other, and later on in the game you'll get the ability to further customize and change how the gauntlet works in each of the modes. Meaning that you aren't just changing the stats of the weapon, but rather you are changing what the projectiles do. (e.g. making a projectile attrack enemy attention, drain life, knockback enemies, etc.)\n\nOn the other hand there is a lot of melee weapons, but as you soon find out (especially after you get to socket runes into them), many of them are obsolete compared to other weapons. The only redeeming factor for the weapons might be their moveset, which can matter a lot to some people, but to me it wasn't enough of a tradeoff when I could be doing significantly more damage with the other weapon. So in the end I was finding that I had at max 4 viable weapons for myself when I played with a really heavily str focused build.\n\nAnother significant difference is that there is no way to be a mage like you could be in other games. There are no spells that do damage on their own, rather they usually support your combat skills or weaken the enemy, etc. The gauntlet might be able to compensate for that, but I'm not sure it would be enough. Especially because when the few times I tried how viable it would be to use it on its own, I found out that the shots consume too much mana and don't deal enough damage. This however might not be such a bad thing, because at least from my experience fighting ranged or with spells in a souls game (in pve at least) makes the game much more easier and less fun because you no longer have to get up close and have to be so careful when you attack near them because they could countera-attack you.\n\nOne thing I really missed though is the lack of PvP. Fighting others can be pretty fun in a game like this and it can create a lot of tension if you have a lot of souls on you at the time, but nothing like that can be found in this game. It was probably a conscious choice on the dev's part, but I think it could be more fun with it.\n\nI noticed a really big problem with the armors in this game. Later in the game when I had a decent amount of strength, I could equip the best and heaviest armor without any penalty and it made the game far too easy in my experience. Bosses were still difficult, but normal enemies did between 1/5th and 1/10th of what they did to me before, which was such a big decreese in damage that I stopped caring about getting damaged, because I could do that without being punished (even if I got hit). Not sure if this is a problem with how much points I put into strength or what, but it made the game less enjoyable and too easy in my experience.\n\nEnemies\n\nThe enemies looked interesting at first, but after a while I got bored of the Rhogar all looking the same and being pretty much the only enemies with few exceptions. The enemy variety got better near the end of the game with new enemies being introduced, so I wouldn't say it was that bad overall.\n\nThe cast of enemies certainly had some interesting enemies, for example the most fragile enemy can't see, so you can easily avoid them if you want to or ambush them.\n\nI think the bosses were great, much better than in pretty much any game including Dark Souls. Many of them had interesting mechanics tied to them or were somewhat different depending on how much health they had and apart from 1 bossfight you never had to fight multi-boss bossfight. And even that bossfight wasn't that bad because every once in a while one of them removed themselves from the fight, so you had to deal with only one of them at a time most of the time.\n\nOverall most melee enemies had big sweeping attacks that can also easily turn around or hit you when you are behind enemies, so you had to either roll to dodge or block, which I found a bit dissapointing, because I like being able to dodge enemies just with the right positioning and movement, but that wasn't possible.\n\nStory\nThe story seemed interesting, but I didn't pay that much mind to it and I think I missed important parts of it, so can't give a good opinion on it.\n\nOne thing I really didn't like on the story though is how one big important choice was presented in the game. It was rather contrived and felt forced, because how the choice was made, made it look like it's just a choice for how to use something given to you, that doesn't even affect how you will be able to use it after you select one of the choices, and yet it seems that choice chooses which one of the 3 endings you'll get.\n\nThe way it was given to you was more direct way than in Dark Souls. There are many cutscenes and conversations with characters, but also part of the story is conveyed through the environment and through scrolls that you pick up.\n\nSetting\n\nI found the setting interesting and I wouldn't mind exploring it more. Unfortunately, the game forced you to revisit old areas with new enemies, especially at the end of the game, instead of new areas, which was kinda dissapointing, because I wouldn't mind exploring more areas.\n\nNone of the areas came out as cohersive wholes and even though some of them looked rather nice, it often felt like they made a nice area and then randomly placed random minions there. Dark Souls in comparison has areas that have enemies in them that make sense for the areas, for example a lower area of one of the earlier areas you find yourself in is full of old houses that seem abandoned and damaged and the enemies in the area are lightly armored enemies with daggers that try to ambush you and work in groups.\n\nConclusion\nI think the game is really good, especially if you like the way Dark Souls combat works, but note that the game is much shorter than Dark Souls and besides the combat it's not like Dark Souls and if you don't mind that then I would recommend it.","February 11, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looked great! Stunning visuals and it came at a time when I had just finished Dark Souls 2 and its dlc's so it was a great transition.\n\nI waited a couple of days after release before I got the game as I wanted to gauge the general feeling. I noticed that a lot of people were slagging the game off because it was "trying" to be dark souls. Being a genre defining game its understandable that any subsequent games in that genre will be compared but that doesnt give people right to slag it off just because it's not a good. Anyway, mini rant over.\n\nThis game is very good. The graphics are stunning. At first I thought they were a littke blurry but I realised that it was just part of the art style. The combat is great. More aggressive than dark souls. Some of the regular enemies can be as difficult to get past as some bosses. In general, the game is relatively easy. There are a few hard spots that took a while to get that rhythm.  Nearly all the boss fights I finished on the first try with only 4 fights taking a couple more.\n\nThe story was largely a mystery until halfway through and some if the characters seemed randomly placed. Quests were unmarked and there was even a point where I had managed to face the 5th boss before I had found the 4th.\n\nThe magic was largely redundant. I only ever used one spell. Granted, I've only used the warrior spell tree so there could be others that would be useful. The magic gauntlet that is in the game seems just like an excuse to have something like a gun. Again, only one of the three modes seems remotely useful.\n\nThe boss fights were fun, despite being easy. They did have an element of challenge to them to a small degree. They were well designed and imaginative in the play styles and methods of combat.\n\nI remember some people mentioning that they had lots of crashing, like every 15 mins. In the 17hrs or so of play at time of writing I've only ever had 3 crashes and all of them happened in the same place for the exact same reason. For some reason, the pc couldnt handle an exploding troll midget in this small area. If I lured them out it was fine. If I fought them in the area, boom, crash. Since then, no problems.\n\nOverall, I would give the game a solid 7/10.\nPros;\n- Gorgeous graphics with a awesome setting\n- Well done combat with good balancing\n- The armour sets are badass\n- Bosses are inventive\n- Plenty of back story in the form of well done audio logs\n\nCons;\n- The story was good but the delivery could have been better. Often spent time wondering what was going on purely because of poor scripting.\n- Gaps in said story\n- Some boss battles too easy","November 4, 2014","true","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is it like Dark Souls? Sort of. (TL;DR at the end)\nBefore I start:Many people had problems with the performance, I started to play after patch 1.4 and everything was fine, no crashes, stable framerate.\nFirst of all the grapchics are great and the combat is pretty solid, animations look realistic but sometimes you can just stick close to an enemy and avoid getting hit. Regular enemies can get hard to kill because the window between their lowered guard is little, so if you have a greatsword you may have a hard time dealing with them.\nGame is also more forgiving in my opinion, if you are afraid of rolling you can go with a heavy armor that can absorb a lot of damage. The third boss got me becaus I was using Dark Souls techniques and tried rolling away but still getting hit, so I equiped the heaviest gear and tanked the boss and it actually worked.\nThere are 10 bosses, some are hard some are easy especially if you figure out their attack pattern. But the world has a lot of hidden treasures that you can try and find.\nIf you manage to beat all the bosses in the first attempt and not get stuck and lost for a long time you can complete the game in 10-12 hours.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\nIf there is a sale on this game and you like Dark Souls type games, give it a go, I don't think you will regret it.","January 29, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel strongly that this game is much better on PC than Dark Souls is, I was able to complete it with keyboard and mouse (not possible with Dark Souls).\n\nAlthough the game is said to be 18 hours long, it took me over 28 to complete. Maybe I'm slower than others (or worse).\n\nStill, in the end, this is a really good game. I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to any PC gamer looking for a high fedelity Dark Souls experience.\n\nA+","February 9, 2015","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is weighty and more complex than you may think based on whatever youtube videos or live streams you have seen. There are numerous ways to cut up your enemies, be it with an axe, sword, mace or even a bloody polesword. Combining light and heavy attacks has varying results, which is complimented by dodging and sprinting attacks.\n\nNow, there are a couple important points I'd like to make, first regarding the claims of extreme game-breaking bugs and the second to its comparison to the Dark Souls franchise.\n\nThe bugs: After its release I am sure this game had numerous game breaking bugs; however I purchased the game recently and have only experienced a couple minor bugs that were fixed in a minute. I've had only had to restart the game once to fix a bug and that was because I was assumed a setting change that I had done would only work when restarting the game and it did. I am now about 10 hours into the game, 5 bosses down and have not have ONE crash. NOT ONE. So people, please start buying this game and get stuck in !\n\nEven better is its pause mechanic, which comes into play when minimizing. I have a fairly powerful gaming laptop (Lenovo Y510p), but some games do overheat such as this. When it gets hot, however, the game simply minimizes instead of crashes and when it does it PAUSES. So i have never died from an unwanted minimize.\n\nNOW - DARK SOULS...................... I can't believe the publics reaction to it being like dark souls. As someone who has beated Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 I can easily say that this game is a treat. Yes they are similar, but that's a good thing. Lords is merely inspired by the game and it really does differ greatly. Yes it has that timing-orientated combat, the powerful monster enemies and the bosses that can crush you. But it is not Dark Souls and varies greatly. It does include some aspects of Darksiders (although I never thought I'd admit this) in terms of graphics and the fact that in Dark Souls your aim is to not get hit and its pretty easy, but in Lords of the Fallen sometimes the best strategy is to take a few hits while jumping axe swinging into the enemey because you know thats his biggest opening (the tower shield guys)\n\nFirst, the good:\n\nThe ability to pause in game to either the home screen or your inventory. At first I thought this was a bit too much as it was something I had come to appreciate when playing Dark Souls, but then I realized how insanely irritating it was to not be able to pause in Dark Souls.\n\nCombat is powerful, complex, weighty and rewarding.\n\nAmazing current-gen graphics\n\nGreat music and sound effects\n\nIntricately designed areas and world\n\nBosses that are definitely fun and well thought out\n\nLabyrinthian Diablo like dungeons\n\nCut scenese with customizable dialouge and "last hit kill" cutscenes, which I felt were a niceish touch\n\nEach weapon has a unique and sick backstab action\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe bosses are sometimes too easy (e.g worshipper was great. Infiltrator was boring)\n\nSome bugs\n\nMaybe not enough 'outside' play, but there is some and its awesome.\n\nI have to go now though so i rushed this but ya BUY THIS GAME! :)\n\nWhere Dark Souls says "prepare to die" Lords of the Fallen says "prepare to get a lost and go crazy in a labyrinth" which to me is great because Souls 2 didnt have nearly enough castle gameplay and in Lords you get fully submerged in the depths and dungeons of medievil Cidatels\n\n\n\n","February 10, 2015","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purlox/recommended/265300/","purlox","Purlox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purlox/","181 products in account","(Note about me: I have played through Dark Souls 1 (162 hours played so far) and played a bit of Dark Souls 2 (43 hours played so far) as well.)\n\nI was really looking forward to this game, because I really like the Dark Souls style of games and combat, but rarely you see combat that's like that. So most likely I am biased towards a game like this.\n\nGameplay\nCombat\n\nThe combat is rather similar to Dark Souls, especially when it comes to melee weapons, but there are still differences. The melee combat felt as satisfying to me as in Dark Souls, so I would say it was pretty good.\n\nA big difference would be that there are no changeable ranged weapons. You only get your gauntlet near the start of the game and that's it. The gauntlet functions as a mix of a ranged weapon and also spell weapon as it drains your mana and isn't just simple projectile shooter weapon like a bow would be. It has 3 different modes, that are quite different from each other, and later on in the game you'll get the ability to further customize and change how the gauntlet works in each of the modes. Meaning that you aren't just changing the stats of the weapon, but rather you are changing what the projectiles do. (e.g. making a projectile attrack enemy attention, drain life, knockback enemies, etc.)\n\nOn the other hand there is a lot of melee weapons, but as you soon find out (especially after you get to socket runes into them), many of them are obsolete compared to other weapons. The only redeeming factor for the weapons might be their moveset, which can matter a lot to some people, but to me it wasn't enough of a tradeoff when I could be doing significantly more damage with the other weapon. So in the end I was finding that I had at max 4 viable weapons for myself when I played with a really heavily str focused build.\n\nAnother significant difference is that there is no way to be a mage like you could be in other games. There are no spells that do damage on their own, rather they usually support your combat skills or weaken the enemy, etc. The gauntlet might be able to compensate for that, but I'm not sure it would be enough. Especially because when the few times I tried how viable it would be to use it on its own, I found out that the shots consume too much mana and don't deal enough damage. This however might not be such a bad thing, because at least from my experience fighting ranged or with spells in a souls game (in pve at least) makes the game much more easier and less fun because you no longer have to get up close and have to be so careful when you attack near them because they could countera-attack you.\n\nOne thing I really missed though is the lack of PvP. Fighting others can be pretty fun in a game like this and it can create a lot of tension if you have a lot of souls on you at the time, but nothing like that can be found in this game. It was probably a conscious choice on the dev's part, but I think it could be more fun with it.\n\nI noticed a really big problem with the armors in this game. Later in the game when I had a decent amount of strength, I could equip the best and heaviest armor without any penalty and it made the game far too easy in my experience. Bosses were still difficult, but normal enemies did between 1/5th and 1/10th of what they did to me before, which was such a big decreese in damage that I stopped caring about getting damaged, because I could do that without being punished (even if I got hit). Not sure if this is a problem with how much points I put into strength or what, but it made the game less enjoyable and too easy in my experience.\n\nEnemies\n\nThe enemies looked interesting at first, but after a while I got bored of the Rhogar all looking the same and being pretty much the only enemies with few exceptions. The enemy variety got better near the end of the game with new enemies being introduced, so I wouldn't say it was that bad overall.\n\nThe cast of enemies certainly had some interesting enemies, for example the most fragile enemy can't see, so you can easily avoid them if you want to or ambush them.\n\nI think the bosses were great, much better than in pretty much any game including Dark Souls. Many of them had interesting mechanics tied to them or were somewhat different depending on how much health they had and apart from 1 bossfight you never had to fight multi-boss bossfight. And even that bossfight wasn't that bad because every once in a while one of them removed themselves from the fight, so you had to deal with only one of them at a time most of the time.\n\nOverall most melee enemies had big sweeping attacks that can also easily turn around or hit you when you are behind enemies, so you had to either roll to dodge or block, which I found a bit dissapointing, because I like being able to dodge enemies just with the right positioning and movement, but that wasn't possible.\n\nStory\nThe story seemed interesting, but I didn't pay that much mind to it and I think I missed important parts of it, so can't give a good opinion on it.\n\nOne thing I really didn't like on the story though is how one big important choice was presented in the game. It was rather contrived and felt forced, because how the choice was made, made it look like it's just a choice for how to use something given to you, that doesn't even affect how you will be able to use it after you select one of the choices, and yet it seems that choice chooses which one of the 3 endings you'll get.\n\nThe way it was given to you was more direct way than in Dark Souls. There are many cutscenes and conversations with characters, but also part of the story is conveyed through the environment and through scrolls that you pick up.\n\nSetting\n\nI found the setting interesting and I wouldn't mind exploring it more. Unfortunately, the game forced you to revisit old areas with new enemies, especially at the end of the game, instead of new areas, which was kinda dissapointing, because I wouldn't mind exploring more areas.\n\nNone of the areas came out as cohersive wholes and even though some of them looked rather nice, it often felt like they made a nice area and then randomly placed random minions there. Dark Souls in comparison has areas that have enemies in them that make sense for the areas, for example a lower area of one of the earlier areas you find yourself in is full of old houses that seem abandoned and damaged and the enemies in the area are lightly armored enemies with daggers that try to ambush you and work in groups.\n\nConclusion\nI think the game is really good, especially if you like the way Dark Souls combat works, but note that the game is much shorter than Dark Souls and besides the combat it's not like Dark Souls and if you don't mind that then I would recommend it.","February 11, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In order to truly get a good idea on what Lords of the Fallen is like, we need to look to a game called "Dark Souls" to explain it's gameplay. LotF sets out to be difficult from the get go, forcing the player into positions where patience is rewarded over arrogance. This would be decent enough, if not for the severe lack of content, or seeming lack of it. The game seems to suffer from a major pacing issue, and atmosphere issue, that Dark Souls does not. While Lords takes a lot of it's inspiration from the Souls series, from it's combat, to it's attempt (but ultimate failure) at recreating the frustratingly hard difficulty level of Souls, to it's story; it doesn't bring the atmosphere of severe hopelessness, and the feeling of just barely being able to trudge along into the next area of the game. The Warrior is capable of tanking so many blows it's just way too easy, the Cleric does way too much damage right out of the gate, and the Rogue is way too quick for his own good.\nThat being said, the game is fun, it's just not what you've probably heard. It's easier than Dark Souls, way more forgiving, in a world that is attempting to recreate a hopeless environment and ultimately fails, making you feel like a total ♥♥♥♥ing badass instead of a total ♥♥♥♥ing pushover, but it's fun. I'll recommend it to anyone who enjoys their time with RPGs.\n\nFor a number? How about 7/10. Solid, but could easily improve.","November 28, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes I do.\nPlease note, that I went into this game with the following expecations: It's not  Dark Souls and my general expectations were pretty low given the fact that it's made by CI and Deck 13, neither of wich has an overly "good" portfolio or reputation.\nSo, how's the game? If I had to give it a score, I'd say it's a solid 7.5/10. Basically, it's the best game both studios ever produced (IMHO). Yes, it takes a lot from Dark Souls or Demon Souls, but at the same time it does make a stand on it's own. The game is not about the story, of the characters, but it's about the killing, and the loot. When you strike an enemy with your mace, or great axe - you can "feel" the weight under your attack. When you roll - you feel the "weight" of your character and the armor that he is wearing. Think of it as "kids" friendly Dark Souls meets DarkSiders 2, and you'll get LotF.\n\nPros:\nNice visuals\nNice sound\nGood "atmosphere"/setting\nSolid gameplay mechanics.\nVisually-appealing loot (the visual appearance of weapons and armor)\nIT IS PLAYABLE (COMFORTABLY) with Mouse and Keyboard.\nCons:\nA bland story\nWorld needs more flashing-out, and scribe-scrolls allone don't do a particularly great job\nNeed a bigger variety of environment. Sure, there are some cool scenery, but usually you end up running down the corridor # 325 and entering the room # 151.\nProjectile magic is kinda usless, towards the end of the game (gauntlet).\nRegular Soldiers are just scenery, they won't do ANYTHING even if you kite 3 mobs up their face.\n\n\n\n","November 5, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly, the game lags unexpectedly in some places and has crashed a couple of times (One resulting in a pc restart, which I thought was odd), and secondly, when replaying the game, the fact that loot isn't randomized can get a little bit boring as you begin to know what is where. However, now that I have that out of the way, I can get onto the good points.\n\nThis game is a great alternative if you want a game that plays like Dark Souls, but is a more western style Action-RPG. I love the armour and how bulky everything is, it reminded me, in a way, of the first fable games, with the ridiculously large hammers that you could wield! The classes are nicely varied, and the xp system (getting xp to a checkpoint and getting larger xp modifiers for surviving while holding a large amount of xp) was very satisfying, and felt rewarding when you go on a big monster massacre and actually come out of it alive.\n\nThe bosses are all very varied, and if you bother to pick up some of the extra lore, such as audio-thingies, they can be interesting to learn about too! They are all challenging in their own ways and require a certain amount of tactics to beat them. The story line itself is nice, the lip syncing and voice acting was average, but I liked the fact that you have choices in conversations, some of them actually affecting the outcome of certain situations.\n\nLords of the fallen - 9/10\n\nTL;DR - The game has some performance issues at the moment, and I feel spoilt by randomized loot in other games when I play this, but the armour it gives you is very chunky and makes your character look like a boss. Speaking of bosses, they are varied and fun to beat, the story is also pretty good so far!","December 31, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some other times it stutters with no apparent reason (CPU/GPU well under 50% utilization). Some say it's the new DRM Denuvo which causes all those problems, i dunno.

I'm talking about the no-animation, teleport-y kind of turning around, allowing them to immediately attack you again without giving you an opening to attack them without being hit yourself.\n\nIt's also too easy to get stunlocked to death by groups of enemies. Sure, it's more "realistic" if one knock to the ground can immediately mean your death due to multiple enemies being able to still attack/hurt you when you're in a helpless position, but it's not at all fun, or indeed fair. If you die in Dark Souls, you know it's your fault, and you know what you can do to prevent it from happening next time. Further to the point, if you get swarmed by a group, your first instinct would be to retreat and take them on in a more tactical sense, right? In LotF it only takes a nudge for you to get stunlocked enough to suddenly get surrounded, and then you're done for, as there are no i-frames when rolling.\n\nIn LotF, you're forced to play tanky and take hits, as going the light route is simply a massive handicap, due to dodging not being as refined as in Dark Souls. So a lot of the time it's luck as to whether you're going to win a fight or not, or whether the enemy you're fighting is going to poise straight through your well-timed heavy and land you on your ♥♥♥ for a grizzly death. So a lot of the time you're relying on your health and defense in order to survive such things, and hopefully dole out more damage to them than they can to you.\n\nDespite this, I would recommend LotF, just don't expect to be able to play like you can in Dark Souls, and don't expect the kind of well-crafted mechanics or indeed interesting lore/characters that Dark Souls is known for.

The XP system is top notch - high risk / high rewards and if you don't overjump your skill you WILL find your perfect balance.\n\nBoss fights are a bit too straight forward. Let me explain they are far from easy but anyone that applies some patience and methodical movement will beat every boss (for now haven't finished the game so can't talk 100% yet) in 2-4 tries. In my experience DS2 is "hard" mostly because of the extreme amount of damage the bosses do, the mechanics GENERALLY bored me. Here you got decent mechanics and the bosses do more damage than normal but not in the extreme. I'm thinking NG+ will be a different animal unless you outlevel it like I did without farming just exploring EVERYTHING on normal!\n\nI am exploring everything possible and every bonus stage and most deaths I account to judgement and lack of skill at that moment rather than controls or mechanics(those are SPOT on).\n\nGraphics - jaw dropping even on high, next week my GTX980 will arrive and I will add a comment about the very high setting.\n\nSound design is really good and everything is fleshed out very well, the weapon to shield clunk is sooooooo good.\n\nAll in all I am loving the game and will defo replay it, DS2 was my kind of gameplay my the japanese influence is just not my taste, also the extremely vague story was just blah.\n\nMy thoughts on the two major criticisms the game is getting:\nStability - I guess it is very personal because the game is stable and I am getting constant fps around the 40-60 mark which is great for the graphics, and SOME very rare 35s which disappear and I cannot replicate.\n\nDifficulty - for me the game is just as hards as DS\nDS players are alreay used to the combat style so it will seem easier to them.","January 23, 2015","true","41.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The XP system is top notch - high risk / high rewards and if you don't overjump your skill you WILL find your perfect balance.\n\nBoss fights are a bit too straight forward. Let me explain they are far from easy but anyone that applies some patience and methodical movement will beat every boss (for now haven't finished the game so can't talk 100% yet) in 2-4 tries. In my experience DS2 is "hard" mostly because of the extreme amount of damage the bosses do, the mechanics GENERALLY bored me. Here you got decent mechanics and the bosses do more damage than normal but not in the extreme. I'm thinking NG+ will be a different animal unless you outlevel it like I did without farming just exploring EVERYTHING on normal!\n\nI am exploring everything possible and every bonus stage and most deaths I account to judgement and lack of skill at that moment rather than controls or mechanics(those are SPOT on).\n\nGraphics - jaw dropping even on high, next week my GTX980 will arrive and I will add a comment about the very high setting.\n\nSound design is really good and everything is fleshed out very well, the weapon to shield clunk is sooooooo good.\n\nAll in all I am loving the game and will defo replay it, DS2 was my kind of gameplay my the japanese influence is just not my taste, also the extremely vague story was just blah.\n\nMy thoughts on the two major criticisms the game is getting:\nStability - I guess it is very personal because the game is stable and I am getting constant fps around the 40-60 mark which is great for the graphics, and SOME very rare 35s which disappear and I cannot replicate.\n\nDifficulty - for me the game is just as hards as DS\nDS players are alreay used to the combat style so it will seem easier to them.","January 23, 2015","true","41.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Playing it through a second time now, might loot something more interesting this time round, I hope!\n\nI only have a few complaints:\nBad story telling. A lot of decissions in the game I wasn't aware I made because they weren't explained clearly and there were times I wasn't sure what was going on, for instance (warning, spoilers in this blocked out text): The opening scene which I still don't fully understand even after finishing the game. Is it meant to be a flash back? Whats up with the hammer? Is it Harkyn or someone else? The giant demon who I thought was a fallen lord that vanishes with Yetka, what was that all about!?? And after the talk with Adyr you return to the citadel only to be attacked by the human soldiers, calling you a traitor for no reason. This is later explained a bit by picking up a scroll, but only after hacking through a small army of good guys you don't want to kill. And the mountain in the opening and at the end, what is it supposed to be and why did it break/fall apart?\n\nExtremely light crafting system. It would have been awesome if the crafting sytem let you craft gear instead of just unlocking runes and socketing gear, the smith looks more than capable. You can't combine lower quality runes to make better ones, but maybe this was intentional to keep the flawless runes a rare thing.\n\nLuck stat/drop modifier doesn't seem to work. It just increases the frequency of rubbish dropping, doesn't increase the quality of drops.\nHaving said that though, I still highly recommend this game! :)","November 5, 2014","true","35.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sfsibisc/recommended/265300/","sfsibisc","Silas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sfsibisc/","260 products in account","Don't let your decision wether to buy this game be influenced by the "Mixed" status of the user reviews. Most of the bad reviews are not actually about the game, they are rage reviews by people who experienced crashes and technical issues that have for the most part been solved in recent patches and will be addressed further in patches to come. I and many others can play this game without any problems. It's just that customers who are content with a product are much less likely to write a review about it than discontent ones. I just wanted to bring a little balance to that.\n\nThe game is often accused of being a Dark Souls ripoff. That's not entirely false, but it doesn't really cover what this game is. Lords of the Fallens approach to combat is basically copied from Dark Souls with a few subtle differences you will only notice after playing for a while ... and why not? Hardly any game did combat as good as Dark Souls did. And that's where the similarities end. The level design, the approach to character progression and a few other things, like UI and so forth, all that is new in Lords of the Fallen. It's still inspired by other games, like Darksiders, but most games we love build on concepts other games have introduced in the past, don't they?\n\nAnother famous argument against this game: "It is too slow". In fact, it's not that much slower than Dark Souls. People just tend to start the game in the heavy tanking warrior kind of starting gear, which is full plate armor, and they think that's the pace of the game. As a rogue you can roll and sprint and jump all over the place in absolutely sufficient speed, believe me.\n\nThe most important thing to me is that Lords of the Fallen is fun to play! It's modern in all the parts, where being old school doesn't bring any benefit: presentation, controls, interface ... but it's old school wherever it's important: the challenge, telling you only the basics and letting you figure out the rest, lots of secrets! Yes, it has a few design flaws: there's one particular move in the shield + one-handed moveset that allows for exploitation so that most enemies can be beaten effortlessly. That's Something the developers definitely have to nerf in a future patch. Boss fights are not as varied as in Darksiders or Dark Souls, though still fun an challenging they feel somewhat repetitive. Also there are neither the dramatic dialogues Darksiders had nor the intriguing lore of Lordran (Dark Souls), but what people tend to forget to mention in reviews is how much fun they had playing: I had tons of it.\n\nObjectively I have to admit that this is inferior to both Dark Souls and Darksiders, but in fact I feel much more like playing Lords of the Fallen most of the time, than I feel like playing Dark Souls. Lords gives the same challenges and emotional rewards for beating them without being as overwhelming. This game is pretty good at tying you to the computer: "Gotta get back my experience points after dying", "gotta beat this boss", "gotta hunt loot Diablo-style", "gotta find the secret way to this area over there", "gotta find the key to this door/chest", "gotta grind me a new level up", "oh I heard I get a unique armor/weapon when I do this while fighting that enemy", and so forth. It does this no worse that Dark Souls or Darksiders and I got to say it looks better while doing it.\n\nImportant info: Although the combat works much better with mouse and keyboard than in any Dark Souls game, you're still much better off with a gamepad. In fact you can add an XBox 360 controller to the requirement list.\n\nSo TL;DR, this is my thumbs up for a great, challenging Action-RPG that is best described as a blend of Dark Souls and Darksiders, with minor flaws but lots of fun to be had.\n\nGoodbye.","January 3, 2015","true","33.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lords of the fallen is trying to make an entry into the same genre as Dark Souls, with a lot of similarities,\nbut also some cool differences.\nI have more than 600 hours in Dark souls 1 and 2. Lords of the Fallen has fun bosses, weapons, armor, and the labyrinth DLC adds a fun puzzle. As a dark souls 1 and 2 onebro, I actually think doing a level 10 LOTF run would be harder, if you are worried it will be too easy of a game, Please support this game when it is on sale, and allow for the rest of the world to enter the HCARPG market without a unwarranted fear of failure.

(Still better than ME3 ending)\n- Magic is basically a cannon with only a few good moves you can use to cheese the game\n\nTLDR;  Dark Soulslike. Good game, but not for everyone.

In many ways it takes on from Dark Souls 2 rather than Dark Souls 1, which in my opinion is a bad thing.\n\nPros -\n* Great graphics.\n* Game flows decently if kind of slowly.\n* Voice acting is spot on.\n* Weapons are pretty neat, if you can actually use them.\n\nCons -\n* All weapons are slow. Save perhaps for daggers and smaller weapons, anything bigger than a stick takes a good second to swing regardless of whether it's a normal version or a great (large) version.\n* It's rather unfair at times. Took me probably an hour just to beat the first boss because he simply turtled the entire time and I was stuck with a one-handed hammer that took a second to swing each time I tried to attack.

Combat is, well, plodding is the best term I can think of, especially early on. It doesn't have the mysterious feel of the world like you get in a Souls game. Lack of multiplayer seems like it will hurt replayability, though the light/medium/heavy combat styles with the three flavors of magic are different enough they may be worth trying out.\n\nI do have an issue, as other's have mentioned, with the attack window. The larger enemies are too adept at bringing up their shield and spinning around, and so the opportunity to attack feels really small, and can get frustating at times.\n\nA number of people have had crashing issue, but I have yet to see one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omeron/recommended/265300/","Omeron","Omeron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omeron/","451 products in account","first and foremost if you want to play the genre but arnt ready for dark souls this is a good starting place. It has all the elements of the dark souls series except ranged weapons, which in my opinion was good as range often made dark souls much easier, so this is kind of forced melee learning if you arnt used to it. this game is as advertised, its an easier dark souls game. This game also simplifies a lot of the dark souls non-combat mechanics such as weapons and armors dont get upgrades, but instead they have runes that can be unsocketed and resocketed as many times as you want. experience is also simplified as  you can dump all your xp at save points so that you dont drop it on death. now for my negatives about it... the game itself crashed on me 5 times, causing me to redo things (such as bosses). almost all of the bosses had some gimmick that you needed to learn in order to beat them making bosses and the occasional ledge the only ways i died. after i finished the game i looked at how other people beat some of those bosses, and apparently i missed 75% of the health potions in the game(and i still beat the game without dying more than twice to the same boss). due to gimmicks there were a few bosses that didnt feel like bosses, but instead just enemies with extra health. this game is short, if i didnt have to redo parts due to crashes my playthrough would have been about 10 hours, however if you are new the the genre this could be much longer. i also have a few issues with the combat, mainly about shields. In the souls series you can attack immediately after a block, and enemies follow the same rules as the player. In this game however there is a lag between blocking and attacking, but the enemies dont follow this rule leading to shield enemies blocking your attacks then immediately attacking you back. In dark souls 2 they addressed this problem by replacing the kick with a shield break attack, however even though this game is mechanically similar to dark souls they didnt add it in. Due to all the sheild enemies and the sheild mechanics not working the same for the player i ended up just 2 handing  weapons with lots of poise. This poise allowed me to take a hit or two while i bashed on their shield a few times causing them to recoil which allowed me to actually hit them. I didnt do any backtracking or farming, nor did i look anything up, and i say this because early on i felt like my weapons were way too weak. finding a good weapon really made a huge difference. i complain about this because you are supposed to have a choice with weapons. In dark souls weapons are a preference based on your attributes, but two weapons of the same type will do similar damage, however in this game i got a sword off the first boss and compared to the sword i ended with it dealt five times less damage. the weapons dont appear to be balanced off stats, but rather where you are in the game which allows enemies to scale poorly. the enemies in one area might die in one hit, while the enemies in another area might die in ten hits. the armors in the game also scaled weirdly as large jumps in poise and armor wernt matched with large jumps in weight. there were some medium armors that after being socketed were just better than heavy armor found in the same area. the game give you a gauntet to cast ranged shots at the cost of mana, but i found that after i got a ranged class spell i pretty much stopped using it as the class spell was just hands down better. lastly there were times that enemies attacked or shot through walls leading to taking extra that i wasnt expecting. i might play through this game again, but im going to wait a while and see if they fix the crashing bugs and some of the attacking through walls bugs. so if you havent bought this game yet, but want to eventually, wait for it to go on sale at a later time, minimally after the crashing bugs have been fixed.","November 7, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I don't have the BEST graphics card, but I had it maxed out and stayed at 60fps all the time.\n-The armor and art style in this game are incredible.  Absolutely beautiful backdrops and awesome armor.\n-Pretty solid gameplay, Definitely provides one hell of a challenge.\n\nCons:\n-The combat is annoying ONLY because you get animation locked during attacks.  Literally everytime I died or got hit is because once you click attack it literally takes like 3 seconds to swing a big axe.  In that time as you're winding up (unable to cancel and dodge) you will get WRECKED by npcs.\n- Difficulty.  Yes, this is a baby to Dark Souls and a lot of people REALLY enjoy the challenge, but dang... I got stuck on the fourth boss and just COULD NOT beat it because of the animation locks, inability to dodge etc and it just got to the point where it went from a great challenge, to screw it i don't care anymore.\n-LAUGHABLE voice acting/mouth animations.  Holy cow.  So cliche and it's like the game was made for the korean language or something because the mouth movements don't really match what's being said.\n\nIn the end, if you want a really beautiful game and a dark souls type experience, this is a great game, but sometimes the animation locks alone made me rage quit.  Once you get to a certain level however, the game DOES get a bit easier, both due to better gear and finally learning attack patterns etc.  I definitely had fun even if the story and voice acting is a little funky.\n\nBit of advice:  Cast your prayer where they attack your double and just kill things from behind them if you're stuck!","April 15","true","19.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But the reason you are here is because you like Dark Souls combat and progression.\nThis implements something similar to Dark Souls 1's combat and progression system, but personally, I think they've actually done a better job with it.\n\nAlso, I think the bosses I've encountered so far have been brilliantly designed.  They don't look interesting at first glance, but actually fighting each one takes a completely unique stratagy that you have to figure out as you go, which is really quite satisfying.\n\nSo, if that is all you want, get it.\n\nHOWEVER, if you want the rish story and varied vistas of darksouls... well you're not going to get it.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: While you may be able to run this game at max settings using your current CPU and GPU, I'd take a look at your RAM.  This game eats up a lot of it.  I recommend 16GB for max settings and 8GB for min to avoid thrashing.  At 8GB on max graphics, it was clear my CPU and GPU were fine, but every now and then It would freeze for a bit.  which indicated that something was being transfered to/from the disk.  After checking the the tsk manager, I found that I was using nearly 7GB of the 8 on my computer.  Since then I have upgraded my RAM to 16GB, and it runs at a smooth 60fps now.\n\nThe level design is pretty good, and IMO is better than Dark Souls 2's level design. However, level design is not the same as the visual design.  Some people don't like the visual design since there isn't a ton of definition, but I think it's fine that way.  It just means you can't play with your eye's closed. Overall, that is pretty much the theme of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouslyjack/recommended/265300/","seriouslyjack","Bailey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouslyjack/","37 products in account","I've had people ask me for a review on this game, and so here you are. I currently have 40 hours on the game. The review will go in order as Gameplay, Features and Story, Environment & NPCs. Scroll down to the final paragraph if you want to skip the lengthy text.\n\nGameplayNo character customization is available in LotF, instead you play as Harkyn, a sturdy man with facial hair and a bald head. You have a selection of 3 different magic classes and then 3 different builds, ultimately giving 9 choices if you look at it that way. Magic classes each have 3 unique abilities that you can unlock and use throughout the game, as well as a fourth ability that is the same for each class, called Prayer, which creates a statue that your enemies will attack. Your build choice simply affects what stats you start with and what weapon/armour you face the first boss with. The magic classes are as follows:\n\nSolace, or better known as cleric, the slower and middle-grounded of the three.    Shelter gives you increased defense and slowly regenerates your health.\nDaze slows and lowers the defence of enemies around you, a very useful ability against mobs that hide behind a shield.\nPunishment returns enemy attacks by stunning and dealing damage back to them.Deception, or better known as rogue, is the stealthy single-target magic class. My personal favourite.    Mimic creates a phase of you that copies everything you do, making it that each attack hits twice for a certain amount of time.\nStab sends a phase sprinting towards your targetted enemy and deals damage to them, best used as a finisher imo.\nShift makes Harkyn become invisible and silent for a period of time, increasing your movement speed. His next attack, unless a backstab, will deal a large amount of damage and bring him out of stealth.Brawler magic class, or better known as warrior. The brute of the three.    Rage increases your attack power and damage as well as removing energy restrictions.\nRam sends a charging force through your enemy, staggering or knocking them down while dealing a small amount of damage.\nQuake is a close ranged ability that creates a huge hammer to slam down in front of you, devestating any enemies near you.When you use an ability, it shares a cooldown with every other ability, meaning you cannot use two at once. You have to choose which ability is best to use at that moment, and then wait for your cooldown or mana to regenerate. Once you choose a class, you cannot change this throughout the game, but when you reach NG+ you are able to choose a second class to master the abilities of. I chose rogue, and then warrior on NG+, and of course cleric on NG++, ultimately getting every ability in the game.\n\nThe combat is "clunkier" than Dark Souls combat, as you may of already heard. Rolling is a little slower but still fairly easy to learn. Blocking is an effective mechanic, too. There isn't much to fault it with it's just not quite as exhilarating as Dark Souls, doesn't have as steep of a learning curve and severe difficulty. I died on one or two bosses a few times, but overall didn't find the game too difficult.\n\nThere are different weapons such as staves, greatswords, swords, daggers etc and typically each different type of weapon is for a different stat, I.E. greatswords for strength or shortswords for agility. Problem is, in each weapon type, they're all practically the same. It's rare that one greatsword would have a different moveset than another greatsword, just a different appearance and damage. This brings me to stats. There is a stat for health, equipment load and energy, mana, strength, agility, and oddly a stat called luck which increases the chance of drops or rare runes (runes are socketed in to weapons to affect them in different ways). I didn't use luck and I would assume it's a near useless stat.\n\nThere is light armour, medium armour and heavy armour. There is no reason you can't mix between them to look good or get the equipment burden you want. There is fast-roll, mid-roll and fat-roll just like Dark Souls. But unlike in Dark Souls, mid-roll and fat-roll are perfectly viable- heavy armour makes a significant difference in the damage you take, plus the fact that shields are effective too.\n\nThere is also stealth in the game, with the help of rogue abilities and light armour, you can move up to an enemy slowly and surprise them with a backstab or just with a normal swing of your weapon. I really enjoyed this, I personally love stealth and Dark Souls didn't master this element.\n\nFeaturesYou have a lot of the fundamental features that Dark Souls had. If you die, you drop your experience and have to go back to the spot you died to retrieve it, unless if you use a retrieval consumable to instantly get that experience back. There is NG+, which is where you game restarts after you complete it but you keep your level and equipment, plus the lovely feature of choosing a second magic class.\n\nLotF surprised me a few times with the features it implemented. Features that would of been fantastic in the Souls series. One of which is that the more enemies you kill without resting at a checkpoint or dying, the more experience you get, giving veterens a solid reason to be risky. My personal favourite is that each boss drops a boss weapon, but here's the cool part, each boss also has a unique challenge that if you complete during the fight then you get an even stronger weapon than it would of dropped originally.\n\nStory, Graphics & NPCsThe story is... meh. Nothing to praise nor bash, it doesn't shock you but it keeps things flowing. It gives you a reason to move on and get through the new area, and then the next, and then the next. The jist of it is that an army of demons named the Rhogar are attacking, you were released from prison to help stop these attacks with the aid of your closest buddy, Kaslo. There is a twist near the end, though.\n\nGraphics are good. The areas aren't incredibly varied. You have the edges of the citadel with cold mountains in the distance, a catacombs area with narrow passageways and also an alternative realm which kind of feels like the only alternative scenery. The enemies also aren't incredibly varied, the majority of the game is just different sized humanoids, but there are some spooky looking ones throughout to keep it entertaining.\n\nNPCs are insignificant. I mentioned Kaslo before, he is one of two NPCs that you interact with more than twice, the other being a typical female warrior character that is super cocky and cheeky to our protagonist so you think "huh, she's female but she isn't scared of me, I like her". She turns out to have a story you can impact negatively or positively, based on your choice. There are a few other NPCs that have minor quests for you to do and will give you something in return, but nothing very memorable. NPCs are average at best.\n\n\nTL;DRWell, in conclusion, Lords of the Fallen is a solid game but lacks replayability. You'll probably fight through NG+ not only because you want to try a different playstyle, but also because the game is so god damn short you feel like you owe it to yourself. The different combat styles are varied enough to keep it entertaining for a while, but not for long, especially since weapons grow boring.\n\nI personally enjoyed it, though. Easily getting 40 hours out of it and for a reasonable price, I don't regret the purchase, although I am now bored of the game and moving on to other games. If you're a fan of this type of RPG, Dark Souls being a prime example, then go for it, but it won't fill the void that Dark Souls left in you. Sorry about that, buddy.\n\n7/10.","June 23, 2015","true","42.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Mine also presented itself with a nice "has stopped working" intro, but... After I had managed to fix that and actually start up the game, I fell in love with it. The dark fantasy setting, armor and weapon designs, everything fits in nicely, and the combat is something I hadn't even dared to hope for. You see, I tried to play Dark Souls and would have probably loved the game, if only the developers weren't so damn lazy and Dark Souls' PC port wasn't one of the worst I've had the "pleasure" of attempting to play.\n\nFor all of you who would be scared that Lords of the Fallen is unplayable without a controller, take heart. It's working just great with a mouse and a keyboard, something Dark Souls hasn't come close to even with the "mouse and keyboard fix/mod" whatever. I can certainly see some inspiration and there's a strong similarity here, sure, but Lords of the Fallen wins it all for me. I won't budge when a developer forces me to use a method of control that isn't readily available nor preferable for most PC gamers.\n\nAlright, enough comparing the two games, let's get to what you can expect when you pick up Lords of the Fallen. Well, I'm not that far in myself yet, so I can't really divulge too much. But I can tell you I was fighting the first boss for an hour last night (refused to use potions) and I was having a great fun. There's just one attack that seemed to be dodgeable more based on luck that anything else, which kinda infuriated me, but other than that, the game seems fair when it comes to difficulty.\n\nThe melee combat is what I personally enjoy most about the game, and it's one of the main reasons for which I bought it. Another being its grittiness and somewhat beautiful art design and dark fantasy setting. Every strike you make with your weapon carries weight. It doesn't reach further than the length of your weapon, if you swing a huge two-handed axe with one hand, it puts you off balance and leaves you open for a counter attack for a while, it's really all amazing. Especially it's a hell of a change for veterans of games like Darksiders, like myself. Controls get in your blood very quickly, plus they're all rebindable and there are even many possible presets.\n\nComplaints about the game? Well... the initial "has stopped working" aside, I haven't had a single crash so far in over 3 hours playtime (I do tend to get quite frequent crashes on Dragon Age: Inquisition and still I think it's a great game!). I agree it is a serious problem and the developers should work their butts off to fix it asap, but it doesn't diminish qualities of the game objectively. I didn't experience performance problems either, I'm running the game in 1920x1080 resolution (my wide screen's native), with pretty much everything set on high, anisotropic filtering at 8x I think, with V-Sync on, on my gaming rig with Intel i5-4430 CPU, 8 GB RAM, and nVidia GTX 760. The game might not be the best looking game ever, but I personally enjoy the graphics and animations very much. I really miss a map though, that's a bit of a nuisance.\n\nSo the conclusion, knowing what I do now, I wouldn't have minded paying full price for the game to support the developer, because they've done some excellent work on this title, finally making this type of games available to die hard mouse/keyboard users to enjoy. If you have doubts, pick it up during a sale and give it a go.\n\nRating:\nGraphics - 8\nSounds - 9\nMusic - 7\nGameplay - 10\nOverall appeal - 10\n\nFinal score - 8.8","December 24, 2014","true","48.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The game, 2 months after launch still crashes and has obnoxious camera angles and sway. The performance is still all over the place. The game additionally is flawed, since you can charge and charge ANY enemy over and over and never take hits while doing almost significant damage. Ever. (Shield)\n\n*EVER*\n\nThis is a dumbed down, buggy unpolished sloppy attempt at recreating a souls esque game. It is not a challenge for a souls player (beat ALL bosses first try, if it didn't crash getting there, and like Souls 2 the bosses were pretty repetitive.) The crashing wouldn't be such an issue if it saved in near realtime like souls, but NO. It is checkpoint based. You killed all those enemies and your game crashes? Oh, well do it. Again. And again.

The game was enjoyable for a playthrough but there really isn't much to do (secrets wise / off the beaten path etc) and it's reeeeally slow which i'm not a fan of. Feels like absoloutely no need to do new game plus (since literally nothing changes), so there's almost no replayability to the game. Also, all of the DLC's are complete trash money makers, even the labyrinth that they describe as 'vast' is about the size of a football pitch...(that's also the only content dlc available, the rest are stat boosters and items.....","March 25","false","50.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

For example I found myself killing a boss I was supposivbly meant to leave till later on.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, giving you an idea of some of the things dark souls could have done, the perfect timing system with swings to reward not button mashing, the magic isnt intrusive on combat and isnt a automatic win and enemies are both fun and can be unpredicatble.\n\nThe problems being no enemies are really memorable including bosses, a lot just involve either jus the dodge-hit strategy with little deviation from their 2-3 moves, or out cheaping them, for example on boss who will spam a fire attack you wont be able to dodge really all that well, so you have to spam fire resistance items to really win just in case you get hit once.\n\nThe Rune system is interesting, but could use more work, its really hardly worth your time exept for the gauntlet.\n\nThe characters are really needing work, I came out of dark souls and really felt terrible for some chars, even my enemies fates. In this I really couldnt care less about any of the supporting cast or the main character, there is really nothing worth noting about them, you have: "obvious villain", "The girl" and "The exposition spewer" Thats abut it from a few side quests and one knight who hates you for... some reason?\n\nAltogether, I like the gameplay, the fighting works and how armour and stats really do play into your game, if just for that its worth trying it out.\n\nHowever the lack of good characters, enemies and overall story is a little offputting, I would reccomend you get it on deal if anything as it is still fun, albeit not worth its full price if you are looking for a challenge or a story to lose yourself in.","November 8, 2014","true","17.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It seemed very good to start with, but as I got deeper into the game a number of problems arose. The first was the numerous bugs, with random sounds playing for no reason, fps drops, and even the game crashing rarely, which forced me to do a whole lot of work due to save points instead of auto save every few seconds like other games. In addition to that, there are a slew of other things I take issue with, such as the outright bizzare enemy hitboxes, the ridiculous difficulty it takes to wield a heavy weapon effectively (especially against enemies with shields, they'll get their guard broken and then have it back up before you can actually get a swing in on them), and a number of times I was trapped in a corner by various bosses, causing me to lose the boss fight and start over.\n\nOverall, a very good idea, but I would not recommend this game due to it's poor execution and massive array of bugs. It feels like a very good Beta, but it's not a Beta, it's a full game.","December 25, 2014","false","12.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Souls fans will definitely enjoy this game. While borrowing a good deal from the success of Souls games, Lords of the Fallen has enough to define it as an entirely seperate game.\n\nCombat feels heavier, and much more similar to Dark Souls than Dark Souls 2. What it does different from DaS combat is implement magic as a part of every build. The only character customization is essentially choosing a heavy armor tank build, a medium armor cleric build, and a light armor stealth build. The estus flask idea carries on with health potions, which replenish at checkpoints. Players can increase their potion count by finding empty bottles, hidden in hard to reach locations.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, even better than Dark Souls 2. The lighting provides a dark and intense atmosphere without critically hindering visibility, though players will probably find it difficult to spot traps in the dark indoor chambers.\n\nWhile I won't compare the story to those in the Souls games, the story in Lords of the Fallen is much more direct and is quite good so far. There's a whole tab for discovered lore, for fans who love to delve deeper into a world's history.\n\nAnd finally, the death system has a few tweaks compared to those of the Souls games. Upon death all carried xp is dropped and players are sent back to the last activated checkpoint. Beyond that, no stats or equipment are affected, although players only have a few minutes to reach their death spot to reclaim their xp, and death before retrieval will result in the loss of any dropped points.\n\nI suppose that wasn't really a short review, oops. All in all, while Lords of the Fallen originates and borrows strongly from the Souls franchise, the game successfully sets itsself apart as more than a clone. Though some elements of combat may be more forgiving, Lords of the Fallen is still every bit as challenging and demanding as any of the Souls games.","October 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I was hoping that if I finished the Story it would surprise me but I decided to make the review even before that.\nAnd why? Because this game is not good. Period.

No matter how far you are.\n\nWhat else do I have noticed?\n\nThe game crashes sometimes.\n\n* Do I have anything good about this game?\n\nOnly that the graphics are impressive.

My sympathy goes out to all who were not as lucky as I was. At the time of writing, I have completed the game as a cleric and I'm wrapping up my NG+1 mode as a Warrior. I had to cut a lot of content for this review because of the word limitation Steam puts on it's user reviews.\n\n++Let's start with the good stuff first. While graphics aren't important anymore in this day and age, because every single game looks gorgeous these days, it must be noted that Lords looks absolutely stellar. Even though my system can barely run it, you can clearly see that there is a lot of hard work that went in almost every single area of the game. The game doesn't look as magnificent like in the screenshots though, but don't let that dissuade you: this game looks superb.\n\n++I liked the compactness of the game world. While every single RPG of the last 8 years is trying to be the next World of WarCraft or Skyrim, Lords keeps it neat and tidy. Lords doesn't have many locations, and, logically, every location in the game looks gorgeous and lavish with detail. They all look like real, believable places. There is no silly padding, no unnecessary: "Harkyn! Please kill ten demon hounds and then return here!" questing. There is one main quest, about ten side quests and a neatly compacted game world consisting of a handful of locations for you to do them in. If you're great at the game, you'll just blast past all the content in a matter of a dozen hours and have seen all the locations. But I really like this style of RPG and it's a system I definitely I want to see more of.\n\n++Honorable mentions: Awesome looking armor and weapons. They're a real treat to behold and there's a huge amount of armor and weapons lying around if you look hard enough. The XP system is also a real treat. It allows the unskilled player to grind himself XP, plainly making him more powerful versus other enemies, but since it costs so much to gain a level, I think it maintains a very nice balance, not allowing the player to become overpowered. Above-average soundtrack, very appropriate tunes that don't get boring or samey.\n\n--And now for the bad stuff. My problems with Lords (and the Souls games for that matter) are actually very simple and yet difficult to explain in few sentences. Souls, but especially Lords feel difficult for no good reason. For me, the very core of a game, the single most important aspect, the goal of any video game developer should be the endless quest of making sure your players are having a good time with the it: that they are having FUN. I would truly like to discuss both these games with a mature Dark Souls player and ask him or her to explain to me why he or she loves these kinds of games. I think I'm the only one who doesn't enjoy these games because everybody who hasn't slept under a rock seems to be enjoying this huge 'Souls'-fix. The argument I always hear is that in game worlds this depressing and bleak 'fun' is not something you should be experiencing and I find that to be such bullsh*t. You CAN have bleak virtual worlds and the concept of fun mashed together, guys. Ever played Deus Ex before? Or Bioshock? Or Wolfenstein: The New Order? Or hundreds of other games I'm sure exist with this combination. I do not find dying in a game fun. There are only very few and very specific games that get away with 'dying a lot' for me. Super Meat Boy comes to mind, and that game was magnificently designed. When said game is not created perfectly, dying over and over and over again should never, EVER be the goal of a developer. And yet, both these games have had developers behind them wanted, WISHING you to die over and over again.\n\n--The reason why I claim that Lords and Souls feel difficult for no good reason is because when you look at these games they just seem like regular third-person hack 'n slashers where your character feels like he weighs a billion tons and moves ridiculously slow. Your adversaries can move much faster than you do and when they hit you it eats 75% (figuratively of course) of your lifebar away. The enemies themselves, however, take many, MANY hits to go down. Most have a shield that can block any attack coming from you, and the weaknesses they show go away in an instant, only giving you time to get in one attack if you're lucky. Surviving some encounters often feel like strokes of luck rather than skill. Both games often feel like the developers made these games and just tweaked the sliders for health bars and damage outputs. I've had enemies in the early hours of both games stunlock me to death over and over again, resulting in screaming frustration, something I haven't experienced in over a decade in a video game and yet, it's only games like these that bring so much depressing anger for a product that should be designed as fun.\n\n--Even when you get used to the combat, there are moments where you feel the game itself is actually taunting you. There are fat demons who are hunters in Lords who usually have a wild dog with them. When you try to hit the dog, it understandably usually dodges your very slow attacks. The hunter demon simply jumps backwards like a nimble ballerina and attacks you again. It defies all logic that so many enemies in Lords can dodge attacks that should not be dodged, predictably leaving you with more loss of health and an even bigger loss of stamina, until you finally push him in a corner and finally kill him.\n\n--When I say that the combat is slow, so is the magic. It would be quicker to educate me in magic in real-life than Harkyn doing his spell in the game, I'm not kidding. Magic, which usually plays a supportive role in Lords, is often essential for certain situations, providing you with a protective shield for especially hard-hitting enemies or a spell that stuns lighter, simpler enemies when they attack you. And when you are in dire need of a spell in the game, then you can kiss you sweet experience goodbye because you are going to LOSE. Not because of the mana requirement, not because of the decades of game time it needs to be cast, but because it's the kind of magic that cannot be interrupted. One hit, and it's canceled out, often leading to your demise, as usual. You almost have to know the placement of the enemies in advance BEFORE you cast your spell.\n\n--The 'bankable XP system' that people seem to be praising so much isn't that amazing or exceptional. Considering the amount of crashing this game does for most people, and how ridiculously easy it is to die in this game, I actually see no point to hold on to the XP you are carrying. The interests of the multiplier aren't that huge, and when you are early in the game you desperately need all the XP you can get. When the time comes you can hold your own in this game to let that multiplier go up, you already have all the tools you need to win the game anyway so the bankable XP system is rendered completely null and void in the end.\n\n--Extremely long loading times and frequent FPS drops.\n\nClosing thoughts on Lords of the Fallen: Lords of the Fallen is a game that is too hard for its own good, and would've been a million times better if it focused more on story aspects rather than trying the be Dark Souls: Viking Edition. I have completed it almost twice, but I know after uninstalling it, I'll probably never play it again. The reason I completed it twice was because for what little good the game did, it does it exceptionally well: I was nuts about the aesthetics of the game, the very idea of a Space Marineish character battling hordes of demonic creatures sent by God to annihilate the world in a snow-buried castle, and you are all that's standing in their way. I will be interested in seeing a sequel for the game that fixes my issues with it. Only buy it when it'is very cheap in a sale.\n\n\nMy specs:\nWindows 7 64-bit\nIntel Core i7 920 2.67GHz\n6GB RAM\nMSI 660Ti OC Power Edition","January 3, 2015","false","31.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazalad/recommended/265300/","hazalad","Wolverine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazalad/","83 products in account",""Three crashes in 5 minutes."\n\nThat was my initial review, which was my first one and written in pure frustration due to all the bugs plaguing that game.I will do my best to explain in more details why I would still not recommend this game yet.\n\nFirst of all, I played only the first Dark Souls and I enjoyed it as much as I hated it at the same time. Some of my main issues with Souls was the lack of convenient checkpoint before boss fights - because I am not that hardcore and would like all the help I could get, I would try to summon NPC to help me fight the bosses. Well, I can not remember how much time I got invaded in front of the Dragon Knights duo chamber. The checkpoints are much mroe convenient in Lords - and I can not really think of something done better in that game.\n\nThe combat feels heavy and clunky - especially when using greatswords/axes. You need so much time to wind up the attack that unless you time it perfectly, you will get staggered by the lightning-fast enemy attack. And you can barely time it properly because of that - the lightning fast enemy attacks. They might be all in heavy armor and with greatshields, but they are attacking so freaking fast and breaking your guard so easy in the begining it is not even funny - nor fair. And you can not break their guard untill late game - it is just not possible. This makes the fight vs some of the shield weilders true nightmare, especially in early game. Even when you learn how to do it, it is still a chore and too time-consuming to be fun. Now I understand they are super-strong demons from other dimension, but for the sake of freaking gameplay - at least make it so we are able to freaking break their guard.\n\nAlso on the fighting - how can you possibly dual-weild one handed weapon SLOWER and when using it with one hand and shield? Check The Avenger (I think that was the name of the sword), this is ridiculous. Two-hand weilding does not give you speed most of the time, just leaves you more open to attacks. Also - all greatswords have exact the same identical moves - all the greataxes and hammers as well. Actually, most of the weapons are just a reskin with identical move sets. The game suffers heavily from lack of diversity in that department - they should learn from the Souls.\n\nAgility weapons, and daggers in particular, feel very bad. They have nice very high damaging combos, but the last part of the combo is usually (with the case of daggers) charging move... which very often miss due ot enemies just slightly moving aside; or you just move past them by your own. Enemies however dont have that problem - if you dodge to the side, they auto-correct their aim and positioning mid-swing and will still hit you. That feels too unfair and cheap, considering they are as already mentioned with unbreakable guard and lightning-fast attacks.\n\nThe magical system is there just for the sake of having some magic in the game - I played Paladin on my first playthrough and most of the time when I tried to cast anything I would get staggered by the creeps or bosses - because of the abyssmal long casting time, in which your hero stays in one place and makes fancy moves. I would appreaciate if some kind of mobility was invilved like in Souls, where you can still move while casting, but slower. It is ridiculous and not fun at all.\n\nThe main thing that put me aside from the game and I will not most probably play it anymore is the loot system. Where is the replayability if in your first playthrough you open all the chests and get all the gear?! What if I got some crappy normal version of a very cool sword, and I want to socket it? Forget it - if you want another better vesrion of the sword, you need to know the exact chest and you need to start a new game and to make sure you have good multiplier for higher rarity chance. It would be much more helpful to be able to upgrade the common variation to higher rarity by crafting - or at least have everything drop again on New Game+ and ++ but with higher chance for better rarity.\n\nOn a side note, I wanted to play agi char. Well, almost midgame and still the best agi-weapon was the one I foung in the very first 30 mins after start. I just gave up at that point.\n\nAt this point I do not see any reason to play that game again. I was fooled by the pre-release streaming and the nice setting, but I would have never payed £30 for that garbage. The game is too small, too repetitive, too buggy and definetely not worth the price tag.\n\nAlso keep in mind I have not played after the last patches and although some system issues might have been resolved, I will still not play it because of the all things mentioned above. All of the above is my personal opinion base don my personal experience with this trash, I mean the game, and might differ from yours. I would actually recommend the game after few patches and on a sale for at least 60% off, but not for full price. Do NOT get it for full price, do not make the same mistake as me.\n\nIf you really bothered to read that - thanks and game on.","November 3, 2014","false","23.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It is a lot beginner friendly and easier, but it isn't too easy and shares the many traits of instakills if you just run like a fool into battle.\n\nThe fighting feels solid and each swing and block feels heavy and strong. Even the moving is up to par with other games of the genre, it is solid and responding. The more heavier armours and weapons you wear, the slower you get and become a walking statue - whiles the lighter gear makes you swift and quick to strike your demon foes.\n\nWhile the story is something generic in european fashion, along with the voice acting - it is still enough unique and interesting to stand out with it's multiple endings and choices along the way to enrichen the world. Lores are scattered through the worlds as "audio scroll" for not wasting your time and this is quite a positive thing for me - the game is telling the lore to you, not making you speculate everything you find and see.\n\nBut, with all games, there are some flaws. Many of the game breaking bugs has been fixed by now, but there are some minor bugs still that are just mostly amusing than anything braking. Sometimes the bodies of your fallen enemies flies up to the sky, only to be juggled ontop of your head. Sometimes the player spings rapidly around after doing a killing blow while locked on the enemy. Some minor sound bugs(hard to pin point out) and shadow glitches.\n\nIn the end, I heartly would recommend this game to any one who enjoyes action-rpg games, especially the more ruthless ones.","November 6, 2014","true","18.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I'd heard from youtuber Totalbiscuit that this game was horrendously optimized for PC. As it turned out he was right, i vastly exceed the recommended specs for the game (nvidia geforce 770 and 16 gigs of ram to give you an idea) But the game still had horrendous framerate, to the point that it almost froze. I ran a test with fraps to see the numbers, and it was consistently at 30 or dropped below that.\n\nNow, the game itself is very Dark Soul reminiscent, (Both of them being bad PC ports) And handles very much alike it. You control Harkyn, the main protagonist of the game) From a 3rd person perspective. You've got several different playstyles much alike that of the Soul games. But what i found in this game was that there was no way you were ever going to enjoy the game playing your own way.\n\nI started out as a Rogue, because ive always enjoyed sneakily shanking enemies when their backs are turned, and quickly found my ♥♥♥♥ on a plate because there had been no proper explanation of a stealth system, or if one such system even existed.\n\nAnd then, right after the tutorial fight with the first Rhogar, i had my first crash.\n\nI was ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I looked at the forum to see if this was a common issue, and indeed this was something that has happened to a lot of people. I then also saw that the forums were infected with the very worst part of both the PC gaming community and the Dark Souls community. So entitled ♥♥♥♥♥♥s saying that anyone who does not own a pc powered by the souls of dead children should have no business playing PC games, and also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who ramble about you being a noob if you can't find this one single item burried away in a cave somewhere near a cove behind two secret walls, a fire, and a monster the size of the moon.\n\nSo i returned, my problem unsolved, when as soon as the Nvidia logo had vanished the game crashed again.\n\nSo after i'd gotten myself something to drink, and beat my head against the wall for a few minutes, I booted up the game again and it actually launched. To then find that my save file was gone.\n\n\nGrumbling and determined not to let this ♥♥♥♥ing game beat me, i started a new file and created myself a Cleric Brawler, cause i decided that if the game was gonna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then so was i. And suddenly the game was an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing cakewalk, i died two times at the first boss and then he was trashed aswell, Despite this i did find myself cursing at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t momentum cancelling attacks from enemies. This continued until i reached the third boss.\n\nThis was where i officially clicked quit game and deleted the damn thing from my PC. ♥♥♥♥ you Lords of the Fallen. Being hard is one thing, but be hard and fair at the same time. A boss that spawns minions that stun lock you and then proceeds to beat you senseless isnt fair, its trying to beat a wall down with your forehead.\n\nSo in short, can't recommend, maybe try Dark Souls 2 in stead.","December 31, 2014","false","4.4"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","2"

I enjoy some of its design decisions but it's incredibly short (with DLC it took me under 9 hours), and I can only ascribe so much of that to my experience with similar titles. However, it has actual useful kb/m controls, and is a solidly programmed title on this platform, so that's a huge plus over the aforementioned's PC edition.\n\nI'm incredibly fond of its risk/reward mechanic: the longer you go without laying down a save/dying, the higher your XP multiplier becomes. XP functions as currency and level-fodder, but can be gained also via exploration, sidequests (yes! those exist in this!), and a "checkpoint" system which lets you choose a new respawn point/effectively quicksave, without resetting the multiplier. The multiplier only applies to combat-given XP, but that makes perfect sense, and it's not like that doesn't make boss encounters more tense as you try to take them out in one so you can turn them from one level up into four.\n\nOther positives: bosses all have a specific kill condition to upgrade their drops (which is hinted at in some of the lore or notes) for further risk/reward and playstyle changes, you get a shotgun (or just projectile weapon, but I liked using it as a shotgun) which can be used offensively or defensively if you want to make that your build, and the various spell schools allow for some drastically different play, if you want straight offense, healing, or a more subterfuge-based style. I'm all over this and I hope some of its systems get lifted for future titles, because apparently lately I only play evolutionary dead-end titles.","November 17, 2015","true","9.0"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

At first I was put off by the Diablo/Warhammer-esque artstyle, but I totally came around on it. The beautiful look of the game is one of its biggest assets (especially after the graphical disappointment of another, similar game. Ahem.)\n\nThe gameplay is of course inspired by Dark Souls, but it actually introduces some fresh new ideas like timing-based combos, overcharging attacks and a fun upgrade mechanic where you bet experience to receive better runes.\n\nIt's a neat package. Every part and system of the game is a bit smaller than its inspiration, owed to a small development team and tighter budget. But it is a prime example of making the most of limited resources.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lt_Mav3rick/recommended/265300/","Lt_Mav3rick","Lt_Maverick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lt_Mav3rick/","257 products in account","I do recommend this game. As of 1/2/2015, game is "playable." I do understand that the devs recommend 4gb of vram and specify that double gfx cards with 2 Gb of vram do not equate to 4 Gb (SLI). However, my gtx 680s in sli have handled everything thrown at them thus far including some games that require a higher VRAM. That said, when I switched to CPU controlled physx, the game handled better (I realized after this game that Black Flag runs infinitely greater with this option as well). That said, this game is still choppy at some points. I haven't experienced the crash to desktop others have attested to but I do feel as though these stutters occur at inopportune moments. I have read that the DRM is a resource hog. I have never hacked a game but others have said that the hacked version is better because it doesn't hog resources. This is a major problem for me because I feel penalized for paying for the game. I am going to continue playing the game and I want to beat the game because I like the look, the lore, and the gameplay. I have heard people compare this game to the Dark Souls franchise. I just purchased DS2 and have yet to download. I'll download it after I am finished with this. I did play the DS1 port for PC and only played for 30 minutes. I simply found the graphics insurmountable. I've heard there are mods for it increase texture res and I can't recall if I installed them or not, I think I did before I even played the game, but I just could not get passed how horrific the game looked when I played it. Maybe in the future I'll revisit it.\n\nAs far as this game is concerned, I like the combat. I have run into some glitches with bosses that can be exploited (I cut a bosses life in half and almost defeated him but got slaughtered before potion consumption) but they provide a decent challenge. I've died a ton of times but I do not feel useless or hopeless. Another thing I've noticed is that if you save at a certain point you have to fight all of the people you've encountered until that point. This is meant to increase difficulty but fortunately you gain XP for it. I like this aspect because if you face a boss that seems too difficult you can go backwards, gain XP, and increase your attributes.\n\nOne thing I strongly advise against, that I also noticed on PC Gamer's review, is using the rogue. Agility in a cramped corridor is useless and much of this game takes place in said environment. I found it discouraging initially so I deleted my save, and restarted as the warrior class. I've been much more successful with this class. One thing that definitely could use some patching, aside from the horsecrap DRM, is the target selection. When using the right joystick, you have to quickly tap the direction you want to change to. In the heat of battle this is very annoying and it does not have a wide FOV, while on paper this sounds good and challenging, when playing with a warrior class character this is annoying as your character is already clunky enough. There should be an option or the devs should just retroacctively change the setting completely.\n\nPros: Beautiful graphics when running smoothly. I consider myself a graphics freak. Though I haven't played LOR: Shadows of Mordor, this game is one of the best looking games in the genre as far as its use of nVidia Turbulence and other graphics features. I like the setting and the shine on your character. The character looks completely B.A. in my opinion.\n\nOther than the target selection the combat is very fun and challenging in this game. There is a pattern to every boss and every boss requires some thought prior to engagement.\n\nThe music is very fitting for an epic game with bagpipes and a choir.\n\nThe attribute system is very plain and simple but each decision is evident in combat thus far.\n\nA major plus is that you are not forced to discard inventory. Some people like Dragon Age style inventory, I can't stand inventory management. I understand the realism of it, but I hate the time that it takes to manage it. There is nothing worse than having an objective in a game but travelling back to your home base/chest to dump off inventory.\n\nCons: The resource hogging DRM. I know my GPUs aren't the latest and greatest but some of the newer high end cards are only 10-15% stronger than my GPU (GTX 680). There is no reason why I can run other games that require more resources but this game I get fps dips because of DRM. I've read that the DRM even taxes the GPUs. I haven't read the technical aspects of this but it's annoying. I'm hoping the devs patch it so I can play the game again with a different class/build with better graphics.\n\nThe target selection/acquisition is extremly clunky and definitely needs some patching this gets annoying when fighting a boss and its minions converge on you and you can't quick change your target.\n\nLip syncing. The lip syncing in the game is horrific. This is probably the worst lip syncing I've witnissed in a long time. I know games aren't as good as live action films but when you play this, you'll notice what I speak of.\n\nConclusion: This game definitely has some glaring flaws. However, at its core it's a great game with solid gameplay. I know it's received bad reviews on some popular review sites but I recommend this game. If the devs can polish the game it can become ven better; I hope they continue working on this game.","January 2, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has not crashed once on me. The 1.4 patch did wonders, I guess. Otherwise, I found the game to be quite entertaining. It has a small world, yes, but it's filled to the tip, and you'll be backtracking a lot, since some areas open only later in the game. The design is kind of power fantasy, you look like a spiky tank most of the time, and the enemies are grotesque. The combat is clunky, albeit realistic. It focuses on tactical blocking, evading and timing of your hits, and the heavy weapons WILL feel heavy (some of them need two hands to be used, regardless of your strength). It kinda forces you to use all the tools at your disposal, which is a good thing, since it varies the gameplay and forces you to think up strategies on the go. The main story is meh, but you are a criminal and you can totally mess up humanity if you chose one of the three possible endings, so in the end it's fine by my standards.","January 2, 2015","true","42.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morrae/recommended/265300/","morrae","morrae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morrae/","1156 products in account","I was interested in this game since release and finally picked it up during christmas sale of 2014. Dark Souls is one of my all time favorites, so I was ready to ignore negative steam reviews and form my own opinion. The game is highly recommended to every Souls games fan. It is also a nice introduction to these types of games, so if you really wanted to try Souls but wasn't sure it's for you, I'd recommend this game. It's somewhat easier and more friendly, so beginners will have good time playing it.\nFirst of all, it is a sure clon of Souls series games and I can't escape comparing it to them. Combat mechanics is absolutely the same, leveling up and saving is almost the same, the spirit of the Souls is here. But with a nice twists here and there. It is surely more a western game, then japanese for starters. The art and graphics are absolutely gorgeous, UI is fantastic and easy to use (which cannot be said about Souls), every mechanic is nicely explained and you don't need to read dozens of guides just to be able to do basic things. But it doesn't mean the game has no secrets, no. Like every Souls game you will miss a lot on your first playthrough, but that's okay.\nThe things I would've liked to be improved in Lords Of The Fallen:\n- Content and length of the game. I finished it in 16 hours and that's counting some grinding. Locations lack variety, there are disappointing number of bosses and there's no "wow" effect like it was in Dark Souls. I hope next installment brings more epic fights in a bizzare locations\n- More class variety and leveling up options\n- More interesting and engaging NPCs. There were some, but nothing to write home about. The only interesting one I think was some dude you had to bring human skulls to\n- No multiplayer options. May be it was too difficult to achieve, but it would've been nice to at least place some clues for other people.\n\nAnd that's basicly it. Technical side wise the game run nice for me. It crashed only one time and there were couple wierd sound glitches, but nothing too bad or gamebreaking. Developers did nice job patching and I didn't encounter too much problems. Of course they should've shiped more polished game, but they didn't abandoned it, so it's all good.\nWhat I did like about Lords Of The Fallen:\n- Magic is more of an addition to the main combat then focus of it. I liked how easy it was to use and how uncomplicated the system was. It's more of a support style magic and I thought it worked great with this type of game\n- Design of the world, design of the weapons and armors. Absolutely fantastic. Every time I've put new set on myself, I couldn't believe it can look more bad ♥♥♥, but then I've picked another one and once again was amazed. Just stellar job for designers. Great weapons, ugly enemies, great UI and overall vision. A+++\n- Sound design. Music is awesome and right on the money, great ambient sound. Enemies make terrifying sounds. Great!\n- Although it's a secret, but you can completely respec into a differenet class during a game. Liked that a lot\n- Story is good. Not super great, but decent. And little pieces of it in form of audio logs were interesting\n- Different endings depending on what you did during a game, nice little addition\n- New game + of course\n- Challenges during boss fights were super nice addition\n- Level design with shortcuts that wraps around itself\n\nIn the end, I would say that I enjoyed this game very much. In current state it has no technical problems any more and it's very fun. It's not as hard as Souls game, so a lot more people can enjoy it. I would purchase any future projects from this studio.","December 29, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just like any other on release date it had some issues , few crashes and few frame drops there and there, but overall it is a very good game. I personaly expierenced only 3 crashes in over 19 hours of gameplay, posibly because i played it all maxed out @1920-1080 with a single gtx 970 not even overclocked. I had a stable 60 fps most of the time.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics. not to bash the Dark Souls 2 but man, this game just blows it out of the water, it's really something to look at.Very responsive controls, combat feels fluent. it's always a challange even if you facelower lvl monsters from earlier areas, so you gotta keep your guard up.\n\nCons:\nAs i have mention above, i have had a few crashes and few frame drops there and there. Other than that game worked solid.\n\nPossible improvements? i would very much like to have a map in this game, for that matter in any rpg game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mantorsio/recommended/265300/","Mantorsio","Kinch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mantorsio/","281 products in account",""Lords of the Fallen" takes a handful of mechanics from games such as Demon Souls and Dark Souls, which means the game's unforgiving until you get used to the basics, you will die often, and you play as a sword-and-board dude who runs circles (lol).\n\nApart from running around the place (there's quite some backtracking), what you will be doing most of the time is combat, and - depending on your class - fighting can and will feel slow. I picked a warrior and found that many of the attacks were painfully sluggish. Eventually, I finished the game with a light 100% block shield and a one-hander, which feels... pretty standard for a fantasy game like this.\n\nIf you don't want to play a warrior, you can also pick a dual-wielding rogue, or a cleric who can use staves. On top of this, all classes get a gauntlet weapon you can use to cast spells.\n\nThe game feels very much eclectic. Core mechanics come from Dark Souls. The visuals are very much inspired by Diablo and World of Warcraft (weapon and armour design), but also by Darksiders (armour, puzzles, treasure chests, spell animations).\n\nThe setting is very generic and I think it's LotF biggest problem - it just doesn't feel unique in any way. Even the story is bland and merely serves as a means of getting you from point A to point B in a pretty linear fashion.\n\nThe game also has some technical problems and the devs are not too eager to fix them.\n"Lords of the Fallen.exe" is a quite common issue that might annoy you more than dying over and over again (when you crash, you lose your progress).\nMobs, and sometimes even bosses, can glitch out making them easier or harder to kill.\n\nTo sum it up:If you liked Dark Souls give this game a shot when it's on sale.\nIf you hated DS or this type of games is just not your thing, play something else. You won't like this one either.","December 26, 2014","true","27.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really just... The game has potential. It does. When the game works well it's pretty fun, and there are some neat mechanics in the game. But it just isn't put together all that well. After one play through nothing really changes and I found myself speeding through content just because I didn't want to listen to it again.\n\nThen there's the added problems of glitches, leveling, and really odd difficulty spikes.\n\nThe glitches are said to be improved from where they were originally. I played that game in patch 1.4 and it's still buggy as all get out. At one point the final boss walked through a wall, got stuck. I hit him a couple of times, he telleported, moonwalked for a little bit, and then insta-killed me with lord knows what. That's just one glitch there's plenty more to choose from.\n\nThe leveling system in this game is completely broken past the first play through. Once I got to about level 80 I stopped really being able to level through gathering experience. I had to go through all the secrets I already found to pick up attribute shards in order to level up because the experience needed was so high. By the end of my third play through to get one level I would have needed 1.5 million experience off of enemies that give about 2 throusand experience with a full multiplier. That's pretty crazy. I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the last problem.\n\nDifficulty in this game makes no sense. It isn't a hard game, not even close. It's that some enemies are much much stronger than others and it doesn't always make sense. In NG+ and NG++ some of the most annoying enemies for my agility build were the zombies. The trash mobs that are everywhere. Nasty looking guy with a giant shield, no problem. Stupid puss zombie that can't even swing a sword well. Ya that thing will take three times as many hits to take down. Granted it has to do with my using the agility staff with three runes for most of the game and it being mostly poison damage, but even when I switched weapons those things were damage sponges. Then there's the bosses. In NG++ I was to the point where the second to last boss couldn't take off more than 5% of my health bar in an attack. I easily tanked through that fight and all the others. Then I got to the last boss and he damn near one shotted me. It didn't matter what armor I put on he still did it. And by then I couldn't do things like change my build to try different tactics. I was stuck trying to beat this guy when he would kill me that easily. It just felt unfair. Not even challenging, just unfair.\n\nThere are positives though. The game is pretty. Well not pretty so much as the graphics are nice on higher settings. And the combat, when it works correctly, is pretty fun. The positives just aren't that great though.\n\nIt's tempting to compare the game to Dark Souls, but it's really nothing like that game. This one is more like a game that started out that way and some one just get saying to extreme it up. There's armor in the game? Give him huge pointy shoulder pads with a fist on his chest! There's daggers in the game? Make some that have extra pointy bits and detailing all over the place. Put skulls on shields, put tatoos on the guy's face, put a giant hand in the background! EXTREME!\n\nMy first playthrough was fun, and if that's all you want go for it when it's on sale. If you're like me and you want to get all the stuff you might want to look else where. With the above mentioned stuff the experience is frustrating. Not difficult, not at all, just frustrating.","January 1, 2015","false","41.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That being said, there is no excuse for games these days especially non-indie titles, to be released as beta feeling as this game was. Unforunately that seems to be just par for the course these days in the industry and I won't let my personal feelings on that matter apply here.\n\nThis game is a third person action rpg that uses a similar control set-up to the dark souls games and leveling system, but that is where the similarities really end. You do gain and lose your experience by killing/dying and must go to where you died to retrieve your exp. This exp does start to disappear overtime though, and you're not likely to retrieve most of your exp if you're very far from a checkpoint.\n\nThe game's difficulty is not high, and most of the struggles you'll face are at the beginning, and very end of the game. The mid-game seems unbalanced and you will be mowing through most enemies.\n\nThe combat is much faster paced than the Souls games and I'd say it's about a mid-ground between that and Darksiders 2's combat. They did an excellent job of making each weapon type feel differently and I feel the physics here surpass the Souls series by far. The staff weapons were incredibly overpowered during the time I played the game due to it's fast attack speed and good scaling damage. This could always be fixed in balance patches or mods however.\n\nThe bosses were fairly underwhelming, but there are a good variety of enemy types which take different tactics in order to combat as opposed to the souls series (lock on and circle) method of killing just about everything which detracts from my enjoyment of that particular franchise. There were multiple ways to defeat a few of the bosses, and this allowed you to receieve special equipment upon killing them which I thought was a rather neat addition. Some of the weaker and early bosses become elite enemies that you will fight throughout the game as well, forcing you to adapt your combat style when fighting them as well as a group of lesser enemies at the same time.\n\nThere are many collectibles in the game, and while the lore is pretty generic, it's still interesting enough to warrant collecting all the scrolls and finding the secret equipment (which there is a good number of).\n\nThe games length was decent, and it could probably be played through 2-3 times in order to play different styles, and colelct the new game + gear, however, new game+ difficulty does not scale nearly fast enough in order for it to be a challenge.\n\nAs a final note, I do recommend the game, and while it's not anywhere near perfect, there are some innovative ideas here, and I'd like to see a sequel one day improve on what worked, and change what didn't. This is definitely the best game this particular studio has made to date, and I think they should be supported for adding some creativity to this genre which is pretty much dominated by a single franchise at this point.","December 31, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicBytch/recommended/265300/","EpicBytch","Feed The Meat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicBytch/","128 products in account","I have to say this games has its pros and cons just like any other game but I'll just say what I've noticed and you can decide for yourself if you want to try it or not. As a whole, I recommend it if you can get passed the things that drag it down a bit, I personally am satisfied with my purchase but I'm not jumping for joy over the game because I expected a bit more out of it.\n\nSome things I do like very much is that it has a good solid gameplay to it. The blocking in the game feels like actual blocking where you take no damage (if your energy is high enough to block the incoming attack). The weapon attacks are on the realistic side of the line as well; the heavier the weapon, the slower it swings. Even the dodging feels more realistic which could be good for some gamers and bad for others because you may end up dodging and still getting hit (e.g. the enemy swings at waist height and you dodge, the weapon might still hit you because it was low enough).\n\nThe targeting can go both ways in this game, in can be a plus in some cases and a detriment in others, you'll have to decide what you like or dislike about it. The targetting locks on to your enemy of choice and you can swap enemies with a quick tap of your camera controls (Right analog if you use a gamepad) in either direction. The problems I have found with it though is there is no quick way to switch targets if one runs behind you (Which they do as a combat technique). Another issue I have found with it is that you can't target unless you have near full view of the enemy which makes it harder on you when coming through a narrow corridor and, unfortunately, there are invisible objects that can get in your way as well (e.g. I found one enemy standing beside a fire brazier and I couldn't target him even though I could clearly see him).\n\n"Energy" is basically stamina. It is consumed by attacks (Both regular and power attacks though power attacks take more, obviously), blocking, dodging, as well as sprinting. Your energy recharges on its own at a decent rate, just back up out of range of the bad guy's attacks for a few seconds and your energy will fill up quickly. Your energy will still feel up if you are blocking but it will fill up much slower which means you can't just tank all the hits easily, you actually have to employ tactics to get your energy up while still taking as little damage as possible. I've noticed that bosses will have attacks to completely drain your energy (The first two will slap you with their shields to drain your energy to 0).\n\nThe magic of the game can obviously play a good part in the game, I can't say I have gotten very far into the game (About 2 hours of gameplay) but I haven't found a need or even desire to use the magic in the game. The magic really isn't anything fantastic. You can heal yourself somewhat, raise your defence, increase attack, do a magic power attack, make a clone of yourself to distract the enemy, but nothing really all that great. You have three "classes" of magic, each has their own benefits.\n\nVisually it is fairly good. I can't say it has the best graphics in the world but it definitely has high quality. I'm a bit of a graphics snob and this game is good enough for me visually. I do have to say, the character models are lacking in their mesh morphs because the lip sync with the words is extremely off; laughably so. The characters move their mouths in much the same way as a ventriloquist's puppets do, basically just a jaw flapping down and back up, and they don't move in a way that really goes with the words, they just seem to move at random and half of the spoken words in the game don't have lip movements at all.\n\nThe lack of character appearance customization may not appeal to everyone or even might make people completely refuse to play the game. I believe that the lack of character customization is simply because you are playing an existing character in this alternate reality instead of creating one. Unfortunately, there are no appearance choices at all. You don't choose hairstyles, genders, etc. You simply play the guy you see in the trailer with markings all over his face. If that doesn't bother you, then pay no heed to this paragraph (I am not bashing lack of character appearance customization, I don't mind either way depending on the game).\n\nThe movement in the game is rather slow. You run slow, you sprint slow, you dodge slow, you attack slow. Even if you choose the light armor with dual daggers, you still dodge slow. The character is hulking and reminiscent of a golem with his movements. I can honestly say that I went with the daggers first but with the poor movement speed and little to no blocking that you would expect from a lightly armored and quick on their feet character, it was much harder than medium or heavy builds. I honestly didn't see any speed increase with the light build over the heavy build.\n\nYou carry your exp around with you on your character and the more you carry the more you get from killing things. You don't get this reward with no risk, of course. You can't level anything up without spending the experience you have and if you die then all of the experience you have with you drops and you have to run back to where you were to get it. Over time, the experience amount will disipate until there is nothing left to recover. In essence, you gamble the experience you have so that you can earn more; the more you risk, the more you earn.\n\nAll in all, I'm pleased with the game though the cons of the game do bother me a bit. I will consider this an overall positive yet neutral review and I hope it was informative rather than biased.\n\nHere is the biased part:\n\nPros:\n-Good blocking\n-Good weapon weight/speed ratio\n-Good graphics\n-Simple tutorial\n-Great energy recharge rate\n\nCons:\n-Poor lip sync with dialog\n-Invisible walls preventing targeting\n-Targetting can prevent you from quickly turning to block an attack from behind\n-Magic system doesn't seem to be worth the effort\n-No character customization\n-Slow movement even when lightly armored","November 6, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really just... The game has potential. It does. When the game works well it's pretty fun, and there are some neat mechanics in the game. But it just isn't put together all that well. After one play through nothing really changes and I found myself speeding through content just because I didn't want to listen to it again.\n\nThen there's the added problems of glitches, leveling, and really odd difficulty spikes.\n\nThe glitches are said to be improved from where they were originally. I played that game in patch 1.4 and it's still buggy as all get out. At one point the final boss walked through a wall, got stuck. I hit him a couple of times, he telleported, moonwalked for a little bit, and then insta-killed me with lord knows what. That's just one glitch there's plenty more to choose from.\n\nThe leveling system in this game is completely broken past the first play through. Once I got to about level 80 I stopped really being able to level through gathering experience. I had to go through all the secrets I already found to pick up attribute shards in order to level up because the experience needed was so high. By the end of my third play through to get one level I would have needed 1.5 million experience off of enemies that give about 2 throusand experience with a full multiplier. That's pretty crazy.

Overall, I would give a 6.5 out of 10 for this game.\n\nIf you have never played a similar genre before (like Dark Souls) , I recommend you pick this game up, as the first time  into such this game genre is definitely mindblowing; besides this game theoretically is 'lighter' than dark souls hence should be more 'friendly' to new player. This is generally true from my own experience.\n\nHowever if you are a veteran from the Souls series, don't expect too much from it. The reasons are listed below:\n\n0. combat-mechanics: the combat mechanics in this game genre is always entertaining. The credit however should go to the original Souls series.\n\n1. Story-wise:  the plot of lords of the fallen is really lousy. Actually I prefer to say there is no story at all. The hero is a rather stale character. The final cutscene is lousy as well.\n\n2. Mobs: only a handful type of mobs exist int the game . Some of the mobs has disgusting mechanics that makes  fighting with them feels more like chore than fun. Besides, most of the mobs are humanoids (Roghars) that lacks the disctinct feel as the enemies in dark souls. Another thing is, I think the designers have overly exploited some of the game mechanics, such as defense with a shield. In this game, there are simply too many mobs bearing shield playing turtle with you from start to the end.\n\n3. Boss fight:  The difficulty of Boss fight is not much challenging for a venteran. but may prove a bit challenging for a newbie. Genreally the design of the bosses is ok, but but Some bosses have really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, including: many bosses bears shield, and too many of them summon minions during the fight, including the final boss. As said before, when these things are overly exploited by the developers, the boss fight does not feel distinct and some times feels annoying.\n\n4. Map and level design: All the stages feels similar and everywhere looks the same color. And you really can get lost in those convoluted tunnels, especially in the 3rd scene. Yes you can argue that throughout the game Harkyn actually fight with a rather limited area,  but it doesn't justify the lack of creativily in level design of this game. This level of similarity makes the player extremely hard to find his/her way and sometimes get frustrated, it is good that the developers everntually release the maps online for free. But then it lost the whole point of the distinctive feature of this game genre: gaming without a map.  As it for the treasure chests, the mechanics is not that attractive as well: many chests are locked and requires a key to open when you initially find them, and sometimes the key has to be dropped randomly from the mobs you kill. Most of the time, by the time you got the key, you either already forgot where the orignal chest was or you are too annoyed to bother going back fighting through all the respawning mobs for a chest that may yield some crap.\n\n5. Graphics: the engine they pick make the graphic looks good, but you have to have a relatively high-spec PC I'm afraid. In my case, I am playing on a middle-end gaming laptop I picked up mid-year 2013, which has 8G RAM and nVidia GT650M (2G graphic mem).  I can hardly play this game on 1600x900 resolution with a reasonable framerate. And We all know a good game is not always about graphics.\n\n6. Bugs:  there are a lot of bugs ever since this game is released. Many of those are game-breaking. It's good that the developers tried to fix some of these by releasing patches, however, it is really unfortunate that up until now,  which is literally the start of a new year (Jan 2nd 2015), some of the game-breaking glitches are still left hanging around. For example, a glitched trinket may cause your mana become a negative value and never regenerate.\n\nGenerally speaking, Lords of the fallen a moderate piece of work, not too shabby, and not that fascinating. You can kill 30 hrs with it.","January 1, 2015","true","34.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I played this game a lot, don't know why. Maybe because fighting isn't clunky and frustrating as ♥♥♥♥ compared to Souls. Your choices just change the ending cinematic and gives you achievements (yay achievements!), and some of your choices can actually ♥♥♥♥ you (not cutting the dude's arm and helping him with potion will not let you get super potions near the end of the game). New Game + Is like Souls except we don't get new monsters, but we do get new lore (the lore is infinitely better than the game's main story). Also, not ALL monsters will get strong with the NG+ so you will get very confused most of the time, and will get one-shot without realzing. Warrior is easy as ♥♥♥♥, if you play this game as warrior you will have the worst experience, unless you don't upgrade your Faith for the absurd spells. Rogue gives the best experience, even though the i-frames are a joke. Cleric is fun as heck. You will have the worst time ever at the final battle, if you went full faith without using the gauntlet.\n\nOverall 7.5/10.\nI enjoyed the game a lot, more than Souls, honestly, but Souls is much better polished (except for the ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating combat mechanics).","November 4, 2014","true","72.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only downside is the forgettable story and characters, but those are of little importance when the combat is weighty, precise, and rewarding. And being a single player game, you can't rely on that online co-operative crutch that can make Dark Souls boss fights incredibly trivial.\n\nMaybe a little too expensive to recommend at full price, but before you just pass it off as a Dark Souls rip-off, I implore you to give it a proper look.

After I heared about this game, i was quit hyped and decided to give this game a go. I am german, but i try to write this review in english. If you find mistakes you are free to keep them ;)\n\n\nGraphic\n\nThis games lookes really good. The armor and weapons look really cool. The enemys and enviroments are designed well and this game sets you up for its dark and grim world. But this game has a huge downside. This game runs really bad on most of the systems. I had to set all settings to medium, but can run Battlefield 4 on Ultra without problems.\n\n\nSound\n\nThe ingame sound suits the game well. The enemys you hear when you go through dungeons, the swing of heavy weapons, its really executed well. BUT the voicacting in this game is really bad. Most of the characters sound like they do not care about their situation at all. They fail to sell you the dark and grim situation they are in. Your maincharacter should not be part of this game, and also does not really care about the things happening around him\n\nStory and Playtime\n\nThe Story really falls flat. Its the basic: The world is getting invaded and you are the only one to save it story. I stopped to care about the story quit early. You can read iteam descritions and listen to the NPCs you meet along the way. But there is not much lore behind the game, you really care about (there is a lot to read, but most of it falls short to games like Dark souls).\nThe playtime of the game is really short! When you are send out to kill the final bosses you have played for like 8-10 hours. I also did a lot of sidemissions and explored a lot. But thits game just feels short. You have dungeons you can explore that are more interesting than the main story, but eventually you will end up doing the main mission.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe good:\n+ Weapons are balanced around their size. Daggers can be used to place fast hits in between your enemys attacks, and heavy swords need a setup time.\n+ Easy to learn, hard to master. If you are new to games like this, you will go for the tank approch using heavy armor and a shild. You can also use light gear and try to parry enemy attacks and use your mobility to fight them\n+ Risk reward mechanic. You can save your XP, or push on through the game trying to increase your multiplier. This gives you the chance to get more XP and better loot. Or to loose it all\n\nThe bad:\n-The bosses. Most of the bosses(not all!) are really boring. The difficulty is mostly increased when they summon additions minions, which is really cheap. Attack patterns mostly focus in one direction, so after you doge the first hit, the boss continues to attack in the wrong direction. I killed most bosses on the first try without any problem.\n- The lock on system. Its a JOKE! Most of the time the game will randomly lock on to an enmy infront of you no matter if another enemy (e.g. boss!) is directly infront of you\n\nIn review\n\nThis game is not perfect. The bosses are mostly push-overs and only some stand out. The gameplay itself is solid. You can challange yourself to play in a certain styl, that will increase the difficulty. I can not denie the fact, liking the game while playing it. If you are unsure, you can wait for the sale to pick it up.\n\nThis game gets a 7,5/10 for me. Solid but can be improved :)","November 4, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VulpusAlbus/recommended/265300/","VulpusAlbus","VulpusAlbus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VulpusAlbus/","229 products in account","This game cannot avoid being compared to the Souls series. So I'll split this review into two parts, first I'll describe it for those, who's not familiar with Souls games, the second part will be a comparison between LOTF and DS1+2\n\n1. If you've never ever played Souls series, this part is for you.\n\nLOTF is a strictly single player game where you most of the time you fight with enemies and spend the rest on rare cinematics, dialogs and playing around with your stats and equipment. Imagine a Diablo game with direct control over a character and you'll get the feeling of what this game consists of. Right, this is a melee-oriented action game, not an RPG.\n\nA good news here is that the action part is great. It's not a Devil May Cry or Castlevania madness of endless combos and dashes, the fight here is much slower, but also more realistic. It requires (mostly) less reaction, but more thinking. The strategy depends greatly on a build you create (which can be changed relatively easy mid-game), but mostly relies on managing stamina and timings. Controls are good and the battles are satisfying. If not, just try another battle style, you can switch whenever you want.\n\nSome claim this game to be hardcore. What this means in this game, is that generally your build and gear do not limit you much, though having higher stats and better equipment definitely helps. You can beat any situation you meet with anything you have. That's great. But the thing is that each time you meet something new it'll try to make you invent a new tactics to overcome it. Bosses have different mechanics. Regular enemies get new weapons with different movesets and defense tools, locations change from corridors to labyrinths, etc. If you can't beat something, you just need to make a stop and ask yourself a question "How should I adapt to this using my resources?" The game is quite balanced in this aspect, even though it's not obvious from the first glance.\n\nThis lead to the next aspect - punishment. The game is planned in a way to kill you. Each time you meet a new type of enemy you could die due to your old tactics not working. Each new boss requires some new strategy to take on him, sometimes you'll not be able to adopt from the first attempt, etc. You'll die, and you'll loose some of the experience that you've gathered lately, and the mobs will respawn. Other than that you don't loose anything at all, so that small piece of experience doesn't matter, you'll get it again from the same mobs.  The point is if something killed you, learn how to avoid it next time and then go kill it yourself. This is a point of the game.\n\nStory wise, it's average. It's enough to explain nicely why you go somewhere killing something, but is not good enough to keep you intrigued like other games do. Not a problem, this game is not played for it's story anyway.\n\n2. How is this similar to or different from Souls?\nI haven't played Demon Souls, so I'm comparing it only to Dark Souls 1 + 2 + DLC for both of them. I don't want to spend you time here as you know the basics, so I'll just provide the list of pros/cons\n\n+ Pros:\nSkill still means much more than stats and equipment\nAlmost identical to DS  battle mechanics\nAlmost identical to DS controls\nArmor really protects you from physical attacks, not just slows you down\nGreat variety of weapons and armors\nArmor comes in sets\nLight and heavy builds differ more than in Souls\nSome regular enemies really make you change tactics\nBosses have unique mechanics\nCan get unique versions of already unique boss weapons\nSide quests seem as side quests, not like hidden achievements you randomly accomplish\nBackstabs and parries still rock\nYou can go to areas where you are not planned to be yet early in the game. Harder enemies for better loot and exp.\nNo cheap deaths and dirty tricks (woo, what a nice narrow roof, and what are that new types of enemies on the other side? New archers of some sort? Gonna come closer to see what they can do :D )\n\n- Cons:\nThe story is much paler\nNo multiplayer\nPoise is not explained in game well enough (attack power vs poise)\nBattle seems slower (in reality it's not that slow, but it seems, dunno why)\nLess variety of enemies\nBosses seem to be much easier\nVery little punishment for death\nLess supply items\nThe world is not seamless\n\n+/- Different:\n"Bonefires" here work differently.\nNo DS-style buffs on weapons\nMelee oriented. Ranged and magic were planned for support mainly.\nWarhammer-like visual style instead of medieval-phantasy style\nNG, NG+, NG++ only, each new plus opens extra options for development of your character\nAction takes place on a much smaller area, but it's planned/detailed much better than in DS\nNo fast travel, but a lot of shortcuts, more like DS1\nCrafting is much simpler, but allows experiments as all materials can be extracted back again\n\nMy personla rant:\nNo guesture to praise the sun? Seriously? C'mon devs, it should be added to all games!\n\nMy personal opinion:\nThis is not DS and not a clone. Don't expect it to give you more DS content. However it's still a singleplayer good game with very similar battle mechanic and a different risk/rewad system. If you liked playing DS without much coo/pvp, you'll probably like this. If you liked playing mi/maxed characted on higher NG+ playthoughs pushing over the edge or played mostly for CooP, I think you could skip this.","November 5, 2014","true","63.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You'll find lots of similar moods and design decisions in this game.\n- Graphics are great. It's not Crysis 3, but lights and particle effects look stunning. Character models are also good.\n\nBAD:\n- PC version's optimization is AWFUL. Frequent crashes (especially last few hours of the game), FPS drops on the high-end PCs, and so on.\n- Camera's behavior is really odd sometimes.\n- Although Dark Souls style, combat is very slow. You may find yourself annoyed by how slow Harkyn's moves are. Especially his rolls.\n- Locations often feel repetitive.\n- Bosses aren't impressive, they're mostly humanoid, and bossfights are not as satisfying as they should be.\n- Rogue style of playthrough is much more difficult than Warrior.\n- The game's too short, I've completed it in 13 hours.\n- Characters' lip-syncing looks incredibly stupid, lips' moves and voices don't match at all.\n\nVERDICT\nI liked the game, and I think it has lots of potential. However, first of all, the devs need to fix the PC version's issues (as I've heard, PS4 version has lots of bugs too) for the game to be playable and enjoyable. I'll be clearly doing a second run as a rogue or warrior after the game is fixed! I'm looking forward to that. As for now, the game is good, but it's not as good as I wanted it to be. And it's definitely not better than Dark Souls or Darksiders.\n\nRATING: 68/100. The game is good.

The first boss noclipped through the floor, forcing me to restart. Then, when i got to the second boss, he froze half of the times i tried to fight him. Instead of getting that crystal wall thing around him, he stood still. I did not want to cheese him, so i restarted. Similar ♥♥♥♥ has happened a lot during the few hours i have played the game\n\nThe voice acting is sub-par at best\n\nThe game is forgiving where it needs to be hard, and hard where it needs to be forgiving. Introducing the player to fighting 2-3 otherwise difficult enemies AT ONCE early in the game, with a high possibility of the boss bugging out and joining in, is a bit harsh.\n\nThe boss fights are a bit tedious, due to the limited movesets, and success just about relies on how heavy your armor is and if you have the decoy spell thing - this needs a nerf, also.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicBytch/recommended/265300/","EpicBytch","Feed The Meat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicBytch/","128 products in account","I have to say this games has its pros and cons just like any other game but I'll just say what I've noticed and you can decide for yourself if you want to try it or not. As a whole, I recommend it if you can get passed the things that drag it down a bit, I personally am satisfied with my purchase but I'm not jumping for joy over the game because I expected a bit more out of it.\n\nSome things I do like very much is that it has a good solid gameplay to it. The blocking in the game feels like actual blocking where you take no damage (if your energy is high enough to block the incoming attack). The weapon attacks are on the realistic side of the line as well; the heavier the weapon, the slower it swings. Even the dodging feels more realistic which could be good for some gamers and bad for others because you may end up dodging and still getting hit (e.g. the enemy swings at waist height and you dodge, the weapon might still hit you because it was low enough).\n\nThe targeting can go both ways in this game, in can be a plus in some cases and a detriment in others, you'll have to decide what you like or dislike about it. The targetting locks on to your enemy of choice and you can swap enemies with a quick tap of your camera controls (Right analog if you use a gamepad) in either direction. The problems I have found with it though is there is no quick way to switch targets if one runs behind you (Which they do as a combat technique). Another issue I have found with it is that you can't target unless you have near full view of the enemy which makes it harder on you when coming through a narrow corridor and, unfortunately, there are invisible objects that can get in your way as well (e.g. I found one enemy standing beside a fire brazier and I couldn't target him even though I could clearly see him).\n\n"Energy" is basically stamina. It is consumed by attacks (Both regular and power attacks though power attacks take more, obviously), blocking, dodging, as well as sprinting. Your energy recharges on its own at a decent rate, just back up out of range of the bad guy's attacks for a few seconds and your energy will fill up quickly. Your energy will still feel up if you are blocking but it will fill up much slower which means you can't just tank all the hits easily, you actually have to employ tactics to get your energy up while still taking as little damage as possible. I've noticed that bosses will have attacks to completely drain your energy (The first two will slap you with their shields to drain your energy to 0).\n\nThe magic of the game can obviously play a good part in the game, I can't say I have gotten very far into the game (About 2 hours of gameplay) but I haven't found a need or even desire to use the magic in the game. The magic really isn't anything fantastic. You can heal yourself somewhat, raise your defence, increase attack, do a magic power attack, make a clone of yourself to distract the enemy, but nothing really all that great. You have three "classes" of magic, each has their own benefits.\n\nVisually it is fairly good. I can't say it has the best graphics in the world but it definitely has high quality. I'm a bit of a graphics snob and this game is good enough for me visually. I do have to say, the character models are lacking in their mesh morphs because the lip sync with the words is extremely off; laughably so. The characters move their mouths in much the same way as a ventriloquist's puppets do, basically just a jaw flapping down and back up, and they don't move in a way that really goes with the words, they just seem to move at random and half of the spoken words in the game don't have lip movements at all.\n\nThe lack of character appearance customization may not appeal to everyone or even might make people completely refuse to play the game. I believe that the lack of character customization is simply because you are playing an existing character in this alternate reality instead of creating one. Unfortunately, there are no appearance choices at all. You don't choose hairstyles, genders, etc. You simply play the guy you see in the trailer with markings all over his face. If that doesn't bother you, then pay no heed to this paragraph (I am not bashing lack of character appearance customization, I don't mind either way depending on the game).\n\nThe movement in the game is rather slow. You run slow, you sprint slow, you dodge slow, you attack slow. Even if you choose the light armor with dual daggers, you still dodge slow. The character is hulking and reminiscent of a golem with his movements. I can honestly say that I went with the daggers first but with the poor movement speed and little to no blocking that you would expect from a lightly armored and quick on their feet character, it was much harder than medium or heavy builds. I honestly didn't see any speed increase with the light build over the heavy build.\n\nYou carry your exp around with you on your character and the more you carry the more you get from killing things. You don't get this reward with no risk, of course. You can't level anything up without spending the experience you have and if you die then all of the experience you have with you drops and you have to run back to where you were to get it. Over time, the experience amount will disipate until there is nothing left to recover. In essence, you gamble the experience you have so that you can earn more; the more you risk, the more you earn.\n\nAll in all, I'm pleased with the game though the cons of the game do bother me a bit. I will consider this an overall positive yet neutral review and I hope it was informative rather than biased.\n\nHere is the biased part:\n\nPros:\n-Good blocking\n-Good weapon weight/speed ratio\n-Good graphics\n-Simple tutorial\n-Great energy recharge rate\n\nCons:\n-Poor lip sync with dialog\n-Invisible walls preventing targeting\n-Targetting can prevent you from quickly turning to block an attack from behind\n-Magic system doesn't seem to be worth the effort\n-No character customization\n-Slow movement even when lightly armored","November 6, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is because high speed weapons do next to no damage to mobs/bosses, you will never be able to use a big weapon as they are far to slow also being to heavy ( fatman rolling ) doesnt work.\nand it wont take long to realise that rolling is pritty much pointless bar a few mobs and side stepping is faster, you stay on your feet for that back stab kill.\n\nThe any mob will kill you aproach to dark souls is not needed to be taken on this game.\n\nBut the big downside to this game is there is no real replay worth,\nAs you can only get items that you havent picked up on your first run so if you explored really well you have already done most things.\nMobs are a little harder to kill as they have more hit points, you know how to kill them and it is so easy you will find that you will go as far as possible without spending exp just for a little bit of risk. so far im just past the 5th boss on the second run through and i havent banked once.\n\nI have put recomended on this game as i have enjoyed playing it, all be that its a little to easy, some times hit reg is a bit dodgy, and there was a few crashes near the end of the game.\n\nBut......\n\nif you are not a hardcore gamer, and you havent spent time on either dark souls game.

Not going to be a long review that way people looking to buy can skim through the mixed reviews. First off this game is fun, don't get me wrong, the main mechanics behind the game are good. The optimization is meh, the art style is good, and the gameplay is decent.\nWhere the game really fails is it's enemy design and how to counter these enemies. The game doesn't give you a choice on how to do something. For example early on in the game there's a shield enemy that can one or two shot you easily, break through your shield, and is IMPOSSIBLE to get around, the only way to kill him is to blast him with magic, there's no other way. The game itself is good but the bosses and enemies are too generic, the game needs artifical difficulty, not diffuculty that's going to ram you in the ♥♥♥. There's a difference between a game with good challange and a game with bad challange, this game tries to give you a challange, which it does, but goes about doing it incorrectly.","February 17, 2015","false","6.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","7"

That being said, there is no excuse for games these days especially non-indie titles, to be released as beta feeling as this game was. Unforunately that seems to be just par for the course these days in the industry and I won't let my personal feelings on that matter apply here.\n\nThis game is a third person action RPG that uses a similar control set-up to the dark souls games and leveling system, but that is where the similarities really end. You do gain and lose your experience by killing/dying and must go to where you died to retrieve your exp. This exp does start to disappear overtime though, and you're not likely to retrieve most of your exp if you're very far from a checkpoint.\n\nThe game's difficulty is not high, and most of the struggles you'll face are at the beginning, and very end of the game. The mid-game seems unbalanced and you will be mowing through most enemies.\n\nThe combat is much faster paced than the Souls games and I'd say it's about a mid-ground between that and Darksiders 2's combat. They did an excellent job of making each weapon type feel differently and I feel the physics here surpass the Souls series by far. The staff weapons were incredibly overpowered during the time I played the game due to it's fast attack speed and good scaling damage. This could always be fixed in balance patches or mods however.\n\nThe bosses were fairly underwhelming, but there are a good variety of enemy types which take different tactics in order to combat as opposed to the souls series (lock on and circle) method of killing just about everything which detracts from my enjoyment of that particular franchise. There were multiple ways to defeat a few of the bosses, and this allowed you to receieve special equipment upon killing them which I thought was a rather neat addition. Some of the weaker and early bosses become elite enemies that you will fight throughout the game as well, forcing you to adapt your combat style when fighting them as well as a group of lesser enemies at the same time.\n\nThere are many collectibles in the game, and while the lore is pretty generic, it's still interesting enough to warrant collecting all the scrolls and finding the secret equipment (which there is a good number of).\n\nThe games length was decent, and it could probably be played through 2-3 times in order to play different styles, and colelct the new game + gear, however, new game+ difficulty does not scale nearly fast enough in order for it to be a challenge.\n\nAs a final note, I do recommend the game, and while it's not anywhere near perfect, there are some innovative ideas here, and I'd like to see a sequel one day improve on what worked, and change what didn't. This is definitely the best game this particular studio has made to date, and I think they should be supported for adding some creativity to this genre which is pretty much dominated by a single franchise at this point.","February 27, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is "soulsy" but it has enough differences in design and gameplay that its not a simple copy. The magic in particular feels a lot different. Since it acts mainly as a secondary combat choice, it never forces you to go full caster. The level design is also different, it feels really full and there are a lot more open spaces than in dark souls, but it is definitely smaller and you can tell. There is no real late game areas, the mobs just get replaced with harder versions. The boss fights were all pretty fun and have cool sub challenges within them. The boss variety does leave something to be desired. Almost all the fights are in some sort of arena. The combat is actually really fun. A lot of people call it clunky but I just think its heavier. Everything just seems to hit harder, you included. For me though its the weapons and armor that really shine.

The game offers a wide variety of weapons and...ARMOR. LOTS AND LOTS OF ARMOR. All the armors looks different and it really looks cool. Heavy armor makes you walk in a different and sluggish style, while light and medium armor makes you more flexible.\n\nIf you are a Dark Souls fan and you're looking for a game in a similair fashion..look no further.\nJust buy the game and enjoy it. Im really looking forward too a sequel.","May 19, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

The combat is also much more sluggish, and less fluid than that in Dark Souls or more recently Bloodborne.\n\nThe story isn't something to cheer for, but it is entertaining nevertheless. I personally enjoyed the game, the visuals were rather nice and beautiful at parts, especially when looking at the God Hand and snowy regions of the world, even if they're in the background.\n\nThe armour and weapon style is badass, though some of the later sets get recycled with just a switch in colour palette. All in all, if you want something to fill the spot for more Dark Souls with less difficulty and easier combat, Lords of the Fallen is something to consider.\n\n7/10 needs more dark souls","June 15, 2015","true","19.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm finding more and more that I have to really analyze my setting before I jump into combat, unlike DS and other similar titles, or the enviroment itself will kill you over and over....and over.

I have moved the game to max settings and it still performs fine but the scenery is beyond breath taking.

It is "soulsy" but it has enough differences in design and gameplay that its not a simple copy. The magic in particular feels a lot different. Since it acts mainly as a secondary combat choice, it never forces you to go full caster. The level design is also different, it feels really full and there are a lot more open spaces than in dark souls, but it is definitely smaller and you can tell. There is no real late game areas, the mobs just get replaced with harder versions. The boss fights were all pretty fun and have cool sub challenges within them. The boss variety does leave something to be desired. Almost all the fights are in some sort of arena. The combat is actually really fun. A lot of people call it clunky but I just think its heavier. Everything just seems to hit harder, you included. For me though its the weapons and armor that really shine. There are a lot of sets and weapons for this size of game and every weapon you get usually is useful at the time you get it.

It does bring its own flair to the series with additions like being healed by your fallen souls instead of just quickly retrieving them.\n\nIt also focuses on a more controlled class design than Dark Souls. In DS, your character can be all over the place with stats and gear, which isn't a bad thing, as it allows you to have complete control over your toon. But LotF has specific class abilities, which do play somewhat different from one another. All the armor and weapons can be used by all three classes, as long as you have the necessary stat requirements. It's much more simplified than DS, so it opens it up to more casual people.\n\nOne of the biggest changes from the DS series though is that bosses have stages. Each boss has three stages they go through depending on how much health they have left. For example, the first boss you fight will be wielding a greatsword and a shield. The more you fight him, he'll begin losing armor and eventually his shield. Then his tactics change and he just goes berserk with only the sword. It makes boss battle more challenging imo. Once you beat a boss, a rift gate opens up that offers an additional challenge. Sometimes it's just a loot rift, other times its a mob of enemies that you have to fight.\n\nPro:\nFun gameplay. Dark Souls like with good powers.\nDifficult enemies: Bosses and regulars offer a decent challenge.\nGreat Visuals: Game looks really good.\nAmazing Armor and Weapons: Both weapons and armor look really cool.\n\nCons:\nBad Optimization: The game has suffered from FPS drops since day one. Even with a powerful rig, you're still gonna get drops no matter what.\nBug: Lots of bugs in this game. It's nowhere near as bad as it was, but it needed more time for polish.\nPointless Story/Characters: The story and characters are pretty pointless. Not once did I care what happened to anyone in the game, and the story is very predictable.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. I wouldn't tell anyone to pick it up at full price, but if you see it on a sale for $20 or less, its completely worth your time. The game was directed to be a more casual friendly DS-like game, but it still offers a good challenge. 7.5/10","April 7, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Especially when wearing heavy armor your character is quite slow which takes some time to get used to.\n\nMy first attempts failed miserably due to the fact that I wasn't accustomed to the game mechanics. Even the very first enemy took me considerable effort to defeat.\nHowever, after you get past that 'hill' and start getting familiar with the controls and how the character behaves the game becomes incredibly fun!\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is awesome: a dark and gritty monastery in which you uncover one horror after the other. Throughout the game you'll find pieces of lore which help you put the puzzle of the story together. My only gripe here is that in the beginning you get dumped into the game without any hook into the story i.e. you have no clue what's going on.\n\nYou can find a huge amount of different weapons and armor, each with different stats and abilities and all of them look incredibly cool! The game is also loaded with many secrets which can be uncovered like special equipment, hidden treasure chests, special Portals after defeating bosses etc.\n\nThe boss fights (i.e. the Lords) are a mix: some of them are quite easy while others are extremely hard. It takes time to learn their attack patterns and to equip yourself appropriately. Especially the final boss was a tough nut to crack. However, I have to add it never felt impossible i.e. even for the difficult fights you will manage to do a substantial amount of damage so that gives hope that it can be pulled off on a next attempt.\n\nSaving is done by means of checkpoints. So when you die you start back at a previous point and all enemies are back. Initially I didn't like this until I understood this is the core of the game: you have to redo parts in order to get more XP so you become more powerfull for the later game.\n\nWhen the game is completed you can start a new game +. This allows you to carry over all equipment of your previous playthrough. In addition it allows you to select a new school of Magic. So in this way you can eventually level up in all three schools which is quite nice.\n\nTo conclude a couple of minor points which I found:\n- There is no Quest log, so it's hard to keep track of some side Quests. Taking notes is required.\n- There is no map, so you have to have a good memory where everything is located.\n- Most of the secrets in the game are not hinted at by the in-game lore. So some you will find by chance while the rest you can only find by looking at forum posts or youtube vids. It would have been much nicer if this info could be gathered from the game itself.\n- Even after finishing the game I'm still strugging sometimes with the controls (using Controller). In most cases this is caused by the fact that sprinting, rolling and jumping is one and the same button. So more often that not when I want to sprint to perform a heavy leap attack ... my character just rolls and bounces against the enemy only to get pounded. When wanting to jump over a gap ... my character just rolls and fall in the depths. These nuisances could have been avoided by a better control sheme.\n\nMy final verdict is that it's a great game. It takes some time getting into it, but when you remain persistent (and patient) it becomes an awesome game!\n\nNote: After upgrading to Windows 10 I always got a crash when starting a new game. Disabling the NVidia Turbulence fixed this issue.","August 9, 2015","true","41.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot of areas loop around without you even thinking about it.\n\nCons-The game is way too easy. And I mean WAYYYY too easy. I only died on one boss due to a instakill spell but as soon as you find out how to avoid it he goes down as easily as the rest. Even the final boss is a cakewalk, he went down in a couple of attacks and did hardly any damage to me.\n-Some weapons are just blatently better than others.\n-Not a fan of the armor design personally. Armor is 90% shoulderpads.\n-Too short. I think I finished the game in about 10 hours or so. For a first run that is just way too short.\n\nThe game is too short and easy to justify the 50 dollar price tag. Wait for a sale or something and if you haven't already played it, I recommend picking up Dark Souls instead of this game. It's cheaper, more challenging and longer than Lords of the Fallen.\n\nTL;DRToo short and easy.\nBuy on sale.\nBuy Dark Souls instead.","October 29, 2014","false","12.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Easier, and more linear story-progression.\n\nWhat I actually got: No story at all, uninteresting characters and flat voice-acting, run-of-the-mill "dark fantasy" world, with evil demonic tossers, invading a gothic world. Combat i more slow-paced than Dark Souls, at least to me, as there is barely ever an opening in your enemies guard, and it takes three years to raise your shield after finishing an attack. Also, half the time, you take damage or get stunned, even though you're rolling.\nNo enemy variety either, bosses: Tall guys with swords.\nNormal minions: Guy with axe, guy with shield, guy with crossbow, idiotic  and blind abominations and then spiders.\nIt feels clunky and unpolished, even though you figured out the attack pattern of an enemy, you will rarely get a proper chance to attack without taking damage yourself, because after an attack, your character goes to an idle animation before being able to raise the shield or gtfo of the way.\n\nAlso, it took me 40 minutes to get the game running. And it still ran pretty bad, with severe FPS drops.\n\nIt does show a lot of potential, but perhaps this is just the extent of the developers capabilitites. Taken into account their other releases, that is very likely the reason.","January 12, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gauntlet is useless except in the early game when you don't have the damage to take on the large shield knights, and against the ghosts near the end, because they can't be hit by anything else. Blocking is worthless because you'll either be light enough to evade everything or heavy enough to only take single-digit damage.

It is a horribly made game.  I know several people have called it a "hidden gem" or "dark souls lite" but I would suggest you play dark souls instead.  Lets start off with a break down of pros and cons.\n\nPros\n1.  Graphically better for the most part\n2.  Sound is better\n3.  It has voice acting and tries to flesh out its story more directly than a souls game.\n4.  Linear for the most part, save for a few areas it is hard to get lost.  You just keep going forward and you will eventually find your way through most roadblocks.\n\nCons\n1.  Uninspired enviornments.  You will spend most of your time trudging through dark areas or fiery areas.  Do not expect vibrant areas with variety.  You are either in castles, caves, or some mixture of the two.\n2.  Very glitchy.  I have seen enemies scale invisible ladders and get stuck in the sky box only to be unattackable save for magic.  This might not have been a problem if I went full magic, but using the warrior archtype I had to use one or two spells then wait for magic to regenerate.\n3.  The magic feels underwhelming.  I did go melee but I had a decent amount of faith, my magic however depleted far faster than I feel it should have to be effective.  This may be due to an armor penalty but I noticed no difference in magic consumption between heavy and medium armors.\n4.  Magic/Skills feel uninspired in this game, like they were tacked on as an afterthought.  Some skills felt outright useless and others felt like they were completely overpowered.  As a warrior I could pop rage and just power through most boss fights in one or two uses.\n5.  Enemy AI is terrible.  Souls games aren't known for great AI, but they are HAL 9000 whem compared to LotF AI.  Boss attacks are far to easy to bait out with encounters and offer very little in the way of challenge.\n6.  When you get lost, you get lost hard.  While many areas you can just head forward, there are some places where you can find yourself walking around for hours trying to find out where to go simply because the game has a very poor progression funnel in certain areas (I am looking at you Annihilator).\n7.  Combat feels sluggish and can swing from boring to frustrating very quickly.  Once again I am viewing this from the warrior archtype, but two handed weapons have such a long wind up and awkward attack angles they feel like Harken is more of a flailing idiot than any skilled warrior.  Some enemies would stand there and take it while others would dance around or attack endlessly giving you little to no chance to recover or plan a counter attack.\n8.  The kick is useless.  It requires a huge amount of stamina and I have yet to see it be more efficient at breaking a turtling enemy than just spamming attack combos and smashing through them.\n9.  Exploding enemies.  Har har you have a booby trapped enemy that explodes on death.  Real cute and I could let that one slide, except these enemies are usually very powerful and there are far too many of them in the latter half of the game.  There is a specific mage type enemy that can deal horrendous ranged damage, put up a damage shield around him, drain your life, and has an annoyingly fast melee attack that will knock you down.  The blast radius of the explosion will result in you taking damage more often than not.\n10.  Main quests have a tracker and sub quests do not.  This is just annoying.  If you don't want a quest tracker fine, but don't go half way.  Either let us choose the quest to track or make us use a log.\n11.  Quest NPC's can just up sticks and leave.  This may be a glitch, but when I tried to turn in human skulls for a quest the quest giver just decided he had better things to do and went fishing or something, because he wasn't there when I arrived to turn in.\n12.  Rune upgrade system feels tacked on.  You can use runes to upgrade your equipment, but don't expect any major changes to your playstyle.  Some runes will provide enough of a benefit to give you notice, but most are borderline useless.\n13.  The game is just a slog.  Nearing the latter half of the game I just wanted it to be over.  Playing it felt more like a chore and less like entertainment.  The fighting was uninspired, there is very little enemy variety (plenty of reskins though).\n14.  The story is about a generic as you can get.  You can smell the plot twist coming from a mile away.  Some side elements have no effect on the story.  The ending is a carbon copy rip off of Fallout 3 where specific choices are recapped.\n15.  Damage scaling makes little to no sense.  I had a harder time fighting the lightly armored twin swordsman rogues than I did fighting mages or heavy knights.  My armor offered no defense against their all melee damage and they could begin an attack after my starting frame and stun me with a single hit before I was able to connect.  In the latter half of the game poise becomes a useless stat as any human enemy can stagger you with one strike.\n\nThe game is exactly what it is trying to be, a cheaply made knock off of souls trying to cash in on its success.  They took out a lot of the components that made the Souls games fun and shoveled in AAA game concepts that just hobbled our outright broke the experience.  Stats and builds become more important than skill the further you get into the game.  With appropriate skill and planning I can do a SL1 4 kings run and become a darkwraith, but in this game I just don't see that being especially viable.  Doable?  Yes, but I doubt you would get any enjoyment out of it.  The armor looks nice but at the same time it appears ripped clean out of Warhammer without any editing (the trinket flags look suspiciously like the mark of Chaos).  If you want to experience this game just get a Souls game, you will save money and derive more enjoyment from it.  Souls is a better designed game, hands down, and while it may appear "more difficult" the difficulty feels less hamhanded.

It was a big underrated imo. Having said that though, it does suffer from a lot of problems. LotF is basically a Dark Souls clone, but that's not necessary a bad thing. It does bring its own flair to the series with additions like being healed by your fallen souls instead of just quickly retrieving them.\n\nIt also focuses on a more controlled class design than Dark Souls. In DS, your character can be all over the place with stats and gear, which isn't a bad thing, as it allows you to have complete control over your toon. But LotF has specific class abilities, which do play somewhat different from one another. All the armor and weapons can be used by all three classes, as long as you have the necessary stat requirements. It's much more simplified than DS, so it opens it up to more casual people.\n\nOne of the biggest changes from the DS series though is that bosses have stages. Each boss has three stages they go through depending on how much health they have left. For example, the first boss you fight will be wielding a greatsword and a shield. The more you fight him, he'll begin losing armor and eventually his shield. Then his tactics change and he just goes berserk with only the sword. It makes boss battle more challenging imo. Once you beat a boss, a rift gate opens up that offers an additional challenge. Sometimes it's just a loot rift, other times its a mob of enemies that you have to fight.\n\nPro:\nFun gameplay. Dark Souls like with good powers.\nDifficult enemies: Bosses and regulars offer a decent challenge.\nGreat Visuals: Game looks really good.\nAmazing Armor and Weapons: Both weapons and armor look really cool.\n\nCons:\nBad Optimization: The game has suffered from FPS drops since day one. Even with a powerful rig, you're still gonna get drops no matter what.\nBug: Lots of bugs in this game. It's nowhere near as bad as it was, but it needed more time for polish.\nPointless Story/Characters: The story and characters are pretty pointless. Not once did I care what happened to anyone in the game, and the story is very predictable.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. I wouldn't tell anyone to pick it up at full price, but if you see it on a sale for $20 or less, its completely worth your time. The game was directed to be a more casual friendly DS-like game, but it still offers a good challenge. 7.5/10","April 7, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is unacceptable.\nI had to disable nvidia turbulence, disable cromatic aberration (ugly and terrible decision to include this in the game) and disable most post processing options to get back to 50-80 fps.\nNow my problem is that I get totally random crashes while playing (most of the time during boss fights, which is infuriating).\nThe game itself has decent story and good graphics but suffers from a problem: It wants to be a "Dark Souls Clone". And it fails.\nIf the devs would give the player the ability to save at any point, the game would probably last 3-4 hours max with all sidequests done, so this means the game is artificially lengthned by this gimmick saving point system.\nAlso the camera issues while fighting are real and most often than not responsible for ridiculous deaths of your char and more wasted time.\nFighting responsiveness is also close to none which on a fighting game really says it all. There will be plenty of times when your char will not respond accurately to the controls.\nI would recommend this game ONLY if you get it on a sale around $10 (or lower) , it's not a AAA title in any way with this kind of technical issues.\nAt the current price point, in January 2015, please find something else to play as this game is somehow still in "beta testing".\nPeace,\nSycharth","January 18, 2015","false","35.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unfortunately the game fails to live up to the one it was based upon in every way, but most of all, the combat. The combat feels clunky, slow (even by Souls standards) and repetitive, with no rewarding and satysfying victories which feel rather hollow. The bosses have nothing to offer, all being virtually the same. The story is quite uninspiring and the main character is as generic as can be, with no option to create your own character at all.\n\nIt really isn't enough to take some elements from the Souls games to mae equally good game, the devs seem to have failed to understand what makes the Souls series so great...\n\nAnother disappointing release of 2014, which seems to be the trend.

A lot of areas loop around without you even thinking about it.\n\nCons-The game is way too easy. And I mean WAYYYY too easy. I only died on one boss due to a instakill spell but as soon as you find out how to avoid it he goes down as easily as the rest. Even the final boss is a cakewalk, he went down in a couple of attacks and did hardly any damage to me.\n-Some weapons are just blatently better than others.\n-Not a fan of the armor design personally. Armor is 90% shoulderpads.\n-Too short. I think I finished the game in about 10 hours or so. For a first run that is just way too short.\n\nThe game is too short and easy to justify the 50 dollar price tag. Wait for a sale or something and if you haven't already played it, I recommend picking up Dark Souls instead of this game. It's cheaper, more challenging and longer than Lords of the Fallen.\n\nTL;DRToo short and easy.\nBuy on sale.\nBuy Dark Souls instead.","October 29, 2014","false","12.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Easier, and more linear story-progression.\n\nWhat I actually got: No story at all, uninteresting characters and flat voice-acting, run-of-the-mill "dark fantasy" world, with evil demonic tossers, invading a gothic world. Combat i more slow-paced than Dark Souls, at least to me, as there is barely ever an opening in your enemies guard, and it takes three years to raise your shield after finishing an attack. Also, half the time, you take damage or get stunned, even though you're rolling.\nNo enemy variety either, bosses: Tall guys with swords.\nNormal minions: Guy with axe, guy with shield, guy with crossbow, idiotic  and blind abominations and then spiders.\nIt feels clunky and unpolished, even though you figured out the attack pattern of an enemy, you will rarely get a proper chance to attack without taking damage yourself, because after an attack, your character goes to an idle animation before being able to raise the shield or gtfo of the way.\n\nAlso, it took me 40 minutes to get the game running. And it still ran pretty bad, with severe FPS drops.\n\nIt does show a lot of potential, but perhaps this is just the extent of the developers capabilitites.

It is "soulsy" but it has enough differences in design and gameplay that its not a simple copy. The magic in particular feels a lot different. Since it acts mainly as a secondary combat choice, it never forces you to go full caster. The level design is also different, it feels really full and there are a lot more open spaces than in dark souls, but it is definitely smaller and you can tell. There is no real late game areas, the mobs just get replaced with harder versions. The boss fights were all pretty fun and have cool sub challenges within them. The boss variety does leave something to be desired. Almost all the fights are in some sort of arena. The combat is actually really fun. A lot of people call it clunky but I just think its heavier. Everything just seems to hit harder, you included. For me though its the weapons and armor that really shine.

Shield bash breaks the entire game (you can do damage as fast as you can click the bash button which trivializes everything). Playing without a shield, on the other hand, is unplayably annoying because the game loves enemies that block 95% of the time and you can't get past blocks without a shield (or at least I haven't figured out how, the kick is pathetic) - you have to wait until they charge, hit once, wait again, repeat. Boring.\n\nFPS is terrible on my pretty high-ish-end system (your mileage might wary) until I turned most of the graphical fanciness off, and it still dips at times. Plot is awful and utterly nonsensical, feels like they cut most of it out and forgot to fill the blanks because the dialogue makes absolutely zero sense at some points.\n\nIt's not irredeemably bad - the combat has a great feeling of weight to it and is pretty fun-ish when you're not fighting shield enemies or bashing everything.

This review might also contain spoilers, so if you yourself have not done a playthrough please be aware of that as well.)\n\nWith that being said my first few moments within this game seemed rushed, from the forefront im already thrown right into a battle with a subpar and quite the low description of what (is) happening in the world around me.\n\nThe story starts off slow and bland at times and continues that trend till the ending credits, i don't know if the dev's intended this to keep you in combat at all times and steer their audience away from a linear story of sorts but i didn't enjoy that personally.\n\nAs the game progresses a repeat of NPC voices appears quite frequently along with the trend of demons being the same as well, although at times you face variations in sizes, strengths, weapons, and abilities it all contains the same handful.

It's so similar that the controls are virtually identical when using the "alternate" control scheme.  Even the special moves have the same controls, ie parry/riposte, jump attack, backstab, rolling attack.\n\nThe world is a decent size but pretty small compared to Dark Souls, and it all kinda looks the same.  Maybe equivalent to about 3 areas in Dark Souls.  The game does encourage you to go back to old areas to find new items and open doors that were previously locked, but when you go back most of the enemies are trivially easy to defeat so it's not that great.  The combat is pretty similar to Dark Souls too.  You can use shield+weapon, or dual hand weapons for more powerful/faster attacks.  I found the strength based weapons painfully slow to use, but the agility based weapons behaved a lot more like Dark Souls.  It also has the Dark Souls system of fatroll vs fastroll depending on what % of your carrying weight you are using.  The enemies have a decent variety although nowhere near what you'll find in Dark Souls simply because it's a much smaller world.  The animations and hitboxes are a bit off sometimes though.  You get used to it but it's nowhere near as "crisp" as Dark Souls.\n\nThe game also has a system of weapon/armor upgrades where you place runes into slots, but a lot of weapons don't even have any slots for runes, and even the ones that do usualy only have one slot.  Because of this most of the runes don't actually make a huge difference.  Sort of like upgrading a weapon to +5 or something in Dark Souls, instead of being able to go to +10 or +15.  You can also add things like poison/fire/magic to your weapon but because most weapons only have one slot you are sacrificing physical damage to use those runes.\n\nThe story in the game is pretty generic and boring.  That's not the reason I bought this game, but even so this is one of the areas where if differs from Dark Souls the most.  Dark Souls has a very subtle/mysterious story and lore that you could totally miss if you weren't paying attention, whereas LOTF hits you over the head with it.  Luckily there isn't a ton of dialogue/cutscenes but still a lot more than Dark Souls.\n\nThis game also has no multiplayer at all.  No PVP or co-op which really limits the replayability of the game.  I would also say it's easier than Dark Souls as long as you have the right weapon for your playstyle.  Maybe that's just because I've played a lot of Dark Souls though.\n\nWhatever performance issues the game had when it was first released, they seem to be sorted out now.  The game ran perfectly for me.  I think it's worth getting on sale for someone itching for some more Dark Souls-like gameplay.  Just realize before buying it that you probably won't like it as much as Dark Souls.  I hope more devs in the future try to create games like this though, hopefully with some more original ideas in them too.","December 3, 2015","true","21.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

The game is different compared to Dark Souls yet similar. Combat is slower and it really feels like your character is wielding a massive weapon. It really makes the hits you deal feel satisfying. I played as a pure wreckingball wearing the heaviest of armours and a masssive 2h greatsword/axe and I always enjoyed the fights. I didn't experience any clunkiness in contrary to other reviewers. I cannot really comment on the spells since I only used the projectile of the gauntlet to pull enemies.\n\nI think the game felt a bit short, I spent 12.5 hours on my first playthrough although I didn't visited previously explored places to retrieve all treasure. I did enjoy every minute of it besides getting lost a couple of times.

And in some ways it's similar. It does have the same weighty combat system, where you have to commit to each and every one of your attacks, that have lengthy animations and can not be interrupted mid-swing by the player; hits received, however, will stop your attack. You need to know the attack patterns of all enemies you encounter to survive in the first half of the game, looking for opportunities to strike without losing precious HP.\n\nHP in this game can be restored in 3 ways - by a trinket called Life Leech that I personally only got in the later part of the game, that gives you HP for every monster you kill; by casting a Prayer spell, that acts as a decoy for your enemies and also regenerates a little bit of your health; and, most efficiently, by drinking health potions. Your supply of potions is limited and can only be restored by using a Shard - a checkpoint, essentially - or by dying.\n\nThis works really well with another system in place - the XP modifier. The more monsters you kill without using a checkpoint or dying, the more XP you get for each consequent kill, up to 2.0 times more XP for kill. This is very handy, but forces you to refrain from healing and restocking at checkpoints for longer and longer. The game's progress still can be saved at a checkpoint without losing the modifier, but that will not restock your potions and health. It is also said that the more XP you have "banked" - kept unspent with a risk of losing it - the better loot you can get.\n\nThis all makes for a thrilling experience, where your stakes are high, and combat feels important, as every monster you meet has a good chance of killing you.\nThat said, the feeling only lasts throughtout the first half of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, as you grow stronger, especially if you min-max the ♥♥♥♥ out of your character the way I did it, the fights get easier and easier. In the beginning bossfights took tries and tries to win, and even ordinary monsters had me respawning time after time. By the time I entered the Rhogar Realm for the first time, after, apparently before my time, killing the Rhogar Lord the Champion (I've killed him 4th, later discovering that he should've been the 5th boss to die), I felt immensely powerful. I still could be killed, don't get me wrong, and I died quite a few times when I goofed up, but most of the fights came to "Bash-Leap-Dodge-Repeat", with some enemies often dying from one heavy attack after being bashed in the face with a Tower Shield.\n\nBoss fights, while each having their own mechanics and even bonus difficulty conditions rewarded with special loot, got easier. 5th and 6th bosses I've met I've killed in 2 minutes and 50 seconds respectively. Last two bosses took me two tries each, in contrast with the 3rd boss that took 6.\n\nThe game also feels short. It took me 14 hours to beat it for the first time, and the ending certainly feels a bit abrupt, and not much is explained to you, definitely setting the players up for a sequel.\n\nOverall, Lords of the Fallen has very solid mechanics, absolitely GORGEOUS look to it, wonderful aesthetic and atmosphere, but feels like the developers ran out of steam in the second half of the game, quickly wrapping it up with whatever good ideas they still had. It's a great experience, yet short, and it definitely could use some more difficulty in the end.","December 29, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/axarydax/recommended/265300/","axarydax","Axarydax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/axarydax/","904 products in account","This game was inspired by Dark Souls, with emphasis on the combat execution, sharp controls and tough enemies. I liked that this game is fair, so whenever you got killed, you were aware why that happened. Also the game does reward the more curious and determined players by having plenty of secrets, or several tougher side-quests. Your choice of magic and weaponry does affect the gameplay significantly, I found myself testing out different weapons against different enemies, because the different weapons have different moves. Your agility is also affected by how much you are burdened, so playing as a dual-knife-wielding rogue in cloth armor feels very different from a steel-clad knight waving a giant polesword.\n\nGraphics and enemy design are very satisfying, sometimes stepping into the grotesque, but nothing that breaks the atmosphere. Detailed textures, particle effects, good animations - all present. As you play along, you get to know each enemy type and how to beat them. But sometimes the bad guys synergize in a killer combinations and then you have to pull them from the pack and dispatch them one by one.\n\nLevel design is also inspired by Dark Souls, using a hub-like system with interconnected locations, where you unlock shortcuts as you progress, eliminating the need for fast travel system, as everything is relatively nearby. This can lead to confusion at times, because the in-game objectives are quite vague, so once or twice I needed to take a look at a guide to see what to do next.\n\nOverall, I cannot avoid comparing Lords to the Souls. This feels like a love letter to Dark Souls, but is a good game on its own. The missing piece, why I won't be playing it over and over again, is the absence of multiplayer, which added so much to Dark Souls - observing, how others beat the boss, checking out different builds and movesets. Here you are all alone.\n\nYes, I would buy it again.","November 14, 2015","true","20.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Also note that I have played over 300 h of Dark Souls and DSII combined, so whatever I say about the difficulty should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nI liked the game. If you can pick it up a good discount and you need your Souls fix then go for it. That being said, the game has it fair share of issues. I've had a bug where messages telling me a door or chest needed a key would stop appearing about halfway through my playthrough. Damage number also didn't show up any more. Other than that, I had a mostly bug-free experience, eventhough the camera can sometimes be finnicky, especially in tight quarters.\n\nOn my i7 5th Gen CPU and GTX 780 GPU the game ran smooth pretty much from start to finish. I've had FPS loss some times, but only ever for short periods of time and never below 30.\nThe game looks absolutely gorgeous, both in terms of the art design and the graphics themselves. I loved all the designs, from enemies to armor to the environment. Certain areas can look a bit too similar at times, which leads to a bit of confusion, but overall this game looks - and sounds - very good.\n\nTalking about confusing, the layout of the game is very reminiscent of Dark Souls aswell, with a lot of play area in a rather small geographical space. Most areas are interconnected and exploring to find secret passages is a lot of fun.\n\nThe last point I wanna talk about is the game play itself. I'm not gonna tell you how it's a lot like Dark Souls, you probably already guessed that. I'd rather point out the for me biggest flaw with the gameplay.\nThe player is too slow. Not by much. But just enough to be frustrating in certain places. What I mean by that is that after you attack with most weapons you have a short "downtime", a second or so during which you just stand there and can't move or roll away. This by itself is fine, a lot of games have that. But the downtime is just that bit too long, meaning that a lot of the time enemies can punish you for an attack and there is nothing you can do. Their afterswing and stagger just are too short. So with certain enemies winning isnt a matter of being more skilled, it's just a matter of the AI not capitalising on your after swing downtime to combo you to death.\nOn the other hand, I found the later bosses to be fairly easy, almost push overs actually.\n\n\nSo, in the end, would I reccommend this game? If you have played Dark Souls and you're waiting for Dark Souls III and need your fix, then pick it up on sale.\nIf you haven't played Dark Souls yet, go play Dark Souls. It's cheaper and aside from the graphics simpily a better game.","December 26, 2015","true","18.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Game suffers from the inclusion of certain moves such as the shield charge and also magic spells that remove the challenge of the base combat. I would suggest that the magic system be reworked or removed in favor of being replaced by the magical abilities of the weapons being augmented with the faith stat. The most difficult battle may be the first boss which may also be the most balanced, fun and challenging; this is how the whole game should remain.

And it definitely does. But a key point I've only seen one other reviewer make is that it also feels just as similair to Darksiders with a bit of Shadows of Mordor. If you enjoyed any 3 of those games you should pick this game up (preferably on sale!).\n\nThe Good, Neutral, and Bad\n\n+ The difficulty curve is very well done, boss fights are about half as hard as Soulsborne bosses I'd say, but some of the regular enemies can be just as difficult and annoying.  Just make sure you're upgrading your weapons, armor, and stats as you go!\n\n+ Really liked the XP multiplier mechanic, sometimes it's worth it to go big and not use a checkpoint since the XP can go all the way up to being doubled what you'd normally get.\n\n+ I don't normally like using Magic all that much in 3rd Person Action RPGs, with the exception of Shadows of Mordor, but I really liked it here. You have regular spells which can buff/heal/distract and you also have what's called a Gauntlet, which is a cannon-like thing on your hand that shoots 3 different styles (Shotgun blast-like, Projectile, and Explosive/Grenade). More importantly you can imbue the different shot styles with elements (Poison, Fire, Magic, etc) which more likely than not will provide a great DoT. The fact that some of the Gauntlet shots go through shields of enemies sometimes proved INVALUABLE, as some of the Tower Shielded foes can be very hard to hit and provide a very small window to attack them after they do. Just imbue some fire to a projectile and watch those suckers burn behind their wall of wood.\n\n= Generic fantasy medieval setting, but the graphics are above average\n\n= Combat will be very familiar to any Souls vet, albeit a little clunkier, and without the fantastic multiple combos the series is known for.\n\n- My biggest complaint is the fact that there is no multiplayer at all. At the very least I feel like the game could of excelled from having a designated phased area where players could PVP, there's a good enough diversity in builds and playstyles to support it staying relatively fresh. Co-Op could of worked well too.\n\n- My second biggest complaint is just a personal one and it's more a QoL issue. There's no Fast Travel. You'll have to do a bit of backtracking in the game at some points (the game does provide numerous shortcuts though thankfully), and you might want to return to earlier levels to farm/hunt for items so the fact that there is no Fast Travel at any point in the game can be quite the bummer at times. I'm not asking for a Fast Travel for every checkpoint crystal, as there are numerous, but an option to port to the beginning of each major area would of been nice.\n\nOverall I'd give it a solid 8/10. No more, no less.\n\nIf you've played the Soulsborne series to death and are itching for a fix before the GOTY 2016 holy grail masterpiece god-sent Dark Souls 3 comes out, pick this up.","January 30","true","40.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game isn't perfect, but it's a lot of fun and I highly recommend it if you can catch it on sale (I bought it for $9.99).\n\nGraphicsMy PC isn't top-of-the-line by today's standards, but I was able to keep visual settings pretty high and maintain a solid framerate. The environments are beautiful, your character looks like a total badass no matter what weapon or armor combination you equip, the common enemies are well-designed and intimidating enough, the Lords are terrifying, and the animations are smooth. There was never a moment in-game where I was disappointed in the visuals, but I guess if I'm digging for a "con" here, I'd say that there wasn't a huge variety in the environments.\n\nSoundSometimes, music and sound effects can make or break a game experience for me, but this wasn't one of those times. The theme song is great and there were a couple of times when the music crescendoed while I was fighting a Lord (which was cool and added to the "badass" factor), but for the most part, I didn't notice the music at all in this game. That's okay, I guess. The sound effects were impressive, especially the growls and roars of enemies and the impacts of weapons against shields and walls. The one thing I really wished as I was playing through the game was that enemy footsteps were more audible. There are times when you find yourself navigating corridors where enemies are patrolling, and you should be able to hear that big dude with the axe stomping around just down the hall...but you can't.\n\nThe voice acting was well-performed throughout the game. Some were better than others, but for the most part, these people did a good job (the most cringeworthy line in the whole game is probably Harkyn's "My vow of defiance!" in the opening sequence).\n\nStoryOkay, to be fair, the story isn't what will draw you into this particular game, but it is well-crafted, and so many minor details are revealed through picking up scrolls, which activate voiceovers that describe enemies, experiences, or locations. Even if you don't find yourself caring about the lore, you learn more and more through the words of characters that you haven't even met...and this is often a rewarding experience. You learn more about this world and its history if you care to, but it feels more alive, regardless. There were people here before you, and you get to hear their stories and connect the pieces for yourself.\n\nGameplayThis is it. This is why you start the game, and this is why you continue it...even after you've been killed 30+ times by the same enemy and you curse so loudly that you wake up your wife and fear for your marriage. The gameplay is just. So. GOOD. Okay, okay, with the boss fights, it sometimes feels less like you're exploiting weaknesses and more like you're just memorizing patterns, but for some inexplicable reason, it's still fun. Blocking, dodging, rolling, slashing, thrusting--it all feels so...right. Now, granted, it takes a while to get there, and it takes even longer if you're experimenting with different weapon types, but once you get the hang of it, this combat experience is beautiful.\n\nMy first piece of advice: don't just spam your attack buttons. This took me a while to figure out, but each weapon type has a narrow interval after each swing (slash, thrust, etc.) when you should activate your next attack for a quicker follow-up, with less of an impact on your energy. You can even practice this without enemies around--just try out different combinations and watch your energy bar. It will flash with each perfectly-timed attack.\n\nAlso keep an eye on your equipment and Endurance. If your Weight score is green, you'll move and execute combinations more quickly (this may be less important for warriors wearing heavy armors and shields, but I played primarily with short swords and daggers, so speed was extremely important).\n\nYou have quite a few customization options as far as character development and equipment, but you need to keep a few things in mind. This is a combat RPG with a strong emphasis on melee combat. Your ranged attacks are limited to spells and your gauntlet, which also uses up your magic. In general, you won't be fighting or killing enemies from a distance. You also won't be collecting tons of loot and trading/selling items. It's just not that type of game. Personally, I was okay with that...lately, when I've played some other RPGs, I've hoped that the enemy I just killed didn't drop anything, because it felt more like work than play to be constantly managing my inventory.  There are runes that you can equip to weapons and armor, and there are attributes that you can improve as you progress, but this is not nearly as involved as, say, Skyrim or Diablo or even Borderlands.\n\nSummaryTo sum things up: Lords of the Fallen is an excellent combat RPG. Just know what you're getting before you get it. You'll die (probably a lot), but the combat is amazing, and you'll feel a sense of accomplishment with each enemy that you defeat.","January 10","true","32.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are, however, a few aspects where they chose to differ from the Souls formula which I appreciate:\nThe story is a lot easier to follow in LOTF. While it might not be as deep, it's not necessary to read through item descriptions to get any idea of what is actually happening in the story.\nYou know what you need to do next. It doesn't show you exactly where to go or how to do it, but you know what is the next step for the main quest. They don't track the sidequests though, so that is still the same, and I think its better that way.\nIt's not as difficult as Dark Souls. Yes, it is difficult, and you have to be tactical in your attacks, but it doesn't have that same difficult feel as Dark Souls, and therefore is a lot easier for people getting into this kind of combat. Looking at the difficulty, I would probably recommend playing this first, then moving on to Dark Souls (if you enjoy it). For more seasoned Dark Souls players (like myself) it's a great place to come and relax while experiencing that same tactical combat that has absolutely addicted you to Dark souls.\nA little more detail on CONS:\nFor all the things LOTF does right, there are certain things that I miss from Dark Souls. Maybe they will expand this with the sequel, we can only hope:\nWeapon crafting. Yes, I know you have the whole runes thing, but I genuinely miss picking a weapon and then building that weapon as I build my character. The closest I have gotten to that in LOTF is putting a Luck rune into a weapon so it scales with my stats.\nThe magic system and character development. These two goes hand in hand for me, because in LOTF your magic class limits how you play. I prefer the Dark Souls system where you can mould your character in any way you see fit. Your starting class only determines how you start, the rest is up to you. Would probably be better if the magic system in LOTF had a little more variety,.\nVery little environment. You're in a castle. Then you go to a different realm, where you're basically in a castle. The world feels the same, no matter where you go. To it's credit, I think the level design is brilliant with everything interlinking, providing numerous shortcuts to different areas,\nI've had many hours of enjoyment in this title, and still play it often. So despite all its shortcomings, I definitely recommend it.\n\nA NOTE ON CRASHES: In all my time playing this, I've had only 1 major CTD (after playing for about 4 hours) and I used to have occasional issues when starting it up. This was all before patch 1.6 (the latest) and I have been playing happily ever since.","January 29","true","89.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I actually played it back to back (two different play throughs) with using two different builds (Cleric then Rogue). If you are new to this type of game, i would recommend starting with a cleric build. These builds can take a beating and Protect spell will allow for ample healing later on the game. It plays like a Souls game (concept wise) but I don't think it is a fair comparison. I'm a huge Souls fan and appreciate the mechanics of the game genre.\n\nMany reviews state the game play is slow for combat. This is somewhat true. Most of the weapons are heavy and require good timing to swing, but this adds the reality to the fighting. Two handed weapons would be this slow in true combat.\n\nI think if you approach this game with the mindset of having a Souls experience, you may be disappointed, but if you keep in mind that this is more of a mechanics type of souls experience then you will enjoy the game. in my opinion the game starts off as hard as a Souls game but you eventually build your charactor high enough were you start dominating the game, unlike souls, no matter how high you level up you are still always vulnerable.\n\nin any case. Great graphics, cool environment (levels do connect like the original Dark Souls 1 levels), fun fighting. Story is OK. But this is a fun play (while you are waiting for Souls III :) ).\n\nMy only complaint on the game would be the camera angle. At time during battle the camera will move to an angle where some part of the environment would block your view. This was annoying at times but only happened a handful of times throughout the game.\n\nEnjoy","December 20, 2015","true","77.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Heavy armor makes you walk in a different and sluggish style, while light and medium armor makes you more flexible.\n\nIf you are a Dark Souls fan and you're looking for a game in a similair fashion..look no further.\nJust buy the game and enjoy it.

Especially when wearing heavy armor your character is quite slow which takes some time to get used to.\n\nMy first attempts failed miserably due to the fact that I wasn't accustomed to the game mechanics. Even the very first enemy took me considerable effort to defeat.\nHowever, after you get past that 'hill' and start getting familiar with the controls and how the character behaves the game becomes incredibly fun!\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is awesome: a dark and gritty monastery in which you uncover one horror after the other. Throughout the game you'll find pieces of lore which help you put the puzzle of the story together. My only gripe here is that in the beginning you get dumped into the game without any hook into the story i.e. you have no clue what's going on.\n\nYou can find a huge amount of different weapons and armor, each with different stats and abilities and all of them look incredibly cool! The game is also loaded with many secrets which can be uncovered like special equipment, hidden treasure chests, special Portals after defeating bosses etc.\n\nThe boss fights (i.e. the Lords) are a mix: some of them are quite easy while others are extremely hard. It takes time to learn their attack patterns and to equip yourself appropriately. Especially the final boss was a tough nut to crack. However, I have to add it never felt impossible i.e. even for the difficult fights you will manage to do a substantial amount of damage so that gives hope that it can be pulled off on a next attempt.\n\nSaving is done by means of checkpoints. So when you die you start back at a previous point and all enemies are back. Initially I didn't like this until I understood this is the core of the game: you have to redo parts in order to get more XP so you become more powerfull for the later game.\n\nWhen the game is completed you can start a new game +. This allows you to carry over all equipment of your previous playthrough. In addition it allows you to select a new school of Magic. So in this way you can eventually level up in all three schools which is quite nice.\n\nTo conclude a couple of minor points which I found:\n- There is no Quest log, so it's hard to keep track of some side Quests. Taking notes is required.\n- There is no map, so you have to have a good memory where everything is located.\n- Most of the secrets in the game are not hinted at by the in-game lore. So some you will find by chance while the rest you can only find by looking at forum posts or youtube vids. It would have been much nicer if this info could be gathered from the game itself.\n- Even after finishing the game I'm still strugging sometimes with the controls (using Controller). In most cases this is caused by the fact that sprinting, rolling and jumping is one and the same button. So more often that not when I want to sprint to perform a heavy leap attack ... my character just rolls and bounces against the enemy only to get pounded. When wanting to jump over a gap ... my character just rolls and fall in the depths. These nuisances could have been avoided by a better control sheme.\n\nMy final verdict is that it's a great game. It takes some time getting into it, but when you remain persistent (and patient) it becomes an awesome game!\n\nNote: After upgrading to Windows 10 I always got a crash when starting a new game. Disabling the NVidia Turbulence fixed this issue.","August 9, 2015","true","41.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thought that it was just a random FPS drom at first but it continued every time I was in an open area... It was pretty annoying and made the game unplayable. It also made no sense since I can run Wild Hunt on Ultra with 50-60 FPS. Almost wanted to get a refund but then decided to try and solve the problem. didn't take me very long and i found a video that solved the FPS issue for me.\n\nIf you have a nVidia GPU then check this video, it should solve the FPS problem.

R9 290x and frames still drop to below 20.\n2. Boring and tedious enemy encounters. Blind guy, guy with big axe, guy with sword and shield, headcrab thing...GO!\n3. Immutable enemy physics. Is he swinging at you? You'd better not be also swinging unless it's a killing blow! Enemies are wholly unlikely to stagger against even strong attacks, even when they're NOT attacking you!\n4. Breakables breakables breakables aka roll over ALL the things. Not a fan of this at all. You'll spend minutes at a time just rolling around the room trying to break every object possible because it MIGHT have an item. Stop it, this is not fun. Even Zelda narrowed their list of rewarding breakables.\n5. Incoherent enemy physics. Back to this again. This is EXTREMELY apparent with the First Warden (5 minutes in), enemies often exhibit motion that belies their skeletal structure. Try rolling behind an axe guy as he swings at you. Watch as he spins around on a dime mid-step and mid-swing to stay on target. The player cannot benefit from this level of precision homing.\n6. Forgettable story and characters. Right from the start, I can't seem to care about even the hero, let alone the people he encounters. Maybe part of that is the terribly awful dialogue animations. Maybe they're just poorly written. Maybe both.\n\nThis game tries very hard to be Dark Souls with a Darksiders feel. It fails at both of these things significantly.

A lot. And again. And you´re dead. Did I mention you die a lot?") you don´t seem to get the feeling you´re going to enjoy that game, then try this one. It has the same base game mechanic: you don´t win by smashing the attack buttons (like God of War), but you have to take your time to know how to approach an enemy, and make a right move when the right moment comes.\n\nThe boss fights CAN be more CHALLENGING than in Souls, because here you don´t have the option to summon help (more of this later), so you rely ONLY ON YOURSELF to beat that frightening monster, but once you learn your ways to the victory, by trying and failling (AKA: dying), it´s really great and you suddenly realize the world became a better place and you feel like going for a kitten-hug hunt   =P\n\nThe graphics are quite good, sometimes even great, and the world´s set and atmosphere feels convincing and immersive  as well as level design, but it may feel a little repetitive to some, but not for me.\n\nThe drawback is the lacking of multiplayer, both co-op and PVP. Although it´s was not a deal-breaker to me, I really could see the MP potential in this, and I hope the developers introduce MP in the future.\n\nSo, my advise is for you to ignore reviews prior to 1.4 patch, take a leap of faith and GET THIS GAME ASAP! You won´t regret!   ;-)","December 27, 2014","true","66.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","2"

My goodness, this is slow. The combat - which was clearly trying to imitate that of the Souls series - is painfully slow and difficult, and I don't mean that in a good way. The combat is passable when fighting one normal enemy at a time, but extremely tedious and frustrating when fighting more than one at once, and don't even think about fighting a boss. In the two I fought - one only just barely defeating, and this was the tutorial one - it was an agonizingly slow, tedious and frustrating experience. Every single swing is very, very slow, and don't even think about rolling, it takes several seconds, and you'll just end up getting hit. Everything feels like it's so weighed down and heavy it's almost impossible to move fluently or quickly.\n\nAnyway, away from the combat. The graphics are alright, with the environments looking quite pretty at times, and some good lighting effects. The more stylistic approach to presentation means it isn't as murky and ugly as the graphics of the Souls series. The characters look acceptable, though lip movement is below average, and not really acceptable in this day and age of gaming. Faces are a bit bland and lifeless, too.\n\nStory and characters, urgh... there isn't much. I'm aware I've only played a very limited amount of this game, but I feel no desire to continue. The story is very generic and takes itself way too seriously, with not a glimmer of humour in it. The characters spout generic and cliche fantasy dialogue that would not be considered above a B-grade fantasy novel. The Witcher, this is not.\n\nIn my 1 hour of play, I barely did anything, yet was bombared with heaps of weapons, armour and equipment, so much so that I didn't know what to do with it, what was good and what wasn't, and what I should keep, so I never changed from the generic start-off equipment I had. Balancing things out over time would have been appreciated.\n\nI'm glad I didn't buy this game for myself - even on sale - as I just played it from my friend's shared library. The combat and gameplay range from passable Souls clone to downright bad in boss fights, the graphics are fine but nothing special, and the story and characters and bland, forgettable and generic.

And in some ways it's similar. It does have the same weighty combat system, where you have to commit to each and every one of your attacks, that have lengthy animations and can not be interrupted mid-swing by the player; hits received, however, will stop your attack. You need to know the attack patterns of all enemies you encounter to survive in the first half of the game, looking for opportunities to strike without losing precious HP.\n\nHP in this game can be restored in 3 ways - by a trinket called Life Leech that I personally only got in the later part of the game, that gives you HP for every monster you kill; by casting a Prayer spell, that acts as a decoy for your enemies and also regenerates a little bit of your health; and, most efficiently, by drinking health potions. Your supply of potions is limited and can only be restored by using a Shard - a checkpoint, essentially - or by dying.\n\nThis works really well with another system in place - the XP modifier. The more monsters you kill without using a checkpoint or dying, the more XP you get for each consequent kill, up to 2.0 times more XP for kill. This is very handy, but forces you to refrain from healing and restocking at checkpoints for longer and longer. The game's progress still can be saved at a checkpoint without losing the modifier, but that will not restock your potions and health. It is also said that the more XP you have "banked" - kept unspent with a risk of losing it - the better loot you can get.\n\nThis all makes for a thrilling experience, where your stakes are high, and combat feels important, as every monster you meet has a good chance of killing you.\nThat said, the feeling only lasts throughtout the first half of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, as you grow stronger, especially if you min-max the ♥♥♥♥ out of your character the way I did it, the fights get easier and easier. In the beginning bossfights took tries and tries to win, and even ordinary monsters had me respawning time after time. By the time I entered the Rhogar Realm for the first time, after, apparently before my time, killing the Rhogar Lord the Champion (I've killed him 4th, later discovering that he should've been the 5th boss to die), I felt immensely powerful. I still could be killed, don't get me wrong, and I died quite a few times when I goofed up, but most of the fights came to "Bash-Leap-Dodge-Repeat", with some enemies often dying from one heavy attack after being bashed in the face with a Tower Shield.\n\nBoss fights, while each having their own mechanics and even bonus difficulty conditions rewarded with special loot, got easier. 5th and 6th bosses I've met I've killed in 2 minutes and 50 seconds respectively. Last two bosses took me two tries each, in contrast with the 3rd boss that took 6.\n\nThe game also feels short. It took me 14 hours to beat it for the first time, and the ending certainly feels a bit abrupt, and not much is explained to you, definitely setting the players up for a sequel.\n\nOverall, Lords of the Fallen has very solid mechanics, absolitely GORGEOUS look to it, wonderful aesthetic and atmosphere, but feels like the developers ran out of steam in the second half of the game, quickly wrapping it up with whatever good ideas they still had. It's a great experience, yet short, and it definitely could use some more difficulty in the end.","December 29, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Not going to be a long review that way people looking to buy can skim through the mixed reviews. First off this game is fun, don't get me wrong, the main mechanics behind the game are good. The optimization is meh, the art style is good, and the gameplay is decent.\nWhere the game really fails is it's enemy design and how to counter these enemies. The game doesn't give you a choice on how to do something. For example early on in the game there's a shield enemy that can one or two shot you easily, break through your shield, and is IMPOSSIBLE to get around, the only way to kill him is to blast him with magic, there's no other way. The game itself is good but the bosses and enemies are too generic, the game needs artifical difficulty, not diffuculty that's going to ram you in the ♥♥♥.

I got it on bundlestars I think pretty cheap.\n\nA game having so many negative reviews usually pushes it down the list a bit. I gave it a go and it was okay but not great, but sometimes you have to stick at it and not get frustrated and by the time I got to the first boss I was really getting into it.\n\nWhat I've learnt is that the standard warrior tank class sucks because it's slow and boring to play. For my second game I rolled a rogue and the game was suddenly so much better. It's a much faster and slicker way to play the game. Also you need to get as much xp as possible gathered up early on as it makes things a little easier especially as a rogue. You are going to need play it for a while to settle in then start again when you know what you're doing so you have less chance of dying so you can build xp up.\n\nSome say this game is like Dark Souls and some say not. After completing Dark Souls 3 I think they are the same type of game and I would make comparisons between the two. I didnt really play Dark Souls 1 & 2 so much though.\n\nI feel a bit for the devs of this game with all negativity surrounding it because it's actually very good and very well done.\n\nAnyway, in my opinion this game is definitely worth playing. The graphics are great, the fights are satisfying, the enimies have a great look and design, there is plenty to do and the boss fights are good.\n\nTo improve things I'd like to see things explained a bit better like a training mode or something that goes a bit deeper than the tutorial at the very start. Also, another couple of classes to choose from would be great as I honestly think the fun drops drastically playing anything other than the rogue.","April 12","true","34.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not gonna lie... this game is very difficult... especially for people like me who have never played any of the Dark Souls games... However it CAN be done... It takes patience... lots and lots of patience! The combat system is quite elegant in its own right, a very well thought out and complex system where weight of armour slows you down, weight of the weapon and whether or not you are yet strong enough to be able to swing it with one hand while holding a shield in the other... Stamina every swing,  block, parry and riposte costs you stamina... As well as agility, faith and whatnot.\n\nYou cannot simply just run in to a group of Rhogar (the bad guys) and expect to win... Not even on easy difficulty setting. All the Lords and their warriors (although can eventually be slain with pure brute force), require different techniques into bringing them down... some techniques may take you a minute to learn, some may even take you 2 hours to learn... There has been times I have wanted to fist my monitor and throw my keyboard through the study window.\n\nThe graphics on Ultra setting are quite beautiful, the artwork is fantastic, Dark and Gothic environments with enemies that look like they have come straight from the lower depths of hell... The art team should be pleased with their work... although the cut scenes were a little on the crappy side. The soundtrack is awesome... dark music that helps you immerse into your environment and sets the mood. The story line is a little lacking not plot wise but it's just missing something.\n\nThe inventory and upgrading systems are very easy to deal with... you don't need to be some sort of mathematician to work it out...\n\nOverall... I give this game an 8/10... it loses two points because:\n\n1 - The easy difficulty setting should be way more easier than what it is... for new comers it should be much more forgiving because some people (like me) enjoy playing games at a consistent pace first and then increase the difficulty when we play again... But hey No big deal... just practice practice practice!!\n\n2 - The story and cutscenes were a little lacking, but it wasn't too bad...\n\n3 - Would like to be able to jump without rolling when landing... A few little spots to navigate which proved more difficult then they should have...\n\n4 - A map in the menu screen would have been sensational... just coz sometimes I like to know where I'm going (especially the catacombs :/ )","December 3, 2014","true","22.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When your character swings the greataxe you can just tell its a huge big piece of metal. I love it because in most games your character swings giant swords like a paper mache toys.\n-Enemy design and especially the bosses are great.\n-Dark Souls like mechanics with "souls", "bonfires" - I don't see nothing wrong with more games trying to do that.\n-Bosses changes their tactics with every life bar took down- pretty interesting, an you really have to study and learn their move sets.\n\nNow the bad:\n-Levels are pretty much linear, and there is some backtracking. Also most of the locations looks pretty much the same. It lacks variety unlike DS games.\n-Enemy AI feels rushed and unpolished - those guys will just glue their faces in to your direction and the fight turns into the circling fest. It gets boring fast.\n-I just couldn't immerse myself into the story and I didn't care for the main character, the guy is just... meh... just a generic angry "badass".\n-Also it was one of the worst game launches I have ever experienced - most issues are gone now, however bad taste stays.\n\nGame could be sooo much better with more open world and better AI, it was clearly made by people that likes video games like DS and tried to combine their favorites mechanics into Lords.\nAlso its a shame that they made us to play as a pre-made guy - in games like this I prefer to be able to make my own character. Especially in this case when Harkin is just plain boring.\n\nIt lands somewhere between recommended and not - if on sale - sure you will pump some fun out of this title. For a full price, sorry but no - it had a fantastic potential, but did not made it.","October 20, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It feels like you are in an mmo raid instance and keep wiping on trash mobs over and over. Like no matter how much gear you get, you're constantly way undergeared for the place you are in, and it would be nice to have an option tone that down slightly. Most opponenets have a distinct weakness that you have to find on your own, and until you do you'll probably die several times. Quest objectives are very vague.\n\nAll that said, the combat is good and I like the idea of fighting only one or two enemies at a time, instead of a swarm. It gives combat a layer of depth and skill and timing that other games can't have. I'd like to see this concept implemented in other games now that engines support complex blocking mechanics.\n\n3.5/5","December 12, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So each point, is written in real time, as i was experiencing the positives, and negatives..  You'll note that my opinions change over the course.. Its not Souls, but a great attempt!\n\n-Its beautiful. The graphics, environment, characters, weapons/armors. Top notch quality! It claims the enemies have the same rules you do.. Stagger, weight, momentum, etc.. This is blatantly false, and you will notice it in the prologue (this was my biggest issue with the game overall).\n\nSlow swings i can deal with, but the 1h Maces' terrible reach, & overly slow windup (even your "fast" attack) is painful.. I opted for medium armored Cleric, with the hammer, and shield & Red Magic.. I dropped the hammer asap, and i LOVE hammers! The 1st boss was almost the end of the game for me, as it told you how to swing, dodge, and then puts you up at a boss fight almost immediately.. Frusteration, is not fun for me, nor is trial and error.. Ive beaten all 3 souls games multiple times, and thoroughly enjoyed those.. Never was Frusteration part of it.. It always felt like player error when i lost.. This is alot of fighting the mechanics, and stick and move.. Ill bet 9/10 player will opt to play the heavily armored tank, and trade blows, as it feels like the only way to play..\n\nBut its pretty, if your rig can handle it.. The trash mobs are too weak, and the bosses are not fun.. The only redeeming factor, besides the graphics, are all the armor/weapons... WHich is useless, if the game isnt fun to play!\n\n(some of my opinions here changed as i progressed)\n\n*****UPDATE*****\nPlayed several more levels, and hours, beat 3 or 4 bosses accross 2 different classes.. 1 the medium/heavy armored Cleric with very slow weapons (much harder to progress), the 2nd light armored dual wield/staff Rogue (much easier with the fast weapons)  As i said above, the game tries to claim that enemies abide by the same rules that govern the player, and its just not true.. They can attack you while youre in the middle of a flurry, but a little jab stops and staggers your combo.. Unless you have high poise, and heavy armor, even blocking will stagger slightly. The only weapons i was able to stagger enmies with, were maces/hammers.. Unfortunately, they are so insanely slow, and with terrible reach, landing an attack is rage endusing! Theres no closing steps, or any type of way to close a gap, short of tapping forward, and heavy attack to do the lunging attack. Enemies are always able to track your rolls (especially bosses), and can and will land an attack that should have landed far behind you. This rule does not apply to the player.(staggering is helped with AP)\n\nBasically, everything staggers, stuns, slows, or interupts the player, but very few things hold true for enemies.. They also do not appear to have  a stamina bar, of any sort. While you will struggle early on, to get anything more than a 2 shot, MAYBE 3x combo, enemies can pound away. Even with a Greatshield and Greatsword.\n\nSound cuts out, as do the little collectible audio logs. Some will not play at all..\n\nBecause the main attack, and block buttons are the bumpers on a 360 controller, often times your actions will not respond.. Lets face it, those buttons are garbage, and break 1st on the controller. They suck.. And because they do, the gameplay suffers.\n\nI wanna say, i have fun when all is working well.. But its definitely a B class Souls game.. Im torn.. Some may like it, others wont.. It will help to not compare it to Souls.. I trying, but its an obvious clone, and difficult to ignore.\n\n-Update-\nIm now playing as my 3rd different class.. Most of the enemies feel like 1 trick ponies.. Meaning, they have only 1 way to be beaten.. So if you have a preferred way of play, youll be swapping it alot.. Changing weapons for their preferred enemy.. The fast weapons still hold top slot for most! The bosses, have all felt the same (as far as ive been to my 5th boss).\n\nMagic (if you can call it that) is exactly the same 4 spells for all 3 styles, with different names.. And they are really short buff times, and long cast times.. So theres no 'magic class'.. Which could be a good thing, since Souls felt like easy mode for a caster.. Having played as many, i feel confident saying its much, MUCH easier to play as a caster for 99/100 bosses accross the series! But, the options is nice..Atleast its there.....\n\nThe camera.. Oh god this camera is awful!  Nearing a wall, or being knocked over puts the camera behind you as such, that Harkyn becomes invisible, so you dont know if he has stood back up or not.. Spamming dodge until he stands is the best way to know, else waiting until the enemy goes into his combo! I find far too many situations, where my camera has screwed me! The large bosses is another..\n\nLock-on, doesnt function in high tense situations, and only seems to work when you have a clear LoS, and are not trying desperately in the fray to lock on to a target as hes circling you (or you, him). Trying to fight without lockon, unlike Souls', is abysmal! (Lock on at start of combat, or regret it)\n\nYou'll notice that some of the enemies wont allow dmg to be inflicted when you knock them down..As theyre laying on their back. This rule also, does not apply to you. (so many rules do not)\n-Minor Spoiler-\nBossfight with "Beast" was the worst yet.. The camera was constantly blocked off by the animal, and could never see what was going on.. The yellow bar thats supposed to empty for you to stagger him, didnt work AT ALL! It would drain randomly, and i mean COMPLETELY random! Sometimes i would take half ot if in a single hit, but then nothing else would lower it.. But it would chip away his hp instead? Other times, it would actually FILL IT UP!? It made no sense.. I thought maybe only can use either light, or heavy attacks,, Nope.. Made no difference.. I was only ever able to lowerr his yellow stagger bar on the initial hit, then some random attack would finally empty it.. I basically had to face tank that entire fight.. Tactics didnt work.. Sometimes when i finally did get him staggered, his head would fall outside the boundaries, rendering it out of reach of attacks.. The Dodge/hit registry was also horribly off on this boss, as you had to roll long before he ever started swinging.. His legs appear to be open, so you should walk between to get behind him, but this is folly.. Its an invisible wall, and you must roll under him entirely, or walk around him.. Very poorly implemented! Hits only register on the back of his legs,not the front.\n\n---Final Update---\n*After a few dozen hours in this game, and several different character archetypes, and Magics, i feel as though i am having fun (When everything is working). I use the term "working" loosely, as im not referring to technical issues (ive only had 2 crashes, 1 of which only happened after 30+hours) Its fun.. All of my previous points hold true still, but you learn to work with/around them while playing.. I love the over exaggerated armors/weapons, and beautiful artstyle of the graphics. The heavy combat, and challenging style is great.. My wish, is that this game has a sequel, with the issues get fixed.. (And a longer game, it is very short).\n\nI still cannot recommend this game at full retail price, but at something like $30.00 brand new i could get onboard with.. I got it on sale for $9.99 during the Christmas sale, and feel like i got more than my money worth! So if its on sale, and your a fan of the Souls series, its definitely a must have, but ONLY on sale..","December 31, 2015","true","53.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

AND NEVER BUY THIS GAME WITHOUT A DECENT STEAM DISCOUNT!\nPROS :\n-good graphics. waay better than the souls games ( other than bloodborne ofc),\n- Great melee combat, more realistic version of souls melee. with actual weight behind attacks\n-  great character design\n-well designed levels\n-Great armor and weapon design\nCONS :\n-WORTHLESS NEW game +!!!! AND THIS IS THE WORST OFFENCE. ONLY 1 new armor set in new game + Just ONE! ( if you guys find more equipment pls tell me. I for one cant find any )\n-no gameplay outside of the main story.  No exploration.\n-Flavour text makes no sense, I got a legendary sword that gets stronger with each kill and a weapon from another world.... both of them deals half as much damage as the weapon you get from frkn palace guards in the late game that in the lore , couldnt even kill 1 rhogar lord! but they wield weapons 3 times stronger!!! WTF\n-SPOILER !!! ......A certain point in the game sets it up so that you get to choose sides, but you actualy dont!  Near the end of the game you find out that your true enemy is someone else from the "god" you are supposed to kill. and instead of being given the choice whether to belive him or not harken belives him just like that! and procedes to fight against the entire human army! How does he know that the ghostly figure of his dead friend is not an illusion?\n-Plot is barely explained. as detailed by my rant below\n-World map size is small not even half of dark souls 1\n- game length is short. I only got to 20 hours because I forced myself to get the secret weapons of the bosses. which by the way are all useless as they rarely deal more damage than the weapons you get before facing them.\n- skills are there but barely needed for actual combat. I went warior but never and I mean NEVER needed to use my skills other than for solving an ocational puzzle. I got them just for the sake of being able to enjoy the warior class but I could and normaly dont use them anyway. they could have given skills more importance or impact in the game.\n-weapons and armor are recolored and reused. at first you Apreciate the good looks of equipment. then you realize that the late game version is a recolored version of that same armor. hell even the kinks and scratches are in the same place! WTF\n\nLong Rant version :\n-Bought the game on sale and went in knowing that it is a  subpar dark souls. and despite that I enjoyed the game, that is untill I got to new game + Frgn new game plus barely has anything + about it. only I found only 1 new armor set! WTF Kind of new game + is that? Oh and the story is even more vague than Dark Souls. Why is Harken a prissoner? What the hell was the opening scene about?  What was the hammer that he got in the opening cutscene? Why did the final boss turn into that? And the world map is barely as big as half of the Dark souls original map. Probablt only as big as Anor Londo + sens fortress + Seaths  castle. And though the armors in the game do look cool the problem with them is that the late game armor is nothing more than a recolored version of earlier armor pieces. And the item descriptions are fckn dissapointing. You get a legendary weapon of some sort that has half the damage of the weapons you get from the palace soldiers late in the game? wtf .\n","December 9, 2015","false","20.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However,t he company just did not finish their product. The game itself has performance issues. No matter how low I turned the graphics down, the game had long loading times and would slide show occasionally. Putting it in borderless window mode helped this, but not completely. The also randomly crashes. Not frequent enough to be a huge issue, but enough to be annoying.\n\nFurthermroe, the game not only refuses to hold your hand but flat out doesn't give any direction what so ever. I loved the souls series for their lack of hand holding, but i always coudl tell whether Iw as goign the right way or not and generally understood the direction I was heading. LotF felt like I was constantly stumbling around. So many times I'm just trying to find the right way and no sure if I'm even int he right area then bam boss fight out of no where. I can't count the amount of times I just sat there a moment wondering where I was.\n\nThen there's the stat system which didn't make any sense no matter how you cut it.

WARNING:  I swear frequently.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8q_tSOD2ow&list=PLklrkLw7j3VTq02g1ZnLXgD9oh1Ao5Qsw&index=1\n\nI'll preface this by saying that I'm a huge Dark Souls fan.  However, I'm extremely critical of all games that I play, including those dear to my heart like the Souls series.  All of my experiences playing this game are as a lightly armoured Rogue.  Apparently, the game is much different (easier) for heavily armoured Warriors, but I lack the experience to comment on that.  Scroll to the very bottom for the TLDR-style conclusion.\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis game is the only one in several years to crash on me.  My PC should be able to handle it without a hitch on High, maybe even Ultra settings, yet I was forced to turn off all the extra effects and go Medium just to make it playable.\n\nI don't remember anything about the soundtrack.  Voice acting is stiff, but sometimes to comical effect.\n\nThe story is dull, the characters are forgettable and the writing is flat out bad.  I for one can actually appreciate the comedic potential of bad writing, but most people won't be so forgiving.  The majority of the story is told through collecting Audio Logs.  This is a nice touch, as it lets you understand the setting while you continue exploring.\n\nCombat is... all over the place.  Sometimes combat is fluid and makes sense.  Other times enemies will immediately counterattack and stun you without an animation, making you sit through free damage.  Many enemies have giant shields, and just like in a Souls game, they're extremely monotonous to fight.\n\nThe pacing of combat is very slow compared to either Souls game, where your fast roll feels like something between a medium and fat roll from DS1.  I wouldn't say the change in pace is a good or bad thing, just different, and Souls vets will definitely take time to adjust.\n\nBoss fights drag on with huge health bars and little variance in attacks, making them a chore after the first few moments.  They do, however, use a 'phase' system similar to bosses in MMOs, which can make the fights more interesting.\n\nThe game uses a combo system that encourages you to chain attacks together for increased damage and poise breaking.  This sounds great on paper, but in practice, you'll rarely be given an opportunity to use them because...\n\n...poise is an absolute mess in this game.  When staggered, enemies will often break out of the stun to continue attacking you, which defies any sense of game logic.\n\nI didn't use magic to comment, but the gauntlet - a ranged magic weapon - feels extremely forced into the game, as if it was something for the devs to tick off their checklist.  Same thing with destructable items.\n\nWhile the graphics are very good and well detailed, the game world is tiny and forces you to backtrack so much that one can only assume there were budget restraints.  The game tries to emulate the joy of Souls shortcuts, but for every one that makes sense, there are ten that don't... or ask you to come back much later in the game.  On foot.\n\nThere's really not much selection in weapon types, especially considering you'll be locked to your stat of choice.  Agility, for example, has daggers, shortswords and staves, along with one axe that feels slow and heavy like a Strength weapon.  You can socket items similar to Diablo games, but in similar fashion you'll be using the exact same gems every time to min/max.\n\nFinally, let's talk about bugs.  Crashes.  Animations being skipped.  Enemies standing still and attacking you from bizarre angles.  Invisible enemies.  Frequently absurd hitboxes.  And yes... this game has almost been out for a year.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLords of the Fallen is a shorter, buggier and often nonsensical version of Dark Souls 2 but with superior graphics and an art style reminiscent of Warhammer.  While I wouldn't call it a terrible game and did enjoy my playthrough at least somewhat, there's a lot of barriers blocking the way for 'fun'.  Impatient players and Souls players in particular will be rubbed the wrong way by this game.  I cannot recommend this game in good faith simply because you can buy Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin for the same price, a game that is superior in almost every way.  Only consider this game if you can get it at a very reduced price and are prepared to muscle through bugs and poor optimization.  What I will say, however, is that it's very important that this game exists, because it shows that companies other than From are willing to take a shot at Souls-likes.  Let's hope the next attempt is a better one.","August 12, 2015","false","27.0"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","14","29","2","0"

Visually it's beautiful but that really is its biggest plus, along with some good voice acting. On the downside it has performance issues, including an almost constant micro stutter and some rather large frame rate drops in parts, as well as full on crashes for some users. The camera is another big problem, I died a few times because I completely lost sight of the enemy while using the lock on feature which is really poorly implemented, you will often lose your target entirely and for some reason the game will pick a target on the other side of the room instead of the mob right next to, switching locked targets is also cumbersome, it's not a simple flick of the right stick that we're all used to by now. The gameplay itself is what I'd call "clunky", and not just because it's very slow (which it is), but because it just feels very unrefined. A big part of these types of games are the boss fights and once again Lords of the Fallen falls short, every boss has a very simple gimmick/mechanic and once you know it the fight just becomes a war of attrition as all bosses have very high HP so I found the fights tended to drag on which made them feel less epic and more tedious.\n\nOverall I can't recommend it, I had the game on my wishlist for over a year so thought why not when it was on sale but it really wasn't very good at all.\n\n5/10\n\nReviewed on: i5 3570k @ 4.4GHz, GTX 970 @ 1373Mhz/1938Mhz, 8GB DDR3 @ 1600MHz, Samsung Evo 850 SSD, Window 10 64bit","May 4","false","15.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

The Atmosphere seems nice, the graphics seem gorgeous too! One of the bigger problems is getting this game to run, after multiple crashes and other probelms such as never ending spinning camera, you might finally managed to get this game to work without any problems (until the next start up).\n\nTo the Actual Game, you get only 3 different classes with 3 different armor sets. Every Character seems to have an ultra heavy weapon that he can't swing proper, which means you have to time against your own reaction times and might react 30 seconds before the enemy puts its shield up. Whilst this is not a big problem against small enemies, it its an awfully big problem against Bosses & Bigger Enemys. A Dodge funktion and/or attack funktion should work immediatly and not half a minute after its being pressedn, which means you get hit 99.9% of the time.\n\nIf you are searching for a game like this only with better optimazation and fair gameplay than I would recommend you to go and play Dark Souls Prepare to die Edition (+free mod support) as it is the best one they ever made so far.

It has the weighty, punishing combat but manages to not feel cheap. You're punished for making mistakes, but rarely killed outright, giving you some time to learn enemies' patterns. There are usually checkpoints a short distance before boss fights, so you don't have to spend hours upon hours just fighting your way back to them only to be killed again in 3 seconds. Speaking of bosses, I was able to explore and find a boss that seemed way too hard for my current level - I could barely scratch him. Satisfyingly, with some persistence and a total change of strategy, I wore him down in an epic, edge of seat, half-hour long battle and won the day.\n\nMy (fairly minor) gripes so far are a slight lack of enemy variety and that the spells seem a bit limited and shoehorned in.","December 24, 2014","true","7.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Also, it lacks on variety of enemies, but at least there are a lot of weapons and armors, which all look cool.

Example: Fat enemy with crossbow/traps/fire grenades with 1 inch long legs moves faster and hits harder in melee than your ironclad knight character. He also seems to have no problem leaping 20 meters back the moment you start to swing your weapon (which takes 5 hours to complete). He can also do this consecutively without getting tired. Ever. And then he smashes your face in while you're recovering. Twice.\n- Backstabbing mechanic is clunky and rarely works when it should.\n- Objectives are unclear.\n- You have no idea where you need to go (mapping isn't done well).\n- You can't distinguish anything, everything looks too similar, too much of the same debris everywhere.\n- Side quests are vague and simply badly designed.\n- Voice acting seems robotic. Pre-recorded text and slapped here and there, no 'emotion' or 'reactive' dialogue whatsoever.\n- Characters are bland and one dimensional.\n- Skills are uninspiring.\n- Casting skills takes a ridiculous amount of time.\n- Casting a skill and getting hit during bugs things out. You sometimes get the benefit of the skill without triggering it's Cooldown or using Mana. Unintended bug, but is actually really useful for the player when it happens.\n- Fighting the simplest enemy can take 5 minutes because of the way combat is designed.\n- Company intro cinematics take a very long time.\n- In fact, everything takes a ridiculous amount of time.\n- Company intro cinematics cannot be skipped nor disabled.\n- Weapons / gear seem bland. They feel very similar to eachother, no real variety.\n- Difficulty curve is all over the place. Sometimes you get roflstomped by the simplest mobs, but the boss's heaviest attack does only 10 damage against you.\nAbout the controller:\n- Cannot disable controller vibration.\n- Control schemes are unintuitive.\n- Cannot set your own control scheme, and there are only 2 to choose from.\n- Made me spent my time to write a negative review.\n\nOn to the good things:\n+ Looks quite good graphically.\n+ Another contestor for Souls like gameplay.\n+ Greatly displays how much Dark Souls could have sucked, but didn't.\n+ Makes you appreciate the Souls series even more.\n+ They tried.\nDid they?

In Lords of the Fallen, all, and I do mean ALL of the combat is based off of timing. This means that combat moves pretty slow and feels clunky and one tries to position the enemy into just the right spot and then waits to swing the weapon. Weapons are fairly heavy in this game and so they take a good amount of time to swing, which means one has to mentaly calculate how long it is going to take you to swing your weapon, how long your enemy is going to take to swing his, and then determine the window of oppertunity. This leads to an awkward period in which on is trying to judge all of these things...in really slow time since the weapons are heavy. I know other games do similar things to this, but once agian the apparent weight of the weapons makes this feel like it is going on forever.\n\n2) The second big issue for me was the weapon leveling system (and really the whole leveling system in general). The only way to improve a weapon in this game is to add a ruin to it, and hope that the weapon you want to add the ruin to is one that you can add a ruin to. See why this is annoying yet? What makes it worse is that the ruins only add special effects, and don't really do much to the damamge base damage of the weapon. My problem with this, other than it being anoying, is that it doesn't really allow you any good or even decent way to grind, work, or attempt to make personal approvements to gear up for a boss or tough enemy. The leveling system doesn't help either as the complex load out and multitude of essentialy useless options means there are plenty of places to put skill points but very few that seem to help.\n\n3) The story. Its just bland and at times can be a bit hard to follow. I know I didn't get terrebly far into the game, but after three bosses, you would think one would at least have a vegue idea as to why one is trying to fight these bosses. Or at least why one fought the bosses I did fight. I watched the cut scenes and all I know is that nobody likes monks and demons are bad. The story just bores me.\n\nDespite the beauty and great graphics of this game I just can't recomend it. I should also not that I never experianced any of the technical issues many other users have, but I'm using an MSI GT72 Dominator Pro so...that may be something to think about. Anyway, I just don't think its worth the hassle.","December 12, 2015","false","9.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

You probably see where I'm getting at, the game is a pretty and somewhat polished collection of clichés  with an emphasis on 1 on 1 (maximum 1 on 3) sword/axe/hammer/etc fight and some magic.\n\nThe game is similar to the Dark Souls series, with an emphasis on combat and loss of experience in case if you die (no quick saves here).

It's challenging, it's insanely pretty and it feels good...\n\n...if it runs for more than 20 minutes without crashing.\n\n\nI've got a rather high-end system. No current game on ultra settings makes my computer break a sweat, yet Lords of the Fallen significally drops in FPS upon knocking it up to ultra. However, that'd be okay, I can live with HIGH settings, it still looks great, however what ultimately kills any enjoyment one might have from the title is the fact that it crashes constantly and without any recognizeable pattern. Sometimes it crashes mid-fight. Sometimes it crashes upon dying or respawning. Sometimes it crashes when entering a door. Sometimes it crashes after 5 minutes, sometimes after 20, but never later. And I'm not the only one with issues like this. Check the forums. Check the community hub or other sites.\n\nCountless people report similar problems, and have reported them since launch, however the Devs have yet to fix the issue. Whether that is through lazyness or incompetence I don't know, but the fact stands that if you buy this game, you're wagering your money on whether or not you may be able to actually play it, as there is no demo available with which you could see if your system is one of the few random ones that can run the game without issues.\n\nIf the crashes were fixed, I would immediately recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Dark Souls, or who simply enjoys a bit of spice in their RPGs.

Almost a dark souls ripoff with diffrent controls and better graphics (thank god there is an option to change controls scheme to "almost darksoulslike something"). Im not saying that this game is bad. I kinda liked it at first. But the bosses are more like "figure out how to even hurt him and spend 10-20 minutes just fighting him because he has a sick amount of health" than use skill, timing and dodging to kill him fast. The first bossfight (The Commander) was extremely generic, boring and took so long that i kept losing focus after some time. I might sound like scrublord casul but man i ♥♥♥♥ you not, as a veteran who completed both dark souls and dark souls 2 multiple times and loved both games i hated this game for its first boss who killed me alot of times just because this fight took so damn long. It wasn't hard. But it was enough for me to dislike this game. After beating him i easily cut through the army of repeating 5 enemy types and got to the second boss. And i think that this boss is more of a riddle then actual bossfight and you need to figure out how to beat him. But he always one shotted me with almost every attack ;_; Wanted to start the game again from the scratch with a diffrent class but then i remembered the first bossfight. *cries in a corner* Someday i will complete this game. I want to complete it. But for now i think that i cannot recommend  it because of the first bossfight. This game might be great for the begginers in the darksoulslike games (i think this becomes a new game genre) but for a veteran its just uncomfortable and weird to play this game. Its similiar to dark souls but very diffrent at once.","September 8, 2015","false","6.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","3"

My computer freezed and restarted a few times because I had <6GB VRAM and I was using the "very high textures" or whatever was that that required 6GB. Then I degraded the graphics until they were under what my computer can handle just to be sure it will work. It worked... for a while. Because I tried loading the game and it froze my computer again. I don't want to blame the game but I have pretty good hardware. Maybe it's just me.\nThe game as it is is good. Not exceptional, not very good. Just good. It has the right amount of fun a good game needs. But it's not much more than that.\nAs for it's comparison to the Souls series, it tries to be a souls game in it's own way. It encourages the player to be a little more aggresive, but to keep in mind that he can be killed if he isn't careful.\nI think if you get this game cheap (you can buy it for ~5$ from some sites) it's worth it.\nI wish I could enjoy it without the fear that my hardware will just fail while playing.","May 7","false","5.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

The first thing I noticed is how well polished it is. The controls feel smooth and the UI is very intuitive. I so wanted to get into Dark souls 2, but I just couldn't. This game takes a lot from Dark Souls and, imo, does it better. It's beautiful and can be brutally challenging at times. Unlike Dark Souls, the controls for mouse and keyboard work well. I tried both a controller and M+k and I personally prefer M+K better. The sounds are well done and help to create an immersive experience. All in all I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging and rewarding experience.","December 24, 2014","true","12.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If you were planning to buy this, I do recommend it, but not for the current price. It may be more worthwhile for about €15.00.\n\nI'm recommending it as a "no", not because I think it's worthy of a no, but because it is not worthy of a yes. This game does a lot of things wrong in my eyes, and is not all that interesting. I find the story and controls difficult to grasp. and the tutorials are awfully average. The enemy positioning and aggro ranges are odd and the "stealth" system is silly. The game doesn't hold you by the hand, and as result ends up explaining a lot of elements very, very poorly.\n\nBut in the end I am still not having a bad time - just not a great one either. There are a few comical elements to this game and it doesn't feel particularily bad to walk around in cool armour. But that seems to be the key selling point of the game - that everything looks cool.\n\nI can't add much to the story yet, but it doesn't seem all that impressive either.\n\nWith the footage that I have seen, the playtime that I've put into this game, and the research I have done, I am fairly confident in my judgment that this game (for now) is better left in the shelves until it gets seriously cheaper.\n\nIn the end, you may have more fun watching someone else play through this than play through it yourself. I definitely recommend you do research when you are considering buying this game, and if you do, buy it on a discount.","December 24, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Keep looking this game is not for you.\n\n\nThis game is not for anyone. It's not that it's too easy,  or nothing but a souls clone because it does add to the souls formula in good ways (I like the faith/magic system for example). The biggest, most glaring problem is the enemy design and boss design. The first boss is okay - not much too him but he's the first boss so w/e. The second boss is where you see the problem: f****ing shields. The entire fight is walking around him until he decides to do something because blocking negates 99.9% of all your damage. Who the hell thought this was a good boss design!? You wait. And then you deal about 1/15th his health, then wait some more. Then kill some adds, and repeat. It's embarrassingly bad.\n\nI killed him twice because the first time the damn game crashed on me during the cutscene and there's no autosave. I figured if this was the worst there was that's okay, I'll keep playing. OH BUT THEN. MORE. F***KING. SHIELDS. I do not feel like spending 5 minutes circling shield enemies waiting for a small opening to deal a small amount of damage to. This is BAD DESIGN.\n\nDon't buy it. Don't consider it.

Moreover, movement would be easier as the enemies seem to have a huge attack hit-box that can swing at almost 360 degrees.\n\nI was drawn into this game due to the combat style where, like Dark Souls, it was a little more than mere button mashing to knock out your opponent (see Skyrim).  And coming from Vaatividya's video I saw it could be an enjoyable game. However, I found this game to be quite unplayable.\n\nOne major flaw when I first played this game was that it eats up so much memory and froze often. Annoyance is an understatement as I had cleared the first boss and a bit of the area thereafter, but had to restart the game only to find all my progress had been lost. Subsequent attempts at beating the boss again reinforces the name: "Clunky Souls" where I found fighting the game mechanics more so than the actual enemies.\n\nBut speaking of enemies, the ones with the greatshield are the worst, including the bosses. Their numerous attacks leave you with little stamina after dodging to get behind them and get even a single hit in. They hit hard, have ridiculous defence and are difficult to punish. Of course, baiting the right attack to land the backstab is possible, but it's very tedious just going round in circles.\n\nMy lack of gameplay time has been due to frustration with the game's performance and unresponsive combat. While it's flattering for it to be compared to Dark Souls, in my opinion, it's just more of a comparison of how Dark Souls does it much better. I really wanted to like this game because I wanted the sophisticated combat, but unfortunately it fails to give me another Dark Souls experience.\n\nEDIT no. 3: my opinion on this game keeps changing. While it can be enjoyable to an extent of exploration and combat, the enemy designs are terrible. For one thing, once they hit you, it's nigh on impossible to avoid their follow-up combo, draining both health and stamina if you were blocking, already making counter-attacks unlikely. And the second is that so far there are only a few enemy types in the game. They are introduced gradually but from what I've seen there are only about six basic types whose health and damage spike without warning.","September 2, 2015","false","7.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I bought the game for 10 euros and I still regret it. If it were running smooth I may have wanted to go on and play the whole game....but the framerate problems (luckily, no crashes) + extremely boring maps (it looks always the same....Dark Souls has a magic feeling whenever you enter a new location) and so - so fights make me want to just quit the game and not go back to it.","October 25, 2015","false","5.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It is kind of like Dark Souls, but not really, which is not exactly a bad thing. It is not like Dragon Age at all which is a bit of a dissapointment. And it is not like Kingdoms of Amalur either, even though I have heard it compariered to all three. However, this is one of the most boring, monotonus, and overrated games I have seen in years. And here are three reasons as to why.\n\n1 The Basics: gameplay, graphics, mechanics ect.\n\nFor starters, it is a hack and slash job, meaning that the gameplay is going to be a johnny one note eventually once you hit a stride. This is not always that bad, Dragon Age could be argued as a hack and slash but it is so good that it over comes that querk. What lets this down for me on that end is the way you fight. Once you figure it out, combat is down to this formula, block, stab, dodge, counter attack, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and Zzzz, Zzzz. There is not other truely effective tactic regardless of class used, not that the classes are all that different mind you. It will not matter which you choose, I will get into this later but it is quite bland. To make things worse, you cannot choose what your character will look like so you are stuck with one ugly SOB with a shaved head, bad beard, and stupid tattoos all over his face. Give up any asperations of running for government office. Not that you ever see it that much, the camera control is pretty much locked up to you rear end both in and out of combat, the only time you can ever see what you look like is in conversation, which is only marginaly better than the one found in Kingdoms of Amalur. Not that this matters either because the graphics are a big let down for a title of this price and rating, and this only came out a little over a year back.\n\n2 There is no F***ing castor class!!!!!!!!\n\nIn Dragon Age, I prefer mage, Mass Effect, Sheperd is a Sentinel, and I go full Battlemage in Kingdoms. Three guesses which class I like, hint it sure as little green apples ain't here. The class system here is a little confusing, you begin by choosing three "magics" that have nothing to do with magic in any respect with the exaption of prayer, maybe. Next you choose which of three weapon and armor types that leave you in the same place, heavy armor, big weapons, and no finesse. In total, there are nine classes that can be chosen, first time I went out I came up with Ranger,the second, Paladin, third, Brawler. All three felt exactly the same, no kidding, the exact same gameplay, I gave up on each just a few minutes in due to sheer bordom. If you are like me, avoid at all costs.\n\n3 This kind of thing has been done to death, ressurcted, and done to death again.\n\nBig picture, massive evil army of death dealing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out to kill everything in sight. Dark Spawn, Reapers, Uruk, Dreadic, Thalmor, whatever, they are the smae thing now they are called the Rhogar. Top points for sounding like the noise I make when I have bronchitis. Long story short, the market for this kind of this is saturated to a point where it is raining bits of archdemon in my house. You would think something like this would work to seperate itself from the pack with something, but if you look at it closely, Lords is a Frankenstine's Monster. Bits of gameplay and stories have just been cherrypicked around from other games. It is official, the guys here have less imagination than the guys who draw the bodywork for Porsche.\n\nFinal words: I am dissaponted, this game received alot of praise when it first came out and I was hopping for a hit I could rack up a couple of hindred hours on and stand around with baited breath for the sequel. Nope, I will not be playing this to 200 hours and I am not waiting for the sequel, if there ever will be one. This game had somuch potential and failed to deliver on every level.

Ive never had such an enjoyable experience playing a heavy fighter, ever.\nThe game crashed about 10 times in 50 hrs of play (much more often after the last patch) but updating to the newly released beta drivers fixed this issue for me.\n\nAll in all i highly recommend this game, its a real gem both visually and gameplay-wise.\n\n\n\n","December 18, 2014","true","106.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The game is desperately trying to ape Dark Souls, and you should really just play any of those games instead. Unlike Lords of the Fallen, their combat feels responsive, their worlds are worth exploring, and there is variety to the roleplaying you can do. In Lords of the Fallen, even wearing the lightest armor, you feel clunky and slow.\nThe best way to illustrate how annoying I found the combat in this game is when fighting against enenies using shields. When not attacking, these enemies always keep their guard up, and take no damage. As in Dark Souls, against enemies like this the best strategy is to break their guard, or circle around them and attack from behind. In Lords of the Fallen, breaking the guard of a shield enemy is so worthless, they regain their composure and are blocking again before I can land 1 hit from my slow weapon. Same with circling around, the time it takes for me to roll out of the way of an attack is enough time for the enemy to put their shield back up again. Fighting enemies like this was so beyond entertaing that I am ready to stop trying to enjoy this game.","April 27","false","8.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyclaw/recommended/265300/","greyclaw","Greyclaw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyclaw/","266 products in account","Lords of the Fallen is a gem of a punishing Action-RPG with alot of replayability and an interesting story with alot of discoverable groundwork for it's lore through audio-notes and hidden areas. Although many people have given this a negative review based on their issues with its stability, I can honestly and shamelessly tell you that I have played this game through twice with an Nvidia 660 Ti and I have NEVER experienced a crash once.\n\nIt saddens me greatly that people flay the game with their issues running it instead of focusing on the gameplay itself. If someone is unable to run it smoothly it is acceptable and understandable to make its stability a major negative point, but I feel this drastically overshadows the game itself and its amount of negative reviews do NOT reflect its worth in my eyes.\n\nOn to the review:\n\nPROs:\n\n-Easy to pick up and play, a challenging yet simple introduction to its genre. A game equally providing the footwork for Dark Souls-esque games to newcomers with a slightly more adaptable learning curve and a challenge for veterans of the genre such as players of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 (I have played all three).\n\n-Great story with titbits of collectable lore. The story is not over the top and hard to follow but is fairly involved if you choose to collect the audio-notes. It gives its players a choice to skip the notes and focus more on the gameplay, leaving the story more of a vanilla 'Knight-kills-monsters' type deal, which is fine too.\n\n-Smooth and responsive combat feel. The games core mechanics reflect your combat style through the gear you use and the weapons you wield, much like the Dark Souls series. If you wear light armor and use daggers, you will be alot more fragile but can potentially land a hit with each button press and have a light and nimble roll. If you wear the heaviest of attires, you will have a clunky roll and your hits will have more of a delay and wind-up to them, reflecting the feel of bearing such a burden, however, you can take alot more punishment before dropping and can hit like a truck. Play your way.\n\nCONs:\n\n-Voice acting and lip sync. Some of the dialogue between the essential NPCs feels almost forced. They play a preset animation loop whilst their dialogue plays over the top. Whilst this doesn't bother some players, such as myself, if you have a strict immersion policy this will be a bother, but is by no means game-breaking.\n\n-Noticeable difficulty drop-off point. After you've been playing for a while and grinding away with those big enchanted weapons and armors of yours, you will start to notice a point where things are dying a bit too quickly. This is mainly an issue if you choose a heavily armored, warrior-type class, where endlessly pouring your points into vitality and strength starts working a little TOO well. On my NG+ of my warrior, I was so big and angry that I only died once, and it was falling off a cliff... you get the point. Whilst this is much less of an issue with rogue-like characters, it should be pointed out. Furthermore, if you are looking for a challenge or are more accustomed to Dark Souls like me, you should definately go for a rogue, as it will provide consistent difficulty, even through your NG+.\n\n-Loot variation system. Whilst the game uses a system where you cannot get the same piece of loot twice, which is a brilliant idea, it simply does not have enough variation in it's gear to support it. All the weapons and armor scale with your attributes so you can potentially keep your favourite sword or helmet forever and all of the equipment is very well modelled and aesthetically pleasing. However, once you find a supreme piece of gear, you spend the rest of the game picking up pennies and belly button lint by comparison. For example, once I got my full 'Lords' set of heavy armor, even in NG+ I couldn't find anything that even came CLOSE to it in comparison, and I am a man who loves his loot.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn short, I had ALOT of fun with this game and its a surefire candidate for my GOTY, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and involved challenge without diving head first into the Souls series. It has alot of solid gameplay hours, beautiful environments and gear, an interesting and involved story and a very 'play-your-way' attitude.\n\n9/10","December 10, 2014","true","33.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This is one of the best aspects of the game.  It really felt that like that good precise Dark Souls style combat.\n\nCaveat:  The combat, so long as you were playing a warrior, was great.  I really liked playing as fast rogue like characters, but I had a hard time pulling this off, personally.  The weapon combo system was great, but enemies reacted way to fast to make good use of Rogue type weapons.  I did not however play as a magic user.  I don't usually like that in games like this.\n\nGraphics: They are really well done.  The details of the world were really really good.  I also overall like the graphic designs in the game.\n\nCaveat: There were some complaints about it being too "WoW like".  Big shoulder pads, crazy helmets, a lighter color palette, but these things didn't bother me.  Some of the armors and weapons in this game were truly awesome to see.\n\nSound:  I don't know if this was a bug that was not fixed before I beat the game but:  The enemies often times made sounds from their deaths several seconds after I killed them, it was really strange.  It's a shame too because the creature sounds were good in my opinion.  When they made the sounds they made, it was what I would expect.\n\nReplayability:  This is probably the biggest mark against it.  I don't foresee myself going through it again as an alternate class.  I started as rogue type character, then starting going into Strength pretty early on because rogues don't feel viable to me.\n\nOther complaints:  Warrior only.  I have said it before but I wanted outline this a bit more.  If you go into a strength build, this allows you to wear the best armors in the game.  You are never much of a damange sponge even with that.  Also, the majority of the time there was simply not enough room to be a character who is flipping all over the place.\n\nAnother one is that the Shield Bash is the most useful move in the game.  It works against the vast majority of creatures.  It was so useful, I couldn't imagine playing without.  You will come across a lot of guys who are carrying huge shields themselves, and the shield bash is the only thing that I feel works on them.\n\nFrustratingly enough, later in the game you will come across enemies that cannot be hurt by physical weapons at all.  At the time I thought I would just have to equip an appropriate rune, but that doesn't hurt them either.  You MUST use your gauntlet.  But if you invested no points in that, then you are looking at a bit of annoyance.  I used a rune that caused my gauntles to catch them on fire, but the effect would end literally when they had barely any perceivable life on their health bar.  I would then dance around avoid their easy to dodge attacks until my magic filled high enough to finish them off.  There are items that help with this, but I don't feel you get enough of them that you can just pop them everytime you need one.  I did finish the game being a bit too over cautious with them though, so that is my fault and not he game.\n\nAll of this said: I ultimately found my experience enjoyable.  The world was rich and interesting and different enough from any Souls game that it did not feel like a clone at any point.  I would not go back on my decision to buy this at full price, and if you catch it on sale it's an even better buy in my opinion, despite the frustrating parts of the game, which were few and far between.","November 26, 2014","true","17.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyclaw/recommended/265300/","greyclaw","Greyclaw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyclaw/","266 products in account","Lords of the Fallen is a gem of a punishing Action-RPG with alot of replayability and an interesting story with alot of discoverable groundwork for it's lore through audio-notes and hidden areas. Although many people have given this a negative review based on their issues with its stability, I can honestly and shamelessly tell you that I have played this game through twice with an Nvidia 660 Ti and I have NEVER experienced a crash once.\n\nIt saddens me greatly that people flay the game with their issues running it instead of focusing on the gameplay itself. If someone is unable to run it smoothly it is acceptable and understandable to make its stability a major negative point, but I feel this drastically overshadows the game itself and its amount of negative reviews do NOT reflect its worth in my eyes.\n\nOn to the review:\n\nPROs:\n\n-Easy to pick up and play, a challenging yet simple introduction to its genre. A game equally providing the footwork for Dark Souls-esque games to newcomers with a slightly more adaptable learning curve and a challenge for veterans of the genre such as players of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 (I have played all three).\n\n-Great story with titbits of collectable lore. The story is not over the top and hard to follow but is fairly involved if you choose to collect the audio-notes. It gives its players a choice to skip the notes and focus more on the gameplay, leaving the story more of a vanilla 'Knight-kills-monsters' type deal, which is fine too.\n\n-Smooth and responsive combat feel. The games core mechanics reflect your combat style through the gear you use and the weapons you wield, much like the Dark Souls series. If you wear light armor and use daggers, you will be alot more fragile but can potentially land a hit with each button press and have a light and nimble roll. If you wear the heaviest of attires, you will have a clunky roll and your hits will have more of a delay and wind-up to them, reflecting the feel of bearing such a burden, however, you can take alot more punishment before dropping and can hit like a truck. Play your way.\n\nCONs:\n\n-Voice acting and lip sync. Some of the dialogue between the essential NPCs feels almost forced. They play a preset animation loop whilst their dialogue plays over the top. Whilst this doesn't bother some players, such as myself, if you have a strict immersion policy this will be a bother, but is by no means game-breaking.\n\n-Noticeable difficulty drop-off point. After you've been playing for a while and grinding away with those big enchanted weapons and armors of yours, you will start to notice a point where things are dying a bit too quickly. This is mainly an issue if you choose a heavily armored, warrior-type class, where endlessly pouring your points into vitality and strength starts working a little TOO well. On my NG+ of my warrior, I was so big and angry that I only died once, and it was falling off a cliff... you get the point. Whilst this is much less of an issue with rogue-like characters, it should be pointed out. Furthermore, if you are looking for a challenge or are more accustomed to Dark Souls like me, you should definately go for a rogue, as it will provide consistent difficulty, even through your NG+.\n\n-Loot variation system. Whilst the game uses a system where you cannot get the same piece of loot twice, which is a brilliant idea, it simply does not have enough variation in it's gear to support it. All the weapons and armor scale with your attributes so you can potentially keep your favourite sword or helmet forever and all of the equipment is very well modelled and aesthetically pleasing. However, once you find a supreme piece of gear, you spend the rest of the game picking up pennies and belly button lint by comparison. For example, once I got my full 'Lords' set of heavy armor, even in NG+ I couldn't find anything that even came CLOSE to it in comparison, and I am a man who loves his loot.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn short, I had ALOT of fun with this game and its a surefire candidate for my GOTY, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and involved challenge without diving head first into the Souls series. It has alot of solid gameplay hours, beautiful environments and gear, an interesting and involved story and a very 'play-your-way' attitude.\n\n9/10","December 10, 2014","true","33.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's an incredibly buggy and unoptimized game.  Until the developers make serious strides in fixing these issues, I'd say hold onto your money.  This is mainly a consequence of the game's qualities just barely overcoming its shortcomings.  When the technical difficulties are thrown into the mix, those qualities have just that much more to contend with.\nFirst, this game is very much in the line of Souls games.  The similarities between the two are numerous: no map, tough enemies, nebulous story, a weight-based movement system, and a leveling/checkpoint system very similar to Dark Soul’s bonfire-based system.  The similarities don’t end there but this game’s status as a “Souls clone” has been well-established.\n\nWith that said, the game does many things well.  The art direction, while it has proven to be somewhat divisive, is quite good.  While some armor has been recycled, the sets look good and fit the world they inhabit.  The animations are fluid.  Hitboxes are generally well done.  Enemies are far more likely to hit you on the back end of their swings than in any of the Souls game.  Whereas in Dark Souls, many encounters could be beaten by simply rolling into enemies, the same cannot be said for Lords of the Fallen.  One must think about his rolls and the direction they will take.  The weight system is practically a copy-pasted system from Dark Souls—a system I’m much more partial to than the system in Dark Souls 2.  On the whole, the game is generally enjoyable to play.\n\nUnfortunately, there are various issues that make it difficult to appreciate the game’s qualities.  Technically, the game is prone to crashes, the framerate is atrocious, and bugs run rampant.  I won’t spend time much time on the technical issues, though.  As for the game, frankly it’s too easy.  Most bosses are easily beaten on the first attempt.  Enemies aren’t too varied which affords the player enough experience within the first handful of hours to breeze through the rest of the game.  The developers try to curb this ease by throwing in, seemingly random, enemies that, while looking like typical enemies, have more health and do a great deal of damage.  Entire sections of the game, especially toward the end, feature enemies that do more damage than any boss in the game does while having a substantial amount of health.  This is fairly frustrating and inconsistent with the world the game is building.  Other issues include the targeting system, which is barely functional.  The magic system is poorly implemented.  Some spells are either poorly designed (Mimic which obscures your character and the enemy), only function a handful of times (Stab, which misses seemingly a third of the time), or are simply not useful (Prayer).  All of these spells also cost a great deal of mana.  My faith build (essentially a magic build) could get off maybe 2-3 spells before going OOM.  Add in the ridiculous cooldown that all spells have and one can hardly be faulted in wondering why magic exists at all.\n\nI’m going to stop here.  The bottom line: the cons outweigh the pros in this offering.  Perhaps a few patches from now and a Steam sale later this game might be worth picking up.\n","November 3, 2014","false","18.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

And in a way it is. But at the same time this game is so poorly balanced that its become impossible to enjoy. Im only several hours into the game and standard enemies can take up to 5-10 minutes to kill, and thats only if im hiding behind a shield and spamming spells while waiting for my magic meter to slowly refill. The enemies are INCREDIBLY powerful. I get that this is supposed to be difficuilt. I played through every soul game with no problem and really enjoyed it. I cant even play this game because of how strong the enemies are. One example is fairly early on, after the second boss there is one enemy RIGHT next to a checkpoint/health crystal thing. You cant kill him. He does over a third of your hp with one attack, which he spams in a 3 hit combo. One attack from him completely drains your energy if your behind a shield. He has an attack where he knocks your shield away and then immedietly attacks for over 3/4 of your hp. No way to dodge it its incredibly fast. And dont even think about hurting him.  Literally whenever hes not doing insane amounts of damage, hes hiding behind his shield. If you attack him here you do ONE point of damage and your weapon bounces off. Doesnt matter if its a light attack, heavy attack, one handed or two handed. Always one point. Always bounce off. And you cant get around him because the ♥♥♥♥er spins like hes in a roller disco. I thought this game was going to be good. And it would be with some more balance. But holy ♥♥♥♥ the enemies do way too much damage and take hardly any damage in return. Your also slow as ♥♥♥♥ing hell.

I have several dozen hours in Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1, over 200h on Dark Souls 2 and about 100 in Bloodborne on record. The game is simply not worth 50€/$ even if someone likes it. It's to poorly executed in gameplay.\n\nFirst the Pros:\n\nGraphics an Art Style are pretty neat. The game looks really good but that takes a lot of hardware. Still, looks better than Dark Souls 2 Sotfs or even Bloodborne in my opinion (only graphic wise, not atmospheric). The armors and weapons have a nice design and destinct look each, sharp textures as far as i could tell (playing on 1920x1080).\n\nThey have some nice ideas gameplay wise like the reduced stamina cost for the next attack when you time it right or the exp multiplier. I like that and would appreciate it in future Souls games.\n\nAnd... thats it.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nIf you expect a precise battle system like the ones from Dark Souls or Bloodborne you will be very disappointed. The attacks of nearly all enemies hit you even if they are already finished an the hit zones are much to large compared to the looks of the attacks. You take damage even if you are way away from an enemy.\n\nYou can't "trick" them by learning their patterns and use fast weapon swings in between to stagger them - apparently the don't have poise. They only get staggered by really hard hits like the strong sprint attack, but you can't combo after those attacks an you are completely open for a hit and take guaranteed damage. Enemies aren't really "open" after an attack, each of them has basically only 1 attack after which you can strike them and are designed and scripted to work that way, There are no nuances in that and no variation depending on the weapon you use. It's scripted when you can hit enemies regardless of weapon choice. So just take the biggest and wait.\n\nYou can't circle enemies because every attacks aims newly on you and they turn on spot in a fraction of a second without an animation, the basically float while attacking. So dodging, even if you hit the invincibility frame (where ever that is, never found it), will get you no where 'cause you have to dodge all of the 3-4 swings of an enemy combo and will be completely out of stamina when  you are done.\n\nYou on the other side will get staggered from every. single. hit. Even the tiniest slap from the fist of an weak archer will completely stop any of your movements even in full sprint trying an onslaught attack on them with an leap attack. You look like a 300 pound tank with a big ♥♥♥ axe, sprint towards them, jump an leap your weapon over your head and the they slap you for like 3 damage and stun you out of the air to the ground.\n\nPlus enemies are extremely fast in everything they do compared to you. Even your 1-handed sword swings are slower than a giant long reach swing attack of an enemy with a huge weapon.\n\nSo: The balancing in speed and poise is complete off. Enemies are made harder simply because the rule that apply to you don't apply to them.\n\nDamage wise it's the same thing. Once you beat the 4th boss and get back into the Monastery you will meet the first boss again as a trash mob. You will have found the all new griffin armor with really nice defense values. Still, this "new" trash mob here can easily one-shot you. A trash mob. ONE SHOT. I get it that an ex-boss deals a lot of damage and should be dealt with care. But this is not acceptable. Off course you can beat him, you did it earlier so it's not a real problem here, but this is a perfect example of how badly balanced the whole game is. Oh and by the way: The Swing from above (which is the attack that will deal 300 damage flat) has an area off effect that damages you even if you are not close to the hit. And I mean sideways, I'm very aware of the floor ray that extends the attacks length and I'm not talking about that.\n\nI bought the game because a lot of reviews were quite positive, from users and from magazines. But Deck13 is still where they were before this games release: B-Class studio, not even A, and far away from AAA titles.\n\nThey probably thought the battle system depends on giving the player disadvantages in every aspect of the game, but forgot to add possibilities to overcome them.\n\nThey took the battle system from Souls and ♥♥♥♥ed up balancing, timing, speed and hit zones.\n\nEvery one who played a decent amount of the Souls games has a better understanding of this battle system and how the balancing should work out. Deck13 made a very, very poor attempt to copy that and failed massively. Souls veterans will most likely be disappointed  and newcomers will be confronted with very poor execution of the genre and might get repelled to try the good examples.\n\nThe camera bobbing from hell annoys as well and can't be turned off. Like on the frigging Titanic.\n","May 16, 2015","false","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You decide what % off is appropriate based on my below comments.\n\nPros\nThis is a more forgiving Dark Souls, well executed art and decent sound work. Control is snappy, overall gameplay feel is good.\n\nCons\nStability was my biggest issue and the one keeping me from playing further. In the first 15 seconds of starting a game I got a black screen lockup I could alt tab out of and restart the game.\n\nThen I had a hard freeze mid swing in combat that I couldnt get out of and was about to hold my power button after about 10 minutes when the game shut and my system accepted all the input id been trying to give it.\n\n**Unfortunately for me, a big part of this game is centered around NOT SAVING. Seriously, how long can you go without dying or using a save crystal, the longer you go the bigger an xp/loot multiplier you build up, if you save/heal up at a save point your multiplier resets.**\n\nMy second fatal crash/lockup came about 2 hours into a streak. Lost all of that progress. You know that feel, I know you do.\n\nTLDR: Game with core mechanic tempting the player not to save progress, crashes frequently on current hardware.

Monsters will be placed on certain spots making it impossible to avoid the first time you walk around that corner or something like that. and some of the monsters and even bosses hitboxes are too big so you get hit when "you clearely see that´s impossible" but as I said this can be argued.\nGear and loot is not explained very well or clearely so you might end up having to go online looking for info. I  can see this as a  pro and a con depending on what type of gamer you are. Some of Dark Souls alure was that you where left to understand and take it on and learn through trail and error. It feels like Lord of the fallen tries to mimic that a bit with mixxed results.\nSound glitches\n\nDark Souls / Demon Souls must have been an inspiration for the developers I can see many aspects of wich it mimics but with less punishing gameplay. At the same time this games difficulty is somewhat random. Most of the mobs in the starting area don´t do too much damage but later in the earlier levels you come across some spitting spider thingies that will do an insane amount of damage only to leave a taste that this balance is looked over and unbalanced. Maybe the developers thought of it as a way of making the game feel difficult and to offset you, this can be argued.\n\nLord Of The Fallen as a whole feels like a powertrip with a big stick swinging at you some times. The games balance seem overlooked or is passed on as a way of making it feel more random and as such more difficult, I would argue that this is a hit or miss, good game design or bad game design.\n\nEven though Lord of the fallen have many great strong points those are outweighed by the cons, the constant crashing and the random performance cuppled with what I think is really uneven balance.\n\n\nPros\n\nBrilliant\nSort of my dream game\nSomeone made the game I want to play\nAwesome character looks and feel\nLoot\nLots of secret ways to unlock sections and more loot\nCan look amazingly awesome\nBreakables\nBoss battles but they are hit or miss fun wise\nExtra layer of gameplay if you kill the boss in a certain way you get an upgraded version of the weapon it drops.\n","October 23, 2015","false","32.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Of course people will compare to it as it is its main inspiration, Though i think the title is a little weaker in many points, starting with the level design and the sense of freedom and exploration. In fact, most of the game (at least what i've seen so far) resolve around corridors that leads to enemies that open doors to another corridors bound together by cutscenes and so it can feels slightly brainless.\nAlso, the lore and story aren't a big suprise even if quite decent, but it might sounds dull if you grew bored of that sort of, like, regular heroic fantasy with muscles and big boobs. Characters are a bit cliché when not completly blank...\n\nYet it's not a bad game. Combats are fun and the game does a pretty good job at giving you reason to just go through the corridors. At least if you're a bit curious.\n\nSo yeah, i'd recommand it. Not at full price though.

Having freshly beat it and played about 30 minutes into my New Game +, here is what I have to say.\n\nLords of the Fallen got a bad rep on release for being a Souls rip-off. This is, to some extent, true. However, the formula has been boiled down to its most basic components and new usability features added, resulting in a much more accessible game.\n\nThe game has a story. It's not brilliant, and on the first playthrough it's not actually possible to get all of the lore, but it was interesting enough to keep me hooked and playing the game.\n\nThe game also has a dialogue system. You won't use it a whole lot and npc interactions are fairly scarce, but it exists and contributes to some of the game's more poignant moments.\n\nThe game is bloody beautiful. Apart from lacking character customization, the weapons and armor are well designed and detailed, the enemies and environments are detailed, and the particle effects are well done. Props to the developers on that.\n\nThe game is responsive. People complaining about long lag times between input and action are *probably* running a sword and board strength build. Dual-wielding while wearing light armor is much faster, but an unpopular choice because of the inability to block. Don't listen to people wielding greathammers with one hand and a tower shield with the other.\n\nQuests are vague af. I only barely registered the planetarium quest's existence despite clearing almost all the other ones, and by the time I had the items I went into the room and couldn't find anything to activate due to how far I was in the story, but the ending told me that yes it was possible and I was a dumb.\n\nOccasional steam controller sync bugs, and the quest prompt occasionally would reset for no reason or display the incorrect objective.\n\nThe game is $20. The DLC is $8... Buy the game. If you like it and care about achievements get the DLC, otherwise ignore it as it's not brilliant. Even if you're a souls fan, buy the game. It's shorter and easier than most of the souls titles, but still an engaging experience that doesn't deserve to be maligned by people who haven't bothered to try it. I loved every minute of my first playthrough, and will definitely be back for more.","May 3","true","20.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Lords of the Fallen is a very unique game even though it carries many of dakrsiders qualities. DarkSiders 2 is more of a death simulator and This game is somewhat a hack and slash. I mean its not entirely lets rush in and spam left mouse but it is a lot more of you being involved and attacking rather then waiting and watching your enemies attack patterns. Even though its more hack and slash like its not more forgiving. When you die you leave the white mist like object behind you and it gives you a certain amount of time to grab it. It starts from 100% and works its way down. Even though this seems easy the fact that the enemy will still be there makes you think if you would rather fetch it or attempt to kill the enemy first. Many people said it was a pushover but for me this was not the case since i didnt play darksouls or darksouls 2 before this game. Think of it as a kind of tutorial game for people who havent played Darksouls. Since i have spoken about my personal experience i will now tell you about graphics gameplay and issues. At this moment in time even though i have played 2.4 hours i have not had one single issue with this game. It has ran smoothly except for the second boss where it dropped fps for about 1 second. Graphic wise this game is beautiful. The beautiful environment and the way everything works with one another can change it from being peacful to a bloodbath in an instant without feeling clunky and all over the place.

The game was easy, shield are OP, the animations of attack were slow (probabily more realistic, but waiting 1 second to deliver a blow could be a bit frustrating. This might be a fault of Souls game that get us used to see the berserk's sword swinged easly as longsword).\nThe game got some balance issues with pacemaker you can easly achive 5XX dmg, comboing 2k dmg. That damage is insane!!! (socketing the ENDGAME rune give you ~16 damage, the luck give you ~200). Trading blow with bosses is efficent, imho it SHOULD NOT BE efficent, you got tons of pots, they can just repeat the attacks.\nSpells are game breaking, creating a clone of you that taunt the enemy is broken.(i didn't tested other spells, didn't needed to).\nTo find the game a bit more challenging i dropped the shield and the spell and used only slow 2h weapon, maybe i'll try again with a stealth/agy class and the game will be really hard, i hope so!!\n\n\nPro\nthe game look fantastic\nThe armors and the weapons are really cool\nThe weapon got weight when they got swinged, and mobs react to that.\nThe reward weapon got some cool effects (only them).\nThe enemy are cool, they seems to have a nice AI, and the skinny undead are really unpredictable.\nThe game is easyer than DS 2 and DS 1\nThe game have nice ideas (event challenges are really cool).\n\nCons\nThe objective of the boss fight is not shown before the boss\nYou got the same animation for almost every weapon of the same class.\nThe armors and the weapons are really cool (every armor is too cool).\nThe game have no pvp/online.\nThe game is quite short(yea you can play in ng+/++)[dark souls 2/1 have the same price and the world "bigger" and it is filled with more content].\nThe story was not so good, imho.\nThe game is easyer than DS 2 and DS 1\nStereotypical npc with low personality\nSome area go recycled\n\nBtw i had fun smashing mobs with my 2handed axe/sword/hammer but sadly it didn't last long, but it was quite funny!!\nI rank this game 6 only because we already got souls game to play with, but if we would have not, i would have ranked this game higher.\n\n~ Levirax","December 2, 2014","false","18.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I beat it in 8 hours of playtime. No multiplayer, limited sidequests that are very vague and confusing levels had me getting mixed up all over the place. There were not very many bosses and they were all pretty easy. Only two bosses actually killed me.\nThis game is NOT Dark Souls. Not even close. It uses dark souls combat mechanics like health potions that refill at checkpoints, dodge rolls, and left hand/right hand on LB/LT and RB/RT. The same mechanics are in it but the feel is much different. Everything in Dark Souls is very thoughtful and you can learn your opponents moves and such to make it a lot easier, but even as a magic build I found myself just smacking everything in the face with my hammer and ignoring damage.\nIt was a very easy game, the only challenging part was that the level layouts are confusing and mazelike. I did enjoy the game, but it felt like it could have been so much more. I will probably do the NG+ but I don't recommend it for $50. Get it on sale and it will be fun for a while.\nTL:DR Fun but too short and no multiplayer. Do not expect it to be like Dark Souls. Mechanics are similar, but the game is way different.","December 6, 2014","false","14.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I love the Dark Souls series and since this game is basically a easier version i like this too.\nBUT!  It seems like it still has a ton of problems. In my case it would be the constant crashes. I mean 6 crashes in under an hour? I'm patient but that is kind of awful. And before anyone asks, i did update my graphics card drivers.\nSince the reviews split into 2 camps, meaning those who have the crashes and the those who dont, there is no accurate way to tell if you should recommend it or not. But right now, i do get the crashes and i think i should have waited to purchase this. So recommend it or not?\nNot right now. Will change if something changes or if there is a resolution to fix it.\nIf you still buy it you probably have a 50/50 chance it does work. Do you feel lucky?\n\n\nEDIT: So i may have judged this problem too fast before really looking into it. It works fine for me now and another 2 hours into the game i do think have an explanation.\n\nSo it seems like the Nvidia Trubulance feature caused the constant crashes, which is kind of weird because i have n Nvidia GTX 970. So by deactivating the feature it didnt crash on me again. So basically what the problem seems to be for Nvidia card owner is that the function itself causes some kind of problem and thus creating the crashes. And i guess alot of ppl don't have that problem because the have AMD card's and this feature is in general turned off? I don't really know, that is just my guess.\n\nAnyways.....having a lot of fun playing it.
