Only real issue I see with this game is the value you assign to the experience relative to its price. If I had purchased it at retail price when it first came out I would undoubtedly been dissapointed at its briefness but for sale in the pendulo pack or it's current price point its fine.\n\nGive it a go if you are a genre fan, for sure.","October 17, 2014","true","12.7"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","56","62","2","5"

Things are not what they seem in this great story of deceit and mystery. You start out as Henry White and his friend cooper who works for a charitable company that helps the homeless.  Well at your first stop you find two crazy guys doing some weird ritual and they end up trying to kill you. You win out and the game flashes forward some time.\n\nNow you take over our main protagonist John Yesterday who has amnesia and is trying to figure out who he really is and about his past. You work for Henry White doing research for him when you start remembering things and realize all is not what it seems. This all leads up to a choice of four different endings and will give you some replay value to see them all.\n\nThe art style is fantastic and really fits with the game. Gameplay is what you would get from point and click adventures with some tough challenging puzzles but nothing too hard to accomplish.  There’s also a hint button you can use to help you out if you’re stuck which recharges over time after every use. This way you do actually have to try. I did really like when you would click on something the characters wouldn’t take forever to walk to the item. The characters would appear next the object which is a big plus as sometimes it can seem forever to search areas on other games of this genre.\n\nPendulo Studios have done another great job at bringing us a great story with romance, humor, and mystery which deserves to be noticed. Only thing I wish is the game was a little longer to enjoy. If you like point and click adventure games, puzzles, and a great story than I highly recommend you check this game out.\n\nBear Rating: 8/10","January 11, 2014","true","6.5"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

It has lots of casual murder, so yes. YES!\n\nBut…\n\n…the game is very, very short and very, very easy. I’m neither a clever man nor an avid adventure gamer and I always need to look up what to do in walkthroughs sooner or later. That being said, Yesterday took me roughly 3.5 hours to finish and I breezed through it. Some of the riddles are just stupid too, like right at the beginning you must reconstruct a payphone to call someone and even though you have a mobile and the person you’re trying to call has one too the game never even allows you to try to use your mobile.\n\n…all the cut-scenes are… minimalistic, is a word that could describe them, I guess. They’re mostly just a series of snapshots and fade-to-blacks instead of a short movie or there’re just animations in front of a black background.\n\n…the game has very few locations, very few riddles, very few dialogs, very few items, very few of everything basically. For example, the cast size is tiny and there are basically no secondary or background characters.\n\n…the story is rather incoherent at times, which is a result of budgetary limitations, I think. Too many holes in the narrative, too. Throughout the entire game I had the impression that half of it was missing. Scenes just start and you don’t know why, scenes just end and you don’t really know how, facts are stated and information are given and there is a general lack of context present at all times.\n\n…there are story twists planted in the narrative but they’re NOT played out so that at some point you just think to yourself “oh, that person was this?” and then you shrug your shoulders because the timing is messed up. And that’s very unfortunate because early on they actually prove that they know how to properly time a twist.\n\n…everything feels really underdeveloped, especially the characters. By now we can see the theme I’m going for, I reckon. Because of the tight budged nothing really has room to breathe and time to unfold. You meet a villain and in the same scene you dispose of him, you meet a character and five minutes later you’re already big chums with them. It’s stripped down to the bare essentials.\n\n\nSo I think what I’m trying to say is this: There is a jarring chasm between the very big and lavishly played out prologue and the rest of the game, which really hammers home the point that they planned a big old adventure game in the tradition of their very own Runaway series but were forced to make a very, very small game in the end.\n\n\nAnd still, the atmosphere is fantastic, dark and creepy and weird and aloof and just spot on; the music is sometimes great (and sometimes just cringeworthy), the voice acting is rather good all around, the writing is never bad and quite good at times; the game is not funny nor does it try to be funny and the story is dark and evil and heavily inspired by the occult. They also have played a lot of PlaneScape: Torment, I’d say and that is never a bad thing. And they start the game with a proper mind♥♥♥♥!\n\nSo yes, it is absolutely worth the 3-4 hours you’ll spend with it. If 3-4 hours are worth 10 Euros to you, that is for you to decide though.","November 8, 2014","true","4.0"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

It offers an interesting story, logical, though sometimes complex (even when easy) puzzles, and generally simplified gameplay.\n\nThere really isn’t a lot this player can say about "Yesterday" without saying too much. The story involves numerous genuinely interesting characters over many years and locations. It involves Satanism, amnesia and rebirth (of several varieties), torture, romance and a considerable amount of violence (very little of it graphic.) One of what this reviewer considers the strongest features of “Yesterday” is a well-designed hint system, used in conjunction with logical and intelligent puzzles. In far too many game players struggle to solve totally illogical puzzles using every single silly article in inventory (“ADventure Lib” and “City of Fools” satirize this wonderfully.) “Yesterday” may add literally dozens of items to inventory, and use only a few, or parts of a few without removing the remaining components. And the puzzles are intelligence based, though there is still a fair amount of trying to combine every new item with all existing items. The hint system is available once several attempts have been made, and it may offer a vague hint, or the answer outright. As long as the player makes every effort on their own, the hints won’t necessarily feel like cheating, though they often make you feel silly for missing something obvious in retrospect. Still, it's far more workable than, and just as thorough as, a reliance on walkthroughs.\n\nJohn Yesterday is a man without memory of his past, and along with his mother Elaine, an investigator into satanic matters. Along with his mother, he is aided in recovering his memories by his friend and mentor, Henry White, who has a history of helping the homeless, and is now one of the richest men in the world. But that’s not where the story begins, and certainly not where it ends. The story continues in Paris, rural Scotland, and the Himalayas, with numerous other stops in space and time. The story never gets boring, or slows more than for the occasional necessary change of pace, though this player would have prefered a bit less "deus ex machina". There is some very welcome humor in this story, especially the American tourists in Paris. An unusual feature at the end allows the player to decide which remaining character is the “game changer” in the final scene (though I suspect nearly everyone makes the same choice.) When “Yesterday” ends, one reviewer can almost guarantee the average player will want more. (BTW, if you complete the game, finish the credits for a hint as to a sequel.)\n\n“Yesterday”'s graphics are not its strongest feature, but very adequate, quite pleasant, and never vague or confusing. Susanne is made beautiful enough (at least for me) to allow a great deal of lenience. The voice acting is above average…usually. (Henry White is a bit overdone.) Gameplay is very good, though grabbing items from inventory never felt natural. Using the same cute text in trying inventory objects against background points grew monotonous, but maybe it really wasn’t necessary for it to be attempted so often. They were almost always appropriate and clever…the first time or two. I really appreciated the method of moving the game along by fading out, then in, instead of walking full distances.\n\nAll in all, “Yesterday” was an unusually good game, at an exceptional package price, which is best for a short game such as this. (I purchased "Yesterday" cheaply, but the regular price of $10US seems a bit high) The good far overwhelms what little weakness there is in this game.\n\n(As with many Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)","September 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","2"

Some great features such as how the tips take time to fill before you can look at them, and a decent plot, art style and set of characters. The only downside to this game is that the game takes about 4 hours to complete without using tips, and that I didn't want it to end so soon.

You end up on a journey of discovery while unraveling the mystery of your lost memory while finding out why homeless people have been disappearing.\n\nThis was a pretty cool point and click adventure with quite a bit of depth. The story was one of the better ones in a PnC game, IMO, The graphics were well done in classic PnC style. The travels and adversity you face makje for a compelling journey. There are flashbacks, including a bit of a Kung Fu/Carradine rip off which was still pretty cool.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were mostly reasonably easy, but there were a couple intricate ones that had me guessing for a while before finally sorting them out, so there is definitely a challenge awaiting you in this game. Nothing insurmountable however.\n\nI really enjoyed this game and in fact played through it twice (although my Steam time played count is skewed due to the process not shutting down over a weekend for some random reason).\n\nI think this game deserves about an 8 out of 10 across the board.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsexual/recommended/205840/","madsexual","Netflix and Phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsexual/","273 products in account","GAMEPLAY: As a classic Sierra/LucasArts-style adventure game, Yesterday tries very hard to smooth over the inherent tedium of the genre. There is very limited walking animation, as the player most often warps directly to the focal point of a click. There is a built-in hint system that nudges rather than spoilers with a timer that attempts to keep the player from exploiting it (the timer is very short however, so if you're stuck, you'll get your answer soon enough). On the plus side, this keeps the game moving; there is some question, however, whether or not this diminishes the investment one might put into solving the puzzles and the sense of accomplishment that acts as the only game-y reward in this style of game. The puzzles are reasonable. The few leaps of logic are easy to work with given the hint system and the simple fact that madly clicking all over the screen will often yield progress. It is also worth noting that it is entirely impossible to fail at this game. There are no scenarios that actually present a failure state despite the narrative suggesting the imminence of danger to the player character.\n\nSTORY/PLOT: Classic adventure games are all about story and puzzles. The overwhelming sense is that Pendulo wanted to make a 20 hour game but only had the time/budget/skill for 4 hours. As a result, there are poorly developed characters with inexplicable motivation, rushed exposition, an abrupt ending, and (perhaps most jarringly) an over-reliance on hackneyed hero tropes (looking at you Buddhist Vodoo sensei). The game's narrative approach is best executed in the very beginning. Without giving too much away, if you find yourself strongly disliking the initial player character, rest assured that it is one of the few well-executed narrative devices the game offers.\n\nSTYLE: The graphical style appears to be suggestive of a comic book style with text pop-ups and concurrent frames of action. The character models are generally horrible. The presentation of the characters is also not done any favors from the Fallout 1/2 style dialogue windows where characters look directly at the camera while speaking with very little facial animation or proper lip synching. Given the limitations of the game's production, I am inclined to forgive this forray into the Uncanny Valley, but it does have the effect of rendering what limited characterization and drama that does exist flat and often laughable. It would have been much more effective to merely voice the dialogue in the regular gameplay field. As to the voice acting itself, I am pleased that it is far from the game's greatest failing. It is certainly a far stretch from exemplary, but it convey's its meaning ably enough to not be the biggest distraction in the unfolding of the game's ambitious plot.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I cannot recommend this game unless you are dying for a semi-3D adventure and have played literally everything else. The plot is disjointed. The characters are shallow. The puzzles are uninspired and require little to no cleverness or ingenuity. Perhaps the 70's grindhouse Satanic cult theme will entice you, but much like the afore mentioned efforts, that too does little to honor the glory of the dark master. Avoid Yesterday like yesterday's sushi.","December 1, 2013","false","3.9"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","25","39","0","0"

I got this on sale for about 2-3 dollars and that, to me, is a fair price for the 4 hours it took to finish. It's an entertaining point & click adventure that could've been so much more if time was put into it. I enjoyed the characters, the plot twists, the settings, and the concepts. A lot of the puzzles were fun and interesting to figure out on my own, and I genuinly found myself being immersed in the world. The issue, I believe, is that not enough time was put into these things.\n\nThe characters and their relationships could've been fleshed out more.\nThe story and its concepts could've been more explored and explained to the player.\nThe settings could've been made bigger and more involved(Settings are various but come and go way to quickly).\n\nThe only serious complaints I have are price(which I've already brought up), and a few puzzles that were just weird.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paranoidude/recommended/205840/","paranoidude","Paranoid Dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paranoidude/","260 products in account","Yesterday is a fun adventure game that I would recommend to fans of adventure and fun, non-linear stories. The story is easily the strongest part of the game, and it genuinely kept me on the edge of my seat and scratching my head in the beginning (in a good way). By the end of the game, it gets a little cliche, but the beginning starts off strong enough to definitely get you to the end. Without spoiling anything, the characters are definitely an enjoyable and memorable cast. You dislike the bad guys, like the good guys, et cetera.\n\nBut that's enough about the story, how's the gameplay? Well, it is a point-and-click adventure at heart, and it works as well as you'd hope. Sometimes you'll find puzzles that require a group of items to be combined together, and only using one of the items on the enviornment is enough to solve the puzzle. Combining items also works well, and as someone who will default to "try everything on everything" I never once accidentally solved a puzzle before I figured out what was asked of me. There's also a hint system that works pretty well. At any given time, you can activate a hint that displays a blip over all interactable points in the environment, which proves to help, when in clustered, zoomed out areas, you're not so sure what is part of the setting and what is actually usable, which happens a lot so it's good that there is a built-in system to overcome it. The other kind of hint, which you can only use after interacting with objects a few times, is... a hint! The hints tend to vary from "Use blank on blank." to "What can you use to blank?" It would be nice if there was a way to filter out hints that straight-up solve puzzles for you, and hints that gently point you in the right direction, but there is not.\n\nOkay, so, as much as I would like to pretend that graphics and animation don't matter, I can't pretend that some people might be turned off by the game's lack luster animations. When characters talk, their mouth animations tend to repeat in a somewhat comedic manner, looking like they're just flapping their lips faster than humanly possible. It's a little distracting when you're having a dramatic moment, and the bad guys can't be arsed to have their mouth movements match their words. The cutscenes are also a little comedically bad, but they at least the characters are lip-synced. However, it seems that the cutscenes lacked a choreographer, since there isn't much in the ways of fist-fights. There is a scene where two characters are fighting with swords, and the cutscene turns itself into a cut-powerpoint. It's bad, it's funny, it's a little lazy.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd say that this game is great if you aren't expecting a top-class triple-A game.

Satanic cults, ♥♥♥-kicking, globe-trotting, ancient mysteries, a love interest... throw in the whip-cracking and this game would have it all. It's dark, it's surprising, and all in all it's a solid four-hours entertainment.\n\nIt does have its faults, but they're all pretty managable. The puzzles get pretty obscure from to time to time, and althought there is an in-game hint system, it's poorly programmed and tends to give you hints out of order. Dialogue portraits are also typically twitchy and weirdly animated, and the voice acting itself is rushed to keep in sync with the subtitles - which still don't always fit. Gets pretty annoying at times, especially when the game dumps long exposition trees on you.\n\nBut on the whole, I'd strongly recommend this one.  It's good fun, if, uh, hobos getting massacred is the kind of thing you find entertaining.","December 25, 2014","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It still has a touch of the madcap zaniness that was hit or miss with the Runaway series as well as The Next Big Thing but distilled into a supernatural thriller with enough good twists and turns to keep you entertained until the end.\n\nMost of the gameplay has you playing as John Yesterday, professional investigator for multi-billionaire Henry White. Unfortunately, John has amnesia, but Pendulo went all in making this amnesia story one for the books. As a story, it constantly subverts your expectations, right from the opening dedication where you think it'll be an adventure game about helping the homeless. Gradually, as the layers of the story get peeled away and start to form a cohesive whole, it turns into something special. The characters are memorable aside from John's stock love interest. She has all the personality of Gina from Runaway: A Road Adventure, which is to say she none. Liz Allaire she is not. At least all the dialogue is delivered with much aplomb, or at least up to Pendulo's usual standards.\n\nAs for the puzzles, some reviews have touched upon them being easy but I found myself having to use the built in help system a few times after having exhausted all possible solutions, but at least this time most of the solutions make sense in the game world. No 'peanut butter' puzzles to be found. That said, it's possible to acquire 'red herring' items which can add some unneeded difficulty to puzzles. For the most part, areas are limited to two or three screens at a time which keeps frustration at a minimum.\n\nThe save system is kind of weird. It doesn't break the mold as badly as The Next Big Thing tried to do but is more like what you find in Machinarium or Botanicula, whereby your progress is saved automatically but you can select scenes to replay as if you were watching a movie on DVD.\n\nGreat story, great characters, great presentation. Pendulo's really come into their own after their wacky adventures in Runaway. I'd be down for Yesterday 2 if they've got one in the works.","July 4, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Especially at the end.  That and I'm not a fan of the "picture collage" approach to cutscenes. These things are not big issues but it annoyed me a little.\n\nThe individual scenes are basically hidden object oriented. The items don't highlight when you move the mouse over so it gets irritating. You end up using the "show the stuff" button way too often and because it only blinks for a second you need to use it several times to see where all the usable items are on the map and the button has a delay!\n\nThe puzzles were a bit too straight forward for my taste.\nWhat I Liked:\nThe character sort of teleports from one item to the other so you don't have so watch him walk from one corner of the room to the other. At first it was distracting but I got used to it and I think it's a great feature that cuts out the most tedious aspect of this genre.\n\nHas a great built-in hint system that removes any frustration when you get stuck.\n\nThe story won me over eventually. Took a while though. However, being the most important part of games like these it counts the most.\nIn the end, even though the story was mediocre at first, about halfway through it gets a lot more interesting. Enough to earn a thumbs up. Despite comming off as trying too much at times and some characters being over the top, I still enjoyed it.\n\nP.S.: Get it on a sale because it's only about 4 hours long.","February 22","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The quality acting and the well-written story will easily suck you into this world, but sadly not for long: the game is shorter than most budget indie adventure titles.\n\nLong version:\nYesterday is probably the strangest game Péndulo Studios made since they hit big in 2001. It moves away from the previous titles’ colourful and light atmosphere and introduces us a bloody thriller involving satanic cults, torture, a serial killer, and a big load of mystery in the form of the protagonist, who suffers from a very strange case of amnesia.\n\nSince this is a dark story, the visuals reflect this all the way: the scenes are realistic and use mainly darker tones, but they are not moody. The storytelling is done by using European style comic panels with probably the best voice acting we heard so far in a Péndulo game.\nThe puzzles are quite straightforward. You will probably spend more time with cross-inventory trial and error than trying to figure out what the developers intended for a certain scene.\n\nThe greatest problem with the game is the length. It barely reaches four hours if you are even decent at adventure games. I forgot to make a save by quitting (another shortcoming: you cannot save) and I had to race through the story again to watch the other endings; this is how I realised you can speed through the whole game in less than 20 minutes. The story itself may compensate for it, but since it’s a thriller-mystery, the replay/rewatch value is quite low. Still, for the few hours it lasts, it's good, really good.","August 5, 2014","true","3.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

With that being my only experience with Pendulo games, I loaded this one up expecting another light-hearted point-and-click, and was confronted with torture, murder, and Satanic cults. What a twist!\n\nThe story is unique and I enjoyed the visual style. The voice acting left a little to be desired. However, I thought the game's biggest flaw was its length. I felt like the story could have been so much MORE. This game just skimmed the surface of the universe of the game, and because of this, I never really felt any immersion or connection to the characters. Maybe this was a stylistic choice on the part of the development team to reflect John Yesterday's amnesia, but it mostly feels like they ran out of resources and had to cut parts out.\n\nAn example of this is near the end of the game, when two of the antagonists discuss how they murdered a colleague together years previously. This colleague's name was mentioned once in a throwaway line earlier in the game when you examine an object. This left me going, "What? What did you do?? Why did you do it? Who was this guy??", and with no answers present in the game's story, I'm wondering why the developers even chose to include such a detail.\n\nI think I would have been less forgiving of this game's flaws had I paid the $11CAD that is the game's usual full price, but if you are a point-and-click adventure fan, see it on sale, and have 3 or 4 hours to kill, you might want to pick it up. Just expect to be overcome with a feeling of "That's it?" when you finish.","November 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a few thematic narrative elements to the game that really work well, particularly in terms of parallelism (i.e., paralleling one set of events with another).\n\nThe problem for me was that the good story was wrapped up some clunky mechanics based on how current adventure games are implemented. As one example, your character sort of "teleports" around to make the game a little less tedious, so you don't have to see the toon walking from place to place. However, while nice from a game play perspective, it sort of disconnects you from the environment you are playing in. There is also the standard adventure game problem of being a character that ends up carrying around odd items just in case they become useful and then figuring out strange ways to combine these items to achieve an effect.\n\nAgain, though, the story is very intriguing. The pacing of the story is held up a bit by those mechanics I just mentioned as well as the fact that much of the story is filled to you in expository segments that don't flow as part of the story, but rather that take place via "disconnected" close ups of characters faces. Yet, even with that, I go back to what I keep saying: the story is intriguing, albeit very dark. I think this game was quite ambitious in the story it wanted to tell and did some clever tricks in terms of how it was presenting, including a few twists along the way. There are multiple endings and, at least for the one I chose, I found it a very satisfying conclusion.","December 25, 2013","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yesterday has a few good story twist but over all characters feel as close to you as that third cousin you only see at family reunions. This ‘point & click’ adventure game visits the story/puzzle based games we all loved of yesterday, but with the unfortunate price of today.  Would you pay 30 bucks for roughly 5 hours of game play?

The quasi-cel shaded characters, in true Pendulo tradition, are expertly crafted.  The backgrounds look great, running the gamut from super-detailed (the antique book shop) to impressionistic (the mystical Himalayan temple), depending on the mood.  The in-game animations are brief and subtle, full of rapid cuts, dramatic freeze frames, and often taking place within comic book panels.  Just reading this, you may think that this animation style sounds cheap -- in actuality it makes the game feel like an electric combo of thriller film and fast-paced graphic novel.  The narrative involves dark magic, torture, serial killers and a centuries-old Satanic cult.  While all of these elements have been used countless times before, Yesterday handles them with real style, assembling them into a highly engaging story with some very unique twists (this coming from a guy who has read a lot of fiction about this type of thing).  The puzzles may be simpler than in some of the past Pendulo games, but they aren't exactly easy unless you turn lousy cheater and invoke the hint feature.  DON'T INVOKE THE HINT FEATURE!  The game will last longer and be far more satisfying if you don't!\n\nFor my money, this game is definitely worth the full price.  If you are still on the fence about it, it's constantly on sale for 4 bucks or less, and that is a true steal for what you are getting.","January 3, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The help system is extremely useful for those who are like me and fail at puzzles more often than not. The hotspots revealer is also extremely useful. Make sure to investigate everything, there's some very witty commentary tucked in some texts.\n\nBe aware that the talking animations are.... weird, I found them sort of distracting.

The puzzles are very logical, but still require you to put some effort into things. Every level is a gem and you'll feel happy when you finish it. None of the puzzles require you to take any notes or use items in ways you'd never imagine them being used. This game is really more geared for when you just want to play a short game and not bother with too much hassle, it's a casual game.\n\nThe story offers you a nice little mystery of which I won't tell you anything in order not to spoil anything. It won't leave you reeling with any great revelations, but you are offered some interesting characters and situations and sometimes things do turn out just that little bit different from what you were expecting.\nThe themes can a bit heavy even though nothing too gruesome is shown, but I would recommend that players at least be teens before trying out this little gem.\n\nThe voice acting in this game was sublime, the voice actors really did a good job.\nWhat I did not like about the game was the lack of graphical options. The game was pretty and ran very good, but like most PC gamers I'd at least like the option to view the game optimally from my machine, which differs from other machines. Especially in a game that offers a lot of story and thus quite a few cutscenes. Still, some of the setpieces were fantastic.\n\nThe only other complaint I can offer was that this was not a very long game. With only something of three to four hours and a replayability of nill (it is an adventure game, after all), this is rather limited. But the story was finished and the last thing this game needed was unnecessary padding.\nIf you are looking for a good value:time ratio I'd say that anything lower than $/£/€5.00 is a steal, 7.50 seems fair, 10 is the very upper limit. But this is something everyone has to decide for themselves, of course.\n\nAnyway, this game comes highly recommended, enjoy!","February 16, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You expect to see a comedy with funny faces, but instead get an attempt at psychological horror and, as a result, feel confused.\nThe story, however, is surprisingly thrilling and intriguing, and the plot twists are shocking indeed, so this game is anything but boring. Besides, it's also quite short and the puzzles are not too tiring. Nice game, definitely nice one.","March 27, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The quasi-cel shaded characters, in true Pendulo tradition, are expertly crafted.  The backgrounds look great, running the gamut from super-detailed (the antique book shop) to impressionistic (the mystical Himalayan temple), depending on the mood.  The in-game animations are brief and subtle, full of rapid cuts, dramatic freeze frames, and often taking place within comic book panels.  Just reading this, you may think that this animation style sounds cheap -- in actuality it makes the game feel like an electric combo of thriller film and fast-paced graphic novel.  The narrative involves dark magic, torture, serial killers and a centuries-old Satanic cult.  While all of these elements have been used countless times before, Yesterday handles them with real style, assembling them into a highly engaging story with some very unique twists (this coming from a guy who has read a lot of fiction about this type of thing).  The puzzles may be simpler than in some of the past Pendulo games, but they aren't exactly easy unless you turn lousy cheater and invoke the hint feature.  DON'T INVOKE THE HINT FEATURE!  The game will last longer and be far more satisfying if you don't!\n\nFor my money, this game is definitely worth the full price.  If you are still on the fence about it, it's constantly on sale for 4 bucks or less, and that is a true steal for what you are getting.","January 3, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Given just how short it is, I recommend getting it at sale price.\n\nIt's a very worthwhile game to play. Intriguing story, very interesting characters, and just a weird trip overall. Very nice for beginning adventure gamers or someone who wants story-driven without being too complicated. The help system is extremely useful for those who are like me and fail at puzzles more often than not. The hotspots revealer is also extremely useful. Make sure to investigate everything, there's some very witty commentary tucked in some texts.\n\nBe aware that the talking animations are.... weird, I found them sort of distracting. But everything else about the game made up for this minor issue.

The puzzles are very logical, but still require you to put some effort into things. Every level is a gem and you'll feel happy when you finish it. None of the puzzles require you to take any notes or use items in ways you'd never imagine them being used. This game is really more geared for when you just want to play a short game and not bother with too much hassle, it's a casual game.\n\nThe story offers you a nice little mystery of which I won't tell you anything in order not to spoil anything. It won't leave you reeling with any great revelations, but you are offered some interesting characters and situations and sometimes things do turn out just that little bit different from what you were expecting.\nThe themes can a bit heavy even though nothing too gruesome is shown, but I would recommend that players at least be teens before trying out this little gem.\n\nThe voice acting in this game was sublime, the voice actors really did a good job.\nWhat I did not like about the game was the lack of graphical options. The game was pretty and ran very good, but like most PC gamers I'd at least like the option to view the game optimally from my machine, which differs from other machines. Especially in a game that offers a lot of story and thus quite a few cutscenes. Still, some of the setpieces were fantastic.\n\nThe only other complaint I can offer was that this was not a very long game. With only something of three to four hours and a replayability of nill (it is an adventure game, after all), this is rather limited. But the story was finished and the last thing this game needed was unnecessary padding.\nIf you are looking for a good value:time ratio I'd say that anything lower than $/£/€5.00 is a steal, 7.50 seems fair, 10 is the very upper limit. But this is something everyone has to decide for themselves, of course.\n\nAnyway, this game comes highly recommended, enjoy!","February 16, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is all over the place, I had a hard time following it, or taking interest in it. Characters are easily forgettable, the game takes turns in dumping you the plot, then has nothing happening for the next hour. The graphics are really weird, the atmosphere is beautiful, like in most Pendulo games, but the character sprites feel out of place, like you are playing the Runaway characters in a Chzo's Mythos game. Not taking anything away from the overall presentation, which is nice, but little tidbits like that sometimes break immersion in the worst places. The mechanics in the game are brilliant - your character doesn't waddle around the screen, instead it fades out of its position and quickly fades in near the spot you have clicked, which speeds up the gameplay. The game is EASY, puzzles are intuitive, some repeat themselves one too many times, you might find the occasional cheap hard to find puzzles here and there, especially towards the end, which still make no sense, but overall the game doesn't really challenge your adventure gaming skills.\n\nI feel like Pendulo tried to make a short and fresh new game with a compelling story worth your time and witty puzzles, and they have kinda did some stuff right, but ultimately - the desired result wasn't achieved. A solid 5-6/10 in my opinion.\n\nPut it like this - if you are a hardcore point-and-click adventure game fan and if you find the game in a sale or in a bundle - buy it, you won't regret it. It's not worth the 10 bucks it asks for currently, but if you can get it for cheaper, try it out.","May 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Flat characters are dragged along with the plot, having no apparent agency of their own.

I guess it's important to mention that the game is quite short and better to be played in German than in English, because there is no narrator in the English version, but in the German one. It just feels better with a narrator.\nIt is nice for fans of the other games of Pendulo Studios because of the references to its previous games.

I am just going to be up front about this, but it's not that I hate point and click adventure games. I just hate ones that go the monkey island route or w/e. I was kind of sold on the original idea since I thought this would follow a point and click adventure mentality like the early clock tower series games did. I LOVED that series. It just takes me out of the experience when the solutions to some of the puzzles in this game are so far left field that it completely draws me out of the experience. Half of the appeal is  figuring out the puzzles by yourself, but when you get stumped cause you tried every waking thing, only to find out the solution is something beyond reasonable thought then you just encounter puzzle game padding for the sake of padding. That's not the way to go. It should never be the way to go with these games.\n\nAsking $19.99 for this is WAY too much. My advice, is wait for this game to go on sale like I did, and just pick it up then. They also tend to sell all their games in a package deal for a really reasonable price. I have been told their other games are better, so maybe I will just chalk it up to a bad experience.\n\nWITH ALL THAT SAID, understand this: it's a solid point and click adventure game. Just go in expecting monkey island and not clock tower like I was. Half of the negativity is coming from failed expectations, but that's mainly on me. If you like games like monkey island, give this a try, but ONLY once it goes on sale. This 4-6 hour adventure is not worth the $19.99 asking price.\n\nSorry Pendulo. Maybe next time.\n\n","December 9, 2013","false","4.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I dont often post these but i feel this needs to be highlighted.\n\nThis game is riddled with Satanism, which is obvious from the first cutscene, pretty much every character turns out to be a cultist (Spoilers sorry) First I will point out some highlights; The art style is really nice, the 2 Dimensional environments are so unique, and the Simple yet clean 3D aspects are a nice touch. The puzzles are greatfun and really get you thinking.\nAlthough there are a few alternate endings the game is very linear, as you could expect in a point and click adventure.\n\nNow for the Negatives; The voice acting is pretty average, the main character has little to no emotional dialogue and facial expressions and the writers have awkwardly placed an attempt on humour randomly through the plot, which is at no point humerous unless your childish or immature.\nWorst part of all is the Satanism overload throuout the game, now Im into a little conspiracy every now and again, but this entire game felt like a recuitment plan to get me to pray to satan. Most of the puzzles are performing ritualistic events and the plot makes it seem like there is satanism in everything.\n\nHonestly its a game that you will get more or less absorbed in, that is why I want you to make wise choices as to whether you will go forth into this adventure for a brief brain straining game, but suffer the consequences of knowing things you really dont need in your sub-concieous.\n\nIf you are a parent, simply put, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, younger people are more likely to pick up small things from these types of media that will stick with them, its not worth it. You want a puzzle game, there are plenty of great ones out there that have no mindwashing elements within it.\n\nThanks for reading","November 9, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"

When the ending came I was left blinking at the screen in disbelief. For most games the time I spent would be the warm up period but no in this game it is the total length. I am rarely moved to write a negative review but here I go.\n\n\nThe Writing.\nThe writing is evidently rushed with scant room for character development. For the beginning/middle/end of the game you're left going "Alright then, room for the story to expand". This would be your first mistake. You see in this game what passes for intrigue is the writer going "Well, that certainly looks like something which could become interesting and exciting at some point in the futu-" at this point the writer walks off leaving his five year old son in his place to fill in the gaps. In crayon.\n\nThe Graphics.\nAlot of adventure games stick with 2D. Noone holds this against them but when an adventure game goes "♥♥♥♥ that, we're doing abit of 3D." you tend to prepare for something special. This would be your second mistake. You see while there may be some okish 3D *models* involved it actually turns out to be abit of a freak occurance when they move in the cinematics. Sometimes you'll get a talking head but when the artist feels particularly generous he'll show you a bunch of still-images in a very slow flick book kind of fashion. At least your character walks to where you click. Sometimes.\n\nAnyway. If this is on sale and you don't particularly value your money? Go nuts for donuts. Otherwise, look elsewhere.\n\n\n\n","October 13, 2014","false","3.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

It's different from others in its genre:  it's very dark  and has some unexpected plot twists.  I was struck by the higher quality of writing in this game than in previous projects by its studio like the Runaway series.  There's less corny dialogue and characters awkwardly talking out loud to themselves.  It's not quite as tight as their later venture, The Next Big Thing, which I'd recommend over this one, but if you like games in this genre aimed at adults (this is NOT a point & click game for kids in the slightest--way too dark with satanic cults involved), you will very likely enjoy this one.  It has four different endings, one of which is meant to be funny and involves some Easter Eggs if you played other games by Pendulo.\n\nThe good:\nThe plot is well done and moves at a good pace.  It will not always make sense your first hour into it, but that is intentional.  It works well like an average mystery-horor novel.  It won't blow you out of the water, but it's better than most.  The inventory system is easy to use, and I think the best of Pendulo's work.  The voice acting works: the characters seem to talk when it's logical and there's little inner monologue .  The hint system is well designed.\n\nThe neutral:\nWhile not often, a few puzzles feel like make-work, but they aren't too bad.  As some of the character's inner natures aren't revealed until the end, you may not grow attached to them.  People are sharply divided over the quality of some of the endings, but it bothered me less than most, I think.  The game clocked in at 5.4 hours for me on my first playthrough, mostly in two sittings.\n\nThe Poor:\nYou sometimes get this feeling like this game could be a bit more than it is.  It works where it needs to work, but it's not genre-defining or a favorite game.  I got it cheap on a bundle Pendulo sale, and it was worth that price, probably the 2nd best Pendulo game of the four in the bundle that I have played. Some characters are poorly developed leaving a few loose ends to the story that seem odd but don't warrant a sequel (the master, Boris, etc.).  Two sets of characters just seem so stereoptypical to be off-putting: the American tourists and the French concierge.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a solid game that if you like this genre you will probably mostly enjoy.  You probably won't brag about it with friends, or hope for a sequel. You'll enjoy solving some puzzles and seeing where it goes.  It is what it mostly presents itself to be and nothing more.  Get it on sale. It's not for kids and it's really dark--just be ready for that if that bothers you.\n\n","December 1, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They've made some other great games of the same style such as The next Big Thing. This studio is a true gem because it took everything the oldschool Telltale games had and modernized it. Here you'll see challenging puzzles, a great story and so much more. Honestly it will remind of Sam and Max, Grimfandango and the Broken Sword series. The story could be categorized as a horror, but with a humorous twist. The setting tends to be eerie but the dialog and the funny characters give the game a charm unlike any other.\n\nBear in mind the options menu is non existent, the graphics/textures could be a lot better, there isn't a functional menu to the game and while voice acting is very good in my personal opinion some voice actors make some characters very stale and boring which could be better.\n\nGoogling isn't really neccessary anymore because there's a hint mechanic in the game that will help you if you get stuck although you won't be able to bash it constantly.\n\nIf you like oldschool point and clicks where sometimes you'll bash your head against a table because you won't be able to figure out how to get to the next scene, and when you finally make it won't believe how stupid you were this is the game for you.\n\nA must buy for all you point and click enthusiasts especially now when it's dirt cheap on sale.","September 6, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charoum/recommended/205840/","charoum","Charoum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charoum/","257 products in account","In theory, I should like this game... I like adventure games, I like puzzles, and I like supernatural stories.  However, this game seemed to fall flat on every front, and is exceptionally short as well.  Once the story plot gets revealed more, it felt like that should be just the prologue - they could have done so much more with it.  The hermit/monk sequence and overarching plot left me yearning to play through some more flashback scenarios around when the character[s] developed originally to unlock other game mechanics that change things up as you learned about them... but they left that mostly unexplored.\n\nOn the puzzle front, there were a couple parts in which it felt like I was accomplishing something, but by and large the puzzles weren't that puzzling or satisfying.  The worst kind of puzzles are the obvious ones or the ones that just leave you trying different things ... and Yesterday primarily had those two kinds.  Consequentially, there either wasn't too much of an 'aha' moment, or that special moment when you eventually figure things out may be marred with a 'no way' moment that makes you question whether that is really practical and saps the fun out of it.\n\nIf the game goes on sale for a few bucks, I think it might still be worth it for adventure game fans... but in general I can't recommend it unless you are really looking for something quick and different to change things up for a few hours (it took me about 4-ish hours).  On the plus side, the art is quite well done and charming, but something a little grittier and less cartoony might have been more well-suited to its darker theme.  It's very similar to the Runaway games and The Next Big Thing on the art direction front... but one size doesn't always fit all.","December 22, 2013","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It didn't bog down or get boring.","May 26","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
