I had to rewatch it just to be allowed to write this review because you need to have used a product for more than 5 minutes before being able to write reviews.

Thats how long I've played the game in my first 48 hours of buying it. It's wonderful.\n\nThe storyline and progressive character development makes you feel warm and happy with each action you take. This goes beyond just the realm of farming. Stardew valley is a farming, rpg, simulation, and romantic game that takes you on a journey to see another side of life.\n\nAbsolutely recommend it to anyone. I didn't think it would suit me because it was "just another farm game" but it turned out to be one of the most heart warming, stimulitive games I've ever played.","May 31","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
