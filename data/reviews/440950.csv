"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095270695/recommended/440950/","76561198095270695","DarkReapersGrim","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095270695/","25 products in account","Firstly, keeping in mind that this is only a $5 game and the reminder that appears every time you begin the game that only two people worked on it, I won't tear too much into it, but I want to give a few words of advice for the future in case they decide to patch it up or make a sequel.\n\n1) Hunger-In the game, you get hungry (as any real survivor simulator) the meter goes from 0 (not hungry) to 100 (hungry). Solution: It makes more sense/logical to have it go the opposite direction from 100 (full) to 0 (hungry).\n\n2) Debuffs/Icons/Text/Guide-Also, there are debuffs in the game with icons (there's a bleeding icon, a headaches/migraines icon, a scared icon, etc.) but I couldn't find a guide that clearly indicated what these icons meant, you had to figure it out for yourself. I bring this up because when you're trying to treat a debuff/ailment with food or medicine, it does show you the icon of what the food/medicine treats, but it doesn't tell you in text what it treats or what it means. Solution: Have a page or simply indicate in text what the buffs/debuffs are and what the foods/medicine treats.\n\n3) Water-You can't drink tap water from the sink because the game tells you that the government advised against it because its toxic (even though you can still drink "dirty (bottled) water" which raises your toxicity levels like in Fallout 3. So your other options are a) find dirty bottled water with toxicity and drink that, b) find (fresh) bottled water and c) drink from a water cooler. When I tried to refill my water bottles from the water cooler, it said I needed empty water bottles despite having empty water bottles in my inventory after using/drinking the bottled water. Solution: Be able to use the empty water bottles that you finished drinking from, to refill water from the water cooler. Also, be able to drink and refill from the sink water, just like in Fallout 3. If toxicity levels go up, that's ok, that's what the medicine is for.\n\n4) Dark/Night time-There's day, afternoon and night time. You can hit a button to tell you the time of day it is. Problem is when it's night time, it's almost too dark to see what's going on. I tried adjusting my computer's settings and even the color settings in the game and it was still a little too dark to see. Solution: Lighten the night/dark so people can see what's happening more clearly. You can still indicate to the player that it's night time without having the screen be so dark.\n\nNote: The first two are very minor things in the game, but none of these make the game unplayable, even together. I beat the game in about 8 1/2 hours, taking my time, not even rushing it.  To be honest, I thought it was going to be longer, but I was left entertained after all of it was over. And the music, for a game like this, is really good. To me, it was on the level of Resident Evil for Nintendo 64. Was it worth my $5? Overall, I say it was worth $5. No regrets.","April 15","true","8.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Which is kind of sad because otherwise I would have loved it.\n\n-You get an advanced recipes guilde but no one with the skill to use it. Or maybe anyone can use it and it just containts nothing.\n-You get another crafting guide at the end of the game without any opportunity to use it\n-There is a forest it seems you can never enter at the start of the game\n-There are streets and passageways you cant enter closer to the end of the game\n-Sometimes when you enter one building you exit another,  Sometimes it says "you cant enter this building" but you do.  Then exit another building.\n-The improvised explosive you can make you cant use.\n-There's only one door to lockpick and I'm not even sure you need lockpick for it.\n-Never found a hammer to make nailbat because all drops are random it seems and its possible to go the entire game without getting certain items vital to crafting.\n-Only 2 places you can light fires to cook, one is lost to you shortly after getting it.\n-Item cap is 30 which is frustratingly low for ammo.\n-Ranged weapons dont have knockback so if you cant kill the zombies in one hit they'll likely hit you.\n-Non Knife/machette weapons cant be swung very fast so they're useless and invovle you hitting them once and them hitting you with the slough of potential negative side effects.  Found a box of unlimited bats (not as helpful as one might think because of the previous).\n-Never found a rifle for it being the one dude's special talent.  There are skills you can equip that say "melee skill" and "pistol skills" which dont seem to do anything.\n-There is no stamina bar so you cant tell how long you should wait before trying to sprint again (its kind of like a secret of evermore system where you can keep hitting it and getting baby sprints which aren't helpful).\nThere is no hunger/thirst bar so you just start taking damage and you're 10 steps in before you realize that's what's happening.\n-Skills cost 50-100 out of 100 of your skill points so they're almost useless as you can only use them once or twice\n-They both highlight the loot spots you can use 1-4 times and have unnoticable other loot spots you can use once for loot which are easy to miss\n-Entire game takes a couple hours\n-One event gives you a destination after a mysterious event and no real explanation as to why you're going there\n-The "you didn't find anything" bar that pops up takes 10 times longer to fade than the one when you get an item which makes getting nothing 4 times in a row incredibly frustrating on multiple levels\n-At one point in the game I lost a significant amount of my loot, which I thought was because of an event, but it was bizaire I didn't lose all of it, or lost all of it and get it all back.  I just lost some of it.\n-very choppy at times\n-Every time you enter an area it seems to start daytime and immediately plummet into darkness\n-You cant really free range on the world map and go where you want, you have to exit through a specific exit of a specific area which gives you a pipeline to one area (the next area) while at the same time labelling some areas as "you cant re enter here" and I'm not sure why they couldn't just give you free range movement on the map and just label the forbidden zones as "you may not enter" areas.  It makes it frustratingly difficult to move long distances.\n-its also plain frustrating it doesn't let you re enter the plot closed areas.  Let me foolishly fight the horde by hucking grenades at them.  Let me go back in that house.  Dont just systematically close every area of your already short game.\n-the flash light is really misaligned which is kind of useless, you can see what's ahead and beside you, parallel to your pathway but not what's directly ahead of you.\n\nJust a lot of bugs  that they probably could have seen with one playthrough and really should have fixed","April 29","false","8.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/440950/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Story of the Survivor is made by two people, Kamil Szczepanik and Bartosz Zajkowski with a passion for video games who wanted to partner together to create a passion project. The game draws its inspiration from The Walking Dead games and television shows. I know what you’re thinking, ‘another zombie game made by newbie video game developers’ but this one may in fact be well worth checking out especially if you’re not someone who is instantly put off by the RPGMaker engine.\n\nThe story begins relatively slowly as many RPGMaker games have a tendency of doing. However, what is immediately clear between the art assets both created and selected from those already made and the game’s soundtrack is that the developers have established the necessary tone and the aesthetic required to immerse players into their elaborate game world. As the story gains pace  so too does the tremendous action. Although I have not reached what I am certain is going to be a mildly interesting conclusion it has been a very reasonably written one as far as RPGMaker games go and one that serves its inspirations well. The story does a solid job of conveying the feelings and emotions of a world in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.\n\nI enjoyed the crafting aspect of the game which is available from very early on in the game. It is something that you will need to be constantly thoughtful of as some of the items that are available to be made from your crafting items can play important, if not vital, roles in progressing further into the game.\n\nI know that there are perfectionists among us so if I was to pick out a negative it would be that the English isn’t the very best. However, in my time with the game I found it to be definitely passable. There weren’t any sections of the text that I felt as though I couldn’t understand what was being conveyed. There’s a few words here and there that I feel are incorrect. However, keep in mind how far traveled the language has become and the different ways in which people speak it and I’m not merely talking the difference between American and British English here. I find it interesting listening to someone from Europe speak English with someone from Southern Africa for example. At times it can seem as though they are speaking two very different languages yet all of the worlds are noticeably English. The dialects of the language are fascinating and so what the writers may have implied may be purely correct from one perspective and not from another. There’s only very few misspellings.\n\nWould I recommend Story of the Survivor? As the devs themselves wrote in their Steam Description, if you’re a fan of The Walking Dead or other zombie-related media, then is the game for you!\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","1.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Surviving isn't going to be easy, and zombies aren't the only things to worry about. You must also eat and drink to survive as well as avoid other survivors." - Creators of Story Of The Survivor\n\nFirst you play as Thomas. He is a young teenager that lives with his mom. However, a zombie apocalypse wipes out the world but a few survivors, one being you. You are locked up in your house for a month in fear zombies will eat you to death, and you notice your food and your water supplies going lower and lower for each pasting day. After understanding your mom is so sick she is at the point of dieing, you seek medical help from a nearby town yet knowing there won't be any help, only zombies and blood. There you will face countless zombies and soon, understanding you won't make it alone...\n\nStory Of The Survivor was made by two people, where I got to met one of the developers. I must say, for a team of two, they really outdone what they could do. Considering this being their first game, and a team of two with no background, it's really good!\n\nPros  Long story!\nHP and Mana system!\nTons of different items!\nDifferent characters!\nGood graphics! (for a RPG)\nCheap!\nSave function which allows up to 4 individual saves files!\nGreat music! Cons  No achievements or trading cards!\nZombies!\nYet more zombies, I wonder why!\nBlood... Conclusion\nLove RPGS and games styled with zombies and blood? Then you should get Story Of The Survivor!\n\nOverall Rating: 7.5/10\n\nMy Group's Curator Page!","March 6","true","2.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikhagaming/recommended/440950/","Mikhagaming","M1kha【USG-Curator】","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikhagaming/","147 products in account","A simple but pretty well done indie game\nYou play as Thomas when you start out in this post apocalyptic world.\nThe world has gone to hell but you and your mother are still alive. for now that is.\nAs the game progresses you find more locations. You have to survive the zombie infested world by crafting everything you need for your journey, You also must avoid other survivers and lookout for food and drinks to help you survive.\nKeep in mind that this game is developed by 2 guys.\n\n\nGameplay and Story\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. Troughout your journey you stab, shoot and avoid other people depending on what you choose. Since it is developed by 2 guys using RPGmaker dont expect anything fancy of the gameplay. It is simple but it works for the world they have built using already created items by others but also adding to that by adding asthetics and items that bring the player more into the world they have created. The soundtrack really does fit the atmosphere they were going for. The crafting aspect of the game is also good enough to keep you involved.\n\nAs far as the story goes. There is no voiceacting involved but the story does a good job of pulling the player into the midst of this zombie infested world. The story starts of slow but when you keep playing you find out that it leaves the slow story telling behind and puts you into way more action than you find in the first hour or so. I will not spoil anything but the 2 developers did a pretty decent job writing a good story and making the game with RPGmaker.\n\nPROS\nCrafting system with enough variation in items to craft\nGives you enough room to explore around town to gather supplies\nCombat using knives and guns is effective and simple\nThe music used in the different locations fits the atmosphere of a zombie invested world\nSo far an intresting story\nFor a game made with RPG maker they have done a excellent job\nCONS\nThe sounds when you go from outside to inside a building is annoying after a while\nWhen you get hit it looks like your character freezes for a couple of seconds\nminor bugs (keys not responding, the menu does not always respond) annoying little things but nothing that gamebreaking honestly\nOVERALL THOUGHTS & CONCLUSION\n\nOverall I was quite supriesed by what the 2 developers brought us with RPG maker, I have not reached the end yet but so far so good. It runs well and it plays well. To keep it short. In my opinion it is well worth the pricetag of $5. It offers enough playtime and content for that price and overall it is a decent game.\nFinal Verdict: a 7/10","April 30","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
