"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/recommended/283060/","amaimagi","amaimagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/","309 products in account","TLDR; While this game is undeniably old, thus the dated graphics, but I still think it's a pretty cool game to dive in.\n\nNote: This review was done during my experience with the early game life within Lucent Heart, and is subjected to change in the near future when I reaches the later game contents.\n\nI've played quite a bit back when the game was handled by a different company. I took a long hiatus from the game then and now I'm onto a fresh start all over again from level 1. It's been quite a while since I last played this, so I've forgotten lots of basic knowledge of the game, therefore I'm no different than any other regular newbies.\n\nWhen you first login into the world, you'll be welcomed by the rather dated graphics. Since this game was released more than 5+ years ago, this is quite understandable. The day and night cycles are implimented and some monsters were supposedly appear during a certain time (which is a pretty neat feature imo).\n\nThe community so far as I've experienced was very friendly and welcoming. Although there were very much afkers hanging around in town, when you asked for help, a lot of people were eager to offer their knowledge of the game which put a smile on my face.\n\nI enjoy playing solo most of the time in MMOs, while sometimes I do find myself participating a few dungeon runs here and there, if the game is possible to tackle alone, I much prefer it that way. That's being said, this game is certainly solo-friendly in the early game, and is very encouraging towards team work later on in game.\n\nThis game follows the same MMO formula as the others, the questing system is quite generic with the "go here, kill that, come back and return the quest to this npc" type and would probably be tiresome as this goes on, but since I'm a casual player, this doesn't concern me that much. Especially understanding that most MMOs were designed to be played that way anyways, and this game certainly tries its best to redeem itself with some fun events with mini DDR-like game (It was called Dance Masters, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.) and possibly upcoming trivia-type event for players to get involved in.\n\nSo, overall (as of now) I'm voting "yes" for recommending this game :)","February 11","true","30.8"," 150 of 202 people (74%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","74","150","202","16","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zackhario/recommended/283060/","Zackhario","Zackhario","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zackhario/","238 products in account","Lucent Heart, what can I say.\n\nFirst off, I'm one of the dedicated players who've been playing this for years and I am happy to see it on Steam. However, it didn't went on here without its struggles. Yes, it doesn't have the best graphics, best storyline or the best anything, but this is pretty old. And if you're like me, chances are, you love this game as much as the other player that you invested over thousands of hours into it. Which I did. I would say Lucent Heart is one of those games you played in your childhood and you simply fell in love with it, like Zelda or FF7, Lucent Heart gives off the same vibe and that's one of the charms of this game.\n\nLucent Heart is a classic anime MMORPG developed by a Taiwanese company called 'Playcoo' and it is staggeringly popular in Japan and other Asian countries, while it is not as popular in the West, it is alive and well through these years thanks to a hardcore fanbase and Subagames who've been running it. Lucent Heart not only offers such a unique storyline and visual design but is bundled with features. Unfortunately, not all of them are out yet because Lucent Heart is currently version 10.0, but regardless, it still have plenty to offer for the time being.\n\nFeatures\n\nLover System\nMany people have found their true love through this game, though i like to think it's not a dating game, the theme of this game suggest so. (Note: This game is not dedicated to romance stuff.) But people have met and even marry in RL. Good for them, but what about you, the reader? Well if you are interested, Lucent Heart have a system called Soulmate where you can sign up with Cupid NPC and find your, well, soulmate. And if you feel she/he's the right one for you, then you can marry in-game. And yes, you can marry same-sex user, hurray for equality! (In later version, you may able to create and raise a child regardless of your gender.)\n\nGvG/PvP\nI'm sure you know what these stand for. You can't have MMORPG without a little rivalry. And boy oh boy, you better be careful playing in these matches, it's pretty brutal. In GvG, guilds are challenged randomly by opponent guild according to the system and the Guilds' strength. And you play to win by most points from killing enemies or destroying their flags. Depending how the battle plays out, GvG has 3 rounds and occurs on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Very exciting. However, if you're in a mood for PvP, there is a channel 'Underworld - PvP' where you can freely kill players outside of the towns. Scary.\n\nHousing\nWhile I wouldn't say it's the best feature, you are given an house at lv25 and able to decorate your own place. And if you're brave enough, you can invade people's homes in acquire special items and points, as well as rating their home decoration.\n\nTransportation\nTransports is a must because Lucent Heart is big, pretty big. If you don't like walking all the way to your destination then you can always hop onto the Airship, there are five airships available to different stops and require no fees. Pretty sweet. But if you prefer riding mounts, keep on reading.\n\nMounts and Pets\nLucent got unicorns, carriage, lions, motorbikes, rhinos and even robots for mounts. It's quite a spectacle in the town, you'd be surprise how well they fit in. You also get support from your pets, or um.. *cough* slave http://puu.sh/n6H8U/f588594fe3.jpg http://puu.sh/n6HfN/208223361d.jpg Cute, aren't they? Ehehe..hehe Of course, this game also offers "pets" handsome guys.\n\nCharacter customisation\nFrom the start, you may think the character design choices are quite limited, which I agree. However, if you are patient and dive into the game and press B (which opens Item Mall.) You will find quite a lot of clothes, accessories and adjustments to design yourself. Personally, I love the butler set, fits me quite well I would say. But if you descend from the fires of hell, you can buy some flamboyant clothes or if you're a princess from uh- Wateverland, it got plenty of dresses to choose from. Honestly, this game have a few fashion diva and they take it to the max.\n\nClasses\nNaturally, you start out as a newbie who have yet chosen their class. Classes is consist of 4 classes, 8 advanced jobs, and have three transformations. You start out with a choice of two, Warrior or Mage. Then once you've done your part, the next transformation of class where you given an choice of two more classes and you keep on building up. Depending on the line of class (Check here for a map: http://puu.sh/n6Ig8/c782a0bdaa.png) There's also another class called Phantom Warlock, which is a shapeshifter class. Which I don't know much about but hey, it's pretty cool.\n\n\nGameplay\nYou can play Solo, by any means, but it is hard. Lucent Heart is hard. After all, the game is intended for grinding-lovers audience which they spend most of the time in. Strangely enough, it is addictive even if you're playing alone. Lucent Heart is a lot more fun when playing with your friends. You can party up to 6 members and there are plenty of deadly bosses out there to take on. The gameplay isn't exactly amazing but rather nostalgic, in terms of old gaming. Even if you're not in old games, do give this a try. It is a fantastic game, and I enjoy playing it a lot.\n\n\nOverall, the game is not without its flaws but nevertheless, amazing game and I'm happy to give it a long review. Annnnnd if you made it the end, pat yourself on the back for being a reasonable gamer and join me, to critically acclaimed game in its own era, the adventure of Lucent Heart.\n\nNote: I may update and correct mistakes on this review.","February 13","true","166.1"," 93 of 118 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","93","118","8","4"

It's a good game, but if you're a "hardcore" FPS (first-person shooter) player, this is probably just not your cuppa. This game centers mostly around community. No, it is NOT a "dating SIM", but there are undeniably strong elements in the game that require you to interact with other people. There is no "world" PvP in two of the three servers, and there is very little emphasis on it overall (aside from guild wars of course) that I have been able to find thus far. That's not to say there is nothing hardcore about this game, but it's not WoW or LoL. If you're looking for a good game to relax with that you will try to get into the community on, where the majority of the cash shop items are cosmetic and you can't just buy top tier armor on your first day in the game from it, then you might want to consider Lucent Heart.

Someone is always willing to help in chat. Lots of people running around, although that might be because this just released on Steam.\nHoroscope system: You gain stat boosts depending on your horoscope. From critical hit chance, to treasure finding, to love chance(?)\nCustomization: Large amount of fashion options for your character. From entire costume sets, to minions, to a wide variety of mounts.\n\nOpinion:\nI can say that I won't be playing this myself. I am not at all interested in a romance system and the community doesn't feel particularly exciting or different. However, if you're looking for an anime mmo with romancing features that isn't dead and doesn't require a good PC/Laptop to run properly.

I tried and didn't even make it through the first 3 monsters. a server with open world pvp that is connected to your character at pve server, which means one character can  join both pve and pvp server.)\nOk lets start with the pros\nPros:\n***DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION AND CAR RACING (Yes you can play DDR and pk other players and play mario kart)\nBright anime style graphics with the medieval-ish theme and yet with modern buildings and structures.\n*Zodiac systems with your own zodiac power and zodiac armor.(which is pretty cool actually, if you get to level 30)\nCupid Matching system, which will match you with players that you have common interests in or in the same level range.\nGMs are really active in the game( I mean like really active, you can strike a conversion with GM in zone chat and GM will talk if not busy.

The social aspect is amazing and I have nothing to complain about, but the combat just felt horrible. Most of the time I just found myself autorunning or killing monsters, it seemed to me as if there wasn't even other type of quest. Graphics are dated, although I never really judge a game by it and having that said, I think they're easy to get used to. The leveling is ultra-slow and entire process is just hardcore grind-fest. I don't have anything against that, but it just feels like game has not that much to offer in this department. I can't tell much about crafting/pvp, as I hasn't been introduced to it yet at all by quests.

I'd also think the horoscope motif shows promise.\n\nThat being said, it feels like I got into it too early. It doesn't have much substance and the small doses EXP you gain from battle make grinding extra tedius. The growing pains of a new game are also seen in the text. The game feels polished in the graphical department but dialogue and gameplay seem like they need to be focused on to keep this game afloat.\n\nI think that Lucent Heart has a lot of potential, it's just gotta work hard and develop its own style to make that happen. Hopefully within a year, it will provide something worth coming back to.","March 8","false","43.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

Once in the game, I was greeted with god-awful lag.\n\nTLDR; if you like laggy systems, repetitive music and god-awful sound, and empty areas, this is the game for you!\n\nI can't say anything positive about this game, so here's just all the bull that I was greeted with:\n\n1) Attributes are based on zodiac + blood type. ????? Well, a'ight, then. I guess, I mean??\n2) Miserable lag. (My computer can run other MMOs just fine, I don't know what this one's problem was)\n3) Empty area. Where was everyone? I called out into the abyss that I now call hell for a solid five minutes, walked around, it was empty. Just lonely NPCs begging for death. Well, they were probably begging for death. UPDATE: I logged back in, called out into the abyss again. A guy approached me. He was silent for a few minutes before he just disappeared (or I didn't see him run due to lag).\n4) I can't tell if the collision detection was bad or if it was just the lag ???\n5) Not many character creation options--hoo boy that was all grotesque. Same-face-same-body is what we're looking at here, folks.\n6) Hoo boy that noise was miserable, too. Repetitive. It didn't help that I could barely walk anywhere--so really I was stuck with the same flute sound effect, the same birds chirping, and the same BG music looping. At one point, everything stopped, and I silently hoped that the game crashed. It did not. Birds started chirping again, that god-awful flute and BG loop started again, and that weird water (???) noise picked back up.","February 15","false","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","5"

But what really annoyed me is how it would keep swiching out of the game to another window so I only knew what was gooing on half the time.  trying to attack one thing was not easy and it wasn't the fun kind of diffculty either.  Like I know battles in Tera are really hard but also really fun and satisfying. Still I know I it's not fair to compare this game to that game, as you could eaisly say they are in differnt "weight classes"  but still even compared to games like maplestory or Uncharted Watters which i think are at least closer to beeing in the same league they certianly pull of their games right from the getgo much better then what I saw of this one.  I'd say it's less of a time waster playing those games then this one.\n\nAlso the Area was complety empty no sign of other players at all, now I might of given them some credit for having a single player tutorial campagin but least give me some sign that there's other people on line, and it didn't seem like there was a story arc gooing on with the tutorial quests it was just a group of people who refered me to the next goup getting me slowly closer hopefully to a regular town.\n\nThe cash shop had a bunch of nice items in it, but they aren't cheap, while i don't think they are super expensive compared to the cash shop in other games I've played I think they are on the higher side of the average.\n\nSo while this isn't the worst game I've played, I've seen worse.

Nothing unique or clever about it, as near as I can tell. It's like a bad knock off of flyff.

With this, it's simply so bad that it's bad. It's genuinely complete garbage. I bought a $40 rice cooker that overheats when you cook rice with it and turns itself off. I am less disappointed in that than I am with this game, and I didn't even pay for it. It was literally not worth the time it took for me to download the 3.1 gigabytes that I can only assume was taken up by the intro cinematic, considering that all five assets in the game are used everywhere that I've seen.

It's the community and the memories that I'll forever keep close to myself, as they were an integral part to me getting through my teen years.\n\nAs well, I realize that this is another one of those games similar to those that wanted to capitalize on the "golden age of RO", when there were tons of MMORPGs similar to it (And that's in North America. There were a dime a dozen in Hong Kong and South Korea). And while it was released a few years ago, it's now on Steam, and has to compare to what we've got here in 2016. And unfortunately, it hasn't aged well.\n\nIf you want to play a free MMO, you're in luck because as of writing this in February of 2016, you're bound to find a hundred other free MMOs that far surpass this one in overall quality.\n\nBut if you're curious and wants to see what old 3D Korean Grindfests were like, feel free to jump in. It's free, after all. Unfortunately, expect the following:\n- A grindfest\n- A community that's close-knit, so it'll be difficult to get in on already-established ones.\n- A shallow, lackluster combat system\n- Graphics and sound that haven't aged well\n\nAs such, I can't recommend this game, as it's far past its prime.","February 14","false","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

THIS IS A FIGHTING GAME NOT A LOVE GAME oh and by the way i dont even think you can date in this game and if there is then why does it? this seems to be a messed up game if you ask me and besides this shouldint be a little bit of love in there it suppose to be all fighting not love oh and why do you even need a id to buy and view your inventory like why do you even need that fighting games shouldint have that ya know and dont ask me why they added an id because the company who made this game are rly stupid to see if this is how a fighting game is i bet they havent even played a fighting game before but i dont even know why they came up with this idea like rly and id to buy and look in your inventory like that doesent make sence oh and speaking oh and thats not all you cant run because the walking animation is the run so you dont need to do that but that spoils the fun here oh and dont blame me the walking animation being the running im just saying this because i played enough fighting online games this game is a game that literlly doesent make sence","February 29","true","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"

I'm not just talking about graphics. Honestly I could care less about that aspect. It's just about everything else. This game is pretty much just another skin of most point and clickers you'd seen the past decade but with sub-par UI with very little in game options to tweak that'd ease the pain.\nThe gimmick to this game is focused around p2p relations, but let's be honest. Your 'girlfriend' is Neck-beard Nelson and your boyfriend might actually be a hardened middleschooler who's seen some rough times at recess on the playground. There is actually very little communication in game unless you're a damsel in distress. Suddenly, those statues you seen in town you thought were afk come gravitating towards you. Put on your most kawaii face, you're about to hit the life of luxury if you play your cards right :3 <3\nLet's get real for a brief moment though and talk about the gameplay. You've seen it countless times. Click here, click there, grab this quest, click this monster, click that item. Done. However, with the choppiness of the game, you might find yourself stuck in an infinite loop of running in a line then warping back a few steps or getting stuck on ghost walls. As for npcs and their quests. My initial issue was with the tutorial npcs. The very first npc simply wants you to talk to him and then click the button that completes the quest and rewards you. However, no matter how many times i clicked complete, all i got was the jingle for the completed quest but it never completed.I could click that button as much as i wanted to, but i just got to hear sounds. Relogging didn't work. Reinstallation did, but i ran into the same issue with the following quests after that.\n\nNot even a desperate waifu hunting weeb can justify how bland and uninspired this game is. There was actually a point i felt like i was walking through a reskinned area within SilkRoad Online. It's bad news for this game when the tutorial npcs are bugging out and denying further questline progress. At the very least, such a low end mmo should be easy to manage and not give people grief with loading. High end computer or not, you're in for struggle when in town. Geeze, not even this game want's anything to do with itself.","February 11","false","0.2"," 77 of 197 people (39%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","39","77","197","32","5"

Something that I try to do for every game I come across and play. Lucent Heart at its core felt like something meant for people who play MMORPGs for their friends and not for incredible polish or tight systems. A few things you'll notice upon logging in both good and bad are:\n\nGraphics are outdated\nPlayerbase seems very small\nClient slow-down (this is one of the more grating aspects of this game)\nVery friendly GMs and players\n"Zone" or "Map" chat is almost always bustling\nZodiac System may be a bit confusing while creating your character. (For help with that: Zodiac System Guide [luheart.wikia.com])\nInventory will start filling almost immediately once you start questing\nLacking in variety for character creation\nLucent Heart was made with community and friendship and relationships in mind, that much is clear. This game thrives when you've found your stride with a guild or a group of people to hang out with and help. Much of the early game is severely lonely, and asking players in general chat will likely not net you much unless you are in town.\n\nFinal Word?\n\nIf you're into playing MMORPGs to make new interesting relationships with people online, this is your game. If you're into MMORPGs to get satisfaction of actually playing a game, this isn't for you.\n\nEven so, if you've nothing to do and you want to see what this is all about, it's more than worth giving it a shot. Its couple system is a bit janky, and you nearly never see your match online, but still there's something there for Lucent Heart that a lot of newer MMORPGs are missing. This was definitely crafted and is maintained by people who truly enjoy interaction with others with this game as a medium. That's probably the biggest compliment you could give this type of MMO in my book.\n\nHowever, if you do plan on spending money on this, I would caution that this game's in-steam cash shop costs MORE than just simply going through the subagames website.\n\nEither way, 17 hours in this game has netted me a few friends. Much more than I'd say for some of these newer MMORPGs coming out.","March 13","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few things you'll notice upon logging in both good and bad are:\n\nGraphics are outdated\nPlayerbase seems very small\nClient slow-down (this is one of the more grating aspects of this game)\nVery friendly GMs and players\n"Zone" or "Map" chat is almost always bustling\nZodiac System may be a bit confusing while creating your character. (For help with that: Zodiac System Guide [luheart.wikia.com])\nInventory will start filling almost immediately once you start questing\nLacking in variety for character creation\nLucent Heart was made with community and friendship and relationships in mind, that much is clear. This game thrives when you've found your stride with a guild or a group of people to hang out with and help. Much of the early game is severely lonely, and asking players in general chat will likely not net you much unless you are in town.\n\nFinal Word?\n\nIf you're into playing MMORPGs to make new interesting relationships with people online, this is your game. If you're into MMORPGs to get satisfaction of actually playing a game, this isn't for you.\n\nEven so, if you've nothing to do and you want to see what this is all about, it's more than worth giving it a shot. Its couple system is a bit janky, and you nearly never see your match online, but still there's something there for Lucent Heart that a lot of newer MMORPGs are missing. This was definitely crafted and is maintained by people who truly enjoy interaction with others with this game as a medium. That's probably the biggest compliment you could give this type of MMO in my book.\n\nHowever, if you do plan on spending money on this, I would caution that this game's in-steam cash shop costs MORE than just simply going through the subagames website.\n\nEither way, 17 hours in this game has netted me a few friends. Much more than I'd say for some of these newer MMORPGs coming out.","March 13","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, the graphics could be updated, but its your typical fighting game with interacting with other players involved. Its a really cool game and keep in mind\nIT IS FREE\nDON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS ON A FREE GAME UNLESS THEY CAN BUILD OFF IT.\nok thanks","March 14","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
