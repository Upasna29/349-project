"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/207040/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","SIne Mora is a rare game of it’s kind. In a generation overwhelmed by FPSes and RPGs it's very hard to make a good Shoot 'em Up which appeals to both fans of the genre and one-time players. The developers tried to make a game that balances between casual and hardcore shmup game experience. How they managed it, is a matter of an other question.\n\nYes, you can pick up Sine Mora and play it without having played any shmups ever before. And yes, you can have fun with it if you are a veteran player. Sadly, you can side in either of the two groups, the fun will start to fade away quite quickly. The game tries to please both sides at the same time which, in some cases is impossible. Sometimes it tries to cut corners with inconsistent bullet pattern and difficult hit detection to please the casual fan base, in other times it gets so difficult that a one-time player will probably quit after a couple of fails. It's a balance often Sine Mora just can't get right.\n\nThe game introduces an interesting time based mechanism. You and your planes don't have any health; instead you get a time meter constantly counting down. Once it hits zero, you are dead. To keep the meter running you have to shoot down enemy planes and vehicles which will add time to the counter. It's really interesting and the devs should be praised for coming up with this unique approach which actually works really well.\n\nThe story is something that bugs me. Sine Mora introduces a world, background story, multiple timelines and several characters that would be too much even for a game with a dozen-hour length of game play. But no, our game’s campaign lasts around 2 to 3 hours (!), which is frankly, disappointing. You will never get the idea of the story as it's overly complicated for a game of this magnitude. To make the matter worse, different characters are introduced every 20 minutes and that's where you lose any interest of understanding the underlying story. Just give me the next Boss and let's get on with it! And the game does. There are huge boss battles in every 15 minutes, which on normal are pieces of cakes, but on harder difficulty give players a hell lot of trouble.\n\nIf there's one thing in which the game excels it's the graphics department. It looks absolutely astonishingly beautiful, for its genre it is over the top. The environment is colorful, detailed and alive. Levels are varied and vivid, and you have to really look hard for graphic letdowns in the game. Audio-wise the game keeps up the pace with an excellently composed soundtrack that is worth listening to. The sound effects sometimes feel weird and weak, but you can get used to it. The voice over is where the game really lets us down. For one thing, there's no English voice track. For whatever reason the devs decided to include only the original, Hungarian voice over. For those who can't speak the language, you won't miss a thing. Voice actors feel unmotivated and rather reading than acting their scripts. Also, it is littered with Hungarian trash language that sometimes feel uncomfortably awkward.\n\nAfter breezing through the short and puzzled campaign for a casual gamer there's sadly not much to do further. All the other game modes where you can change your planes and pilots are for veteran and experienced shmup players. If you are a one time player you can give it a shot, but be prepared to fail many times. Some of the bosses and levels can get so difficult that it will frustrate even the most talented players. And this isn't because of the lack of skills from the player, but rather the aforementioned flaws: inconsistent bullet patterns and odd hit detection.\n\nSine Mora tries so hard to please everyone that it fails to please many. Every gamer hard-core shmup player or casual can have a shot at this beautifully confusing piece, but after a couple of hours we move on with ambiguous feelings.\n\nRating: 61/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 2.5 hours (campaign); Played on: normal.\n","October 15, 2013","true","2.8"," 51 of 66 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","51","66","0","1"

I guess Sine Mora is one of the first indie games they have developed so far - an attempt at something different with lower production costs and a now not very common genre.\n\nDo note that this game is very difficult! Even on normal difficulty setting it is easy to perish and boss battles do not make it easier. There is a constant swarm of enemies and as typical of the genre the longer you survive without being hit the stronger you can become by picking up all the various power-ups lying about.\n\nGraphics are decent and there are cutscenes incorporated in the narrative that make the game look even more fantastic. I liked how the camera focused on the plane as we were transitioning from one place to another. The story takes place in a fictitious world and it is a tale of, mainly, revenge. Its steampunk approach renders it a unique atmosphere - even more interesting is the Hungarian audio that - per default - you will hear.\n\nGreater difficulty levels and various story modes available make Sine Mora a long-lasting experience. If you like the genre and you are in for some challenge pick this one up","November 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

If you just want a retro pew pew game and don't care about anything beyond that, than it works. But if you actually care about things like good gameplay mechanics, depth, level design, etc. than spend your hard earned time and money on a more deserving shmup, because you won't find those things here.\n\nBaffling design decisions abound here:\n\n\n-Scoring is random (let me repeat that: RANDOMIZED SCORING IN A SHMUP) due to randomized item drops. Scoring adds a competitive aspect to most shmups, and with broken scoring a large amount of the games potential replay value is gone.\n\n-the scoring system encourages you not to use the time powers that define the game. Many excellent shmups over the years like Rayforce or Esp Galuda have incorporated their major abilities and mechanics into the scoring systems to add depth and risk/reward to how you use these abilties, but by punishing you for using your powers, this game essentially encourages you to play in the most boring way possible.\n\n- there are slow dense bullet patterns but there's no button to slow your movement like every bullet hell game ever (apparently the lead designer thought having the option to change speed would be "too hardcore"...What? Why did you put those patterns in than?). A fast move speed might work for a shmup where the patterns are designed around it, but many of the patterns here just feel unnecessarily uncomfortable.\n\n- The level design, pacing, and difficulty balance is wonky as hell. The levels in particular can often be very slow and repetitive. They also have a bad habit of covering up holes and empty spots in the levels pacing with cut scenes, of all things.\n\n- many of the games gimmicks and "innovations" are poorly implemented (the time control abilities that force you to look at the other side of the screen away from enemy bullets, for instance. No real excuse since Esp Galuda used the same exact mechanic years earlier but got it right by putting the meter around your ship.),\n\n- the health system only succeeds in forcing you to die 10 seconds after you make a mistake rather than right away.\n\n\nAlso the story is tryhard as ♥♥♥♥. Apparently the characters were originally going to be humans but someone at Grasshopper said it wasn't "zany" enough. Yes, that's what we need in our fatalistic time travel story about genocide, patricide, ♥♥♥♥, and despair: Zaniness.\n\nIf you like the game that's cool, but from a design standpoint I'd only put it slightly above some of the worse doujin/indie shmups out there.","February 1, 2014","false","2.0"," 121 of 202 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","121","202","0","24"

Gameplay is fantastic, can be played multiple times just to reach top scores in leader boards (I'm not good at it, but it is an option if you are a competitive person). There is no life meter, only time, one of the most innovative mechanics I've seen in a game (Shoot 'Em Up games are pretty conservative).

Most people will just skip these parts, but folks who take the time (like me) to read through will be left disappointed.  It isn't even that the story is particularly bad, it just isn't given the attention it deserves.\n-There is a very challenging portion of the game, and if you manage to beat it your character is instantly and unavoidably killed.  It's enough to make you throw your controller.\n-It is sometimes unclear what hit your ship or how you died... not a problem for completing the game on easy mode (you have lots of health) but really terrible if you want to spend the time to truly master the game.\n-I experienced some graphicals glitches putting black boxes across parts of the backround.  The game is otherwise so beautifully made, it was dissapointing.\n-3d is not used very well.  Without true depth perception, it is very difficult to see what is in your pane of existence.\n-Random powerups and score system?  Really?  This fact alone completely changes every level every time you play it, and most of the time for the worse.","April 9, 2015","false","3.1"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","0"

A train immediately comes out of nowhere and smashes into you, killing you instantly. You restart, and this time you're expecting it so you move up and get instakilled by the ceiling supports that look like they're part of the background.

Are they nerfing shmups to accommodate a broader audience now, too? Well, yes and no. Thank goodness for difficulty modes.\n\nWhile I certainly enjoy shmups, I'm not especially great at them. The story mode of this game was not what I would call easy, but the game is only around an hour long and I was able to get through it after about 20 attempts. The game has great environments, interesting bosses, and incredible eye candy. Your ship's health is tied to a countdown timer and this mechanic works exceedingly well. So does the limited slow-down mechanic that can be rationed out judiciously throughout each level. All of this adds up to a very fun experience. Too bad it was so short-lived.\n\nBut wait! What's this "Arcade" mode all about? I get to choose my plane, my pilot, and my special ability? And there's more difficulty options here too: "Hard" and "Insane." Joy!

Overly ambitious. Glorious tech. Crazy storyline. Interesting score-system. Plenty of features. I really wanted to like and enjoy this - and at times I think I did. However, at the end of the day Sine Mora is lost in it's ambitions failing at the most trivial things. Things so essential to this particular type of game that you wonder how they could screw up things so badly. Considering this is probably the oldest genre of videogames around I cannot explain dodgy collision detection, near invisible projectiles, lacking distinction between foreground and background objects, weird and non-sensical patterns and at times unfair bosses topped by a bombardment of cutscenes that serve no purpose and get old VERY quickly.\n\nThere are some beautiful designs happening and the overall presentation is top notch and worth spending a few bucks as this might be enough to keep you motivated for a while - but ultimately the frustration from (unecessary) flaws in the core-mechanics and gamedesign turned me off.

The weapon upgrades are sufficiently meaty, there's a good variety of secondary weapons useful in their own specific contexts, and the controls are responsive and accurate. Where I feel it shines is in the boss battles; each world boss is very unique and many are grand in scale. All of them are really fun to play.\nIronically, for me the strongest part of this game has been the narrative. While I'm 99% sure the language is a fictional one, it seems to be inspired by eastern European/Slavic languages. The voice acting and story are surprisingly good considering this genre typically just focuses on mechanics, but for those not willing to invest the time, following the plot and reading the huge walls of text will be just another thing to mash the "skip" button through.\nOn the technical side, there seems to be some goofy issues with controller support. Half the time I try to play my 360 pad works beautifully, the other 50% of the time it refuses to recognize it at all. This would be more of an issue if the controller never worked because the game is unplayable with the keyboard in my opinion, but as it stands it's more of an annoyance/inconvenience.\n\nOverall, a great "shmup" title :)","October 30, 2014","true","10.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Huh.\n\nTime travel is one of the biggest cliches in science fiction and is often a highly convenient plot mechanism to force both any deus ex machina the author wants while simultaneously causing enough paradoxical crap going down so that people will have to choice but to make the story a subject of discussion and debate. It's cheap writing and easy to drag to a solipsist extreme.\nThankfully, Sina Mora doesn't fall into that trap. Though you mostly play as the race of time-traveling Enkies fighting against the Empire that enslaved them in order to harness their powers, the time travel aspect of the game is tastefully and responsibly handled.\n\nThe models, backgrounds, and visuals are absolutely stunning and run extremely well on even a poor rig; it's a wonder this game's budget somehow wasn't three times bigger in order to achieve this level of eye-candy. Sound effects and voice-acting are high-quality too, although a choice to have voicing done entirely in the Hungarian language might befuddle those who aren't in on this apparent trend of considering it to be a scifi-friendly language (what).\n\nThe story is mostly told through white-on-black text at the beginnings and endings of each level, with differences in the higher difficulty, and through the encyclopedia unlocked after beating the game once. Actual in-level story exposition is somewhat limited and may confuse people expecting a clear story they won't have to think through much. You'll have to play through the game more than once to get the full picture on things, especially since details on the internet are sparse due to the small audience, and even then, the story is a rather depressing one that is more about the last-stand of a dead nation and a corrupt ex-soldier out to avenge his son, rather than the admirable and effective heroics of bizzarely competent freedom fighters who unquestionably hold the higher ground.\n\nAnd that's where Sine Mora wins me over: they don't pull the time-travel ♥♥♥♥ when someone you like dies. They don't give a name and face to the Empire you're fighting against; they don't caricaturize the horror you're up against. You are told from the start that you are fighting in a doomed war against a massive and anonymous machine that has already wiped out your people past any hope of a meaningful resurgence, and are left with nothing but a gruesome description of what has become of those people.\n\nDespite time travel being the easiest out in any fictional work, this game's story instills you with a crushed hopelessness. Under no delusions of grandeur or heroism, you charge out onto your Endless War. The Enky calendar is one that counts down, and you personify it in your repeated terrorizing throughout the various years you skip to, becoming a demon to those who now live in comfort due to the unwilling sacrifices forced upon your ancestors and descendants.\n","August 21, 2014","true","17.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

It keeps gameplay in traditional side scrolling but rendered in full 3D, all in glorious and gorgeous presentation. This is the new benchmark of what shmup can achieve in the graphic department.\n\nYour main objective is clearing a scene within a particular time. If you get hit you will lose time and if you destroy an enemy you will get an additional time. All of these mechanisms suddenly make sense if you refer to the title of this game which means "without delay" in Latin; You have an ability to slow down time and roll back, even from the dead. The game is all about time.\n\nSine Mora isn't bullet hell, it's more like casual shmup, especially if you start in normal. If you're an expert in this genre and feel mocked by a generous tool of dodging bullet with time manipulation and sub-weapon ability, try arcade/score attack mode in higher difficulty and use only your primary weapon to crank score as high as possible (score multiplier get reduced significantly if you use time ability/sub-weapon or get hit) and be the best in the leaderboard.\n\nThe characters, although pictured as a cartoon figure, they're all really ♥♥♥♥ed up inside. It's one of hell tragic journey and bitter character development I've ever saw in modern gaming, really deep and well developed even mainly done in monologue. The story itself revolves around a band of time-traveler (see?) rebellion group and an empire pilot's father who seek revenge by all means. The plot can get really confusing, as these people jump into the future and past without many explanations, but if you cleared the game in story mode you'll be able to start new alternative narration which will answer many of your questions.\n\nControl is pretty basic, as you only need three buttons beside movement stick in the controller. The only thing missing for keyboard player is a key-binding feature.\n\nOverall Sine Mora is a very refreshing shmup which gives both new and old player in this genre a welcoming challenge of shooter game with an innovative aspect in theme and mechanism, and excelled not only in graphic but storyline as well.

Period. I've read reviews about controller sensitivity and blah blah, but I honestly didn't notice anything like that. I'm using an old XBox controller and it's suiting me fine.

Losing your primary weapon upgrade when you get hit, but having the chance to grab it back immediately afterwards made for some ridiculously fun aerial acrobatics during intense bullet-hell sections. The bosses look great and move beautifully. It's just fun.\n\nThe story is disjointed, but I enjoy that. I like piecing things together a bit more a la Dark Souls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/207040/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","This turned out to be a really visually interesting arcadey shmup, and I had a blast just looking at and discovering things for the first time. It's incredibly well designed and tight with a great depth of options for replay value, it's just such a damn shame that it's so short on levels and content.\n\nHighlights\nThe focus and budget on Sine Mora clearly went into the set designs, which are a really compelling mix of 3D environments played from a 2D point of view. The world is varied and interesting, and the art style is sharp but still arcadey enough to be mostly upbeat and fun. The enemies are all different and while they mostly play the same (take out section X -> move forward or flip angles and take on section Y -> survive through bullet-hell section Z to defeat the enemy) there are a few unique sections where the screen will rotate and it's about accomplishing various objectives, or you'll be dodging more than shooting, or vice versa. These all help to mix the gameplay up and make the enemies interesting.\n\nThe other thing that makes this title shine is the story elements and good writing everywhere. Every character has a well introduced backstory, and not just to give them depth, it also fits them into the story. There's a fantastic encyclopaedia available in the menu screens that helps you understand each aspect of the world and history of the characters more, and the introduction to enemies is very interesting in game. It feels more mature than you'd expect from a typical shmup, especially one with an arcade style gameplay like this.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nBy far the biggest problem with Sine Mora is the lack of content. Clearly it was never intended to be longer than a few hours, and the focus went into the beauty and design of those levels, which shows. But despite the replay value offered by multiple characters, aircraft, unlockables and different gaming modes like score attack and arcade, it's just boring and repetitive after more than a few hours. If you're not a completionist, a die-hard shmup fan, or both then you're unlikely to have reason to play the story more than once or twice.\n\nThe other failure or complaint is that shmup fans typically want to strive for high scores and competitive speedruns, etc. They're the type of gamers who expect more than just a score attack, and get annoyed at things like random score multipliers, random powerups and things that take away from the real competitive aspect of the game. Sine Mora seems to have tried to appease new players and die-hard shmup fans and has failed on the latter as a result.\n\nRecommendations\nAvailable for £7.99/9.99€/$9.99 on Steam and while it's pretty short, it's still fair value when compared to competitors like Jamestown and Raiden III Digital Edition at the same price. When it's on sale, in my opinion it's probably the best option on Steam for a modern entry level shmup for someone like me who isn't heavily into the genre but wants to give something more casual like this a try.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/207040/\n\n* There's a PS Vita exlusive imperial character called Wilhelmine Muller for Sine Mora which was accidentally included with the Steam version but obscured from selection who can be selected for various chronomes.\n\nUnedited review notes 29/10/2015 for Sine Mora:\n\n+Gorgeous use of 3D and 2.5D environments\n+Really really well done design and refinement so that options/add-ons etc work just as well. Game is tight as hell\n+Fantastic boss enemy intros\n+Quite dark/interesting story elements and characters despite cartoony graphics\n+Great sound\n-Too little content or too short, despite huge amount of options/adjustments it's just not enough content\n-Fantastic for bullet hell fans, way too short for everyone else","October 30, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/recommended/207040/","AgreedSA","AgreedSA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/","694 products in account","The gameplay is nice: a combination of R-Type and friends' "they are actually shooting at you, dodge them" enemies interwoven with bullet-heck mechanics. Speaking of mechanics, the game mechanics are a lot of fun - and speaking of R-Type, the game gives you a nice variety of ships to play around with. Several game modes, from story mode to arcade to boss battles; it definitely strives to keep you entertained, and it even provides a low difficulty mode for people who might approach this sort of shooter more casually (and it is quite a lot easier than the less forgiving modes, while still being fun; not such an easy accomplishment, frankly!).\n\nI also really like the controls' responsiveness. If you've played a lot of shmups then you know the difference between a failure of skill and a failure of game design when it comes to whether or not you had that death coming - well, in this game, in my experience, it's pretty much always a failure of skill. You won't go banging into enemies, or walls, or bullets because the controls are tight. Once you spend some time learning how the various special abilities are used (including one predominant one, the ability to slow time temporarily) I think you'll agree that the control scheme is intuitive and straightforward enough, given the level of complexity in varying the ships' capabilities.\n\nThis is one of my favorite shooters right now. Though it shows I've only played it for a bit, that's really because I'm now back fully internet enabled and rediscovered it amongst my stupidly large collection of games. I actually played quite a lot while I was having to play offline for nearly a year due to circumstances and stuck on a tethered data package with only the phone to authenticate every so often, haha.\n\nFinal words... If you're iffy about shooters, might not be for you, but if you're a fan of the genre and you don't give this one a chance you're definitely missing out. It's got most of the things that we shmup fans look for. Thumbs up for sure.","April 2, 2014","true","0.4"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

The game offers full controller support along with full leaderboard integration - something that many shmups forego that is of the utmost importance. What's more fun than competing directly with the entire steam community (including your friends) to see who can get the high score? Like most good shmups it follows the design philosophy of "easy to pick up, hard to master" and in following this motif there are also boss training options along with other game modes to play through. The environments are also quite varied, so whether you're in the heart of a jungle or deep under the ocean, Sine More always has something new to throw at you. The game's unique gameplay mechanic that differentiates it from other shmups is a sort of time slowing device, allowing you to navigate through the bullet hell that becomes your daily existence while playing this awesome sidescolling shooter.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent Graphics\nFull Controller Support\nFull Leaderboard Support\nVariable Weapons/Ships\nGreat Boss Design\n\nCons:\n\nNo English VOs/Subs only (not usually a con, but if you're reading text at the bottom of the screen you're not looking at bullets coming at you - deadly in a shooter like this)\n\nOne of the best shmups on Steam.

The environments and the enemies are 3D, utilizing all the dimensions not just 2D. You fly in and out of view behind obstacles and large bosses making this a more immersive experience.

There's a letter-grade ranking system at the end of each stage, as well as stage select later on so replayability to achieve better scores is there. You also unlock new "characters" which are just different planes each with it's own special weapon and design that you can use across the various modes.\nThe main focus of this game though is the fact that you can slow down time periodically to dodge some of the bullets and live to see the next area!

It proves that Shoot 'Em Ups don't need to be against a flat-panning or blank backgrounds, but can instead tell a story within lush landscapes. The game is an excellent toe in the water for people interested in Bullet Hell, as it has the elements of one at a slower pace. I personally really enjoyed the weight of the plane, rather than feeling like it was a cursor. This game gets a lot of flack for being difficult, as well as many other negative comments I downright balk at-- I simply don't see where they're coming from.\n\nCONS: I've dealt with some compatibility issues running in the past. If you're a seasoned veteran of shmups, you're going to find the slow pace maddening. A fair amount of the story is only available in the encyclopedia and the second playthrough, making is a little confusing upon initial approach. The big problem: Broken achievements. To earn some, you must use a character unavailable in this version. Real heart-breaker.\n\nOVERALL:  I don't know about you, but Sine Mora is nirvana for me. It's not high-strung or jaw-dropping. It's a scenic, entertaining experience that I've enjoyed playing and replaying. I'd love to give a 10/10 if the achievements are ever fixed!\n\nSCORE: 9/10\nEdit: I have made it recently a personal policy to not recommend games with broken achievements.

The voice overs are Japanese (I'm sure they can be switched to English, but I like to play games in the way they're intended) and the text is English so you have to pay attention to the subtitles in order to understand at least something of the story. But even then, it's extremely confusing, with all the different characters and the constant switching between them. It seems rather deep for a shoot 'em up, and who knows... it might actually be true.\n\nSine Mora is a shoot 'em up, llke many other games out there. But it uses a time aspect, meaning you get extra time for killing enemies. Get hit and you'll lose time. It's a solid idea that works very well. You can also slow time down to guide your aircraft between tens of bullets safely. So, as you can see, it mixes things up a little.\n\nEnemies will drop points, subweapons and weapon upgrades as well.\n\nThe environments are beautiful with some nice little touches and the game offers plenty of boss battles. It also runs at a solid 60FPS which helps add to the immersion of it all.\n\nBut it's short. I finished it in 2,5 hours. After that you can try and go for the achievements. The achievement system is actually something I'd like to see more often in games. Here, you have to complete several objectives before getting awarded an achievement. So there's a high replay value if you're into that sort of stuff.\n\nIf you like shoot 'em ups you should get this no matter what.\nBut if you enjoy them from time to time I suggest waiting for a price drop. The price is a bit steep and it's still on the short side.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","November 12, 2012","true","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Given the choice, I would remove this game from my collection and write off the money as an experience worth paying for.

I do not recommend buying this game without downloading the demo to test for bugs.

It's isn't a fancy island, or very big, but it's undeveloped and there's plenty of beachfront property.  There is internet access, but they charge by the gigabyte.  You are slightly tanned and a little thirsty.  You are carrying two suitcases and your nipples are starting to itch.  But you don't want to put down your luggage to scratch them and give in to human weakness.  Instead you decide to walk around the island to find a good spot to put down your pup tent, so you can start fresh in the morning to plot out where you want to build your dream home.  However, distracted by the constant sharp itch pangs coming from your nipples, you lose both track of time and track of how many times you've circled around the same plot of land.  Soon thirst begins to overtake you, and in between attempting to fight it and getting again distracted by your own nipple distresses, you start fall under a heat stroke.  Collapsing to the ground, you fall chest first, with your suitcases pinning you under them.  No longer able to manipulate your arms in such a way to scratch yourself or even lift yourself up, you desperately attempt to worm your body around in such a way as to scratch your nipples across the sandy surface below you.

Saying that I represent the target audience would be optimistic at best, and I appreciate that some of the features in Sine Mora that annoy me are probably what the target audience likes. I only bought the game because it was on heavy discount and I figured I might be in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nLet's start with the biggest plus: Sine Mora looks great, with cartoonish 3D graphics and wonderful backgrounds and awesome boss enemies. The world is vibrant with all manners of details, which makes it nice to look at, but unfortunately I often encountered severe problems with perceiving depth: it was difficult to tell when an enemy was within line of fire or just off to the side depth-wise, a situation made more confusing by some enemies you can engage even though they are far in the background. The edges of certain levels are ridiculously difficult to identify because of their depth curvature, which is exacerbated by the fact that colliding with a wall kills you. What is this, Silver Surfer on the NES? Avoiding walls and projectiles is particularly difficult on the awfully twitchy keyboard controls, so much so that I would never have beaten the game without a controller. Other than these issues, the game is fairly challenging but far from impossible on normal difficulty, although it thinks nothing of throwing a couple of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths your way whenever it thinks it can get away with it.\n\nApart from the wonky perspectives and useless keyboard controls, which are frustrating enough for me not to recommend the game, I suppose Sine Mora is solid enough. There is no health bar; instead you have a set time in which to reach the next checkpoint, and getting hit reduces that time whilst dispatching enemies increases it, which I thought was actually quite a fine and innovative mechanism. I only wish it had been stuck to a better game.\n\nThe story is a bit difficult to keep track of, and it seems to me that it sets off to tell too much in too complex a manner in too little time, but this is the kind of game that people are probably going to play and replay in hopes of high scores, so they should be able to soak up the plot well enough, I suppose.","November 27, 2013","false","4.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/207040/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","I started Sine Mora as a casual game to play between “long games” since according to online sources you can get through it in about 2 hours. I don’t think so. I’ve played the game about 2 and a half hours and there is no way I’m ever going to finish it. Not because the game is bad, but because it’s too hard. The “easy” mode still fills the screen with enemy fire and I don’t see how a casual player can get through it without retrying a million times. I thought maybe I could get a few achievements out of the game at least, but I only got 2 out of the 12 possible and don’t think I’ll be able to advance further.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice on starting the game is that it’s in a different language, with subtitles. I’m not sure what language it is but it sounds Eastern European. The story is difficult to understand since it deals with time travel, revenge, and some sort of interplanetary rebellion. The narration that starts each mission is mostly philosophical and adds very little to the story, just the speaker’s “motivation.” You also constantly switch characters as you play and they all have different backstories. Some of the people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s too, so I wouldn’t call them the “good guys” either. From what I understood, you're playing the members of a rebel team trying to cause damage to the Empire in 2 different time lines (constantly switching between past and present).\n\nSine Mora is a side scrolling “bullet hell” game where you control a small aircraft usually traveling from left to right across the screen with lots of little ships flying past and shooting at you. There is a lot of variety in the game, planes, helicopters, boats, and even a lot of underwater combat. Every level seems to have multiple large boss enemies with various weak points that need to be blasted off. Similar to the old Raiden games (Super Nintendo) you collect weapon power-ups and screen clearing “bombs” (every character has a different secondary weapon, not always bombs). You do not have “lives” or a health bar, but instead you have a timer counting down to zero. When you kill an enemy you get a few seconds added to the clock, and if you take damage you lose some time. Of course when you reach zero you die. One annoying thing is that your weapon power-ups can be lost (they fly off when you take damage) and you have to chase after them before they leave the screen. You do have one big advantage though; all of your characters can slow down time (limited use) and use this to dodge the lasers and missiles flying at you.\n\nPros:\n-Sine Mora is actually pretty fun in the beginning (before it gets insanely hard).\n-Surprisingly good graphics for a game that’s only 300 megabytes. The visuals / bosses seriously look amazing.\n-Many boss battles, which are great in shoot-em up games.\n\nCons:\n-Totally unfairly unbeatably hard by the end. And I was playing “amateur” mode. I’m sure some people can do it, but they’re probably the guys doing 100 hit combos in Marvel vs Capcom. I lost a lot of weapon power-ups to enemy fire and then lost even more when I chased after them trying to collect what I lost. There are also a bunch of instant kill shots that you don’t get warned about.\n-The steam achievements are “chained.” You can’t get the later ones without getting the early ones. For example, Airman, Sargent, Lieutenant, Major, etc. You can’t get Major without getting Lieutenant and I couldn’t even unlock Sargent! Each achievement has a SET of requirements to unlock. So it’s not like “Kill this boss.” To unlock 1 achievement might require: 1) Crash 15 times 2) Get 100% accuracy on any level 3) kill 100 ships, etc. I was stuck on a requirement to finish any level with A rank. Best I could get was a D rank…\n-The story is practically incomprehensible at times. This might be because it’s in another language and is “narrated” to you with heavy character bias.\n-Some of the later bosses will make you tear your hair out. They fill the screen with 100000000 fast moving bullets and half of them are homing. One of them knocked me out in about 20 seconds every time and it wasn’t until my 10th try that I realized he was actually reflecting my bullets back at me (so fast they’re almost invisible). The time slowing power might be enough to get through a boss fight, but each level seems to have at least 2 bosses.\n\nOverall I do not recommend the game to casual players and only to people who have awesome hand eye coordination. It’s a shame too because I really liked the graphics and shoot-em up in the beginning of the game. The difficulty killed it for me though. I can’t say I enjoyed the experience overall.","August 29, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Firsty, i believe it wise to praise the Devs for bringing back a  genre that seems to be slowly fading out of the gaming world, while we all must remember that side scrolling shooters are what filled the arcades back in the day and i think what brings back a lot of memories for people such as my self.\n\nOk so hands down this game, graphically is mind blowing! gameplay is superb while maintaining the arcade feel of a shoot em up. Big end bosses with their own hit targets and enemies have their own life bars, so no longer is it one shot kills which makes the game more challenging if you are to get 100% kill rate in a level.\n\nThe game has 4 main modes;\n\nStory Mode\nArcade Mode\nScore Attack\nBoss Attack.\n\nOne thing i will say is that the story mode, for me personally made no sense what so ever...a very difficult story to follow, coupled with annoying cut screens every few mintues made it a less enjoyable experience. No flow to it, it seemed you shot a few enemies then a cut screen, shot a few more etc.....\n\nThe strength lies in the other modes.....where you can play it how shooters were meant to be played...uninterrupted.....for this alone i recommend picking this game up if you were a fan of games like Blaze on, R Type, GunBird...all those old school shooters.....mix that with modern graphics and engine....and you have a fun, challenging, albeit short shooter....but for the price i would def reccommend getting it.","February 9, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gameplay is average, basically 3 attacks, your standard unlimted machine gun, slow time and strong unique weapon attack, unfortunatly the enemies are a little more eratic bascially they shoot patterns of bullets and you dodge them but not really, you can touch a bullet with rim of your ship and not lose time but direct hit you lost 5 seconds, there are a few puzzles in the game which are lame basically it is just manuvering your ship in a tight space and if you get hit you instantly die. Boss fights are stupid they shoot large amounts of eratic bullets that can rarely be dodged but in turn are super weak and easily destroyed. Weak story line, it seemed quite good first 3 stages and then it just introduced to many characters and i couldnt be bothered following it anymore. Not a bad side scroller plane shooter but didnt offer enough uniqueness to really qualify it for a recommendaton from me, also what is up with the random scoring in the game? Basically units randomly drop coins to give you bonus points or you get combo bonus for how quickly you kill enemies after they appear the whole thing seemed unbalanced and quite a pointless addition unless you want steam achievements in which case you better get an amazing score so you can get a nice little pointless promotion that does nothing to aid you in the game.","April 1","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I see all of these reviews talking about how challenging Sine Mora was... and all I can think is, "Maybe I didnt play long enough to see the later levels?" I got about four and a half levels in, before I got bored, and I never died during that time. The problem with the games difficulty is that, compared to older bullet hells  which typically only allowed you to get struck once or a very few times before dying, Sine Mora allows you to get hit as often as you like, replacing the classic "lives" system with a timer that gets decreased every time you are struck, and which can be replenished by killing enemies. Doing poorly really only lowers your score, because you can survive many strikes as long as you always kill all of the enemies on the screen in the process. Couple this with a bullet-time esque super power and the game seems devoid of tense situations, despite the abundance of enemies and bullets on the screen at any given time.\n\nThis is a very strange departure from the classic formula, and one which I think was as much for the worse, as it was unnecessary. And, meanwhile, the game fails to address the most important mechanic of bullet hell games: the weapon upgrade system. Or, more specifically, how you balance weapon loss with weapon advancement, so that the player neither has too strong, nor too weak, of a primary weapon.\n\nClassic bullet hells simply emptied your guns when you died, and forced you to start from scratch when you respawned. This meant you were quite likely to get little farther than however far you made it on your first life, because you needed maxed out guns to handle leter stage enemy waves. It's a great tactic for soaking up quarters in the arcade, but it was largely abandoned when the genre came home to private consoles. Super Nintendo and Genesis bullet hells typically employed some kind of self-balancing mechanic which would give you weapon upgrades more frequently after respawning, and slower once your weapons were more advanced, so that you always had firepower appropriate to the stage of the game you were at.\n\nSine Mora however, doubles down on irritation of the former, poorer, mechanic by using a system that ostensibly allows you to recover lost weapons immediately, but actually serves to be even more frustrating. When you are struck, one or more of your weapon upgrades will fall off of your ship and you have to race forward, often into harms way, to catch them. You will very likely be struck again trying, and thus loose more upgrades. The more advanced your weapons are, the more parts you will lose with each hit. While playing, I found that because the game created no real fear of failure for me, the only reason I was worried about being hit, was because I got incredibly frustrated chasing down my upgrades... even though I really didnt need them, because the game gave me enough bumbs/special attacks to eliminate most boses without a problem.\n\nOn top of the general gameplay problems, I found the constant cinimatic interuptions to be EXTREMELY irritating. They seemed to occur every fifteen seconds or so, with no purpose other than to show off the games pretty scenery. The enemies often enter the plane of action from behind it, and I frequently found myself firing at enemies I wouldnt be able to hit for another few seconds, while I waited for them to "enter" my field of fire. The story is delivered in pages of text two or three times each level, the characters are all bland and unlikeable, and the story is so dark next to the bright, colorful levels, that it was almost mood killing.\n\nThis game was just... not fun. It got my interest the second I saw it in the store, and it lost my interest in just under an hour. The game mechanics are bad, the controls are equally as bad on mouse, keyboard, and gamepad, and I could not wrap my head around the design decisions these developers made. Many of the levels take place UNDER WATER, even though you are very clearly flying a WW2-era inspired fighter plane.\n\nI didnt enjoy this at all, and I dont recommend it, especially not to fans of bullet hell games.","August 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a sidescroller (very similar to the arcade classics Raiden, Gradius, Life Force, etc) so I wanted to try it out. Sine Mora is essentially the same game so I don't want to go into too much detail about how to play it. Though this game has one of the best dynamic backgrounds/foregrounds I have ever seen a game, it is that very feature that also leads to its downfall. Things will frequently fly in and out of "the middle area" where you play in and it's very hard to tell whether or not you can actually shoot it, or go through them. It's not always a problem on its own but when combined with others, it's hard to deal with.\n\nAnother problem is just its difficulty. The game allows you to use a slo-mo effect to dodge many attacks but its very limited. Very limited being a couple of seconds during a long assault. It doesn't recharge until you reach certain powerups as far as I can tell so once you use it all, you're going to be dying a lot. That leads to points being lost and many penalties in your overall grade. Not to mention the enemies that come from behind you; these enemies cannot be hit since your ship doesn't have a backwards attack.\n\nHow did they not notice these problems in the final product? Sine Mora runs great and plays fine but the gameplay is a major set-back.\n\nController highly recommended for this. Game is not in English, but has subtitles.\n\nObligatory score: 6/10","June 29, 2014","false","1.4"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

Just a lot of fictional facts and talk about revenge, no context and no character background was given. Which would be ok... If it weren't for the fact that all the cutscenes, dialogues, infodumps and such kill an already slow pacing. In an arcade shmup? That's unacceptable. This isn't Metal Gear Solid. There's even moments where the dialogue in-game literally obscures a good part of the screen while enemies are still coming at you.\nIn arcade mode, you only get play on hard or insane difficulties. If you want to focus on getting to know the mechanics well before going into hard mode (which is imperative when you don't have lives but time), you have to hear that damn story.\n\nThe gameplay has its pros and cons.\nSome boss attack patterns and stage moments were pretty nice. But you often find yourself against walls of bullets without the possibility to slow the ship (or "focus") because this doesn't exist in Sine Mora. There's somethink like it, called time capsule, which slows time (but not your ship), and it's finite. Once you've run out of it, the only way to replenish is through randomized drops from enemies.\nSome attacks, specially during boss fights, are clearly unavoidable without fast reflexes and time capsule, and that would be actually cool if it was possible to refill it systematically, but you can't so you are screwed if you have finished it.\nYou sometimes find yourself (specially in caves) wondering where you can move because you'll sometimes run against rocks or stuff that you thought was just in the background.\nOnce you take a hit, you lose some shot power upgrades that go flying around and that you won't be usually able to recover unless you want to risk jumping in the middle of a group of enemies, which might mean losing even more shot power.\nGraphics and artstyle are very nice, but music? It was so forgettable that I don't even remember if there was some background music to begin with, and I'm not even joking. Bossfights are also nothing special to be honest, and they are much more nice to look for their design that fun to beat for the challenge they pose.\nOh, and you don't get to choose your ship. The game does it for you in story mode. Level after level I found myself with different ships that had different sub-weapons every time.\n\nI gave up after using all my continues in a part where you had to do something otherwise everything around you would just explode. It was most definitely explained in one of the dialogues before, which I clearly fast-forwared because of how annoying they were, and guess what? The dialogue didn't come back up after you died. I was just repeating the same part and exploding again trying to figure out in the few seconds you had what you were supposed to do. Nice.\n\nOverall, this game not only lacks impact, but it's a big mess and fails at being both arcade and story-driven. What's nice in Sine Mora is the bling, the graphics, the designs and all these things.... Stuff which I don't really care about in a shmup when it doesn't even have it's basics covered.\nThe game can get very cheap during big discounts so if you don't trust me you can give it a shot. It's more bad than good but not so bad that you would regret spending a dollar or two to see how it really is with your own eyes.","May 29, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/207040/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","In every facet of its design Sine Mora exudes excellence. Considerably well polished from presentation to gameplay, it tells a surprisingly engaging tale of a father's unremitting resolve to take revenge for the death of his son, and takes itself very seriously with mass genocide, physical abuse, and suicide all sharing a place in the unflinching narrative. Even if the plot occasionally becomes convoluted, there is so much conviction in every line of script that it almost didn't matter what was being said. I found it fascinating, and though it is entirely possible to skip straight to the action, those wanting for something more substantial should find plenty to keep them occupied.\n\nA side-scrolling shooter is only as good as its gameplay though, and once again Grasshopper Manufacture outdoes itself. Contrary to my expectations of Ikaruga like color swapping, Sine Mora is an entirely new breed of bullet-hell centered around time. Your life is literally dictated as seconds on the clock, and with each enemy you kill that time is extended. Inversely getting hit reduces it, and thus the frenzied back and forth between racing through levels and sending as many enemies to their grave as possible is born.\n\nI've never pretended to be good at this style of game, but Sine Mora strikes a perfect balance between the constant insanity of bullets and giving you the control needed to survive them. In contrast to just about everything similar I have played, there was never a point that I felt overwhelmed or unable to continue, and it is for that very reason that I would whole wholeheartedly recommend those interested in bullet-hell games start here. It isn't an easy game by any stretch, but completing it is certainly achievable for both veterans and novices alike (the former will find plenty of challenge in the higher difficulty level, score challenges, and multiple ranks to shoot for).\n\nIt only takes one look at Sine Mora in motion to see it is a downright gorgeous game, but more impressive than even the great texture, lighting and particle effects is the fantastically creative steampunk art direction. Each level is taken up in large part by incredible boss battles the design of which only become more involved and more impressive in scale as they go on, reminding me of everything from The Matrix to Porco Rosso. I rarely bother with concept or unlockable artwork, but I was actually disappointed there was none to be found here. I do wish they had done away with the letterbox framing, but otherwise I was simply awestruck at the visuals and have no doubt that other games will be compared to them for a long time to come.\n\nGrasshopper Games diverse and bizarre catalog is more often than not know for offering quirky yet ultimately shallow experiences, but Sine Mora isn't one of them.  This is a full package of outstanding quality, hands down one of the best side-scrolling shooters I have played in years, and one that can be enjoyed regardless of skill level. If you're a fan of bullet-hell shooters or ever wanted to be, then this is something you should definitely be checking out!","October 27, 2013","true","2.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Would happily Start up and play again over and over, which is more than can be said for half the games on my steam library.\n\nTL:DR 5-Star, Worth it, Generously Fun, Challenging but fair.\n","February 22, 2014","true","5.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game has instant kills that will COMPLETELY RESET your story progress lol. I got to the part where you blow open a trash chute and fans are blowing garbage around 1-hit death lasers, and I died and used all 8 continues in under a minute tops, despite not dying once until that point for about 45 minutes of play. The problem is I think some lasers were killing me but I had no idea how to dodge them and just kept dying. Even slow motion wasn't helping. Was cool until one spot instantly ruined my fun. Not by any means a classic shooter. It is hard for the wrong reasons while old school tough shooters are hard for the right reasons. Just a warning to potential sale buyers that the game is awesome for about 45 minutes and that is it. This nonsense would not have ever flown in the arcades and that is where some of the all-time hardest shmups were. Oh and arcade mode when you select it, the only difficulties for it are "hard" or "insane". I tried arcade hard mode and it is just one hit deaths aplenty.

A bullet hell arcade shooter opens with a cutscene?! Well, that's alright, the prompt says I can hold LB to fast forward, that means I can skip right past this... OH MY GOD! It literally means fast forward! I can't skip the cutscene. I either have to wade through this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ derivative storyline, or fast-forward through it, in which case I still have to read the text, and the I have no sound.\n\n♥♥♥♥, OK. I'll just fast forward through it.\n\n2) The shooting. Awww yeah... Time for some amazing side-scrolling R-Type combat. Man! This game looks amazing. It's kind of easy, but meh, whatever. I'm really starting to enjoy this and - OH MY GOD! Another cutscene! I've been shooting for about 30 seconds. Alright, well, I'll FF this one too. Takes about 45 secs. to FF the cutscene.\n\nBasically, I played the entire first level. First level = approx. 1:30 of shooting, and about 2:00 of fast-forwarding through ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscenes that don't even belong in the game.\n\nYou want a good bullet hell shooter? Get Jamestown. Or Satazius or R-Type. This game is a navel-gazing wankfest that embodies almost everything that's wrong with modern day games. And after reading some reviews, I'm sure the cutscenes are mandatory because if they were removed, the game would last about an hour.\n\nSave your money.","January 23, 2014","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I beat the story mode in a bit less than an hour without much reason to go back besides getting a higher score. Which isn't fun when the missions the same everytime to me and is excacerbated by small number of missions. And small variaty in enemies and bosses.\n-Handles continues and deaths in a weird way. HP is accustomed to a timer. Killing things gets you a few seconds on your timer while getting it takes time. The timer is also always counting down and in the case it hits zero you die. You can use a continue to restart. Its just a weird system\n-In tunnel areas its extremely easy to hit a wall and possibly insta die because the hitbox of the wall and the graphic are not always in the same place as to allow you to know where you will take damage and not.\n-Hamfisted story thats hard to care about and gets more in the way than anything.\n-Narration in some made up gibberish language instead of english. At that point, why even narrate?\n-Everyone is an ugly furry, no sexy husky men or anthromorphic dragons or horses to be found.\n-Repatitive gameplay thanks to lack of content.\n\nPros\n+Really good looking Shoot-Em Up. Both techincally and in graphical design and artistry put into characters, the world, and even the UI/menus.\n+Is still a fun game if you can look past the frustration from cheap deaths but probably still fun due to the basic Shoot-Em Up design behind it all\n\n\nSummary\nIts an okay game. Don't be expecing a instant classic but its a game thats worth a dollar or two if you are interested in it. The current $10 retail is just to much with all I have seen in this game (which isn't a whole lot).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fogcast/recommended/207040/","fogcast","FoG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fogcast/","870 products in account","Game #7 - Sine Mora (PC)\n\nNovember 8, 2014\nMy love for Side-Scrolling Shooters dates back to my earliest gaming years. I think I was about 6 when I played Defender on my 2600 and even though it was a mess of huge pixels on a Black and White 11" Tube TV, it was the challenge that I truly enjoyed. Since then, I have played almost every shooter that I could play. Some have been outstanding and others have been downright horrible. Sine Mora is more of the former than the latter.\n\nThe striking thing about this game is the story. It's almost so heavily weighted on dialog that it's 50% of the entire game, which in story mode is only about 3 hours on the normal difficulty setting. It was pointed out on my Cast that the game seems to be similar to Star Fox in many ways, almost an 2D homage to the series. I'd like to think that the developers brought that into the game as a tribute, but regardless the story and characters are solid. Additionally, the graphics of Sine Mora are great, hands down they are gorgeous. The enemy types are in abundance and the Boss Battles are challenging without being insurmountable. Overall, the game is as solid in the Shooter category as any contender out there.\n\nAlthough the game Story Mode is shorter, there are multiple game options from Arcade to Challenge Modes. Each of these game types offer multiple difficulty settings to extend the game experience. I would suggest that you could get 10+ hours out of this game if you played each option through to completion. As for the price, Steam sells Sine Mora for $9.99, but I know that different Holiday sales have brought the title down to below $3. I would suggest waiting till one of the sales just to feel better about the e extremely short Story Mode.\n\nThe average Metacritic score is 77 based on review sites across the Internet. I feel that a solid 8 would do this game justice, and especially if you find it for sub $5. Even if you have to pay full price for this title, you should enjoy the overall experience and have a lot of fun on your hands.\n\n\n\nFoG\n\n#HistoryWillBePlayed\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/sine-mora\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/fansofgames/b/586477184","November 8, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is also a limited amount of time you have before dying that gets a few extra seconds every time you kill an enemy and that gets reduced when you are hit, so its also kind of your health.\naside from that you really just shoot the stoff coming at you and dodge what you cant shoot, with different subweapons depeding on the  pilot and you pick up powerups on the way. after death you have a limited amount of continues that let you start again from the last checkpoint (though I often had moments of "WHAT? Way back there was the last checkpoint? god damnit") if you get a total gameover you only have to restart a story chapter not the entire thing.\nThat description doesnt do the game justice though. What amazed me is the variety the game offers.\nYou will never really encounter the same enemy for to long, the areas all feel unique and all of it looks gorgeous. the bossfights are numerous and epic, like seriously you get thrown against one epic machine of doom after another.\nI cant say anything about the difficult difficulties, I do know however, that even the easyest difficulty will sometimes require restarting a chapter because it still is bullethellish after all.\nThe downsides:\nFirst and foremost the length. If you dont play this to get all the achievements, if you dont play this failing every 20 seconds because you chose a difficulty that is way to high for you, then you should, like me, get two hours out of this. those may be the best two hours you have ever had with a shmup but it is still questionable if that is worth 10 euros/dollars/billion simbabwe dollars/whatever. so I would reccomend waiting for a sale.\nbtw I checked on the achievement guide, and if you want to get all of those you can count on 50 hours or more worth of gametime. I think id quickly lose the fun in that though.\nmy second problem is a technical issue that maybe I was just to blind to see the fix for in the option: the mouse\nif I wanted to fly accross the screen my plane was always one sluggish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥forcing me repeteadly flail my mouse across the desk to dodge the bullets fast enough.\nyeah thats it, really cant think of anything negative except for that.\n","March 20, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wonderful graphics, a terrific storyline laden with sorrow and grief (I MEAN it) and a polished, well-made feel to it. As a graphic designer, I can say that the whole game exhales good taste, from the menus and interfaces to the choice of using the voice acting in the original language of the developers (hungarian), which just adds to the whole experience. Expect huge bosses, hundreds of power-ups (but no leveling system) and lots of noise from all the explosions and destruction. Pay close attention to insta-kill gimmicks, for they might catch you offguard.\n\nOnly negative aspect in the game, in my opinion, is the soundtrack. I know the name behind it is a great one (Akira Yamaoka, known for the Silent Hill series), but the songs are not remarkable and don't have much presence in-game. Also, make sure to use a gamepad for maximum enjoyment (though a regular keyboard setup will still do the trick nicely!).\n\nAll in all, if you have at least a little bit of interest in the genre I'd highly recommend giving it a try. As I said, it's a game made with good taste and attention to detail, truly a piece of good craftsmanship if that makes any sense.

I have three major issue with this game and we'll start off with the elephant in the room... this game when you first play it has so many instant death situations that at some point, it started to make me feel that they added them there to make the game feel longer than what it is on the outset like it needed any extending I mean hell... the game is One and a Half Hours long... that's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing long for a SHMUP already. The game has multiple mechanics which includes Time Slowing(and many more outside the story missions), having a timer as your health that replenishes when you kill enemies and degenerates when you get hit and, Multiple Characters and Ship combination for the types of Bombs and Vulcan you'll be using... its quite robust outside of the Story mode... that is if you can chew up how hard it is.\n\nDifficulty: Okay, so let me step back for a second... Sine Mora is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to play but not because of the bullets even though they are bullet hell like, they are still manageable since they are slow although confusing for the most part since there are so many types of them, some are even one hit wonders which adds to the whole bumpy ride at the beginning that I was talking about... Anyways... the game is hard for three reasons... The "Stage Specific Mechanics", The Confusing Hitbox and The Flying Power Ups... Let us start with Stage Specific Mechanics... I'm talking specifically about Stage III really... The Stealth part of that stage plus the wrecking ball made me go down from Challenging to Normal difficulty. Later on, there would be other stage specific mechanics that will one hit you... you'll see. Now the confusing hitbox is quite the thing because it reminds me of ♥♥♥♥ing DonPachi. Apparently, its the Ship's class(where the pilot is) is the hitbox, which is different on each ship... Lastly, it's the Flying Power ups... now this game has four difficulty. Normal and Challenging for Story and, Hard and Insane for Arcade. Normal is easy as hell, Challenging adds more Health to enemies, bullets, health penalties and so much more that is quite a damn gap... and it just gets crazy from there...\n\nThe Power Up Annoyance: So here is how it works... You get hit, you loose time and all of your Power ups fly off at random directions, if you play on a harder difficulty, you have less invulnerability period in between hits and health penalties are bigger. So either risk dying trying to pick them all up again or just use your tiny Vulcan, so that means now you can't deal that much damage and in harder difficulties... enemies have more health... so in summary... Don't... Get... Hit... like ever... it's pretty damn strict.\n\nStory: The Reason why this game is M rated is because of its storyline... It's Grim... grim as all hell. I don't really need since the whole story like is really interesting(although why is it only on Hungarian Language confuses me) to spoil anything but let's just say that Blackmailing a girl that suffered both ♥♥♥♥ and cancer(not to mention the extinction of her race with the survivors being put into forced labor and experimentation) is just not cool bro.\n\nArt: The characters are furries... Did that turn you off? ♥♥♥♥ off then. Either way... it adds to the creative side of the game... It has amazing graphical fidelity and it runs really well... on my Titan anyways... Also... the boss design are really interesting and very imaginative like the rest of the game... Now I'm not a fan of the whole 2.5D perspective even if its an eye candy... I just want to see ♥♥♥♥ clearly like in Akai Katana and Progear Storm... this reminds me of Enhander... a little too much in fact. Now... In my screen... this game actually has some graphical issues however which sadly lets down the experience a little bit...\n\nMusic: The Last problem that I have with this game is the music... it doesn't... fit... it sounds ambient and... strangely cheerful(especially the boss theme), which for a grim storyline and a strange world that is shown to the player... this... is a contrast... I just cant tell if its meant to be though...\n\nVerdict: Its still a thumbs up meanly because of how challenging it is while still being operational(just keep a lot of things in mind that is). The story itself is intriguing enough to keep me playing and the modes that it offers gives it a lot of replay value and top it off with a rich scoring system. Sine Mora is quite a treat for shoot em up fans out there... just... toss most of what you think of other shmups and just keep your mind on this one... before you can disappointed or frustrated by your own standards and by the things you are used to. Am talking to you Touhou and Cave fans. ;)","December 29, 2013","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is good. It's a pretty game. They throw a lot of characters and story at you that don't seem to make any sense and I really just didn't care. I found the characters uncompelling. It doesn't help that the speech it's in Hungarian. So I mostly just ignored their attempts to link a plotline to the shoot-things-until-they-explode-while-avoiding-bullets.\n\nThe difficulty is really random. It's stupid easy until suddenly it's impossible. It could be that I'm just missing special mechanics sometimes, but on some bosses it seems like it really is just impossible to avoid all the bullets. That said, I can at least tell what is and is not a bullet--better than other modern games of this type that I've played. The other thing, which I've had a problem with on a lot of the newer, 3D side-scrollers is that it can be impossible to tell what is collidable until you run ito it.  One level, the ground may not be collidable, but the next one it is. Or the roof may be collidable, or there may be environment that is or isn't. I guess that makes it good for multiple playthroughs to say that you know all the quirks of this level so it makes you feel more accomplished, but I dunno. At least modern games are forgiving enough to let you start off where you left off the last time you played and you don't have to do the whole game in one sitting. If you do accidentally hit quit rather than continue when you die, you'll be at the gimpy firepower level when you restart the stage, so it'll be tough.\n\nI don't think I care for the "time remaining is also your health" mechanic. Who cares if I take a really long time on a boss? The whole time travel thing I didn't bother to follow, either, and I really just don't care.\n\nUsing a controller is perferrable to a keyboard on this game, I think.","March 18, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is streamlined and  functional, owing to a 3-button style (not including directionals) and simple, well-balanced time-slowing mechanic-- for me, easily the best use of 'bullet time' since the phenomenon started.  The world and characters are very well-crafted, although the story was a bit hard to follow- time travel plays a big part, and well... it's time travel.  The game truly shines in its art direction.  The environments, aircraft, and enemies are beautifully designed.  Although I would've expected it to be a problem, enemy bullets are highly visible and only manage to blend into the background a little during the prequel mission, which doesn't really count.  Every stage of the game has its own style and character, and often employs appropriate environmental hazards.  Difficulty is reasonably paced- a modest challenge in story mode ranging to reasonably merciless in arcade mode.  Overall, an extremely fun and aesthetically pleasing game executed with solid consistency.  Most certainly the sort of game that will keep me coming back for more.","February 22, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The kind of game the Japanese would have strived to make if they stayed on the path of fantasy robotics instead of basing every game around annoying school girls. The boss fights are the highlight as they are frequent, have their unique styles, vary in their attack patterns and weapons but the aircrafts, backgrounds and level designs also deserve some praise. Story is short and sweet as it fits in between the levels, spoken by anthropomorphic characters that don't look like they belong on a Saturday morning cartoon and what they have to say really sets the scene. It is short enough to finish in one setting which makes it all the more replayable and although it isn't annoyingly hard to complete it is just as challenging as any other bullet hell if you care about scores.","February 16, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and backgrounds are visually stunning and beautifully rendered, the music is fairly decent, and there is pretty much no learning curve to the basic controls.\nThe story is pretty complex for a shoot em up and I'm still not entirely certain that I have it figured out. Of course it doesn't help that there is no English audio track, the dialog is still in the original Hungarian.\nThe game's difficulty quickly escalates once you make it past Stage III or so, and it is relentless. It is a challenging difficulty that can frustrate players to either give up on the game entirely or try the level again with a vengeance. It really requires players to become familiar with the game's power ups and time manipulation mechanics.

If you can pick it up on sale, or like the demo then go for it, but for $10 it's not at all worth it unless you have a fetish for SHMUPS.\n\nStory is overly fragmented and stupid until you put a lot of time for it to come together but then you don't even care at that point. Music is bland but serviceble.\n\nBackgrounds are overly detailed where projectiles and mobs just blend in and get lost. Lots of levels just have random instant-death areas and there are some obstacle courses that are just boring. Vertical movement is very sluggish. Combat is kind of fun bullet-hell, but the design is bad where you lost both your weapon powerups and time if you touch something and then suddenly you can't kill as fast and will lose 20 seconds later because you've been time penalized too. Go play Ikaruga when it inevitably comes out on Steam, Jamestown, or Ether instead.\n\nTL:DR; a bad SHMUP for people with a hungarian furry-fetish.","December 5, 2012","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No originality there at all unfortunately and it's just disappointing.\nTrain boss, plane boss, building boss, orb boss that bounces around. All the cliches are here.\nSpeaking of bosses, they were *very* samey, shoot here and there, ok it moves a bit, now shoot here and no real clever use of cover, tactics and aerial acrobatics needed.\nThe actual feedback that youve been hit is so small quite often if you have a large time amount left you just sit point blank to whittle down boss weakpoints which makes for a drab affair.\n\nThe big thumbs up is the actual art/graphics and styling, plus the sound is also good and the music fits though pretty much instantly forgettable. You aren't going to be humming this one at the dinner table as it's stuck in your head I'm afraid.\n\nIt's a C+ from me so it's recommended IF and that's a big IF, it's cheap.

I have three major issue with this game and we'll start off with the elephant in the room... this game when you first play it has so many instant death situations that at some point, it started to make me feel that they added them there to make the game feel longer than what it is on the outset like it needed any extending I mean hell... the game is One and a Half Hours long... that's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing long for a SHMUP already. The game has multiple mechanics which includes Time Slowing(and many more outside the story missions), having a timer as your health that replenishes when you kill enemies and degenerates when you get hit and, Multiple Characters and Ship combination for the types of Bombs and Vulcan you'll be using... its quite robust outside of the Story mode... that is if you can chew up how hard it is.\n\nDifficulty: Okay, so let me step back for a second... Sine Mora is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to play but not because of the bullets even though they are bullet hell like, they are still manageable since they are slow although confusing for the most part since there are so many types of them, some are even one hit wonders which adds to the whole bumpy ride at the beginning that I was talking about... Anyways... the game is hard for three reasons... The "Stage Specific Mechanics", The Confusing Hitbox and The Flying Power Ups... Let us start with Stage Specific Mechanics... I'm talking specifically about Stage III really... The Stealth part of that stage plus the wrecking ball made me go down from Challenging to Normal difficulty. Later on, there would be other stage specific mechanics that will one hit you... you'll see. Now the confusing hitbox is quite the thing because it reminds me of ♥♥♥♥ing DonPachi. Apparently, its the Ship's class(where the pilot is) is the hitbox, which is different on each ship... Lastly, it's the Flying Power ups... now this game has four difficulty. Normal and Challenging for Story and, Hard and Insane for Arcade. Normal is easy as hell, Challenging adds more Health to enemies, bullets, health penalties and so much more that is quite a damn gap... and it just gets crazy from there...\n\nThe Power Up Annoyance: So here is how it works... You get hit, you loose time and all of your Power ups fly off at random directions, if you play on a harder difficulty, you have less invulnerability period in between hits and health penalties are bigger. So either risk dying trying to pick them all up again or just use your tiny Vulcan, so that means now you can't deal that much damage and in harder difficulties... enemies have more health... so in summary... Don't... Get... Hit... like ever... it's pretty damn strict.\n\nStory: The Reason why this game is M rated is because of its storyline... It's Grim... grim as all hell. I don't really need since the whole story like is really interesting(although why is it only on Hungarian Language confuses me) to spoil anything but let's just say that Blackmailing a girl that suffered both ♥♥♥♥ and cancer(not to mention the extinction of her race with the survivors being put into forced labor and experimentation) is just not cool bro.\n\nArt: The characters are furries... Did that turn you off? ♥♥♥♥ off then. Either way... it adds to the creative side of the game... It has amazing graphical fidelity and it runs really well... on my Titan anyways... Also... the boss design are really interesting and very imaginative like the rest of the game... Now I'm not a fan of the whole 2.5D perspective even if its an eye candy... I just want to see ♥♥♥♥ clearly like in Akai Katana and Progear Storm... this reminds me of Enhander... a little too much in fact. Now... In my screen... this game actually has some graphical issues however which sadly lets down the experience a little bit...\n\nMusic: The Last problem that I have with this game is the music... it doesn't... fit... it sounds ambient and... strangely cheerful(especially the boss theme), which for a grim storyline and a strange world that is shown to the player... this... is a contrast... I just cant tell if its meant to be though...\n\nVerdict: Its still a thumbs up meanly because of how challenging it is while still being operational(just keep a lot of things in mind that is). The story itself is intriguing enough to keep me playing and the modes that it offers gives it a lot of replay value and top it off with a rich scoring system. Sine Mora is quite a treat for shoot em up fans out there... just... toss most of what you think of other shmups and just keep your mind on this one... before you can disappointed or frustrated by your own standards and by the things you are used to.

The most notable feature is probably that it looks really good, both in art style and technical realization. Story, characters and the world is also better than you would expect for a game in this genre. As for features, there isn't anything that you haven't seen in other games, it's a standard shoot 'em up. Difficulty is well varied - on Normal it should be easy to get through the game, even for people unfamiliar with this genre; Challenging is what it says it is and there are two higher difficulties, that I personally won't be able to do without a lot and a lot of practice. Sine Mora isn't particularly long, but this isn't a game that you play through once and forget. For longevity there are thoughtful achievements, which guide your skill progression.

The storyline is very well written, and captured me right from the beginning scenes. As far as gameplay goes, I'd say they deserve a cookie, a vast array of airships, ground defenses, and submarines make use of the even larger collection of upgradable weaponry.

The boss fights are the highlight as they are frequent, have their unique styles, vary in their attack patterns and weapons but the aircrafts, backgrounds and level designs also deserve some praise. Story is short and sweet as it fits in between the levels, spoken by anthropomorphic characters that don't look like they belong on a Saturday morning cartoon and what they have to say really sets the scene.

Also if you die/continue you start with no upgrades.

Gameplay is streamlined and  functional, owing to a 3-button style (not including directionals) and simple, well-balanced time-slowing mechanic-- for me, easily the best use of 'bullet time' since the phenomenon started.  The world and characters are very well-crafted, although the story was a bit hard to follow- time travel plays a big part, and well... it's time travel.  The game truly shines in its art direction.  The environments, aircraft, and enemies are beautifully designed.  Although I would've expected it to be a problem, enemy bullets are highly visible and only manage to blend into the background a little during the prequel mission, which doesn't really count.  Every stage of the game has its own style and character, and often employs appropriate environmental hazards.  Difficulty is reasonably paced- a modest challenge in story mode ranging to reasonably merciless in arcade mode.  Overall, an extremely fun and aesthetically pleasing game executed with solid consistency.  Most certainly the sort of game that will keep me coming back for more.","February 22, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No originality there at all unfortunately and it's just disappointing.\nTrain boss, plane boss, building boss, orb boss that bounces around. All the cliches are here.\nSpeaking of bosses, they were *very* samey, shoot here and there, ok it moves a bit, now shoot here and no real clever use of cover, tactics and aerial acrobatics needed.\nThe actual feedback that youve been hit is so small quite often if you have a large time amount left you just sit point blank to whittle down boss weakpoints which makes for a drab affair.\n\nThe big thumbs up is the actual art/graphics and styling, plus the sound is also good and the music fits though pretty much instantly forgettable. You aren't going to be humming this one at the dinner table as it's stuck in your head I'm afraid.\n\nIt's a C+ from me so it's recommended IF and that's a big IF, it's cheap.

The art is good. It's a pretty game. They throw a lot of characters and story at you that don't seem to make any sense and I really just didn't care. I found the characters uncompelling. It doesn't help that the speech it's in Hungarian. So I mostly just ignored their attempts to link a plotline to the shoot-things-until-they-explode-while-avoiding-bullets.\n\nThe difficulty is really random. It's stupid easy until suddenly it's impossible. It could be that I'm just missing special mechanics sometimes, but on some bosses it seems like it really is just impossible to avoid all the bullets. That said, I can at least tell what is and is not a bullet--better than other modern games of this type that I've played. The other thing, which I've had a problem with on a lot of the newer, 3D side-scrollers is that it can be impossible to tell what is collidable until you run ito it.  One level, the ground may not be collidable, but the next one it is. Or the roof may be collidable, or there may be environment that is or isn't. I guess that makes it good for multiple playthroughs to say that you know all the quirks of this level so it makes you feel more accomplished, but I dunno. At least modern games are forgiving enough to let you start off where you left off the last time you played and you don't have to do the whole game in one sitting. If you do accidentally hit quit rather than continue when you die, you'll be at the gimpy firepower level when you restart the stage, so it'll be tough.\n\nI don't think I care for the "time remaining is also your health" mechanic. Who cares if I take a really long time on a boss? The whole time travel thing I didn't bother to follow, either, and I really just don't care.\n\nUsing a controller is perferrable to a keyboard on this game, I think.","March 18, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is streamlined and  functional, owing to a 3-button style (not including directionals) and simple, well-balanced time-slowing mechanic-- for me, easily the best use of 'bullet time' since the phenomenon started.  The world and characters are very well-crafted, although the story was a bit hard to follow- time travel plays a big part, and well... it's time travel.  The game truly shines in its art direction.  The environments, aircraft, and enemies are beautifully designed.  Although I would've expected it to be a problem, enemy bullets are highly visible and only manage to blend into the background a little during the prequel mission, which doesn't really count.  Every stage of the game has its own style and character, and often employs appropriate environmental hazards.  Difficulty is reasonably paced- a modest challenge in story mode ranging to reasonably merciless in arcade mode.  Overall, an extremely fun and aesthetically pleasing game executed with solid consistency.  Most certainly the sort of game that will keep me coming back for more.","February 22, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are absolutely stunning with robust bullet-hell game play. The game's main mechanic is time. The damage you take will drain the amount of time left and the timer can be replenished by killing opponents, picking up powerups, or by destroying components of a boss. The levels are fairly short with epic bossfights during and at the end of any given segment.\n\nIf you hunger for a challenge and some added replay value, you have some epic arcade action on the "difficult" or "insane" difficulties. The story mode should take a novice 3-4 hours to finish, but experienced players might get that down to about 2.\n\nThis game, unlike most of the titles in the bullet-hell genre has a story. A quite complex one, introducing us to a war between two civilizations where time travel is possible. Although hard to follow, as the story is mostly told through blocks of English text with Hungarian narration, it is well worth the effort. The choice of leaving in the Hungarian voiceovers was a deliberate design-decision, as I am led to believe, but it adds a layer of other-worldliness to the game.\n\nThe characters themselves are portrayed as anthropomorphic animals, ranging from  buffalos to bears, cheetahs and a variety of others. In arcade mode, you will be able to chose one of 3 planes all of which have different shot patterns as you level your main weapon through powerups, and the pilot you chose has a unique secondary attack.\n\nWhether you're a casual player, or a hard-core bullet-hell veteran, I suggest picking up a copy of this game. With many ways of scoring big points and a fun, intriguing campaign, the game will draw you in. What are you waiting for?

(And Im not even a huge fan of the genre). Its simplicity is what makes it really shine. You have three buttons: Shoot, special weapon, and "time capsule", which slows down time for as long as you hold the button. Since that meter runs out quickly it has to be used sparingly. But since you control how long you use it for, it becomes a resource that you really need to closely manage.\n\nLevels look great and the overall design is very visually appealing. The switching between characters/vehicles within a level is genius. It really helps the flow of the game. Add to that multiple boss fights during a level and multi-level bosses (all that go fairly quickly) really make the game go by fast without making the game itself out-of-control fast. It switches things up before you get too bored with your current surroundings and challenges. Another genius move from the developers.\n\nThis is probably the best side-scrolling shooter I have played in a long time. I got it on-sale for a few dollars from Humble Bundle. But even at its full price (I think approx. $10) its well worth it. If I had paid full price I wouldnt have been disappointed at all.\n\nI have only played a few levels. Just enough to get caught by the clock (and get stuck at a point that I cant get beyond). Of course, I played on the "Novice" setting and was just starting to think "this is way too easy" and thats when it kicked me in the pants.\n\nI havent found any negative points for this game.

The campaign is short (around 3h), although it's clear that the main part in games like this is in arcade mode to beat records, it still could be little bit longer. The campaign has interesting story, something that would fit better on some scifi RPG than on shoot em up game. It's strange that the last boss is way too easy, many of the minibosses are much harder.

The time system is usually too forgiving, making long boring sections of stages with a few meagre enemies where there's no threat of death whatsoever, and is completely useless when most of the deaths you'll have is due to false difficulty when you hit what you thought was a piece of the background and explode instantly. So everything in the game takes away time when you get hit... except tiny bits of tile that blend in with the background? I don't know how the game manages to be easy to get through, yet so frustrating and unfulfilling at the same time. It just doesn't feel as though it tests your skills as a player.\n\nThe worst part of this game's design, though, is the scoring. Enemies will drop power-ups and points at random, and the point items themselves are randomized as well, to go from somewhere around 1000 points to 100000, I think. Even as more of a casual shmup player I can see how terrible this idea was: point systems should NEVER have this kind of rng involved. With no reliable scoring, half the brilliance of enjoying shmups is gone down the drain.\n\nOne last thing to mention: the story is also a mess. It's not one of those "you just don't get it" stories: there's barely anything to get. I do like the designs of the pilots as anthro animals (hi StarFox), but why do that when all the other characters appear to be human? Seriously, look in the backgrounds and you'll see that the little people walking around are definitely 100% human - was that something they just forgot about?\n\nWhile far from unplayable, Sine Mora isn't going to get much more time from me at all. Even on Steam there are much better shmups, such as Ikaruga and Kamui, and outside of it there are of course hundreds of other great titles available.

If you're not then there are things to consider. The game has a striking 2.5D art style coupled with creative boss designs. A story exists sans character development primarily due to how short the game is. This meant I didn't really care how the story panned out. Most newcomers will complete it in 2 hours. Additional gripes are how projectiles will sometimes blend into the backdrop and the existence of 1 or 2 bad levels (cave laser dodging). Challenging levels but simply not enjoyable. Some of your attacks have visual lunacy but the ones you use most often are pretty bog standard which is a shame. All things considered get it if you want to get into the genre, since it gets discounted down to a measly $2.50 during sales.","June 14, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But as much as I would normally say that this is a bad thing Sine Mora uses this to its advantage, as previously said this game is absolutely ball busting hard even on the lowest difficulty and I don't even want to go in to how hard the highest is. The achievements you can get in this game as well reflective this difficulty making it all the more satisfying when you get those achievements and succeed in get the higher ranks in a stage. The gameplay is your basic SHUMP with your upgradable weaponry and visually stunning super moves to help clear the screen or do more damage. The thing that sets Sine Mora apart from the others is its ability to manipulate time allowing you to dodge barrage of bullets easier as well as think your next step or two ahead of time. The game also has not only spectacular visual that engross you as well as some amazing music to accompy you. The game also offers some amazing boss fights and some decent variety in patterns of its bullets requiring some fancy flying. The story however can be a bit confusing and distracting as the entire cast of what might as well be an adult version of the star fox team speak in a different language and requires the player to read the subtitles to understand the story (which is no problem personally for me). But for a SHUMP the story is very complex and does have some interesting characters to go with it.\nOverall Sine Mora is a great example of a modern SHUMP that neither sacrifice story for graphics or graphics for story and is a good buy for both hardcore SHUMP fans and those interested in getting into the series as long as you’re ready to get your reproduction organs smash to bits.","May 28, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABabyEater/recommended/207040/","ABabyEater","ABabyEater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABabyEater/","716 products in account","Oh man, where do I start.\n\nLet me preface this by stating that I am no stranger to intentionally difficult games; that I have over 500 hours logged in the Souls Series; and that I am familiar with and have played several bullet-hell style games.\n\nThe Pros\nThe art in this game is absolutely fantastic, with it's own unique style, it makes everything interesting to look at, even the small trees and shrubs you pass by.\nThe Bullet-Hell implementation of this game reminds me of the classic Gradius 3 for Super Nintendo that I often played growing up, however, it is unique enough in atmosphere and level design that it is completely its own.\nPrice. For $10, the devs have clearly understood that this game is SHORT and that they aren't expected to have released particularly much.\nThe Cons\nWhile the art in this game is incredibly well done, there was constant texture flickering throughout the entire game, making it difficult to play for very long without getting a headache. No, the flickering was not on one thing or another, it was all over the place. In the background, in the foreground, all over foliage, on almost every partially-transparent texture. It was horrendous.\nPlot, or rather, the significant lack of plot. The story telling in this game is extremely convoluted and difficult to grasp, with the majority of it conveyed as walls of text between levels. Much isn't explained, everything from the player's motivation for the entire first half of the game, to how an anthropomorphic Buffalo fathered an anthropomorphic Cheetah. Nothing seems well thought out, or it could be that everything was so extremely over built that it stopped feeling whole.\nMechanics and Gameplay. Right from the start the "tutorial," if it can be called such a thing, consisted of exclusively the controls. There was no indication of how to survive, or that your timer was actually your "health" bar, gaining time as you destroyed enemies and losing large chunks of time when you got hit. One of the most vital points of bullet-hells is the hitbox, the point where players actually take damage if hit by a projectile. Despite absolutely needing explanation of where this is, especially with the entire screen being covered by projectiles with gaps less than a third the size of your character, there was no way, no explanation of where you would get hit, and by extension, how to manuvre through the map safely. Whenever other mechanics were added to the game, there was NEVER any explanation of how to utilize them, including a stealth portion. Yes, a stealth portion in a bullet hell.\nThe 2.5D implementation. With such amazing art, it is so sad that this game does such a poor job at distinctly portraying what is in the background vs what is in the foreground. This issue makes the game extremely difficult to not feel sore when an enemy destroys the player without warning, simply by "phasing" into the foreground without warning.\nFinal Thoughts\nWith such a great artist, it is a shame that the developers did not put more care into making this a true gem. Everything feels smashed together, with poorly done albeit unique mechanics, and an overall sloppy quality of work. I would not recommend this game for anything more than $2.50, or less than 75% off.","July 5, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
