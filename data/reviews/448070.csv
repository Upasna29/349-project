"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/448070/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Red Risk is a top-down action game made by Microblast Games (Dead Bits, Overcast, Particula). When I think of hell then flames, go-go dancers, and demonic beasts come up to my mind; and Red Risk fulfilled my image of hell.\n\nYou play as one of the three characters, each with specific weapon (axe, pistol or sniper rifle) and unique skill. Red Risk tournament starts immediately as you are thrown into the arena - you have to survive through rounds, while taking care of your health, ammo, starve and thirst (stats are regained at a specific place in the arena for credits you get for surviving).\n\nThe developers chosen pretty uncomfortable controls, as you have to use one mouse button to move, and the second button to attack. Keyboard is just used for your special ability and to check your stats.\n\nEven though the game is obviously low-budget and the graphics style is not terrible as you could expect, the animations make it look pretty bad in action. Your melee character will swing his axe like he would be on drugs, enemy characters usually attack just by making weird moves next to you. Those moves might seem funny, but they're actually taking your health down, of course.\n\nRanged characters in the game play pretty bad, as they share the same controls with the melee character, except they have to reload their weapons. It seems that they are made with thought for the co-op multiplayer, as they are pretty weak on their own, especially the sniper.\n\nAs I've already mentioned, the graphic style is not that bad until something moves, and there's also indifferent heavy metal soundtrack, that even for a metalhead might feel cheesy, but it does its job. There's several arenas where you can get access after you level up (by killing enemies in unlocked arenas), so you can expect getting few hours of playtime from this, if you'll be having fun. Also, there are three difficulties that indicate the health and attack of your enemies.\n\nRed Risk, as it is, isn't worth recommending. It's a slighty below mediocre top-down action game with bad animation and uncomfortable controls. Also, another important thing to mention is the fact that the developers are known for permanently lowering price of their games shortly after release, so if you are interested, you still might want to wait. (Source:  Price history on SteamPrices[www.steamprices.com]; Selling  thousands of keys for giveaways/random key deals)\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Red Risk was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 6","false","4.5"," 140 of 173 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","140","173","4","7"

That's right im talking about WASD keys. There is nothing. You have given ONE movement / move key which is RIGHT Mouse button, lol? and LEFT mouse button for shooting, that's right! It's so stressful to run away and at the same time trying to aim properly and shoot without getting cought or killed. You just can't spam your LMB to shoot, no you actually have to aim your coursor on zombies to shoot them.\nOkay, back to WASD disscusion on forums, so that thread was started back in March and there still isn't any reply back from Dev whatsoever. So yea.\n\nIf you still want to get this game, i suggest you to do more research on it.\n\nA Fine investment!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BL00DBATH/recommended/448070/","BL00DBATH","Jelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BL00DBATH/","529 products in account","Opening up the game you start off at the character select screen before proceeding to the main menu. That's right, you don't have dyslexia, you read it right. Some programmer who doesn't understand UX, probably doesn't even play games, was given the responsibility of creating the graphical user interface. Hey at least it saves them a few dollars, but where they were spent I couldn't say. Probably at a ♥♥♥♥♥house. I opened up steam overlay to see how easy it is to find ♥♥♥♥♥s in Microblast's home town of Brazil and found that the game's black borders for non 16:9 resolutions are more along the lines of memory leaks than actual black borders, as the overlay forever remains imprinted on those black strips of abyss. Abysmal.\n\nBut what does a few near optionless menus really matter compared to the actual game? Let's head online to find out- ha ha no I'm kidding of course. This game cannot outrun the cruel fate of all indie games everywhere, there's no one to play with online. That's OK though, there's single-player; let me give you a walkthrough:\n\nStep one: Run in circles as zombies spawn and trail slowly behind you, repeat until they no longer spawn.\nStep two: Shoot zombies as you run in circles. Oh, and here's a tip, the game doesn't tell you this on the button layout screen which displays every single time you start a game, but you have to press R to reload. If you're using sniper-rifle-guy this means spamming R non-stop because your gun has but one bullet. Where I'm from, when there's only one bullet left in a gun, it's called a suicide bullet.\nStep three: Go to step one.\nElse: Uninstall.","April 13","false","0.3"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","74","35","47","16","5"

When you play it, you can easily imagine how is hell looks , because all creature well create that felling.\n\nIn game you will not find any story, here you just should killing a monsters what comes in waves. You will find here three playable characters with different skills and combat style. When you play, you should pay attention for some things : health, ammo, starve, thirst. You can pick up a filler for each one from a monsters or buy it between rounds for credit.\n\nIn game controls are a little uncomfortable for moving  and attack you should use a mouse, a keyboard you can use only for a special skills. The problems with controls you can really feel when you play with range characters.\n\nThe graphic and sound in  game not the best, but can beat a avarege level.\n\nSo my verdict:\n\n+steam cards and achievements\n+coop\n+creepy atmosphere\n\n-controls\n-game mechanism\n-replay value\n\nWell this kind of game not that what you want to start play again and again, for a small time its can bring a some fun for you, but only if you like this game style. Controls i think really bad, i hope this been resolved closely. Well i think if its get a bigger discount and you like this style or you like collecting games, you will can buy it.","March 9","true","4.3"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","35","57","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dwolfy666/recommended/448070/","dwolfy666","Dwolfy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dwolfy666/","3453 products in account","Short Review (tl;dr)\nRecommended!\n\nIn Red Risk you participate in tournaments where you must survive several waves of “infected”, in 10 action filled rounds – all with a thrilling soundtrack.\n\nYou can choose between 3 characters with different skills and gameplay styles, 3 difficulty modes and 7 arenas that will be unlocked once you complete a few tournaments (you win “rank points” at the end of each tournament, which will be used to unlock new arenas).\n\nIt’s a pretty fun fast paced game, both on singleplayer and on co-op modes.\n\nDetailed Review\nYou can choose between 3 characters with different gameplay styles – each with a type of gun (melee, short range or long range) and a special skill. Your progress (number of infected killed, survival time, rank points, etc) is linked to the player, not to the characters, so you can change your gameplay style at any time.\n\nBefore starting a tournament, you’re able to choose between 3 difficulty modes – painless, scratches or bloody. Also, the rounds on a tournament get increasingly harder.\n\nThere are many types of enemies with different characteristics – some have a lot of HP but are slow, others are fast but weak, some spawn other enemies when killed, bosses have special skills, etc.\n\nThere is a mini-map that shows the location and type of enemies. Since it can be turned on and off, the players have the option to use it or not (hardcore players may choose not to use it).\n\nInside the arenas there is a “store” (rack), where you can recharge your HP, ammunition, hunger or thirst. The “currency” used to do that is “credits”, earned at the end of each round. The “store” remains opened throughout the tournament (not only during the breaks), and that’s pretty useful to recharge ammunition or HP in dangerous situations. Also, every time an enemy dies, it drops a pill that regenerates life, thirst or hunger.\n\nThere are 7 different arenas, each with its specific characteristics. New arenas get unlocked once you accumulate enough “rank points”, which are obtained by completing all 10 rounds in a tournament. The amount of points earned depends on the difficulty mode that you’re playing (painless – 500; scratches – 1,000; bloody – 2,000).\n\nThe soundtrack fits in with the gameplay, and in case the player doesn’t like it, it can be turned off in the options menu.\n\n*PORTUGUÊS*\nAnálise Resumida (tl;dr)\nRecomendo!\n\nEm Red Risk você participa de torneios onde deve sobreviver a várias hordas de “infectados”, em 10 rounds de muita ação – tudo ao som de uma empolgante trilha sonora.\n\nVocê pode escolher entre 3 personagens com habilidades estilos de jogo especiais diferentes, 3 modos de dificuldade e 7 arenas que vão sendo liberadas à medida que você completa torneios (você ganha “rank points” ao final de cada torneio, que serão usados para liberar arenas novas).\n\nUm jogo de ritmo acelerado extremamente divertido, tanto no modo singleplayer quanto no modo co-op.\n\nAnálise Detalhada\nÉ possível escolher entre 3 personagens com estilos de jogo diferentes – cada um tem um tipo de arma (curto, médio ou longo alcance) e uma habilidade especial. Seu progresso (nº de infectados mortos, tempo de sobrevivência, rank points, etc) está associado ao jogador, e não ao personagem, então você pode mudar seu estilo de jogo a qualquer hora.\n\nAntes de começar uma partida, pode-se escolher entre três níveis de dificuldade - painless, scratches ou bloody. Além disso, a dificuldade dos rounds de uma fase é crescente.\n\nExistem vários tipos de inimigos com características distintas – alguns tem muito HP mas são lentos, outros são velozes mas fracos, alguns “spawnam” monstros menores quando morrem, os bosses tem skills especiais, etc.\n\nHá um mini-mapa que mostra a localização e o tipo de inimigo. Como não está habilitado o tempo inteiro, dá opção ao jogador de usá-lo ou não (jogadores hardcore, por exemplo, podem preferir não usá-lo).\n\nDentro das arenas há uma “loja” (rack), onde você pode recarregar HP, munição, sede e fome. A “moeda” usada para fazer isso são créditos, ganhos no final de cada round. O “rack” fica aberto durante toda a partida (não apenas nos “intervalos”), então é bem útil para recarregar munição ou HP em situações perigosas. Além disso, sempre que um inimigo morre, dropa uma pílula que regenera vida, sede ou fome.\n\nExistem 7 arenas diferentes, cada uma com características específicas. Novas arenas vão sendo liberadas à medida que você acumula “rank points”, obtidos ao completar todos os 10 rounds de um torneio. A quantidade de pontos ganhos depende do nível de dificuldade jogado (painless – 500; scratches – 1.000; bloody – 2.000).\n\nA trilha sonora combina bem com o gameplay, e caso o jogador não goste, a música de fundo pode ser desligada no menu de opções.","March 4","true","15.9"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","29","48","0","0"

No. What?!\nTHEY HAVE STRIPPERS!!! Which most likely you never saw one in real life tho\n\nI love the songs in this game <3\n\nLet's get back to the game:\nYou can choose between three characters: Elise, Jason and Walter\n\nElise: Is a sexy woman that I love it. It has a pistol with 12 bullets, she has piercings and a hot looking. She is the perfect character for killing hordes, because her range is big enough to kill, but also reloads very fast which is good for hordes, right?\nLet's not forget about her special attack: Shoots faster for a period of time!\nBut she has not a powerful weapon unfortunately :\\n\nJason: Is a tough guy. His weapon is an AXE! He is a low range character, which it gets kinda difficult when is stuck.

NOW, to the game's style, the music scheme is rock and the game's graphics are very good actually, the movement and shooting is controlled by mouse but some actions require a keyboard, the ranking up in this game is very easy and it has easy achievments, the infected spawn as waves and you can regain your health by picking up pills dropped by dead enemies or buying health during timeouts between waves, it's fun to play especially when played with friends and there are 10 arenas (i think) which are unlockable by gaining XP, but i got to admit i have seen some glitches in it like the infected ignores you or keeps pushing you (not damaging you) and a visual glitch when the platform disappers and something like that but in an overall i would absolutely recommend this game, if you're willing to spend a nice time with friends this is the game that you need.","March 13","true","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's downright awful and an immediate regret. I bought it because it was cheap and I was looking to see if I could find a gem as I often do on Steam. I read the reviews and figured if this many people like it, how bad can it be? It can be really bad, trust me.\n\nIt's not even the graphics or subpar animations that bother me, it's simply the core gameplay itself. Terrible controls,  every enemy I've ecountered so far will only attack you by melee, and it doesn't even look appealing when they do so. With the sniper rifle, you have to press "R" EVERY time you shoot to reload.\n\nThere was even an enemy that would constantly stun you, so if you were to play with the melee character you'd have to constantly run away and heal, though the monster stunning you can catch up to you with each stun, no matter how far you run away.\n\nThis brings me to another point: each character only has one weapon. If you were expecting different and better guns any character can use, you'll be just as disappointed as me.\n\nThis game was clearly meant to be multiplayer but I wouldn't dream of convincing a friend to waste his money on this.\n\nI did like the way the enemies actually looked, but that's about all the good I can say for this game.\n\n","March 14","false","0.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andreimachado/recommended/448070/","andreimachado","AMOK csgostakes.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andreimachado/","116 products in account","Red Risk is a fun top-down shooter/survival game, with a concept based on waves, in the likes of It came from space and ate our brains and Noct. Your objective is to stay alive in a tournament, where you'll face waves of enemies, that will only get harder. Not a new concept, but that can still be explored.\n\nThe art is good and simple. Everything is toned in red. Quite atmospheric and good-looking.  The monster design is good as well, it fits the universe perfectly.\n\nThe soundtrack is great. Red Risk has a very good instrumental metal original soundtrack, and it fits perfectly in the atmosphere of the game. You never get bored of it.\n\nThe gameplay, while I don't like the controls very much (movement with the mouse click), is fluid most of the times.\n\nEach character has a special weapon, and its not much balanced. I think this is intentional, to provide different ways to play the game and to create a variety in the strategies. Picking a character with a worse weapon can make the game extremely challenging in the beginning, at least until you get used to it.\n\nBut regardless of your character choice, as you progress, the game gets quite challenging anyway. You do have a character progression, based on leveling up, even tho you don't have much control of it. Still, it gives you feeling of improvement instead of simply finishing waves. You also have an inventory and itens to pick up. Not very game changing, but keeps you interested. You get credits that can be used in the stack, a kind of shop, where you can buy "heal wounds", for example, to regain health, or "satisfy hunger".\n\nThe survival aspect is one of the innovative aspects of Red Risk. Besides worrying about the dozens of enemies, and surviving the good and old physical injury, you do have to survive to your basic needs, like hunger or thirst. For that, you can pick up "pills" (hunger pills, water pills) or use your credits in the stack. Either way, it works well and keeps you worried. It is annoying, but that is exactly the objective of the survival mechanics, ain't I right?\n\nThe only problem for me, are the controls, that are a bit clunkly, especially when shooting. Sometimes it feels like the clicks don't register very well (I think its a recoil mechanic that its not much clear how it works as there is not visual indicator). But once this is improved, the overall note on the game can be heavily improved, cause the game has a lot of potential.\n\nThere is nothing much new into it besides the survival mechanics (that works greatly), but its well done enough. Red Risk has still some room for improvement, and I hope some things can be implemented. Especially a change in the controls (I'm not a fan of moving with the mouse), and responsiveness regarding the registering of clicks. By simply making gameplay a bit more fluid, this game can have a lot of potential of being one very fun, simple survival top-down shooter, with a great soundtrack and great atmosphere.\n\nPros:\n- Level design\n- Art in gereral (atmosphere)\n- Soundtrack\n- With a bit polishment, has huge potential\n\nCons:\n- Controls (moviment by mouse)\n- Feels clunky sometimes when shooting\n\nOverall score:\n7.5/10","March 30","true","14.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I don't bother saving these when I write them, so here's the condensed pros/cons and overall rating.\n\nPros:\n\n-Good concept.\n-Awesome monsters, creatures and overall solid graphics.\n-Multiplayer would be awesome...\n-Easy to pick up and play.\n-It's not technically broken and glitches are few (i.e. it'll run, it saved my progress, didn't crash, etc.)\n\nCons:\n\n-Many unfinished ideas (thirst/hunger system, empty inventory screen, etc.)\n-No strategy involved.  Enemies just run at you and are easy.  Sheer numbers disguised as "challenge."  Their attacks are all melee or cheap status FX like poison, stun, etc. from which there is no cure from because there's no inventory system even though it has a button!\n-Terrible controls.  It's an action hack n' slash with hack n' slash RPG controls (left mouse to attack/right mouse to click and move).\n-Huge delay in when you can attack enemies.  You have to target them individually, again like a hack n' slash RPG.  The combat is generally slow, slow, slow.\n-Every arena seems to have the same 10 waves of enemies.\n-Only 2 moves per playable character.\n-For my money, the projectile characters are weak, unbalanced, slow to reload and useless.  If there was multiplayer I could see there being strategy or fun in choosing them but not in single.\n-Zero variety in gameplay which gets boring FAST.\n-Level up system is worthless (your health caps at 200 a few levels in).\n-Game seems to be a month old and NOBODY is playing multiplayer it seems.  That should have warned me.\n-Though the 4.99 budget tag seems tempting, I got more content out of the 99 cent Reveal the Deep than this game.\n\nOverall:  3/10\n\nThis game is POOR and because my review wouldn't post here for whatever reason, someone deleted it in the discussions.  Obviously the developer.  I feel ripped off even for 4.99.  There's no variety, no strategy, every arena is more or less the same with just different graphics, no moves, no inventory, no point to most of the gameplay decisions etc.  Where this game could really shine is in multiplayer but a month after it's out and nobody is playing.  As a single-player game I'll slash through it for a bit just because I spent the money but even Gauntlet and Hunter: The Reckoning seem like tactical marvels when compared to Red Risk.  You won't even need to manage thirst/hunger because you'll find enough pick-ups to do so.  Even if there were a few items like a room clearing bomb or some once and done abilities it would have upped the fun quotient.  You hack through an arena, earn enough points to enter the next slightly different looking one and fight (thus far) the exact sames waves as the arena before.  I mean...it feels like there was minimal effort put into making the game which is a shame because even though the monsters are mindless, they are pretty cool looking (especially the bosses).\n\nEven diehard hack n' slash fans should avoid this one.  Without the ability for 2-3 player co-op you're going to get bored fast.  I'm going to at least try to get another arena in (I've earned 500 points thus far in the second one), but if things don't change after that this is getting uninstalled.  I should pursue a refund like I did with Kidnapped (which I couldn't even finish due to glitches and got my money back), but I'll play this some more begrudingly and consider it a lesson learned.  It's a real letdown as the premise of this game reads like a modern day Smash TV which is one of my favorite shoot 'em ups of all time!  This game isn't even a 1/12th the game that the Smash TVs were!","April 22","false","5.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

You have to be really fast to avoid them. I couldn't have the chance of test the multiplayer or local, mI think\nMusic: Rock'n roll! Just great for the scenes of killing and blood! I think the music is the best of the game.\nGraphics: I like them, the art concept is cool and goes great with the game. The monitor starts to being covered in blood!\n\nGameplay\n\nIt's a pretty difficult game if you play solo. You can reload ammo but takes a little to select what you want to do. Also, you can heal wich is good, but I think using keyboard controls would be faster.\nHere you have several options about characters. Long and short range are great, I prefer long range weapons but you have to refill ammo and don't take long there or zombies gonna kill you!\nMaybe in multiplayer you could have the chance of use more strategy with your team, pity I never find servers when I'm online.\n\nArenas are quite good, and the first one if you are fast you can pass it. The rest, well are very difficult. It's practise I guess.\n\nPros\n\n+ Great Music\n+ Different characters\n\nCons\n\n- The "E" for refill, cure, etc it's quite complicated sometimes, you cannot see anything\n- Too many zombies for a single player!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIt's a great game and funny.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/448070/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Here we have another overhead shooter, and you know what? I'm perfectly alright with that. Shootemups are among my most-played genre, and I'm always on the lookout for something new and interesting. Although a game might consist of standard fare like shooting aliens, zombies, or - in Red Risk's case - demons, there's usually a handful of unique qualities that set it apart from the pack. Unfortunately, Red Risk stands out by being really bad.\n\nOnly a few people are ruthless enough to survive wave after wave of the damned, in the Underworld's favorite game show. Upon starting this game, you'll be prompted to create a profile and choose a character. Each of the three contestants has their own weapon and special ability. If you want to win, my advice is to choose Elise. If you pick either Jason or Walter, and attempt to play alone, then you're almost guaranteed to fail. More on that in just a moment.\n\nTwo of the contestants carry guns, which leads to one of the interesting but flawed aspects of Red Risk. In order to shoot a demon, you have to be standing still. Aiming is extremely simple, because all you have to do is hold the left mouse-button and drag the cursor on-top of a monster. You can't waste bullets even if you want to. Reloading is also instantaneous as long as you continue mashing the "r" key. The thing is, I don't mind that the contestants can't shoot while moving, nor that they can't be controlled with a "WASD" setup. The problems start happening due to balance issues and poor mechanics.\n\nElise, the handgun user, is far better than the other two characters, and this can be attributed almost entirely to poor design-decisions. Walter carries a sniper rifle and has to reload after every shot. His special ability allows him to shoot a row of enemies at once. The problem is that unlike regular-shooting, he has to be facing the general direction of the enemy he wants to hit. This means that he actually has to clumsily move to face the enemy, then take the shot. You could fire one regular-shot to help center your aim, but then you have to reload, and then make sure that your finger is not holding down the mouse-button (special abilities are triggered with the space bar). This convoluted process crops up constantly, and will result in you taking a lot of damage.\n\nJason uses an axe. His special ability is a spin-attack. While this contestant has twice as much health than the other two, he's going to get hurt far more often. Monsters don't actually swing their arms, grab at the player, or do anything that could inflict pain. If they get close enough, then you'll probably lose some life. The axe behaves similarily to the guns, Jason won't swing unless the cursor is hovering over a nearby monster. This disconnected feeling makes melee much harder than it should be. When combat is this inconsistent, your best bet is to stay as far away as possible.\n\nSo now we turn to Elise. Her special ability allows her to fire her gun at an extremely fast rate for a few seconds. This ability doesn't have a cool-down period, and it'll chew through the toughest monsters. As long as you keep mashing that reload key, and pressing the space-bar every few seconds, you'll coast through almost every wave.\n\nAlongside the minor creatures that shamble towards you, there are a few elite boss monsters. These abominations have some unique attribute that isn't designed well at all. In wave 6, you'll face an elite that stuns you every few seconds. There is absolutely nothing you can do about getting stunned. Only Elise and her magic pistol has a chance, and things can still go wrong. As I mentioned earlier, players can't move while shooting. If Elise (or Walter) is getting pushed by a monster, that counts as moving. In wave 5, there's a giant fiend that sprays poison everywhere, which you also can't hope to avoid. The wave 8 boss is a giant spider. This creature can stun the player, but it has almost half the health of the earlier boss, which doesn't make much sense. The wave 10 boss is just one long game of keep-away. This cow-looking monster is pretty fast, and he gets a little help from some friends, but he's still pretty easy.\n\nUpon surviving these ten waves, you win the tournament and are awarded points. Said points can unlock new maps. These newer locations have different layouts, but the waves are the exact same. Changing the difficulty just gives most creatures more hit-points. Once you figure out how to survive those ten waves, there's really nothing else to look out for. I suppose playing with other people online could make the game slightly more interesting, but what's more liable to happen is that everyone will be bored. As long as somebody chooses Elise, and abuses her special ability, then the only potential threat is the wave 6 boss.\n\nRed Risk tries to have a survival element, by requiring that the player stay hydrated and nourished. After each wave, the player is awarded a point, which can be used towards health, ammo, food, or water. You're never going to need to waste those precious points on anything but health and ammo. Your hunger & thirst gauges are easily managed by the copious pills left behind by the undead. I don't mind the idea, but when there's no follow-through, it's just an unnecessary distraction.\n\nEven with all of these major issues, I still have a couple nitpicks to share. As if playing the Sniper wasn't bad enough, most enemies have odd amounts of HP, like 238, 340, and even 105. I'm complaining about this because the Sniper's bullets do 100 points of damage each. I think this guy would be far more effective if the monsters didn't require so many additional shots; having monsters with 100, 200, and 300 HP seems far more sensible. Sometimes when a demon is killed, its corpse can fall over top of other monsters, which stops you from shooting.\n\nI understand that Red Risk was developed by one person, and it has some nice qualities like the music and atmosphere. The dancing girls are an amusing touch as well. However, there are far too many issues with this game for me to recommend it.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 23","false","9.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Red Risk can be a fun game. However, there are some design choices that I don't agree with and I believe they kind of break the game.\n\nBut first, I will start with a list of pros:\n1. The soundtrack is pretty cool and I really enjoy it (although the tracks sound very similar)\n2. Decent concept; you are part of a game show where you need to survive waves of zombies and monsters\n3. Nice dark style (This game isn't called RED Risk for no reason)\n\nQuite honestly, that is all for the list of pros, at least for now.\n\nThe cons/suggestions for improvement are as follows:\n1. Drops need to have a better indication that they are there\n2. The game can really use a "run and gun" mechanic\n3. It was unclear how to obtain rank points\n4. The basic action needs to be updated... (It would work better if the mouse indicator wasn't the exact spot that your weapon hits. For the axe, left clicking should make you automatically swing and hit whatever is in it's path. For the guns, left clicking should shoot in whatever direction you are pointing. The would make the game smoother and, ultimately, more fun.)\n5. Another suggestion... It would be cool if the game kept separate stats for each character as well as an aggragate total for your profile.\n6. Animations need to be clearer... (There is no indication that you are getting hurt besides the screen dimming. The monsters don't make any special movement. Also, the character you control isnt very animated either. There needs to be an indication that you are swinging your axe as opposed to using your special ability.)\n\nI will keep an eye on this game to see how the development process progresses.

The graphic is great and the characters.\nHowever , I don't like the music at the game menu. It's really annoying and my ears almost deaf.\nThe idea of the game is brillant but if the game is in first person view. It's actually really good.\nBut the one part that I really don't like is the control. I'm getting sick of it.\nIt's a good game , and at the same it sucks.","June 2","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's horrible.\n\nThe controls are awkward (right click to move forward in what direction you face)..\n\nThe combat is super clunky and very slow, not fluid or responsive at all.  Ugh.  This game would be bad in 1998, but in 2016.. it's just inexcusable.\n\n\nMy Scoring System Used On This Game:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nValue: 7 out of 40.. Clunky, slow combat and dull all-red maps make this game play as boring as it looks.\n\nFun: 5 out of 30.. This is a generous score, trust me.. how much fun is slow, awkard and non-responsive gameplay?\n\nControls & Bugs: 5 out of 20.. Controls are a nightmare, why not WASD or the ability to at least define your movement to something besides this idiotic control system?  Clunky slow controls.. left click to attack, 5 seconds later your avatar attacks.  ouch.\n\nGraphics & Sound: 3 out of 10.. Both the graphics and sound look and sound muddy and blurred.  Not visually appealing at all.\n\nMY TOTAL SCORE: 20%   - GOD AWFUL, STAY FAR AWAY, EVEN AT 50 CENTS THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH IT.","March 4","false","0.1"," 19 of 41 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","19","41","5","7"

It was cheap, so we figured, how bad could it be?\n\nIt's ♥♥♥♥ing awful. One out of ten. Blew away my expectations of how bad a game could really be.\n\nFirst impression: the music sucks. I want to be nice about it, but I can't. It's GARBAGE. Every single stereotype about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ noisy metal is true with this game. I muted it immediately. There is a way to do good heavy metal, and this game does not know how.\n\nThe concept isn't terrible, but the arenas and monsters look uninspired, the oversaturation of red hurts the eyes, and it's just... boring. There is no reason or backstory for the characters, barely any explanation of monsters, and above all NOTHING motivating the players to play. Not to mention, the controls are weird and don't make sense to the brain. We all kept trying to use WASD to move.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game to anyone. My friends and I were only able to play it for 15 minutes before we were bored to ♥♥♥♥ing tears.","May 22","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
