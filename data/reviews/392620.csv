Then I found out it's one of those where you don't interact during battles. And then I found out it's actually not a card game at all.\nWhat is it though? It's a strategical combat puzzle game, where you place up to 5 characters with different stats and special skills in a specific formation in order to fight an opposing team. You don't interact during the battle, it automatically plays out following specific rules. So the gameplay consists of figuring out a good team combination and and formation to overcome your opponents. Thanks to pretty interesting mechanics and a good variety of very different characters this is a surprisingly interesting task.\ntl;dr: This game is probably not what you expected, but it's actually pretty good at what it does.\nMore Details:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeysHgyCyxE","October 25, 2015","true","8.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

You build a team of up to 5 cards and they automatically battle against the other team.  It's all about match ups, and there is no "best combination".  You're always tweaking your card set up depending on what you're up against.  When it comes to the multiplayer, there are no microtransactions, and it's not pay to win in anyway, although it's hard to do well in a league if you don't have a lot of cards.  You set up a team and it fights against other players.  You get cards by playing the campaign, and you can go through it multiple times.  I find that it's a game that is best enjoyed in small chunks, 5 - 10 minutes at a time.\n\nIf you go in not expecting too much, it really is a wonderful game and one month later, I find myself checking up on it just as much as I did when I purchased it.","January 3","true","29.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

We could use some more Draft players so if you like Card Games jump on this! There are absolutly no micro-transactions and you get a steady feeling of progress. Even the campaign story is not bad at all. The automatic battles are not hampering the fun btw. You have enough to do without the tedious manual battles like in other Card Games. It is really not taking the fun away from this game!\n\nUpdate: I have soon ended the campaing and I think that this has a great replayability as you will get other cards on a new run. These cards also add up in your collection which lets you upgrade your cards to create even better decks for the league. I still think there are to few players in draft and that the league takes to long but I guess both will not change, now that the game did not impress a lot of people on steam.","October 18, 2015","true","34.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","5"

(The solo campaign demo, free, took about 5 or 6 hours and it was easier than the later stages.)  I normally play turn based strategy games like Civ 5, so this game has a much lighter and more casual feel, but it's still very intellectually engaging.   It's mostly a card game with a loose framework of a storyline and a fantasy campaign setting.  The gameplay where you will be spending 90-95% of your time is somewhere between tactical combat and puzzle solving.  I find myself saying things like "Well, that didn't work, maybe I will try deploying my berserker opposite that elven archer, so he will lose some HP and start attacking more vigorously, because I need their ghouls to die before their skeletons so they don't keep getting hit point boosts..."  and "Dammit, the fire tribe engineer can't be placed next to the air-aligned ballista to repair it."   Also, "I'm stuck on the campaign map, I just don't have enough 1-point cards to fill out a solid team after choosing my best vampire leader and the armor cracker and the druid.  Even after trying all the different spells I still can't bring down their healer fast enough.  So I guess it's time to go PVP to build up some more gold and buy more cards."   Some other reviewers have criticized the art; it's admittedly an odd mix of "old masters", anime, and classic dark fantasy art.  But, for less than $10, this is a great buy.  Lots of fun, thought provoking gameplay.   A very smooth, bug-free gaming experience, both PVE and PVP.  Check it out!","January 25","true","410.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is unlike anything else I have ever played, but I have found it quite enjoyable to try to come up with an army formation that can beat each challenge.
