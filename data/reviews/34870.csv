The campaign is highly story driven and will escort you from scene to scene as you progress; don’t expect an open world, or much freedom to explore in the main game.  (The DLC expansion, however, does provide a more open-world experience).  There is also a multiplayer mode which did have a small number of active players at the time I played this.\n\nWhat I found most enjoyable about Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 was the main campaign.  I really enjoyed the simple storyline, the pacing of the game, and the landscapes which you explore.  The graphics may not be the absolute best, but I really found the levels to be attractive and interesting.  The story wasn’t earth-shatteringly good but it kept me interested throughout my playthrough.  The story guides you through narrow-pathed levels as events unfold.  Don’t expect to be able to do much exploration or anything; although, there are some hidden collectibles to search for (even then: scarcely off the main path).\n\nYou are a sniper, so most of the gameplay revolves around moving (stealthily) from one sniper spot to the next, picking off enemies as effectively as possible.  There are stance, breathing, gravity, and wind mechanics that are taken into consideration when you snipe.  And you are supposed to snipe… you won’t be able to "Rambo" through the game, even on easy.  That said, the game is pretty forgiving and has decently placed checkpoints, so even on hard it shouldn’t be overwhelming.  In fact, some people may actually find the game too easy— as the AI is pretty predictable and most scenarios can be swiftly dealt with before they even are aware of your presence.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode.  There were a few dozen people playing at a time on the occasions that I checked it out.  It certainly can have its moments, but when you have a 5 on 5 (or less) of all snipers, it can get pretty dull.  It was a little too slow for my personal tastes, but I am sure it can be quite enjoyable for those who would appreciate the style of PVP gameplay.\n\nSniper: Ghost Warrior 2 offers a fun campaign that will take you on a ride and offer a brief FPS experience focused on stealth and sniping.  If that sounds like fun, you will probably enjoy what this has to offer.  I wouldn’t, however, expect much from the multiplayer experience.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","June 19, 2015","true","11.0"," 119 of 129 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","119","129","6","3"

However, they force me to make a black & white choice and I choose "No Way".  The graphics are pretty good, the basic gameplay is OK but there are a lot of issues:\n\n1.  There are places on the maps you can get stuck and not be able to get out of AND you cannot kill yourself to continue playing the game!  You have to leave the game altogether and rejoin (if you can).\n\n2.  There is no way to kick or ban a player on your own server DURING the game ...you have to wait for the game to be over!  This is the ONLY thing you can do to protect yourself and it isn't even in-the-moment or real-time!\n\n3.  Rampant cheating via engineered hacking/aimbot/God-mode programs ruin any opportunity for the expectation of fair play.  I feel as though I have left more games than I have finished because of these jerks.  I wish them all a horrible painful death in the real world.  They have collectively stolen the money we have invested in this game and Steam does nothing to stop it.  Indeed, the cheaters occasionally talk about such things and defend their own actions on the Discussion channels and you never see a Steam moderator step in and take any action.  They have left us to the wolves.\n\n4.  The "game-view" or "sight-view" (what you see vs. what the enemy sees) is really screwed up.  I can be inside a tunnel with no view of the enemy yet he can see me and kill me.  How is that fair?  My arms and legs aren't hanging out, I am OUT OF SIGHT and even this is no defense.  Being out-of-sight is not even considered stealthy in a game that is BUILT on concept of stealth?\n\n5.  There is no way to configure your own server for "Pistols-Only", "No Pistols" or anything else that would allow different styles of play or game modes for variety.  Every server and every map is largely identical with few deviations.  It quickly  becomes boring.\n\n6.  Character movement and control is full of inconsistencies... in some places you cannot go prone for no aparent reason.  Where you can go prone, while you are crawling on your belly you may encounter a flat board or step in the ground.  Crawling across this change in terrain causes you to STAND UP!  Instant death in many circumstances.  Other places with boards or terrain changes this doesn't happen and you pass right through them.  In some places you cannot go prone, but if you hit "Crouch" it instantly goes prone instead.  VERY inconsistent on a portion of the game that SHOULD be rock-solid in its second version.\n\n7.  Cheaters/hackers/banned players can just make up a new name and continue playing.  How does this help the integrity of the game?  There is no way to stop them and the game LETS them get away with it for as long as they want.\n\nThe game was fun when I first started but now is only occasionally fun and the more I play the more frustrated I get.  There are far too many problems, not enough players, too many cheaters and there is NO support from the developer or this provider so I have decided to stop buying ANY more games like this.  Little quality control or standards seem to be applied and the user pays the price.","November 27, 2013","false","144.0"," 239 of 310 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","239","310","0","8"

Otherwise, the story is not bad, and slightly more down-to-earth than most Call of Duty games of late. Levels are very linear and heavily scripted. You are guided by your spotter who stays at your side most of the time. This provides good immersion and manages to convey the sense of working as a team, but his AI is a bit unreliable when in open combat.\n\nThe scripting is fairly basic and lacks some polish. There were various issues, like dialogue getting cut off, or checkpoints not reloading correctly. A few times my character would confirm over radio that I had the target in my crosshair, but the target was no where to be seen on my screen. The checkpoint save system has the usual irritations associated with such a system. It is also a pity the difficulty settings offer no more options beyond “easy, medium, hard” - I wanted to play “medium”, but without the “red dot” aim assist that ruins the sniping challenge. Also, once you have started, there is no option to change the difficulty later. I had a few crashes to desktop. All these issues were very annoying, but did not ruin the experience.\n\nThe graphics are decent (as you would expect from the CryEngine) but do not quite have the same visual quality as the Crysis games. Some areas look really nice, but others less so. The standard quality setting are poorly optimised. I achieved much better fps after careful tweaking (tip: put “object detail” on low for massive fps boost and next to no quality loss).\n\nControls are ok, but feel a bit clunky and are unresponsive in some contexts. Fortunately there is no mouse lag or acceleration. Weapon handling and ballistics are ok, but not simulator grade. The game lacks a detailed tutorial and you cannot “zero” the sights to various ranges like you can in ARMA and Red Orchestra 2. The simulation of wind on bullets feels artificial because the wind speed is not effectively reflected in the environment - vegetation does not respond accordingly and there are no other indicators like the sound of wind or moving dust etc. The displayed distances seem to be fake - an ingame distance of 400m is actually closer to 200m (a sin many mainstream games commit one way or another to be more accessible to console peasants). Compared to Far Cry 3, this game was clearly made on a smaller budget, with less content, freedom and polish, but in the end I still liked the single player campaign more here. It is more cohesive and serious, while Far Cry 3 was a theme park of absurd sensationalist violence.\n\nOverall this is a decent second-rate game I mildly enjoyed. I had very modest expectations, and it satisfied them. Get it when on sale.","November 22, 2015","true","16.5"," 81 of 93 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","81","93","10","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/34870/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a superior shooter when compared to its predecessor. Granted, that isn't saying much.City Interactive has addressed virtually all of the sore points that made the earlier game miss as often as it hit. This is an accomplished stealthy shooter, with smarter enemy AI, more-realistic sniper physics, and scaled-down difficulty that provide a challenging, not maddening, sniping experience. Only miscues like the spread-out save checkpoints and throwaway multiplayer keep it from achieving greatness.Most of your time with Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 will be spent with the three-part campaign. You play as Cole, a special-ops sniper helping out assault teams in hot zones ranging from the Philippines to Sarajevo to Nepal.A well-written, well-acted script give the game a great action-movie vibe, as do authentic-looking visuals and animations powered by the CryEngine 3. Excellent sound effects do a wonderful job of pulling you in. Weapon noises, the shouts of enemy voices, the far-off rattle of weapon fire and various atmospheric sounds like the background are all handled extremely well and enhance the tension as you line up each careful shot.Shooting is also much more enjoyable, whether you're using a mouse-and-keyboard setup or a gamepad. In the earlier game, bullet drops were extreme, slight winds significantly affected shots, and your heart rate caused the scope to carom all over the place. Here, the physics here are just right.Gameplay is now more focused on stealth than shooting. All of the pure action episodes of the last game have been ditched for a more intense sniping approach where you stay hidden as much as possible, only popping out for quick headshots and silent knife kills. That said, there are some shortcomings. The biggest is the checkpoint system, which saves your progress too infrequently.  The joys of stealth are also occasionally dampened by level linearity.Also you occasionally need to play through particularly tricky parts of levels once or twice before learning enemy patrol patterns which is sometimes frustrating.Multiplayer is pretty much an afterthought. All you get is team deathmatch and a pair of maps. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2's story and stealth make for a satisfying and entertaining single-player campaign. The frustratingly few-and-far-between checkpoints and MIA multiplayer are disappointments, but this is a worthy sniping experience, especially given the game's budget price. Overall 7/10.","September 27, 2014","true","145.1"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","56","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cl4ym4n/recommended/34870/","cl4ym4n","///cl4ym4n.de >:3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cl4ym4n/","1791 products in account","Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a first person shooter that focuses on stealth and sniping and presents itself with quite a couple of improvements over the 2011-released prequel.\n\nThe story is stereotypical modern first person shooter bla bla. Terrorists try to obtain a weapon of mass destruction and you have to stop them before they get the chance to use it... so, really exciting stuff there. While the story is as generic as it can be, the storytelling and the dialogues, combined with the actual gameplay, work out surprisingly well and keep things going without every really boring you to death.\n\nS:GW2 is based on the CryEngine 3 (the same engine used for Crysis 3) and while the original game already looked fairly decent, S:GW2 made an even bigger step forward towards visual quality. The texture detail, lighting and level design of the different locations made me stand still and just look around for a bit more than once.\n\nAlong with the enhanced visuals, the gameplay mechanics also greatly improved. The AI in the prequel was a horrible pain as enemies would spot you through walls or over a distance of hundreds of meters. Thankfully, the AI was completely re-done for S:GW2, so enemies behave like they should and also show some actual intelligence as, depending on the area, they will try to flank you from all sides or hide behind cover. Additionally, if you break the line of sight or hide in foliage, they will start searching for you.\n\nEach of the 'hotspot' areas in the levels provide you with one or more overwatch spots from which you can safely identify your targets and take them out either one by one, 2 with one bullet if they stand in line or even an entire group if you shoot a grenade on one of the enemy's belts. Alternatively, you can also get closer and take them out either with your knife or your silenced sidearm and if you want to be a real Ghost, you just sneak past them so they will never know you were there.\n\nAs the enviroments change, you will have to utilize your thermal or night vision to progress safely and spot your enemies. While this is a nice gimmick and the night vision is often required in really dark areas, I barely used the thermal vision, though it can help spot enemies that blend into the enviroment or are covered by obstacles. The visions are also pretty much the only gadgets you have and while you get C4 charges during certain key points in the game, it feels somewhat lame to not be able to place Claymore mines and lure enemies into them. Or just blow them up with frag grenades.\n\nWhile the prequel had some action-heavy levels where you actually went head-on towards your enemies and mowed them down with your combat rifles, S:GW2 doesn't feature something like that at all. You have to stick with your sniper rifle as your primary weapon at all times and while the game actually is called 'Sniper', I feel like this strict sniper rifle-only thing killed a bit of the gameplay dynamic and possible replayability of the game as it eliminates the option for the player to replay a level and, instead of silently sniping the enemies, just going nuts with an assault rifle and pumping bullets into everything that moves.\n\nI tried to be as stealthy as possible, so the base campaign took me around 6.5 hours to beat. The Siberian Strike DLC, which consists of 3 fairly lengthy levels, added another 2.5 hours on top of it. While a couple people seem to be still playing the multiplayer mode, I can't comment on that as I was never able to join a server and gave up after dozens of tries and a couple attempts to fix it.\n\nAll in all, S:GW2 is a huge improvement over the sequel and seeing what turds City Interactive has produced in the past (prior to S:GW), it's good to see that they can do something decent for a change. If they keep up this level of quality, I might eventually start looking forward to their upcoming games again.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent and good-looking sniper experience, make sure to give S:GW 2 a shot (A shot - get it? Because it's a sniper game... hahahaha. Ah, nevermind).","September 1, 2013","true","9.3"," 84 of 114 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","84","114","0","1"

For someone like me who likes a good Sniper shot from miles away, waiting several seconds up to a minute just for one good shot is okay, everyone else can stop reading here and leave.\nThe game is called Sniper for a reason - because that is what makes 85% of the game. The rest is either running or the occasional kill with a gun or knife.\nThe story is average, nothing big to be expected, but enough to keep the game interesting. I liked the parts where you had to fight your way along a (linear) path, and the game does a good job of giving you the feeling that you're a ♥♥♥♥ing sniper and every shot has to be a killing one. There are some challenging parts but you never feel like there is no way you can make it further unless you really suck at using a sniper rifle or feel the need to blast everything away, because you can't.\n\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nAvoid like ♥♥♥♥ing hell. You'll feel like there is a huge ♥♥♥ blinking sign above your head while your opponents don't even have a visual model.\n\n\nThe game comes with an impressively good soundtrack and nice graphics. If using sniper rifles is what you enjoy most in other shooters this game may be yours, but if you're looking for a fast-paced action game like CoD or CS you're wrong here.\n\nCan recommend the basic game, especially when on sale, but not the expansions and the multiplayer mode.","July 31, 2013","true","2.7"," 50 of 65 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","50","65","0","1"

When you're not moving from shooting position to shooting position in rail-shooter fashion, you're probably in the middle of the incredibly anti-climactic "boss fights." The end of the game comes just as swiftly as it did in Sniper: Ghost Warrior; one second you're shooting some bad guys and the next thing you know the credits come up leaving you unsatisfied and annoyed.\n\nAs for the sniping aspect of the game, it's ridiculously easy on the the easiest and medium difficulties. When I first noticed this I had attempted to switch to expert difficulty and I was initially happy with it. At normal distances the kills were challenging and I couldn't pop off 10 perfect headshots without breaking a sweat like I could on medium difficulty. But as soon as I was faced with the task of picking off targets from 1000 meters away (some requiring quick action with as little as a 3 second notice) the game became borderline impossible.\n\nSo in conclusion: the game is incredibly linear and unsatisfying. If the game had a more open feel like that of the original Sniper Elite and allowed for some actual drama in the plot I'd be more than comfortable giving it a positive vote, but sadly that is not the case.","December 29, 2013","false","8.4"," 55 of 78 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","55","78","0","1"

Single player story offers about 5 hours of entertainment, which actually felt long enough - If the game had more playtime with current features, it would get repetitive.\n\nIn 10 levels you can expect a lot of linear gameplay, with exceptions like parts where you can choose if you want to go through with stealth or shoot everybody (and somehow survive). But expect most parts being based on stealth, as your only weapons are sniper rifle, silenced pistol and knife - all the time.\n\nThis action game is one of the most newbie-friendly action games I've seen lately. Even on normal difficulty the game felt easy, it's hinting you every 100 meters where you should move next. And most of the time you will be on action with your partner (invincible NPC who doesn't do much damage) who will be signalling exactly what you should do - shoot this bad guy, move there, beware of the spotlight etc.\n\nI was actually surprised that for a lower priced action game, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 felt good and had a great atmosphere, made thanks to surprisingly good visuals and well done voice acting. Even the story, though it's not something complex, was interesting and made the game into something more than just another corridor shooter with optional stealth.\n\nSniper Ghost Warrior 2, unlike the previous part, deserves full recommendation if you don't mind the linear gameplay and shorter length. Even those looking for multiplayer might have get some fun there, as I've seen few active deathmatch servers with players. So, what are you waiting for? Take your sniper rifle and go to war!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 13","true","4.8"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","34","43","3","1"

I gave that a negative review even though I tried very hard to like it, but comparing this game to its predecessor blew my mind.\n\nLet's start listing some things. I'll be combining Pros with Cons since some things offset each other.\n+The graphics are BEAUTIFUL. This game running on Cryengine puts its predecessor on the Chrome engine in the dust.\n+The story in this is slow to start going, but once you get into it you just want to keep going. It's very immersive and intriguing and I wish it was longer.\n-The point of 'longer' is true. I beat this game's campaign in 4 hours. Hardly enough time to enjoy everything the game had to offer.\n+But what else did it have to offer? Well the general gameplay mechanics are much better. The mission flow is much smoother. There are much less gameplay bugs to be found in this game. It makes it predecessor look half-♥♥♥♥♥ in comparison.\n-However, the game does suffer from a severe lack of optimizations. For one, the V-Sync does not work. For two, the game suffered so many graphical glitches on DX9 that it was rendered unplayable. DX-11 ran correctly, but not as smoothly. With my beast of a rig I was only able to mantain an average of 50 fps (Meanwhile I can run games like Arma 3 with well over 120 fps). Lastly, I experienced one CTD while playing the second mission of the first act. Not sure if its a common thing or a one-off, but I feel obliged to mention it.\n- The multiplayer is eh. It's just two teams staring at each other across the map, taking shots at each other, while one guy on each team is running around rambo as if this is call of duty, and at least one person is smack-talking every other person in the match. It doesn't do much to extend the life of the game. A co-op mode would have really helped this game.\n\nOverall this game blows its predecessor out of the water. I'll give this an 8/10 for what it is.

I don' t know why. Campaign is nice but a bit too short. Graphics are not bad, but it could be better because game works on cry engine 3. Anyway. I enjoyed campaign and when i passed it i turned on multiplayer.,, It is the worst part of the game. In multiplayer two sniper teams fight from to hills/castles. Time limit is !30! minutes. In my opinion people from CI thought that it will be realistic... But when there are only snipers in the battle? I don't really know. Actually, it's hard to say do I reccomend this game. I click yes, because single player is really nice. If you like having fun in campaign, buy this game and pass campaign on hard or normal (easy will be too easy even for newbies). If you want to "fight in reallistic sniper battles", it' s a waste of time.\n\nPS.I have CD metal case edition i got with 4 multiplayer figures we know from campaign, book "One shot One kill", soundtrack and artbook (book with weapons and figures illustrations).\n\nHope you enjoy my text.

Here is a pro-con list:\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are beautiful\n-The gameplay is definitely unique. It takes patience and planning, but manages to be smooth no matter how many mistakes you make\n-This is probably the only shooter I have ever played that forces you to rely on an A.I. as a teammate, while actually programming it to never get in your way or get you killed.\n\nCons:\n-The voice acting and story-line are BEYOND bad. It's almost as if the devs were trying to make it as cheesy and un-original as possible. Kind of like Bood Dragon, except it's not meant to be a joke.\n-Campaign is extremely short.\n-The player has NO freedom of choice. You won't find a game more linear than this one unless you play a side-scroller. Most of the time it feels as though the game is playing itself, and you're just there to click the mouse button a few times. Even when you are left without your spotter, you are still told who to shoot and when by a voice in your helmet.\n-The multiplayer is a joke. Don't even bother.\n\nConclusion: This game was worth the $4.50 I spent on it while it was on sale, but I wouldn't pay a penny more. The campaign will keep you entertained for about 4 hours until you beat it. After that, just uninstall. It's not worth the hard drive space.","January 4, 2014","false","5.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

Was it for the better or for the worse? Well, let's see it!\n\n---Graphics: This certainly is an improvement! The game looks stunning with the CryEngine. I still think the first episode's graphics were decent but City definitely made a good choice by licensing the 3rd iteration of the CryEngine. Water effects and the jungles / lush forests look simply stunning.\n\n---Campaign: Unfortunately, no changes here. The story is still very, very shallow; sections are quite repetitive and the campaign is overall very short. SMG / rifle sequences are now completely eliminated - this is now good as they were very irritating and made the game very difficult. Finally, emphasis is really on the titular sniper shooting and nothing else! There is now an urban (Sarajevo) and mountain (Tibet) area to make the story more interesting. This is all good but as mentioned the new campaign is also very short. Also, you can easily see how heavily the story mode is scripted: you can only go where the designers intended for you to do so.\n\n---Multiplayer: Very few levels available for you to practice sniping on. Also, I am not a camper so lying on the ground for extremely long minutes to see something happen is not my cup of tea. It is overall very slow-paced; once you have found the best hiding - / vantage points on the levels available there is nothing else to see.\n\nI still do not know where to put Ghost Warrior. The 2nd episode is better but still a very short, mediocre experience for gamers out there regardless of their affection towards sniping. Good sniping can be found in the Sniper Elite franchise which does offer much, much more.","July 20, 2014","false","5.6"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","0"

It's not a AAA Game like Sniper Elite series (The WWII sniper game by Rebellion) but it definitely holds its own. :)\n\nThe sniping? Well, since this is a sniper game? I guess that should be discussed first heh. The game takes into account bullet drop, wind direction, stance, elevation and stamina (how many beats per minute your heart is doing) so the mechanics are all there ok. The bullet cam is very much like Sniper Elite, but no model damage on the enemies. They just flop over. There's also the hold shift to slow down time and make it feel more movie-like and make it easier to hit moving targets. If you sit in sniper/scope mode long enough? The game gives you a little red circle to show where the bullet will hit and highlight when ontop of an enemy... so as a sniper game? It's good... but Sniper Elite feels more rewarding when you land a shot since you see what kind of damage you're doing.\n\nIt has a decent enough storyline... Quite generic tbh but it was good enough for me to want to finish the game.\n\nThe voice acting is also nothing flattering but works good enough to make me want to finish the game.\n\nThe Gameplay? Eh, after playing Sniper Elite and Sniper Elite V2? Gameplay isn't as good as those games. There's no disguises and trying to sneak around... the campaign is extremely scripted where you spend most of it doing exactly what your spotter tells you to do or you die.. speaking of which? Once enemies start hunting for you? The AI will definitely 360 no-scope you at close range. Super annoying when I try to ambush them and as soon as they rush through a doorway? Bullets hit me before their character turns around and I'm dead... so that's seriously annoying lol.\n\nThe graphics? They're pretty darn good, definitely not the best on Cryengine but I'd say a step above State of Decay (another good game built on Cryengine).\n\nThe music? Eh, I think there's only three or four songs for the complete game as most maps feature the same songs... They're ok I guess.\n\nSound effects? Well? Since most of the game you're only using about three different guns (silenced pistol, silenced sniper rifle and a long range silenced sniper rifle) for the whole game? There isn't that much variety in sound effects. The sounds that are there are pretty good though.\n\nMy Steam account says I beat the campaign in 5.2 hours and the asking price is $21.99 CAD... so that equates to $4.22 per hour. I don't plan on playing multiplayer since I'm not much of a multiplayer FPS guy these days I guess. So do I feel like it was worth $4.22 an hour? Kinda I guess. It was fun enough... but there's some older games with a longer campaign for the same asking price that'll give you more entertainment. I'd say get the first Sniper Elite game and see what you think of that game before buying this one tbh. Maybe the same with the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior game.. but of course I don't own that so I can't directly give my opinon on that game, but this one is ok so I'm guessing the first Sniper: Ghost Warrior is also ok.","February 21","true","5.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","1"

This is the 5th one I’ve played and while they are getting better and better slowly, and although I love the idea and the concept, I cannot really “recommend” this game nor can I score it very highly. The game fails to really hook you as an FPS and every level consists of the same repetitive structure, with the story being uninteresting and cliché.

Luckily, out of Expert difficulty, a red dot appears on your crosshairs indicating where the bullet will land. Your best shots can even be seen from a bullet traveling perspective, which makes this quite entertaining.\n\nSadly, there are still many improvements to do.\nStealth is not very reliable, since plants sometimes hide you and sometimes not, like with some hard obstacles. Unless with a teammate AI guiding you, it's often better to eliminate all enemies before crossing the area.\nAI is pretty simplistic, your teammate often not covering you, enemies staying hidden while they can't locate you or run towards you when they spot you, not caring about your allies.\nSome gameplay is pretty frustrating, like not being able to switch between crouch and prone (you must be standing first), nor to switch weapons when aiming down sights. Maps are fairly long and decently detailed, but also show some problems, like some obstacle close just enough to block your way or preventing you from advancing while prone. Including corpses.\nThe story is quite cliché and not detailed. The many cutscenes don't help it and are here mostly trying to give an epic feeling, but pretty much fail to do so. It's also disappointing said cutscenes are pre-rendered videos, at low quality, and sometimes laggy (not joking).\n\nOverall, it's decent game if you want some sniping experience, if you have some time to spare waiting for something else.","January 4, 2014","false","8.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Graphicaly this game looks pretty good, and the positives stop there. This game suffers from MAJOR graphical issues especialy on computers running Directx 9 that really void the aforementioned graphics. The Gameplay effectively boils down to you only being able to follow the instructions of your poorly acted spotter, only kill who he says, only move where he says, when he says. Choose to deviate from his instructions and you will imediately be engaged in a firefight with enemies who will go from not being able to hit a aircraft carrier at point blank to being able to shoot the head off a moving spider. Your spotter is only one of a small number of poorly developed and cringe worthy characters that only make the sub-standard story even less bearable. The overall campaign is EXTREMELY short (Took me around 4 Hours on normal) and has no replay value.\nI initialy thought that this game could be the turning point  for city interactive but had those hopes squashed about 30 mins in.

The 5 hour story is great. It gets a bit repeatitive after first playthrough but the change of difficulty covers that bit. Great sequel to the first game.\n\nWhat bad I have to say about this is the actual shooting. In  hardest difficulty the red reticle is taken away and you have to judge the correct shootingpoint yourself. This, however, is not easy. The red reticle shows where to aim and it takes the wind and distance in account. However when you don't have it, things get tricky. I spent an hour in shooting range trying to figure out the measurements in the scope and they don't make sense. For example: The distance to target is 800 meters and wind is 6 m/s to the left. I aim to point where these conditions are matched perfectly. And when I fire, I miss the target. The bullet goes way over the target and is pointed too much to left. In this case, the correct aiming point was 400 meter distance and 2 m/s wind to left. So the indicators in the scope are for nothing. You just have to guess.\n\nBesides that shooting thing, this is great game. And if you never play with hardest difficulty, you never have to think about that detail.\n\nI still recommend this game. The game is true to its name and is fun to play. But if there was anything else wrong, I wouldn't recommend this.","May 1","true","7.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I had hopes that they would have improved from the first game, I was wrong. I played the game on hard difficulty right off the bat. The game was easy since they held your hand all the way through. So, really there was no tension within the gameplay to keep you on the edge of your seat. Not to mention, the story isn't even worth reading in a book, much less have it play out for you within the game.\n\nBasically, the gameplay consisted of sniping from a fixed position, and then moving on to the next position, then repeat. The most challenging sniping segment comes in the first act of the game, which consisted of 3 acts. The gameplay involved in moving on to the next position is very boring, since again, they hold your hand the entire time. It tries to be a mini game of stealth during these segments but fails miserably. Think of those goofy shooting gallery games at a carnival where you just stand there and try to hit as many targets as possible, combine that with amazing graphics from Cryengine 3, and that's pretty much the game in a nutshell.\n\nIn my opinion, a sniper game needs to be non-linear mostly where tactics play a large role in how well the mission turns out. I have played Sniper Elite (love it), Sniper Elite V2 (could've been 100x better), and Sniper: Ghost Warrior 1. Out of all of them, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 would have to be my least favorite. However, it does have the best eye candy. If this game used the non-linear style of Sniper Elite combined with the Cryengine 3 graphics, it would've been an amazing experience. I did play the DLC Siberian Strike, however, it was only a minimal improvement over the main campaign's gameplay. I didn't even touch the multiplayer, I had no desire to do so. I apologize to the game designers and production team for a bad review, but you deserved it. Games are to be active experiences, they are not to be passive experiences where the option of choice is a minimal factor. Obviously, this game was made just to serve as a way to make some money by cashing in on the masses playing other shooters or possibly to give some new people a chance at making a game with a great engine to design it from. The graphics were upgraded very well compared to the first SGW, but the gameplay was worse than the first in the series.\n\n2 annoying oranges out of 5","February 17, 2014","false","10.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I didn't got that much into the story, but as far as I can tell it's not really interesting either.\n\nThe main reason why I bought this game however was the multiplayer, it looked interesting and I always wanted to try a full on sniper vs sniper team battles taken place in a game actually optimized for sniping and stealth.\n\nYet even the multiplayer is poorly executed. You only have 4 multiplayer maps (without DLC) who all contain glitches. You only have 2 gamemodes: Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. The different sniper rifles don't feel much different from eachother. Sure diferent scope/look/sound but somehow a lot of 'm feel the same. Multiplayer has only 2 zoom toggles. (singleplayer has 3 btw). The multiplayer characters are just characters from the singleplayer but still look poorly, and only 1 of those has the sniper feel ghillie suit on.\nSometimes the server disconnects online and you'll be send back to the main menu or the game will completely crash.\n\nThe graphics are OK, and actually some grass and plants actually move when you touch them which is nice.\nBut the overall feel to the game is just meh.\n\nIf they ever decide to make a Sniper: Ghost warrior 3, I atleast expect:\n- High end graphics\n- Customisable characters and snipers\n- More gamemodes\n- Improved maps and more variety\n- Stable servers\n- An actual interesting story\n\nBut hey, atleast no one is 360 no-scoping in this.

It's very linear story campaign ang gameplay also which either can be good or bad to some.  Not much freedom to rome around. But the DLC campaign is much better than main campaign so if you get this game be sure to get the Siberian Strike DLC.\n\nThe multiplayer can be either fun or frustrating at all. There is a dedicated server, or host your own and server browser too which I seems to always see around averagely 5 or more active games always. So playing with public is guaranteed at this time of writing. Sniping on single player seems pretty straight and simple that you will sure say it's fun snipping but on multiplayer it's all very different 'coz it's frustrating sometimes because everyone hides so well and comes to the point so hard to find your opponents especially the pros. Multiplayer surely needs a lot of patience and passion to play or else frustration will kill you in always getting killed by your opponents. Some get mad and annoyed then go crazy cross over to other other side and just kill them all with handgun.\n\nOverall, It's Average, okay and 65/100 in general view. But might be 85/100 for snipper enthusiast. Buy it on sale to make it worth having.","May 25, 2014","true","23.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you didn’t then there is little here that will likely change your mind.\n\nThe formula is almost the same but the pacing and level design are much improved. In fact, level design, graphic style and the locations for each act are extremely well done. Each has a different atmosphere and feel that helps build tension and excitement. It is a shame that SGW2 is actually so short a game. Given time and resources you can only wonder at just what City Interactive might have achieved.\n\nWhilst there are limited choices in terms of level exploration it is painfully evident you are playing an on rails shooter. You never really shake the corridor shooter feel and the ever present way point indicator only serves as a reminder of just how much you are being funnelled through the game.\n\nThe stealth elements of the game are not infuriatingly complex or overly sensitive to the slightest misstep. However, the few times stealth becomes the play style of choice it is more often than not because it might serve as an easier alternative to simply running in guns blazing. Once again, the lack of a more open world with multiple paths to your objective is more the culprit than the actual mechanics for stealth which are generally pretty good. You just never really have the space to truly explore options to avoid more of the combat.\n\nThe AI is largely there to be killed with minimal fuss and will provide token gestures of resistance whilst being as accommodating as possible to someone armed with a sniper rifle. This is, however, a relative blessing. Were it more proficient in trying to kill you it would only prove just how mind-blowingly useless your spotter is at trying to aid and protect you.\n\nHidden secret items make a return and each act will have a different item to look out for and collect. That said, I’m not at all certain what bonus or benefit you gain from spending time looking for them beyond satisfying any OCD tendencies you might have.\n\nThe single player campaign offers up about 4 hours worth of entertainment so this isn't a game you'll be with for long unless you're planning on spending time with the multiplayer. The multiplayer is entertaining and certainly, so far as I was concerned, offered far more for my money.\n\nWhilst I enjoyed playing through Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 I also felt cheated out of my money. The game is just too short, offers to little in the way of gameplay and left me simultaneously wanting more and glad I gotten it out of the way. Wait for it to appear in a 50% off or better sale before picking up. At full price there are better sniper games and certainly better FPS games available. As a cheap title picked up in a sale to enjoy as a multiplayer game amongst friends between more time consuming or in-depth games, it's a game I'd strongly consider. With the right people SGW2 could potentially be a lot of fun though ultimately it will only ever be a game that you play every now and then.\n","November 1, 2014","true","6.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I enjoyed the first one a lot better than this version.\nEven the Siberian Strike DLC played okay, except for a forced combat section.\n\nIn 18 hours, I played the main game and the DLC. That is kind of disappointing considering the game. I honestly did think that this second game would improve from the first and WANTED it to be more than anything.\n\nThe play seemed clunky in places and at one scripted point, the binoculars were meant to  be in front of me and I was standing up, unable to bring them back up ( I was able to break out of the scripted sequence).\n\nFor the record, I played on medium throughout and just went with the flow of the game. When they hurried, I did. When they relaxed, I did. I did do a lot of stealth knife kills.\n\nOn the plus side, when I hit my marks, they felt satisfying and even nicking them in the side of the neck shows an evil, borderline psychotic love of the animation as they struggle and wriggle at the sudden loss of blood then life.\n\nUnder thermals, the bodies react as expected as they lose life and heat in the DLC. The caves and indoor areas were pitch ♥♥♥♥ing black and rightly so. CryEngine 3 is really good even on sub-gaming rigs (like mine). While the settings weren't ultra hyper real 4k 3d zomg real lifeorz, it was easy to get immersed with the ambient sounds. Physics were almost perfect with some final corpse positions kinda dubious. But then again, my scope wasn't 12x so, couldn't see that far.\n\nI satisfying it a 1572m mark with it, however and the bullet time captured the moment beautifully.\nIt does sound like I'm bashing the ♥♥♥♥ out of it and you could equally argue that I am but I don't feel bitter about it. More wanting, than anything. While adding content for the sake of adding content is in the Gamer's Cardinal Sin book (volume 3), I felt like I wanted to be more snipery (if that makes sense).\n\nTL;DR: A good, solid sniper game with lots of action and beautiful scenery. This would be a solid buy, but replay IMO isn't high - so bear that in mind before you pull the trigger.\n\nOh and two more things: Load last checkpoint is your friend most times and millimetres matter.

The main drawbacks with this game is that it is only 10 hrs long (each level can be completed in about an hour) and if you are spotted at any time in a level it is kind of difficult to get out of as it only takes a couple hits, depending on difficulty, to die. The sniping mechanics are solid as it tries to be as realistic as possible, with the bullet curving to match the wind conditions and angles. It is really fun to line up enemies for a one-shot, double-kill action. The locales in this game are pretty unique for any game, as it features the Phillipines (Russian mercs), Bosnia (Serbian army), and Tibet (Islamic insurgents). The graphics are very detailed using the CryEngine to fully demonstrate its power. Buy this game when it goes on sale, I got it for $5 on a Steam Sale but I would not pay more than $10 for this game as it is very short and the replay value is limited to your inclination of sniping bad guys, but the whole ride is fun while it lasts.","January 1, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

About time I'd say. You are not a lone Rambo-kind-a-guy playing the last man standing in close quarters with a damn sniper rifle. This time around you are actually a support unit, either accompanied with a spotter or directed remotely by the intelligence. Those few occasions in which you are alone always allow you to go ahead at your own pace and pick targets from one of a few safe positions. Sometimes you get to run for your life but that's part of the game (pun not intented).\nIt feels a very well-scripted campaign overall, running a quite smooth operation with proper intelligence, like it was really set up by some agency for you to have all info at your disposal. Small plot twists and various secondary inconveniences just add up to a cool gaming experience.\n\nPS. Don't bother with the first Sniper game, it has a few good sniping sessions, but overall it feels more like a generic B-series FPS with sniper rifles only and small maps.

Art of Victory was a dogs dinner, Ghost Warrior 1 had it's problems that held it back firmly in the realm of average, and this one is just crossing the threshold into "worth your money".  Not full price money mind, but on heavy discount it's worth it.\n\nThey have thankfully gotten rid of the terrible non-sniping parts of GW1 (you can't even use an assault rifle in this game) and this is a purely snipe oriented game - as it should be.  There have been improvements to the AI and there is now an indicator for when you are alerting enemies.  The gameplay is purely linear, there are no options to go off the beaten path, and some sections fell very hand-holdy with your spotter telling you exactly what to do and when when it is painfully obvious what you ned to do anyway.  Enemies are fairly ruthless if you let them get anywhere near you, and avoiding alerts is certainly the way the game is meant to be played.\n\nThere are a few annoyances, the cutscenes are in a really crappy resolution and don't look good, stealth killing enemies with your knife can leave you unable to move as if stuck due to a clipping issue for a few seconds, and there are a few points where dialogue will be delivered twice, or too early for the set piece it's attributed to.  The game also remains a short one, shorter than GW1 clocking in at around 4-4.5 hours.  The story is of course nonsense as well.\n\nIf CI Games continues to improve, who knows, maybe a GW3 will actually make the cut at above heavy discount prices.","March 21","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, stuff like the physics of snipering seems to be rather realistic as well (wind etc.). However, I was kinda disappointed at the tactical side of things. Maybe it was stupid to buy the game spontaneously during a sale (9 bucks), but I was hoping for a bit more tactic... getting a mission, then planning how to solve it, etc.\n\nInstead, you are accompanied by a spotter who guides you through the missions, rushing ahead, telling you where to go, whom to shoot how etc. At first, I thought this was just the tutorial, but it kept going like that, and based on some other reviews I read, most of the game is like that.\nWhile there is a certain realism to that (going in with a spotter), it's kind of annoying. You feel totally rushed, and you hardly make ANY decision or plan by yourself. The spotter rushes ahead (and sometimes, especially at the beginning, it sometimes even was confusing as you had to remember the controls and follow him quickly, using the same moves he did), and talks you through every mission like that. It's a bit like some dude who has solved the game already, sitting next to you while you play, constantly telling you "Dude, go there, now shoot this guy, then that one, then lets go on".\n\nI realize that maybe, the first part of the game was like that too. I dont know, I didnt play that. I just saw this and thought "Hey cool, a sniper-game, where it's not like in many ego-shooters, zerging through, killing tons of mobs as quickly as possible, but a bit more relaxed and tactical". Unfortunately, I was totally wrong, and while the graphics are nice and shooting at range is fun, the spotter-thing is more than annoying at least to me.","January 5, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The shooting range is in of itself a single map that one selects a gun (and can swap them out) and then gets in position and snipes the actual targets... they are not cardboard cutout but actual 3d characters that are mobile. Wind is a factor in the game as is distance (gravity).\n\nThe campain for this game feels rushed. The gemetry/maps are built well (only had one instance that what diisplayed and what was got me... which was nice (every game has at least one if you explore as I do). The thing that makes it feel rushed is that there are many isntances where it says shoot X and I have no idea where X is, and they jsut keep repeating shoot X... which is especially difficult to look for when you are being shot at. Sometimes they effectively say what to target and where, most of the time they do not, however sometimes they are marked for you... Finally there is one instance where you have less than a second or 2 to snipe a very mobile target that if you don't hit you must retry it again, and again, and again... by the time I got it I think I quick scoped without any expectation of hitting the danged target... and in no way could effectively repeat the success.\n\nIt is not a bad campain or game, just can just lack its entertainment value at times.\nIf you can get this game for real cheap then go for it, otherwise I would not go out of your way for it. Cheap for me would be a buck or two... or grab it in a bundle of some sort if that is more economical for oneself.","May 30, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What were they thinking?! Let's talk about the story first - one word: Lame. It was so short and there was no obvious point to everything you were doing. It was so hard to follow. Oh, and just so you know, I review a game on it's gameplay, not on its graphical quality, although, I gotta say, the graphics were absolutely outstanding! However, that was really the only good thing about the game. The feel of the game with the sniper rifle and running around felt very clunky, even for a PC game - and where I would get around 60 - 80 FPS on high settings, I would still get this really irritating stutter glitch/bug (Had an FPS counter in top left corner of screen).\n\nThere was no sence of freedom to make your own decisions about infiltrating this place or killing these people. It was far too easy because you had that really annoying spotter sitting next to you the whole time telling you how to do it. No thinking is required. Also, it is without a shadow of a doubt THE MOST LINEAR GAME IN THE HISTORY OF GAMES. No exaggeration. You couldn't make the decision to go left or right to get to your location, no open-world aspects, all you could do was follow your spotter. I felt like a baby learning how to walk whilst playing this game. I could often guess what was going to happen next half the time. WHERE IS THE FUN IN ANY OF THAT?!\n\nThe story all felt very cliché and hollywood movie esque. By that I mean it had three very American protagonists, played by, what sounded to be, low budget - somewhat amatuer voice actors.\n\nAnd so on, blah blah blah. You could finish they campaign in just under 4 hours if you rushed it, which to be honest, I did because it was so boring I just wanted to get it over with.\n\n-MULTIPLAYER-\nThe multiplayer for Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 was all round extremely dull. There was nothing good to say about it to be honest. It's what you would expect from a sniper-based game: lots of camping, spending an age to find a target to shoot at, and when you eventually do find a target, they either move before you can get a shot, or you are shot first.\n\n-OVERALL VERDICT-\n\nPros\n-Stunning Graphics\n-(Reasonably) Clever AI\n\nCons\n-Short Story\n-Boring Story\n-Cliché Story\n-Same-old Story\n-Clunky feel when playing\n-Repetetive\n-Dull Multiplayer (full of little kids squealing on the mic)\n-NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE FIRST GAME\n\n-ADVICE-\nDon't buy this game - spend your money on a better game, for example: The first one!\n\nThanks for reading.","February 18, 2014","false","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For instance, you take down the enemies that are not in line of sight of each other to remain hidden. If you are spotted you are in trouble and things become a lot more difficult, but you do not automatically fail. You can also choose to sneak around enemies and leave them alive, or take them out from close quarters.\n\nThis game is absorbing and highly entertaining. Don't expect a story like Call of Duty, or an insane graphical masterpiece.\n\nWant a true challenge? Harder difficulties remove the aim dot. You need to check the wind strength and range, and then align your shot accordingly. This game mode immerses you even more.\n\nThe serbian strike DLC was great, but shorter than the main campain (as expected).\n\nI have not played much of the multiplayer yet. There are a couple of servers that are active. Proper sniper battles.\n\nI will buy the sequel, if there ever is one.","December 13, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I recommend get this game when it is 75% off. I just finished the single mission in normal difficulty. It's a pretty easy and casual game at least for me in this difficulty. So i think most of the people can handle this game and get started easily. The single mission is pretty short, there are three  acts. Each acts contains three parts. In total, there are nine parts. For me, each part cost me around 15-20 minutes to finish. That is to say, 3-4 hours will be enough for most new players to finish the single mission. The disappointing thing is that when i try to play multi player mode, the game just kept saying that U lost the connection. That really frustrated me. After trying three times, i deleted this game from my Pc.\nOverall, still a fine game to buy if it is on discount. The single mission is interesting and the scenery in the mission looks pretty cool so i got several screenshots. BTW, there are some glitches in this game, if you meet some of them, just restart the game or relaod the checkpoint, it will be ok.

There were only two things that really irritated me about the game; one being that sometimes the matchmaking either didn't work or was dead, even though it was an active part of the day, and what annoyed me the most was the poorly designed hitboxes that activate cutscenes. This hitbox issue even occured on the final kill of the game that is the most 'climactic' kill of the entire game, even I could see that my bullet missed yet the cutscene still went on to where the target died. Whilst multiplayer matches were sometimes difficult to find, once gameplay inside of them initiated, I always found it very unique as the game, at first look, has a very similar genre to the Call of Duty series, yet the multiplayer is so different from any other game I've ever played...it's snipers only. So yeah sure, it is basically 'Campers v Campers' but it still works without being majorly irritating, even though some people are CRAZY good at it.\n\nTLDR: The game can of course go with having some work done on it, but for a quick and unique game to play, it was definitely worth my $3 and could be worth your $20 if you don't like saving money, although I personaly wouldn't have paid $20 myself because I do like saving.","December 6, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Works good thanks cry-engine 3\n\nSound - 7/10\nSound is very nice. specially the gun sound - surround. only 7/10 because the sound sometimes\ncrashes and you have to restart the game to get sounds and noises back (reported by several gamers).\n\nAI - 7/10\nThe single-player AI ist also well done. Some very rare bugs / senceless movements but overall good made.\n\nIngame enviroment possibilities - 6/10\nThe enviroment is seems nearly most of the time just basicly done. there is no additional door to open or another path to go. no other guns or equipement to pick up. sad.\n\ncomplexity - 9/10\nThe game is easy to understand and after you made a few training shots in the training mode (takes really just few minutes) you are ready for the game.\n\nSingle Player - 7/10\nThe storyline is okay. nothing with a real "wow" effect but also not boring.\n\nMultiplayer 4/10\nWell the multiplayer is really something that could have done better. First: LAN doesnt work. So no matches via LAN or Tunngle-LAN.\nThen there are some cheaters/wallhackers. not too many, but you will find some on the servers. the possibility to kick them from the server is weak: you can only kick them in the end of the round (for 5 seconds), and even this possibility took months until the developers involved it after huge (!) complaints in the forums.\n\nThe normal internet connection game works very well and you will still find always few people online\n\n- dont be confused if you dont see servers or see very less servers online. The reason is: Full servers are NOT shown in the server list, because you cant join them anyway -\nLast: there are much too less maps. basicly there were 3, then there came 2 more and with the dlc another 3-4 more. but after short time, you find out that less than 10 maps is really a weak service.\n\nThe rest of the MP works great. Also weapons with different characteristics (look up my guide in the SGW2 Forum) and sounds are nice.\n\nPrice 3/10\nPrice is definetly much to high. I wouldnt pay 40 EUR again for this. The game is not that "cheap", but 20 EUR for this, including all dlc's would be a good deal.","January 19, 2015","true","294.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonex90/recommended/34870/","jonex90","J o n e x","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonex90/","977 products in account","Before starting to play Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, my expectations were very high. I was expecting it to at least match the original game in terms of gameplay features. Unfortunately it failed to do this, and ultimately failed to meet the standards of the Cry Engine 3 (one of the most powerful engines currently available).\n\nSimilar to the way I felt before and after I started playing the game, I’ll start with the good things and move on to the bad things and finish with the best part.\n\nSniper Ghost Warrior 2 does the sniping aspect very well.  There aren’t too many FPS games out there that focus on sniping, or at least, there aren’t any out there that have this much depth to sniping. The developers have done a superb job at creating a realistic sniping experience. Various measurements need to be taken before lining up the perfect shot and different locations mean different adjustments. Distance, wind, and even the curve of the bullet need to be taken into consideration. This makes sniping enemies very enjoyable and varied, depending on conditions.\n\nThe developer, City Interactive seemed to have focused perhaps too much on the sniping aspects of the game, because that’s about all that’s good about it :/ I’ve noticed a lack of gameplay features that were present in the previous game such as, grapple hooking your way to high places, picking up enemy firearms, using throwing knives to take out enemies. The gameplay revolves completely around using your sniper rifle to well……..snipe, and using your P220 pistol if things get up close and personal. The P220 features in all three of the chapters as a sidearm, but the primary sniper rifle changes depending on what chapter you’re playing. Apart from finding the occasional enemy Dragunov rifle, you have no other weapons to find or interact with.  This seriously upset me.\n\nLevel design is another issue with Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. The levels are detailed, but I feel this is just a way of disguising how painstakingly linear they are. Each chapter has you following a set path with a few open vistas to shoot enemies from a far. The vistas do offer fairly detailed locations to find and shoot enemies, but ultimately they just serve as complex shooting galleries and you never actually get to explore them. The levels are also too small. I find myself disappointed whenever I round a corner, only to realise that I’m in an even smaller house than the last one I was in. I was really hoping for a more open ended level design, but City Interactive has decided to play it safe and keep things way too simple.\n\nLastly, I’ll talk about the multiplayer. This is the most surprising part about Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. It’s actually a decent addition to the game. I was highly expecting an equally lack luster experience online as I did with my campaign experience, but it turned out better than expected. Sniping is really the only feature in multiplayer, but it’s easier to enjoy due to the lack of a forced story or other cheesy scripted events. The multiplayer levels are really well designed, plenty of places to hide, plenty of choices for rifles to use, and plenty of intensity that should have been more common in the single player. Looking around the maps for enemies is a long and tiring process, but once you find one and line up the perfect shot, it’s all worth it. Hearing the bullet whizz past your head as another sniper takes shots at you, forcing you to relocate before it’s too late, that’s an awesome feeling too. It’s a nice break from the normal run and gun shooters out there, where the SMG class is king. In this case, less is more.\n\nOverall I did enjoy Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. While it didn’t meet my expectations, it still does sniping better than any other game I’ve played. I can see myself continuing to play the multiplayer, while waiting for the DirectX 11 patch to be released. I might get 10 more hours out of it if I’m lucky. If you’re a sucker for FPS games like me, this will be worth your time. If not, then you won’t be missing much.\n\n6/10","April 4, 2013","true","31.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/34870/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","One thing is certain: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is certainly more enjoyable than its predecessor. But is it that much better if you look closer ? No, but there are a few things that have been improved.\nFirst of all, the game now runs on the CryEngine 3. It's definitely visible as the game looks more vibrant and detailed, but faces are still a bit low poly. And the environments, while they look frequently beautiful, are still not open. The game lets you walk in only one direction, so, like the first one, it's still linear. Not a big deal at all, but it would've been cooler if you had the chance to kill people from more than one location.\n\nAnother improvement is that it's more stealthy. In the first one there were a few moments where you had to kill (waves of) enemies using regular weapons, which was a bit odd considering the fact that it's a sniper game and it's called Sniper Ghost Warrior. SGW2 fixes that problem. You still get to switch to your handgun, but there are no other weapons besides that one and your trusty sniper rifle. Firefights are more intense because of that. Now, intense might not be the right word for it, because they aren't really, but you get the feeling you're playing as a real sniper. And while kills aren't as satisfying as sniping someone in Sniper Elite V2 it still does a good job of mixing up the action with some slow motion bullet kills. Even if they're not that spectacular.\n\nThe game consists of three acts, with several missions in each act. Missions will take somewhere between 10-30 minutes, and most of us will finish the game within 5,5 hours. It's not overly long and therefore stays enjoyable all the way through.\n\nIf you're into sniper games, like me, SGW2 might be worth your time and money. It all depends on how much of a fan you are. Still, if I had to choose between this game and Sniper Elite V2, Sniper Elite would win without a doubt. That doesn't mean it's bad, but it does mean there's still room for improvement.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","March 18, 2013","true","5.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The singleplayer campaign is really unpolished, but there are some parts where it gives you a bit of freedom and these are often quite enjoyable. The game is also reasonably comitted to the sniper angle, and does it fairly well. You only ever get a sniper rifle and pistol, so you have to be stealthy. Occasionally, you actually have to think about the best way to accomplish that, and these sections are generally pretty good and evoke the patience and planning of a skilled sniper. At other times the game forces you into gunfights, and these suck. Enemies can kill you very easily, which is good for a stealth game but frustrating in an action game in which you have very little short-to-medium range firepower, since your pistol is crap and your rifle is always scoped and bolt-action. Still, a cautious and skillful player can avoid the great majority of these, so it's not a huge problem.\n\nAbout the plot, not much can be said. Dull military bros shoot a bunch of dudes, and somebody's evil, and more dudes are shot. One level is set in Bosnia, which is pretty cool. I have no idea how historically accurate it is but it's nice to see some new settings being explored.\n\nThe game looks okay. It's got some nice CryEngine-y effects, but a lot of the assets are kinda fugly. Ultimately it gets the job done. Some of the level design is well-done, but checkpoint spacing is often poor, and manual saves are not allowed. Bugs crop up from time to time, everything from bullets passing harmlessly through enemies to your companion's AI simply not triggering, but it's not completely game-ruining.\n\nUltimately this is only for people who really like single-player shooters. It lacks the polish and bombast of stuff like Call of Duty, but it also lacks the flexibility and openness of games like Crysis or Far Cry 3. Still, for a budget developer it's a pretty solid release, and bodes well for a third game. I wouldn't recommend it at $20, as it's just not polished enough, but for $10 or less it's worth a shot.","June 11, 2014","true","23.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let me explain: this game does look a lot better than its predecessor and that's thanks to Cryengine 3. That being said, most other aspects of this game are average at best. Voice acting is okay...nothing spectacular and the same goes for AI. The story is not really engaging and there is virtually no character development.\n\nNow for the part you're waiting to hear about: the sniping. Few games capture the true feel of sniping (here I'm speculating, having never been a sniper or anything of the sort) as this game does. When you approach a combat situatuon there are several things you must consider: 1.) Your surroundings. Are you exposed or hidden? Do you have a good grasp of the area or are you working on limited information? 2.) Your heartbeat. This effects your shots. To be the most accurate, you must wait for your heartbeat to lower or you will have major bobbing of the scope. 3.) Distance and wind direction. On the lower difficulties, the game will assist you with this aspect. I play on the hardest, this means no assist. You must assess the range and power of the wind and take your shot accordingly. This is where the game shines in my opinion.\n\nOf course, you can just shoot without taking these things into consideration but this retracts from the game I think. Sniper: Ghost Warrior wants you to think like a sniper and if you do, you will be rewarded with the satisfaction of making that perfect shot.","July 18, 2013","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This game is AMAZING. It's a bit older and so the CPU can react a bit odd, and have super aim (it seems) but it doesn't spoil the game. I see that alot of people had issues with the specs, and it's probbably because the graphics KICK ♥♥♥. I had to run them on low at times, and they still looked...dare I say it... MAGESTIC. This would bring up issues with laptops or any desktop that doesn't have a special graphics card because even in the lowest setting it has a pretty high standard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtGiggsy/recommended/34870/","sgtGiggsy","sgtGiggsy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtGiggsy/","34 products in account","It's a rather controversial game. In my opinion, it's far better, than its only rival, the SniperElite v2, but it doesn't make it good. The graphics are okay, the story is ridiculously simple (and bad), but the athmosphere of the game is more or less good.\nThe creators learned from their earlier mistakes. Not learned enough, but learned. The game finally more good than bad, and I find this improvement promising. Finally enemies can't see you from 200 meters while you crawl under a bush, and most of the times they act like a human being... No, that was a little strong word for it, so let's just say they smarter than the CoD enemies.\nAnd why it isn't an especially good game? First of all, sometimes it's anoying as hell. There are many times, where the save point is before some unskippable scripted event, and we have to watch it over and over again if we couldn't be succeded at the first time. And there are situations where we have to try a section for a several times, because it's literally almost impossible to find who do we need to shot. The levels are bigger, than they were in the first game, yet they still too linear, and too much part of the game we have to follow our spotter, who (by the way) doesn't worth anything when it comes to fight. If there are two enemies, he helps us to kill one of them, but other than that, he almost never shoot, and doesn't even cover our back. Luckily the enemies see that he's such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so they don't shoot at him, even if he runs past them. And the last problem is that the game is rather frustrating sometimes. The best example for it is the final "bossfight" if we can call that this way. We have to fight with our nemesis, a traitor, an other US sniper, which is literally means the following: we are proning at a lookout, and searching the area to find him. That's all. Sometimes he shoots at us, so we have about 30-45 seconds to find him, before we die. The tricky part is, the area is FRAKIN' huge (imagine an area which is about 250-270 degrees wide, and there are buildings between 300 to 1100 meters), and the boss shows himself only when he shoots. Of course we can't move to an other spot where he don't know exactly where we are. The game doesn't even let us to let go the riffle and take a look without the scope to see the glimpse of sunlight of the enemy's scope. So the final bossfight is only about luck. If you don't watch exactly the same spot, exactly the same time when the boss shoots at you, you won't find him. If you are lucky, you find him at the first occasion, if you are not, you'll try a hundred times, and you still won't see him.\nThey put multiplayer in the game, because nowdays even a frakin' SIMulator of a CITY can't live without multiplayer, so how an FPS could be? It was just a waste of the precious worktime, because doesn't worth a damn. Snipers against snipers, so it's boring-boring-boring. A co-operative multiplayer might work, but the competitive one isn't a good choice for this game. You literally watch the area, looking for enemy snipers, and you are happy when... no, not when you kill someone, you are happy even when you finally see a player from the enemy team.\nSince there aren't many competitors for SGW2, I recommend it but not for everybody. If you are a usual FPS player, then you won't like it. It's for sniper fanatics only, and even they won't be satisfied with it, but as I said: there aren't many games with this theme :/","April 25, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nothing beats these mechanics. I'm a LEM in Matchmaking for CSGO, and was once in high-ish rankings in TAM ladders for ut2k4. I've played a crap ton of SP and MP games from BF3, back to UT99.  I got this game in a bundle, and didn't expect to actually play it. I was quite surprised. It's very linear and the story is meh. The gameplay otherwise is quite awesome,\n\nThe shooting mechanics (physics) are pretty awesome though. I recommend the game solely on that. Everything matters from heart rate, to holding a breath, to when's the last time you held your breath, to distance from target, gravity.. caliber of bullet.. It just takes so much patience and understanding.\n\nI played it one time through campaign on the hardest difficulty, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was a very nice change of pace from the other shooter games I've ever played. A little slow and the linear aspect was not fantastic, but I hear the next iteration in their series is supposed to be open world, so definitely count me in for that.\n\nWould recommend to friends.","December 28, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is the first game I picked.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, I played on Normal difficulty and found it a bit too easy and forgiving, will probably restart it on hard at some pont in the future.  As is common with many single player campaigns I felt the game was too short overall, I think it took me around 3 hours to complete.  The story however was compelling, and I liked the one shot one kill sniper style of play, versus the normal pray and spray, shoot everything that moves, and then shoot the stuff that doesnt move fps style of game.\n\nMy one and only complaint (SPOILER) when you shoot ♥♥♥♥♥♥, they took the time to make the animation for shooting through his scope, but his eye stays intact through the entire thing.  Last I checked a .50 cal round through a scope and into your head, takes your eye with it.  But I suppose since this is what I decided to fault the game over, that overall the devs did an outstanding job with this game.\n\n8/10  Worth the money.\n\n","March 4","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can really feel here as a sniper wandering in the darkness, hunting its targets alone or with observer who navigates you and tags enemies in order of efficiency. The plot was fine for me (although it could have been longer); it had plot twists or stories that quite intriguied me and fitted to beautiful locations mentioned by me earlier.\nSniper: Ghost Warrior 2 of course has some cons, like minor technical or graphical bugs, but they definitely don't make the experience you get any lower. It'd be awesome if our hero could pick up some carabines or different pistols, because there is not huge choice among pistols or not-sniper rifle weapons.\nIn conclusion, I recommend Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2.

Defenitely better real 'sniping' experience than for example Sniper Elite. It tries to be somewhat of a sniper simulator but can't really deliver there like ARMA does. However in the context of this game it is enough to make gameplay very interesting and even challenging.\n-Pretty decent graphics and nice environments.\n-Story not very good but interesting enough.\n\n\nCon's\n-Badly optimised. Although my computer is absolutely fine (can run all games i know at high/very high) this game did not feel fluid. Especially when running it felt weird, a kind of stuttering or something.\n-Bugs. This game has its share of bugs. Usually nothing game-breaking but i once could not pick up my gun and the keys to change stance seem to randomly make you crouch, stand or go prone which is very annoying.\n-VERY VERY Linear. you don't have any choice to do anything. You can complete the objective in one way and no other.\n-Voice acting is a little dull sometimes\n-That red dot. The only thing making this game a challenge is aiming. With the red dot enabled (when looking through your scope it gives the exact place you are going to hit) there is absolutely no challenge. There really should be a way of disabling it without having to play on the hardest difficulty. The same goes for the hints and everything.\n-Companion AI is bad. When following a companion they always run. I could barely catch up with them and usually i just played my own style and they would just stand and wait out in the open until i catched up.\n\nConclusion\nIt is a decent game for a few hours of fun. It gives a pretty good sniping experience where your skill will matter (if you play on hard so disable aim assist). It defenitely immerses you in the role of a sniper. Get it when it is in the sale and you will not regret your purchase","February 13","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can't comment on whether the inital reviews were justified or the extent of any bugs which were subsequently fixed.  What I can say is that this is not a bad game.  I've played through the single-player campaign (about 7 hours) and the Siberian Strike DLC (about 2.5 hours) and had a fair amount of fun doing it.\n\nOverall, I thought it offered a nice, if over the top, narrative and reasonable stealth / sniper mechanics.  Much of the criticism of the game centers on its linear nature.  On that count, it's guilty as charged.  You will never confuse this game with Far Cry 3 in terms of open world mechanics.  That said, there are plenty of games that offer a fun experience in a linear fashion.  While the encounters are essentially all set-piece they are nicely designed.  I'm still not sure what the campaign was doing in Tibet, but it was terrifically rendered.\n\nI'd define the highs and lows as follows:\n\nHighs:\nSolid graphics (better than average PC options for a port)\nGood sniper gameplay\nReasonable level of player decisioning (no penalties if you decide to alert the enemy rather than being stealthy)\nLogical controls\nGood range of difficulty levels\nEssentially bug-free as far as I could tell\n\nLows:\nA little short\nA wonky checkpoint or two (nothing game breaking)\nOccasional unaware enemies (walking past bodies with no reaction)\n\nOverall, I had a good time playing through the campaign and DLC and will probably do so again.  If you are looking for a sniper game specifically, I would probably recommended Sniper Elite: V2 over this one but only by a small margin.  If you catch this one on a periodic Steam sale for less than $10, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up along with the Siberian Strike DLC.\n\n","December 7, 2013","true","29.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Selected medium difficulty and game is very, very heavily scripted. By "scripted" I mean the game tells you where to look, what to shoot at. It even goes up to locking your view so you cannot stray aside too much when aiming or using binnoculars. I hope on maximum difficulty this is not present, because it's so scripted it's starting to disgust me. Graphics are okay, since it's Crytech engine. Tried on both an old and more powerful PC, and it works nicely on the old PC. Voice acting is good, sniper support role is not bad, but the amount of scripting and linear action is very heavy. Unless MP is good, I dont really see much replayability on this game.\n\nIf you come from harder sniper games like the Sniper Elites series, this games adds a more modern view of sniping but you _must_ play on hardest difficulty level. Otherwise, it feels way too scripted, with almost no choice of targets and how you approach them. On maximum difficulty level, it's ok.","November 15, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It feels pretty good to line up a shot with a decent range and some wind and just place a bullet in centermass.\n\nHowever, the game is quite buggy and the checkpoints are odd and inconsistent.\nIn one of the earlier missions you are placed in a high advantage point with a very high powered sniper's rifle like a .50 cal or something. Not only do people not hear the shots even though it is only 300 meters away, but I was actually placed slightly below the surface on which I was supposed to lie on.\n\nThe stealth is weird and inconsistent sometimes you can just hide in some slightly shadowy area and you are completely invisible to the enemy whereas other times they can see through planks and bushes. It may have something to do with playing on the hardest difficulty I am not entirely sure.\n\nThe point that made me uninstall the game, was when I was supposed to shoot a pilot (inside a helicopter) from a decent  range and good amount of wind, but I only had like 4 seconds to do so giving me time for like 2 or 3 shots. I failed and had to do a bunch of stuff again, failed again and now the checkpoint was right next to the pilot-sniping, however I had no weapon so I couldn't even try it.","May 1","false","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is holding your hand the entire trip. They say its a tactical shooter but there is no tactics involved because there is only one way you can confront the enemies. Its also very scripted, the enemies have no free will unless you raise their awareness.\nFor a cryengine game the graphics is terrible. Its even worse than Ghost Warrior 1. You cant pick weapons or play around with them before entering a mission which is a shame, they didnt improve from Ghost Warrior 1 at all. Its very boring because there are only a fiew good sniping opportunities in the game, the rest is bushsneaking in tight corridors. The autosave system is bad too. If you die, (you will die fast) you have to do the same boring, scripted scenario again which will involve waiting, waiting and more waiting.","May 13","false","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It has a good mix of sneaking and shooting, and the levels where you don't have a spotter are suitably challenging. Playing it on anything less than Expert is a waste, since the bullet impact indicator makes long range sniping far too easy. Pulling off a 1,400 metre headshot on Expert mode is, however, suitably satisfying.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely astounding. The third mission arc is set in a Nepalese monastery, and the scenery looks straight out of a travel book. That said, I'd not expect anything short of gorgeous on the Crysis 2 engine.","October 24, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

He always goes afk and stops responding to anything. Even when there is enemy directly shooting at both of us he just doesnt care and not do anything. This needs to be fixed since there are multiple parts of the game where you need your spotter's help to go through the mission. This game breaking bug is extremely annoying and its found in multiple parts of the first mission - after he says "lets wait it out" nothing happens for 3 minutes straight until you manually draw the enemy's attension.

I like games that you can do whatever you want and find secrets in one area then go to the next and fight enemies in a number of different ways. Instead, this game puts you on a rail where it's like "Kill all these guys" then "Sneak pass these guys" and I really get bored of it that quick.\n\nThe graphics look amazing on the highest settings, but this fact does not make the game better, the gameplay does. If you had a game that could only run on advanced computers, but it the game is terrible, then no one will play it because it's just all effort was put into graphics.\n\nThe multiplayer is horrible. Just dreadful. You can't kick/ban people in-game, you have to wait until the lobby to do it, and even if you do that, the people can come back as a different name and keep doing stuff. There are also instances where you are not visible to anyone and still be shot from no where. This game needs VAC on every server, or something even better than VAC and kick/ban abilities during game.\n\nThe DLCs are redeem this game a little, but not much too pull it out of the toliet where it belongs.\n\nOver all, if they focused more on story/gameplay, it would be more decent. I would give this game a 4/10.\n\n\n","August 12, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Compensate with the adjustable sights."\nIf the game would have done away with the red circle and instead would have let me adjust for bullet drop and wind drift by hand via those two screws right and on top of the scope, that would have added a whole aditional layer of depth to the game play mechanik. But no.\nIf the game at least had a descent tutorial where a drill instructor talks you through the basics of shooting, that would have been great. Even if mostly for atmosphere.\n\nTerminal ballistics too seem to have ben programed by someone who never saw a rifle up close.\nA 7.62 NATO round can go through two bodys and retain enough power to take out a third? And keeps flying in a perfectly straight line after the second body? Riiiiiight...\nBut at the same time it wont go through a single layer of brick...\n\nControlls are in general functional, but as mentioned above, tempramental.\nThere is for example a button for going prone, but when you are croutching, it doesn't work. You have to hit it, then hit the button you normaly use for switching between crutching and standing to lay down. And sometimes even that doesn't work and instead of htting the dirt to avoyd bullets or detection, your character stands up.\nBecause reasons...\n\n\nDo I recomend this game?\nWell, if you are desperate to kill 5 to 6 hours and have 20 bucks you don't know what else to do with, then go for it.\nOtherwise, no.","September 1, 2015","false","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The game literally crashed my computer during one of the cutscenes. My pc can max this game without breaking a sweat, and this wasn't a crash to desktop, the computer completely turned off. When I powered back up my save file was corrupt. This is why I haven't even finished the single player yet, even though it is so short.\n\nWas I devasted? Not really, multiplayer was unaffected in any way. The multiplayer experience in Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is an enjoyable one, if you enjoy sniping. Matches are around 20 minutes long and often never score higher than 15 or so kills. The sniping mechanics are really great in this game.\n\nPros\n+Good mechanics\n+AR/SMG sections of first game are gone\n+Multiplayer is fun\n+Environments are very nice looking\n\nCons\n-Poor story\n-Very buggy\n-Lack of a multiplayer community, theres hardly ever more than one server\n-Crashes for unknown reasons\n-Character models look horrendous\n\nAs I bought this game for the multiplayer, I would reccomend the multiplayer portion to a friend. As far as the single player experience goes, try out any of the Sniper Elite titles.","January 8, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And even on the p.o.s. laptop, textures where showing and now, with a very modern gaming pc, this type of performence is unacceptable (And before anyone asks, The graphic card I own was type of the Line beating out Nividia [yes, AMD DID have a card that won that year; so shut up on the debate cause it makes both you and the person you're talking to about said debate look like ♥♥♥♥ing idiots and no girl or guy would date you cause of it!).\n\n\n\nTL:DR: Until bugs are fixed in game, avoid it at a cost, or pick it up on a sale.","March 23","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean, I know the game is trying to look nice for a non-triple A game, but come on. Also, the friendly AI (Atleast from the starting mission) moves painfully slow and stops every 3 seconds if you are walking, making for a really boring combo. The enemy AI is no better, they look around the general area you are coincidentally and some how make out (Even though you are wearing a stealth outfit in folliage) where EXACTLY you are. I played this game for the first hour and got extremely tired of it due to these reasons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRHELPER/recommended/34870/","DRHELPER","Mr. Pancakez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRHELPER/","96 products in account","Worst fricking game of all time, DO NOT BUY, SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY and IGNORE. It has terrible performance, and a cruddy multiplayer. Can't even switch your pistol for an assault rifle, just in case! Also, the guy must wear like a frickin t-shirt because you die in like 1 hit, even on full health. The companion's AI is terrible, they do literally nothing for the player, or the game. The most common companion I've seen is Diaz and he gets an assault rifle, but goes for the least threatening guy when your cought. Checkpoints are few and far between at points where they are the most necessary, but every other hallway you encounter in the least necessary situations. You will find that even though your guy is a sniper and must have a strong arm, you cannot hold your rifle still even while crouching, which is when you are generally using it, and going prone generally leads to a tiny ledge in the way from bad level design, so you have to crouch and end up missing. I found myself often missing an easy target because a wooden plank is preventing me from going prone to be steadier. The graphics are acceptible, and in fact probably better than Call of Duty, and it has an interesting story, with a great sense of actually sniping, except for the stability. The best part is how your bullet drops with distance and is very affected by the wind, though I wish the little circle showing where the bullet will land would always be visible, as I often find myself looking around a target trying to find the dot. I've had frequent crashes, once caausing my entire computer to crash, so that is upsetting. Then after restarting your computer / the game, you need to sit through 4 different company thingies that you get at the beginning of most games that tell you who sponsored / help made the game and what engine it runs which are all unskippable. If they were skippable or only one or two, it would be OK, but there's four. FOUR! Thats over 20 seconds just waiting to get to the main menu!!! UNACCEPTABLE! So, to recap, I buy a game, have it not work, and have a serious game breaking graphical bug that gets fixed (without changing a thing) a few days later, only to have it crash, then sit through the company ad things all over again. I bought this game in the Bundle Stars Sniper Ghost Warrior Pack for $2.99, and now I know why it was priced that way. I can't believe they make you pay extra for DLC for one of the worst multiplayers ever!! 2 out of 10 stars.","December 18, 2015","false","10.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Scripted? Looks awful? Well, those things too, but the worst thing is YOU CAN'T QUICKSCOPE!YOU CAN'T SNIPE PEOPLE! Most of this game is stealth. STEALTH IN A SNIPER GAME! WHY? WHYYYYYYY?\nNot only that, it's like a rail shooter with only some freedom. It's short and it's...well, awful looking. And here's the kicker: IT WAS MADE IN CRYENGINE. Yes, the same engine running Crysis and Far Cry is looking awful down here.\nThe AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm not goin' to lie, it's total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The only way to get detected is either fire a round or walk straight into one and wait 3 seconds.\nAlso: Dev claims in a nutshell!\n"Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform, first-person, modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience."\nWhat about Sniper Elite V2? I mean it was multi-platform, and it's much better than this.\n"It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges;"\nLike what? I just sat for 3 minutes waiting for an enemy to come from behind a wall.\n"a rebuilt AI system"\nYeah right.\n"the thrilling “one shot, one kill” precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide."\nI just put the marker showing up on an enemy's head and BOOM! so much precision\n"Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments."\nThat's the best joke i've heard in YEARS. (not cryengine, advanced graphics)\n"Motion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad’s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence."\nHah. I'll "jerk" the trigger alright.\n"Realistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics. Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot."\n...Unless you use your scope, where we highlighted that sweet spot.\n"Refined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal “one shot; one kill.”\nHow do they? I just run up and wait for 10 seconds.\n"Improved Enemy AI: (i'll skip this part, it's useless)"\nMmmkay then. Improved AI? Hah.\n"New Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever."\nOr: IT'S ALL RUSSIA'S FAULT! GO! BE AMERICAN!\n"Various Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play – either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode."\nAt least they didn't screw up THIS.\n"Bullet-Cam: everyone’s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the transfer of kinetic energy – a bullet’s true stopping power – can do to the enemy from 1000 meters or more!"\nWe need a bullet-cam! -Every sniper game EVER\n"Bullet Penetration: concealment doesn’t necessarily mean cover. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad. Wait ‘til you see that on Bullet Cam!"\nOk, i'm done with cons for this one.THIS...it's nice. Yep. That's it.\n"Expanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world’s most advanced sniper rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately simulate the modern weaponry found on today’s battlefields."\nModern weaponry? AHHAHAHAHAHA! So funny.\n"New Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating the enemy before they spot you."\nWhat is this? Splintel Cell?\nAnd that's not all!\nThis game has multiplayer. SNIPER MULTIPLAYER. Just imagine that.\nIt also has 3 expansions:\nDigital Extras: Soundtrack (it's good)+4 MP characters for...18,99? Really? I mean, come on, CI Games! That's just too much!\nSiberian Strike: Blah blah russians are bad kill them blah blah\nWorld Hunter: 4 new MP maps. Good enough it's cheap.\nSo, is this game worth buying?\nNo, unless you like soundtracks (wait, it's on Youtube? nvm then) or you'd like Splinter Cell in first person.\n3/10 for me.\n\n*EDIT* I said only cons, didn't I? Welp, here's a list of pros:\n1.Pretty good soundtrack - It says for itself.\n2.Low specifications - It still looks awful, don't get me wrong, but you can run it on a low-end computer just fine.\n3.Smooth gameplay - They kinda screwed up this. The gameplay is very smooth sometimes, and sometimes it's like my computer is a potato.\nAand that's it. No more. Well, maybe that story wasn't too bad, but it ain't The Last of Us' level.\nCertainly not.","May 19","false","4.8"," 2 of 19 people (11%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","11","2","19","4","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LetoAtreidesII/recommended/34870/","LetoAtreidesII","Leto Atreides II","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LetoAtreidesII/","946 products in account","Despite my dislike of modern military shooters and my added mental handicap when it comes to stealth gameplay - I really suck at stealth - I have a soft spot for any game that provides me with a good sniping experience. I mean the sniper is my favorite TF2 class and there's basically no realism about that, but I still enjoy it a lot.\n\nSo I obviously picked up the original "Sniper: Ghost Warrior", despite what I've heard. Thankfully I only paid €1 for it because it really wasn't all that good. It had to much faffing about in between the actual sniping and seemed to want to thrust in more close-combat sections way to often, so I never finished it. Because in addition to that, the enemy AI was terribly unforgiving and could spot me from ludicrous distances. Likewise, I picked up "Sniper Elite V2" when it was offered for free on Steam a couple of days ago. And similar to the first "Sniper: Ghost Warrior" it seemed way to concerned with having me get more into the action and as such, I lost interest really quickly. It didn't help that it looked terrible, even for the time, with shoddy textures, horrible animation quality, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aesthetic, etc. The sniping was fun yes, but at the cost of having an empty world that failed to engage me, so I stopped playing a couple of hours in.\n\nAfter that, I saw that Bundle Stars had "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2" in a bundle over there, and even if it were the only game that piqued my interest in that particular bundle - which it wasn't - I could justify buying it for €3.66 instead of the full price of €20.\n\nLet me begin with saying that this game isn't worth €20, for multiple reasons. For one, the single-player campaign is criminally short. It took me 5.2 hours according to Steam to get through the story, including my personal ham-handedness when it comes to stealth, so I assume better gamers will finish it even quicker than that. The story is really disjointed and makes the world feel really small. I mean it takes place in the Philippines, Sarajevo and Tibet and yet the main players are all the same 5 guys all the time, it's like this was conceived as a James Bond game instead of a realistic depiction of arms dealing. It's also one of those tired old military bravado revenge stories, because we always need something personal about it to justify going off protocol. And while the graphics aren't bad per se (and I'm by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥), I've seen better, especially out of the CryEngine 3. Worth noting is that the graphics in the pre-rendered cut-scenes are substantially worse than the in-game graphics, which is quite a feat.\n\nHowever, despite all those criticisms, I had fun playing it. Yes, it's horribly linear and bares little resemblance to what actual snipers have to do in real life, but here's the thing: I don't want my games to be recreations of life. I want my games to be escapism, and this provided me with what I sought for in a sniping game. It holds your hands a lot on the lower difficulties, but you can find a challenge here if you're looking for it. And for what it's worth, it really is committed to its theme of sniping and sneaking around. You can't absorb damage like in most other shooters and there isn't regenerating health. This is kind of an ambivalent point because for one it takes actual skill to get through the game, but on the other hand, it leads to a very tight level design that basically railroads you through if you need to use stealth. And with the aggressive linearity comes the heavy scripting of scenes that kill my immersion somewhat. I mean, there's an entire section where a cave system is collapsing around you and I never felt threatened, because a) I know it's a scripted sequence and b) my running speed is faster than the running speed of my AI partner.\n\nSpeaking of that AI partner, it really adds a lot to the game. Especially in comparison to "Sniper Elite V2" where you were just this lone wolf going around Berlin. Even if the dialogue is just terrible, it just makes the game more appealing to me and opens up some characterization. I mean it's not very realistic to have a spotter armed with a regular assault rifle being able to take out targets at the same distance and accuracy as me with my sniper rifle, but I'll gladly overlook that in favor of having a bit of dialogue in there, regardless of its quality.\n\nThe game doesn't seem to be too taxing, at least not on my machine. I cranked up all the settings to max and found that the game ran at 80-110 fps depending on locations, and this is with the CryEngine 3 so at least it's not badly optimized.\n\nMy final verdict on this one is that I can recommend it to fans of sniping gameplay, but only if you can find it at a heavy discount, because 20 bucks for 5 hours is way too much. I paid less than a dollar for it when I bought the bundle, and for that it's great value.","June 9, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sniping is realistic, bullet drop and wind correction are amazingly accurate and the constant changing of vantage points give you motivation to take down as many targets as possible so you are clear to move.

You can argue that all you want but having played it myself and not gotten a refund, I won't listen. The shooting mechanics offer some variety on the higher difficulty settings but overall the lack of challenging shots leaves a lot to be desired. The positioning aspect of the game amounts to walking along a predetermined path to painfully obvious hides. You take out a few waves of enemies with your high powered rifle.

Hahaha. No. Lets start with the singleplayer. Let me just start by saying this game is no where near "story driven". The story is generic mess, with unbelievable hard to remember characters. The game really fails to draw you into the enviornment and really does a poor job of character development. If there is any. Most of the in game dialogue is just "good shot partner" and "nice kill". The rest of it is just you being scolded by your commander. The animations are incredibly janky and so is the voice acting..oh god the voice acting. Player models are compressed messes as well, and every enemy pretty much looks exactly the same. There is no more than two different player models for each type of enemy you face. The game also tries to dish (And I am assuming) heart wrenching drama by showing you the acts of genocide comitted in the Balkans in the 90s. To be honest, it was so generic it was very hard to take it seriously. The main villian is dull, and quiet weird. (Not in the good way) I saw myself constantly skipping the cutscenes, and just trying to get the missions over with. The "bossfight" is just some dude with aimbot. The game really is not challenging, and the detection system can be quite laggy at some points. You could be crawling on your belly in the bushes and be detected or crouching in the middle of a road and pretty much be a ninja. Overall I would give the story a 5/10. At some points it can be quite fun, but most of the time it is just dull, and feels more like a mini game or challenge instead of an actual story mission.\n\nThe multiplayer is a bit of a different story, that is if you can find a server. I found that getting kills was quite satisfying, but lag and poor hit detection seemed to ruin it alot. Customization is probably the most disappointing thing about the MP. All you can do is choose a gun out of like 5-7 max, and a random player model from the story. There is alot of problems with connection and hacking, and the guess what the only guns are: thats right. Sniper rifles...instead of actually mixing it up and perhaps having just one sniper on one team and the rest regulars who the sniper must support, the decided to make everyone snipers, and just have them kill each other. Quite a disappointment. Overall I would give the game a 5/10. And I would recommend only picking it up when its on sale for a dirt cheap price for around 6 bucks like I did. Thats the only way you will get your moneys worth.","May 22, 2014","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The textures aren't high res enough, leaves on bushes look like something out of a 2D game, and animations are horrible at some points (I'm looking at you "crouching without weapon" animation).\n\nThe enemies are extremely repetetive, and "thrown in" to levels without much thought behind it.\nAlmost every sniper on roof tops wears a ghillie suit, which doesn't make much sense...\n\nThe story is of course cliché and reminds you of any movie made in the 90's, the voice acting isn't very good, but it's not that bad either. . This leads to the fact that you don't care about the characters, not even yourself.\n\nAnd my biggest issue with this game...\nIt doesn't let you play anything remotely to what a sniper would do.\n70% of the story is forcing you to play a crappy first person version of splinter cell forced into the "on-rails" experience of call-of-duty.\n\nYou want to play a sniping game, get Sniper Elite or Arma 3.\nGet this if you want to play a half ♥♥♥♥♥ call of duty with only sniper rifles.","March 2, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlbrn/recommended/34870/","chlbrn","Charlie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlbrn/","432 products in account","First of all, CI games did many weird things these years. They own CryEngine and develop Ghost Warrior 2 with it. But they switched to UE 3 to develop Alien Rage, and when they cooperated with Deck 13, all of sudden, they had an in-house engine to develop Lords of the Fallen. I still cannot figure out why they don't have consistency in development cycles.\nAside from that, here is my review.\n1. Graphics looks terrible. It is not about DX9 or the CryEngine. I don't know, but it looks bad.\n2. sound effects are pretty good I have to admit, and the voice acting is good as well.\n3. Too many bugs and glitches. Sometimes, bugs happened just before the checkpoint, when that happens, every time you reload to last checkpoint, the bugs will take effects making it unplayable and you can only start the entire level again.\n4. Gameplay is ok, using sniper rifle is fun. But this is not a good sniper or stealth game.\n5. There must be something wrong with this game. It really feels like playing COD. The level intro looks like MW 1&2.\nI know this is a military game, but Splinter Cell Blacklist has the level intro which feels different, and BF's level intro is different either.\nIn conclusion, this game is not bad but not good, just average to play, maybe you can find something you like in this game, and when it is on sale, maybe a good purchase. 5.5/10","December 22, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/efstajas/recommended/34870/","efstajas","jason","http://steamcommunity.com/id/efstajas/","404 products in account","This game has many enjoyable aspects to it, such as the pretty great feeling when sniping, the good- looking graphics and the amazing killcams over 1000 meters.\n\nHowever - the singleplayer campaign was one of the worst campaigns in video game history that I have ever played.\n\nThe whole thing felt extremely forced upon you - no way to do anything by yourself. Literally every stealth kill you take is dictated. While I generally enjoy linear games for their great attention to detail and often great storytelling, this game has neither of these aspects, but still is one of the most linear shooters I have ever seen, leading to a rather boring experience that makes you feel like the clown in a theater play.\n\nThe story is uninspired - I didn't care at all about any of the NPCs in the game, at any point - I probably couldn't name any name from the campaign right now. The voice acting however is pretty solid, but nothing special. The characters did not evolve in any real way, I could pretty much tell from the beginning what they were going to act like.\n\nThe mechanics in the SP campaign are standard- esque. I enjoy the fact that the game does not have regenerating health, and requires you to at least somewhat care about medpacks. You actually die from very few shots, even on easier difficulities. The stealth mechanic however felt a little awkward for me at times - you could literally play peek-a-bo with a wall of enemies from behind a ledge, and none of the enemies would even blink. What's missing here is a visible "curiousity" state in between unaware and spotted, where enemies go to check out something suspicious they believe they have seen.\n\nSo, all in all - if you're for some quick sniper action without any real depth, without any great gameplay, go for it. I would definitely not recommend the game at full price, unless you ABSOLUTELY enjoy campaigns like the CoD ones (even though those normally are a little better than this one) and sniping missions. If you can snatch it for below 10€, I would say that the amount of fun can definitely makes up for the price.","December 22, 2013","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What. If you 're reading this , look pass the score. it doesnt make much sence, I even saw people gave it '0' in metacritic.com Don't hate it , try it first. Sniper : Ghost warrior 1 is a crap. And i concured on that. But This one is something you should try. The singleplayer campaign can deliver you more fun than Battlefield 3 (singleplayer) 's.There 're some of the 'Call of Duty moments too , lots of Hollywood - driven scenes'\n\nSome people might think 'Hey if this game is as fun as those others good FPS (+ Sniping / Stealth) , then what's new in it?' My answer is Beside the fact that you have more chance to snipe and sneaking / crawling than other FPS games , No. Nothing new here. But Why not ? Why not get it if you saw the price drop to 7$ , 4.99$ ? Like i did. And I have to say that it's FUN.\n\nPros :\n\n-Beautiful graphic (Thanks to CryEngine3) in ACT 1 - forest , it's kinda dark and too greenish there but after that in Bosnia and Tibet (ACT 2 - 3) The graphic will start to shine. As good as - better than Battlefield 3 / Medal of Honor 2012. I really like Bosnia and Tibet. The level designing , the buildings and those decorations are an art , espacially Tibet , VERY stunning.\n\n-Bulletcam made a comeback.\n\n-Storyline is ok , nothing special but not bad either.\n\n-You always carry either Thermal cam or Night Vision one , Which are very useful to use in nearly every chapters. Good + fun tool.\n\n-Improved AI , they 're way smarter than the previous one , when you start shooting , they will duck and get to the nearest cover. and try to swarm you from multiple directions if they have a chance.\n\n-Realistic bulletdrop\n\n-Good voice acting.\n\n-A lot of Cut scene.\n\n-Realistic HP , even in medium difficulty you can still die easily within 2 sec. if you got spray'd by enemy rifles.\n\n-Sniping + play like a Hitman is fun and satisfying.\n\n\nCons :\n\n-Length , it's short. Singleplaye clocked around 5 hours and 1.5 hours for the DLC (Based on my Medium difficulty gameplay)\n\n-Multiplayer is kinda empty.\n\n-Unrealistic enemies at some chapters e.g. You are about to engage large group of enemies from Hilltop with Unsuppressed Barette XM500 Sniper rifle. You followed what AI told you to do. When you shot an Ememy he told u to. Another enemies who stood around 20 m. next to there still acted the same (stay on  their course like nothing happen). even your gun is unsuppressed O_O\n\n-You will never have a chance to use some cool sniper rifles (VSS Vintorez , DSR-50 , Accuracy International Arctic warfare 50) because they saved it for the multiplayer and yet multiplayer is deserted and empty , so. you lost that chance eventually.\n\n*PS. The Singleplayer DLC 'Siberian Strike' have more things to offer. Huge map , Good post - soviet vibe of Siberia , because of the size of the map you can create your own strategy of killing.\n\n\n7.4 / 10\n\n'Don't hate it , It's actually FUN'   and remember , one shot one kill , people :)\n","October 7, 2013","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hahaha. No. Lets start with the singleplayer. Let me just start by saying this game is no where near "story driven". The story is generic mess, with unbelievable hard to remember characters. The game really fails to draw you into the enviornment and really does a poor job of character development. If there is any. Most of the in game dialogue is just "good shot partner" and "nice kill". The rest of it is just you being scolded by your commander. The animations are incredibly janky and so is the voice acting..oh god the voice acting. Player models are compressed messes as well, and every enemy pretty much looks exactly the same. There is no more than two different player models for each type of enemy you face. The game also tries to dish (And I am assuming) heart wrenching drama by showing you the acts of genocide comitted in the Balkans in the 90s. To be honest, it was so generic it was very hard to take it seriously. The main villian is dull, and quiet weird. (Not in the good way) I saw myself constantly skipping the cutscenes, and just trying to get the missions over with. The "bossfight" is just some dude with aimbot. The game really is not challenging, and the detection system can be quite laggy at some points. You could be crawling on your belly in the bushes and be detected or crouching in the middle of a road and pretty much be a ninja. Overall I would give the story a 5/10. At some points it can be quite fun, but most of the time it is just dull, and feels more like a mini game or challenge instead of an actual story mission.\n\nThe multiplayer is a bit of a different story, that is if you can find a server. I found that getting kills was quite satisfying, but lag and poor hit detection seemed to ruin it alot. Customization is probably the most disappointing thing about the MP. All you can do is choose a gun out of like 5-7 max, and a random player model from the story. There is alot of problems with connection and hacking, and the guess what the only guns are: thats right. Sniper rifles...instead of actually mixing it up and perhaps having just one sniper on one team and the rest regulars who the sniper must support, the decided to make everyone snipers, and just have them kill each other. Quite a disappointment. Overall I would give the game a 5/10. And I would recommend only picking it up when its on sale for a dirt cheap price for around 6 bucks like I did.

Unlike the first game, you're not stuck in a jungle the whole time, you actually get to experience urban combat. Extremely satisfying as a sniper.\n\nThere is no CoD-esque combat like in the first game. You stick purely to your rifle and pistol, which in this game was the best way to go. (Obviously.)\n\nThe A.I. is average, along with the dialogue and story, and characters.\n\nI would say all around it's a good game, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys an action packed sniper game with a few silly quirks.","June 5, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Search online and you'll see many others reporting the same thing: Enemies and certain environmental objects are sometimes completely invisible. They're not supposed to be invisible; this is a bug. I tried DX9 and DX11 and other settings, and I could not work around this bug.\n\nI also had an issue with the NPC I was supposed to be following simply coming to a complete stop, which prevented the game from progressing. There was no way for me to get it going again other than to lose progress, reload, and hope it didn't happen again. But it kept happening again and again, at different points in the game.\n\nBoth bugs were infuriating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LetoAtreidesII/recommended/34870/","LetoAtreidesII","Leto Atreides II","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LetoAtreidesII/","946 products in account","Despite my dislike of modern military shooters and my added mental handicap when it comes to stealth gameplay - I really suck at stealth - I have a soft spot for any game that provides me with a good sniping experience. I mean the sniper is my favorite TF2 class and there's basically no realism about that, but I still enjoy it a lot.\n\nSo I obviously picked up the original "Sniper: Ghost Warrior", despite what I've heard. Thankfully I only paid €1 for it because it really wasn't all that good. It had to much faffing about in between the actual sniping and seemed to want to thrust in more close-combat sections way to often, so I never finished it. Because in addition to that, the enemy AI was terribly unforgiving and could spot me from ludicrous distances. Likewise, I picked up "Sniper Elite V2" when it was offered for free on Steam a couple of days ago. And similar to the first "Sniper: Ghost Warrior" it seemed way to concerned with having me get more into the action and as such, I lost interest really quickly. It didn't help that it looked terrible, even for the time, with shoddy textures, horrible animation quality, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aesthetic, etc. The sniping was fun yes, but at the cost of having an empty world that failed to engage me, so I stopped playing a couple of hours in.\n\nAfter that, I saw that Bundle Stars had "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2" in a bundle over there, and even if it were the only game that piqued my interest in that particular bundle - which it wasn't - I could justify buying it for €3.66 instead of the full price of €20.\n\nLet me begin with saying that this game isn't worth €20, for multiple reasons. For one, the single-player campaign is criminally short. It took me 5.2 hours according to Steam to get through the story, including my personal ham-handedness when it comes to stealth, so I assume better gamers will finish it even quicker than that. The story is really disjointed and makes the world feel really small. I mean it takes place in the Philippines, Sarajevo and Tibet and yet the main players are all the same 5 guys all the time, it's like this was conceived as a James Bond game instead of a realistic depiction of arms dealing. It's also one of those tired old military bravado revenge stories, because we always need something personal about it to justify going off protocol. And while the graphics aren't bad per se (and I'm by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥), I've seen better, especially out of the CryEngine 3. Worth noting is that the graphics in the pre-rendered cut-scenes are substantially worse than the in-game graphics, which is quite a feat.\n\nHowever, despite all those criticisms, I had fun playing it. Yes, it's horribly linear and bares little resemblance to what actual snipers have to do in real life, but here's the thing: I don't want my games to be recreations of life. I want my games to be escapism, and this provided me with what I sought for in a sniping game. It holds your hands a lot on the lower difficulties, but you can find a challenge here if you're looking for it. And for what it's worth, it really is committed to its theme of sniping and sneaking around. You can't absorb damage like in most other shooters and there isn't regenerating health. This is kind of an ambivalent point because for one it takes actual skill to get through the game, but on the other hand, it leads to a very tight level design that basically railroads you through if you need to use stealth. And with the aggressive linearity comes the heavy scripting of scenes that kill my immersion somewhat. I mean, there's an entire section where a cave system is collapsing around you and I never felt threatened, because a) I know it's a scripted sequence and b) my running speed is faster than the running speed of my AI partner.\n\nSpeaking of that AI partner, it really adds a lot to the game. Especially in comparison to "Sniper Elite V2" where you were just this lone wolf going around Berlin. Even if the dialogue is just terrible, it just makes the game more appealing to me and opens up some characterization. I mean it's not very realistic to have a spotter armed with a regular assault rifle being able to take out targets at the same distance and accuracy as me with my sniper rifle, but I'll gladly overlook that in favor of having a bit of dialogue in there, regardless of its quality.\n\nThe game doesn't seem to be too taxing, at least not on my machine. I cranked up all the settings to max and found that the game ran at 80-110 fps depending on locations, and this is with the CryEngine 3 so at least it's not badly optimized.\n\nMy final verdict on this one is that I can recommend it to fans of sniping gameplay, but only if you can find it at a heavy discount, because 20 bucks for 5 hours is way too much. I paid less than a dollar for it when I bought the bundle, and for that it's great value.","June 9, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now using CryEngine 3, S2 has improved visuals which really shows in the jungle levels. There's a lot of shooting to do, as you've been sent to go after lots of objectives, multiple locations, and you'll have to do plenty of stealth work as well, as you sneak past guards, silent kill sentries, make your way past sniper alley, and much more. Multiplayer can be a lot of fun too as you try to sneak your way to flags and whatnot.

Some missions are very challenging and hard which makes it a little bit fun, but when no good characters tell you what to do, you sometimes are stuck. Only smart, and very skilled people with the observational skills should complete the trick bits in some of the missions.\n\nOn the other hand, I like the way how this game has some realistic features to it. Such as showing the amount of air you have inside your lungs while you are swimming, you get medikits to heal yourself, and it shows your heartbeat rate! And when you are aiming at enemies with your sniper rifle, there is a red dot to reaveal where the bullet will ACTUALLY go, which is smart due to the wind blowing the bullet off where you want it to actually go. And the other thing is when you press the trigger, the bullet has a travel time, unlike other games where you press the trigger and in a 900th of a second it hits them already. So basically, you shoot and it hits before you know it. Unlike Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. Overall, to me it's a 67/100 rating.","March 2, 2014","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some missions are very challenging and hard which makes it a little bit fun, but when no good characters tell you what to do, you sometimes are stuck. Only smart, and very skilled people with the observational skills should complete the trick bits in some of the missions.\n\nOn the other hand, I like the way how this game has some realistic features to it. Such as showing the amount of air you have inside your lungs while you are swimming, you get medikits to heal yourself, and it shows your heartbeat rate! And when you are aiming at enemies with your sniper rifle, there is a red dot to reaveal where the bullet will ACTUALLY go, which is smart due to the wind blowing the bullet off where you want it to actually go. And the other thing is when you press the trigger, the bullet has a travel time, unlike other games where you press the trigger and in a 900th of a second it hits them already. So basically, you shoot and it hits before you know it. Unlike Sniper Ghost Warrior 2. Overall, to me it's a 67/100 rating.","March 2, 2014","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What. If you 're reading this , look pass the score. it doesnt make much sence, I even saw people gave it '0' in metacritic.com Don't hate it , try it first. Sniper : Ghost warrior 1 is a crap. And i concured on that. But This one is something you should try. The singleplayer campaign can deliver you more fun than Battlefield 3 (singleplayer) 's.There 're some of the 'Call of Duty moments too , lots of Hollywood - driven scenes'\n\nSome people might think 'Hey if this game is as fun as those others good FPS (+ Sniping / Stealth) , then what's new in it?' My answer is Beside the fact that you have more chance to snipe and sneaking / crawling than other FPS games , No. Nothing new here. But Why not ? Why not get it if you saw the price drop to 7$ , 4.99$ ? Like i did. And I have to say that it's FUN.\n\nPros :\n\n-Beautiful graphic (Thanks to CryEngine3) in ACT 1 - forest , it's kinda dark and too greenish there but after that in Bosnia and Tibet (ACT 2 - 3) The graphic will start to shine. As good as - better than Battlefield 3 / Medal of Honor 2012. I really like Bosnia and Tibet. The level designing , the buildings and those decorations are an art , espacially Tibet , VERY stunning.\n\n-Bulletcam made a comeback.\n\n-Storyline is ok , nothing special but not bad either.\n\n-You always carry either Thermal cam or Night Vision one , Which are very useful to use in nearly every chapters. Good + fun tool.\n\n-Improved AI , they 're way smarter than the previous one , when you start shooting , they will duck and get to the nearest cover. and try to swarm you from multiple directions if they have a chance.\n\n-Realistic bulletdrop\n\n-Good voice acting.\n\n-A lot of Cut scene.\n\n-Realistic HP , even in medium difficulty you can still die easily within 2 sec. if you got spray'd by enemy rifles.\n\n-Sniping + play like a Hitman is fun and satisfying.\n\n\nCons :\n\n-Length , it's short. Singleplaye clocked around 5 hours and 1.5 hours for the DLC (Based on my Medium difficulty gameplay)\n\n-Multiplayer is kinda empty.\n\n-Unrealistic enemies at some chapters e.g. You are about to engage large group of enemies from Hilltop with Unsuppressed Barette XM500 Sniper rifle. You followed what AI told you to do. When you shot an Ememy he told u to. Another enemies who stood around 20 m. next to there still acted the same (stay on  their course like nothing happen). even your gun is unsuppressed O_O\n\n-You will never have a chance to use some cool sniper rifles (VSS Vintorez , DSR-50 , Accuracy International Arctic warfare 50) because they saved it for the multiplayer and yet multiplayer is deserted and empty , so. you lost that chance eventually.\n\n*PS. The Singleplayer DLC 'Siberian Strike' have more things to offer. Huge map , Good post - soviet vibe of Siberia , because of the size of the map you can create your own strategy of killing.\n\n\n7.4 / 10\n\n'Don't hate it , It's actually FUN'   and remember , one shot one kill , people :)\n","October 7, 2013","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get Sniper Elite 2 or 3 instead of this.  But it's worth it if you get it on sale.\n\nI tried really hard to like this, but after playing Sniper Elite 2 and 3, this just doesn't come anywhere close.  I think if I'd played this first, I would have enjoyed it a lot more because it's a decent game in it's own right.\n\nBut things is does terribly wrong:\n\n* Single player campaign is too short.  I finished it in under 6 hours.  (I positive I've spent more time on a single level in Sniper Elite 3!)\n* It's too scripted.  Try to leave the mission area, or complete a task in any way other than directed, and you alert all the troops.\n* There's no thought involved. Just follow your AI spotter and shoot the enemies in the order that he tags them.\n\nI'm going to play through once more on highest difficulty and see if it's more enjoyable.  There's also a DLC pack which promises to be more open and less scripted, which also has better reviews, so I'll try that at some point too.

There are several different kinds of sniper rifles (MSR, M24, M82A1, etc.), but the only other weapon you have to use is a suppressed pistol, firing which feels like shooting a BB gun. The voice acting is horribly bad, and I do mean BAD. The game is almost played for you unless you are playing on the hardest difficulty. Everything is spelled out for you almost exactly, including where to go, who to kill and in what order, and where every last enemy is. On that note, enemies are lifeless. You might as well be shooting at mannequins. They will randomly spew out different phrases in Russian(?), from, I believe, a pool of set quotes. This being an FPS I'm not too surprised. The game also 'borrows' tricks and gimmicks from Call of Duty 4 rather frequently... I won't give any spoilers though.\n\nDespite all this, environments are verdant and, though linear, well-designed as far as visuals go. The sniper aspect is, though somewhat inaccurate, challenging enough; firing a shot at the wrong time will have several automatic rifles firing in your direction, a bit pulse-pounding, but this is easily avoided, because, even though bullets can fly straight through enemies and hit a piece of metal behind them, resulting in a loud 'pang' sound, this will still not alert them. In fact I'm sure the only way to get detected is to stand in their direct line of sight, and even then it takes a few seconds for them to notice you. It's also apparent that you are playing as a perfectly weightless man, because you cannot hear your footsteps at all - I'm serious, they are completely silent. Because of this, you can sprint up behing an enemy and stab him with no difficulty at all.\n\nDefinitely one of my less enjoyed shooters, but at least the sniping is a bit (and I do mean a VERY SMALL BIT) more realistic than Call of Duty.","July 18, 2013","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether it be the sniper bullet blowing up a hand grenade on an enemy's belt, or just a good ol' fashioned melee from behind, you have to choose not only your manner of killing, but the timing, very carefully.  After playing through most of the campaign once on Normal, I can definitely see the replay value for this game on hard, or just for fun on easy.\n\nMultiplayer wise I only needed a few matches to see what this game is.  Sniping, camping, and painfully slow-paced.  It's a sniper game where you only get snipers essentially... if you've played enough CoD or Battlefield, you know exactly what that means.\n\nAll in all, if you want this game for the campaign/single player content, definitely worth a few playthroughs.  If you're looking for an obscure multiplayer FPS for some reason.... keep looking.  Fortunately, I bought this for the former of those two, and was not disappointed.","February 5, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This makes hard difficulty the only possible way to have the long range sniping experience.  But then, even on hard the AI is too dumb to deal with you, just shoots accurately.  Follow your spotters instructions when in combat and watch as the AI clears your path for you during the mandatory stealth sections.  Things can go wrong and devolve into a shoot-out, but since everything dies in one shot to the torso, finesse is basically optional.  This is not a game designed to challenge your playing abilities, merely to challenge your ability to do exactly what you're told at exactly the right time.\n\nA story exists, but it is not memorable and serves more as a crutch to carry you through the missions on rails while your spotter is there to hold your hand and make sure you don't do anything like make your own decisions.  A personal grievance I had was the game stressing the importance of stealth during two sections that made you rely on only your pistol and a few rounds of bullets while you pretend the guy you just knifed was not carrying a gun.  Not a gamebreaker, because you don't encounter more targets than you have ammo during these sections and they can all be taken out with a knife.  But it is a testament to lazy storytelling, trying to instill a sensation that simply does not run parallel to what the game is having you do.\n\nLooks pretty though.  But what Cryengine game doesn't.","January 12, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/efstajas/recommended/34870/","efstajas","jason","http://steamcommunity.com/id/efstajas/","404 products in account","This game has many enjoyable aspects to it, such as the pretty great feeling when sniping, the good- looking graphics and the amazing killcams over 1000 meters.\n\nHowever - the singleplayer campaign was one of the worst campaigns in video game history that I have ever played.\n\nThe whole thing felt extremely forced upon you - no way to do anything by yourself. Literally every stealth kill you take is dictated. While I generally enjoy linear games for their great attention to detail and often great storytelling, this game has neither of these aspects, but still is one of the most linear shooters I have ever seen, leading to a rather boring experience that makes you feel like the clown in a theater play.\n\nThe story is uninspired - I didn't care at all about any of the NPCs in the game, at any point - I probably couldn't name any name from the campaign right now. The voice acting however is pretty solid, but nothing special. The characters did not evolve in any real way, I could pretty much tell from the beginning what they were going to act like.\n\nThe mechanics in the SP campaign are standard- esque. I enjoy the fact that the game does not have regenerating health, and requires you to at least somewhat care about medpacks. You actually die from very few shots, even on easier difficulities. The stealth mechanic however felt a little awkward for me at times - you could literally play peek-a-bo with a wall of enemies from behind a ledge, and none of the enemies would even blink. What's missing here is a visible "curiousity" state in between unaware and spotted, where enemies go to check out something suspicious they believe they have seen.\n\nSo, all in all - if you're for some quick sniper action without any real depth, without any great gameplay, go for it. I would definitely not recommend the game at full price, unless you ABSOLUTELY enjoy campaigns like the CoD ones (even though those normally are a little better than this one) and sniping missions. If you can snatch it for below 10€, I would say that the amount of fun can definitely makes up for the price.","December 22, 2013","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead I got a linear restricted and buggy experience.  The fact that it was made in cryengine seems to mean nothing as its textures remind me of early cod. However as a casual shooter with no care for deep story or customisability, it isn't too bad.  The sniping is realistic, bullet drop and wind correction are amazingly accurate and the constant changing of vantage points give you motivation to take down as many targets as possible so you are clear to move.  It also has a slight crysis 1 / far cry 3 feel at times which can create a sense of comfort every now and then.","June 15, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Remember that level where you run through Pripyat as a sniper and take out the bad guy with your .50? Basically that. An entire game of that. Just that.\n\nWith a bug list that rivals Goat Simulator and a story so easy to predict it left me wincing, Sniper: Ghost Warrior is back.\nThe original Sniper: Ghost Warrior game was terrible. You can argue that all you want but having played it myself and not gotten a refund, I won't listen. The shooting mechanics offer some variety on the higher difficulty settings but overall the lack of challenging shots leaves a lot to be desired. The positioning aspect of the game amounts to walking along a predetermined path to painfully obvious hides. You take out a few waves of enemies with your high powered rifle. You move on to the next level.\n\nWhile this is no-punches-pulled for what the game advertises, I find it hard to justify the price when a much more competent competitor lets you enjoy shooting Hitler between the legs. If you want a ballistics simulation get either Sniper Elite v2 or Arma 3.\n\nIf you want that Pripyat level of Call of Duty for an entire game, look no further.","June 16, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are several different kinds of sniper rifles (MSR, M24, M82A1, etc.), but the only other weapon you have to use is a suppressed pistol, firing which feels like shooting a BB gun. The voice acting is horribly bad, and I do mean BAD. The game is almost played for you unless you are playing on the hardest difficulty. Everything is spelled out for you almost exactly, including where to go, who to kill and in what order, and where every last enemy is. On that note, enemies are lifeless. You might as well be shooting at mannequins. They will randomly spew out different phrases in Russian(?), from, I believe, a pool of set quotes. This being an FPS I'm not too surprised. The game also 'borrows' tricks and gimmicks from Call of Duty 4 rather frequently... I won't give any spoilers though.\n\nDespite all this, environments are verdant and, though linear, well-designed as far as visuals go. The sniper aspect is, though somewhat inaccurate, challenging enough; firing a shot at the wrong time will have several automatic rifles firing in your direction, a bit pulse-pounding, but this is easily avoided, because, even though bullets can fly straight through enemies and hit a piece of metal behind them, resulting in a loud 'pang' sound, this will still not alert them. In fact I'm sure the only way to get detected is to stand in their direct line of sight, and even then it takes a few seconds for them to notice you. It's also apparent that you are playing as a perfectly weightless man, because you cannot hear your footsteps at all - I'm serious, they are completely silent. Because of this, you can sprint up behing an enemy and stab him with no difficulty at all.\n\nDefinitely one of my less enjoyed shooters, but at least the sniping is a bit (and I do mean a VERY SMALL BIT) more realistic than Call of Duty.","July 18, 2013","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can perhaps see why it's been slated - no awkward fiddly grappling hook that you struggle to remember the rather unintuitive controls for (yes plural - you first have to select it, then you have to activate it, then you have to press yet more keys to use it). But hello, you really enjoy being a sniper, you see a game called "Sniper 2 : Ghost Warrior", you just want to go sniping! Or am I missing the point somewhere.\nThe game does feel a little on rails, but that's still fine with me - it still lets you explore a bit but if you wander too far you get a 5 second countdown to get back to the mission area. The level of detail within the game is really quite something. The locations are very varied and I felt like James Bond going all over the world on my missions - if not always to the most glamorous of locales. Also the developer has made a far better use of the Far Cry 3 engine than the developers of Far Cry 3 itself have. One rather nice difference between this game and Far Cry 3 are the lack of bullet proof leaves.\nIf you want an all action title with a sandbox feature, go to Just Cause 2. If you really, really enjoy picking people off from afar, get this game. It is not that long, but in this case it's definitely quality not quantity. The game feels polished and finished. How many games can you really honestly say that for in this day and age?","February 16, 2015","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's literally the same gameplay over and over again.\n\nIn general I like the idea and details but there is not much differences between the guns and in lenght the game gets pretty boring as well, because in the campaign there is only 1 specific way to go, so completing it again will not gain you anything else, than your pleasure of shooting and silently murdering people for good, satisfied.\n\nAs you might see here, I have only played for 8 hrs. It took me 5 hrs to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty, then I jumped onto the multiplayer section for about 30 minutes until it got boring. I have multiple times started the game up again ever since, but when I played the singleplayer for ~30 minutes I got bored again and closed it.\n\nTo be honest there was some of the campaign missions where I got stuck, since the checkpoint system made me spawn in a spot where all the enemies could spot me instantly, so the only way to progress was to quick spot all the enemies and start spraying with my pistol or other offhand weapon... Not so much silence and sniper game anymore...\n\nOn a scale from 1-10 I would rate it about 6.5.\n\nIt needs something in the content to make it seems like worth the money; it just doesn't right now.\n\nMy advice to a potential buyer: Only buy it if you save a lot of money, or if it's money that you don't need ;) and ofcourse if you like FPS games, where you are sniping and love the silence kill-streak.\nI mean, just considering the amount of money for a 5 hrs game.","February 5, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely the best sniper game i've played. However i think the single campaign was too short.\nFinished the entire game plus DLC in about 12 hours. That's not too much considering the price for the game.\n\nI also tried some multiplayer but that was just too lame.\nI don't blame the lameness on the developers though, but on the community.\nMost of the people just wanted to spawn, find a good spot and then lie there staring at the building with the enemies on the other side of the map until they eventually spotted an enemey and fired or got fired upon and died without noticing where it came from.\nTo add another dimension to this, and perhaps to counter this kind of boring gameplay, the developers have added the possibility to cross an open field and get to the enemies house on the other side.\nThat was a good thing i thought. That would add a risk of camping and just staring down a scope, or hiding too well so you cant get a good overview - for ex to spot an enemy crossing.\nCrossing the field to the enemys would indeed be risky, but if you manage you would get an advantage on people staring blindly down their scopes. This could also be a benefit for your own team, as you would 'stir things up' in the enemies building, causing them to move and thereby opening up shots for your team.\n\nHowever, this interesting aspect of the game was utterly crushed by the people who just want to find a cozy corner, camp it out and hope to get a lucky shot.\nThe crushing consisted of public yelling in chat "No crossing! No crossing! No crossing!".\nIf their will was not obliged, they whent to the length of killing their own team if they reached the enemies building.\n\nSo, if you're feeling bored and want to become even more bored. Go play Ghost Warrior 2 Multiplayer, cause boredom is all you'll get out of it.\n\nSplendid single campaign though. Well made sniper game well worth trying out. But abit low on play hours for the price.","February 6, 2014","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The textures aren't high res enough, leaves on bushes look like something out of a 2D game, and animations are horrible at some points (I'm looking at you "crouching without weapon" animation).\n\nThe enemies are extremely repetetive, and "thrown in" to levels without much thought behind it.\nAlmost every sniper on roof tops wears a ghillie suit, which doesn't make much sense...\n\nThe story is of course cliché and reminds you of any movie made in the 90's, the voice acting isn't very good, but it's not that bad either. . This leads to the fact that you don't care about the characters, not even yourself.\n\nAnd my biggest issue with this game...\nIt doesn't let you play anything remotely to what a sniper would do.\n70% of the story is forcing you to play a crappy first person version of splinter cell forced into the "on-rails" experience of call-of-duty.\n\nYou want to play a sniping game, get Sniper Elite or Arma 3.\nGet this if you want to play a half ♥♥♥♥♥ call of duty with only sniper rifles.","March 2, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy it off of ♥♥♥. I got mine for $5. and that's about how much this game is really worth. I mean yeah, it looks nice, Cryengine 3 does not mess around. It's one of my Favorite game Engine's. But, other then that. The story really does not make you feel attacthed to the characters, it has about a 4 hour run time, its bland, you don't even get to know the main protagonist really. And this is coming from someone who actually played the first Sniper Ghost Worrior. And probably put a good 60 hours into that game. But, the online for this game is almost not even their. I have not been able to find a server to play the online. So yeah, in short. If you're wanting to play this game, buy it off of ♥♥♥, beat the single player, then uninstall it.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the single player: Buggy, broken/missing textures. At one point during act 2 (I think) where I had to set up the 50. cal. This piece of wood was in my way and I could not see this guy I had to shot. Causing my guys on the ground to die till I had to completly restart the game. And holy ♥♥♥♥ you legit die in 2 shots. I started this game on med difficulty and holy crap talk about mega glass cannon. But, saying that it does make it more realistic I guess. So if you're one of those low attention spain used to taking 9 shots to the chest before you die Call Of Duty players, then this game IS NOT FOR YOU. But saying that, if you're looking for a more realistic sniping experience then yeah, get this from ♥♥♥.\n\nYeah its a cool game in a way, but with all the stuff listed above. I will not be coming back to this game any more. So yeah, buy at your own risk I guess :p if you rage really easy (like me) then you're PROABABLY going to have a rough time starting out. But afterwords once you get used to the aiming machinics of this game. You'll be fine.\n\nPersonal rating I would have to give this game a 6/10. If they would go and fix this missing/broken textures, and maybe made it where the character's had more to them, AND MADE THE STORY LONGER, then yeah. This would be a pretty good game. I just hope the next SGW game is better.","May 4, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could be my setup that it doesn't like but other reviews mention crashes too, so if that's something you aren't prepared to risk you should avoid this game.","January 17","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Multiplayer is boring, just a bunch of people camping 24/7. Definatly not as fun as Sniper Ghost warrior 1 but was still a good game with alot better graphics (excluding cutscenes which were ugly as) 7/10","January 19","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is ok, and being a sniper is kind of cool, but everything else just sucks. It's extremely linear and frustraiting with loads of awfuly badly animated charachters, brain-dead AI and pointless missions. The performance is bad - the game is not optimized at all and I don't know how you can make CryEngine 3 game look this bad. 3 / 10","December 22, 2013","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They always seem to have some pretty good graphics but they always tend to go corny on the story.  Sniper 2 was quite a bit better than the previous ghost warrior or in other words, I  liked this one.  All the environments are really well done and you could actually pick people off without alerting the whole map every time(unlike the original where as soon as you shot somebody the entire map knew where you were and would come after you full force) .\n\nThe good:\n\n\nVery nice graphics\nInteresting locations\nBetter gameplay than previous game\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n\nStory was corny, but I kind of expected that\n\n\n\nOverall it was a pretty good game.
