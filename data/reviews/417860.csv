It's an okay game. I mean, it's free but VERY short, I completed it in roughly 30 minutes with the rest of the time spent being AFK. What you do does affect what happens more than in games like the Walking Dead which, lets be honest here, does not really bend to your actions as much as this game or other games such as Until Dawn.\nIt's free and can get rather emotional at times so I don't see why you shouldn't try it. It's also very small in size so a very quick download for average internet speeds.

I have complicated feelings about this "game" nonetheless. Yes, the game allows you a brief travel down the memory lane, bringing the early 2000s with references like Muse, Snow Patrol, Greenday, The Ring, Matrix, V for Vendetta and countless others, with one quite sad, yet basic reality of life hanging on the background. But is this a good game? Is it worth your time?\n\nI'd say Emily is Away is a flashback for everyone who's been a teen around the turn of the millennia. During year 2002, you take the role of a teenager just graduating from high school. For the following years, you'll be attending college while trying to keep in touch with your "friend" Emily, chatting with her via AIM. Feeling nostalgic already?\n\nI knew I was the moment I saw Windows XP interface and heard opening sound. I remember my long lost hours chatting with friends and strangers via AIM, ICQ and Windows Messenger, talking about this and that. Combined with pixelated avatars with pop culture references, all felt lovely and accurately reminiscent of the era. With so little in display, we gain quite a lot in atmosphere in this indie game. An idea well thought.\n\nYet, if we are to take a brief glance for the story and the game itself, the realization of the idea carries quite a lot of flaws. It becomes obvious after your second minute to the game that you have a crush on this Emily gal, and it seems that she somewhat returns your feelings. But with always other people in the equation between you two - and some distance thanks to college, you grow apart eventually. The game is built on the shot that everyone has a "lost chance" back from his/her high school years, something you'd ponder now and then: a "what if".\n\nMost reviews out there define this game as a "friendzone simulator". On that definition, they are not completely wrong. It seems there is literally no way for people to come together after that much time and distance getting between them, thus: there is no happy ending for our character and Emily at all. The whole game is weaved around that idea, leaving you with no replay value or anything achievable. Even with the choices given to you, the ending is always the same, with a linear progression and foreclosed alternatives. Whatever you do, or whatever you say, Emily always ends up being away.\n\nYou complete one playthrough in 30 minutes or so, sip some coffee or light up a cigarette and recall your own high school friends, enemies, crush and countless others. Life seemed so static back then, right? As if you'd stay in that exact moment forever, with same songs, movies and friends. Yet, you grow up and times do change. With times changing, everyone do change; even your best friend and the love of your life…\n\nIt all comes down to my starting question: is this game worth your time? Well, there is no definitive yes/no for that. It presented me nothing new or remotely refreshing aside some nostalgic references, but it may feel deep for some people. I'll up vote this one considering that it's a freeware, and you'd have nothing to lose by sparing 30 minutes to appreciate the nostalgia.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 25, 2015","true","1.6"," 215 of 224 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","215","224","6","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/driwamine/recommended/417860/","driwamine","Shuu Iwamine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/driwamine/","150 products in account","This game actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\nNo matter what way you try to put it, Emily is actually emotionally abusive. Like seriously, she guilt trips and gaslights you, both of which are forms of emotional abuse. Yet the game tries to guide you towards appeasing her and acts like she's the one in the right. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that. It makes me feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for doing absolutely nothing wrong.\nGo to the party at the beginning of the game? You get cucked by Brad.\nDon't go, and tell her to not talk to Brad? You get cucked by Travis anyway. Both of whom are jerks to her.\nYou try to get into a relationship and try to be as nice as you can? She acts like you're a complete creeper and wanted nothing more than to have sex with her, she's weirded out by you.\nAct like just a friend? She gets all weird on you asking why you didn't come on to her.\nCall all of her friends out? She just laughs in your face.\nBe a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ back to her? She stops talking to you. And that's what you want. You don't want her to talk to you, because she's a genuinely terrible human being.\nOn top of that, the main character is a ♥♥♥♥ing cucklord and I hate him, he missed his chance of getting with the decent girl because of his dumb obsession with Emily.\nI'm not really for a game that's supposed to have moral choices but you can do nothing but wrong because the character who the choices are aimed towards is an insufferable, volatile ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf your choices meant something, and Emily wasn't a completely horrible person, it'd be a neat concept. I like the whole idea of a visual novel-esque game set on an early IM chat interface. It's a neat idea. But being honest? "dont take it personally babe it just aint your story" did a similar thing and did it better because your choices actually MEANT something. And if you complain about Emily being a more realistic character than anyone in that games, yeah it's true, but is she a likeable character? Is she someone you'd spend several years of your life talking to? I know I wouldnt.","December 6, 2015","false","1.5"," 670 of 790 people (85%) found this review helpful 193 people found this review funny","85","670","790","193","49"

It makes for an interesting playthrough (only 1 though) if you used AOL or MSN when you were younger.\n\nPLAYTHROUGH 1:\n\nI was pretty amazed not going to lie, the game felt almost real to me because I felt like I was having conversations like this when I was younger. Obviously when you're younger you say things without thinking of the meaning, so I played the game in the mind set of going through college and became more harsher as it went on. This pays off because I thought the ending was pretty realistic to my choices. So I tried again this time doing everything I thought Emily wanted to hear:\n\nPLAYTHROUGH 2:\n\nThis is where I started to see a problem, my choices didn't make a difference to the outcome of the ending. Emily still got with Brad, my character is still the beta idiot he was in the other playthrough. I was hoping the game would be different in some way so I played it a final time:\n\nPLAYTHROUGH 3:\n\nI was a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Emily during this playthrough and first major choice is I didn't go to the party in the first year. This changed the story a tiny bit as Emily now dates Travis which is whatever. So I thought this playthrough I would get with Emma. It's going well I get to the final chapter and to my disappointment the ending still didn't change. Even to the point where I thought he would get with Emma, he didn't in the 3 YEARS he could have got with her. He did nothing which generally got me mad because this is meant to be an "interactive story" where none of your choices matter, kinda like the ending of  The Walking Dead	.\n\nEnding\n\nI don't know why the game is like this, there are so many points where it says "Emily will remember this" etc... and the pay off leads to no where. 3 completely different playthroughs lead to the same ending which is disappointing as this could have been an interesting game if any choices mattered.\n\nDo I recommend this game: Yes (it's free) but only for 1 playthrough, don't waste your time playing it again.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThe first playthrough was seriously amazing, it seriously felt like I've had the conversations with a friend in real life so it hit home pretty hard personally but I played again which was probably a mistake. I should have just saved that experience from the first playthrough I had and just turned off the game.","November 20, 2015","true","1.5"," 171 of 178 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","171","178","12","7"

I thought I had it under control, but this game opened that wound...\n\nMy Emily was a friend of mine in Skype... A really good friend.\n\nThat friend allowed me to talk about anything I wanted.\n\nMy insecurities, my problems, my successes, my failures, my joys, my upsets...\n\nAt the start of our relationship, she talked to me a lot, she'd talk to me about her plans and about her future, as well as her problems, which I gladly listened to and was the shoulder for her to cry...\n\nShe told me that she loved me for being there for her, because I really cared about her, I was the voice of reason for her, and sometimes she hated me for being like this, even if it meant the best for her... It was still my opinion, so I always told her it was her choice, anyways...\n\nLater, she didn't have much time to talk to me, since she was having a lot of homework to do, or she needed to take care of her stepsister (which is handicapped, like she told me...).\n\nShe has lied to me before, with some petty stuff, but I always was there to forgive her, I don't have the heart to be mean to anybody, not even to her, even if she did this to me...\n\n"See you, love you"...

Not specifically a bad one.\nMany people may relate to this and feel emotionally attached. Many people won't.\nThe problem with this game is that it doesn't show you backstory of the player and the backstory of Emily. They're friends from what we gather and that's just it.\nEmily then goes on to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boyfriend, dump him, say we should make out, accuse you of wanting to smash, date ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boyfriend again and ditch you.\nThe real emotion in this game comes with deeper thought.\nA lot of the other reviews of this game and from my friend's experiences allow me to see that they feel sad as Emily is gone. She's gone forever and you have no way of talking to her again. Even after you cared for her all of these years. That's the problem. WE shouldn't feel sad. WE shouldn't want Emily to come back. She ditched us after all we've done and she should feel bad for doing so.\nYeah, she's gone and we can't speak to her.\nYeah, all those years have gone by.\nHOWEVER, when she grows older, she will feel remember us and remember how her boyfriend hurt her and she we be sad.\nOnly then can we speak to her again; and by this time, things would have changed.\n\nTLDR/CONCLUSION;\n\nThis game is interesting. It may come as a sudden shock for people but over time, things will get better. There is a glitter of hope in the end of this game, just as there is one in your life. Yes, I mean you - the reader. If you feel as if you can relate to this game in any way, things will get better.

It's very relatable. That's the main theme. No matter what choice you make, regardless if you're the nice guy or guy who always chooses the alternate situation, Emily will always reject you.\n\nEverything about the game, from the Windows XP user-interface, the "Bliss" wallpaper, the startup and shut down chimes, bootup noises, profile pictures, and smaller details such as mentioning "Snow Patrol" and Coldplay. It's as if the developer took a time machine back to the early 2000s and captured every small detail about chat rooms and IM clients. It's a small slice of how things were back then.\n\nIt's free to play, so there's no reason why you shouldn't play, but be warned: it's really sad.

We tried everything. We built up her confidence. We picked her up when she fell down. We lifted her spirits. We were, at least I thought we were, soulmates....\n\n....\n\nI have never been more wrong.\n\nEmily, is without a doubt, the most pathetic and cruel human on the planet. No matter what we did, and no matter what we said, somehow, in Emily's mind, we took advantage of her, even though she is quoted as saying she doesn't regret ANYTHING, nor would take ANYTHING back, we still become the bad guy,..\n\nHOW IS THAT FAIR?!?!?!?!\n\nWe tried to rescue her, from an emotionally and possibly physically abusive relationship, with epic toolbag BRAD. Then when she finally comes to her senses and leaves him, she visits us. And that is where it all goes wrong.... NO MATTER WHAT WE DO!\n\nThen, in her delusional mind, she is rescued by EPIC TOOLBAG....BRAD. She treats like a villain, and proclaims BRAD to be the HERO....pshhh. What a load of crap!!!!\n\nWe are given NO free will, to truly speak our mind, to let her know how we truly feel about her (aka: WE LOVE HER), and absolutely NO option to win her back. Why give us options to say something, only to take them away, right before our eyes! That is cruelty. We worked up the courage to say it, before a robot from the Matrix came and erased our answers and replaced them with awkward small-talk, made by strangers. This is not even an accurate represenation of real life. You have heartache, but you never give up. You get turned down, but you keep trying, and fighting, and no robot EVER really comes to erase, and then replace your answers.\n\nAll in all, it was fun and interesting, and did bring back memories, and left me nostalgic for times past... BUT it left me wanting more. Much, much more. More freedom is needed to make this game more realistic, so that we are at least left with the impression that we can win Emily back. Or at least that we are given the option ourselves to turn down Emily, because quite frankly, she is the worst by the end of the game!\n\nBye.\n\nKate is away","November 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 192 of 233 people (82%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","82","192","233","87","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/417860/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Emily is Away is a visual novel game developed by a single developer, Kyle Seeley. The game was released for free in November 2015 and uses the popular visual novel game engine, Ren’Py.\n\nThe game takes place in a classic MSN chat window, with your friend, Emily. Gameplay is very simple. You are offered a selection of responses as to what you type to Emily and she will respond accordingly. This is done in such a way that you actually have type out on your keyboard (you can also type out complete garbage and the game will still type out your response.) I wish I could type as fast as you do in this game…especially back in those days.\n\nThere isn’t much to say about the graphics, you are simply just sat in front of a Windows XP computer and your UI is the computer screen. It is clean and easy to navigate outside of the chat window.  You can check out other character’s MSN profiles, and see their good ol song lyrics that they have on there…but sadly you cannot communicate with them. I would of personally liked to have seen that as a feature, especially with the other characters which are key to the plot.\n\nEmily is Away has a story which is somewhat interesting, if anyone has ever had some sort of “one that got away” relationship with someone, this may strike a familiar tale with you. Personally I found it to be somewhat cringy in the way it plays out and the character Emily, comes across as someone who I wouldn’t want to associate with, but I given that  it gave me such strong feelings towards her, it means it is a well fleshed out character though. The story can be a little frustrating at times, since you only have three dialogue options at each interval, your feelings can not always be portrayed in the manner in which you want them to, which funnels your responses into three categories, one being pleasant, secondly being an on the fence response, or finally a blunt/unkind response, mainly you have one of these generic choices to make. The story does have a few elements that can change each time you play it, I played it through about six times and always saw something a bit different every time.  Without wanting to spoil too much, there is only one effective ending to the game, the way you get there can differ, but the outcome is always the same.\n\nThe audio in Emily is Away has very satisfying sound effects, the key strokes from typing come from that glorious sound of a mechanical keyboard, to Windows XP bootup/shutdown theme. There is no sound track, but you could always load up some Coldplay and get in the zone of your inner teenager from 2000 if you wanted….\n\nA single play through the story will take you roughly 15-20minutes, the game is split into six chapters spread out over six years. This is a short game, but given that it has a couple of different storylines you can explore via different options and choices, you can easily get about ninty minutes play out this if you wanted.\n\nTechnically Emily is Away is problem free. Obviously you are going to be wanting to play on a keyboard given that it is set in a chat client, and the game can run on a potato if you wanted it to.\n\nTo sum up, now the game is Free to play, I can recommend people try it out, it’s a short enough game that you aren’t really going to miss those twenty minutes if you don’t enjoy it.  Visual novel fans will definitely enjoy it, and like I said above, a certain group of people will certainly want to check it out if they have ever found themselves on the wrong side of the friendzone.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/K60WoB_Q19U\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Then she gets mad at you for not making a move on her, yet she hooks up with some other person that night. When she wants to come visit, she wants to "hang out" but whatever you do, you hook up with her. Wanna go to the movies? Ends with hookup. Hang out around campus? Plan on getting her to hook up with you. No matter WHAT you do, she basically says "I thought you were there for me, guess not".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MajorNoobOwnage/recommended/417860/","MajorNoobOwnage","YouGotOwned","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MajorNoobOwnage/","216 products in account","This game is excellent.\n\nEach and every one of us can vividly recall someone who at one point meant everything to us, but is now just a distant memory. Emily is Away recounts the tale of a young man who is transitioning beyond high school and moving onwards into college life. He feels a multitude of emotions - excitement about moving off to a brand new place and learning new things, happiness about getting into the school he desired and being able to start an awesome new adventure in his life, and lastly, a small, neverending tinge of sorrow deep within his heart when he thinks back to his former best friend from high school, Emily.\n\nThe game encompasses 5 years of this person's life, quintessentially, his entire college experience. As time progresses, people change. People move in and out of each other's lives every day. Someone you may have spoken to every day back in high school may be a distant memory now. In this game, you play the role of the young man described earlier and engage in multiple AIM-like chat conversations with your old friend Emily. These conversations are intermittent between each year, meaning that a lot of time passes in between each one, and therefore, both you and/or Emily may have changed a little during the time prior. This can be seen in the alterations in Emily's biography on the chat interface and her profile picture changes, as well as the stories she tells throughout the conversation while you catch up with one another's busy lives.\n\nI won't get into too many details and will try to avoid spoiling anything for you, but I must say that the game does an excellent job of portraying the young and naive communications between a boy and a girl who may or may not have intertwined feelings for one another hidden within each keystroke. Whether or not this is the case is up to you and Emily. The dialogue choices you make throughout the game will effect what you learn throughout its course. I emphasize the word "learn" in this case because just like in real life, there may be thoughts or feelings that this person on the other side of the screen feels towards you which are not made clear - perhaps because you never ask them, or perhaps because they are too scared to tell you. Whether you seek to learn Emily's feelings about you or not is your choice. Every sentence spoken by both Emily and me felt like it was substantial and had some sort of consequence on our relationship (not a romantic relationship, just that between two people), and that is one of the many things that I just loved about this game.\n\nEmily is Away is an impeccable embodiment of the human condition. Each of us has a special person like Emily in our life, someone who will remain in our thoughts and memories long after they have travelled hundreds or thousands of miles away. Someone who means a lot to you at this short moment in time always will. No matter how far apart you become from someone, your feelings of affection, respect, and love will always remain deep within your soul. Nevertheless, in reality, things do not always work out perfectly - and that's just how life is.\n\nThis game presented its message in a clear, precise, and stimulating manner, and I must say, every moment of it was great. I believe it took me around 30 minutes to complete it, and every single second was worth it. If you are looking for an exciting action game where you get to blow a ton of ♥♥♥♥ up and kill hundreds of terrorists, this is not the right game for you. But if you are looking for an intriguing, nostalgic, and intellectually stimulating experience which you will almost certainly be able to relate to and remember for quite some time, then you should try this game out.\n\nAll in all, this game is absolutely incredible. I highly recommend that you set aside a half hour of your weekend to enjoy this masterpiece and appreciate its wonderful story, message, and all the 00's nostalgia.\n\nFinal Rating: 10/10\n\nEDIT: I spelled school wrong. Oops.","November 21, 2015","true","0.5"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","66","70","3","10"

Every ending is you and the character you talk to "emerly35" slowly drifting apart from WHATEVER action took place in chapter 4. There is no possible way to change it. There are also three different options you can pick and I've found that in most cases she'll respond by talking about the same things.\n\nYou can't change what happens no matter what you do, just sit back and watch it live out with your character who can't seem to wind up with his crush no matter WHAT you have him do.\n\nNow don't get me wrong. "Sometimes things aren't meant to be." Is a fine final message. However, I feel this game lies about it's true gameplay. You can't call it branching if every branch comes back and reforms into the same ending. I played through it twice and having the same ending happen no matter what different options I chose took away from the inpact of the meaning in the story. The fact people are saying that it's replayable is how I know they haven't replayed it. If you're going to play this game that's fine, just don't replay it as it makes the entire experience feel cheap.","November 20, 2015","false","1.2"," 150 of 203 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","150","203","8","2"

It felt really nostalgic and real to me. Then I played it again, to see if there was any other ending like the game made it out to be but ended up getting the same ending. I played it over and over again, maybe 7 times, just to get an outcome that didn't ♥♥♥♥ me off. In the end, I stopped feeling bad for the guy, I started hating Emily, and everything about the storyline. The narrator was one of those dudes that cries about the friendzone, which is just pathetic, and the girl he's obsessed with is just an annoying hypocritical ♥♥♥♥. If this game had choices that ACTUALLY mattered, I'd recommend this, but I'm not recommending a game with crap characters and a man who feels sorry for himself because he decided to waste his time on a girl that is obviously selfish. Overall, the game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off and if you want to play a game only to finish it feeling terrible in every single way, then this is definitely the game for you.","November 23, 2015","false","3.0"," 73 of 87 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","73","87","10","0"

I decided not to go to the party, so she wouldn't end up with that abusive prat Brad. She ends up with Travis instead, who also happens to be an abusive prat. No matter what choices I made, the story went in pretty much the same direction as the first time I played through it. It also finally kicked in to how emotionally manipulative Emily really is.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot reccomend this game. The Steam description claims that your choices determine the outcome of the story, but the outcome is always the same no matter what choices you make. When I thought that my choices mattered, I found the game much more enjoyable, but now it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n(Also, for the record, using trademarked/copyrighted material in your game is a good way to get sued.

Expect a few cringes, laughter and tears along the way. (Plus wanting to punch someone named Brad.) The game also includes 20 easy achievements including many pop culture references. A great game if you have an hour to spare.\n\nReview:  Emily is Away  is set in the era of 2000, where emotions were high and people put angsty lyrics in their IM profiles. You're an art major who spends the course of the game speaking to Emily, an old high school friend. Throughout the game you are presented with 3 choices to choose from that determines the direction of the story. A few nice touches to the game is when you select a choice, for example, it will start to type out "Do you miss us?" but then change it to "Any good music lately?". Also if you click on your friends tab (in-game) you will see some of your steam friends there, complete with an amusing description for them.\n\nTo sum it up, it's best to just play the game as it is hard to review it without spoiling anything. The achievements will most likely take you 40 minutes to complete. Also cards have been added to the game, however you will not get card drops for playing.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","May 1","true","0.9"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","93","51","55","15","0"

You can either go to a party with her or, if you're dumb, you can stay home. After going to the party to hook up with her, time skips and know you're in college. Over the college years, you find out you had the chance to kiss Emily at the party but you didn't you dumb ballsack, so now she's all alone. Except she's wanting to visit! So you let her visit because you're not that dumb, but you find out later she wanted something to happen then, but your lazy ♥♥♥ still didn't do anything! Later, close to college gradutation, you talk for the last time, as everything meaningful you attempt to say gets deleted and changed into boring questions about the weather (an actual question that pops up). Eventually you have to say goodbye and the game ends.\n\nThe game acts like your choices have impact later in the story, but not really. I said coldplay was ♥♥♥♥ on my second playthrough, and so she doesn't start a conversation about music in the next chapter. Woo. A small conversation that had no impact on the plot was changed because I called her favorite band (at the time) ♥♥♥♥. The plot stays the same no matter what minor conversation you have.\n\nThe plot itself is a bit on the lame side. This chick Emily totally wants you, but she goes out with some tool named Brad twice in the story, then whenever you get the chance to do something, the protagonist (offscreen by the way) ruins everything. You both want each other, and you both know you want each other, but you can't bring yourself to ♥♥♥♥ her. The plot is a sad story aimed to make people who fail in relationships think about themselves, and while I fail at relationships constantly, I can't seem to like this story. I know why my relationships fail, because I'm not dumb (if you want to know, message me your life story, and I'll get back to you). I don't want a romance story telling me I failed again, I want one telling me it's going to be okay, with a happy ending that doesn't paint me as a dumbass. If I end up making a game like this (totally possible) I will probably put it on GameJolt or Steam so everyone can feel good about themselves.\n\nI suppose I should talk about the "gameplay," which is choosing an option and typing it. I mentioned already why the choices are bad, so I won't do that again, but the typing is probably one of the only cool things in this game. You pick a choice, then you mash the keyboard and predetermined words show up. I would have liked it better if I could have made than an option instead of the default, but oh well.\n\nAlso there are no options. I wanted to turn the volume down because it felt a bit loud and my ears are a bit sensitive, but there's no options menu.\n\nThis game is barely worth the 56mb it takes on my hard drive. I would rather fill up that 56mb with low resolution porn, because it would be actually worth my time.","November 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 93 of 121 people (77%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","77","93","121","32","7"

A time of .GIF filled websites, AltaVista and America Online or AOL as it was more commonly known. Back then everything was big and proud and come 2001 it all got bigger and prouder as Windows XP hit us squarely in the jaw with its big blue windows and incredible OS power. It was around this time that AIM, AOL’s Instant Messenger service was at its biggest. We all had an AIM username and like mobiles today we all sat there furiously typing away to friends and workmates over our monitors. We made relationships and we broke hearts, we arranged meets and gaming sessions. AIM was king.\n\nTo do this you have conversations with Emily about various aspects of yours and her life, from music to video games, movies to social anxieties and more. The game is a simple one to play. Emily pops up in AIM and says hello, which leads you to a multiple choice of answers. By picking your answer you then ‘converse’ to Emily by pressing random keys on your keyboard. It may sound overly simple and even dull but rest assured, it is not. It feels like you are having a conversation with a real person and in this the developer, Kyle Seeley, really must be praised. Emily will annoy, tempt, tease and laugh along with you for all of its 45 minutes average gameplay per session.\n\nEmily feels so real that at the end of my second playthrough I was desperate to make her fall in love with me but by the end of the fifth I was content to insult her and be as cold as a person in love can be to the other that constantly scorns her/him no matter how hard he/she tries! Come my sixth attempt I just wanted to be loved by anyone and was quite relieved and happy to know that it was all just a game.\n\nEmily Is Away is a game that pushes buttons, your own emotional ones and for something consisting of basic text and very little else it does a surprisingly good job of it. Sure, it may not work for everyone but anyone out there that enjoys interactive fiction, choice and consequence this will no doubt bring more than one emotion to the fore once you really get into the game and determine your goal.\n\nMultiple paths exist so one session is unlikely to feel like the last or next one but you will probably find that five or six attempts is enough to have seen most of it. This is not a bad thing though as those five or six attempts will likely take up to three hours or more of your time and for a game that has no set price you cannot ask for much more.\n\nWithout giving away spoilers it really is quite hard to explain the things you will come across when playing and so this will, like the game itself, be a short but hopefully fulfilling review of a beautiful little title that everyone really should experience at least once.","December 11, 2015","true","1.9"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","47","53","4","8"

You question your life over and over and over again. This game made me feel some kind of way. How I was always there for Emily and she didn't even seem to care. Her profile was always sad and deppressing quotes, how she wanted to be better and forget the past, but she just kept on doing the same horrible ♥♥♥♥ she did to get messed up in the first place. If you do decide to go the "nice guy" route you'll just end up dissapointed. In the 25 minutes of my gameplay I even started to care for Emily, she visited campus, we hook up, and then, she goes back with Brad. It did make me feel upset, because I would have treated Emily the way she deserved to be treated, but I never had the courage to tell her how I felt. The year of graduation we talked, but I just couldn't seem to tell her what I felt, so I just left it at a goodbye.\n\n10/10 Would cry for Emily again","November 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","40","43","4","0"

The medium actually enhances the story, since you get to see everything your character types, whether it's actually sent or not. What you DON'T say sometimes provides more insight than what you do, which I find to be a cool addition. I also like how the various user profiles change as the years go on. Both of these features give a fair bit of life to what could otherwise have just been bland chatlog reading.\n\nMy only problem is that you're required to press keys to type out your character's messages, and it slows the game down a bit, especially when a message turns out to be much longer to type than its choice description would imply. Other than that, I find this game to be worth a play or two, especially with the multiple endings it provides. If nothing else, it's at least free, so I'd say go for it.","November 20, 2015","true","1.2"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","40","44","4","3"

Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ontgiveafuck/","160 products in account","So, let's talk about choices.\n\nIt's always nice to have options open. You got two pens, black and blue. You have two roads, one longer, one shorter. You have two types of pizza you can eat. It really is nice to have those options open in case maybe one day you feel like writing in blue ink instead of black; just in case you wanna take the scenic route; just in case you don't like plain cheese pizza (the hell is wrong with you?)\n\nThat being said, this game gives you the "illusion" of choice. Personally, I was expecting my actions to be as "middle-of-the-road" as possible, basically being that reliable, chaste friend. Next thing I know, Emily is complaining about how "everything was planned", such as having her hang out with me and a few friends and her coming back to my dorm.\n\nThing is, I never said she could. The game says that's what happens, and that's what you're going to have to deal with.\n\nEmily is Away has potential, it truly does. But when I want to ask a question, a serious question, mind, my character backspaces and just goes with something middle of the road. Like, no. You don't force a player into a very serious situation, then suddenly make everything quaint again. That's not how you go about this sort of thing. If there were more repercussions, paths to follow, and, y'know, NOT THE ♥♥♥♥ING DORM SCENARIO, Emily is Away might actually be a decent idea. But as it stands currently, it's a game that has you play as someone else, regardless of who you wanna be when you "sign in"\n\nAlso, $10 for some new skins? What are you, Overkill?

I didn't care for Emily.  I really didn't.  I just knew that she was a friend so I treated her like one.  But the game essentially went "no you love her" and made every option practically revovle around that.  I think the only person I cared for was Emma and Mike took her away without giving me a choice in the matter.  This game made the choices for me, but at the same time, I can kind of appreciate the beauty of it all as well.\n\nNo matter what you do differently the results will still end up being the same and things just aren't meant to be.  I do appreciate the message behind the game but just some in game executions were just kind of frustrating.  Like my first playthrough I showed no romantic interest in Emily through my dialogue options and did absolutely nothing to try to take advantage of her and then "the year passes" and it's like "why did you take advantage of me when I was vulnerable" like I had no choice.\n\nI could also be frustrated at this game becuase I feel like all of the same things happened to me in real life as well.

Either way, it does it really badly.\n\nI guess I'll start with positives. The sounds remind me of nostalgic times when 32-bit systems were still plenty and the Internet still relied on things like America Online. This plays into the UI which was a very clever concept. The typing idea was fun at first, but kinda gets repetitive later on. This is a negative too, because you "type" all this stuff for no changes!\n\n...Which brings me to the cons...\n\nFirst, let's talk about paths. In a game where each response has three options each time the endings are incredibly linear to the point where the options shouldn't matter. It's like I'm just reading a story! And don't get me wrong, there's nothing bad about a game just being a big story. In fact, one of my favorite games is just that! (ahem, ahem)\n\nSo what's up? Why does this game bother me?\n\nOne word: Outcome. There's no change to it at all!\n\nThis is all spoilers so I guess I'll tag them as such (stupid extra work).\n\nNo matter what you do, you always try to end up with Emily (No matter how bland her personality is). Or to be more precise, the game does.\n\nYou guys have similar interests and you show your infatuation? She asks why you don't kiss her. This also happens if you remark on her terrible (it's terrible) taste in music.\n\nYou try everything or nothing, she ends up with Brad. BUT you can get her to ditch Brad, in which case she ends up with Travis... Who apparently is exactly like Brad??? Despite Travis actually having interests that aren't just xXEDGEMASTER420Xx and having actual depth of character? Like really, what happened with Travis' father? The more time that passes, the more it seems to eat away at him!\n\nNo matter what, Emily finds something weird about the planned get together. If you are just friends and you want it to be that way, she asks if you felt something more and she says it's weird now EVEN WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE JUST HELPING HER AS A FRIEND. I think Freud would want to ask her about a cigar. If you end up having her visit and get drunk, you hook up with her and she thinks it's all planned, which probably is her projecting because she tried to get you to kiss her at Travis' party anyway. But anyway, she finds the situation weird so o well  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. If you tell her it wouldn't be good because of Emma (or just in general), she pushes you and if you say no, then the relationship is weird again! Speaking of Emma...\n\nEmma never dates you. And for some reason, that's a problem even if you weren't romantically involved at all? It makes no sense.\n\nEmily always ends back with the other person because "they care about each other". Any sane person would see the abusive relationship but nah man. You ain't friends so why tell her that.\n\nThat last bullet is the core of the issue here: You aren't friends. Not in the slightest. So why can't you actively change the outcome? This is trying too hard to be like Hate+ with this\nforced plotpoint. But instead of it feeling like a dream deferred, it feels repetitive. You can't even break away from it. You can't be like "Emily, you are a mess and need to figure ♥♥♥♥ out. This is not a you and me problem, this is a you problem." You always try to be some timid guy who can't do anything in the end. Even when you basically tell her that you aren't a mind reader, she still thinks you are. There was no progression from the characters at all, and it was annoying. At one point I was trying to get my character to REALLY HIT HER HARD with how she doesn't learn from her mistakes but the best you can do is just be a jerk and have her "not want to talk to you right now" which is hilarious because it shows that she still wants to be friends despite how mean you can be. It's asinine. I mean, if she progressed to being a worse character it would actually be something. Now some people will think that "oh, but that's how she is, and the fact that you are getting upset shows that the game did it's job!" And I say, "nah, ♥♥♥♥ off." Because, no really. Sure, you don't have control over her, but you have control over yourself. This game kinda builds off the premise that Emily is the focus. Okay, sure. So then why can't my character change so the focus of Emily is seen from a different set of eyes? And that change could be either: A different actual character, or my character changing his goals from "EMILY ALL THE TIME" to like "Oh man, College." or "Oh man, Emma." and not have it be just some minor side plot? It would help to get some other kind of non-railroaded perspective.\n\ntl;dr: I wasted time on this game, so I wrote a review to vent. Play for nostalgia and JOOOOOHN CENAAAAAA and then proceed to give it a hard pass and uninstall. I'm going to bed.","December 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","19","19","3","0"

However, it's here where I think the game has it wrong.\n\nIn short, no matter what you do, what you say, Emily will always be out of arms reach. You can never be with this girl, and no matter how hard you try, how much you change, it will never happen. This is where I disagree. Of course a girl like this has been in many peoples lives. But for the most part, I don't think this should happen. Never ever.\n\nThis cat and mouse game should not happen to you, it either makes it or breaks it. And you control how that plays out. You can be head over heels in love with this girl, but there's a point in your life where you either tell her you love her, or sever the head and leave it to die (Figuratively, I'm not telling you to kill someone you can't hook up with. I don't need a felony on my hands.)[/] But the way this game forces you to avoid the topics mentioned above, in my opinion, preaches the wrong message.

The "gameplay" is minimal since there are only dialogue choices to play around with and there is no deep story behind it all, although some people might feel, subjectively, emotional by the end depending on what ending they get. An alternative name such as "Friendzone Simulator" would have still been appropriate.\n\nHardly a game, per se, but it is very short (30 minutes?) and most importantly free.

Unfortunately, it struck a nerve that I've been having with games generally lately, and that's the false sense of choice that so many games have these days. When your game is a visual novel, when you're not selling it on graphics or gameplay but on the story told and the way you as a player can affect that story, then to have a game where your actions have no effect whatsoever is simply ridiculous.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand the point they were trying to make, and I even agree with it (namely that  there are some people in your life who in spite of everything you do you'll never be able to have a relationship with just because the circumstances don't work out right). But creating that scenario in such an artificial way, by removing any real agency from the player, is pointless. The most obvious example for me was the fact that you can't choose to kiss Emily at the party. You can't sell me a game on it being an interactive experience where I make the choices about the story and then turn around and say 'oh but that choice would ruin my beautiful, carefully crafted story, so you don't get to make that one'. That's when it stops feeling like a story game and starts feeling like the creator couldn't get their novel published so they made a game instead.\n\nI thought the story was OK and  I liked the old school design, and if not for the problem with the endings I might have made this a recommendation (I'd even have been happy if there were multiple endings that were essentially the same but took into account the choices made earlier in the game somehow). But as it is, it's not a game, just a story, and there are plenty of better stories than this out there. Seeing the same people who criticised Mass Effect for the way it ended praise this game is bizarre to me. Thumbs down.\n\ntl;dr 10/10 Emily remembered that I didn't like Coldplay.","December 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","1"

I honestly have no idea what even happened between me and Emily. Apparently something happened, but because the exposition is entirely through dialogue I never found out. The dialogue eventually becomes so limited and clunky that the only emotion I felt was frustration with the writer. I'm not sure whether or not this game is trying to sell me some sort of social message or something but the only lessons I got out of it were:\n\n1) Capitalization is important and you look like an idiot without it.\n2) Social skills are important and you look like an idiot without them.\n3) Exposition in storytelling is important and you look like an idiot without it.\n\nEmily seems to suffer from what I call "High School Sophomore Syndrome" where not only is she unable to express her emotions, but she is also unable to express if she even has an emotion. But don't worry this can be easily treated by actually being able to talk to someone. See most people are under the illusion that you are the socially awkward character in this game. They're wrong. You AND Emily are the socially awkward ones. Now past this point I'll be talking about spoilers for whatever it is you call this.\n\nAlright spoiler time.\n\n"NONE OF YOUR CHOICES MATTER AND YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY" is what this game politely screams in your ear. The problem this story throws at you is that you apparently have sex with Emily. No matter what you choose this happens. But the probem is that the very minimalist gameplay is used as a means of exposition. So afterwards you have no idea if the problem is that there was consent involved  or that she is just very confused about how she should feel about it. So I'm going to guess that it was the former of these two (since this game is trying to give a message). The problem is it wants you to feel bad for Emiy after this. So you do. The problem is that you are the defendant in this situation and you honestly end up having no idea what's going on if you choose to feel sorry the dialogue is so extremly wishy-washy that you have no idea what actually happened at all. It doesn't help that Emily also has no idea what happened either. Which in any other situation would convey that she herself is emotionally vulnerable and confused. But somehow this game just made it seem like she instead didn't know how to feel about hooking up with one of her friends. Which is an understandable and justifiable feeling. Except when one of the main characters has no idea what happened and the other one has the emotional comprehension of a sixth grader--and you are completely unable to tell which one of the characters is which. And when dealing with a topic like this its good to make the player attached to at least one of the main characters. Except by the time a game would have normally done that, you've already finished where the emotional confrontation was supposed to be.\n\nOverall, the game's minimalistic gameplay just make the story dance around the subject in a situation where it needs to take a definitive point of view. The dialogue becomes so extremely limiting eventually, where instead of it becoming a hopeless situation in which you (the player/main character) tries as hard as they can to fix an unfixable situation, it instead becomes a hopeless situation in which you (the player) becomes so frustrated with how idiotic you (the main character) are acting that the situation becomes unfixable only because there is literally nothing you (the player) can do to stop yourself (the main character) from acting like the aforementioned sixth grader.","December 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","36","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/417860/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Emily is Away is a short game, where you (re)live the good old time of the instant messaging with icons, with horrible sounds. You play Emily's best friend and for 5 or 6 years, you're going to see this relationship evolve depending on your choices during the discussions. You begin at the end of high school until finishing college.\n\nIf there is something that you should know is that there is no happy ending. Well, I mean, you can be as nice as you, as much as responsible, trying to please Emily and the result will be always the same: she'll call on you. At the end, you can see that life changed you both.\n\nYou can clearly see that your character was crushing on Emily, however, you don't know if she's feeling the same. You don't have any control on outside events, like Travis's party or what happened between you and her during the week-end after she broke up with her boyfriend.\n\nHowever, it's frustrating to try different routes. Each end of the discussion is Emily is away. You tell her that you can miss a group project reunion, a party with your friends, etc.. so that you can listen to her and she's rejecting this offer for example.\n\nThe fact is that Emily is Away is just a game made for nostalgic people. You just press enter to see the text you're writing (even correcting faults) and you choose your answer just before among three proposed. Some of them will not change the course of the discussion, others are important.\n\nThe only real fun thing to do is to try many usernames, to unlock new icons. I would even say that some may be not belonging to this era at all (Portal, Undertale and others). Another funny thing is to look at everyone's profile and remember when you were putting quotes or lyrics everywhere.\n\nBut it's not because it may become boring after a while that Emily is Away isn't worth a shot. It's reflecting life as it can happen, missed opportunities and relationships. It's always interesting to see that and besides, like I've said, it's also for nostalgic people, though I'm not feeling a nostalgia wave.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad at all. It's really well-chosen for what the game will want to do. As for the soundtrack, apart the infamous Windows sound and the ping, you don't have anything.\n\nMy only problem is that the cursor isn't pointing on where you want, I needed to click on the left of a button to manage to play - it has caused me a problem the first time I've played it as I thought it was stuck. I suppose it's a problem due to the a wider monitor than the game can handle.\n\nEmily is Away is a good little game in the end and as it's free, your wallet will not cry for money.","April 20","true","2.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","2"

Because of this I felt no connection with 'Emily' at all.\nYou're given names of people you've not heard of before, and the options towards these people are usually calling them a name or asking emily to treat them badly. Personally I didn't like this feature.\nThis sort of game relies on emotional attachment but the game failed to deliver that.\n\n(Spoilers)\nEmily is Away has no happy endings. Either way, the game will guilt trip you for your decisions. I personally frown upon this in a story-reliant game if it isn't done extremely well.\n(Spoilers)\n\nHowever, I do love the nostalgic aesthetic to the game. It's what made me want to play this game. It really brings back old memories!\nThe way the character and Emily types is very similar to what people of that age would send back then.\n\nThis would be much better with an internet friend or a first time talking scenario, as the user would be building the story as they go along rather than basing everything from a pre-determined story.\nEmily is Away would probably get away with this if it wasn't as short.\n\nOh and the typing gimmick?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicCh33se/recommended/417860/","EpicCh33se","EpicCh33se","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicCh33se/","49 products in account","Emily is Away is an interactive messaging-SIM that tells the story of a highschool/college boy and his best friend: Emily. The game interface replicates a classic Windows feel, along with boot and message sounds. It took me 50 minutes to play through once; some people took a shorter or longer time.\n\nI decided to play this game on a whim, and hey, it was free. I was actually pleasantly surprised that messaging wasn't the only thing you could do. Along with the messaging window, there is a "friend list" kind of thing, where you can check up on your contact's profiles. In every profile is a description written by the user, but most of the time, they are song lyrics.\n\nThe game spans over 5 chapters, with a 1 year interval between them. With each year, the relationship between the two characters will flow as smooth as rocks on an asphalt road can flow. For every year, you can choose a profile picture. This can affect what Emily will say at times. Every time your character will type, you are given three dialogue options, which dictate what he will say (not verbatim). You click/press enter, and then keyboard characters are either typed or deleted with each keystroke, so typing yourself will really have no effect. Choices seem to only affect the ending in miniscule ways, from what I've seen. Sometimes, the boy would type something, only to backspace and type something different. It is truly interesting to see what the main character is thinking but is hesistant to say.\nAs I stated before, each person using the messaging program has a profile, and you can use details on these profiles to help you choose what to say sometimes.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nPersonal Experience\nAs soon as I found out that typing didn't matter, I told myself that I would try to predict what the boy'd say and type along anyway. And you know what? A lot of times, what came up was exactly what I had inputted. Cool.\n\nI had literally no expectations of this game, as I didn't even know it existed until a few hours ago. However, right in the middle of the first chapter, I began to let myself connect. I am just a highschool boy in a similar situation, so perhaps for this reason, the game had more of an impact on me.\n\nA lot of venting, basically my life story (tl;dr down below): the main character obviously has affections for Emily. When these feelings developed or peaked are unknown.\nWhen I was much younger, in second grade, I met a girl. She was much taller than I, and was very pretty. Somehow, we became friends, hey. I was a weird, Asian kid with glasses and horrible teeth, so I didn't know how we became friends. I only found out last year that her mother had wanted her to talk to me more (We were newly moved into our small town, and news gets around fast), to "get into the right crowd."\nIf only she knew what would become of me, haha.\nShe was the daughter of the school's music teacher, and my family had pushed me into the world of music not very long before moving into the town.\nAnyway, I felt an instant attraction. At that time, I decided to stay away a little, just a little. I was uncomfortable with myself. As such, it was around that time that I began fantasizing about things, just surreal, pretty, situations that involved my person of interest.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nTime flew, and it was as if the world wanted us to be the same size proportion.\nIn middle school, we never really talked at all. We were both in Band, but even playing the same instruments as her didn't make me want to talk.\nWe began to talk more in 8th grade, with everday games of Chopsticks in Band. It was then that I felt a sudden resolve inside of me. I would try to redeem myself, to make up for the time lost.\n\nThankfully, I had more classes with her in high school. Again, it was like the world wanted us to be the same heights away from each other. I'm about 5 inches shorter than her.\nAlmost immediately, we talked and conversed a whole lot more. WIth her, it felt like we talked this much on a regular basis for the last decade. We walked home from school every day, which also allowed us to converse more.\nEven though we never talked in middle school, I had gotten the notion that she was very sassy and stubborn. It was one day when we were walking that I noticed how she was much more womanly. Not sassy at all, but still stubborn. However, she was stubborn for the total opposite reasons.\nOf course, I had also changed. I no longer stayed away. Instead, I wanted us to be closer.\n\nIt's a pretty cliche story, now that I look back. I'm still not sure when hindsight will hit me and remind me of how stupid I was and still am, how my current thoughts will probably someday seem childish.\nI still want to make up for the time lost, and even though we've talked so much, I feel as if it's not enough. I do not care if we don't end up in a relationship; I just want to spend as much time with her as possible for now...\nI worry whenever she tells me about her life. It seems like she has feelings for someone else.\n\nAt times, I think to myself how we will turn out in the future. We both want to go to different universities, so I am afraid we will never see each other much, if at all, after high school.\n\ntl;dr I think I'm love with my childhood friend.\n\nPlaying this game gave me a little insight on how a relationship like that could progress/retrogress after separation and attending different schools. Given my life experiences, it really spoke to me. It also didn't help that a lot of the musical lyrics in the messaging profiles were from songs that I know and love (especially those by Death Cab for Cutie).\nEven if choices don't affect the ending much, it affected my experience throughout the game. I felt like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place sometimes, wondering to myself if it really was the right thing to say. The main character changing his mind occasionally hit me hard, seeing Emily's typing patterns evolve from barebone letters to sentences with capitals and punctuation reminded me of my situation, and having the main character be the one to initiate and end the conversation in chapter 5, as opposed to Emily, were all nice touches.\n\nAfter beating the game, I felt insanely crushed. My fears had come true in some alternate video-game world. No, even throughout the whole game, I felt horrible, down, sad, depressed, angry even. Not only was I angry at the other characters like Brad, I was angry at myself for making someone else go through these things, even if it was a video-game character.\n\nI'm still recovering from this game now.\n\nPlay it, please.\n\n1. Goodbye.\n2. Goodbye.\n3. Goodbye.","November 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Emily is Away is a very short narrative game, which takes you back to the good old days of AIM (AOL Instant Messanger). If I were to say that this game succeeds at anything positive at all, it would definitely the nostalgia factor it induces.\n\nThe objective of the game is simple, you chat with your "friend" Emily over AIM chosing from various options of dialog to send in response to Emily's messages to you; The options you chose determine the events that happen in the upcoming chapters in the story, though I have to say, for a game that relies mostly on it's narrative and storyline, there aren't many options to chose from or many different routes to take.\n\nI won't spoil the story or the events for anybody, but if you were an avid user of AIM, MSN, or any other kind of IM Client growing up, this game will likely hit very close to home. I personally have found myself in similar situations in the past, having almost the exact same kind of frustrating "I can't do this" and "I don't want to talk about it" conversations with people whom are no longer a part of my life. The game definitely manages to pull at your emotions, particularly in the last two chapters.\nIt is very difficult to put my thoughts on this into words for a review, but to understand why this game can be somewhat of an emotional experience, you simply have to try it for yourself. I guess the best way to describe it is that the situation feels very real, a lot of you have likely been through something similar to the scenario here in your time.\n\nTo call Emily is Away a "game" is a huge stretch, gameplay itself is extremely minimal and I wouldn't exactly call this a fun experience in any way or form, nor would I call it a bad experience, I do however believe that it's interesting enough for people to consider trying at least once, especially since it's a Free to Play title.\n\nNote: Chose "Yes" over "No" for Recommending on the grounds that it costs you nothing to play and it's definitely an interesting experience, though this game is certainly the definition of a "barely positive review".","November 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","1"

God, I still have that startup themesong stuck in my head. I was quite happy about this game for giving me some nostalgic memories from Windows XP. But yeah, if you haven't played the game it's basically about these two characters that talk to eachother through a messaging program on the computer. It's starts out in 2002 when they're seniors in high school, and then ends off with them about to graduate from College in 2006. This another one of those games where you have to chose what you have to say, and whatever you chose can affect the story in different ways. The whole game isn't anything special or anything, just two individuals talking about what they're doing currently in their lives. But what I do like about the game is that it can often be relatable. Something that the game could've done better in my opinion is maybe make the characters say more interesting things, or create some gossip. Just something to spice up the game a little. But don't expect much since this is only a Free2Play game. Don't get me wrong, I did like the story, but a little simplistic if you want to create a game.\n\nAnother nice feature to the game are the icons. Every year in the game has a different profile picture icon, with things from that year, like 2004 being the year of American Idiot, or 2006 being the year 300 came out. You can also chose what name and screen-name you want which I highly like, because if you write the name Portal, or Isaac, you can chose to have that icon and you'll get an achievement. What made me crack up even more is when Emily actually comments about the icon. My absolute favorite which I recommend you trying is using the screen-name JohnCena. If you chose that, Emily will then ask you who this is, and your character will start saying JOHHHHNNNNN CENNNNAAA with the theme song playing in the background. Absolutely hilarious. Any bugs? Well, yes. If you type your name it will sometimes accidentally switch to the second line and it's really annoying trust me. But in the end, I would the game a thumbs up!","December 18, 2015","true","10.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","1"

The story is well paced and has a pretty damn emotional ending, capturing and making you feel that feeling of helplessly gripping for a friend as they drift away from you.\n\nWell, the first time anyway.\n\nFor tl;dr, I don't reaaaally recommend this game, as only the first time you experience it is good, and even then, only the ending. Everything before and after the ending is kinda dumb and pointless. Although I suppose chapter 1 is for setup.\n\nSee, this is one of those "illusion of choice" games, as in there is only every one ending, but how you get there is different. Which would be fine if how you got there was actually, y'know, not utterly boring and monotonous? The dialogue definitely comes along as well written, with characters feeling pretty real (teenage angst UNGH!) and natural, however, I didn't feel like anything really affected the overall ending as a whole. For example:\n"You chose to go to an art school." What does this do? JACK. You meet Emma (who does nothing) no matter which school you go to.\n"You decided not to go the party." Sure, Brad (who gets Emily if you go to the beforementioned party) doesn't get Emily, but neither do you because TRAVIS IS A ♥♥♥♥. And then Brad and Travis are essentially the same person. Who then proceed to do nothing. Each time it said "Emily will remember this" I always had to ask,\n"sure, but will this actually change anything?"\n\nEmily is Away has a kinda great ending, and if you take the around 20 minutes of your time (which is all this game costs by the way) you could be pleasantly surprised. But everything before and after that ending is boring and meaningless. If you're bored or wanting to dip your feet into VNs, give it a go, but otherwise there are other games/vns you could be playing.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention this, but it's something minor that bothered me on repeat playthroughs. To advance, you have to type. It doesn't have to be the choice you pick, you could type "I love you Emily" but if the choice was "I ♥♥♥♥ rocks" It would still come out as "I ♥♥♥♥ rocks". This I don't mind, but it gets annoying slamming my keyboard randomly after an hour. I wish I could just choose to turn this off, so I could just choose the choice and watch it get auto typed or something.

This game left me rolling my eyes, recognising all the dramatic subtext that I probably used myself at that age. This game also left me feeling dirty  as if Emily was insisting I ♥♥♥♥♥ or took advantage of her, when the entire game I remained aloof and as uninterested as I could be! It made me even more mad, because I felt it was SHE who was being pushy about coming out for the weekend. She was obviously on the rebound.\n\nI don't know, maybe teens will get more appreciation from this game. Maybe even some adults.\n\nThis is just one of the most disatisfying waste of time games I've played to date.

If you just want to be her friend she will go back to her douch*bag boyfriend after a while - she must really love the "d". What a bi***,\n\nI do not recommend playing this, unless you want to "date" a virtual girl (that just wants our di*k) and be bored while doing so.\n\nAlthough the game is free, I am sorry to say that playing this is a waste of your time. There are better free games out there for you to spend time with.\n\nCheers!","November 21, 2015","false","0.7"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","0"

You try being a nice guy, being caring and considerate and honest and what they need when they need it and get them drunk so you take advantage of them in their vulnerable state and bang them, and then Brad comes along and ruins everything.\n\nF*CK YOU, BRAD!\n\nHere they've actually managed to turn instant messaging into a game, and you know what?... It's actually pretty good! Played out over five chapters and five conversations spanning five years during high school and college, shoot the sh*t with Emily online and put your relationship through trials and tribluations of friendship, jealousy, rebounds, hook-ups, awkward aftermaths, consolations and, well... you'll have to play to find out the rest of what's involved.\n\nAs the conversations play out you are given dialogue options. Click on the one you like the look of, hammer random keys on the keyboard to make the message type itself out on the screen, hit Enter, then watch the story unfold. There really is nothing more to the game except to try and make the best of each hand you're being dealt. Just like in real life!\n\nI really don't want to get into any more of it and spoil how things play out, but it is strangely affecting and relatable and, while I can't speak for everyone, I personally found it a little too close to home in hitting its mark. And I guess that will also play a big part in how you feel about the game and whether you like it or not. If the text all rings true to you then it will really impact you. If it all seems totally foreign to you then it will just seem like dumb writing with stupid people making stupid decisions. But sometimes that's actually just what life is really like.\n\nIt's free, it's only about 30-40 minutes to play through, and it's a really touching, true-to-life tale of relationships and people that's totally worth checking out. And if nothing else, I think we can all learn a very important, valuable lesson from it - Brad is a total d*ck.

There are no choices that you can actually make, only the illusion of them; every branch of dialogue reaches a singularity by the next chapter. The choices you make also have varying degrees of power, and lacked consistency. Sometimes it seems like the game wanted you to shape what choices your character had made prior to the game, or outside of the AOL chat, but at other points, when it was convenient to the plot, you had no say in what you did. Sometimes the choices were literally the same thing with a few words changed. The tapping on the keys to type was also very annoying and pointless.","April 15","false","1.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Do you remember how you thought that your crush is your big love and you will love her forever, even tho that you dodn't really know what love means? Maybe you do. Most of people grow up, and see this things in different light, they see how foolish their acts was and they move on. I did, it took me too much time, but I did. Unfortunatelly some sad losers are still dreaming, still hoping that their crush from middle school will be with them, even tho many years have passed. This game is about htis kind of people. I don't know if creator is some kind of sad 'beta boy' but this game is basically simulator of shy, cringy guy that can't get over one specific girl.

They are visually stunning and they engage with you mechanically in a way that is visceral and immediate. Journey, Transistor and Bastion are all games like that for me. Then there are games that excite you conceptually. They are minimal offerings but what they lay bare is so creatively exciting that it brings a smile to your face. This smile persists even while the narrative unfolds in melancholic tones. The experience is one of beauty and sadness as so intrinsically related. Gone Home, Papers Please, and Emily is Away are games that have felt like this for me. Emily is Away brilliantly captures all the ineptitude of adolescent and early adult relationships in a digital age where connection is so easy, but so fragile. From the limited response options, to the fumbling way in which each message is crafted, deleted and recrafted, the game captures the anxious experience of trying to love, be loved, express love, care, whatever. The game is also clever in the way it aligns your expectations as a video game 'player' with the hopes and aspirations of your avatar. You, the player, actually want to win Emily over, because you believe it aligns with some notion of 'winning' in a sense external to the game. I cannot wait to try to win Emily over again and to be heartbroken and reminded of all my past mistakes once more.","November 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

The easter egg achievements can all be done in about 5-10 minutes after completing the main game.\n\nAs for the game itself...\n\nEmily is Away is a text based game revolving around 2 high school friends who try to keep in touch during college. Both have feelings for each other. Stuff happenss, or stuff doesn't happen. No matter how you play the game, the ending pretty much remains the same. It actually has a cool premise, as the game is played out entirely in instant messaging. It's a very brief game, and there is nothing much to do other than to read what Emily types, and progress the game with one of 3 choices at every response. Do the choices really matter? Well, not so much. It changes the flow of everything, except the ending. Not to say there is not just 1 ending. There is more than 1 ending. But the ending is usually always going to be... Well.

When talking with Emily, you are given a variety of choices to respond and react with, which are either positive, negative, or neutral; these responses will shape future interactions with Emily throughout the game. Spoiler: there is currently no known “happy” ending for you & Emily. Generally, it always ends in “goodbye”.\n\nUnlike similar games, which are simply “click to proceed”, “Emily is Away” continues to indulge players with a nostalgic and realistic experience by requiring you to “type” (or pretend to type) your selected responses. This aspect, as well as those mentioned below, truly heighten the experience.\n\nIn addition to its story, the game offers fun little features such as changing your font during chat with a variety of possible combinations, viewing your friends’ profiles, and changing your own profile icon! Perhaps the most enjoyable features are the latter two, which appropriately and humorously allude to that year’s most stereotypical messages, likes, and fandoms. For an added comedic experience, I highly recommend examining all of your friends’ profiles and watching them as they change throughout the years; I promise you will not be disappointed!\n\nTL;DR\n“Emily is Away” is an enjoyable game worth playing if you have ~30 minutes to spare and want a nostalgic experience or if you want free achievements.","May 3","true","0.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Nope, as Emily does one thing very well: Making you want to experience every dialogue option to see the answers and different small talks you'll get in response.\n\nIt does fail as a story as it has a start and (an EXCELLENT) build up.... but SEVERELY lacks as an end. It just... ends. Yes, it's impressive how you get to CARE about characters that don't exist and most: do not even talk (game's just a chat window, literally).\n\nBut none of it goes ♥♥♥♥ing anywhere!\n\nApparently there are 2 endings: Mine was  Emily ends up going back to the boyfriend she broke up with 2 chapters or so ago. A boyfriend that had one hell of a temper and didn't hit her because her guardian angel was amazing! Both you and Emily end up talking occasionally after high school as the story happens during college and the tension between you and Emily is not only ridiculously cliché but the fact that by the end it's CRIMINALLY linear completely kills the atmosphere of a tense story I was so excited for. Until the last chapter I was loving the game, and then... ♥♥♥♥ starts getting talked about and I pick an option, as my character DELETES MY DIALOGUE and WRITES A NEW, LAME AND 1-WORDED DIALOGUE like "Goodbye", "I dunno".\n\nThe chance of a real "relationship" with this virtual character/setting the mood for a great emotional story is completely skull ♥♥♥♥ed by this as every choice I make is quickly deleted and replaced with something that is answered for the sake of the ending being "always bad". All stories can end well.\n\nNot this one!\n\nAny questions of the story, just ask me, but overall I thought the ending (while realistic (then again, other realistic endings could've happened)) was rushed and literally went nowhere. Just a story of a  missed chance at love that generated a weird relation between 2 friends of the opposite sex that ended their friendship by the end of college\n\nAnd as I do not see my choices mattering at all to the course of the story, I cannot even care for the second ending as I also don't see it being any conclusive.\n\nOther Stuff and Overall ~\nA good game? Yes. Totally worth a playthrough and an achievement run as I got it 100% in like 40 minutes. The game itself can be completed in 25-30 minutes. It's charming, interesting and quite well done.\n\nIt just lacks more branching paths that would allow for a good ending that cannot happen because sometimes your choices are replaced by others totally different (Didn't people complain about that in Fallout 4? This did even worse and get's nearly praised its ♥♥♥ off!), ending in a forced note that left a very sour taste in my mouth that I had to wash with proper dialogue options in an RPG.\n\nIt's a free-to-play 60 Mb game. Definately worth a run. I sincerely hope for a sequel or a similar game but that allows for your choices to matter instead of this.\n\nA rock solid 7/10. Hit the sweet spot on everything but the ending which killed the experience for me.","March 20","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Decisions you make do not matter, schools you choose do not matter. basically anything you DECIDE to do doesnt matter beacuse the next chapter you do has the same basic plots. You know its game over before its game over, and that ruins the fun. there is not a single way to WIN this game.\nwithout spoiling to much of the game, dont think this game is a dating sim, dont think for a second that Emily and [PLAYER] wind up together in a happy-go-lucky relationship.\n\nif by reading this review spoils anything or prevents you from downloading it, then sorry, but this game is a 1 play through game. Trust me, there are no alternate endings. you got what everyone else gets..\n\n\nif by chance in the last chapter you manage to get Emily to sign off before you, (which can be done, its not hard)\n\ni would personally consider that the best win possible\n\n\n\nif your looking for a quick nostaligic game (that actually DID accurately portray what i was like during those years) than i suppose this game is for you\n\n\n\nin terms of everything else, i would NOT recommend.\n\n\nand to the developer\n\nEmily is Away had potential to be an actually very fun game. I know that this game was probably made with a little hard work and time, and for that I give you kudos\n\n\nI know how difficult coding games are, beleive me I do\nI know that making alternate choices and paths are not the easiest thing in the world, as it requires more time and code.\n\nbut i also know that if you DID choose to make it more open ended, or have alternative choices, maybe even 3 more, then i would have probabaly had something better to say about it.\n\nI know my one review means little to nothing but i just dont want other players to get the wrong impression about the game\n\n\nKyle Seeley, im sorry if this story (or something similar) happened to you in person. It happens. I know all to well what it was like back then, trying to express feelings to someone, and trying to maintain contact when two peoples lives are so busy and seperated. I hope that if something like this DID happen, that you have found someone to enjoy your life with who is ALOT better than Emily ever could be.\n\n\nThanks for reading\n\nTL:DR\n\nMessenger Game that makes you want to shoot the Messenger","May 17","false","1.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","5"

A good and bad ending should have been implimented, maybe not full hate or full love, but at least one that lets you keep in touch or one where she is very hurt and decideds to end the friendship herself, something to make it seem worthwhile and give each choice some heft.\n\nFull Review:\n\nThe Premise of EiA is that you live the life of a boy who is friends with Emily, and the two of you interact with an interesting story crossing a 5 year span from 2002-2006 where you both grow up trying to stay in contact, but ultimately failing by the end. The idea is the whole "its not the destination, but the journey" type of concept, and while it seems good on paper, the end result feels... unfufilling. Its one of those instances where one might stand there and wonder to one's self "What was the honest point? Sure its fun but after the first run or 2... eh."\nThe meat of the game comes in the journey as you, the player, talk to emily on good ole' AOL in Windows XP. As you go through your lives you talk about what is happening between each other, console each other, and try to continue your friendship as you grow ever more distant, all hitting a climax in '04 where, to prevent spoiling, things happen and Emily becomes distant from you in some way, depending on the thing, and eventually you can trade small talk in '06 before YOU are away (Deep I know *sliiiight sarcasm*)\nWhat the game loses me on is the buildup to one big *PFFT* of nothing. After that one sad moment, another runthrough shows... drumroll... NOTHING NEW. Sure there are varients but its always the same goodbye emily, you are no longer friends because reasons.\nIt really kills the potential for replayability; but more importantly this lack of branch endings leaves a sour taste to the pallets of those looking for at least some semblance of choice, or even deeper meanings in the lack there of. Sure the game doesn't need the whole get the girl thing, but its such a dull note that makes one sit there and question the validity of even trying again. It kills the whole buildup all these choices the player makes, and just makes the whole game feel hollow at its core. I know this seems like rambiling on a small part of the game, but it is the fundemental part that the game leads up to the entire time.\n\n2 Things are needed, in my opinion, and potentially yours, to make this game feel complete.\n\n1: A slightly happier ending, sure it doesn't need to be a "you get the girl and live happily ever after" thing, but at least one where the player stays in touch. And yes, try some variation on that note to help give meaning to choices.\n\n2: A more Somber ending, again, no need for extremes, but maybe the bad ending(s) have Emily feel more... distant than the neutral, maybe a bit uncomfortable to talk to the player and she decides to end the friendship.\n\nIts not that the game is bad, but it needs something to give the game more weight. Not just 2 tacked on good and bad endings but a scale of at least ok to not the best feeling. The game has an ending premise that is meant to build that feeling of lack of choice, but there is giving the FEELING of lack of choice, which can be deep and meaningful, and then just giving us the ILLUSION of choice and ripping it out from under us, making the game feel like every choice will just lead to the same goodbye. I feel as though the game could have been much better if the lack of choice came from you not being able to go out with emily, but still at least being friends, as it would give the heft to each choice needed to make the game feel more filling and give a much bigger impact the 2nd 3rd, 4th, and so-on time around.\n\nOverall I'd say this game just needs some meat at the end to give it more weight and fill out some extra replayability. As a FREE 1-2 hour time waster, I can see it. But don't be surprised if you get bored of it after 1 or 2 playthroughs.\n*Kind of a personal opinion but I think the story is so cheezy in the whole "long distance kills relationships of all forms" department, that even though its really enticing, you could still slap some tomato sauce in there and pull a lasagna out.\n\nas a wrapup\n+Enthralling journey\n+Loveable character\n+Good time killer\n+Free\n+-Lasagna grade cliche\n-Replayability will seem limited to some people\n-Endings cause the game to feel hollow\n\nThis is one of those games where I wish steam had a form of "Eh" button where you could say its a mixed bag, but overall as a free, short time waster the game is fine, just don't expect a long or necessarily reapeatedly fuffilling experience","November 24, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

If you played through this at least once you could immediately tell how shallow, uninteresting and broken Emily is. The reaction of the player to the dialogue (very limited) left me feeling furious about how much of a spineless tool he is. In case you didn't get it by now, this is the ultimate friendzone simulator - and she's not even worth the, what, 4 years of senseless back and forth. She won't make up her mind, she's whiny, clingy and oblivious, ALL in the span of a ♥♥♥♥ing 5 minute IRC CHAT CONVO. This girl acts like a 12 year old ALL throughout college. She even gets worse with time. If you played at least a couple of simulation games or dating sims, you KNOW how cheesy/brainless these dialogue options can be - except these always lead to the same outcome (just more or less frustrating to read).\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. Why am I being so rough on an indie sim game that you can easily walkthrough in 10 minutes? Cause I feel like it could have potential. I was a teenager during these years. I listened to those bands and posted those cheesy lyrics and got all the refferences. The soud and ambiance really threw me back a décade and I feel like it could have been something cool.

The game takes place over the period of 5 years and believe me when I say this game is an emotional train.\n\nThis game is incredibly simple. You can pick one of three different options and then you decided on how you want to talk to Emily and then you bash your keyboard to simulate typing. It's all really simple.\n\nThe game graphics are simple as it's a pixel style Windows XP operating system.\n\nThere isn't much I can say about this title due to the very small size of the entire project. It took me only 30 minutes to finish the entire thing, it might take longer for people who want to see the different outcomes, but in the end it's still really short.\n\nEmily is Away is a great title and I suggest everyone to try it out. It's emotional and it's incredibly well written. I want to stay away from spoilers so I won't write anymore, just go and play the game right now.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7.5/10 - Worth Playing\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

A text-based interactive story. (It's important to remember this)\n\nIt has very nice information about the characters hidden in the details to explore if you want, but overall it's a pretty simple game, an Instant Message simulator like those back in the Windows XP era (same sound and graphics too, that's cool).\n\nThe control is interesting when playing for the first time, but it turns to be super annoying when we try to explore the game for a second gameplay. It doesn't give the same immersion like the first time, but I think this is the story's fault...\n\n===| SPOILER ALERT |===\n\nIt may be a spoiler down here so consider play it now, since it's free anyway.\n\nSo, the story... It is okay... But the decisions you have in the game are almost totally worthless. It's feels like doesn't matter if you care or not about Emily, and that's pretty sad. You will say something than the game tells that "Emily will remember that" and it never is used again, neither change anything. I was super disappointed in my second try to see the other options.\n\n===| SPOILER ALERT END |===\n\nI do recommend this experience, once. (It's free and short, what you'll lose if you play?)\n\nI also recommend to do not try play it a second time for any reason. Keep what the game give you for the first time and move to the next one.

I would wholeheartedly reccomend it to everyone who wants to experience a nostalgia rush for free.\n\nI like this game a lot. I do. I feel like it speaks to me, because I started using MSN when i was 10 and it kind of phased away in favor of Facebook and other mobile messengers when i was around 18. I made friends through the use of IM software, sent gigabytes of music, videos and images even though i had a sh*tty internet connection and spent hours just typing like mad. When it all kind of went away I wasn't really aware of how much I am going to miss it.\nWhen i started playing this game it all started coming back to me. And it felt so good.\n\nAnd then came the inevitable, bittersweet ending. To say that I expected anthing else, I would be lying. This exact thing happened to me with almost 95% of people I kept in touch (daily) once over this kind of software.\n\nHonestly, I would reccomend this to any person who was a teenager that used IM software in the period when that software was "in". Believe me, spend a hour of your time and relieve some of your memories you didn't even know you missed :)","January 5","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The complete anithesis to all that Zyzz came to stand for upon his unfortunate, early demise.\n\nAs Zyzz, while you can't seek gains, eat chicken for protein or shred like you might expect, you can actually talk to a woman online. Now, this is where the game really picks up.\n\nThe game allows you to enter a screenname and your real first name. This is a cool little mechanic because at a glance it doesn't seem like much, but Emily will refer to you as your real name occasionally which is great for immerson. Unless you're like me and made your real name 'largecock'. Still, it was heartwarming when she said that I would "...always be largecock. =]" nonetheless. There are also nice references in the form of the display picture you choose which change depending on the chapter, which are good for a bit of a nostalgia-induced smile.\n\nIt's a simple game but the attention to detail is there. Sometimes you'll misspell words and have to correct them, sometimes the discussion becomes so contentious that you'll feel the need to rephrase. It's these little things that really reinforce the feeling that Zyzz is trying his hardest to kindle something between the two of them, albeit relatively unsuccessfuly throughout.\n\nSimple text-based games designed to evoke emotion are by no means new but for my money this is one of the better ones. Zyzz might be a bit of a beta (especially toward the end) and Emily might arbitrarily hold on to menial events for quite long but in the immortal words of Linkin Park which are, for me, intrinsically entwined with that Windows XP wallpaper and IM messengers which would now be considered ancient (yahoo 4 lyf add me on friendster) "In the end, it doesn't even matter," and in the end this game is a worthwhile for a playthrough at the least.\n\nAlso the steam screenshots on this game's page are pretty funny so that's cool.\n\n\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Nothing advances, nothing happens and you as a player can't do anything about it because it's not a game..\nThis isn't really a game because nothing changes as you literally just press one of 3 or 4 options that have absolutly no difference to them and you get the same boring ending each time.\nThe game also tries to be TellTale because every little thing you do is like "Emily will remember that" Emily doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ bro nothing changes xD\nI think this game would be super emotional for guys who had little to no interaction with girls before (which I don't bash it's just how I see it) and are really thirsty for that kind of thing.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, for the developer I'm sure it was more of a self reflection nostalgia piece of art but as a game (and yes, even though it's free) it just doesn't work and in all honesty unless you are some "forever alone" kid who complains about being friendzoned and whatnot you will see that the story kind of feels....Dull? I am saying that because if I were in the main character's shoes I would've done things way differently. The fact that you can't do things your way (or even kind of your way) makes me just look at this whole thing as a story about a guy (the dev I'm assuming) who had trouble talking to a girl back in the day.\n\nAgain no hate for the dev, it's just that his doesn't work as a game in my opinion. The (let's call it) novel is free though so if you got time to burn then why not? Just don't expect something amazing out of it.","November 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You could never relate however as this is pleb music for people with pleb tastes and you're more of a harsh noise, drone, and classical music guy and are above such lowest common denominator trash.\n\nThis is truly an emotional game, it really hammers home the pain of the fact that you will never be able to type as fast as the main character; A Masterpiece of an emotional roller coaster given high marks by top tier critics like Nathan Grayson of Kotaku and Brendan Caldwell of Rock Paper Shotgun. These people have had amazing insight into video games and they haven't led me astray yet, especially now. And it's free! You too can enjoy using a Windows XP themed Commadore 64 to simulate being friendzoned and getting subsequently angry that people "Just don't get me, you know?"\n\nI look forward to future works by Kyle Seeley for he has demonstrated his ability to tell a compelling story.","November 24, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","0"

Not in the sense that it's hard, but that it's unfair as HELL! Don't bother with this at it's current state. I get that it's a different form of "choose your path" type games, but once you get into it, it's just plain bad. Everytime you go for the kill, or make a move on Emily, you delete it without control.  If you decide to go to Travis' party, you later find out you did not kiss Emily when you were alone looking at stars\n\nThis is SO GOD DANG INFURIATING! If the game had more choices, more control, and better actions, I don't care if it had a price then I would get it. I know thats the whole point, not having control.

She's manipulative. If you've ever been in a  relationship like this maybe it'd be more relatable and you'd like it, but I haven't so this whole story was very annoying.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nShe is just working her way around to make you the bad guy -.- Then she guilt trips you like it's always your fault she is a dummy. Then if you say something to tick her off, she says the same thing later like some snarky butt. I really tried to be very nice to her but after I hanged out with her , then she ended up all pissy at me? Like what the heck is that about?\n\nIf you drop the topic she's better, but oh if you want to drop a topic she gets all pissy at you. This girl is backwards.\n\nAnyways, only amusement was having the same name as her and pretty much choosing the most negative answer to everything she said. (Not like it mattered what you chose though because she would always find a way to find something awful about what you said)\n\nI haven't had a relationship like this, so I can't relate, so I dunno.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alchenaut/recommended/417860/","alchenaut","Laser Squid Nemesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alchenaut/","239 products in account","*Some spoilers perhaps*\n\nInteresting short-story game. Sort of like a visual novel, but interactive in a different (slightly annoying) way. You play a guy who is friends with Emily, a girl you clearly have feelings for in your senior year of high school, and you get to view some slices of life through their college years via a recreated AIM interface.\n\nThe sounds are incredibly nostalgic, hearing the door opening/closing sounds made me feel like I was really on AIM again for the first time in many years. Viewing your friends profiles and seeing the various song lyrics and typical things you'd find there is a nice touch too. The creator of the game certainly spent plenty of time on AIM back in the day.\n\nI am not a fan of the fake-typing input that is used here. You pick one of 3 options to converse with, but then you must input the keys yourself. However, since you don't know what exactly is going to be typed, and you are just forwarding the script with random inputs, it essentially feels like you're playing HackerTyper or something. It would have been totally fine if they had just automatically typed in the responses for you once you picked your choice.\n\nWatching the protagonist type in responses, erase them, and then reconsider his words is probably the most compelling part of the story. At first he is just correcting typos, but as you go into the story more, he starts completely rephrasing his words, and in the final chapter, you watch as he completely freezes up and stops writing what he means.\n\nIf you've ever talked to someone you had a crush on over AIM, MSN, or any other kind of chat program, this story may hit close to home for you. I wish there were some different endings, as you get a ton of different answer prompts throughout the game and it even notifies you that Emily will remember certain things you say, but it doesn't seem to make a difference at all.\n\nOverall, it's free, it's short, and it's an interesting approach on telling a story of online-based (or at least, online-oriented) romance. Along with Cibele, I think this is an interesting trend of storytelling. It does have some flaws with the way it is played, but it's a neat game and one that I will remember.","November 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Things get complicated no matter what you do. Lots of people wanted a good ending for this game, but I found it more fitting that there isn't one. Sometimes, situations in real life can have no good ending due to decisions made in the past.\n\nHave you ever spoken to someone you had feelings for or at least really cared about on a messenger, and wanted to tell them how you truly felt? So, you carefully type it all out, but before you can hit send, you feel to scared of what might happen if they know the truth, so you delete it all, and say something far less meaningful?\nWell, that's what you'd experience going through the story. A lot.\n\nAll of the other game references in the quest for icon achievements cheers you up at least, after you get through the story.

I seem to have a cranial bleed from the frustration of pretending to care about this girl called Emily, and so I can only seem to think of three dialogue options, all of them contrived, out of place and thrusting me towards the narrative like a pervert near a playground.\n\nMy ability to be relatively upbeat and supportive without caring about this Tumblrette has me given the bad ending where I am forced to ask questions to someone who I don't care about. There is no option for "okay", "meh" and "I see". The other downfall of AIM is the fact I can't just roll my eyes at the teenage angst on display.\n\nI am forced to pick between pictures of pop culture reference; however, I don't know music so that leaves one film picture per year. Yes, we speak once per year. Talk about a deep, rich friendship I'm trying to maintain.\n\nUltimately, I was promised a rich cheesecake of emotion and found a soggy, half-eaten carrot wrapped in a dirty Greenday album cover and while I normally lament a short game runtime, I couldn't click that goodbye option fast enough to end this "experience".\n\nIf the creator just wants to write a crappy teen angst novel, I suggest he join Nanowrimo next year.","December 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Yet the ending left me frustrated as no matter how many times I played I always got the same ending. The description indicates a branching narritive and you do see notifications such as 'Emily will remember that.' and 'You choose to go to the party.' yet I don't see any meaningful consiquences for those actions. Towards the end the game even removes your dialogue choices. You select an option to reply which is changed to something completely different. I get that there are certain parts of the game where the dialogue changes but even that still relates to the original choice. Finally, the ending pulls a Mass Effect 3 by making all your previous choices irrelevant. It all boils down to a number of options which change when entered, all ending in 'goodbye'. It's fustrating seeing these characters just give up and stop talking. In conclusion, it's a great consept, I love the style and story yet the previously mentioned points work against it.

These are the kinds of lukewarm social shenanigans I try to avoid in real life and yet I find myself reinacting them in a video game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt still gets a recommend because there's nothing wrong with the game itself. It's just that the subject matter is something I personally find just reminds me of all the time I rolled my eyes at my buddies's stupid relationship drama and awkward social ♥♥♥♥♥ footing. Emily was actually the furthest thing away from being attractive so when I said "Goodbye" at the end it was because I was officially done with her crap.","November 27, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

After Telling Emily I am in a relationship, she asks to visit. So ofcourse for  the sake of the story I let her come and visit me , alcohol and all involved in my dorm....Hoping to get some true feelings out of the girl and a little shabang. A YEAR LATER, Emily decided to say things are weird and how she doesn't want to talk about it. THEN WHY THE HELL DID YOU VISIT!?!!? On top of that I play it of cool , Like i dont care about her , AFTER showing her my real feelings. Clearly she made me and my gf Emma break up because in Chapter 5, i mention how me and Emma are just friends now. Honestly she probably just feels really good about herself, because straight from Chapter 1, she comes off as a leading on BI***. Toying around with a nice boys heart "whos ALWAYS there for her after every instant message" And OF COURSE, the typical thing females say to get away from a conversation "Its, weird now, things are weird now... I dont want to talk about it , sorry.... I cant do this right now . Goodbye." Emily should of majored in Theatre because shes a horrible actress and just likes having (ME) around for whenever she feels like ♥♥♥♥. So clearly I cut the broad off short in Chapter 6 , and just cut off the conversation saying Goodbye. I hope we never stay friends. Moral of the story: Females+instant messaging=friendzone.\n\nF U EMILY.\n\n\n","November 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

All I'm sayin is she had the whole package. I graduated from business school, with a small loan of a million dollars, got engaged with emma.  things went smooth till I went to an affair site where i met someone for a one-night stand..anyways, it was a good night. Next day I'm at my boy Mike's house at his cinco de mayo barbeque, I tell him about the one night stand and how i felt all this regret about it and he totally supported me on it. several days later emma starts acting differently but I didnt take it to any consideration. One night in bed listening to Drake, I was reminicing about the times I had with Emily on AIM. so i contacted Nev from the show catfish to find out where I could find Emily, we recoreded a whole show for MTV, i got paid very well by the way. He helped me get her personal information including her skype so I send her a message about, how I was wrong about not feeling the same way and ♥♥♥♥. she responds right-away, says she's going through a divorce with Brad and he owes her over 20 thousand dollars in child support. I told her, sorry to hear that and we spoke from there and we grew a small friendship back. She paid for my ticket to California where she stays. And I told Emma that I was going on a business trip, was going to meet my future mentor Martin Shkreli. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, she believed it. So I landed in LA, where Emily picked me up in her Honda Civic. I was second guessing whether to get in the car but she was wearing some tight pants bruh...anways we get to her house, this ♥♥♥♥♥ lives in the middle of the projects. She introduces me to Brad which is now a leader of some drug-traffiking gang up in LA, and she introduces me to 3 little mexican boys who claim to be her sons. Like...brad was white how did they come out like that? I RAN MY ♥♥♥ TO A HOTEL.  I took my time to catch a flight back before I make any mistakes and ruin my life with Emily's ♥♥♥♥♥ass. On the flight back I was just regretting leaving Emma for that side piece, so i wrote her a letter telling her how much I loved her and bought her a bottle of port wine at the airport, them ♥♥♥♥s cost like 200 hunnit dollars.

That's right.\nIt's supposed to immerse you in the story. But after the first chapter I found myself sitting idly, mashing buttons with one hand while my character typed and erases his messages, which were halfhearted at best.\nI should also bring up that the choices the character makes that matter aren't yours. He can go to a party, and Emily will be there and mention it later. Then she questions choices "you" made there, when actually, after you decide to go, the game just brings you back to the chat window.\nThe ending I got seemed to be a comment about how sometimes you just can't be close to someone the way you used to, which is a fine message. Sometimes you can't do anything about it and just drift apart. But it felt like the character didn't try, or we weren't given the right choices.\nIf there's one thing I took from this game, it's to not let my actual relationships end up like this again. Still, for a game, it's not as involved as I feel it should be, so I don't recommend it.","January 1","false","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I told her that I was interested in her which she said she needed time; being the typical female she took a year to respond but it's ok, it's the mens fault when we don't reply within 3 seconds.\n\nAnyway, I had enough of the b*tch and wished I pursued with Emma but now I'm lonely as I tried to play the guilt trip on her.\n\nTLDR: Still a better love story than Twilight.","November 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

You are a high school senior chatting on AIM. For the thousands who did this same thing.. thumbs up already.\n\nThis game is clever. You enter your information and chat with a girl from school. Each year the dynamic changes as you realize you love her. The amount of times you have to push a button is really rediculous but aside from that this game is a winner.\n\nMuch higher marks if you could communicate with more ease.\n\nIt's FREE.

It's not the thing where neckbeards think that women owe them their love, but it's this bizarre phase right after you confess your feelings, but the other person keeps talking to you, but this time avoiding anything that brings up "that" subject, dodging anything that might even hint at LOVE and DATING. It results in your friendship dying off completely, to the point of either you being too scared to even say anything, or the other person just cutting you away from your life. To the point of making you wish you had never confessed your feelings.\n\n\n\nOh, and Brad can just go die for all I care.","November 26, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Do take note that the hitboxes are terrible though, so you'll end up spending a bit of time trying to find where exactly the game wants you to click. Also, the layer of choice is, sadly, an illusion Don't bother trying multiple runs to get new endings and outcomes -- there are none. You lost the game when you started it.\n\nCheck it out.

The dialogue is also impressively realistic which I really appreciate as it's challenging to find somewhat similar games (simulation, VN, etc) where character dialogue isn't over the top or just plain ridiculous.  The conversations in Emily is Away are simple and not too long- exactly the length a conversation needs to be.  Each subsequent conversation slowly and effectively leads your emotions into a constricted knot of fondness, frustration, and regret.\n\nDefinitely try this game if you're willing to relive the dismal memories of an old crush or if you generally just want to feel like an empty shell once you're done.","February 15","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You start as a High School senior in the 00s, who uses AIM for kicks to talk with his friends, I don't know how they got away with using the AIM graphics. It is the end of your highschool life. You and your friends would like to celebrate, as any average youthful adults would. You and Emily discuss going to the party, but there is this prickly sore in your side named Brad, Brad has been flirting with Emily on the internet.  Watch as you make the worst ♥♥♥♥ing descisions possible, watch as you ♥♥♥♥♥ out with certain dialogue choices. Will you end up with Emily? Will Brad sexually coerce her? Will it all end in flames? Will you kiss her? Will you choose to ♥♥♥♥ her? I won't give anything away, but the fact there is a very emotionally touching yet simple ending and we all learn that we have known girls in our youth like Emily. Overall, I say try it, It is really deep and well done for a free to plane online dating sim type game. I'd reccomend you play it just for the plot and emotional experience of it all. As a FTP 9/10, as an actual game, 7.4/10","December 2, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game simulated truthfully what these types of situations are like and places you in a scenario that we could all easily fall into ourselves. Whilst this game depressed me to no end as it reminded of a similar situation I have been through I think it is a short masterpiece in an indie game package.\n10/10 would cry over a fictional girl again.","November 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
