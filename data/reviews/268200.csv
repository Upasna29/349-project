Played through the game in its entirety. Additions are in italics.\n\n\nFirst things first, the price is right. Regardless of quality, you can seldom go wrong when you see a price like this. The art style of the game is fantastic. It's not something I'd expect from a game with a price tag this low.\n\nThe second thing I noticed is the music. I spent some time sitting at the main menu eating my lunch before I got into playing, just listening to the music. Many people don't realize it, but music is a very important aspect to both film and games, and it helps set the mood. XCOM, for example. in the height of combat, features a pounding bassline. Depending on your preference, Antisquad one-ups it, opting for a full symphony orchestra, to accomplish the same thing and more.\n\nThird, the game sets you off with an optional tutorial, making it easy for players new to the genre to pickup the game and get playing. Many of the old games in the genre don't do much in the way of training, and instead require you to read through enormous manuals (think X-com UFO Defense and Jagged Alliance 2),\n\nAlright, first off, this game utlizes the Action Point system, like Jagged Alliance and X-Com: UFO Def, it does not use movement style of XCOM:EU/EW, which makes perfect sense, certain classes would be hilariously over/underpowered otherwise. Speaking of classes, there are eight characters to choose from, making up five different classes (the classes that double-up have unique abilities which make them different than the character who shares its class), and all of them have their place. Squad size is limited to three, as a result, different character combinations will all yield extremely different styles of play.\n\nAs for general play itself, there is no hit/miss system, nor cover system. So when it comes to tactical elements, your options are to just skirt outside enemy sight range, and to kite the enemy. You have vision over entire map, which allows you to set a plan of attack, and a plan is definitely needed. Enemies, as far as I can tell, have comparable stats, the only advantages you have are your unique character abilities, and the ability to revive your fallen allies. Needless to say, these advantages are absolutely critical to mission success, due to the fact that on the hardest difficulty, hell, you are hilariously outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nAs for character progression, you earn gold with the completion of each mission and for each enemy you kill. (Be warned, if you fail a mission you may actually lose gold, so avoid biting off more than you can chew, and keep to the lower difficulties at first if you just want to progress through the game). With you gold you can upgrade your characters' weapons, armor, as well as individual stats, such as health, number of actions points, etc. It can also be used to purchase consumables such as health packs, temporary stat boosts, etc.\n\n\nComplaints\n\nOne of my minor complaints with the game thus far, is the inability to alter the control scheme in-game. The game currently offers a launcher in which you can adjust video quality, resolution, and your controls, but nothing the actual game has been launched.\n\nAnother problem I have is that you can get gold by posting on twitter and facebook. The game doesn't go out of its way to shove twitter and facebook integration down your throat, it just mentions it casually, but I tend to dislike games that provide advantages by using social media. (Though I can't blame the developers wanting to get the word out about their game!)\n\nAfter progressing through the game, the quality of dialogue has deteriorated immensely. Some games I play for the story, others for the gameplay, some for both. This game falls more in the middle of those three categories, so it's not an end-all. The game tries to have a story, and it's not too difficult to make sense of, it's just not put together very well in that regard, though it can very easily be fixed in later patches.\n\nHaving beaten the game on "Hell" difficulty (the hardest difficulty), there needs to be an additional difficulty unlocked once you've beaten all missions on "Hell", it's just too easy once your squad is upgraded. Every single mission is effortless, with the exception of one, Losing Control. That mission is absurdly difficult, even with a fully upgraded squad. If every mission were around that level of difficulty on the next difficulty setting, the game would be incredibly challenging.\n\nLastly, there are bugs here and there, which is to expected in beta. I haven't encountered any bugs in actual gameplay, only in the menus, which is great, as it hasn't impeded my gameplay. The bug: skills and stats can be upgraded. Action points can be upgraded 8 times, +5 each time. I believe I was only able to upgrade it 7 times on one character, yet it yielded +10 on one upgrade, so technically the end result was the same, just getting there was just quicker. I have encountered another bug which does effect character stats: if you have a soldier with an upgraded weapon and/or armor, and they drop into a bleedout, upon revival they lose the stats from the items for the remainer of the mission (though this makes perfect sense and is fair were it intended).\n\n\ntl;dr All in all, it's a fun game, with lots of replayability. If you're even the slightest bit interested in the genre, you can't go wrong with picking this up, especially for the price. Hell, I've already spent 20 hours on the game, a 1:5 dollars spent:hours played ratio. I definitely got my moneys worth, even if I am mostly done playing the game until the next update.","February 20, 2014","true","24.3"," 113 of 131 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","113","131","0","5"

And, although they're no longer present in the PC port, you can still see their influence in the design of the game, because you either grind your way through the same missions over and over again just so you can afford the upgrades to beat the harder levels or... well, with no microtransactions at all there's not even an alternative, you either grind those upgrades or you're not going anywhere.\n\nSo, if you want a good turn-based strategy game, try something else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatari/recommended/268200/","Shatari","Shatari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatari/","1665 products in account","This game frustrates me to no end, because it starts off great. Act One is easy, but makes great use of the mechanics and has some decent drive to it. Sadly, the translator and play testers for the game appears to have quit the second they saw Act Two and Act Three, because everything after the intro is a trainwreck. The levels are boring, the interface has no idea how to click the right spot on the map (and misclicks are harshly punished), Act Two's difficulty is just adding hitpoints to the bad guys, Act Three instead just gives them suicide bombs, a million movement points, and the ability to instantly know where you are, while the writing goes from vaguely forgettable banter to nonsensical gibberish. (I'm convinced that the "witty" banter is bugged and it's only supposed to be playing one or two lines at a time and instead plays all of them. It's the only way to explain this, unless everyone contracted Parkinson's disease in between Act One and Act Two.)\n\nOh, and it's a port of a mobile game so you'll want to use Cheat Engine to bypass all of the grinding. It knocks off most of the playtime this title has (it's amazingly short), but there's no reason to replay the same missions over and over again just to get around the obstacles they intended you to pay to bypass.\n\nAll told, if you can get it super cheap then you'll probably get some good fun out of Act One. If you enjoy trying to decipher Russian to English Google translations then the stories Act Two and Three might amuse you as well, but the gameplay is awful.","September 29, 2014","false","14.4"," 47 of 63 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","47","63","2","5"

I consider myself somewhat competent when it comes to turn-based tactical games, especially RPGs, but I find myself struggling at even the lowest difficulty setting. One false move of one of your squad members can mean their death, even with full health and defense. Apparently this is a port of a mobile game and I imagine there would be microtransations to upgrade your squad members, but since there is none of that here, all you can really do to upgrade your one-hit-one-kill crew is grind missions over and over to afford the upgrades using the in-game currency. And in all honesty, that is not a lot of fun no matter how you look at it.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for me was when I earned the "A Run of Bad Luck" achievement which is awarded for five consecutive unsuccessful attempts at a mission.

There is a lot of style and personality to the game with its characters. There is a bit of skipable dialog before and after each mission. A lot of the fun and challenge comes from the combat. It is a game of chess, 3 troops of your choosing vs a small army. Your troops are just as frail as the enemies. You need to be smarter than their numbers. Enemies become alert when they spot your troops or see their allies die. It feels like a port of a mobile game. Everything is a mouse click, so it feels very click heavy and if you can overlook that, its a great game for its customization and combat.\n\nYou have five troops at the start, but you can hire more. The troops are basically a sniper, a scout, a explosives expert, an assaulter (armored weapons melee expert), and a heavy gunner. Each of these troops has two of their own special abilities. One is a special attack like a dart to slow enemies, a knife to break through enemy armor, a grenade to do area damage and the other is a passive skill that lasts a few turns and has a cooldown, such as a smoke screen to hide allies, armor increase to increase the armor of everyone around and so on. Everything your troops do cost 'action points' and all characters start out with the same amount of AP. Moving, attacking, using skills and reviving fallen allies cost AP, but for each character, every action costs a different amount of AP. So the scout's movement costs 6 AP, her attacks cost 12 AP and smokescreen costs 54 AP vs the sniper's 40 AP attack and 30 AP dart skill. The only thing that doesn't cost AP are items that you find or buy in the store. If one of your troops has AP remaining after their turn, and an enemy attacks them, they will fight back if they have enough AP. This allows you to let enemies come to you.\n\nSince it is turn based, everyone on your team gets to use all their AP and then everyone on the other team gets to use all of theirs. The game does a good job of showing the distance you can travel with the remaining AP, but shows how much you'll have left when you're done traveling and even what distance you need to be in order to attack someone. You will need to double click for most every move, because the first click is just to show what you'll be doing. Click on an enemy to see their stats and what things you can do to them, double click to attack them. One click to see where you'll move, the AP you'll have left and how the enemy will react and double click to move there. You get the idea.\n\nOne way the game seems shallow, there's no sort of hit percentages, fog of war or height advantages like in other games. Its all just flat terrain with objects and walls for cover. There are no destructible environments. Again, its not as deep combat strategy wise as other games. There's still a lot of depth in upgrades.\n\nBefore a mission begins, you can buy items, guns, gear and upgrade each character for a cost. Upgrade their attack damage, movement, armor and so on. Every layer of armor is just an extra hit they can take, such as someone with 3 armor can be shot 3x before it'll drain their health. Once they're out of health, they're down. When they're down an ally can revive them, but if they aren't revived in X amount of turns, they're gone from the mission, but not forever.\n\nThe missions have simple objectives, get to here, kill all enemies, blow up this or that. Sometimes you'll have to push buttons to open doors or operate things to kill enemies. Some of the areas are pretty straight forward, but others allow for flanking and different routes. Each mission feels like a healthy amount of gameplay. Not just that, but when you head into each mission, you chose your difficulty from four difficulties. Its a nice feature and adds replayability to missions when you need to grind for gold to buy upgrades.\n\nSo when I say port of a mobile game, to me that would send up red flags of 'pay to win' or microtransactions. There seems to be none of that here, all of the gold you get in the game comes from winning (or losing) missions, completing challenges, killing enemies and clicking on them. Yes that's right you need to click on dead enemies for whatever reason. I guess that prevents wasting turns from touching each one. Some enemies can drop power ups for the mission that you need to have your troops physically collect. Enemies know to collect them instead of you to power up themselves. Other times, you get crates that when you are between missions, you can open them and have random loot. Some games charge you $2.50 to open crates.\n\nIn all, the game feels simpler than other tactical turn based games, yet still a lot of fun. The depth comes from the customization. Its a beautiful game to look at and that adds to the enjoyment of the game. It feels polished for a $6 game and I got a lot for my money, even if it is click heavy.","October 21, 2014","true","11.8"," 48 of 84 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","48","84","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/268200/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A strategy/tactics game with nice graphics, decent story, and somewhat stereotypical characters and situations representing various countries. If you're not willing to grind out old maps for gold, then this game isn't for you because replaying maps for gold is pretty much mandatory to make later enemies easier. If you're not good at tactics games or don't like taking things slowly, this game isn't for you because there are enemies that can easily kill your characters if you aren't prepared because they have enough Action Points to move large distances and shoot many times.\n\nRight now I'm up to the third campaign, Morning Star (if you include the first tutorial campaign).\n\nThe english in the beginning is pretty awkward and poorly translated, but it gets a lot better later on. There are still some mistakes/oddities ('Eliminate the elite forces. None of the squad should not perish.' and 'Above the rate of fire!'), but the dialogue between characters is acceptable.\n\nAfter the tutorial maps, losing a map after clearing some enemies nets you ~3-10k gold, while clearing a map gives ~25-40k. The costlier upgrades cost ~27k-40k and opening the tier 2 reward boxes requires ~15k each. You will probably want to clear Normal stages first and ignore higher difficulties until you upgrade your characters enough. Since you don't get much gold, try to concentrate your gold on upgrading a couple core characters that you use (upgrading Teddy's Guard Ability to grant 2 shields is pretty useful). Buying items can save your run, but they cost a lot of gold which (in the long run) is better spent on permanent upgrades. You have to take things slowly and carefully, use Guard right before an encounter to absorb any fire they get in, and try to disable anyone you can't finish off.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Beat all stages I own in the Antisquad Original on hardest difficulty and cleared all stages I own in Antisquad Tactics. All the missions I had in Tactics were tutorial-like, so you might as well play through those before playing the original game. It plays pretty much the same but everything is cheaper, characters have less upgrade tiers, and the stages are a lot easier (at least on normal difficulty). The two versions don't share anything (gold, items, etc.).\n\nIn Original, I found a small stage that gave decent gold that I could clear quickly and easily. I ground that level for gold for key upgrades until I could beat it on higher difficulty levels (it gave ~60k normal, ~130k highest difficulty). After that, levels were mostly a cakewalk. You unlock new weapons and armor to buy when you upgrade your character's stats enough to increase their rank. It can be very effective to increase damage through a better weapon and start with more armor from a better outfit.","February 16, 2015","true","17.4"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

Each contract is a story which progresses through each mission.\n\nBefore each mission you can select your 3 team members you want to take along. You have originally a choice of 5, each with unique weapon skills and special skills. During the course of the game you can hire additional members as well.\n\nEach member has 1 unique special skill + item slots you can pre-populate before each mission.\n\nEach Mission can be played in one of several difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Hell. Each raised difficulty level gives bigger rewards along with the raised risk or death.\n\nDuring a mission you navigate your team through a map using your characters action points wisely. Inspecting your enemies and their stats, skills, visibility and shooting range can help and give you an advantage when planning where you are moving your team member to and how many Action Points to leave for special or counter attacks.\n\nAfter you kill an enemy you can click the dead body to reveal item drops, which can be anything from extra cash to item boxes you can open between each mission or temporary attribute perks that can be applied immediately to a team member when walking over them.\n\nThe game has tons of STEAM achievements as well as in-game challenges, such as "Use 4 Special Skills in a single Mission" or similar.\n\nI personally find this game very entertaining and would certainly recommend it.\nThe price definitely is more than fair for this title.\n\nThe scripted dialogue from the characters during each mission that progress the story reads nicely and make the game feel more like a story you play through rather than just mindlessly playing each mission.\n\nThe characters have entertaining personalities and each have a unique feel when played.\n\nGreat value for money for sure.","June 6, 2014","true","8.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

It's designed for touch. It's clunky with mouse and keyboard and I spent most of my time fighting with the interface rather than enemies. There's also a huge amount of interface lag. I play on a 144hz monitor and this game feels like I'm playing in a layer of glue. Scrolling is slow. Menus and options are terrible. The interface "select" or "affirmative" sound effect makes me want to punch someone in the face. It's that awful "bubble pop" sound effect that you hear when some tween on 'Pretty Little Liars' gets a text mesage. I guess that makes me think of gangsters with guns? Also, why do I have to click on enemies I've already killed to get the reward from them? With the same button that makes me move? Hire an interface and UI designer already.\n\nSo far, this game is crappy to play on pc and probably on anything. Tooltips and mouseovers have been around for 10+ years.

The overall art and visual character design is awesome. The individual characters have a lot of unique personality. The systems, UI and combat are incredibly tedius. They throw so many ideas, menus and characters at you within the first 20 min that it can be very overwhelming. Everything takes twice as many clicks as it should. The lethality is very high so enemies and your characters die within 1-2 hits in most cases. Its obvious this was originally designed to be a free to play, cashgrab game because of the wildly expensive coin system. Anti Squad has a ton of potential, but the design fell way short of being a good game.","January 9","false","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hope it will help with those making a decision to purchase.\n\nIn Antisquad, you will be in-charge of a group of mercenaries who basically fight for good.  You will start with about 5 or 6 and you can add another 3-4 to the team via purchase.  The game is turn-based and attacks always hit, there is no random chance to hitting something with an attack.  It is your attacks, skills, and special attacks versus the enemies.   In that regard it plays a bit like chess or Stratego or a board game without random chance.  The most important thing is to choose you moves and actions carefully, in the right order, and to consider what the consequences are before hand.\n\nGameplay itself is sort of a mix of chess and XCOM EU.  The setting is much like Jagged Alliance 2 or similar tactical strategy games.  There is banter between the characters.  Each character has unique skills and attacks, but are mostly of one class.  Classes include a scout, assault, demolitions, so on.  But each character within a class has some different special abilities.  Characters not only can upgrade their attacks and skill, but attributes,  personal weapon and outfit (armor) (which is  only useable by that character), and additional items that are useable by anyone such as medkits, stims, grenades, and armor power ups.\n\nThe game advances through missions.  Each mission is part of a series of missions that make up a chapter, I suppose.  I'll have to check on their lingo a bit later.  I believe only some of the chapters are advancing the story, others may be selected as you wish.  To her experience and gold to purchase things, you can replay these missions over and over, at any difficulty you choose, once it is available.  Or just proceed to the next mission as you wish.\n\nThe game was first made for tablets, is very colorful, the AI is good, the game is entertaining and makes you think.  But you finish each individual mission in a chapter at easy or normal difficulty, in about 15 mins to an hour.  However this is early in the game in the first three chapters at easy and normal.  It gets more involved later.  The point is that you don't have to plan a whole evening around playing it.\n\nThe game on the pc is user friendly.  While on the Title screen tips will come up, you can click on these pop-up boxes daily and receive some gold, a nice touch.  You can equip items in your personal backpack of each character depending on the outfits pockets, you can even have them airdrop some items from the store during a mission but for extra cost.  There does seem to be a character with a personal item that if purchased reduces these airdrop costs also.  Fantastic!\n\nThe key concepts to remember for newer players are:\n\n1) All attacks and skills hit.  2) If you kill it during the action, the enemy cannot counter-attack  3)Read the help and learn from the tutorials and tips.  It is all accessible in-game as you play.  3) There is an icon that explains if someone can counter-attack or not.  See the help etc   4) The mission will have drops that can benefit you, both placed and as enemies die.  5) Learning when a unit can counter-attack or not is important in the game.  You need to have enough enery, enough range, a trait, or a power-up or other bonus that overrides the lack of stamina or action points.\n\nThe game is well polished, looks great, runs on an Intel HD 2500 gpu smoothly.  It runs on Win7-64 bit no issues.  I recommend the game as long as you don't see it as a fully fleshed out Fallout, XCOM, or Jagged Alliance type game.  It is more like Chess meets XCOM-EU missions.   It's like Stratego or a bit like Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, it's not a simulation or full RPG like Arma or Jane's Fighters would be in comparison to those.\n\nI think that will do for now as a review.","June 21, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well it's a turn base tactical action game, similar to Jagged Alliance, Shadow Run, X-Com Serie, Commandos, Desperados....\nYou are in command of a small team of Mercs, (Military Special Force, Expendables, No Lifers... whatever) send to clean the world infested with baddies, gangsters, cartel drug dealers, criminals, terrorists, WMD users and other Nutters that threaten our peacefull planet. (damn scumbags)\n\nAt your disposal, you have a wide range of gears and weapons that you can use to perform your missions, as long as you have enough money to buy them, money that you'll earn from killing baddies, acconplishing challenges, keeping your team alive....\nEach of your character has a specific set of skills so select your team carefully before you start your mission.\nThe game has a simple storyline, missions are to: kill this, go there, push this, kill more, nuke end boss, go to next stage, buy gears, upgrade characters..a feeling of 'deja vu'. However, Antisquad is a really enjoyable game and makes it up with nice graphics where the characters kinda look like in TF2, a good atmospheric soundtrack short but brutal and bloody missions with some nice surprises along the way.\nAntisquad will not win the Tactical Game of the year but it SURE will give you tonnes of fun time and hours spend trying to complet the long list of Achievements and challenges.

It's surprisingly good, and if you've played any game of the genre, you'll feel right at home here.\n\nIt hails from iOS/mobile gaming, so the UI seems to be optimized for tablet usage, which is no big deal after all. Graphics and style are actually neat, sound is a bit simple/repetitive, but functional. So far, I've encountered no game-breaking bugs or crashes.\n\nThankfully(!) they ripped out everything concerning micro-transactions. Everything can be bought with in-game cash, the way it should be. No Facebook-friends nor credit cards required.\n\nYou may choose from eight characters to form a squad of three, which adds a bit of customization. While they fall into your usual classes like Scout or Sniper, every character brings a few unique skills to the table. No cover system exists, neither does fog of war. You'll have to analyze the field and lure the enemies to you in a smart way, trying to neutralize them before they can hurt your guys. That's where your tactical prowess is needed.\n\nWhile it sure is a casual game, containing fifteen rather short missions, and with combat quite simplified, it's not even that easy. Especially on the highest difficulty setting, it actually gets you scratching your head a bit. Of course, you can always grind the earlier missions to accumulate money for upgrades, gear and powerups.\n\nAll in all, a great way to get your quick strategy fix. Well worth the asking price of just four bucks. Actually, I endorse it by my right as an XCOM veteran. Just buy it.","April 5, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Though, I didn't have much experience with it (the genre).  So, I was going in as a noob, with only a basic grasp of the gameplay style.  Unlike some other early access titles I'm sampling, this one requires little to no previous experience.  So you can pick this up, click play, and you're ready to go!\n\nThe GUI is very very user friendly as well, it reminds me of a facebook game's UI.  Don't let that phrase scare you, that would be the only common ground between this and a facebook game.  From the buttons, to the icons, to the fonts, and HUD.  The GUI adds to the experience.  I only mention this, because strategy games can get a little cumbersome with the UI.\n\nGameplay is really really smooth, the animations are fluid, and the mobs are very well drawn.  It ranks high in all of these points, so much so that I am surprised this is being called early access.  If you're hunting for bugs, I doubt you'll find many.  After 9 hours of play/test time, I've run into none.\n\nGameplay itself is pretty standard for a RPG theme.  (I know this is strategy, but I don't have as much experience there!) From your clothing (all one piece) to weapons (restricted to character types) it has some moderate perks/upgrades.  All of which are based on in game currency, which you get from a plethora of tasks.  You can share your progress on Twitter or Facebook to earn coins, or just kill the baddies.  You also recieve a hefty ransom on completion of levels, and as a random win from "crates".  (These also drop from mobs, though more rare than moola.)\n\nSo far, replayablity is high.  Each level has 3 (4 if you count easy) difficulty levels, which doesn't just "up" mobs, it switches them out for more mobs, or takes the "upping" route.\n\nOverall personal rating would be 8/10.  If they add more levels, characters, and upgrade/perks it will bump it up to a 9 (then 10 if they add all 3!)","February 22, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The look is fantastic, the use of color is beautiful, and the humor is amusing. The combat system takes a little bit getting used to and can at times seem a bit unforgiving, especially if your used to turn based team combat games such as Xcom, and Wasteland. Lets face it in some of those games your guys can take a hailstorm of bullets before they drop. Not so much in Antisquad, at least at the beginning, once you have made some money you can upgrade your team members to withstand more damage. So if your starting out and either getting shot down, or are just barely making it through, don't fret, your guys will get stronger pretty quickly if you spend your money right.\nAlso I was only compairing Antisquad to Wasteland and Xcom as they are all turn based strategy games, but really the simularies all end there. I could pick it all apart and say where Antisquad excells and where it fell short, but that would serve no real purpose. If your reading this, your wondering if this game is right for you. A few simple questions will answer that for you.\n1) Do you enjoy turn based strategy games? (If yes, then this is a good match for you)\n2) Do you prefer your games to have a sense of humor to them or do you prefer them to be more serious? (If you like a bit of humor then this game is a good match for you.)\n3) Do you want your games to have good soild graphics, or do you think the graphics don't matter as much in a strategy title? (If you like graphics and want your games to "look good" then this game is a good match for you.)\n\n","June 21, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, before you start playing, there are some differences between Antisquad and other quality games which you should know about:\n\nFirst and foremost, excessive clicking is required. It appears that this game was made for phones or tablets. Now, maybe this is only true during the lengthy tutorial, but I wouldn't know. I never got past the game holding my hand as if I were a semi-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child.\n\nDuuuurrrrr...I mean secondly, the tutorial. During the tutorial the game will only allow you to do exactly as the game instructs you. Even if you click somewhere else, nothing happens. I will note that Antisquad does a very adept job at telling you how the game works during the first mission, but after that I firmly believe they should leave you alone. Instead, going into the second mission the game is still like that creepy uncle that just hangs around and wants to hold your hand. I did not make it past the second mission because, personally, I prefer to figure games out on my own, at my own pace, and am not afraid of failing miserably once or twice while doing so. Though, with the simplicity of Antisquad, I doubt even the most mentally challenged gamers will fail to complete missions successfully from what I've seen.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is graphically appealing and may even be fun. I just can't help but feel a little violated after all of the excessive hand holding and whisperings of sweet nothings in my ear as I attempt to play.\n\n10/10 GOTY","June 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But main difference is that on normal enemies usually drop useless one time buffs instead od money value.\n\nAs you progress you collect money (from doing missions, killing enemies and completing challanges) then you invest it to develop characters and buy useables.\n\nAs it is one disadventage is here - to max even only three characters out of 8 (or 9) you will have to repear missions at least few times, so kind of grinding is needed.\n\nOverall game is fun and easy going, different characters have different synergy, however you have to decide which ones you like and invest into only few of them.\n\nI think game is worth the money for fans of tactical games.","September 3, 2014","true","42.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Antisquad is a no-frills turn based strategy which takes the genre back to basics, while still encouraging players to think tactically. Antisquad's combat focuses on line of sight rather than cover, and players many times need to sneak carefully around in order to avoid pulling dozens of mobs on accident. It can be deliciously tense when things go wrong, but there are balance issues. Being in alpha, there are characters who are massively OP compared to their counterparts. Scouts, for example, can move almost the range of the entire map, attack multiple times, and still take a few rounds of damage before they go down. This creates a problem as the game has many characters to be enjoyed, but playing optimally is often a matter of forgoing frontline combatants and taking only scouts / snipers. Still, different characters synergize well together, and can be a joy to play depending on your group composition. A huge amount of gear and upgrades are available for each character which change both their attributes and appearance, giving the game a huge density of content for the price you pay. Definitely worth watching.","February 22, 2014","true","6.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Can't blame a mobile port too much, but why even bother porting such a lackluster product. Tactical depth is as shallow as a glass of water when you want to swim. Gold mechanics force you to replay missions over and over to buy tiny stats upgrades that you absolutely NEED (obviously that was used to stick in microtransactions that they had some decency to remove in a PC port). I like tactical games so i really wanted to give it a shot but in the end it wasn't worth my time.","May 24","false","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
