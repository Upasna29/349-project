Has some old school elements of timing your jumps as well. Some of the puzzles lead you into believing you need the wrong type of zombie so you will find yourself choosing the wrong one and then suddenly it clicks and you kick yourself for the 20 minutes you just wasted pointlessley. You get a rating ( up to 3 stars ) for your time and how many of your zombies you killed in the process, some levels allow you to expire a few zombies as it is neccesary, others will deduct stars from you for killing any of your zombies\n\nSeems to be very well made and  i havent encountered any problems so far. plays very smoothly with the xbox pad. if you love puzzles/ platformers / zombies you cant go wrong - especially at the sale price.","November 11, 2014","true","1.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","32","41","0","0"

Makes me want to play the next level over and over again. It usually the story that makes me want to continue the game.\nThere are 70 test levels within 5 phase with phase 1-4 contain 15 tests and phase 5 contains 10 tests.\n\nThere are also trading cards and achievements that makes it more fun to play.\nDefinitely recommended.","October 25, 2015","true","4.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I probably just didn't pay enough attention.\n\nPicture a mobile game where you are running right constantly and can only jump. It's kind of like that, but much deeper, and one zombie can jump, another can stick to surfaces and loops around platforms (there may be more than 2 types). You cannot turn around and run the other way, at least with the two zombies I tried. You choose which zombie to use and which way to start running at the beginning of each attempt at the level.\n\nThe puzzles are clever, but do take a lot of trial and error.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, i'ts defintely worth the money.\n","November 14, 2014","true","0.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/recommended/320150/","jpsf91","jpsf91","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/","478 products in account","An awesome puzzle-platformer game. To beat the 70+ levels, you'll first need to figure out the approach to tackle them, and then reach the exit. There's enough diversity in the levels, and some act as tutorials for some new mechanics that are gradually introduced. For me, the puzzle sections aren't really that hard, but some of the platforming sections are. However, this game has simple controls. For each deadling, you only use one button for control. One deadling walks, two use jumps (but one stick to the walls) and another fly. This last one i find quite annoying to control, t's like flappy bird, but much better. Even at full price, the lenght and variety of this game make it worth. Last, i need to adress two bonus levels: 3 and 10. Those were very hard for me to beat, because you need to control the flying deadling (the worst one) for a long time and you need to be very precise. A very cool indie to your library, especially on sale.","May 1, 2015","true","16.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

A tutorial for this game is about as necessary as directions on a shampoo bottle.\n\nAt the start of the level you are able to look around the typicall small level, and decide upon a strategy. Usually these aren't too difficult, and it should be rather obvious what you need to do. You then select the zombie you wish to use for that attempt, and choose a direction for the zombie to run (left or right). From there, it is mostly just a timing based game, as you'll need to click at the proper times so your zombie doesn't get chopped to pieces by buzzsaws or whatever.\n\nAs I said before, this game isn't amazing, but it definitely shouldn't be considered a bad game. I got it in a bundle, and I intend on finishing it, as it should only take about 3-4 hours for a single playthrough (I'm currently 1/4 of the way through with .6 hours, but I've kind of been rushing through).\n\nWould recommend if you want to get it in a bundle or on sale, or at full price if you've exhausted some of the better options for games of this genre.","March 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I thought it was a game where I could platform myself through a level but you don't actually control the characters. You press a button to make a zombie come out of a door and you hit the jump button at the right time to make him jump during his automated walk cycle. All you do is press jump when needed. In the levels I played, you had to press jump immediately as he comes out to avoid a sawblade but it takes a few tries to get the timing down perfectly. I'm sure it is challenging but who cares. I thought it was a platformer and it isn't.\n\nI wasn't expecting much since I bought a bundle for Crimsonland so this is an afterthought and not really what I want in a game. It just makes me want to play Angry Birds or other similar but better games on my Windows phone.","December 8, 2014","false","0.1"," 32 of 64 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","32","64","0","18"

The game is incredibly light on anything that might explain it - clearly it suffers from its crummy smartphone roots.\n- Cute graphics and the controls feel solid, at least.\n- An interesting idea, to have the character just automatically run and all you control is the jumping (or at least that's all I can tell from this poorly explained game)\n\nMy take is that it's barely worth $1 at most.  You'll be doing better than I did if you can figure out the controls and what you're supposed to do or even how to turn a zombie minion around so he'll run in the other direction.\n\nI'd give it a 60% but since I can't even figure out how I'm supposed to play this, I'm knocking it down to a 40% - don't purchase.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadgaiko/recommended/320150/","deadgaiko","Dead Gaiko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadgaiko/","153 products in account","-- Six important points about Deadlings: Rotten Edition --\n\n1) The title music is insanely cool!\n\n2) A lot of reviews compare this to 'Super Meat Boy' and 'Plants VS Zombies'. Those a rubbish comparisons. Deadlings is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer: you evaluate the level, decide which zombies are best at each task, then you set them running into the level (inputting single commands like jumping, but never directional input). This game is immensely more like 'Lemmings' and a little bit like 'Braid' and other less-manic puzzle-platformers.\n\n3) The fact this game isn't like those other famous titles is not an insult. This game is a great little gem! As you progress, the game expands on your options and the depth of the puzzles. I highly recommend not worrying about good scores initially and instead try to clear levels, otherwise you won't see much of the game's brilliant concepts for a long while.\n\n4) This game is very much worth it's asking price, and it's an easy purchase when on sale! Few games are both this well made, and be within anyone's price range. Not perfect, but nothing that would really ruin your fun.\n\n5) You can only unlock one level at a time, by completing the previous level. If you are stuck, this game doesn't offer you much else to do. This is the game's one major flaw.\n\n6) There's also a weird interaction that 'Bonebag' (your fast-running zombie that jumps) will literally explode if he runs into a wall or clips into the side of a platform.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadgaiko/recommended/320150/","deadgaiko","Dead Gaiko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadgaiko/","153 products in account","-- Six important points about Deadlings: Rotten Edition --\n\n1) The title music is insanely cool!\n\n2) A lot of reviews compare this to 'Super Meat Boy' and 'Plants VS Zombies'. Those a rubbish comparisons. Deadlings is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer: you evaluate the level, decide which zombies are best at each task, then you set them running into the level (inputting single commands like jumping, but never directional input). This game is immensely more like 'Lemmings' and a little bit like 'Braid' and other less-manic puzzle-platformers.\n\n3) The fact this game isn't like those other famous titles is not an insult. This game is a great little gem! As you progress, the game expands on your options and the depth of the puzzles. I highly recommend not worrying about good scores initially and instead try to clear levels, otherwise you won't see much of the game's brilliant concepts for a long while.\n\n4) This game is very much worth it's asking price, and it's an easy purchase when on sale! Few games are both this well made, and be within anyone's price range. Not perfect, but nothing that would really ruin your fun.\n\n5) You can only unlock one level at a time, by completing the previous level. If you are stuck, this game doesn't offer you much else to do. This is the game's one major flaw.\n\n6) There's also a weird interaction that 'Bonebag' (your fast-running zombie that jumps) will literally explode if he runs into a wall or clips into the side of a platform. It makes sense from a gameplay-design perspective, but is visually doesn't make sense and it's infuriating to behold! Just a minor flaw but when puzzle games can be taxing on your patience, you REALLY notice stuff like that! Especially since everything else in the 'Rotten Edition' is so crisp and well designed!\n\n-- MY RATING: 8.7 --\n\nGet it cheap, play it little-and-often, and enjoy!","March 16","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is not entirely bad.  I got through the game a few levels a day, since that was about all I could take.  I thought there was 15 levels and I was OK with that, but it turned out to be 60 levels, with 10 bonus levels.  In 15 hours I completed all 60 with 3 stars (one for completion, one for all brains and one for beating the time) and a few of the bonus levels, with a few levels completed on nightmare difficulty.  That's right, a difficulty that is just off the charts.  Needless to say, the difficulty is not for everyone and I got my money's worth without trying the extreme frustration level.  So even skipping like half the game, it is well worth buying and I highly recommend it.","January 12","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
