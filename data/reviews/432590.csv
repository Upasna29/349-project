I suck at reaction speed so I died....alot.  This happens to me in most games but unlike other games I didn't feel like quiting and giving up.  Despite dying (lots) it was enjoyable and made we want to keep trying.  Addictive as hell infact.  I love the different spells you collect, I love that you can sneak up on enemies which actually makes it a skillful game rather than hack n slash.  A nice game that will probably go under most peoples radar.  My advice to the devs will be to get youtubers involved.  I had been following this game for a while when I found it on Steam Greenlight but not a single youtube video can be found when put into the seach engine.","March 1","true","2.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","21","23","2","0"

I couldn't get the whole "sneaking" business going though.\nI think that if the developer will keep adding features and content with future updates, this game could become huge.","March 2","true","7.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Encourages the player to think before rushing in. The game seemed hard at first but did not take long to get accustomed to. If you like old school games that have a simple but challenging gameplay, this is one that you should atleast try.","March 2","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's well done and the movement and fighting were good.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the store page to notice that it was permadeath. I no longer have the patience to keep starting over and requested a refund, but if you are ok with permadeath, it is fun for the price.","March 2","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you can take permadeath and love a challenge, this is a great game for you! The randomly generated levels make each playthrough completely unique, with fresh challenges and mazes.\n\nAlso, completely bug-free. This game is perfect!

Overall polish is great.","March 18","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haloinverse/recommended/432590/","haloinverse","HaloInverse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haloinverse/","773 products in account","If this is an action-combat game, the controls shouldn't be so freakin' awkward. This might be playable with a controller, but the click-to-move scheme isn't conducive to combat where your first mistake pretty much ends your game.\nIf this is a stealth game, enemies shouldn't be able to see/hear you through walls when you're standing still or sneaking.\nIf this is a roguelike, there should be tactical decisions deeper than roll-past-enemy-and-hope-you-don't-get-hit-even-ONCE.\n\nI'm sorry, but I couldn't figure out how to play this game the way it wanted me to play it - and neither the gameplay itself nor the atmosphere could compel me to struggle through.\nUnforgiving combat + inaccurate control + non-functional stealth = fail.","May 13","false","0.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
