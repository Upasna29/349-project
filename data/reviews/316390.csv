All the Russian players that transfered over to the steam server where all above level 25 and most of them were already maxed put at level 30. They got to bring 2 level 5 weapons that will kill the lower level stalkers with 1 or 2 shots and they were allowed to bring 1 set of level 5 armor which level 4 weapons and below hardly do any damage to them at all. Also its almost impossible for new players ever to get level 5 weapons as they know where the artifacts spawn that are needed to make them and they camp those area's amd KOS all english players.\n\nThey continued to scam "devs" the EU server English only players by giving the "updates" in Russian only, weeks before the update comes out so the Russian players knew what was changing and made there adjustments before the patch was released and Only would give the patch notes in English after it went live and most of the time it was only half translated just to cause more problems for English only players. So what happened all the English only players started quiting then they Started the 'STEAM" server and shut down the EU server. A lot of English only players lost A lot of $ when they did that. It was the DEV'S fault 100%. The Russian players knew the game was shutting down months ahead of the English only players but we were quiting by then anyway's.\n\nSo will this happen to the STEAM server only time will tell but did they ever announce anywhere on the STEAM forums about the transfers they gave for a price of 500Gr and must be at least level 25 to transfer to steam server? NO! they did not why? Also they got 2 bring 2 level 5 weapons and 1 level 5 armor. NO! why? They wanted to keep there Russian players happy while they screwed over all the STEAM new stalkers that will be nothing but easy 1 or 2 shot kills for them.\n\nDon't waste your time or your $ like I did and many many others did on the EU server.\n\nBTW they perma banned me from the forums when I posted about the transfers from the UE server and what they were allowed to bring with them to the STEAM server. They can't ban my review.\nYou can read about the pro's and con's from many many other review's, this review is about the "DEV"S" and how they treat there other than Russian player base. So if you think this review is not helpful about the game then your're a ♥♥♥♥♥ or Russian.\n\nUPDATE May 31st 2016.\n\nAlmost a year later and I wanted to see how the game is coming along. I created a stalker on both the PVP USA server and the PVE EU server.\n\nThe PVP USA server is almost completly empty of English players. Russian Clans control the entire map and bases and will not allow any English clan to have one. Two Russian clans control the entire game and maps "Storm" and "Volga". Volga was the Clan that camped noob gates and spawns that ruined the old EU server before steams release. This server has the lowest player base I have ever seen, even less that the old EU server when they shut that down.\n\nThe PVE UE server is a little better populated than the PVP server BUT, they "The DEV'S" made all the PVE mobs 3x Tougher so 3x the hit points then they have on the PVP server. Thus making it impossible to get anywhere on that server unless you are grouped up or have level 5 weapons and armor and are High level with max hit points. They "the DEV'S" say well you get 3x exp points now for a kill BUT it also now takes 3x as many bullets to kill them now. AND only bases have CHEAPER ammo and all bases are controlled by Russian clans so  once again the English players are screwed over and have to pay top rubies for ammo. The Russian Clans control entire map and all bases so there is no hope EVER for any English Clan the "Outsiders" to control one. Most of the Russian player base transfered here from the old EU server they were all level 25+ and that was almost a year ago.\n\nOverall the game is a FAIL on steam and the western playerbase ie "America" has left this game alone, good move as they the "DEV"S" don't give a s h i t about US anyway. Both servers are having the same problems of a very small player base and even a SMALLER playerbase of English only players as I have played 12 days now and NEVER seen but 1 on the PVP server and a few more on the PVE server.","June 26, 2015","false","253.5"," 961 of 1,033 people (93%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","93","961","1","71","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bamul/recommended/316390/","Bamul","Zbójnik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bamul/","96 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nENGLISH REVIEW\n\nYears ago work began on the MMORPS “Stalker-Online”, which – heavily inspired by the world created in GSC Game World’s cult classic “S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl” – sought to recreate that world in a multiplayer environment. For reasons unknown to me, a dispute broke out between two groups in the studio which worked on Stalker-Online. It was divided into two teams and both of them retained the rights for the project, but only one holds ownership of its name. Hence we now have two productions: Stalker-Online and “sZone-Online”, which are almost identical and to this day remain very similar to the closed beta of the first project from 2010.\n\nTheir graphics resemble an early alpha version of Shadow of Chernobyl, which by today’s standards is even more dated and stings the eyes with its ugliness. Nevertheless, the Eastern European style is accurately portrayed through the abandoned housing estates and other such Chernobylesque locations in-game, which should please fans of the original Stalker, though some more music and sounds would be nice. Unfortunately the performance of sZone-Online is awful even on good computers – with a GTX 770, an i5-3350P and 8 GB of RAM, the frame rate on my PC was swinging from 20 to 80 frames per second in the most random of situations, which sometimes caused slight nausea and hampered fighting. There are also crashes and lag, even when you have a good connection.\n\nThe gameplay is painful. Combat is exceptionally unfair and unrealistically designed; using firearms feels unsatisfying, enemies function like so-called “mobs” from ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes (meaning they can sometimes notice you out of nowhere and attack you in swarms), and when you die you must wait 30 seconds before your character can get up again – of course with a minimal amount of health points – in the same dangerous area… The waiting time increases with each death. Alternatively you can respawn at the nearest stalker base (and the maps are large), but by choosing this option you risk losing precious items from your inventory.\n\nNormally I don’t complain about rare ammo in games (quite the opposite), but in sZone – where it’s possible to die so easily, in such unforeseen circumstances and lose so much – it really is irritating. This is not S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Metro 2033, where you can triumph over numerous enemies without wasting mass quantities of ammunition thanks to your own skill. In sZone-Online your character moves like a tank with the durability of a piece of toilet paper and all your efforts are liable to incongruous MMORPG gameplay elements, many bugs and the aforementioned terrible frame rate. Improving character skills and acquiring useful gear also takes an annoying amount of time.\n\nHowever, when you do find yourself alone after nightfall in the wilderness, far from any NPC camps and hours past the starting areas of the game… then you’ll start to feel that atmosphere. You feel vulnerable and endangered. When interaction between players comes into play, who may be stalkers in a similar situation and become your comrades or turn out to be simple bandits, sZone becomes much more interesting.\n\nIn conclusion: sZone draws too much from traditional MMORPGs – boring quests, no engaging story, microtransactions and gameplay that rewards “grinding” as opposed to skill (which is at odds with the first-person shooter combat model). Furthermore, the game is barely evolving and has very shady roots… This whole project is based on plagiarism. Cybertime System is not the first developer to try to capitalise on fans of GSC Game World’s works. Even though in sZone you can experience a few amazing moments, overall it is a badly created game that will never reach its potential due to deep contradictions in its design.\n\n---\n\nPOLSKA RECENZJA\n\nLata temu zaczęto pracę nad MMORPS „Stalker-Online”, która – mocno zainspirowana światem stworzonym przez GSC Game World w kultowej grze „S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Cień Czarnobyla” – miała na celu odtworzenie tegoż świata w trybie wieloosobowym. Z niewiadomych mi powodów doszło do sporu między dwoma grupami w studiu, które zajmowało się tworzeniem Stalker-Online. Podzieliło się ono na dwa zespoły i oba z nich zatrzymały prawo do projektu, ale tylko jeden do jego nazwy. W taki sposób mamy teraz dwie produkcje: Stalker-Online i „sZone-Online”, które do dziś są niemalże identyczne i wciąż bardzo podobne do zamkniętej bety pierwszego projektu z 2010 roku.\n\nGrafika przypomina wczesną wersję alfa Cienia Czarnobyla, co na dzisiejsze standardy jest jeszcze bardziej przestarzałe i kłuje w oczy brzydotą. Niemniej jednak, ten wschodnioeuropejski styl jest trafnie odzwierciedlony przez opuszczone blokowiska i inne czarnobylskie lokacje w grze, co powinno spodobać się fanom oryginalnego Stalkera, chociaż przydałoby się trochę więcej muzyki i dźwięków. Niestety wydajność sZone-Online jest okropna nawet na dobrych komputerach – z GTX 770, i5-3350P i 8 GB RAMu, częstotliwość klatek huśtała się na moim pececie od 20 do 80 klatek na sekundę i to w kompletnie losowych sytuacjach, co momentami powodowało lekkie mdłości i mocno utrudniało bój. Są także krasze i lagi nawet, gdy ma się dobre połączenie.\n\nRozgrywka jest bolesna. Walka jest niezwykle podła i nierealistycznie zaprojektowana; strzelanie z broni palnej czuje się niesatysfakcjonujące, wrogowie funkcjonują jak tzw. „moby” z gier MMO (czyli czasem potrafią ciebie dostrzec znikąd i rzucić się na ciebie całym mrowiem), a gdy zginiesz musisz czekać 30 sekund zanim twoja postać będzie mogła znów wstać – oczywiście z minimalną ilością punktów życia – w tym samym niebezpiecznym miejscu… Czas czekania powiększa się z każdą śmiercią. Alternatywnie możesz odrodzić się od razu w najbliższej bazie stalkerów (a mapy są wielkie), ale wybierając tę opcję ryzykujesz utratę cennych przedmiotów ze swojego ekwipunku.\n\nNormalnie nie narzekam na rzadkość amunicji w grach (wręcz przeciwnie), lecz w sZone – gdzie można zginąć tak łatwo, w tak nieoczekiwanych okolicznościach i stracić tak wiele – jest to naprawdę irytujące. To nie S.T.A.L.K.E.R. czy Metro 2033, gdzie można zwyciężyć z licznymi wrogami bez marnowania masowych ilości amunicji dzięki własnym umiejętnościom. W sZone-Online twoja postać porusza się jak czołg z wytrzymałością kawałka papieru toaletowego a wszystkie twoje starania podlegają niepasującym elementom rozgrywki MMORPG, liczebnym błędom gry i wcześniej wspomnianej marnej wydajności. Polepszanie umiejętności postaci i zdobywanie przydatnego sprzętu także zajmuje denerwująco dużo czasu.\n\nNatomiast, gdy już znajdziesz się sam w dziczy po zmroku, daleko od najbliższego obozu NPCów i już kilka godzin po zwiedzeniu początkowych miejsc w grze… wtedy naprawdę zaczniesz czuć ten klimat. Czujesz się wrażliwy i zagrożony. Gdy w grę wchodzi interakcja między graczami, którzy mogą być stalkerami w podobnej sytuacji i stać się twoimi towarzyszami lub okazać się zwykłymi bandytami, sZone staje się dużo bardziej interesujące.\n\nPodsumowując: sZone za dużo czerpie z tradycyjnych MMORPGów – m.in. nudne zadania, brak wciągającej fabuły, mikropłatności i rozgrywkę, która nagradza za „grinding” a nie zręczność (co jest sprzeczne z modelem walki strzelanki pierwszoosobowej). Co więcej, gra prawie wcale się nie rozwija i ma bardzo podejrzane korzenie… Cały ten projekt jest oparty na plagiacie. Cybertime Studios to nie jedyny producent, który próbuje skapitalizować niedosyt fanów twórczości GSC Game World. Mimo że w sZone-Online można doświadczyć kilka niesamowitych chwil, ogólnie jest to źle stworzona gra, która nigdy nie osiągnie swojego potencjału ze względu na głębokie sprzeczności w tym, jak jest zaprojektowana.","December 6, 2015","false","12.4"," 266 of 290 people (92%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","92","266","290","23","12"

First of all, I'm russian and I know this game for years, so let me bring some vital information for you, because you probably don't know anything about this "masterpiece" =)\n\nThis game is a clone of original Stalker-Online project (it still exists and is much better that this one). This game was stolen by some developers and they decided to publish it asap to gain as much money as they can. But let me show you main problems:\n\n* Ugly FPS: 10-15 instead of 30-60 (in original Stalker Online).\n* Graphics (it's ugly here)\n* Server lags (I have 500ms ping on 160Mbps optical internet channel in Russia!!!)\n* "Waiting for authorization, please wait" is the only thing you will see for hours...\n* MoneyMaking. It means you are nothing without real money in this game. The only thing devs want is to take your money.\n* Ugly support: be ready to wait for days for answers on your claims...\n\nAnd much more... Don't be silly, just try to find original SO and compare ;)\n\n--\nСначала написал на своем мохнатом английском, т.к. нашим заморским друзьям сложнее искать объективную информацию...\n\nО да, я не видел этот отстой уже больше года и вот - всплыло. Я в общем-то знаком был с этой игрой. Для тех кто не в курсе, есть оригинальный проект - "Сталкер-Онлайн"  - он существует, отлично развивается в отличие от Szone, и сделан куда лучше этой поделки. Игры похожи, так как раньше это была одна команда, но ребята из Szone тупо своровали код и все наработки и сделали свой позорный клон (причем отлично врут про то, что это типо они владельцы - поищите в сети, документы есть)... Вот недавно увидил новость, что Szone вышла в стим, решил посмотреть, что же такого сделали, может неплохая игра-то? Но нет, все подтвердилось. В общем, смотрите сами...\n\nИз плюсов: какие-то новые системы прокачки (но если вникнуть - все тупо для отъема вашего бабла), вид от первого лица (который сделан тоже отстойно, лучше бы не делали вообще - это не контра...). Эти-то с натяжкой, но я хочу быть объективным.\n\nИз минусов: FPS (10-15 против 30-60 в СО), графика (ну тут сразу заметно, что в СО она в разы круче), лаги (у меня вот сейчас на этом стим-клиенте пинг 500мс при личном 160мбит оптоволокне в квартире!!!). Да я даже зайти в игру долго не мог из-за постоянного "Waiting for authorization, please wait"... Ах да, про донат забыл сказать - без большого количества реала вы ничто. Платить придется за все, иначе вас любой школьник нагнет не по разу. Я не жму деньги, просто тут это гипертрофировано (вы быстро поймете, что цель одна - отнять у вас бабло любой ценой).\n\nРезюме: если вы это прочитали, значит вам интересно и вы понимаете русский - не поленитесь, поищите в Яндексе оригинальный проект (Stalker-Online, ссылки нельзя постить) и не мучайте себя этой подделкой.\n\nPS: забавный момент - куча негативных отзывов тут пометили как позитивные ))))))","January 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 419 of 479 people (87%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","87","419","479","20","27"

That is fine, they wouldn't last long anyway. The game itself is actully pretty good when it works. It is unforgiving when it comes to dying, there is a MASSIVE amount of land to explore across several maps, and the gameplay is alright as long as you aren't dropping to 5 fps because of the memory leak. They managed to mostly capture the atmosphere of the STALKER games, but not 100%. My biggest complaint has to be with their moderators though, they seem to be completely inept and unable to even work on their own account system.\ntl:dr- The game is fine if you can deal with slow progression, but god help you if you have to submit a support ticket, they don't even speak English.\n\n-Edit\nBar none the worst game support I have ever tried to use.

Now, S-zone has a lot of "NOT RECOMMENDED" reviews. It is kind of funny and sad at the same time. 90% of those reviewers only have around 20 minutes of gameplay if not even that. OKAY SO: This is an early acces game, it has only been out for a few weeks and people are judging it too harshly. The tutorial (or the first 10-20 minutes of the game) seem to ♥♥♥♥ most people off for some reason. They keep saying "It's buggy, animations are bad, graphics are horrible, etc...". Those people probably have no idea what EARLY ACCESS means. It explains itself mostly so we got that out of the way. Gameplay isn't even that bad for an early acces game. Mechanics are OK, there is a great variety of quests and weapons. People with really weak PCs are saying that this game is bad and yes that is kind of true, if you have a horrible PC everyone's game will run bad. I don't want to insult anyone but im just pointing out the facts here. Your PC might go above MINIMUM settings but the game will still be lagging. Why? BECUASE ITS EARLY ACCESS. The optimization is not COMPLETE yet. So even people with MLG PRO 1337-360 NO SCOPE PCs will get some of those issues and they will surely be fixed soon. Now let's talk about the game after 10-20 minutes-it's simply great. It's like a poor man's DAYZ (if you're doing pvp). PVE mode is really fun with friends, quests are decently done. The only thing standing in your way is the early access optimization which akes the game have quite a few bugs. Storyline is well explained. Overall, if people give the game some time and not say "K GAME'S GRAPHICS SUCK, ANIMATIONS ARE BAD, I HATE IT.". I played for only 9 hours and I can say that this game is worth a try.","February 22, 2015","true","11.9"," 443 of 541 people (82%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","82","443","541","46","35"

Jumped into it and immediately felt that warm welcome of the Stalker appeal. The atmosphere is very immersive, and the dialogue (russian) has that unique sarcastic Stalker appeal with humorous twists. The shooting works and once you put a scope on your AK gets actually pretty fun. It is also super satisfying to finally find an artifact and sell it for large profits, especially since the zone makes you feel really vulnerable, with potential danger lurking around any corner.\n\nNow for the negatives: This game is utter ♥♥♥♥. It is poorly optimized, supper buggy and will literally lag every minute no matter of your system. Somehow I was able to overlook it for 25 hours even though there is a bug around every corner. Theoretically everything is there to make a great game: quests, interesting NPCs, tons of guns, PVP, crafting and levelling system.\n\nOnly THEY ♥♥♥♥ED UP THE LEVELLING SYSTEM. Once you gain the first easy couple of levels you realize a massive downside. To gain any perks that will actually help you with your chosen specialization (reduced gun wear, increased aiming, animal part gathering, etc), you basically need to put in an unrealistic amount of grinding work. For example to gain the 1st level perk for assault rifles as a warrior you must get 300 specialized points. 1 point = 46000xp. One quests gives you 300-500xp and killing mobs is under 100xp. Some quests do give a few thousands, but you'll run out of them long before you get a  1'000'000 experience points. Honestly, if you somehow have half a life time to put into levelling of this game just to get a SINGLE 1st LVL PERK, then I hope your grandkids can enjoy your work. After registering on the Russian forums, I found out this was already the formula in 2013, so I dont know what paint the devs have been sniffing for the last 2 years but they completely ruined the game. Oh and to top it all off, you can use real money to purchase in game items, but they have a limited amount of time for usage. Who does that, especically on a broken game. All in all ♥♥♥♥ this game and ♥♥♥♥ the devs for slapping the title Stalker on a piece of turd.","January 20","false","51.2"," 175 of 201 people (87%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","87","175","201","54","52"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hrothgarunblooded/recommended/316390/","hrothgarunblooded","Diet Sausage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hrothgarunblooded/","371 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is exactly how an online STALKER game should be. It needs work, but it nails the atmosphere and style which is unique to that universe.\n\nYour character is of no significance at all.  No world saving or god-slaying heroes here, just you and your crappy AK against hordes of mutants, deadly environmental anomalies, and fellow scavengers.  I'll run through what's good, what's bad, and what could be improved.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Atmosphere:  Mostly cloudy days running through abandoned towns, old factories and railway stations, with not much more than the sounds of nature to accompany you is in line with how STALKER is supposed to be.\n\n-PvP + PvE:  There aren't strict divisions between PvP and PvE;  rather, you can opt to turn on PvP at any time using an icon in the upper left, which will change the color of your name and render you vulnerable to other players' weapons.  PvP is automatically turned on, however, if the total worth of your inventory/gear exceeds a certain threshold, which I think is a great way to put you in the mindset of a scavenger among other scavengers - you don't want to have your most valuable stuff with you for too long and around too many people, lest they try to take it from you.  Killing other players within sight of town guards/NPC's will net you a negative reputation temporarily, meaning players who get too trigger happy find themselves losing out on certain conveniences for a time.  There's also a PvP arena with different modes similar to the multiplayer in the actual STALKER games, with rewards even for when you lose.\n\n-Quests:  There are an ungodly number of quests, and while they can be difficult, I've yet to run into more than one or two which explicitly required a team of people.  Rewards are usually shown before the quest is completed, meaning you can make more effective decisions about how to use your time, and you rarely get surprised with a bad reward for a hard quest.  Some involve a LOT of traveling, though, which can wear on you a bit.\n\n-Maps:  They're gigantic.  Lots of places to explore, with randomly-generated, respawning loot, as well as valuable artifacts if you choose to investigate anomalies.  It is not hard to make a lot of money outside of questing, if you learn where to look.\n\n-The Community:  It's weird to say this is good when the dominant quality of the community is indifference.  People don't seem to communicate much, and when they do it's usually very short and to the point, but it's so fitting with how STALKER works that I see it as a plus for the game.  You'll get used to aiming first and asking questions second, as you never know who might decide to pull the trigger and rob you.  And  yes, you can get robbed.  That said, helping people goes a long way, and you build trust more by actually doing something rather than talking to someone.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Sounds:  Sound quality is fairly basic, and some of it doesn't work consistently.  Music plays in some locations but is apparently so specific to a location that it just cuts out when you move.  Monsters make noise, but you can only really hear them when they're on you, meaning you could have a small horde of them chasing you and not actually know it until you've been gored and left for dead.  It's highly annoying sometimes when you're exploring only to be killed without so much as the sound of a footstep for warning.\n\n-Aggro distance:  Sometimes a monster sees you and comes after you in a way which totally makes sense.  Sometimes they show up almost out of nowhere and kill you in one hit.  Sometimes they kill you, leave, and when you respawn show up from some crazy distance away to gnaw on you again.  Combine that with the lack of audio indicating their presence, and you'll feel like you're getting cheap-shotted a LOT.  "Verliokas" are especially terrible about this - they make no noise, travel very quickly, and will aggro from insane distances in places where you can't see anything.\n\n-Graphics:  The graphics are dated and have some issues here and there.  Textures flicker, sometimes whole sections of the map won't load (you have to quit and restart to remedy that, I've found).  The aesthetic is spot on, it's more that it just looks old and the performance doesn't quite match what you'd expect from what you're seeing.  It performs smoothly for the most part, but some locations lag like crazy for reasons I can't grasp.\n\n-Stats and Mechanics:  It's not that things here are broken, more that there's little explanation as to how different things work, and the requirements for raising skills are crazy even when you specialize in something.  You spend experience points to get specialization points, which are then used to unlock skills, but the "exchange rate" for these can get insane quickly.  The upshot is that you receive EXP for practically everything you do (you can gain quite a lot by opening a rare loot box or by eating a large meal early on), but it doesn't feel like it means much when you can't use it for anything for a looooong time.\n\n-Pay-to-Win:  While the paid items usually have a time limit, their being available at all means PvP in some areas is ridiculous without paid gear.  PvE doesn't suffer much from this, as even with some of the best gear you can still get completely wrecked if you're not paying attention, but if you're big on the arena, you'll be investing some real money to stand a fighting chance.  I will say though, in comparison to a lot of other pay-to-play schemes, you do get a lot for what you buy.  Things like experience and stat buffs are very cheap (a 2-hour EXP rate buff is 6 cents, for example), and almost all of the paid gear has a limited time of use.  Permanent benefits come more in how you can accumulate different items and sell them off for lots of in-game money, which while not exactly the best, could be (and is, in many p2p schemes) worse.\n\n\nOverall:  It's worth it if you're a big fan of STALKER.  If you're not, you'll find this to be a difficult game that's really tough on you from the get-go, without much in the way of a payoff until a long ways into it.  You do NOT need to pay anything to get far - if you are adventurous and remember to mark valuable spots on your map, you can easily make money to get good gear without ever dropping a cent.  Outside of the arena, PvP is done in a way which I think suits the type of game extremely well, where your personal wealth affects others' perception of you as well as having PvP mode as a punishment for shooting people in major areas.  It fits, and that's what I think is most important - Szone FEELS like STALKER, and STALKER was all about feeling like you were in a weird place.\n\nFeedback:  Sounds for creatures would be tremendously helpful and add to the realism a lot.  While animals and mutants do make noise, they need to be heard from a greater distance, if only because it's ridiculous that a bunch of them can gang up on you without you hearing anything.  Very, VERY annoying.  Ambient audio and music needs work too, as they're not  very consistent in, well, being present.  A better explanation of mechanics, via a more comprehensive guide than the forums would be great too, as there's a lot of numbers but not a lot of info as to what they really mean (one assumes higher = better, but one also wants to know by how much different amounts affect things).","May 29, 2015","true","189.2"," 166 of 192 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","166","192","9","0"

You can download and play it for free right off their website here (http://szone-online.net/)\n\nIf you paid for this game, you should ask for a refund in Steam Customer Support and tell them about this.\n\nEdit: Specifically, it's about putting it up as a paid game to try to circumvent steam F2P microtransaction fees on the devs - so that Valve doesn't get their cut.  For the people who have the game: When you try to make a microtransaction purchase in-game, does it take you to the steam page?  It doesn't.

It's environment mimicks that of the STALKER franchise. The gameplay is a bit similar to DayZ (though not exactly), and it has some heavy MMORPG aspects.\n\nMany of the "poor" reviews I'm seeing on here are from a lack of understanding of the game.\n\nFirst: Tips for newbies\n\n1. Talk to Sour and Blacksmith. They will give you free weapons and some rewarding quests\n\n2. Push N to hide other players\n\n3. Push F to talk to NPCs. Translations have improved immensely. Be sure to read the quest dialogue. Often it gives you more info on what needs to be done then the journal\n\n4. The area you first come to is the tutorial city.\n\n5. The FPS has improved but large populations may change it\n\n6. We have three servers. EU PvP, PvE, and US PvP. Their locations are obvious and each will determine your ping and what the majority of players speak in terms of language\n\n7. When I played a lot about a year-year and a half ago, there was open world PvP. This caused a lot of problems. People would shut down entire towns with snipers and such, mass DM. As a result, it appears they've changed it. I will update this mroe as I learn the new system. There is also clan wars PvP and Arena PvP.\n\n8. Clans can go to war with one another and capture territories on the second map you visit.\n\n9. Yes there are anomalies and artifacts.\n\n10. The game can be very difficult. Take your time. The key skills to doing well in this game is taking things slow, planning, accuracy, and socializing.\n\n11. Push I to open inventory, U to open character, K to see your skills, and J to see your current quests\n\n12. There are still some things in Russian. It has improved immensely, but it isn't uncommon to see something you don't understand.\n\n13. To get out of the starter city the NPC named Duchonik (if that's how you spell) at the Police Station near the kindergarden gate will start a quest chain. Leaving via this way will side you with the military and their allies in terms of reputation you get. The reputation effects is minimal so you don't have to worry about this too much. The other way is to talk to Courier and do his chain at the north settlement in the city. This one sides more with the STALKERs/underground.\n\nOverall I give the game a 8/10. They fixed a lot of issues with the pings, but graphics are still meh. The game is very challenging and time consuming. A lot of people have compared its design to something that of early 2000s MMOs, before the "WoW formula" became so frequent.\n\nEDIT: UPDATED REVIEW to give better tips","January 11, 2015","true","104.6"," 167 of 217 people (77%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","77","167","217","15","0"

Please dont play it, there are many other great games with appocalyptic setting which are definitely better than this piece of scrap","June 29, 2015","false","2.0"," 90 of 109 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","90","109","15","2"

However after playing the game for an hour or so and getting past the horrible intro to the game, I started to have fun. While it is not tthe best game out there, it is certainly not the worst. I wasn't sure why they were charging for a f2p game but I realised that in game, you get 100 IRL currency and a "bond" that can be cashed in for some basic gear. Now a lot of people ask if this is pay to win, not at all. you can buy in game items with IRL money, but they only last a limited time. But this is the nice part, you can earn these items and weapons by simply playing and finding/looting the items in game, and they will last forever.\n\nSUMMED UP-\n\nPay To Win?\nA- No, you can buy items that last a limited time. However you may earn them in game and stay forever.\n\nWhy Pay For A Free Game?\nYou get in game currency that you would otherwise have to pay for IRL anyways, this way you pay less than usual and get to support the dev's. It is early access as well.\n\nIs This Even Fun?\nIn the beggining, not at all. But I dragged on about an hour, and it suddenly became fun! After completing the horrible intro, you are free to explore and do quests, level up, and earn skills. Just like any other MMORPG. But this is in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R world and has a great community.\n\nIs the world PVP?\nNo, there are arenas ment for PVP as well as the "wild".\n\nWhat Is The Wild?\nThe wild is a massive part of the world where pvp is enabled and anyone can kill, killing a player has its negatives and posotives. Many players choose to ignore others and get on there merry ways. This makes travelling to foreign lands risky yet exciting. You will not only have to fear the environment, and wildlife, but also "Bandits". There are safe zones spread throughout the wild to protect you from such people, and safely trade your goods.\n\nKOS? (Kill On Site)\nFrom what I have seen, No. Players love working together in this game and the community is great. The game has a lot of negative aspects to killing others, such as being labeled a name such as "Murderer" And this will cause players to avoid you and not trade with you. There are many reasons why people do not kill on site.\n\nDo I Recommend This?\nFor 1$, Yes. For 10$? Not at this state. This is a F2P game after all. The game is very unpolished but well worth a dollar, especially for S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans.","January 3, 2015","true","3.8"," 147 of 200 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","147","200","2","5"

Once you get out of the first map it's more interesting.\n\nUnfortunately the developers are not responsive and have a tendency to ban people from the discussion forums and the game for pointing out the serious issues they refuse to address, which are :\n\nThe chat moderators are people that play the game and constantly provoke people.  This is considered extremely unprofessional anywhere else but in this game.  The chat moderators will harass people until they say something that is considered a chat bannable offense.  Complaints about this kind of set up they entirely ignore.\n\nThe rampant, obvious, cheating.  It's very clear that people cheat in this game and the developers not only allow it, they encourage it.  They actually told some of the most obvious cheaters that they had turned off the anti-cheat system.  Which brings me to the big final huge minus about this game.\n\nThe developers constantly lie.  They claimed that the anti-cheat system had been running all along, then admitted later that they had turned it off, yet told some of the worst offenders it was turned off, encouraging them to cheat.  The developers also banned people who did not cheat for several days, and accused people who had not cheated of cheating, and refused to apologize or compensate them in any way.\n\nOverall this is the most negative gaming experience I have ever had.  I do not recommend sZone, primarily because they defraud the players by implying you have any chance of fair PVP play, if you would just BUY some better gear.  Then you buy that gear and discover rapidly that it doesn't matter; the developers have people playing the game that they know cheat for the expressed purpose of conning you into spending money on something that is of almost no use.\n\nRead through the complaints and look at the hours people have put into this game.  Any other serious game developer really cares about the people who are playing the game the most, they actually value their input.  sZone does not.\n","December 21, 2015","false","938.2"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","48","52","3","5"

Alright fair enough, the game has some bugs on release. So I logged in, the game has some weird camera feel to it, it's like my FoV is 50 and there's headbob when you sit still. The game runs... okay I guess for what it looks like and being a mmo. I started a quest, got a gun, and had some of the most awkward feeling gun combat ever. I've played f2p CS knock offs that felt more natural. No iron sights, gun accuracy is random, and for some reason you have a loading bar pop up for every interaction. Want to switch guns? Here's a loading bar even though you already have the other gun out.\n\nI started pelting homeless npcs with rocks, until another player came by and we had a rock fight. Which was interrupted by some random dude clipping through the ground with only his neck and head visible. I then wandered for a bit, found some NPC guards who walked like they ♥♥♥♥ themselves all the way down to the legs.

Does it tell you how to do this? NO. It's more like: " HERE'S YOUR AK, STFU!" In the tutorial, the game gives you a quest to find a artifact.

Kinda feels like a very very very VERY early product rather than something thats been out for years now.\n\nPay no attention to the hours i've spent on it - i'm just weird like that.\n\n*Edit* alright its been mentioned that I should probably clarify that - I insanely like survival/apocalyptic games and any game that lets me hide in some bushes spying on some noobs before rushing out - screaming and spraying a machine gun for no reason other than ♥♥♥♥♥ 'n giggles is worth at least some of my time. But the game handles it rather terribly with unpolished gameplay, bugs up the goddam ♥♥♥, and a world that feels empty and devoid of life (although that might be something of the point - however if you need to sacrifice gameplay for story you should always head back to the drawing board to see where things went wrong IMO).\n\nMaybe I can recomend it to anyone looking for a real hardcore MMO type deal since pretty much all enemies can quickly kill you if you arn't paying attention, PVP is allowed in all places except select safezones, invisible anomalies can insta-kill you, and (for the most part) the game leaves you to figure out things for yourself.\n\nHowever there is a vast difference between a simulation and a video game for me and I vastly prefer the second, but this feels more like the first. Forgive me for becoming complacent but I would like to know why the guy I need to talk to for my quest is simply telling me to sod off rather than what I need to do to win his favour and instead I just wander off - mindlessly completing quests and killing monsters in the area hoping he eventually notices me like a disaproving father.","January 7","false","102.3"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","77","67","87","36","4"

Usually we would have clans recruiting newbies to help them progress better in the game,by giving them advice,giving them free items and money,when there was absolutely no English Translation,and I'm talking about the non-steam versions of this,where all of it was just Russian. The gameplay demands tolerance and patience,as there are bugs,occasinal lag but not that much,but then there's the worse part,bandits. Guys who camp and kill others on sight,although in the game,it's very punishable. Normally it's uncommon for such things to happen,but then if you're in a clan,it could get worse. Some clans play for the PvP usually,and there are plenty of them,unfortunately. I'm not that type of person,there are also other clans who are neutral or are trying to fight against the KoS'ing regularly. Here,pro's usually are the ones who know how this game works,people like me that played this game when it was in Russian. The bugs and lag were very problematic before,but I asure you,this new version will have it sorted,if only people would put up a bit more patience with this game like I did,then they might discover how fun it actually is.

The mutants you fight are extremely aggressive and hard hitting...ie. you won't be running thru a small pack of mutant dogs and live to see the other side. The game is centered around exploring large maps with danger constantly at your elbow with minimal resources and living to tell the tales\n\nI've been playing about a week and close to hitting lvl 11, it's been a blast but I'm an old-school player that enjoys a real challenge in the games I play. This game is NOT easy-mode, if you try to Rambo it you'll get chewed up and spit out.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good for an open world game, certainly not the best but still decent. Even though its in Beta with many things needing more polish it's still very playable.\n\nOne thing i recommend is to do the tutorial, it will give you more ammo right away...which you're going to need.\n\nTLDR Very fun game if you're looking for an open world survival shooter that's a real challenge, fighting mutants of all sorts and like to explore...if you want an easy-mode game [like most games are] then this isnt for you.","September 19, 2015","true","762.8"," 79 of 109 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","79","109","6","0"

I am not 100% if global PvP is still around or not but if it is people will shoot you randomly just because your not in a clan. and if your in a clan enemy clans just shoot you because they can or feel like it with no bad side effect for straight up murder; and the player base are not as friendly as they used to be. alot are what some people call "♥♥♥♥♥" or "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s" and before on steam the remaining players were about 50-80players with big clans being WAY TO OVERLY SERIOUS. THEY GET SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥ OFF OVER THE SMALLEST THINGS. The devs only seem to want money with all of the UNNEEDED WIPES. wanting money intially on steam to even play the free to play game that was always free even years ago from the main site itself. Also back then there has been several incidences of admin abuse and nothing was done about it for most of them. one of the admins was out of control banned several people for no good reason. also people who when against him durring clan wars. it's about putting it up as a paid game to try to circumvent steam F2P microtransaction fees on the devs - so that Valve doesn't get their cut. For the people who have the game: When you try to make a microtransaction purchase in-game, does it take you to the steam page? It doesn't.\n\nin summary: - low player base\n- patches/"improvements" the devs did ruined the game\n- Pay to Win\n- no more banks (execpt if you pay in game money now which is stupid or go back to map 1)\n- no more decent way to help new players get to places and items without help from a MUCH MUCH higher geared player\n- overall alot of the game is not translated properly\n- very buggy even after over 5 years of release and devlopment.\n- past admin abuse.\n- microtransactions is not linked with steam as well.\n\naddition with other user information:\nover the last 1,5 years there was no real content added to szone. the devs only drainnig it via the golden rubel shop\nszone online was also taken off steam TWICE! YES TWO TIMES because of issues. what other game has had that happen. oh. warZ (infestation survivor stories). known to promise alot of ♥♥♥♥ and still hasn't delievered years after.\n\nedit: ALSO IF YOU HAVE AN OLD ACCOUNT YOU CAN'T LINK OR USE WITH STEAM ACCOUNT SO GOD DAMN BROKEN THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE","January 11, 2015","false","0.9"," 81 of 114 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","81","114","3","18"

For example when you reload the AK-47 it makes no sound at all\n-Combat is ♥♥♥♥ as the enemies do not move smoothly at all but warp around\n-Interacting with your equipment is ♥♥♥♥.

SZone is something between a FPS and MMO and doesn't do any of it particularly good.\n\nThe graphics are not even on par with Stalker-COP which is like ancient by this time. No animations for reloading, swapping weapons or aiming, instead you get a progress bar. NPCs have different skins but little in terms of animations. All lined next to each other is convenient but doesn't build any atmosphere. Buildings have loads of texture seams and projection errors which tells me not even the 3D artists gave a ♥♥♥♥.\nLag is a problem. The second enemy I encountered was already jerking around. This also makes menus unresponsive at times. I actually dropped my starting AK while dragging it into my hotbar because of that.\nThe quests will give you hints instead of a clearly visible objective on the map (I like). It forces some exploration and research but the writing isn't engaging at all. Maybe they tried but again they failed.\nThe atmosphere is not existant. It's like riding a spooky ride at an amusement park with every animatronic shut down and the lights turned on. Absolutely no sign of the mysterious and dangerous Zone except some sub-par fog effect.\n\nVery interesting was the note in my inventory: "Not longer used in game". Turned out I could have exchanged it for some basic starter gear previously. This no longer works and all the game does is tell you "no resources" when you try. Why is the item still there? Why is the exchange option still there? Why is there NO CLEAR indication why it doesn't work? Why do I have to spend more time figuring out if something is a bug or a feature than figuring out what is happening in the game world?\n\nIn 24 minutes I obviously didn't make it past the starting zone, but why would I want to? There is nothing in the starting zone I'd consider even remotely polished. If they don't put effort in ensuring a decent first impression, sucking new players in, I can only assume the rest will be even worse. Given all the problems Stalker had and this is made by part of the same team I don't even want to think about it.\n\nIf you want to troll a small player base in a game that is utter crap OR you never played any good game before, this is for you.\n\nEDIT: Actually I did not drop the AK by accident. Switching to it via the hotkeys simply does not work.\nThis game has been developed for years and such basic thing so not work.

Firstly I will write down a short list of the Pros/Cons, and if it is worth the game time.\n\nNow as you are aware, S.T.A.L.K.E.R Is quite a good game, if you have played Chernobly or Clear sky, then you may know the story already. sZone-Online is a more MMORPG style game based on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R Series, but capable of building your character more and develop him, the games were great, this however brings out a all new meaning to "Are you ready to face the zone, Stalker?" Experience.\n\nPRO's\n- It is Free-to-play\n- It has quite a lot of content already\n- Follows a basic story line, features English and Russian\n- The economy in my opinion works out quite fine\n- A lot to do.\n- Contols are easy to manage\n- PvP Arena, and PVE Sessions.\n\nCON's\n- There are parts in the game were it features only in russian, e.g. some quests. But they will probebly fix it up\n- Graphics are not the best, but doesnt mean the game is bad\n- A couple of bugs which relate to the NPC's or having your character vanish for a moment, this can also relate too walls you can see through in PVP.\n- NPC's tend to glitch out, meaning their shadows show up near you when you are attacked.\n- You seem to get kicked from the game for standing around only for a couple of minutes.\n\nNow I know a lot of people might suggest this game is crap, everyone has a opinion and everyone prefers something else.\n\nResult:\nThe game is quite fun, it is boring at the start, but once you get to the second stage you begin to earn more items and rubles the more you do, I earned at least 7 Thousand rubles in just a hour, and managed to get myself some decent amount of stuff. Items may look expensive but they are not, following from the games the good stuff are one of the most expensive pricey pickens you may encounter, but with the amount you get you can easily collect some interesting things.\nArti's produce some good quality Currency if you find what you are looking for, even though some items have a Day limit on them, there are quite a lot of good items that do not, so really it is a WIN/WIN situation.\n\nMy suggestion: Take your time, read the dialoge if you can, it takes time to get used to it. But once you start to spend another hour on it, you will know it is worth it. It may be free-to-play, but I noticed a lot of items are balanced and how they should be placed. PVP matches you do not really encounter a man with a OP gun, this time it is your skill, not the weapon. So I thank you for reading this, and hope it will change your mind on the game.","February 5, 2015","true","11.8"," 200 of 321 people (62%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","62","200","321","38","10"

When you kill a rat 10 meters away for example it would die 2 seconds later, feels odd. I played it for about 5 hours and coped with the imperfections.\n\nPlus and cons :\n\nHas a big open world with many buildings to enter although further along the way many buildings interiors were shut     ( like flats). I like the survival to be as real as can be. Enter all buildings find dirty rats and vreepers everywehere whatever.\n\nMobs re popping is in some places immediate which ( with aggressive mobs) leads often to death after clearing a spot.\n\nWeapons sounds are off, reminds me of the pop guns back in my childhood.\n\nStats, detoriation of gear, levelling and crafting seem solid though. Maps are looking good, mobs are ok for an MMO style game.\n\nConclusion :\n\nThis is the sort of game we post apocalyptic game likers would like to have, fix the lagg ( Shoot lagg) and spawning , also quests are too many and too many daily like based which is neverending and chaotic to many players ( including me). Also the quests aren't always very clear on what to do as are the NPC quest givers ( from players). How many times i clicked a player thinking this was a NPC to get the message " would you like to trade with ......". All in all great potential, and free to try ;).

when you get in range to aquire the artifact you get to punch in a random 5 number sequence in as many seconds, and ofc you dont know what the next number is until after you have pressed the previous one. using it drains batteries so unless you wanna run around with more electricity on you than megavolt you better be accurate and hope latency doesent screw you over.\n\nand another thing, the graphics, uuuuugly, werent good when they started out and no signs of improvement now years and years later, good news for anyone who wants to play it using a calculator as gpu but bad news for people(like me) who appreciated the visuals in the stalker games and cant help comparing szone to them even though its terribly insulting to them.\n\nand last but not least, its p2w, you can buy fake money at horrible exchange rates as is standard among mobile apps, and for that money you can buy weapons and armor.\n\nso having seen no improvements in about 2 years among other atrocities this POS can go to hell","February 10, 2015","false","9.9"," 57 of 86 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","57","86","7","0"

Now however It's just become a complete waste of time and source of frustration.\n\nThe game is now split between PvE and PvP.  You can only choose one mode (before these modes we're combined - which was much better in my opinion).\n\nYou mostly get shot from behind by clan players with much more powerful guns than you have, in much more powerful suits and armours - there is no real fighting back if you are on your own.  You have to join a clan, which is hard considering they have something against English speaking people and prefer shooting you first and shoot you again if you get up or come back.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game isn't that though. I'ts the boars...  They are very fast, very strong and always seem to attack in hoardes.  They also like attacking you from behind like the clans do.  They obviously adopted that style from pigs.  It's happened many times where you are just mobbed by a whole bunch of boars and the more you try and kill or clear them from the area - the more you keep dying, waiting to "get up" only to be killed from the newly spawned hoard of boars.  You just can't win in this game, because the boars are weak mutants.  The stronger stuff is even more impossible to deal with.\n\nI play games to have fun and enjoy myself.  This game has been nothing but a frustrating grind that I was willing see through, but the changes made it even harder now where I don't see any point in trying to do any of it.","March 19","false","413.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","19","22","4","2"

Knutsak","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961097148/","71 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n\nNumber one I am not an uber pvp master.  But I have played allot of games over many years and never felt I had to vent about any other game as strongly before I entered the S Zone.\nI usually believe that most of the sniveling and whining about balance and cheating in pvp games are usually caused by younger people used to getting trophies for participation, the same ones who have  RTFM/L2P issues,  or who don't want to put in any effort in order to get the cool stuff.  And effort is a big thing in this game,  nothing comes from the zone without a struggle.  The one thing I first got hooked on was having to figure it all out myself,  from navigating a largly unmarked map to what the NPC's words really meant before they were translated to english. It was really fun,  I have always  enjoyed a challenging game.\n\nAbout RTFM, forget about it. The manual is composed largly of myth,  like the zone itself. Even the devs themselves reach mythic proportions in S Zone,  some say that they even play on the PVP server,  racking up extraordinary kill ratios while observing and assuring balance. I cannot say myself that cheating or the devs padding stats does exist in this game, and would like to believe otherwise. But whether it does or not,  the PVP aspect is broken to the point me losing interest fast.\n\nI particularly find it annoying that my rifle (cost $4.00 for 30 days) can dispatch charging boar with ease from 50-100 meters,  but trying to hit certain other  players  at half that range results in 25% hits or less.  Even the damage difference is painfully confusing,  I can hit an enemy with 6-8 times fairly regular with 7.62X51,  sometimes even up to 10 making the mark,  and in turn be killed by 4 rounds from same enemy. WTF?  Granted I am probably more easy to kill than most due to the fact that every weapon I have used seems to have a substantial  accuracy penalty when not stationary and/or in crouch,  as well as my reluctance to flit around like some sort of harlequin ninja doing a twitchy representation of Swan Lake.  While I am on the subject of ninja ballerinas,  they also seem to be able to hit me unerringly while running,  jumping,  doing pirouettes,  sometimes causing their bullets to bend around corners.  The stuff of legends indeed. FPS games where an advantage,  as opposed to a penalty,  is given to those who spam the space bar seem rather dated and silly,  to me anyway.\n\nNow granted,  I am only lvl 18 as opposed to the cap of 30,  and no doubt several million experience points allocated to armor,  weapon, health/stamina recovery etc behind most players. But come on,  give a guy a break once in awhile,  I mean three 7.62 nato to the head should at least slow a man down one would think,  no matter what helmet he has on.  At least blur his vision a bit.\n\nThe kill ratio of some of these "oober" players is the stuff of legend.  Maybe it is because they have spent too much time in the zone,  allocating mass quantities of exp to their stats,  carrying around beneficial artifacts,  using gold weapons and armor,  fine,  understandable.  But 10-12 clan members being prevented from taking a base by 1 or 2 enemies with all the guards down is kind of difficult to swallow.  Since I play a medic,  I do try to avoid unwanted attention sneaking around  in order to revive my teammates,  so I probably don't die nearly as much as someone assaulting the flags,  but even then some of these players  have amassed 25-30 or more kills on me,  fine I suck and am underequipped. But since I have started watching gameplay replays,  some of these same players seem to get pretty regular 15 or 20 to one K/D. While being outnumbered 6 to 1.  Or more. I have spent almost 300hrs on my main character,  if at just over half level cap all I can expect is getting a 1:30 K/D  what is the point. I heard a wise man once say "the  sun shines on even an ugly dog's ♥♥♥ once in awhile".\n\nThere is lag.  Lots of it. More lag when certain players are close to you. Still more when they shoot at you. You get two or three of these particular un-named enemies shooting at you and it stacks, what a great buff. Some enemies even make me lag when it is me shooting at them,  turning my screen to a slideshow,  while being riddled by laser guided bullets.\n\nYeah I think it is almost over for me.  I really wanted it to work,  but it has almost reached the point of continued playtime equaling insanity.  Good Luck fellow Stalkers.\n\n","December 21, 2015","false","402.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

There's no quick fix or simple tweak here; it needs a substantial overhaul. The content comes at you so fast that it can be overwhelming and there's very little information available on the game in English. It took me several hours just to figure out how you get more ammo or how to sell my loot. (btw DEVS, an open auction house in the starter area could really help with the new player experience). There are a lot of different sandbox-type activities (metal detectors for mining, animal skinning, "artifact" treasure hunting, etc), but they're limited by annoying in-game mechanics. For example, you need a hunting knife to, say, turn a stick into a useful tool, but you're limited to 1 or 2 knives per day. If you're very patient and you really enjoy figuring things out on your own in a wasteland/fallout type setting, you might enjoy it, but overall the quests are often frustrating and unclear, the business model makes no sense (you buy items from the cash shop which last only for a limited time), and it quickly becomes clear that the game hasn't yet been able to foster any sort of English-speaking player base, so you're going to be going it alone.","September 29, 2015","false","14.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","24","33","3","0"

Yes I have an awesome 100mb super speed $100 a month just for internet. All my other games never lag. This game would be alot better if you didn't have to spend your whole weekend just to find out you didn't even get any closer to the next lvl. I have wasted 32 hrs playing just to finally get 1 lvl for health up. It cost 64k points to lvl 1. and the same for everything else. I am VERY disapointed. If they would give more points ok a LOT more points and reduce the experience to the next lvl A LOT less I would probably play it.

Using the menus is a chore.  The game controls like a bad N64 shooter slicked up on astroglide.  It's sort of like Fallout if you removed all the gameplay, all the humor, all the interactivity, and all the polish.

I really do. But its almost as if they tried to make it suck. The game could have potential.\nSadly they game lacks depth. The world is flat. PLaces that should be flat are wonky and scrambled. Places that should have hills or streams or anything are flat. Characters have poor animation. Sound packs are tin like and sound like they were recorded in a drywall room with a logitec mic.Textures themselves are almost like they scrolled around the web for texture packs and mixed a jumble of them together. some buildings have great texture skins to them others seem like they are ripped from a ps1 game. Chatacters speak russian but their text is in broken english. Not broken english like a russian who does not speak english well broken, broken like insane spelling mistakes. Horrid use of words. "there" in use of "their" in some cases, etc etc. Navigating is horrid. The minimap is not accurate. Sometimes where there should be a house is a street. where there is a street there is a house. 'SOME" buildings you can enter, most cant. instead of proper map limits there are fences EVERYWHERE. enemy are in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clusters, one little spot will ahve like 30 dogs in it. 20 feet away might be 30 rats etc etc. its almost like they randomly set spawn flags in an editor and thats that. Enemy ideas are horrid as well. I can see dogs, even rats. but there are giant spiders, creepy little goblin things they call "brownies". in all the time I played I had not seen a single human enemy. clipping is a horrid issue as well.\n\nAll in all It had horrid presentation. map was bad, sound was bad, runs bad, I will keep up with it in the hopes they update it.

I have 900 or so hours on steam and even played before steam release. I have traveled the sands of gamedom and this is the only game that scratches the stalker itch. Sorry in advance for spelling and grammer errors.\n\nFirst off to the guys claiming its a terrible  clone. If this is a "clone" why arent the other games on steam? Most of the negative reviews are from scrubs that did not give the game a chance or expect the super kawai, ♥♥♥ circle of tickling, ez mode type of game. The guides on steam can help if you get frustrated or dont like to figure things out on your own. Ok now to the review.\n\nI guess like others I will break it down into a pros and cons list. For me, this is what stands out.\n\nPro\n\nThe atmoshpere is great. I love travelling through the zone. You have to figure out your own paths around the maps. I run my graphics on high setting and get around 45-72 fps, I am playing on and older MSI GT 70 OD laptop my perfromance is decent except for a few issues.\n\nI like the way that clases are set up. Any class can be resonably good at anything. However, classes are specialized. As a druid I can get to tier 4 of assult rifle skills, but only fighter/assualter types will reach tier 6 of assualt rifle skills. However, as a druid I can get to tier 6 in medicine; I can get rid of serious wounds in the field.\n\nArtifact hunting. This is just plain fun. It is a very high risk, high reward activity. You do not simply run around picking them up tanking the anomaly damage. You need to use the Magnetic Grib Device and pull them out.  Throwing stones to get the anomalies to "show" can also get the attention of uhm ... well mutants of all kinds. Again this is a high risk, high reward.\n\nCrating/Barter. This is a in depth and evolving system. Almost everything you find has a use at some point. I dont have a crafter so there is loads I dont know, out side of medical crafting.\n\nDifficulty. Many people dont like this this game becuase it is too difficult. I like a challange. I dont know what else to say. Sure I sometimes rage quite after getting bounced in two anomalies and landing in another to be stuck.\n\nCool events. They do ingame/store/face book events.  The time difference can make comunication with devs and community organizers a pain. You can win. I won a facebook event and got a bunch of good injectors for my clan.\n\nPvP.  Base and fortifacation fights are enjoyable , most of the time. The ability to barter at a base makes controlling one important.  Running into enemies in the zone is exiting, the fights can be a rush. Fighting for areas like conductor spawns, swamps, wastelands can be super fun  The international community makes pvp politics exciting. If you are into that sort of thing.\n\nName and shame. Aimbotters list are published.  I love the tears and derps.\n\n90 % of the gr/web store items can be obtianed in game. Its not easy and requires some investment.\n\nCons\nPerformance. This is an issue. I have to restart my client after a coupe of hours or when switching to a large map (like caravan). Some times objects, textures, sprites just disapear. This can make gathering items more frustranting and dangerous than it needs to be. Some areas are worse then others.. I am looking at you brutor cave.\n\nWeapon balance. There are many and many guns that just plain suck. Snipers and assualt rifles for pvp. Shotguns for pve.  AK model assualt rifles are the end all be all. The Barrett sniper rifle is just insanely difficult to get. Jackhammer is the pve gun of choice.  As a druid, I use ak 107, and am working on the skill to use level 5 class weapons (take 10 mill exp).\n\nGrindage. After about level 18 it does get a bit grindy. There are repeatable missions and areas where you can farm massive exp to ease the grind. There is still quite a bit of grinding, and  some mission rewards are often not worth the effort to complete once, much less repeat.\n\nPvp can turn into a camp fire furball.  Where people just rush out of the safe zone zerging over and over again. It doesnt happen much, and doesnt last long usually. The situation still is not fun and a waste of time.  Some people will try and and grief and camp you. Being a lowbie and fighting some one level 18 + can seem like an impossible task.\n\nConfusion. The game is pretty indepth and the mechanics are confusing. A person using a shot gun vrs a person in full pvp gear with a shield artifact and haor running will do no damage. This leads to people thinking the game is broken or some one is cheating.  Fiend ranged attacks can hit you through the smallest of openings.\n\nOver all I love the game. Sure it has problems, all games do. Its up to you to decide if you can take the good with the bad. For me its worth it. The zone is an exciting and fun place. There is always, and I mean always something more to do. There is so much more I could say. The zone is a large and dangerous place. It is not for every one as you can tell by the neg reviews.\n","February 9","true","944.3"," 41 of 68 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","41","68","4","3"

Anyways, here's my review.\n\n\nPros:\n- Decent graphics.\n- Friendly community (At newbie maps atleast).\n- Good concept, pretty similar to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R franchise (I know its not a stalker rip off but its pretty similar).\n- Developers are active at the community and actually listen to the community (Judging by getting a response from the developer on my previous review).\n- Couldnt find any game breaking glitches.\n- Decently big tutorial maps, couldnt imagine the size of the actual map that everyone plays on.\n\n\n\nCons:\n- Takes a long time to finish the tutorial maps.\n- SOMETIMES unclear on where to go or what to do.\n- Pretty simple GUI (Simple Dialog menu, etc.).\n- Textures glitch slightly and get messed up at distances (Trees far away, etc.).\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, people find think this game is bad because It takes a long time to finish the tutorial maps which they think is the actual map where everyone plays, but this game is actually good and is the total opposite of its reviews (Which are "mixed"). This game might get you addicted if you are into MMORPG games such as Maplestory. I personally think this game is good but might need some slight changes in the length of the tutorial maps (Make it shorter to complete of just make a tutorial to read when you create a new character or something like that).\n\n\n\n8/10","October 18, 2015","true","2.3"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","29","46","2","12"

Suddenly you find yourself squinting at the screen. What's that thing on the ground off to the left?  Is that what you think it is?\n\nYES. IT'S AN ARTIFACT. Change of plans. The value of that Artifact dwarfs the value of some mere mutant's pelt.\nYou holster your weapon and equip your Magnetic Grip Device.  You toss a rock in the general direction of the Artifact to check for deadly anomalies. You'd been fooled before and this time you know the drill. No unusual sounds or lights emerging from the ground where the rock was thrown. All clear.\n\nBy this time the mutant has wandered away to haunt some other sector of wasteland, uninterested in your rock-throwing antics. You're free to go collect your bounty in peace.\nYou sprint towards your newly found treasure, not because speed is necessary at the moment, but simply because you've understandably acquired a sort of paranoia that only surviving in a post-apocalyptic world can produce. You know running isn't the safest move right now, but you get the feeling that if you don't hurry and grab your Artifact, you'll somehow lose your chance.\n\nBIG mistake.\n\nYou find yourself in a strange orange cloud of dust. Your legs don't seem to work correctly anymore. You double over in pain, your lungs full of what feels like cement... living cement.\n\nIt is then that you remember: You never equipped your Air Filtration Mask. You knew that going to Vesuvius meant an inevitable run-in with air-born toxins, but the only PPE mask you had at the time was so dumb looking! No one would talk to a nooby looking player wearing that thing! Alas, your pride has finally allied with the reaper. The first effects of Sporosis have set in, and it's second deadly stage is closing in fast.\n\nWith the Artifact only a few feet away, you know that there's a good chance you can at least pick up your prize before surrendering completely to Sporosis, or anything that happens to take advantage of your weakened state. You know that upon dying, it will be up to The Fates to decide weather or not you will be allowed to keep your valued Artifact. The Fates can be cruel, but it's worth the gamble.\n\nStumbling and wheezing in agony, you soldier on towards your goal. Nothing else matters now; not the quest to find Vlad's son, not that new assault rifle you've been saving Ruples to buy, not the mysterious disappearance of those helicopters. This is all that matters: You must, nay, you WILL acquire your intended target.\n\nYou're close now. So close you can make out the beautiful patterns and strange designs forged on the Artifact's multifaceted surface. Forged by what, you do not know. By some force of nature, some unearthly power, some will of pure evil, or will of pure good? Does it matter?\n\nOut of the corner of your eye you see leaves and other forest debris pick themselves up as if of their own volition. They twirl and spin, faster and faster. Soon you find yourself no longer looking upon a graceful ballet of nature, but instead you find yourself gazing at a terrifying Vortex anomaly. It moves in unnatural patterns as if pacing, hunting it's prey. To your dismay it has decided to move in your direction.\n\nA few more steps and you will have the coveted Artifact in your hands.\nThe pain hits you again. Not now. Why now? Your chest heaving, your lungs struggling to take in the next breath, you double over again. Movement is now nearly impossible for you, and moving faster than a Vortex anomaly is out of the question. The swirling mass of radioactivity intercepts your movement towards the Artifact with ease, and you feel yourself being pulled towards it's center. You are thrust skyward and for a moment you get the feeling that it's safer up here than on the ground. Your false sense of security is short-lived, however.\n\nAfter being carried several yards away from your flight's genesis, you are hurled to the ground with what feels like an unfair amount of gravity assisting your trajectory. You hear as much as feel the crunch of bones being devastated by the force of your landing.\n\nYou are only allowed a few milliseconds of time lying on the ground before feeling an intense heat coming from underneath you. You've been thrown into a fire anomaly. The air around you seems to explode and you find yourself engulfed in hellish flame. Barely holding on to sanity, acting purely on animal instinct you roll to one side to escape the inferno.\n\nEverything is pure white. A rush of cold air brushes your skin. You feel like you're flying again. Not like the last time, but faster. You feel as if your body is hurtling through time and space. You know this feeling; you've felt it many times before: A teleportation anomaly.\n\nThe rush is gone. The warmth of Vesuvius's volcanic region is back. The pure white is gone. The blood red sky of this time and this space is back, and with it the pain. Though discombobulated and mangled by the events of the last few moments, you manage lift your head from the ground and get your bearings. That's when you see it.

I was hyped about this game for a long time because I'm a huge fan of STALKER and figured this game could scratch that itch.\n\nAnd it did.\n\nThe issues comes from the continued scratching of said itch, which this game cannot accomplish. The initial joy of entering a STALKER-like world is quickly removed as you realize how unpolished the game is. Normally this COULD be forgivable but in the case of sZone Online that actually creates a serious issue: The game is so unpolished it feels unstable and makes playing the game a difficult chore. I watched as at times I was tearing through mutants and players alike while at other times I would be killed by a mutant that was stuck in the ground or constantly stuck in an anomally even after respawning OR you get missions that aren't translated from Russian and THEN find out the mission is broken in the first place, so there was never a point. For times like these you NEED older veteran players to give you a hand because they MIGHT have the items you need before bad coding removed said items, etc.\n\nWhat killed it for me, however, was simply how dull it began to feel over time. The game doesn't really present any decent progression. When you get to the Camp (if you play you'll know where I'm talking about) there's really not major reason to keep going. At that point moving on feels more like a hinderence and a nuisance while staying only makes the whole experience stagnant. That word, right there, is what this game is: STAGNANT.\n\nAs a free game I would recommend it to scratch that STALKER itch, but really you're just going to have to wait for a better game to come along to give you some ointment for said itch.","May 27","false","7.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

Everything else is an mess, especially the gameplay. What I had hoped for was an open-world variant of the single player games that would allow me to explore the wasteland with a friend; with the proper survival elements and easy usability, both of which the game lacked.\n\nAt first I thought of playing this game with a friend out of curiosity, but it ended up with me telling him to hold off on the download. I realize this game is "based" on the franchise, but if you can't get the feel of the games, then what was the point? It's a lot of wasted potential and it kind of pains me to say that sZone is more of an insult to the games rather than an homage...\n\nBut hey! I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to reload my gun, I suppose this was just some kind of learning experience for me. Just remember everyone, if you think you've got it bad in other shooters, just know that at least you can reload your gun with ease.\n\nMADE FOR: People who've never actually played STALKER, and want an open world post-apocalyptic game\n\nNOT MADE FOR: Fans of the STALKER series\n\nSZONE 4/10","July 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

It used to be simple and fun but now everything is needlessly complex to the point where playing it almost feels like a chore that would have you grind and farm for 100 hours just to make one useless item and every change the devs make seem to be intentionally making the game as inconvenient as possible in order to get players to spend real money. It's not even just the best weapons and equipment now that cost gold, even basic systems and mechanics suffer too. A long time ago you could use medkits to revive fallen allies but now you can only do that with a special item for gold. To auto-trade in the marketplace also requires players to spend gold.\nWeapon balancing is horrible, it has gone through several changes and each one is somehow worse than the last and a recent change to the armor system looks like someone just pressed "randomise" on all the stats.\nFrom what I've seen all 3 steam servers have very low player bases which makes it feel like a single player game except with tons of lag, speaking of which seems to be worse than ever despite my lower ping on these servers.\nIt also feels like this is a game that will never leave the early access beta stage as the devs will milk the player base until there isn't enough left to pay the server costs.","December 8, 2015","false","31.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Online" but can't deliver.\n\nIt'll remind of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. because you are called a "stalker" in game, there are metro train tunnel loading screens, and it has a somewhat similar feel.  But the comparison ends there because this game is is no where near the same quality.\n\nHumorous, obviously bad anti-cheat system wouldn't let me start the game until I closed my Chrome browser (yep it thought "Chrome.exe" was a "cheat tool").\n\nObviously this game's budget is spread too thin.  It looks like something that was made ten years ago, and still low budget. Parts of it, including most of the voice-overs are still in Russian.\nI put the graphics on "very high" but still the polygon count is very low, low quality and often repeated textures, inside the buildings it's obvious (even in the screenshots above) much of the game is copy-paste replicated all over.\n\nFor most people duped into trying this game you'll probably uninstall it faster then you played it, but maybe some hardcore somewhat masochistic MORPG fans will stick with it for a while.

Consider that not enough time spent if you so wish, and have fun trying this junk.\n\nTo start out with: the language barrier. When I played this game, every player I met was Russian. All the NPC's voice acting is in Russian. Literally did not run into another English player in my 2 hours. (except the friend who I brought along in the first place to try the game with me)\nThen let's see next.. We've got the difficulty: alright, so in a survival game, difficulty is a good thing yea? In this case, no it isn't.. The stats and skills are not explained, you are left to test things and figure it out on your own. (Unless they have changed that aspect within the past 2 months) The reloading is very buggy and to obtain ammo you pretty much have to choose the uhh "class" that can craft it.. All the enemies hit very hard, which is the one thing I did find to be good.\nOn top of those things: the bugs.. So many dang bugs. Issues reloading (and yes I did read how to reload, it always takes me 3 or more tries just to reload still), enemies glitching, being able to fall through the ground here and there, is it a bug that I can't zoom in? I suppose that just wasn't a feature. Also general overall lagginess was a problem.\nI also think I spent my entire 2 hours within the tutorial zone.. Which is not good. The game pace is very slow.\nAll the quests I had encountered were typical MMO rinse and repeat "kill this, talk to this guy" or just simply "go here, talk to this guy".\nI never made it to the PvP zone or whatever, simply due to being bored the entire time, but, I've read that it has a lot of "cheaters/hackers".\n\nTL;DR - If you want a very difficult and grindy survival shooter MMO that requires a lot of thinking and a ton of patience and doesn't seem to have enough English players, you found it. Have fun.  If that's not your mug of beer, then good luck searching.\n\nI would certainly not recommend this game..","April 11","false","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

To a working person that's a really small amount lol.\n\nPros:\n+Stalker MMO\n+Great atmosphere\n+Pretty populated\n+ First and thirdperson mode\n+Pretty great for an mmo (skills,classes etc)\n+Easy to get into\n+99 cents!\n\nCons:\n-Pretty ugly\n-The fps is unstable (DayZ-wise)\n-The translationen is mediocre\n-Not fully translated so some russian\n\nAll in all i would give this a 6. You should absolutley get this if your a stalker fan. Hell even if you're not it's only 99 cents.","January 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 79 of 150 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","79","150","2","0"

It took about half an hour to get connected to my local server then disconnected due to being "inactive", I get in the game to a decent looking character creation screen.  The thing is, the background looks good, everything else is ♥♥♥♥.  The player models look like Gollum from Lord of the Ring.  I finally make my character, got in the game, everyone else looks exactly the same, only variation with clothes.  Also, apparently in Russia, there is no such things as females, so if you are hoping to make a Russian broad surviving the *apocalypse* then you are ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.  Apparently the "Wiz" head is popular.  I walk up to an NPC, they are talking Russian, as expected from a Russian game, but on a US server?  I thought it was weird at first, then I walked around more.  Then I started noticing the pattern.  Every single person is male, and is one of two people, one sounds half decent, the other guy sounds like he recorded it on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nPERFORMANCE\nI run with Titans and 8GB ram.  Max settings, the game gets even uglier and I have to deal with 10 FPS.\n\nAESTHETICS\nLike I said before, the characters look like ♥♥♥♥.  The variety of clothes at the start is so limited that you have to look like you are from the army or coming straight out of church.  The UI is clunky as all hell and doesn't even tell you anything you need to know.  The models used for the first person view are stolen straight from Counter Strike, not even any retexturing.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhat?  You were expecting a functional game out of this?  I was carrying around a round of Assault Rifle ammo, I tried to shoot the rifle at a dog who was chasing me.  "Weapon is Empty" I right click the ammo and add it to the weapon, try to shoot "Weapon is empty".  Pulled out my pistol and tried shooting "Weapon is empty" so I started pressing Q to throw rocks at the dog.  Rocks bounced off, hit me, and killed me.  A guy and his buddy walked over to my dead body.  He tried to take off his pants but that is impossible, and instead just t-bagged me instead.\n\nEXPECTATIONS\nI was expecting this game to be a sort of Fallout game set in Russia with a hint of Day-Z but with PVE and limited PVP.  What I got, was Fallen Earth + Day-Z + All of the bugs that followed both of them = sZone-Online\n\nOVERALL\nDon't download this piece of ♥♥♥♥.  I found all of the ♥♥♥♥ wrong with this game in 0.7 hrs and found all of this ♥♥♥♥.  If you want to waste the hard drive space to find out I was right.","May 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","54","34","63","15","0"

After you gear up a bit, you start your travels on the larger maps in "the zone". Theres anomalies, theres monsters, but worst of all its very large distances, lack of safe places, safe vaults to store your stuff and other players that might want to kill you and steal your stuff. On other hand there are also the comeraderie amongst the stalkers that somewhat makes up for the hardships.\n\nSimilar games are Dayz, Nether those kind of games, but they dont have the quirky russian feeling like this game does. Its definately not a game for everyone, but it is a special kind of game, and as such draws some special people.\n\nIts a grind game, I personally like the exploration and the helping of new arrived friendly Stalkers.\n\nIts the game I love to hate. So much potential, so much hope for this game when it first came out. I believe at this moment its 5 years later and lots of different companies and developers have tried their hands on it. At the moment its the steamversion so its somewhat good.","April 3","true","368.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You guys added first person, games run smooth now at Ultra with 71 FPS. So you fixed performance. AWESOME! I just wish more people played this.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is my review before they updated and added first person and fixed performance ---\n\nThis game I like so far. I love the idea of it so much! It's like a RuneScape/World of Warcraft type of game but its based on modern times and has real weapons. Not all fantasy like.\n\nReally, the only things I don't enjoy about this game is that stupid guy CONSTANTLY talking over the radio that speaks Russian so it's worse because I can't understand him. But seriously, make it so he does not talk NON-STOP. It's soo annoying. And the second thing I don't like, is the performance. It just sucks. My computer is good enough to run it ultra 60fps, but nope, this game I have to run at medium with 27-31 fps average. Third thing I hate about this game is that it is not first person. Not a big one, I can deal with it, but a game with guns, should be an option to go first person. Kinda got sad when I figured out I could not go first person. Other than that, everything is fine.\n\nI really do see myself playing this game for HOURS and HOURS. But I am just going to wait for a few better updates to come out. I really hope you add first person, and add english audio. May take some time but I can wait! And make the guy stop talking CONSTANTLY.\n\nI forgot something, you should also add mission markers on the mini map when you are doing a mission. When I do a mission/quest, I don't know where to go because there is no marker on the mini map. Other than those problems, if they fix them, this game could be an awesome game.","March 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

This is not a fast race to level up and be awesome and unkillable like most shooter games, seems like its designed is for prolonged game play with realistic learning you would see in real life as a survivor going thru this. You wont expect to be great as a normal person being thrown into an apocolyptic society and be a natural born killer over night, its gonna take time.\nOverall, I can see this game being great and a huge success when its full translation is completed, as it is now its alot of fun, does need some english speaking moderaters who will be online to help "us" get the hang of the game and answer questions until its updated fully!!","January 13, 2015","true","264.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It is also free from their website but (could before hand) be bought on Steam for a special 100 ingame money.\n\nGetting right in:\n\nThe title looks god awful no matter the settings, the FPS goes up and down like a hookers knickers this title needs to greatly improve these performance issues.\n\nA plus and a good thing is, it can be played in 1st person (F4) to help with immersion, NPC quests however don't help to much immersion wise as tthey are guessing games not that they are all in Russian they just hold no real interest to whoever is reading them after the 5th time you've been looking for the right NPC.\n\nIts like reading the same lines of text numerous times guessing/looking for the right NPC at the right time to trigger the right event, this chore increases the unhelpful likelihood off skip ahead important text. NPCs names are from what I've seen all in Russain which means you will more likely be checking every NPC to try and find out who the hell is who, hence the burnout above. A fix of giving them English names will help greatly somewhat with the above. Like invisible walls its plagued with completing linear collecting  tasks/quests that bores you to tears. I do hope that after the 1st town this game opens up. It could do with dumping the old tried stadard MMO stuff and replace it with more open-world survival.\n\nThe controls themseves i can't really fault and seem stantard stuff for a MMO. The community I have had little interaction with its hard to know if its toxic or not due to langauge. Althou the community do love to spam areana invites every two mins that got me killed twice. Specailly when you are on your way to collecting (x) number of mutant pubez as part of the quest/task you've been given. I'm sure all MMO's are just  the same game reskinned it like they don't have a orignal thought between them.\n\nI'm keeping this title a thumbs down for now. Its just not the langauge barrers, the NPC interactions with yourself, the proforrmance issues. Its a title that has missed the boat a longtime ago, its been under delopment for years, looks older than even that. At this moment I can't see this becoming anything special, its a old game that has been given CPR due to current interest in surivial games. I would recommend any of the REAL S.T.A.L.K.E.R games over a average f2p MMO that simply plays homage too it.","January 2, 2015","false","4.9"," 34 of 65 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","34","65","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg/recommended/316390/","Sivarg","Siv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg/","391 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI only lasted around 40 mins or so playing this free ♥♥♥♥♥♥me.\nIt's clearly inspired from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.\n\nWhen starting the game you will be prompted to choose a name for yourself, then choose two factions, Locals and Aliens. The locals are those that survived since the start of the zone's outbreak, while the aliens is a given name to those that come from outside the zone. It's stated each faction has several classes, though you don't actually get to pick them at the start. I presume that's later on.\n\nThe character creation isn't too bad, it has 25 head options, the rest are starting clothing, boots and pants, which are either 8 options to 5 options with boots and pants.\n\nOverall the graphics aren't amazing, it feels like a game from 2006 or even before.\nAs said, the surroundings and theme feel alot like a stalker game. You'll have to be highly interested in stalker games aswell as being okay with playing a low graphiced game to enjoy this. It's not horrendious mind you. But it's no way near perfect.\n\nApparently the game started as russian only, but english has been added to the quests and dialog with npc's. There are just quite a few english typo's, aswell as a few laughable sentences that is no doubt poorly translated by someone who was a russian. For any grammar nazi, it is cringe-worthy, but hey, even Overkill made a few typo's in their payday 2 game.\n\nThe guns look slightly better than the character textures and you can switch between first and third person.\nThe enemies are quite various, but also rather low textured. Interestingly though, there are anomalies in the game, another element famous from the stalker series.\n\nOnce you leave the starting zone, you have a choice to go into a safe zone (a large town) but warned that if you leave it, you will be out in open pvp atmosphere. You also have a second choice, to go to the same town, but it is just pvp instantly, so there won't be a safe zone.\n\nThe game also has a store to buy ingame currency for real money, but the buyable stuff that requires this currency don't look impressive, more like retextured items that other vendors already sell ingame.\n\nI only managed to play around 40 mins again, so I haven't covered all of the game, no doubt by far. But I wasn't impressed when I arrived to the town, and quickly decided to save my time on other games. Again, this free game is worth a try if you enjoy stalker/wasteland games, if not, you'll only be in it for a few minutes before deciding to uninstall like so many others.","March 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 37 of 71 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","37","71","4","10"

My friends and i had more intense and funny expierences on this game then any other. The community was very tight and everyone knew everyone. The game is hard to get the hang of but when you learn to survive it becomes beyond fun. There are 3 zones we reached the 2nd was still hard to survive even after playing for around 90-100 hours, we aquired friends and enemies through-out our playthrough of the game as well.\n\nThe difficulty becames greater and greater where the best loot is, For example PPSH-41 is one of the most expensive in game items. We heard rumors of the ppsh farm and didnt believe them until we met the most hated man in the game "Legion" The leader of the strongest PK clan in the game at the time, he agreed to lead us through a mine field, monster spawn, insta-kill floor traps. it took us 30 minutes of following him while he protected us to get to the ppsh spawn and even then there was a low chance they were even there. After Legion showed us the way we began to charge money to be a guide for other players to get to the ppsh farm.\n\n\nHorribly worded and awful grammar but this is just one example where we used an outside game idea into a business. Register that for a second We made a business in a survival game. People knew us from giving them guides where ever we went. We would get PM etc to help them all over the map.

The text guidence is poor and the graphics dated, I however stuck with it.\n\nI then shot some rats, or at least thats what the game said they were. Ran out of pistol ammo and moved to the next area, the train station.\n\nInside the train station you get an AK47 and I moved on to a few side missions where I quickly ran out of bullets and that spelt the end of this game for me because to replenish these you have to pay.... something I was not willing to do for this hunk of crap!\n\nAvoid wasting your time with it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfOI3Ym2H4Y","March 25","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

Go to them if you are english, ask for SavageHippie, but don't come untill you are as ready as you can be at least level 10.\n\nOther than that, the developers of this "true stalker game" are still rolling up updates, bug fixes etc:\nThe community is extremely active, you will find tons of players(Like I'm pretty damn sure each server probably has around 100-200 players online at any given time, I could be wrong)They have a moscow and saint petersburg(the newest server and least densley populated, the better for newbies imo)there is relatively no hacking whatsoever, I have not encountered a single hacker.\n\nI play this game from South Africa at around 290ms to 350 and I get almost no desync/lag, it's as if I am playing a single player game, even in multiplayer PVP moments.\n\nThere are microtransactions, and a currency system, Gold rubles and normal rubles which can buy stuff at any store mainly relate to equipment(most of which is cosmetic)and weapons, however the items that are in the game are not extremely overpowered, but do not expect going against a veteran player(of which there are tons now, as well as some newbies)expecting to win everytime, however a couple well placed rounds albeit a bit hindered by the armor stats(RPG mechanics btw)will be enough to take any player down.\n\nThere are quite a few clans as well.\n\nHmm...what else to say, oh waaaaaay better graphics and better performance compared to when I last played this piece of crap Szone, there is no true first person mode, but there is an optics mode, which is...suffiecent I suppose, albeit dissapointing, it is probably my only gameplay gripe apart from the learning curve and difficulty getting into.\n\nIf you are patient, and determined this will be a very worthwhile experience, even if the game is in beta, and there is still much to be done.\n\nMy money if I ever spent any(real life) would go to Stalker online, not this garbage rip-off.","January 13","false","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to talk to a quest giver.

If you die, you lose items in your inventory depending what you are carrying, any items equipt will not be dropped, this allows players to have a purpose when killing others, it is not your average tab target MMO where you die, run out, die again, repeat, no.. This mmorpg is about fighting or befriending who you want for whatever reason you want, the purpose can be to take their loot or mabye you have some unresolved conflict with them earlier? Mabye you want to be their friend but you decide you dont like them and want to part ways with their belongings?\n\nWhat you do is only limited by your creativity, this game has a completely player driven economy, clans take bases which allows them to acquire rare devices such as land mines and then that clan has the power to decide who can and cant have these devices, this is what starts alliances and wars, clans will either decide they want to help the clan in control of the rare resources/devices so that they can get some too eventually or they will decide to wage war to take what they want.\n\nThe PVP combat can be compared to counterstrike, rust and dayz, there is bleeding, illness and medicine to heal like dayz but turn the wrong corner and you will die in a heartbeat from a fully automatic AK which will fire similar to counterstrike, the reason i say counterstrike is because the recoil and spray resembles counterstrike more than it does dayz or rust. The Political/RP aspect to PVP could be compared to Darkfall: Unholy Wars or Arche Age, you fight for bases / fortifications, you control the resources, the goal is to control the game.\n\nNow when you start the game you will probably be put off by the mid 2000 style graphics or the unexplaining UI/controls   but if you can see past the early game difficulties, this will become a game almost any mmo/survival game enthusiast will enjoy and about those mid 2000 style graphics i mentioned, this game is going to go to the Unreal 4 Engine eventually, it has already been announced, the game is released but still has alot of plans for the future.\n\nI could go on for ages about this game, i have not even scratched the surface about everything i would love to say about this game, all i will say is just try the game, see for yourself, give it a few hours, you wont regret it.\n\nSee you in the Zone,\nReno\n\nCharacter name: RenoTheOne","December 30, 2015","true","579.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","8","15","3","5"

Huge potential, but development is sloppy and slow. Badly optimized, but even on high settings graphics are somewhat a joke. Mind you, I don't care much for graphics, but this is to inform people, after all. The content that's there feels unpolished, and a constant feel of amateurism washes over you while playing.\n\nHowever, if you run around the game with this feeling, like I did, you will also often be surprised by the many different angles the game offers. There is plenty to do, you can put hundreds of hours into the game and still see new things the next hour. Eventually the feeling of amateurism would remain, but added with a feeling of that these devs know what they want, and what they want is "proper", so to speak, but also that the road there will be long and hard.\n\n--------\n\nOverall it's only barely a MMORPG in the traditional sense, and that's something i'm happy about. It may not feel very open world due to the game being composed of several (large!) different maps, but in effect you're absolutely free to go where you want. Knowledge of the game, maps, anomalies and etc is more important than hours put into the game, in many situations.\nSkill and/or luck also plays a big role; Where in a traditional MMORPG a lvl 10 does not stand a chance against a lvl 20, this does not apply here. Especially in PvE it's more dependant on how you handle the situation. However, as you progress, you are able to get better gear and this too, plays a big role.\n\n\nWhile in essence most quests are well made and interesting, considering they are mostly relatively simple/traditional kill and fetch quests, they are unable to immerse you properly, one of the biggest things keeping you from being very immersed is sloppy and missing translations.\n\nOverall the combat IS good, but just doesn't feel very good due to eternal lag/latency issues.\n\nIt sometimes feels like the russian player dominancy ruins the community aspect for non russian players, and hackers can ruin any session at any time.\n\n\nStill.. I do recommend the game. It's a special game. It's one of a kind... We should be happy it exists in it's current form.\n\nWe all know a true franchise S.T.A.L.K.E.R. MMORPG would be a traditional grindfest that would probably not feel anything like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. except the world it takes place in. This MMORPG, sZone, tries hard to avoid the traditional MMORPG feel while still attempting to maintain some degree of balance and still stay true to some of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. concepts. It's far from reaching it's goal, however.\n\n\nCan't comment much on microtransaction/P2W, as last I played is over a year back (Except these few hours on steam) and haven't researched what is available and if any items aren't available for F2P. Far as I can remember, back then, it was Pay to Progress faster, mostly gear wise. Not P2W. But can't be sure.\nEdit: I read a different review stating the best armors are only available for premium currency. If true, that would without a doubt mark the game as P2W. While being extremely against P2W, I chose not to let this influence my recommendation.","January 3, 2015","true","2.8"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

Got to level 5 so far and this game has been put together horribly. A lot of simple mechanics missing make this game very hard to play. e.g. The quests do not even tell you where to go, just who to talk to and even then it's impossible to even complete them. Do not play this game solo or you will have an extremely hard time playing but even with a team I find this very frustrating to play just due to a ton of easy mmo mechanics that are not in the game.","September 10, 2015","false","5.3"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","16","31","2","11"

The pumping of the character, different quests and rewards for their performance. Large selection of weapons and armor as well as their craft and sharing. Different mobs, anomalies and artifacts.

I can't say how good the for-pay addons make it, because I'm not spending the money on them! I normally do this if I feel a game is really really good to begin with. That being said, sZone-Online definitely isn't bad.\n\nPlay Style\n\nDid you ever play Anarchy Online? The engine and play style is a LOT like Anarchy Online. I felt pretty at home with it, but the whole thing feels like it just moves way too slow. I do like the way the weapons work, and the crafting system, but it seems like there's way too much to do in a game that should have faster pacing. I'm going to check back with it later, but right now it's a little too young to make a good judgment about the quality of it.\n\nSound\n\nMute it, listen to your own music. Sound is the only thing that I can say really detracts from it. If they were to increase the actual game speed by about 50% and get some better sounds (particularly for the voice actors, the levels are all over the place for EVERYTHING.) It would definitely bump up the quality.\n\nOverall.\n\nI'll play it again in a few months. For a free to play title, it's really not that bad. It works pretty well, navigation is a bit difficult, but that's true of any new MMORPG. I have to hand it to them for not doing a copy of Blizzard's MMO engine. It's nothing like that, and I really liked the Anarchy Online system so it's a nice thing to play around with again. SUPER similar to that.\n\nRight now I'm giving it a 6.5/10 - Check it out, but it's still too young to really put a ton of time into.","April 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","0"

After geting done with the amazing tutorial I head out in to the wastland where I had a rock throwing fight while I was walking like a crab with a group of people. Afterwards I started doing more exploring until I saw the hill off into the distance. So I started heading towards the hill and a army of giant mutated spiders staring running down the hill towards me. I pull out my gun and started shooting at them but then the ground open up and The Dark Lord Cthulhu awoken from his slumber. I try to pop off a few rounds on him but to no effect. He raise his hand and swung it down and hit me with the force of a thousand suns. The next thing I know I woke up on my floor with an adrenaline needle sticking out of my chest.

First ofa ll none of the "aiming" uses the iron sights (which are clearly on the guns) Instead if gives you a more adjusted cross hair. In an mmo where there is pretty much no other way of attack besides shooting, you need something more than a plain crosshair when you're trying to "aim". I shouldn't have to buy a scop to be able to stick the gun up to my face and use the ironsights. Also throwing rocks is rather useless. Trying to get the attention of 1 creep without pulling an entire group of poorly moving constantly jumping spiders and rats... just...

The third time my antivirus deleted a DLL  and suddenly the game started.\nLets begin with the positive things: This game has potential as a free to play game, nice layout, everything works fine without lagging and the UI is easy to understand... Ones you get your first weapon you are ready to kill some monsters or jump in a pvp match. Its an apocaliptic world so you need to find your way.\nThings I didnt like much was the russian language, and where there can be found a translation, its really bad, with all respect for our Russian comrades, I dont understand a word of Russian, it would certainly improve the game if there would be a full english version or a better translation. The radio station in the background is broadcasting in Russian as well. The controls can be a little clunky, but nothing to spoil the fun.

Nothing close to the real S.T.A.L.K.E.R.!\nEverything from the controls to the menus, interaction with NPC's, your first steps in the game, monsters, it was a total dissapointment and it's cheaply done in my eyes, it could've been so much more and so much better with a little more effort and dedication.\nStill i didn't want to give up easy as i wanted to like it and get that awesome S.T.A.L.K.E.R. feeling, but no, i only felt more dissapointment as i progressed into the game and i gave up. UNINSTALL!\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThere are way better games out there, this one is outdated, irrelevant and since it tries to stand in the shadows of the real S.T.A.L.K.E.R., it should be burned to the ground for trying to mimic one of the best game series i ever played.\nThe 'makers' of 'sZone' should be ashamed for creating this rip-off of a game, have you not got any braincells that can think up an original idea for a game instead of doing this fail rip-off job you call 'sZone'?\nI do NOT recommend this game to others, and if i had 3 wishes from the magic game geenie, one of them would be that this game didn't exist and never would be able to exist.\n\n\nGameplay   : 3/10\nControls      : 2/10\nGraphics     : 4/10\nSound         : 2/10\nVFM*           : 0/10*VFM = Value for money","May 8, 2015","false","2.9"," 30 of 61 people (49%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","49","30","61","12","5"

It seems like it has potential... but it just isn't a good game.\nThe graphics are terrible, which I'm fine with. I can get over graphics very easily. However, even with the lowest setting, the most fps I could get out of the game was 18, making it pretty unplayable.\n\nI got to lvl 2 by shooting mutant dogs, and then my gun jammed, jammed again, jammed again, and then I died. The game also lacks any kind of instructions on what you're supposed to do. Me and many other players spent 10+ minutes just figuring out how to get a gun, and then it took a while to even get the gun working.\n\nYou have to talk by a guy at your spawn, who says he'll give you a gun at lv 3 (which is impossible to get to without a gun) and that you need to bring him a stick. So you walk to the middle of the building, talk to another guy, gives you a gun to finish the last quest. After you get that, don't equip the ak or the pistol. Sell the pistol and the buckshot ammo, and then you have to drag the magazine onto the gun, then equip the gun, then right click the ammo for the ak, then you have to load the ammo. And now you can reload.\n\nIt seems like an outdated fps, that requires an expensive computer just to run.\nFor now, i'll stick to things like firefall for fps mmo's.","May 15, 2015","false","0.8"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","12","25","3","1"

It seemed promising at first, but it's really not. It's just a complete fail. Majority of the people who play this game speak another language, I believe it was probably Russian? Even though my friend and I were both on the NA Server, not the European one. Quests are completely broken in this game. It has a tag of "Open World," although to get around, you have to walk alongside walls for a couple minutes, to get to the other side, which was disappointing. The mobs in this game are terrible. Suddenly my friend and I were attacked by three giant spiders, and immediately died. We had the choice to either wait and respawn in that exact place and die again, or go back to spawn, which wasn't that far from there, you would only have to walk along the wall to get around. Also, played this game on max settings, graphics were still terrible, I'm pretty sure DayZ has better graphics on the lowest settings possible than this. If you want a real "Open World," apocalyptic type of game, I recommend DayZ or H1Z1, whichever suits your taste.","August 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There is no help at all for this game, you blindly wonder around trying to find the quest objective and in most cases there is no lead as to where the hell you are supposed to go other than "west" for example. do yourself a favour and dont waste 100 hrs of your time.

To start, the game lagged even when I put the graphics at the bare minimum and it looked like it could have bean on the origional Xbox. I know graphics are not everything, and if the game was amazing and it ran decently I would have let it slide. Next, the game didn't give you a very clear tutorial, forcing you to guess what did what and a quest system that gave you little to no detail about what to do. Finaly, it was origionaly made in I beleive Russian. That wouldn't be a problem if they didn't have as many grammatical errors and some dialouge that is in Russian. Even after all of that, I would still try it since its free. Just don't get your hopes up.","January 27","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

To start, the game lagged even when I put the graphics at the bare minimum and it looked like it could have bean on the origional Xbox. I know graphics are not everything, and if the game was amazing and it ran decently I would have let it slide. Next, the game didn't give you a very clear tutorial, forcing you to guess what did what and a quest system that gave you little to no detail about what to do. Finaly, it was origionaly made in I beleive Russian. That wouldn't be a problem if they didn't have as many grammatical errors and some dialouge that is in Russian.

I am not sure). It seems to be the same game only that game seems to have received actual development and progress! It's looks, feels, sounds and play much better than sZone.

The whole combat style in itself is a bit awkward, because the mutants move really weird. When you try to pick up items it lags a bit, and the character movement could use some improvement. Quests don't give you that much information so you're left running around a vacant land with funky mutants trying to kill you, not knowing what the objective is. If the game developers decided to carry on with this game I can see some potential with some updates and overall improvement of mechanics. It's one of those games where you try really hard to get into, but the little issues just make it difficult. So in the games current state, I do not reccomend it.","April 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This has got to be one of the worst survival games I've ever played. My reasons: Bugs, everywhere! Instructions to load the Ak are not provided, therefore I sat for 10-15 minutes dragging, dropping, clicking, etc. to no prevail. I ran out of ammo shooting the rats I guess I was supposed to kill, and I tryed to kill them with rocks, but the aim is terrible on them, and they appear to do nothing at the moment. The game's sound and textures are very low quality, it reminded me of playing an old Doom. I do see where the developer is trying to go with this game: MMO-RPG style "zombie" survival shooter/pvp game. At this point, I would not reccommend it to a friend, but I am going to continue following this game, because I really want to see where he/she goes with it.","April 8","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Starts off as a recommended game and moves towards the opposite.\n\nI would say this game is a diamond in the rough but its not exactly a diamond. Its really rough around the edges and its clunky. But its enjoyable and captures some of the STALKER/Metro vibe that I personally have been looking for. I played this game back before it was added to steam I have made a total of 4 characters in my time and each time I ended up abandoning them because I had no idea what to do until recently when I found a clan. FIND A CLAN it will make your life easier and you will enjoy the game with the help.\n\nLets start with the veggies first:\nOkay english translations - its more or less accurate to what you actually have to do but the dialog is laughable sometimes.\nLarge RU population - I play on the NA server and I would say about half of the population doesnt speak english.\nClunky combat and movement - you can move past it once you get used to it but it can be annoying at first.\nPoorly optomized - Im running a hex core i7 and a 660 ti and on medium settings I get 70 fps with drops to 30 fps and when memory leaks happen which they happen a lot I get forced to sit around 20-30 frams. But a simple relaunch fixes it.\nNot Graphically impressive - not much to say here.\nNot Newbie Friendly - The game can be hard to understand and doesnt do a good job of pointing you in the right direction. Dont epext it to theme park you like WoW. A lot of players, myself included, didnt have an idea what to do when they hit the first big zone.\n\nOn to the desert:\nInteresting PvP system - There is a flagging system in the game so its managable to not have to worry about other players. But there are areas that flag you/force you into pvp which you need to watch out for. There is a wealth system that means if you collect enough value on your person whether its in ammo, mutant parts, artifacts, or junk you eventually are forced to flag. Thankfully when you die you can get back up or spawn back to a safe zone. Going to the same zone has a change to drop some of your loot. But never your guns/armor.\nVibe - It has that STALKER/Metro vibe where the world is dangerous and even in high end armor the world is a dangerous place. No dying is not linked to your gear or level but the gear can come in handy. It mostly comes from experience. Much like it is supposed to in the STALKER series.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would I suggest this game to anyone? Because its a small download and its free. And due to the atmostphere I would suggest any Metro or STALKER player out there at least give it a try.\n\nTL;DR: Its clunky, tough, russian, and sometimes downright frustrating. But its fun, free, small to download, and it scratches that STALKER itch. If you give a try hit up the steam forums to see if you can find a clan to join. It helps a lot.\n\n\nEDIT 7/22/2015 : also, you are basically screwed if you ever need support. So far half the responses for my support tickets in the english support area have been in russian. One ticket has been in for almost a week now and the other for a day or two. They give a response very quickly but actually solving the problem they seem to be inadept at. So god help you if you need support\n\nEDIT 7/29/2015 : Recently they added the ability to buy weapons for real cash in the cash shop in this game. But not just any weapons, weapons that are pretty hard to get ahold of and not just for any price. They are selling them right now for $80 god damn dollars. USD of course. Now that the game has offically stepped into a blatant pay to win moment with high tier PVP armor and the best guns in the game being buyable without any work. I cant recomment this game. Only bother playing this game if you are really craving a STALKER MMO and you can suffer through it massive faults. As of writing this edit I am done with this game. Its a P2W game that runs like ♥♥♥, the NA server is unstable, and over half the NA player base is russian while most players dont even speak english.","July 7, 2015","false","271.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I find myself having to couch constantly to aim for the hitboxes. In addition to them being small, they seem to amubush you easier. I died constantly, and lost a lot of my ammo. You can't survive without a gun, even though they offer you the option to 'throw a stone,' which I thought would be quick and an 'oh ♥♥♥♥ my gun it jammed and I need to kill this before I die and have to wait an annoying 30 seconds.' Well I don't know if you know, but hitting a small mob with a rock, and you have to aim for this incredibly fast mob .. it isn't fun.\nBut let's stop talking about how annoying it is to hit mobs. You know what's even more annoying? Earning enough money to buy one clip of ammo. And you run out so fast, even by conserving ammo by firing one shot at a time. Especially for the amount of quests you get that requires you to kill MORE stuff.\nIn summary, combat sucks, quests are dull, nothing exciting happens in this game except for getting a roll of toliet paper from a quest and haven't no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what it's used for.","January 13","false","17.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The first thing you will notice is most everything is in Russian which can be very confusing at first but for me it meant having to talk to an NPC then having to re-talk to them to get the English text. It was not hard to figure out. I made a friend basically right when I started the game up. We figured out how to group up and started questing together. The games provides many laughs in a mostly dreary and depressing world.\nBefore I knew it I was killing bald rats and decapitating mutant puppy dog heads. The quests for the most part seem a bit "Fetchy" at times but is still very early in gameplay. I am interested to see what type of end-game content sZone has.(I am only level 5 as of writing) The arena is hard as nails but still has some intrigue. I mostly joined to get insta-killed by some Russian dude.\nThe world is mostly open with some invisible walls here and there. The graphics aren't anything to write home about but the fun in the gameplay defintely is there. Nothing bad considering it's in early access. If you are Russian, a fan of MMO's, or post-apocalyptic themed games I'd say snatch this game up.\n\nKilled numerous Rats and Mutated Puppy Dogs with an AK-47  - 10/10\n\n-Casey","December 30, 2014","true","1.6"," 34 of 70 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","34","70","0","2"

I have compressed an hour’s gameplay into this five minute highlight first-impressions video if you want to see what it is like. Or you can read the review below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8r0pa-iy-c&feature=youtu.be\n\nThis game is to Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, what Elder Scrolls Online was to Skyrim; an interesting idea with some graphical scale-back.  The general feel of gameplay is affected by the fact that a Single Player FPS (the original Stalker) has been turned into a Multiplayer TPS. That being said, the environments are atmospheric, look good and are open to exploration. Not so sure about the animations however, which currently look clunky and are incomplete. The sound also requires work but can sometimes make you jump.\n\nThere does not seem to be any PVP survival element yet although there is a H2O counter among other survival based indicators on the dash. It is difficult to say anything conclusive regarding the game's mechanics however as all of the text-based instruction is in Russian.\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs up, not based on its current state but on what it might one day become. It is actually quite playable but at the same time is clunky and incomplete. However, compare this game to Day Z, which has been in Early Access for years and is still trying to get its base-zombies to work properly while its staff censor negative comments on its forums, this game is a gem. It is functional, offers varying encounters, and the devs seem really friendly and eager to receive feedback.

YES! First of all - read the whole review and click on the REPORT button on this steam page. WE HAVE TO remove this game from Steam. Somehow.\n\nSo. First thing. All games should encourage player in first 20-30 minutes of gameplay. Why? Because if player isn't encouraged he will find another game and uninstall previous. This is simple, the main rule of gaming industry. You can't encourage player, you lose. Devs, please, deal with it or simply close your game...\n\nWorst sound system in gaming industry history. My ears started to bleed because all voices in the game have the same volume, no matter from what distance. Flare is heard equally in the same volume no matter how far away and inside/outside. So when you are attacked by something it may be 30 meters away or 1 meter away.\n\nAnimations are based in timeline, somewhere... around 2005. They have bugs, characters jump and squat in a split of second, the opponents rotate around themself. The world does not make sense, there is no imagination, has not been considered. sZone-Online is based on CS-style when we are talking about shooting. There's no zoom for weapons.\n\nQuests are based on "kill X mobs" and there's simply no quest log. You have to guess where you should go, ask other people or simply explore. The first quest in the game is most funny - you have to kill some rats without ammo. You do not get ammo durning the tutorial or first quest. But to make it even funnier. That's not all. Tou can kill the rats on sight. You can just approach them, and they will kill themselves. Just like that. Probably out of fear. I don't know. I was trying to kill these rats somehow, but they was always popping and dying when I was close to them... LOL!?\n\nLanguage of the game. This game isn't for English speaking players. 30% of the game is based on Russian language, even when the game is few years old. They where trying to translate this game using Google Translate - "Weapon is too early to repair". Is this correct? Maybe. But sound stupid. So, as I said - if devs can't translate tutorial of this game since months, you have clear vision how they deal with non-Russian players.\n\nSo, my conclusion is simple - I'm using REPORT button right now and I'm totaly agaist developers of this game. This is totaly unstable, bugged, poor made and Russian-based game. I simply don't care about how big developers team is. They are making bad work and bad game. I've hope that sZone-Online will be removed, because this one big russian-font bug is blaming the idea of Steam...","January 12, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"

Also I get killed by invisible dogs, rats, and spiders occasionally. I get it this game is beta but it\nDRIVES ME INSANE! Long walks from one place to another and half the chat isin't translated so i have to guess "top button or bottom button" and that couldv'e been anything like a free item or a quest. Arena was crap for me, I was playing 1 v 2 and i was 1, not fair but I still didn't die once but I also have a request that Arena lets ou not use up your ammo so you can keep it for survival, I buy a new pack to just use it all up in an arena match. Why does everything cost so much, look at my hours of playing, I haven't received an helmet, armor, or even a backpack! Also when pressing n should PERMANATELY keep the models from appearing, I hate walking down the street to see a guy randomly pop into the world multiple times and I have to press N again and again. Speaking of N why can't there be an easier was of talking to NPC's! I hate that when I look at one if theirs even one player in front of him it's impossible to talk to him, and no one decided to tell me for 10 minutes what to do at the starter area. Graphics are fine as long as i'm concerned, the gameplay is too dull, the running runs out too fast and you don't run fast enough, reloading is a b*tch and gun jamming is a nice way to keep people fro holding down the trigger but I think guns are messed up. Why do guns have stats? This game says if you pick up a gun from a gunstore, and someone else finds one in the wild, JUST the same as yours but since it's from the wild it has some extra damage. zombies in the beginning are tiny gemlins called "brownies" which I have no idea who thought of such a name, they are GREY people! The munchkins run too fast for my sight to even LOOK at them. Why isin't their an "aim down the sight" button, theirs right click ut it shortens the spray and prey reticle, so I can't shoot a wold without hoping the bullet didn't go flying around his face.\n\nI don't hate this game completely but the story is their and the lighting, but if theirs room for improvement put music, it's so anticlimatic to walk down the street hearing absolutely nothing, but the constant replaying loop of "BARK" BARK" "BARK" "GROWL" it ruins the feeling that this is an apocolypse. This game will be the first to actually call the beginning players stalkers, and newbies and every npc thats better then them like military and police will say that they get eaten and some send you off on a quest to DIE HORRIBLY, I wish this game made me laugh somehow, it's too serious and you'll meet some interesting characters but until then watch how you grind on the same "Harmless rat" for hours on end till you hate your life and spend money on the armor which makes people look like a badass and realize that the armor isin't as good as you thought and still get rekt by every monster that is just 1 level above you and realize that monsters can spawn in packs and if you are anywhere near prepare thy endurance meter even though you can't outrun Spiders.\n\nHAVE FUN...\n\np.s. there are no fem models, only men for some stupid reason.","January 10, 2015","false","5.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","1"

The quests suck. Its too easy to acquire weapons. The graphics are horrible. I'm sure the actual gameplay isn't bad but I didn't play the game long enough to get to the PVP-kill-everyone part.\n\nAbout the quests. You could get them from practically everyone. For Ex.

This is also an Early Access review.\n\nGraphics: The graphcis look very dated, with an almost ps2 quality.  The world and character models look decent, but close inspection shows issues.  The character models also feel stiff and have odd animations.  There is (at least for me) some pop-in with distant models.  The game LOOKS decent, but that's it.\n\nSound: Sound is what makes good atmosphere, gives tension and excitment.  This game does not have that.  Sure, you hear random Russian dialouge around from PCs, gunshots and monster grunts.  But there is really nothing there to affect you audiowise.  The orginal S.T.A.L.K.E.R. had sounds that made you scared and frightened at what was stocking you; or scared you indoors when a Psi Storm came up.  Not once did I feel scared of threatened being outside.  The sound is pretty lame.\n\nControl:  The keyboard/mouse controls are mostly competant, but very sluggish at times.\n\nGameplay:  The main issue of this game.  Being that the game is still about 40%-60% Russian, so it can be hard to find certain characters for quests since they're names are still in Russian, while the quest log gives your the English names.  The quests are "mostly" in english, though I have come across some still untranslated.  Same goes for some items.  Leveing up is also tedious, as it takes a while to reach the next level, and there is really no explanation on how to select skills.  It took me an hopur to figure out how that system worked.  Money is also difficult to come by, which is frustrating because you ALWAYS need ammo and ammo isn't cheap; and as far as I have seen, there is NO melee weapons.  But the biggest issue is the lag.  Everytime I have played, my ping was usuallly no less than 240!  This is bad for a shooter, as you could take damage from something you don't even see yet, or keep taking damage from something you killed seconds earlier!  You will also waste ammo shooting at things that have long since moved.  The lag sometimes even makes the gameplay unbearable.\n\nAs it stands now, I CANNOT reccomend this game.  Not without it's issues being fixed and the lag improved as best it can.  Hopefully in the future, the game will be fat better when it comes out of Early Access.","March 5, 2015","false","5.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Waited for the game to load while listening to the beautiful instrumental. Game asks me to choose a server. Immediately the game goes silent as I await to join the U.S. server. Took way too long to join so i ended up leaving dissapointed. To my own delight i was once again greeted by the melody of the gods and sat back in my seat until the song ended. Unfortunately it didn't loop so i ended up going back into the que and instantly leaving just to restart the music once more. I didnt have to play the game to know that i had won. What could this game possibly offer me that can top what it had already delivered upon entering.\n\n10/10 Would Win Again","September 3, 2015","true","1.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","43","6","14","18","0"
