This makes it prone to network errors like never before. We all know Duels 2013 & 2014 had network problems. Now get ready for that, but about 5 times more than before. Not exaggerating.\n\nOrganising a 2HG game with just 1 friend is a complete and utter trainwreck. Try to play 4 games of 2HG with 1 friend; you will give up before you make it to 4. Now try with 3 friends. You'll want to stick forks in your eyes.\n\nThis is how bad it is:\n* Sometimes you finally manage to start the game and your friend has been put on the opposite team.\n* Sometimes you finish a game only to realise your friend hasn't finished. .... You weren't even in the same game, and you didn't know.\n\nWait.\n\nWhat?\n\nYes.\n\nReally.\n\nHow is that possible? How can you play a whole game and not realise your teammate is AI?\n\nThat's how bad it is! Because here's the utter brilliance of Stainless Steel's game design: they didn't just remove chat entirely, they also removed AI names upon AI takeover, so if someone's not a human, you can't tell. At all.\n\nAnd the beautiful part is that you don't even know. How many games have you played with a random human teammate?\n\nNow.... how many of those games were actually using an AI teammate? You don't know, do you?\n\nIt gets better.\n\nIn 2HG, if someone leaves, a message appears to tell you, then disappears. This message disappears automatically, and very quickly. So let's say you look out the window for 2 seconds, and someone leaves.\n\nYou have no way of knowing.\n\nBut wait. Let's say you look out the window for 2 seconds and someone _doesn't_ leave.\n\nYou still have no way of knowing.\n\nAnd then it dawns on you. If you ever, for a second, look away from the screen in 2HG, you're done. You're in the dark for the rest of the game. You honestly, no-lie, can not tell if players are human or AI. You are completely cut off; there's no way you can communicate anything to figure out if you're even having a game with a human. Years later, you still won't know.\n\nSo why aren't people making more of a stink about this? Because they can't tell it's happening. It's that legit. The only way I discovered that this happens is through Steam. If I'm playing with a random teammate, I will simply never know.\n\nAnd now I'm telling you, in 2016, this has still happened twice in one night. Scary, isn't it? This is literally starting to sound like a conspiracy theory, it's that idiotic.\n\nThe next 2HG game you play, you will wonder. And once you start wondering, you will realise just how bad it is. You have no way of knowing. You will never know.\n\n\n3 & 4 player FFA, gone.\nHold priority, gone.\nAI takeover toggle, gone.\n\nUn-confirming attackers or blockers if your teammate changes his attackers or blockers, also gone. Yeah that's never useful is it, especially when you can't even chat. If your teammate has already confirmed, you can't tell unless you confirm, and then it's too late.\n\n\n\nLike many others have said. Wizards, get rid of Stainless. Get some college team to do a better job than their crap, which just sheds features every year to the point where I feel like Will Ferrell saying "I'm not even mad, that's amazing!"\n\n\nBecause when I just now had a game where I couldn't chat to my team-mate in order to ask him if he was a human or not... I had to laugh. Stainless, you're amazing.\n\nWhat a fail.","July 30, 2015","false","138.7"," 1,134 of 1,347 people (84%) found this review helpful 183 people found this review funny","84","134","1","183","81"

They did NOT do that, they have missed every expansion release.\n\nWhen Stainless (the developers) missed out the MTG expansion 'Oath of the Gatewatch' completely (it wasn't late, they actually missed it), they tried to pass it off, they said instead of releasing this expansion, they would work on all the bugs and problems in the game, and then bundle that expansion with the next expansion 'Shadows Over Innistrad'.\n\nNow that Shadows Over Innistrad is here, we are all very disappointed,  the game has become almost unplayable.\n\nMTG has TWO main phases, if you have abilities on the board and/or instants in your hand, this client REMOVES both of your main phases.

This is the FIRST and ONLY time that Stainless has managed to release the game on time, and it is nearly unplayable.\n\nMTG is complex, you have to play around your opponent, now, you have to play around the game client as well.\n\nAs I type this, the Reddit Forum for this game is an orchestra of complaints.\n\nI love MTG - I want to love Duels, but, in its current state - I cannot recommend MTG Duels","April 9","false","497.4"," 254 of 313 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","254","313","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/recommended/316010/","Hybel","Couchfighter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/","236 products in account","General Impressions:\nUpdate 23/10/15: Just published a video review/letsplay/rant about the game also that can be viewed here, for anyone curious: https://youtu.be/XJrmefG17aw\n\nFree to play Magic: The Gathering presented in the style of the earlier 'Duels of the Planeswalkers' games.  No exclusive content that can't be earned with in game currency. The game uses a selection of cards from the latest 'Origins' set.\n\nMagic Duels is plagued with bugs, ranging from inexplicable launch errors preventing many from playing the game, to infinite loading screens and some instances of cards not following the rules.  There is also an unreasonable DX 11 hardware requirement which is plain sloppy programming, Duels could easily be software rendered.\n\nPlaying Duels online can really push my patience to its limits sometimes.  Matchmaking fails most of the time, I often have to search 5+ times before finding an opponent, and getting into a match of 2HG has been 100% impossible.  Players can avoid losing rank from losses very easily, making the whole mode a joke.  Also, people playing this better enjoy battling poor AI opponents, since whenever you play a person in any mode, if there's a slight connection hiccup of any kind or the server acts up, your opponent gets replaced with the AI.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend the game to anyone in its current state, it is simply not release ready and I'd strongly discourage anyone from spending real money in the game until drastic measures are taken by the developers to improve just about all aspects of the game.  Those desperate for a decent F2P MtG experience (such as myself) may be willing to forgive a lot of the shortcomings and problems this game suffers.  It is frustrating, there's potential for a lot of good MtG cardslinging with this release, but it needs SO much work to be considered a good game.\n\nUnfortunately I have little faith of Magic Duels recieving any of these much needed improvements simply because of the track record of the developer, Stainless Games, which despite imaginative boasts on their website are responsible for a lot of bad releases, from the recently released Carmageddon game which is a complete wreck (in all the wrong ways) to all the previous 'DotP' iterations, which ALL have had bugs and problems of varying magnitude that were never fixed.  The amateurish online functionality in particular is something that has plagued all the earlier versions of 'DotP' and never seen improvements.\n\n\nThe Good Stuff:\nFree to play MtG is in itself a very good thing.\n\nTutorials, while annoying for experts, do a good job of teaching the basics of MtG for new players and also provide a quick shot of ingame currency for booster packs.\n\nInviting interface, easy to play with either mouse or a controller.\n\nWhile you typically face certain easy to make deck types in online matches, the card selection is varied enough to allow for many diverse decks.\n\nVery fair monetization.  Collecting currency for booster packs is easy, and there are no direct advantages offered by paying real money, other than saving yourself time.\nThe Bad Stuff:\nBugs, bugs, bugs.  Cards become invisible, graphical glitches making either the table or your cards turn invisible or black, bugged cards that don't follow the rules.  Many can not launch the game, instead greeted with black screen or a crash.  Interface bugs, not allowing menu elements to be used, or making them flash up nonstop.\n\nThe online functionality is a complete mess.  The worst I have seen in a long time.  1v1 ranked matches often take 5-10 attempts before successfully finding and loading a match with an opponent, and getting a match of the popular 2 Headed Giant mode is even worse.  In a couple hours of repeatedly trying to play the mode I have not managed to get a single damn match going.  When I do get a 1v1 match going there are often lag spikes or constant lag, which can make you misplay cards or not be able to pause at critical moments to use instant abilities.  Servers are, still, very unstable and it is common to see your opponent get dropped from a game, very obvious when they suddenly drop out when they're just about to beat you.\n\nIn online matches, a bad AI takes over whenever opponents either get dropped, quit or concede from a match.  This is an insult, if my opponent scoops out I shouldn't have to keep fighting a second opponent, the match should be over.  No excuses for this.  Defenders say it is to prevent exploiting ingame currency farming but .. no.  Just, no.  It is extremely dull to so often have to battle the AI, and feels like the winner of the match is the one getting punished when the opponent quits.  Not to mention if the AI pulls a miracle and does a comeback and wins the match, the remaining player also loses gold and rank, an extra slap in the face considering the very real possibility the opponent quit the game with an exploit to prevent himself losing rank.\n\nThe online ranked structure itself is a complete joke.  Players start at rank 0 and climb/drop 1 rank per match. Rank 40 is max.  That's it.  So little thought went into the online structure it would be comical, if it wasn't so sad.  The ease of exploiting to save yourself from losing ranks further remove any semblance of accomlishment or prestige from climbing the ranked ladder.\n\nVery unreasonable hardware requirements.  Magic Duels requires both a DirectX 11 compatible video card, and a sound card to run, for no logical reason.  This is lazy programming for a simple looking turn based card game that could easily be programmed to be 100% cpu rendered.  The sound is also something many will just turn off, requiring a sound card to run the game is.. really weird.  On top of that the game lists as being Vista compatible, which it has been proven to absolutely not be.  (Vista users might want to think about updating soon, tho, just saying)\n\nDuels can be played on PC, Xbox One and Iphone/pad, but has no cross platform multiplayer, and not even a way to use the same account between the platforms.\n\n\nBut Couchfighter, why do you have so many hours on this game, or even play it right now if you don't like it? You silly goose!\nI'm so glad you asked, here's two reasons!\n\n1.  I still wanted to complete the current card set, and gather up some coins for the next release, in the small hope that Duels recieves the many improvements it needs.\n\n2.  In those cases when you actually get a working match without lag/bugs/crashes, Duels can be rather enjoyable indeed for a casual MtG enthusiast such as myself.\n\nDoes that make up for the myriad of big problems the game has, that some like to pretend don't exist? No, I'm afraid it doesn't.  If and when Duels gets the many fixes it needs I will be the first to turn that review thumb pointing the other way but until that happens, as a whole, I do not recommend Duels.","August 22, 2015","false","572.3"," 438 of 563 people (78%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","78","438","563","19","39"

Therefore, it may be invalid for (returning) veteran players.\n\nMagic Duels: Origins (a.k.a. Magic Duels) is the digital version of famous TCG (trading Card game); Magic: The Gathering. Unlike previous digital versions of the game, this game is designed as free to play (f2p). There is in-game coin and booster pack store. Booster packs can be bought with coin. Players can earn coin by winning, completing daily missions or buy it directly with real money. I find the store and amounts earned fair enough, because TCGs are based on spending money on new sets and booster packs by nature. Also, all cards are unlockable, so spending money is not mandatory.\n\nGame’s most noticeable part is its tutorial. It has an extensive tutorial showing the player every rule and beginning level gameplay of Magic: The Gathering. Its design is also nice. Unlike showing all aspects of the game in one go, it teaches the basics at the beginning and sends the player to the story mode. During story mode, if a situation arises such as a new type of card or an ability on a card, a notification asks the player if he/she wishes to play tutorial for it. Playing that tutorial pauses the current game and starts the tutorial. After tutorial is finished, interrupted game continues. It is possible to skip these tutorials and play them later from the menu. Every tutorial also gives a small amount of coin, so it is a good idea to complete them all.\n\nFirst “basics tutorial” and first story mission are kind of mandatory. Because most features are locked until they are finished. After that, the game sends the player to create his/her fist deck and lets the player to have a solo battle. When solo battle is finished all features are unlocked. This way of unlocking the features is not a problem for newbies. Actually it can even be considered a good choice to prevent newbies from losing in multiplayer too much, resulting them dropping the game. But for veterans, it is a big problem. They already know the game and want to jump right in multiplayer with their custom decks.\n\nOther than the story mode, game has solo battle mode which is against AI, versus mode which is against another player and two-headed giant mode which is 2 vs 2 mode against either AI or other players (The player needs to invite his/her friend to able play against AI).\n\nSolo battle can be played against 3 different difficulties. Interestingly though, “Hard” difficulty feels the easiest. These battles give coins depending on the difficulty (5 to 15 coins).\n\nVersus mode can be played against either a friend or an opponent that is ranked the same as the player. The rank of the player changes depending on the result of the matched battle. Battles against friends and AI don’t affect ranking. Also battles against friends don’t give coins. Matched versus battles gives 20 coins.\n\nTwo headed giant mode is the only multiplayer mode where more than two players play together. 4 players split into two teams of two players and battle. Team players share the life and a player can block an attack against his/her teammate. A Player’s teammate’s hand is visible but interacting with it is not allowed. This also apply cards on the board. Players can’t use abilities on their teammates cards. Two-headed giant mode doesn’t affect ranking. It also doesn’t give coins.\n\nUI is good and clear. There are no unnecessary animations or information bombard. Most of the in-game actions (such as attack animations of the cards) can be toggled in the settings. That said, I read veterans don’t like this UI. Until “Magic 2014” it was different, and indeed there are big changes. When I checked 2014 version myself, I realized that both button locations and general information design had big differences. For a newbie, it won’t matter. Actually I like the new one more. In the old UI, it felt weird not to be able see how many cards my opponent had in his/her hand. For veterans though, it will feel like switching from Mac OS to Windows.\n\nIt appears that previous editions had also chat feature and it was removed in this version. There are mixed opinions on this subject. Personally, I don’t think it is a must have but it certainly could be useful, especially in two-headed giant mode. it is impossible to talk to teammate if the player is playing together with a random player. That said, if the player is playing with a friend, he/she can use steam chat to overcome this.\n\nBooster packs contains 3 common cards, 2 uncommon cards and 1 rare or mythic rare card (total 6 cards). Also packs can’t drop the cards that reached its deck limit so eventually every card is unlocked. Every booster pack is 150 coins. Winning against hard AI gives 15 coins and winning against a player gives 20 coins. Daily missions and weekly mission give 40 coins (there are up to 3 daily missions and one weekly mission). It is said that about 80 booster packs are required to unlock all cards. But there is a daily coin limit (400 coins) so players can’t grind coins (note that daily missions are not counted towards the limit).\n\nDuring my gameplay, I came across one serious and one minor bug. Serious bug was that during my solo battle against the easy AI, it played 5 of the same card which is clearly against the game rules. (Note: a developer responded to my screenshot of this issue and wrote that they were going to investigate it). Minor bug was that the coin amount was not being updated after completion of the daily missions. It required (and still does) a restart to be fixed.\n\nI didn’t have any issues finding opponents in both versus mode and two-headed giant mode. Also my test for steam friend invite worked without any issues (I need to note that I tested friend invite with only one of my friends, so it might be just luck).\n\nPros:+ Extensive Tutorial: This is very good for newbies to Magic: The Gathering game.\n+ Same Drop Limit: Thanks to this limit, all cards are eventually unlocked.\n+ Simplistic: All menus and buttons are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner. (Although, there are big changes)\n\nCons:- Mandatory Single Play: This is only a con for veterans. As a side effect of the tutorial, some single play elements must be finished before multiplayer modes are unlocked.\n- Daily Coin Cap: Normally this is not a very big issue. But because of the ability to buy coins with real money, this creates a “pay to win” side.\n\nVerdict:I can safely assume that Magic Duels is designed to make new players interested in Magic: The Gathering title and not as a solo product to make money. Due to its extensive tutorial, it is very easy to learn the basics of Magic: The Gathering. As a newbie to the title myself, I can recommend this to everyone who wants to learn (or at least try) Magic: The Gathering.\n\n\nP.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide (Note: this game is f2p but has in-game shop to buy coins so the rule still applies).\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos","November 18, 2015","true","34.1"," 191 of 235 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","191","235","7","9"

I cannot recommend this game either now, or when I first reviewed it.\n\nIMPORTANT N.B : This game, as of the latest patch(April 2016 - Shadows Over Innistrad) is borderline unplayable, due a severe bug having been introduced concerning the way that priority and turn progression are handled in game(the game will automatically skip main phases, if you only have instant speed plays available). The bug in question has broken many of the game's available cards and mechanics. Players with some prior experience with Magic The Gathering might find the following links particularly interesting, as well as new players who are keen on learning how to play Magic :-\n\n- Wizards Announcement about Priority Bug\n\n- Devs--this is why your new priority system does not work.\n\n- Hold Priority Bug Is TOP PRIORITY bug fix guys!\n\n- New Priority Passing was a design decision\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCNrlVjzBfk\nPlease take a moment to contact Wizards directly by email and report this bug to them( wizardscusthelp@wizards.com ), Facebook( https://www.facebook.com/magicduels ) and Twitter( https://twitter.com/magic_duels ). Please also contribute to the debate on Duels' Subreddit and here in Duels' Steam discussion group. Thanks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nMajor Problems I have encountered with this game so far :-\n\nAfter using my gold to buy boosters to complete sets, I was not given the boosters I paid for. This was made worse by the fact that I paid for my gold with real money.\n\nNumerous cards have been bugged or broken with each release and have been left unfixed for 3 or more months, which has been the frequency thus far, at which the developers release patches.\n\nThe game has a tendency to randomly hang mid-turn when playing vs matches against human opponents online, requiring you to either concede and lose rank, or terminate the game's process and restart the game.\n\nThe game on occasion prevents you from stopping the phase transition clock, which can prevent you from casting spells.\n\nAfter the last patch(April 2016 - Shadows Over Innistrad), they broke all decks players had built prior to update, in such a way that would leave the game hanging indefinitely whilst loading solo A.I. matches. This required players to delete all their decks and rebuild them all from scratch.\n\nTrying to connect to a vs match against somebody online usually takes between 5 and 15 minutes, with the game either repeatedly disconnecting for no reason, or hanging in an unrecoverable way that requires the player to terminate the game's process and restart the game.\n\nAnti-aliasing and shadow casting in the game has been broken since launch. This makes the edges in game geometry(e.g. cards) jagged and shadows appear as solid black blocks.\n\nThere are also many minor problems the game either has, or has had that are too numerous to list here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game's development and release cycle thus far :-\n\nThey released the game at the end of July 2015. The game was due to receive the Battle For Zendikar update late September, Wizards announced on release day that the update had been delayed indefinitely, they didn't provide a future date. The Battle For Zendikar update was eventually released late November, they didn't announce its release, they simply announced the game was going into extended maintenance and went ahead and did it. The game was due to receive the Oath Of The Gatewatch update mid to late January, but the update was delayed until April to coincide with the Shadows Over Innistrad release, the game received no bug patches between November and April either. Both the Oath Of The Gatewatch and Shadows Over Innistrad updates were released early April, this update introduced more bugs than it fixed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Analysis :-\n\nAlmost every update released for this game has been delayed, bug patches have been infrequent and low impact.\n\nThis game violates multiple rules of paper Magic The Gathering. Turn phases do not work the same way, there is no upkeep phase for example, which renders some spells less effective. The game does not permit 4 of any non basic land card to be played in a deck as per constructed rules, instead, card count is restricted by rarity. 1x Mythic, 2x Rare, 3x Uncommon, 4x Common. This causes severe balancing issues to occur, because all of the cards featured in this game, are designed and play tested around the common rule that up to 4 copies of any card may be played.\n\nSet releases are incomplete, they do not release every card in each set, with between a third and a half of each set excluded, this further causes balancing issues and substantially reduces the quality of the content this game has to offer, as many fun, low impact cards are excluded, as well as some of the more popular cards each set has to offer.\n\nThe game features a collection of starter box cards from many past and present sets and because these cards have not been balanced, or developed alongside recent set releases; which consist mostly of current Standard legal cards, they can and have caused severe balancing issues that are left unfixed for months on end between updates, this can make the game tedious and repetitive to play. This problem would be substantially less severe, if they invested more time into analyzing the impact the cards in question are likely to have on the format and/or if they more frequently patched the game.\n\nWizards of the Coast, who own the Magic The Gathering franchise, are notoriously averse to investing in or committing to products that deviate from their core business, which is paper Magic The Gathering. Because of this, Magic Duels does not presently have the resources either financial, human or otherwise to become the successful, feature rich digital trading card game that long term players such as myself know it can be, and until this changes, this game will not fulfill its potential.\n\nThere have been recent indications(2015 / 2016) that their attitude towards digitizing their game may be evolving to a degree, but as things presently stand, this game seems to have only minimal support of its owners ergo, its long term future looks bleak, which should be foremost on your mind if you intend to buy content or invest substantial amounts of your time into collecting cards and building decks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion :-\n\nHaving devoted nearly a thousand hours of my time to this game, I am regretfully going to have to walk away from it, at least until they fix the Hold Priority bug introduced in the latest update(April 2016 - Shadows Over Innistrad), which has caused widespread malfunction throughout its cards and mechanics.\n\nOn the whole, I cannot recommend this game, either to players who are new to Magic The Gathering, or to experienced long term players. I would especially advise players looking to use Magic Duels to learn how to play paper Magic The Gathering to steer clear, because the two are significantly different.\n\nBottom line... Keep an eye on this game, its owners may well get behind it at some point in the future and if they do, it'll become truly great, but right now(2016) your time would be better invested elsewhere.","April 13","false","067.1"," 98 of 108 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","98","108","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/recommended/316010/","verticalcleave","landwhale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/","831 products in account","By some miracle of ineptitude, Magic Duels somehow manages to be worse than DotP 2015 across the board. In terms of game design, gameplay content, the cash shop, and even down to the card selection, this is by far the worst work by Stainless Games yet. Wizards need to seriously re-evaluate their digital presence and either needs to find a new studio to work on these games or stop making them altogether.\n\nGone are the extra game modes, challenges, and even campaign deck construction of previous years. Instead, we have a 20 mission campaign (with unadjustable difficulty) with tutorials sprinkled throughout that can only be played with uneditable decks that get "upgraded" after completing missions. How are they upgraded? It's hard to tell, since most of them are very bad from the start and the game doesn't tell you what changes it makes to your deck. Gideon's deck is the most playable and even that is just dumping your hand and turning everything sideways. I get the feeling that they thought that cramming the challenges of old DotP games into this game's campaign would be a good idea but it really doesn't work. This campaign is (once again!) a terrible introduction to MTG for new players since it ignores deck construction, has a locked difficulty, and has many purposefully unbalanced fights.\n\nOnce you finish the very short singleplayer content, you have the incredibly deep and rewarding online play to look forward to. 2-Headed Giant is back! ...But you can't get coin rewards from it. There's a ladder system and matchmaking system finally! ...But server/game crashes and disconnects will give you no rewards. You can quickly play games through Steam invites with your friends! ...But there's no rewards. Playing MTG is fun and all but its frustrating when everyone is playing with the same trash and new boosters are hard to come by because of the stingy cash shop system. Even if you do decide to sink some cash into this game, you're only getting SIX cards per booster! Physical MTG boosters, while in all honesty are meant to be played in Sealed or Draft and not solely to be cracked for value, at least have 15 cards in them for a MSRP of $4. At the worst conversion rate, you're looking at spending $2 for a six card booster. At $39.99 for 7500 coins, you're spending roughly $0.80 per six card booster... but at this point why not spend your $40 on actual MTG cards (or a new video game)? The worst part about this is that even if you do get the most bang for your buck with the coins, you are still gambling on boosters and aren't guaranteed to unlock every card.\n\nOpening overpriced boosters might be acceptable if they had anything worth playing inside of them. Origins is the worst core set I have ever played with, full of worse version of old cards that are purposefully designed to be weaker and/or bad. This set has the format design of MM2015 (which was also terrible to actually play with and people just rare drafted it) and the mechanics design of Theros (Renown is an obvious leftover from Theros's crap keywords). Do not waste your money on physical or digital boosters of this product.\n\nIt amazes me why Wizards hates money so much. I understand they want people to dump their money into either physical product or the digital variants available on MTGO, but then why release a barebones mobile game every YEAR then? These games make the MTG brand look bad (because MTGO is poorly advertised) and with every annual release, the DotP series is on the front of everyone's desks. Did reviewers see the improvements to MTGO's UI and layout during its last upgrade? Not really, because MTGO has been out for 13 years. Did reviewers see Stainless drop a complete turd the past two years, with more content stripped from each annual release and with more cash grab attempts built in? Even if reviewers haven't, the playerbase sure has noticed it judging by Steam reviews.\n\nWizards needs to wake up and find a new dev to work on these games. Stainless has been dragging their ♥♥♥ since the beginning of the DotP series; releasing cookie-cutter annual rehashes with slightly different cards every year, and with recent years actually removing content. Even with being a free2play CCG, this isn't worth your time because of the cut content, lack of polish, always-online connectivity, and incredibly stingy rewards for online play.","August 2, 2015","false","10.1"," 556 of 770 people (72%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","72","556","770","37","28"

This basically means that I cycle through my entire deck, casting random spells and deal dmg all over the place to enemies in all directions.

I remember equipping Basillisk Collar onto a pestilence demon, accidentally clearing the entire board and gain over 100 hp in the process. Events like these seem neigh impossible with the current cards implemented. It's all just very... Tedious...\n\nDoes this mean you won't appreciate the game?\nIf you can enjoy competitive play no matter what kind of deck you're playing and if you can actually get the game working, sure why not?\n\nBut I can't recommend this to you.\n\n","July 30, 2015","false","3.7"," 301 of 412 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","301","412","13","0"

There are a lot of drops when trying to connect with an opponent, which is quite annoying.  I have not encountered, but have seen reported, a slew of other connectivity concerns,\n-In game bugs.  While somewhat consistent, there are times when the game bugs out pretty severely.  I had an issue where I got locked into a zoom in on a card which caused me to lose a game.\n-While I have not encountered this issue, there have been reports that cards have disappeared from collections, including from purchased packs.\n\nAnnoyances (less major issues):\n\n-Opponent concessions.  When your opponent concedes the game, they are then replaced with an AI opponent.  If you happen to lose to that opponent, you receive a loss and drop in rank.  When an opponent concedes, this should be treated as if you have won the match.\n-Daily quests.  All the quests I have encountered reward 40 coins, which is a fine reward for most quests.  However, some quests require twice the number of wins as other quests, sometimes with the same parameters.  For example, yesterday I had two quests that both rewarded 40 coins.  On required me to win 2 games with a Blue Red deck, while the other required me to win 4.  The coin reward for these more time consuming quests should be greater.\n-"Archetype" quests.  Quests ask you to win with archetype decks.  However, these decks cannot be entirely of your own design.  Instead, you have to work your way through the aided deck construction generator which, while great for beginners, is pretty limiting for experienced players.  This is especially the case due to the fact that this deck generation only works on the cards you already own.  So, if you have a quest for a color combination for which you lack strong cards, you're in a bad spot.  I would rather these quests allow all the cards you own and individual deck creation or pull from additional cards that you do not yet own that make these archetype decks a bit more consistent.\n-Deck construction UI.  Minor concern, but it is a pain to make decks in the advanced deck creation UI.  The inability to sort cards once they've been added to the deck is annoying.  I'd like to be able to lay my deck out, or at least get more statistics about my deck before I finalize it.\n-Land selection. Another minor concern, but the art on your lands are essentially randomly assigned.  If you'd like to have only one design on your lands, you're out of luck.\n\nLike I said at the top, there is a lot of potential in this game, but I don't think it's worth spending any real money on just yet.","August 9, 2015","false","27.0"," 135 of 176 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","135","176","8","0"

As is would not recommend at all.  Some examples:\n\nUI:\n--  UI is laggy.  When leaving a menu you have to wait several seconds before you can actually click anything.\n--  When popups with choices come up, like those for Desecration Demon, the selection screen blocks the play area, and there is no way to move it aside or peek at your board.  Once you make your choice there's no going back.\n--  No voice acting or sound in the cutscenes.  Very awkward.\n--  Clicking the text for an option does not work.  It has been standard in games for years now, that clicking the text also clicks the box.  You don't realize how annoying not having this is, until you play a game like this one where it's gone.\n--  You can't separate the opponent's land to see which ones they have.\n\nGameplay:\n--  The AI is bad.  It will do stuff like Languish it's own board when you have no creatures.\n--  They want to charge for cards, but the deck restrictions aren't the same as magic.\n--  There's no way to see what's in your deck when you start a story mission.  Very annoying.\n--  The reaction interface is very bad.  Most games let you skip to next turn, skip to next main phase, etc.  This one has a 5 second timer and then it plows ahead.  It's not clear whether or not you are reacting or if you're in one of the main phases.  The order battles are resolved is arbitrary instead of standard magic rules.\n--  Large AI slowdowns for seemingly simple play states.  Not sure why sometimes it takes the computer 30s to decide what to play on turn 2.\n\nGraphics:\n--  Very ugly presentation.  Small cards on a large bland playmat.  No colors or customization options.\n--  Minimal interface, but no unifying theme or artistic direction.\n\nOverall a very poor implementaiton of Magic.  I'd recommend the official MTG client over this.

Almost all dual lands are given to you at the start and foiling all copies of a card only costs 5 gold (regardless of rarity). Buying boosters costs around 1-2$ per pack depending on the rate and exchange ratio.\n- Expect decent content updates: it's promised that this version of the game will be constantly updated with around 70-80% of the cards from each new block of card releases (every 3 months).\n- AI has access to every card so there is / will be massive variety even with single player play, and the AI's deck you play against are randomized every time you play.\n- AI is proficiently programmed in regards to most keywords (more on that below).\n- Two-Headed Giant is back.\n- Full deck building: Want to make that Penta-colour deck filled with bombs and flavor of the month? Now you can!\n- A very good tutorial system: The tutorial teaches you the basics through game play, when new keywords pop up during a campaign, you are often given the choice of jumping into a short tutorial scenario (half a minute to a minute) for the keyword to earn some free gold, or you can just skip them all together.\n\nThe ambiguous:\n- Rarity restrictions: 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares, 1 Mythic. This restricts the potential power and consistency of decks and requires different planning of cards, but also in a way reduces the potential Mythic bombs and makes the disadvantage for newcomers smaller.\n- Two-Headed Giant and duels with friends grants no gold, understandable from a F2P perspective.\n- AI takes over for players if someone concedes.\n- A basic campaign that's atleast better than most I've seen from online tcg's, with a story, custom artwork, and a cutscene at the end.\n- UI is mostly functional but also lack customization options.\n- 30 deck slots.\n\nThe cons:\n- Attrocious launch, disconnects, and bugs for alot of people.\n- No trading.\n- No cross-play between platforms.\n- Always-online requirements.\n- Chatting is gone (though some might consider this a positive).\n- Lobbies are gone.\n- No FFA / 3v3 / 4v4 / additional formats.\n- You have to finish the game against the AI after someone concedes if you want the gold reward.\n- The AI programming is flawed when it comes to dropping creatures on second main phase even if it has an ability that impacts the board prior to combat phase.\n- The deck builder could be improved upon with more sort and filter options.\n\nAll in all I see alot of potential in this title as the card pool increases and bugs get ironed out. For me the full deck building aspect, decent amount of card slots, decent solo experience, and the F2P model was enough to sway me over to bear with the launch server problems and other bugs.

There is literally nothing to do apart from grinding your teeth in 1v1.\nLadder climbing is yet again pointless and not rewarded with anything.\n\nGrind fest.\nYou must pay (~60$) or play 5 hours a day for a month to purchase all cards for gold thanks to gold earned per day limitation.\n\nCard base is tiny.\nWe have only ONE BASIC set. Avalible cards yet again are poor compared to what we could expect leading to the fact that we are limited to like 3 competitive deck techs from one archetype. That's unacceptable and boring.\n\nStupid deck limitation.\nYou can put 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares and 1 mythic in a deck. Feels like entry level tournament restrictions towards experienced players and towards overall entertainment from the game.\n\nQuest system is awfully implemented.\nFirst, 40g avg. per day feels way too low when 6 random cards will cost you 150.\nSecondly, you get credit only if you constructed deck via manager. And yes, you won't get any reward for playing with a friend.\n\nInterface is utter ♥♥♥♥.\nYou can ez skip your attack because of poor implementation. You need to confirm almost every step. UI itself is built for consoles and feels pointless when playing on PC.\nThere are some annoying flaws like you need to chose your deck every time you want to play it. Apparently it's hard to save player choice in 2015.\n\nLoad times are terrible.\nEvery time action take place there is a few second wait time. Can't see a reason behind such a time waste.\n\nCampaign is short and boring.\n25 duels with almost basic decks is too much. Let's take Jace campaign. You will play 5 matches with mill deck in a row which is utterly boring considering 2 matches are mill vs. mill!\n\nYou can't skip tutorial.\nEven if you're pro. Even if you're played MTG for more than 10 years. You just can't. On top of that I highly doubt it will teach newbie something apart from point and clicking where the pointer is.

There is no confidence in not having such issues in future.\n\nSummary:\nAvoid this product. Play MTGO or DotP 2013 (even Shandalar 1997 from MicroProse is way better) if you're a fan of MTG. Especially if you're planning to spend money for cards.\nIf you're new to the genre and want to give your brain some practice, have a look on Heartstone.

A short campaign in this game is fine in my opinion but if you want some sort of replayable long campaign, this is not the game. Also after your first run it does not give you anymore coins making it a waste of time, if you could still get some sort of income from it, i would of replayed it a few times. Some of the individual stories are good, and the charactors actions make sense and i can see someone reacting that way to the situation, but some parts seem a little random/forced and it's obvious they didnt put too much thought into them, but i don't think anyone plays magic for the campaign/story so that's not too bad. Also during one of the stages of the elf campaign there are cards that are in the game but you cant see or unlock them any where else meaning they are holding back content from launch, which is something that literally anyone, ANYONE would tell you that is a really bad thing to do that no one likes, but because of the lack of cards this could be due to balance as those cards are OP compared to all the current cards ingame, but seeing as how they were in past games if they just had all the cards from those games they wouldn't be OP beacuse they were balanced in those.\n\nOn to the Multiplayer, the removal of lobbies is one of the worst things they have done to the Magic games, it makes 2v2s with a friend almost impossible, either one person gets an error or both do or an endless loading screen. Now when i say they removed lobbies, that's not exactly what they did, they made it so you don't have an option of hosting a game, or joining one and it just instantly starts. If it makes you host one (happens beyond rarely) it works 95% of the time, the other 5% you are on other teams (how does that even happen?) and when it tries to make you join a game the person you invited will have to reselect his deck and somehow that breaks it and he can no longer join, and the person who invited him either gets a loading screen for 20+ seconds that ends with an error or he gets put in a game with a random person on your team that you are either forced to play with or dodge the game and make him play with a AI (which makes me feel bad doing that) talking about playing with a random person in 2v2s, you can't see their deck before the game starts so you have no idea if you guys will be a good match together until the game starts (No chat doesnt help either), and if you aren't it's too late. Also because theres no true lobby, there is no way to rematch someone which is bad in a versus game based on RNG, some people would like to play the same person again because they lost cause of a bad draw, and wants to see if their deck is actually better in a larger sample size. In the older games you could change your deck and fight the same person again which was also great. Another thing is there is no chat box. I can understand not having voice chat, but no chat box? Having no communication in a multiplayer game like this is beyond silly, especially in 2v2s, talking to your teammate is a really good thing this game should have, the multiplayer is so incomplete and bugged. I don't understand why they didn't think to add those features and how those bugs even got pass one day of testing.\n\nSo 2v2s are impossible to play over 95% of the time, this is so broken i have no idea how they did that, seriously.\nThe 1v1s are perfectly fine and work as it should, so atleast thats something.\n\nNow we'll talk about unlocking cards and content ingeneral.\nI really, really don't like the lock on how many coins you can get a day, it's a really hard cap too. Instead of having a cap they should have had a lesser percentage for the day based on how many coins you have gotten, i'd rather them have\nnothing but they wont do that cause they need to make money somehow (boosters), they are a business so you can't expect them to not have some sort of money grab in a f2p game. Speaking of boosters, i feel like they should have color themed Boosters but i can see how that wouldn't be necessary as of right now due to the lack of cards which is a bad thing, moving onto that...\nI don't like how most of the cards in the previous games aren't in this one, i don't get why they would do that, but intime im pretty sure they will all be back, but until then that's a huge, HUGE thing that's horrible, game's should not remove core content from previous games, it's devolving and just not right. Now the gameplay is great, if you like the way magic works, you'll like it, it's simple really, it's a shame the rest of the game isn't good enough to match the perfectly good gameplay, it would make this the best sorce of playing Magic.\n\nAlso a little bug that i think is worth mentioning cause i really hate it when games do this, if you have lowered the in-game sound it does not change the opening game sounds and keeps them at full, this is very, very annoying as it is really loud compared to other sound sorces on my PC when im just on it doing my regular stuff. (teamspeak, twitch, background music)\n\nConclusion, this game can be, and hopefully will be good. But as it is, it's way too buggy and missing a lot of things for me to recommend it to anyone unless they understand what they are getting into. I'm going to rate the game itself and the gameplay differently, cause the gameplay is so much better compared to the rest of the game that it would raise the rating of the whole game overall but i don't think it should because it's so broken, and if i rated it too low it wouldn't be fair to the gameplay.\n\nMagic Duels: Origins - 2/10,  Way too broken, and a pretty bad economy with removed content from previous games, and missing a lot of features that have become standard in most games, i would not play it AT ALL if it was not for the core gameplay.\n\nGameplay: 8/10, Would be perfect if not for the lack of cards or when you are alt-tabbed the timer bar gets frozen and that no one knows that they should turn off battle effects (Please turn them off, it makes the game smoother and quicker making the gameplay overall a better experience) and that the game has poor controller support, which is weird seeing as how it's on console too.","September 6, 2015","false","101.7"," 91 of 125 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","91","125","0","0"

I am a very good and experienced magic online player and I have over 300 hours of gameplay in this particular free magic variant so my review will be a critique as opposed to a casual opinion. After 300 hours of gameplay, I decided to write the longest review I've ever made about my experienced opinion as I have strong feelings that my review is 100% accurate. If you disagree with anything I have said, leave a comment before you rate and I will happily counter discuss with you.\n\nReview\nThis card game is functional versus the AI and one online player but fails to be consistent in 2 headed giant mode[2HG]; the most prominent part of the game for many gamers where up to 4 players are supported. This is because match-making in this game (and all previous magic games) is utterly terrible with endless error messages and a host system which doesn't work 50%~ of the time. Teaming up with a friend is a nightmare; half the time you don't get a friendly match made or your friend is on the opposing team which causes lots of players to leave out of frustration, thereby ruining this game mode.\n\nI don't recommend this game if you like playing with a friend on your team as it's a big hassle endlessly inviting friends in the hope that you will get a game eventually. However, if Stainless hire more competent programmers, they can potentially have a good multiplayer experience card game but as it stands.....the 2-headed giant multiplayer experience is a nightmare and it really shouldn't be.\n\nThis is the main reason why I don't recommend this game to everyone, especially those who enjoy playing with friends like I do.\n\nAssuming there are no error messages in this game (which is rare), many other aspects of this game work fine outside of 2HG.\n\nPros\n1) Free magic card experience\n2) Decently good card sets\n3) Nice card art\n4) Decently good single player experience\n5) Most card interactions work as they should\n\nCons\n1) 2HG matchmaking system.\n2) 2HG host system, error messages and network errors.\n3) Earning coins to buy booster packs is a long and tedious grind.\n4) No rewards for 2HG. How pathetic... Fixed.\n5) Minimizing or tabbing out of a 2HG game will force other players to leave after a small amount of time which forces you to play versus the AI which is utterly stupid.\n6) Unfair advantages can be gained by anyone who buys coins to get better cards and therefore better decks. I'm not saying this is a pay to win game but it certainly helps the buying player.\n7) Deck organisation is terrible; it should be a 1 click process to pick a deck...\n8) The AI frequently makes very silly decisions which reduces the difficulty for advanced players like myself.\n9) No ranked 2-Headed Giant game mode.\n10) No 1v1 or 2HG leaderboards. (If you do implement it, at least make it work this time please)\n\nConclusion\nStainless Games simply have bad programmers! This problem has been going on for too long and the game developers need to address this massive problem as soon as possible if they want to keep their fan base.\n\nWizards & Stainless Games could have a great card game if they addressed these aforementioned problems in my review but as it stands, it's severely bugged and suboptimal. A better name for their company, given their track record of highly bugged games would be Stainless Magic Bugs!\n\n11 May 2016 BUGGED CARDS Review Update\n1) Jace, Vryn's Prodigy does not exile cards on -3 ability.\n2) Kozilek's Return will deal 5 damage to all creature even if you press no..\n3) Abbot Of Keral Keep does not let you cast from exile many of the new cards.\n4) Disciple Of The Ring's tap ability does not work.\n5) Fevered Visions deals 2 damage to opponent's planeswalkers ?\n6) Abbot land casting will not work if you don't have a land to play in your hand or your partner has nothing to play.","February 16","false","510.9"," 188 of 287 people (66%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","66","188","287","29","26"

I also played through the tutorial and got my first story quest/mission done. I really liked the heartstone vibe they gave the game. I have some cool information I was able to gather while I played and can share with those waiting for the game to be fixed:\n\n- When you start the game you can get a free starter pack at the store that gives you 20/22 cards of each color to make your own decks and lands to go along with them.\n\n- Right now there are 18 pages of 12 cards each ingame... so around 216 cards to collect and make decks at launch.\n\n- First Boosters are called Origins Boosters and are priced as follows: 1x150g, 2x300g, 8x1200g, 20x3000g. Each booster has 6 cards.\n\n- You can foil cards for 5G and it foils all cards of that type you have.\n\n- You can get Gs ingame... first tutorial quest gives you 30g and first full main story campaign gives 150G (that's the only one I have unlocked sorry)...\n\n- You can get Gs online by playing against other players or against bots: 5g vs easy, 10g vs medium or 15g vs hard. (I couldn't play against other players)\n\n- The game has an option to play with a fully custom made deck or it has a deck wizard that helps you make the kind of deck you want with the cards you have (that I found quite good)\n\n- Pricing for Gs on the store is as follows: 150g x 2us$ (1 booster), 500g x 5us$, 1250g x 10us$, 3750g x 25us$ or 7500g x 40us$.\n\nI never played too much Magic before but I really liked what I saw here... not too flashy animation wise but functional... I hope game gets fixed as soon as possible so all can try it. Right now I can recommend this game, it looked fun and  free... gold didn't seem that difficult to get too and there are lots of carts to start.","July 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 115 of 170 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","115","170","0","0"

It is (has become) very rewarding, the powerlevel is fairly balanced, I really enjoy the dailiy quests, you won't get reduntant cards in your boosters once you hit that cards total, it is very beginner friendly and a great way to learn the game while still being enjoyable for experienced players (apart form the auto skipping)\n\nThen why the negative review? Because the game HAS TO REMOVE the auto phase skipping, this is a signal boost.\nAgain, I do understand the reasoning behind the change but then at least make it OPTIONAL for experienced players to end phases manually.\n\nIf the developers actually cared about speeding up Gameplay please do so by removing the option to watch damage effetcs. THIS is slowing down the game, not the manual phase skipping.","May 10","false","192.2"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","39","46","2","1"

Doesn't matter if you are a new player who wants to try MTG or an old ex-player trying to scratch that MTG itch.\n\nGOOD\n+ It's free. You get a set of basic cards and earn gold for playing campaign missions, duels against the AI or online against other players. You can buy gold for real money to speed up the process of getting cards but it's not necessary.\n\n+ The tutorial is very good. First it teaches you the basics so you can start playing the game as soon as possible. Then while playing the campaign, every time a new mechanic appears the game pauses and asks you if you want to play a mini-tutorial about that mechanic or skip it.\n\n+ Deck creation: You can make your own decks using any cards you may have, unlike old Magic games on Steam where creating new decks was very limited.\n\n+ Growing pool of cards. When the game was launched the card pool was very limited, but now with 3 expansions in addition to the original set the pool is getting big.\n\nMEH\n~ Deck creation interface: With the card pool getting bigger and bigger, creating a new deck takes more time than it should. The deck creation interface needs a rework.\n\n~ No chat. Would be nice to be able to talk to the other player. But then again you avoid the flames and you can always talk through Steam when playing with friends.\n\n~ Game won't run on some (old?) integrated graphic cards. Black screen on my old laptop, seems to be a common problem looking at the forums.\n\nBAD\n- The latest major patch (April 2016) introduced a change on how the priority system works. The devs have explained it's to make the game faster and easier to understand to newcomers, but it doesn't make any sense: the game won't hold priority for instants and automatically skip phases. This means if you only have instants the game won't allow to play them in certaion situations where you should be able. This doesn't make the game simpler for newbies, exactly the opposite, they won't understand what the f*ck is happening. EVEN WORSE; this change breaks the amazing interactive tutorial in a way that some parts of the tutorial can't even be completed anymore. The game is still worth it and I recommend it but hopefully this change will be reverted sooner than later.","April 17","true","234.4"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","41","50","0","0"

I dislike ones that are long winded.\n\nFirst off, I love Magic the Gathering even tho I'm far from running on the pro circuit.\n\nI'll start with the positive:\n\nThe game is fun, and a lot of enjoyment for someone that is not playing with $200 decks for paper cards.  There are some good cards in game for the casual player that work well off each other.  If you play Magic on the kitchen table with some friends, then there are fun matches to be had.\n\nThe cons:\n\nIt's a grind and wasted time.  The booster packs you can buy with coins (in-game money) cost 150 coins and you get only six cards per pack.  I believe the pack break down is three commons, two uncommon and one rare.  Early in the game you can earn some boosters to add to your collection after running through the story mode and the free cards they give, I have only 254 cards.\n\nOnce the story mode is completed the main way to earn more coins is playing against other random players and if you win you will earn 20 coins.  I'm fine with that, the game is free so I don't expect to earn coins too quickly.  Here is the kicker, if you lose then you earn nothing.  I've played two matches online and between both of them I spent an over an hour and earned zero coins because I lost.\n\nYou can also play against the AI with three difficulty setting easy (5 coins), medium (10 coins) and hard (15 coins).  So this is even a slower way to earn coins.\n\nLastly there are "quest" to complete.  They are things like "attack with five creatures at a time, five different times" or "counter 20 spells."  for what I've seen they net 20-40 coins each.  But the quest may be for deck you don't enjoy playing, so you may not enjoy the game when running certian quest.\n\nAlso you can buy coins for real money and here is the break down in how much money will get you coins to buy a certain amount of packs and the cost of each pack.  That's a hard read but there it goes:\n\n$1.99 = 150 coins = 1 pack = each pack cost $1.99\n$4.99 = 500 coins = 3 packs = each pack cost $1.67\n$9.99 = 1250 coins = 8 packs = each pack cost $1.25\n$24.99 = 3750 coins = 25 packs = each pack cost $1.00\n$39.99 = 7500 coins = 50 packs = each pack cost $0.80\n\nAnd there are no trading or selling of cards in the game.\n\nIf  you want to learn Magic, the game does that very well.  If you are a causal player, there is some fun.  If you are an experienced player this will not be the game for you.","August 4, 2015","false","72.9"," 150 of 231 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","150","231","9","8"

Pieces of the Puzzle does not work on Instants like it should but only on Sorceries and 2. Visions of Brutality has a wrong text that says it can't attack, but actually it can only not block (german version).)\n\n-3 times so far, the game crashed to desktop with the error message "Unknown error".\n\n-uncounted many times so far, joining a friend's game is impossible unless you restart the game.\n\n-When Co-Oping with a friend, the Twoheaded Giant Mode can not in any way be played against humans. Only bots.\nYou can, formally, search for Twoheaded Opponents, but it never ever finds a match. And if it does find one, it is.... [surprise!] against "Opponent and Opponent(1)", the bot names. Yes you read me right. You will find the normal Bots in matchmade multiplayer matches just as if you would have clicked on "Play Against AI"\n\n-The game itself is somewhat a skinner-box. It feeds you small amounts of coins to buy boosters now and then, triggering a habit in your brain to want more coins, so that you will pay money for them.\n\n-Speaking of boosters, you find only 6 cards in the boosters. Yes. Six. 3 Commons, 2 Uncommons and a Rare. After about 20 Boosters from a single Edition, there are still Commons from it that I dont have a single one from, and I dont have any 4-card-playset of Commons that can be pulled from boosters. After about 20 Boosters from a single Edition. A Booster costs about 1,70 € or 150 Coins, which is essentially 5 won multiplayer games.\n\n-Aaand speaking of coins, when battling a twoheaded game with a friend, you dont earn your quest rewards. To get the quest rewards the game FORCES you to play alone. I guess they went for a community that has a reputation of antisocial awkwardness...\n\n-The Main phase gets removed completely if you dont have any cards in hand that can only be played in Main Phase. Sounds good but it isn't, because some instant spells and abilities can potentially put mainphase cards in your hand. "Vessel of Volatility" gets totally annihilated by this, because the mana gets removed instantly if used incorrectly, because of how the game is programmed. There is no option to turn this "feature" off.\n[UPDATE: They announced to fix this "intended bug" as soon as possible.]\n\n-Often, you don't see the whole table when you need some info from it, and that is when you need to choose the effects of some cards. For no reason at all, the whole table gets blurred when choosing effects. Annoying but no gamebreaker.\n\n-Two times now I died due to an Attack Phase or Block Phase not existing. I had enough untapped, non-summoning-sick creatures to kill the enemy but I had no Attack phase. Enemy plays Mass removal. gg","May 3","false","93.9"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","45","58","5","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperKamiGuru/recommended/316010/","SuperKamiGuru","Falcon4242","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperKamiGuru/","25 products in account","As someone who never played Magic before, I thought of this game as a good place to start to learn the game.  This game, unfortunately, is a mixed bag in its current state.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great, simplistic tutorial\n\n-Good atmosphere\n\n-Promise of expansions\n\n-Free to play\n\n-Campaign mode that helps you learn the pros/cons of the different colors\n\n-All cards are available through booster packs without seperate "premium" currancy\n\nCons:\n\n-Always online.  Any gold you earn offline will not count towards your total gold count.\n\n-Servers are very unreliable.  Thankfully, you can reconnect after a duel and still get your gold (usually), but this isn't a good launch for the game\n\n-Campaign can be unfair at times.  One match in particular has your opponent drain your library until you lose.  He  puts up defending cards that aren't even purchasable by the player.  You can win this match (and about 4-7 others) by pulling a single spell card from your pre-made, uneditable deck, but since you'll usually lose before you can draw it or it gets discarded, you'll have to restart a lot\n\n-Only the winner of online PvP duels gets gold from the match.  That means if you're on a dry streak, like me, you can't earn gold, which means you can't buy boosters, which means you can't upgrade your decks, which means you continue to lose.  And AI duels give you next to nothing as a reward (on Easy mode), so you might as well not bother unless you're testing a deck.\n\n-You can still buy gold with real money, so the game isn't as free to play as it makes you think.  Yes, the cards are still random when you buy boosters, but that doesn't mean someone with a lot of money to burn doesn't get an advantage in this game.\n\n-In fact, the only way you can earn gold by playing this game is by playing the campaign for a one-time bonus per mission, between 5-15 gold for AI battles, and 20 gold for ranked 1v1.  Want to play with friends?  Sorry, no gold.  Want to play random 2v2?  No gold either.\n\n-Also, if your opponent in an online duel concedes, you still aren't garunteed a win.  The player will be replaced by an AI, and if you lose then you still won't recieve your gold and be you'll be dropped in rank.  If my opponent gave up, why can't I recieve my rewards?\n\n-No communication available between teammates of Two Headed Giant mode (that I've found).  If you're a game developer for any card game and include a 2v2 mode, how can you neglect to include a communication system?  It's hard to figure out your teammate's strategy and attacking/blocking setup if you can't communicate through voice/text.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThis is a fun game to help you learn the ropes of Magic and play with friends but due to the lack of server consistancy and earning nothing from duels unless you win, it's hard to call this a suitable game for anyone but the curious, the grinders, and the hardcore Magic fan.","August 1, 2015","false","31.0"," 114 of 173 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","114","173","6","6"

A few single player campaign matchups still seem to be designed to frustrate. (The black sacrifice deck with no creatures with power more than 2 against a green deck built around getting counters by other creatures dying seems like a very odd choice to introduce new players to Magic.)

In truth I doubt any digital version of Magic will ever completely replicate all the nuances that people enjoy about the physical version\n\nHowever,\n\nIf you are like me and are looking for a fun way to get into (or back into) playing Magic with out the hassle and expense of cardboard magic then look no further.\n\nWhy?\nWhile the card selection is not 100% complete, it is certainly more than decent enough for many interesting deck building possibilities and the F2P business model for acquiring the cards seems very generous relative to other digital cardgames *cough*Hearthstone*cough*.\n\nThere are guides on the forums which can help newbies create viable starter decks out of the free cards that are initially granted after the first set of tutorials and the rest of the card selection can be unlocked at a fair pace for free by playing the AI and other players (I probably got the currency for half my boosters just by testing the various decks I've built against the AI). Still, don't expect to unlock all the cards in one day with out laying down some cash; though it can be done in about a month completely for free if you are an avid player.\n\nA few notes:\n\n-The game has had server issues, though they seem mostly cleared up at this point. I haven't run into any trouble playing in the past week or so.\n\n-Some people report bugs with certain hardware configurations, I've had none. Your mileage may vary.\n\n-Some complain about the lack of features, I agree. More features are always better however the developers have said they are committed to adding more cards/features and refining the interface in the future. Specifically, new cards are suppose to be added on the same time table as they are released for the physical card game, so that is cool.\n\n-Some people complain about a lack of in-game chat and other interface qualms, personally I can do without it during matches. Though an in-game lobby would be cool to discuss the current metagame and strats etc...\nIf the devs and Wizards tend to the investment they have in this piece of software then I am sure things like this are on the horizon as they would better flesh out the already enjoyable experience that this game offers.\n\n-Personally I wish there were more cosmetic things available to purchase in the store (avatar pictures, card table backdrops and stuff like that.) As of right now it is just booster packs and it seems like a waste to me to spend more than a few actual dollars on them as if you play regularly you will eventually unlock them all in pretty short order anyways. *shrug*","August 18, 2015","true","205.6"," 152 of 239 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","152","239","7","8"

Not from losing, which is what you'll spend most of your time doing when you're playing with the starter packs. You get 5 'coins' for a win against the AI, or 20 against a person. If that person spent enough real money to put together a fast, functional deck, you're not going to win, which means you've just wasted ten minutes of your life for nothing. Playing against the AI is about the only hope you have.\n\nYou get 5c for a win, and it costs 150c to buy a booster pack of 6 cards, most of which won't help you build whatever deck you're enjoying playing. So you have to win 30 games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards to get 6 new cards you don't want, and go on playing with the deck you already had. Each match takes 5-10 minutes, so assuming you won all thirty games in a row, you've been playing for about four hours or so... for -nothing-.\n\nOh, and you won't win all 30 games in a row. You're going to do a whole lot of conceding, restarting, and eye-rolling in the meanwhile. If you win 50% of your matches, you're at it for 8 hours. How's it feel to waste a whole day playing Magic with a starter deck, with tons of pauses and holdups, nothing but the same droning music, and the knowledge that your opponent just flat-out has a better setup than you do?\n\nThis is -terrible- game design. Absolutely insultingly terrible. Game designers, heads up: If you build an economy and then don't encourage me to participate in it, I'm not going to. MtG plays far faster in real life, and I can play with people I actually like, rather than the bank accounts of strangers. If you aren't going to build a system that ensures that losing players are eventually competitive, the losing players are going to stop playing entirely, like I am now.\n\nA word on story mode: The AI always has a better deck than you, the matches take forever to load, and the AI never misses a tactically advantageous move. Ever. This is boring, one-sided gameplay. To win, you have to get lucky on your draw, AND the AI has to be unlucky on theirs.\n\n0 / 5 stars.

Do not waste your time playing this for the two headed giant matches (which is really the only draw this game has) unless you like constantly pulling your hair out because your teammate decides what cards to play with lawn darts from 20 feet away from the screen.\n\n2. This is the buggiest M:TG game ever released by Stainless games.  I dont know how it made it past QA but that QA lead should have been fired... twice.  The game constantly bugs out during multiplayer matches or kicks you back to the multiplayer lobby or just plain permenently freezes while finding more players.\n\n3.  The "Free to Pay" style of the game doesnt make it any more fun to play, since of COURSE you are punished for playing anything other than 1v1 games by getting no gold grind or quest credit in multiplayer games.","January 26","false","167.2"," 45 of 60 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","45","60","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuam/recommended/316010/","cuam","cullam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuam/","51 products in account","This is without a doubt the worst game that I have ever played. Don't take such a statement lightly; this is no hyperbole.\n\nFirstly, the launch was outright pathetic. On release, roughly half of the people who wanted to play it could not due to two different crashing errors on startup. Additionally, there was major server instability. This had two major consequences:\nsince all progress requires a connection to their server, it was impossible to gain and keep gold.\ndespite 1, the game still checks for local data when it doesn't have a connection. Accidentally choosing to use local data (the consequences of which are not explained to the player) will overwrite all of your data on their server.So, within the first week many people could hardly play and/or were losing all of their gold/packs. People who didn't fit into this category couldn't even boot up the game successfully. Once the servers became more stable, the game was still riddled with hundreds (probably thousands) of bugs. Here's a short summary of a few:\nIf your opponent leaves while searching their library, the replacement AI never picks anything and you essentially softlock.\nSometimes opponents cast spells that they simply don't have the mana for. Whether this is hacking or a bug is sometimes hard to discern, but the devs don't seem worried about it either way.\nThere are a number of cards that straight up don't work in the way that they read. Under very different circumstances this would be more reasonable considering the complexity of MTG.\nTwo-Headed Giant, the whole reason I wanted to play this game, is all kinds of bugged out. More often than not it will just fail to work and you'll have to retry. Sometimes it will try to load five people into the game and kick your partner as a result. Sometimes you'll start the game and your partner will be on the opposing team. I'd say about 1 in every 30 connection attempts is a successful one.\nThere is a limit on gold earned per day, this is fine. What is not is that its reset seems to be dependent upon a way in which you talk with the server in an unrelated way. As in, it's fairly unpredictable. Sometimes I'll log on after a week of not playing and see that I've just hit the cap.\nThere are a lot of minor bugs that I'm either unaware of or I don't have time to explain in this already-lengthy review. Trust me, even these pile up whilst playing.Worst of all, the communication with the "community" has been completely awful. More than a week after release someone finally said a fix for the crash on startup error was in the works. This is the first we heard the devs even hint that they were WORKING on such a fix!  Fast forward a few days later, and the same person reported that the fix would take longer than expected. LOL!  Some other game-breaking bugs haven't even been acknowledged by the devs. As for all the other bugs, hell will likely freeze over before they even have the time or patience to care. Perhaps after two more years of development time this software could be passable for a game...\n\nBut hey, you're reading this in the future, right?  Let's say in this hypothetical world that will likely never exist, every bug and performance issue in the game has been resolved. Hooray!  From now on I'll be reviewing the game as it was "intended."\n\nOptionsUnlike other MTG games, there is no option to confirm that you have nothing to do at the end of someone's turn. This can be especially frustrating when you want to play an instant at the end of your opponent's turn, as you have a very small window to play it or stop the timer.\nThere is no option to manually tap lands for mana. Considering the AI for this is idiotic and will tap all of one color before tapping another, this is a much-needed option.\nControl mapping is absolutely awful. There are two main buttons in the game, one for Continue/Skip Attacking/etc. and one for Timer/Attack with All/etc. You can only change the hotkey for the Continue and Timer functions of these buttons. The other functions remain the default selection no matter what.Graphics + VolumeThe graphics quality in this game is fairly horrendous, even for a simple card game. The quality settings don't seem to do anything, as on Ultra settings I still see a lot of jagged lines. The game performs equally slowly in all manner of settings.\nThe resolution settings are pretty damn horrendous. There's a tiny number of different resolutions, and to run on my HDMI TV I had to manually change the resolution in the config.ini file. When I ran this resolution in fullscreen, my game would consistently crash. Additionally, there is no windowed borderless option for the game, I had to install a third-party program that would give this function.\nThe cinematics are laughably bad. I'm actually counting this as a positive thing, because at least this is something you can laugh at.\nSome sounds in the game aren't affected by the volume parameters you set. For example, I still hear intro music at full volume (LOUD) until it loads the settings and fades away. The volume for the cinematics is so quiet that you're basically watching a silent movie.Quests + F2PThe quests for gold in the game are all extremely lazy. Most are archetypal quests, where you have to win x games with a deck of two varying colors. The catch is that you can't build these decks yourself, they must be built by the deck wizard. The deck wizard makes some pretty bad decisions, like putting every single type of special land you have into your deck for no reason whatsoever.\nTwo Headed Giant, one of the most exciting things about this game, doesn't give any gold. 2v2s generally take longer than 1v1s and certainly take longer than 1vAIs, so it would be bad even if it gave equivalent gold. Essentially, if you want your card pool to progress you can't have fun.\nOne nice thing (probably out of laziness) is that you can't get extra cards in packs. That is to say, once you have 4 commons, you'll never see that card in a pack. This makes it so that there's a certain number of packs you need and you'll absolutely have all the cards. This is refreshingly deterministic for such an awful game.Card RestrictionsRather than normal MTG where you can have 4 of any card, there are restrictions placed based on the rarity of the card. This is good for F2P players, but bad overall: it's impossible to build decks around rare cards.\nThe set is very small and has a lot of holes: counterspells, draw and removal in some colors.\nCard Collection MenuWhile the menus in the entire game are pretty bad, the card collection menu is where it's most frustrating. There's no way to search for keywords, so you have to manually filter through cards to do so. The act of putting cards into your deck is tedious and annoying, there's no decklist, you can only put any search parameters if you're building a deck, etc etc.\n\nUI+GameplayBeing able to stop the timer and do things in various phases is an extremely important part of MTG. Unfortunately this is stupidly difficult in this game. The actual window of time you have to pause the phase is unchanging, whereas various animations (even animations for which phase of the game you're in) will bleed into that window.\nIn games with other human players, whenever a player concedes they're replaced with the AI.\nYou can stop the timer indefinitely to BM your opponent.\nGameplay is just...not smooth. Once you've clicked on a card, you have to play it. You can get stuck looking at cards during the timer, etc.\nThey evidently didn't expect people to have more than eight types of things in play, because things overlap and look disgusting.Just...DON'T PAY MONEY FOR THIS GAME.","August 23, 2015","false","64.6"," 92 of 140 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","92","140","9","3"

Wizards of the Coast defined the genre, and none of their competitors, in video games or paper, have managed to match the depth of their game. Just look at their biggest competition, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Hearthstone. All extremely simplified versions of the TCG genre.\n\nI can at least admit that this is a good intruduction to new players. Even a veteran like me is forced through a tutorial that holds your hand every step of the way, but like all of the "Duels" franchise, there's only so much to hold your attention on the other side, and it's severely lacking.\n\nIf this were a franchise that were slowly expanded upon over the years, it might actually be amazing by now, but every year something nice from the previous version is missing. 2014 had 2hg and sealed matches, but otherwise you only had a few premade decks. 2015 let you build your own decks, but got rid of 2hg and sealed.\n\nWith Magic: Duels, WotC told us they had listened. They brought back 2hg, and were going to make all the new cards available, with new boosters being available every new physical set, but why even bring back 2hg when you completely remove all ability to communicate or even see the name of who you're playing, apart from the first 3 seconds of a match. You no longer have any idea if your opponent rage/quit and you're playing the AI. This means you can't play with your friends, or make friends in the game.\n\nI feel WotC is afraid that if they made a game on par with other modern f2p games, they would lose paper customers, and I'm sure MTGO is too ancient to be able to move all those customers and all the cards they bought into a modern game. It reminds me of the way Microsoft has treated PC gaming for the sake of Xbox. Make the experience as painful as possible, and they'll buy your hardware.\n\nWell, Wizards, you got me, I still buy your "hardware", but all your software is garbage.","July 30, 2015","false","93.8"," 67 of 98 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","67","98","3","0"

I feel like I'm playing the good Magic card game. I hope we will have some more cards to collect, and I hope we will have some new mode (maybe a 3v3 emperor style ?).\n\nBut then the problems appear.\n\nFirst, I have 10 friends trying to play this. Only 3 can play it, since all the others have the game crashing with "unknow error" when they launch it. And, of course, they can do nothing about it (and yet we have no answer from the developpers). I wanted so hard to go play 2v2 with them, but since we're only 3...\n\nSo we tried to play with strangers. And the real magic appears ! The matchmaking is so bad, probably due to servers bugs. I mean, first you have to invit a friend to be part of your team. It loads, it's not instant, so you wait. Then you try to find some strangers to fight against, and 3 out of 4 times it bugs. And when it bugs, you have to reinvit your friend, and wait again. When you finaly reach the point of playing with strangers, one of them or one of us crashes, so you end up playing with or against a bot. Boring.\n\nStill, the 1v1 is good. And even it's free to play, you can have a lot of cards by weeks. These are the only good points right now.","August 10, 2015","false","201.2"," 54 of 78 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","54","78","2","2"

However, there was some networking issue when I tried matchmaking, and so I restarted the game to try to fix it. It said there was desync between my local game and the cloud when the game started, and so I allowed the game to sync with the cloud. Basically, it took one of my booster packs I opened, and did not refund me the 150 gold I spent on it. Of course, it was the booster pack that had my Outland Colossus in it.\n\nGAME RUINED FOR ME.

Story Mode is fair since AI uses real libraries with random hands unlike it is in Magic 2014, for example. Unfortunately, there are poorly designed decks like the one in infamous Liliana's campaign. As for common duels, progress with collecting cards is extremely slow and too luck-based if you don't buy gold for real money. If you play with AI, the choice of difficulty doesn't affect your opponent's library, so you might easily win on Hard but encounter an opponent with four mythic cards on Medium when you don't own any for your deck. There are archetype decks which are much easier to build out of the starter set than the others, but it quickly becomes boring to farm in-game gold with the same strategy. In personal quests, you often get tasks like winning 4 games with a weak deck and winning 2 games with a decent one, and both have the same award. Community quests that last for several days are usually completed within first 24 hours and then just occupy the slot uselessly. Sometimes there is an impossible goal to achieve, and once there was a quest that didn't work at all, having 0 in its counter for the whole time being. Developers just didn't give anything to care about it. Also, there is no in-game chat (even in two-headed giant games), no any awards for two-headed giant victories, and network games just get stuck from time to time.\n\nI highly recommend playing real MtG and maybe spend some free time in Magic 2014 to have some practice.

MTG by itself still has a soft spot in my heart and in a way this game works better than the previous clients done by WotC. Just the fact that we're now allowed to make our own decks is big improvement. But has the gameplay itself improved?\n\nUnfortunately no. Game is riddled with bugs. I've had my combat phase completely skipped a few times and sometimes I am not allowed to activate abilities or stop the clock even though I normally could.\n\nAnother thing is the connection issues. Searching for a game is tedious because it seems that if either player disconnects (which seems to happen way too often) the matchmaking will just stop. Who thought this was a good idea? If there's a disconnect, just reset the matchmaking queue and let the player wait for an actual match, no one wants to press that find opponent button all the time after queue failing.\n\nTechnical issues aside, let's get to the game design. User interface is a joke! Why is the stop timer, the most important button in the game, in the lower right corner when I need to keep an eye on the centre of the game? Furthermore, if you game designers put the important UI buttons in a bad place, at least have the decency to force the steam notifications to top right for example... In the genral the UI is pretty bad (menus etc) but the actual action buttons are horrible. Keybindings are necessary in this game so thank goodness for those.\n\nWhy do I have to finish a game when my opponent leaves? Frustrating and time consuming, tedious is the key word here. And why is the matchmaking so horrible in general? I get matchmade with lvl 9 accounts when I'm 1. Also aside the matchmaking, the business model is off the records pay to win unless you are really lucky with your booster drops.

It's the same engine with a few tweaks over and over again.\n* Same flawed RNG which stacks same cards together (whether lands or multiple copies of one card)\n* Stupid automatic land tapping (yeah, yeah, you can press that button, wait, which is it? to manually alter it, but com'on, so many years and they can't tackle that)\n* 2HG is back, but there is no CHAT..\n* The game will occasionally crash (almost two months after a release, forums are filled with reports)\n* Will be not surprised if this game has the same bug with disappearing steam cloud saves as with all games in the series (so i have disabled steam cloud for this game right away).\n\nI'm still playing through campaign to find out all the Origins story line and trying to entertain myself by completing few achievements. Have built one deck, but the pool of cards seems limited. Will probably try opening few boosters with the coins i have earned in the campaign (not spending any real money on this). So, after the campaign it is only MP. MP is fun occasionally (with some sort of communication), but i prefer playing offline against AI, completing lenghty campaign with some deck and seeing how it compares to other decks. With only MP i will uninstall it soon.\n\nMissing 2012-2014 versions, with lots of decks to unlock, huge campaigns, some sort of a unique game mode.\n\nP.S. latest patch introduced automatic skipping of phases when you have no creature or sorcery to play. Makes it pain in the ♥♥♥ to play with instants and some intricate abilities as you have to constantly hit pause all the time. They say this should speed up games. Yeah, at the cost of losing battles because of that.","September 6, 2015","false","146.0"," 51 of 77 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","51","77","0","1"

I played through the tutorial and the first Origin story, which is required to unlock the game's other modes, and to accumulate in-game currency.  Then I was prompted to make my own deck by opening some boosters including a few more from the tutorial money.  I included my cool new rares and beat up an Easy AI, then took a break.\n\nWhen I reopened the game a few hours later, I got a Steam cloud sync error and then somehow an entire booster pack of cards was removed from my collection.

Why are you failing SO miserably at implementing something SO simple? You added 2 headed giant BUT REMOVED CHAT? Why is there no android version? The game was CLEARLY designed for touch screens. I LOVE Magic the Gathering, and other card games like it. This.... Isn't good. It's here for the sole purpose of collecting your money. Go to Wizards of the Coast's Website, and pay 10 dollars to actually play Magic the Gathering. This is for children who want to look at pretty pictures on cards. Not for anyone who wants to play magic, and CERTAINLY not for anyone who wants to play with their friends.\nHOW did you possibly make it more clumsy than 2015?\nGame informer says it is the best implementation of Duels yet.....

Unfortunatly, it fails to deliver in many aspects that I feel like it could have easily fixed\n+ Is free (technically)\n+ brought 2 headed giant back\n+ Keeps the fun of deckbuilding and custimization\n+ optional tutorials for newer players that are not forced on older players\n+Story mode that ACTUALLY goes into the lore of magic (for once)\n+ FINALLY allows you to use planeswalkers card types\n\n-Can be pay 2 win as people who buy boosters will probably have more cards and be able to win more (thus getting more gold and getting MORE cards)\n-for the momment, very limited card pool to chose from, allowing very limited style (and limited power) decks\n- a lot of disconnect issues, although hopefully these will be fixed soon\n- if not paying for packs, getting gold to get them can be VERY grindy, and some of the quests dont even work to give you your gold\n-types of cards avaiable basically force you into differn't archetypes based on your colors ( if your black green, based on the avaibale cards, its probably going to have to be G/B elves for example)\n- Can be diffcult to find opponenets in multiplayer, particularly for 2 headed giant.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I have with the game however is that in the story mode it specifcally shows you differn't cards that certain characters will you against you (such as Alhemmerat using fog banks to protect himself to use mill cards on you) However can you use some of these cards to help amplify your decks or give you differn't styles of decks? Nope, in fact the cards are nowhere to be seen, which makes about as much since to me as this game has in general sometimes. Why bother programming the cards to use for a SINGLE campaign level, to then never be touched again, and then just decide to not let players use them? Want to use jace's mill deck or cards? Or how about the eldrazi cards that are used in Nissa's levels? Whelp sorry, even though we programmed them and their here, you cant have them.\n\nThe only reason I can think the above statement is the case is if wizards is saving those cards for future expansions and wants more $$$, which honsetly with how this game is, I could see being the case. Although this game is fun, and is technically free, I wish wizards would just go back to the design team for M14 and use that, becouse THAT was a great game, and had tons of fun features and decks to choose from compared to this. Even though this is getting a negative review for many reasons though, I will say that its still something to try out with a friend or maybe even just to play the campaign to learn a little bit of the lore of magic or something.","August 2, 2015","false","33.8"," 98 of 161 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","98","161","2","5"

For now though, I suggest skipping this game and picking up one of the other magic games on steam despite this one being free.\n\nPros:\n-Great Deckbuilding! It is really awesome and you can build a deck from scratch with whatever cards you acquire!\n-Lots of new cards not in the previous games, but also some returning ones that I couldn't live without.\n-Two headed giant is a lot of fun to play. I love the teamwork based strategies that you need to use.\n-It's still magic. And magic is... well... magical. Play it if you haven't before.\n\nCons:\n-Matchmaking/server issues. This is a gamebreaker right here for me. The servers are extremely unreliable, which I wouldn't even mind if I could play the campaign while they were down! But you can't. That's right it blocks your progress and gold you made in the campaign if you can't connect to their servers. So that Liliana duel you've spent ten hours on trying to beat and then finally beat it, might just count for nothing if you randomly get disconnected from their servers. *Pro TIp* you will.\n- Extremely small amount of gold earned outside of the campaign. Yeah I get that this game is F2P and they need to make their money somehow, but at least let us earn gold in two headed giant, and make the gold gained based on how long your duel takes. Because getting 20 gold for both an hour long duel and a 5 minute duel seems a little unbalanced.\n-No chat function. At all. Like seriously. Where is it? How am I supposed to tell my scrub-lord teammates not to sacrifice all of our creatures now. Or even applaud them and give them super high fives when they do something so awesome that helps us win the game? It's definitely not as fun without chat. Magic is a social game... why take out the social aspect of it?!\n-UI. The UI is okay but needs to be polished up a lot. I keep seeing cards upside down, damage and defense numbers sideways and floating off the card so I can't see them, and even a couple of errors in the game where cards do not do what they're supposed to do.\n-Damage animations. Half the time I spend dueling people online is spent waiting for them to finish watching the damage animations. Please disable them for online play.\n-Not necessarily a con but being able to customize your playing field with different backgrounds would be very nice and add some much needed variety into the playing field.\n\nSummary: How long have they been making magic video games now? 4 years? I'm suprised they haven't figured out how to improve on their last games yet. It almost feels like they went backwards with this one. If they fix the little bugs and server issues this game will be very fun for a long time. It would be really great to see them continue updates for this and always be adding new cards/game modes/ etc. My final verdict on this game is to play it if you've never played magic before because it's free, and you can't really go wrong with a free game if you're just trying it out. But if you have played magic before and you're a fan of the series, stick to one of the old ones.","August 2, 2015","false","45.2"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","34","49","2","1"

Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game.\n\nAt its core Magic the Gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the Coast seems to have forgotten this. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS YOU CANT EARN GOLD, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a DAILY CAP, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to Play for Free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards. With a daily cap I'm not sure why you can't earn gold in 2HG mode or even Free4all with buddies. YOU CANT EVEN LOBBY UP WITH FRIENDS.\n\nMagic Origins wants to compete with Hearthstone, show it who rules the roost of TCGs. Too bad it can't without an overhaul of the system. If you play magic on Steam, you can't play your account on IOS, PS, or XBOX. Meaning you will have to START ALL OVER ON EACH PLATFORM. Another month or two of grind, or cold hard cash. This could be a greed driven decision by wizards, or ineptitude, either way it's bad. Plus Magic is BUGGY, broken cards, broken mechanics, broken leaderboards, and connectivity issues.\n\nMagic for some reason seems to hate letting you build decks with any kind of consistancy, limiting the number of rares you can own to 2-3 and ultra rares to 1. With a total of 256 cards you would assume to see the same cards u see dropping for the paper release. This is not the case. You're stuck with a ton of bad filler cards from past years and then rounded out by a few of the actual origins cards. I hope this isn't the case for upcoming expansions.\n\nIn my opinion Wizards is just plain afraid to make a decent digital magic game. Afraid that if they do it will hinder the sales of its real life counterpart. To that I say, warning Wizards. Magic the Gathering is the OG of TCGs, but unless the OG adapts to the present, the young bucks like Hearthstone will bury it. Have some confidence in the franchise and produce a digital game you can be proud of.\n\nBelieve it or not I'm a huge fan of MTG, and can only hope that Wizards will update this game. Solving the issues addressed here and adding content like Drafts, Sealed pools, Archenemy, Planes Chase, and Commander/EDH. Most importantly the ability to make a lobby and play with friends. WITHOUT FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH, MAGIC CARDS ARE JUST PRETTY PICTURES.","July 29, 2015","false","83.0"," 154 of 268 people (57%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","57","154","268","12","3"

ANY POSITIVE EXPECTATIONS WILL BE DESTROYED.  It is clear that the developers didn't do any testing at all, since every aspect of the game is buggy and poorly-designed.\n\nI would describe this as less of a game and more of a prison.  Installing it is slightly confusing, as it's listed under "Demos" rather than "Games".  However, it's only once you get into the game that you realize just how much the developers, Stainless Games, hate you, and you realize how low their opinion of you must be.\n\nFirst, there's the tutorial, which is required before you play a single game.  Even if multiplayer weren't locked, it would still be required, as it rewards gold to get more cards.  So, you play through the five missions of the five planeswalkers.  These missions range from easy to impossible, entirely depending on your opening hand.  You have no control over your deck and can't even see what cards are in it, so you just have to mulligan until you get a start that beats your opponent.  This basically boils down to luck:  If the computer gets a good hand and you get a bad one, you have no way of turning that around.  There is very little room for correct or savvy play, rather you just grind until you get a better opener, get an unsatisfying win, and collect your gold.  A couple of the missions are kind of fun, but overall it feels like a chore that you have to take care of before you can play the game.\n\nActually, I lied.  VERY first, you hear the opening music at max volume, then click Play! and hear a resounding BOOM, again at max volume, no matter what your volume settings are in the game.  A minor but all-too-telling error.\n\nNow that you have some cards, you can build a deck.  So, let's say you're a total newb and you use the Deck Wizard, which gives you a range of archetypes to try.  You pick a feisty, red-white aggro deck, planning to chip away at your opponent a little at a time with your early creatures, burning a path for them with red spells.  Unfortunately, the Deck Wizard doesn't understand that you want your "All-Out Assault! " theme deck to be mostly made of things you can play with less than 3 mana, so when it chooses what cards you can pick between (you get 5 options at a time), it will most likely be full of 4-drops.  Furthermore, even if you do get low-drops, it's entirely possible that they will require a heavy commitment to the wrong color, e.g., you're building a mostly-red deck and the options are all cards with WW in the casting cost.  Finally, when it comes to adding mana to the deck, you have no control over what lands are added, and the game always adds the same number of lands, in the same format.  In this example, 18 Mountains/Plains (appropriately portioned), 2 dual lands that don't come into play tapped, 4 guildgates that do come into play tapped.  So, 24 lands, 4 of which come into play tapped, into every deck.  This is a serious hindrance to an aggressive deck that wants to draw maybe 3-4 lands tops for the whole game.  To avoid this, you can build your own deck, but I'll get into that later.\n\nSo you have a deck now, and you're ready to face an opponent.  You have two choices:  play against humans, or play against the AI.  Both of these guarantee gold when you win, with humans giving slightly more gold than a Hard AI.  So you decide to pit yourself against another real opponent.  You click the button, choose your deck, and hop into the queue.  But, your connection drops and you're back at the main screen.  "The session was full", says an error.  So you try again.  No dice, same error.  Well, so the game was just released, it's a little buggy, alright.  You try again, this time it says "The server timed out".  You keep trying, and on the fourth or fifth try, you manage to find a real opponent.  Great!  Time to play some magic.\n\nYou draw your opening seven, you're missing one of your colors but hey, no problem!  You get a free redraw of seven cards (which I like)!  That hand works out and you're ready to lay the beatdown.  You play your 1-drop.  Your opponent plays a land.  You play your two-drop and SWING!  Your opponent loses a life, they play their land and a 2-drop, go.  You burn the two-drop out of the way, hit face again, and so on.  After a couple more burn spells, your opponent's out of real plays, and you still have a couple cards in hand, so they concede.  Woohoo! you've won your first game of Magic Duels Origins!  NOT SO FAST.  "PlayerX has been replaced by the AI", the game tells you.\n\nEven if your opponent concedes, you still don't win.  Again, it's all-too-telling.\n\nOkay, well, by now you've gotten your toes wet, so you're ready to dive in, build your own deck, and start cranking out that sweet, sweet gold.  You check your Daily Quests, which you know exist because they're presented to you on log-in.  You have two "Archetypal" quests:  "Win 2 duels with a RW or GW archetype deck", and "Win 4 duels with a UB or UW archetype deck".  They both reward 40 gold.  Well, 2>4, and they both reward the same amount of gold, so... time to make a rushy white-blue aggro deck with lots of fliers.  It goes well enough, you don't have that much beat-down but you also have some bigger threats for when the game goes long.  You don't have cheap countermagic, but all-in-all that's probably for the best.\n\nSo you slog through the matchmaking process and find yourself a match.  You beat your opponent (woohoo! +20 gold!) but your quest doesn't update.  Why not?  Well, it doesn't clarify in-game, but when you go to the reddit you find out that "archetype deck" means "Deck Wizard deck".  So basically every day, you're required to play with what is almost certainly a worse version of a deck you could create.  Since it's a requirement in order to progress, this means that you waste no less than half an hour of play-time every day throwing together an archetype deck that is as aggressive as possible and then zerging down the AI, because you're never going to win a game if you play that deck against other people, and it'll take your ranking down if you lose.\n\nI should spend a few words on the ranking system.  Here's how it works:  When you win a game, you go up a rank; when you lose a game, you go down a rank.  Your rank caps at 40, no matter how good you are.  Rank barely matters anyway, because you're liable to face anyone within 10-15 ranks of you anyway.\n\nWhatever.  You keep playing, because you're optimistic that, once you get more cards, you'll actually be able to build some pretty fun, pretty powerful decks.  Six cards at a time, you're completing your collection.  (I do like the way this is handled, by the way:  Once you have the maximum playable number of a given card, you can no longer receive that card in a booster.  This means that if you play long enough you are guaranteed to have a complete collection.)  You've been at it for a few hours, rising in rank, when suddenly you finish a game and don't receive any gold for it!  This is because you've hit your gold cap for the day.  You can no longer earn any gold, except from daily quests.\n\nThat pretty well puts a damper on your ladder aspirations.  If you're not earning anything by doing it, what's the point?  If you rise in rank you'll theoretically be facing harder opponents, making winning more difficult, so you're shooting yourself in the foot a little bit by continuing to ladder.\n\nIt's as if the game is saying, "Stop playing me!  Go away, do something else with your time!"  Fine.  You decide to play some funsies 2v2's with your buddy.\n\nBy the way, it's a little strange that playing vs. the AI earns you gold while playing with real players, in 2v2, does not.  After all, the games aren't any shorter or easier than playing 1v1, certainly not shorter or easier than 1v1'ing AI.  It certainly makes me want to play the game less, since 2HG is the funnest game mode.","August 23, 2015","false","49.7"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","30","46","0","6"

If you're curious as to why this game has such a low rating, I can boil it down for you pretty quick here. It's not a bad game overall - in fact it's essentially the same as every other year - but Wizards has made two pretty aggravating mistakes.\n\n1. This is an online-only game, and the online servers are not very functional. They work *much* better now, but at launch there was simply no playing this.\n\n2. The story mode (which was the main draw for many players, as it fleshes out some lore elements that have been mainly untouched for a couple of years) is pretty awful. You're given a pre-built deck, to fight another pre-built deck, and you do this twenty five times. All "fifty" decks involved (most are variants on eachother) are just bad decks and games routinely run into the 30-45 turn mark, sometimes taking almost an hour apiece to wrap up. Wizards tries to spruce it up by adding matches with a twist (alternate win conditions, the semblance of fighting multiple enemies, even one where you're supposed to lose, which was very frustrating to find out as a player who knows how to track a game and hit "restart" a few turns in advance when a loss is imminent) but I have to stress the fact that the pre-built matchups are exhausting and poorly balanced, so you'll be sitting through a headache.\n\nThe rest of the game is fine, it's serviceable as a quick MTG fix but if you're here specifically for the stories, just read some forum materials and the relevant Uncharted Realms content. Take it from a several year Magic player, that's going to be a better way to get the story.","August 4, 2015","true","10.0"," 52 of 87 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","52","87","4","0"

I'll start with what works well.  And by that, the entirety of it is the fact that my friend 300 miles away can play Magic with me.  That's great.  Beyond that, there are entirely too many issues to make this game worthwhile.\n\nFirstly, the gameplay is solid on the surface, but suffers when complex combos come into play.  For starters, if I play something that costs one swamp and we'll say one colorless, it will automatically tap two swamps, prohibiting me from using that second swamp for another card.  As well, the instant abilities (and by this I mean activated abilities on creactures or enchantments), only sort of work.  I played a game recently where I attempted to use the Nantuko Husk's acitvated ability to avoid losing it, and it was akin to swinging my arms around and hoping something stuck.  These are just a couple of examples of how the rules have been poorly translated to interactivity.\n\nThat being said, if you are hard up for some Magic, this may do the trick.  But I want you to know, going into it, that in addition to the above, the matchmaking is subpar at best, and oftentimes, if you and a friend try to play a match, it will kick one of you and insert an AI opponent.  This game does the trick, only in the sense, that you and someone else can play Magic.  That being said, it's not necessarily, or even often, an enjoyable experience.  I hope that there are significant improvements to matchmaking and simple instant-level gameplay (and by this I include activated abilities) in a very-soon-to-come update.\n\nI want this game to be a good one.  I simply cannot in good concsious say it already is.","September 11, 2015","false","12.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","2"

Unfortunately Magic Duels takes the opposite approach. You need to actively pause a timer in order to take an "instant" action. You also have to wait for the timer, you can't fast forward. This decision made playing games feel too long.\n\nIf you play an hour and that doesn't bother you, then this might be a good game for you. You can fairly easily earn gold to buy packs and you can play against humans or AI.\n\nJust because I personally don't like the interface doesn't mean it is a bad game.

Just because I love Mtg and I had hoped that it would bring me some pleasure.\n\nWRONG.\n\nThis game was basically made by sadistic developers, who decided "hey, you know what? Giving players a fair challenge would be way too easy. Let's make them suffer!". Basically every match in that so-called "campaign mode" is a pure hellish experience, that makes you want to strangle nearest person. Or a cat. It doesn't make a difference, really. Just strangle.\n\nBasic concept of a game is "to be fun".\n\nWRONG AGAIN.\n\nThe "fun" aspect was cut out by really unballanced decks. Of course that you HAVE TO PLAY with PREMADE decks in campaign with no sideboard option (devs, ya heard about sideboards?) and no way of checking what was added to your deck in any way but restarting the next duel - which you obviously will, since it takes at least 10 tries to draw a hand that would in some suprising way be a good hand against a sadistic I-am-really-prepared-for-only-your-deck deck. On top of that, the name, "sadistic I-am-really-prepared-for-only-your-deck deck", is not a coincidence. Those soon-to-be-devouring-you premade decks of opponents are made only to frustrate player, prepared to counter your EVERY move. Not the other way around, which would be good for new players.\n\nSpeaking of newbies getting into MTG: Don't, I repeat, DO NOT download this game. It will make you hate this beautiful game. Besides few matches in campaign that teach you basics, you will get thrown into the pit of hatred, which is stirred again and again, causing you to raise your eyebrows and asking: "how the hell could anyone enjoy this?". Let me tell you, why: There are people who like to eat spiders and walk on shattered glass. This happens.\n\nBut it is nnothing compared to this "game". I wasn't even able to play online, but from what I've been told by not majority, but EVERYONE who played it - it is not worth it. Sure, you can play with your OWN decks, but it takes around an hour for a match and most times, if you know how to play MTG, you will soon be facing a bot who finishes the match for your opponent, who leaves furiously because of loosing. Fun.\n\nTo summarize: Magic Duels is NOT a free game. You pay with your sanity and, if you want to, your money. I may be masochistic enough to finish the campaign just to be sure that this "game" is not worth downloading. To be fair, I did not finish the game because of a crash (that's right, previous hellish encounters had nothing to do with that), when I had around 30 health, 8 creatures and ready-to-die opponent (I think it was 2nd clash in last deck's campaign). I highly doubt that last 3 matches, should I win, would miraculously enchant me to the point where I'd suddenly like this satans' spawn of a game.\n\nAnd yes - this review is quite angry, because, to be honest, MD gave me nothing but pain, suffering, anger and tears rather than joy and fun. Everything that I never found playing MTG in real life.","August 5, 2015","false","10.0"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","22","33","2","0"

And Magic is an awesome trading card game!\n- Its's free!\nSooo.. there is no reason why you shoudn't download this game and try it out. :)\n\nHowever, I can save you the time. :/\nCons:\n- The Cards you start with are crap. Surprise surprise. But there are even worse than you would expect. If you start playing Magic in real-life, you usually start with a starter-deck for ~10€, so you have sth. that is playable. Here, you have just a bunch of random cards, and almost no good ones. You simply won't be able to get a good deck together the first week you play this game (3h+ a day).\n- The whole content seems not be able to support some decent possible deck, since it's rather common (30% of the matches) that the AI (which has access to all cards) does not play a creature before the 5th turn.\n- Surrendering Players get AI'd, so you can still lose the match or you don't feel to have won a match against a human. So the key element (PvP) is obsolete since the AI-matches give you almost the same amount of gold (15 vs. 20) while beeing so much easier.\n\nConclusion: After playing a longer time, and grinding myself to death (due to the 6-Cards-Booster this takes forever) I have no good deck, almost no progress and no fun.\nBut thats just my opinion.\nThere are some reasons however, that are not so easily to dismiss.\n\nBugs\n(there are tons of them reportet, but I will only tell about those I had to notice.\n\n- Finish a quest and getting no reward.\n- An opponent managed to play 2 Lands in his first turn (without card-effects)\n- Card-effects that are bugged (rarely, but this is a no-go)\n- Sometimes priorities and the stack won't work like they should according to the rules (Effects are resolving at the wrong time, not always top to down)\n\nWell.. its like an early-access-game. Little content, bugs, pay to win, no, pay to have fun and I will not pay nearly as much for a virtuel card as I would for a real (6-cards-booster for 1,70€ vs. 10-cards-booster for 3€) in a game that isn't even working properly.\n\nDo not support this game.","August 20, 2015","false","32.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matsuringo/recommended/316010/","matsuringo","Matsuringo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matsuringo/","133 products in account","Absolutely unacceptable and irredeemable.\n\nOne would hope Stainless Steel/WotC learned a little bit about last year's Duels fiasco, but it seems they have a learning disorder. Please note that at this time, MTG Duels has many connectivity and technical issues; I am not even going to take those into account, as that is typical of a launch, plus I didn't experience much of it myself.\n\nThis game's biggest sin by far here is greed. For now, let's put aside the whole gold cap/microtransaction bit and focus solely on one thing: the god damn cards. They're all HORRIBLE. They refused to use the entire Origins set and instead opted for the most unplayable garbage filler cards. One can only assume this is so people will continue to play paper MTG or MTGO, however this does not make for a fun game. They cannot afford to half ♥♥♥ this when Hearthstone has such a firm grasp on the online TCG market; they really need to step up and be a viable competitor and axing out all the good cards from your set does not make a good game. I can honestly see this being a strategy in order to make their first expansion addition sell better; they simply make the base set ♥♥♥♥, make the expansion amazing and bam, people want to buy the cards NOW to get something decent. I wouldn't even mind if some of the cards were decently playable, but they're just not. You get ONE blue counterspell that costs FOUR mana, two black kill spells that both cost FIVE mana, a white exile that costs FIVE mana, red burn spells worse than SHOCK and absolutely no good green beasts worth mentioning.\n\nLet's move on to the gold system and the rest of the game. There's a daily gold cap, which I understand quite frankly. Unlike Hearthstone, there are no excess cards here. You just get cards until you have them all, so packs need to be more limited by that nature. However what isn't fine is pretty much every facet of multiplayer. There is no chat with opponents, no lobbies with friends (something previous DotP had), and no gold to be made playing with said friends. Gold acquisition falls squarely on random matches against online players you'll never interact with, a one time run of the story, and fighting hard level AI. This makes earning gold time consuming and unfun, a clear push towards purchasing and another check mark on the greed list.\n\nEven as a single player game, this game fails. The story mode has absolutely nothing on nearly every other DotP entry in terms of variety and length. Their existence is there just to pad out more time in order to frustrate you into buying gold. The single player opponents have well put together decks that you simply cannot reliably match with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ card pool. They will win and you will be forced to draw an absolutely perfect scenario in order to win. This makes victory less about skill and more about pure luck, which is a horrible thing to do to MTG players.\n\nI can't think of a single positive thing to say about this game. The music sucks, the font is harder to read, the buttons in combat are placed poorly, there are no special modes (archenemy, plane chase, etc), playing with your friends doesn't allow you to progress, the cards suck, the AI has unfair advantage, WotC is extremely transparent about wanting my money and despite taking longer to launch on PC, the client still has issues.\n\nWotC needs to get in touch with reality before seriously attempting to step into the digital TCG realm.","July 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 36 of 59 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","36","59","3","1"

Not all the bugs are fixed. Card pool is very diverse and the meta is great. We need some big fixes but other than that the game is fantastic.\n\nI don't usually do reviews. But this one deserves one as it is F2P and the tweens have come out in numbers because we have had a few days of connection problems. Other problems from the manchild fanbase amount to the game being too hard, grinding being too hard, and all kinds of other ridiculous things among a few valid concerns. Some problems do exist but they are pretty minor, and I will get to them later.\n\nPersonally, I have grinded only a bit and already am steadily winning matches and easily unlocking many good cards. I think the key here is this game is complex. You need to be able to build decks correctly and if you can't well you are going to have to learn. This isn't Hearthstone, so if you prefer a much easier and less complex game there is always that for you.\n\nAnother thing is the constant moaning about unlocking cards through gold. The game is FREE. Once they sort out community challenges and patch a couple of bugs the game will be very smooth. The so-called veterans complaining this isn't as complex as "normal" Magic are full of it. This game has all you need for a Magic veteran no longer interested in paper. I don't have time for paper, have little in common with those kinds of people generally, and prefer digital by a long shot. This is the only Magic game I will ever need. Now onto the game....\n\nTo start with, this is easily the best and most functional game Stainless has ever made. Period. I haven't run into too many major bugs that affect the card play and nor do I have any connection issues anymore. My hours attest to this. I am sure there are a few more problems I have not spotted, but so far the game isn't even CLOSE to the disaster of connection issues that 2013 was. 2014 was still a buggy mess at times and had a very terrible deck tier framework to boot.\n\nThe deckbuilder in Origins is great, if a little streamlined and lacking some options people might want. You can duplicate decks, make any deck you want fairly easily, and you can also narrow down your searches of the card pool with options to parse. It's not perfect but what is there works very well. You can also name your decks and select an avatar and background for each, which is a nice added touch. I do wish we could see the deck names people make for their builds in the versus screen.\n\nThe modes they do have in the game are pretty much normal for a Magic game. I have no problems here. (I refused to buy 15 on account of 2HG missing). The campaign is fun and short like other years, and should prime newcomers to the game quite easily. I enjoyed the short stories of the planewalkers and actually had hoped there were about ten matches for each character. A bit of a letdown there, but only because it was fairly well done if a little low budget. Make sure you select a good round of cards to begin the game or it could end up being pretty tough in some matches.\n\n1v1 and 2HG are there for you and friends to play, although you do not earn gold with friends as of this review. 2HG is finally back and it's not perfect.... but it's friggin' back!. I was mainly a 2HG player in 2014 and down because I hated 1v1 with scripted decks, but now we have 2HG again and it's pretty great. Chat and some connection issues need to be ironed out, but I can't be mad that they put back in the mode we all protested for.\n\nAnyway, the most important part of the game is obviously the cards and the balance of the cards. And this is where the game shines. To start with the look of the cards is fantastic, eclipsing by a great deal any other card game on the market. Hearthstone looks like a child's game compared to the beauty of Magic and its artwork and card layout. Period. Not even arguable. This year looks the best out of all of them. You can read all the information you need about any card in the deckbuilder and in the game. A welcome improvement from 14. The board itself we play on is a little plain and I do hope in the future we get a couple more boards to mix up the dueling.\n\nEach of the planeswalkers has been granted a set of cards that is not only balanced but very workable, and you obviously get one double-sided planeswalker card to play in each deck. These cards are quite fun to mess around with in game. In 2HG they really seem to make a difference at the right time. A nice little addition to the series for sure.\n\nDual and Tri-colored decks are easily made within a few booster packs after the campaign is completed. Each color is more balanced in itself and against others more than any other year of Magic, especially the years up to 2014, which were horrifically imbalanced to the point of deck tiers being so out of whack it was unreasonable. To me the card pool so far has been fantastic, with some old favorites melding perfectly with newer cards to create a welcome and diverse array of creatures, lands, artifacts, enchantments, and spells. I especially appreciate the dual colored lands in various setups.\n\nThe boosters for gold work well within the context of leveling up and paying for the game. You can buy gold as wel if you want to spend money for the collection of cards instead of grinding. You don't have to pay, but then you will have to make some good decks and win a lot of games to acquire said boosters, which have 6 cards each. All in all there are about 80 of them to have the full collection on display. And what a great collection of cards it is. Superbly balanced for possibly the first time in ages, though, I did not get around to playing 2015. The inclusion of 2HG alone makes the game that much better.\n\nThe bugs in this game are there for sure. But it's hardly worth mentioning them, as I will mostly just have to update the review when they are fixed. The community challenges briefly mentioned above are a bit buggy. 2HG could surely use another patch or two. And there are limited number of cards that don't always seem to work correctly. But all in all I find these things a minor headache. And this is coming from someone that protested 15 and never even bought the thing, even on Steam sale. I am very satisfied with this game up to this point. It remains to be seen what they do with expansions and further patching. I will update the review when needed.\n\nIn the end, Stainless certainly seems to have learned from some of their mistakes at least. But a few things remain to be included in the platform here, which is still a very solid foundation. These things include more modes, 2HG gold, chat, bug fixes, and possibly an option for things like hold priority and more UI tweaks. Yes, the game is not complete. But this is just the start of Magic in the new DOTP realm. It's hard for me to understand why so many people are writing with extreme anger all the time when their game doesn't work for a few days or hours. Find something else to do! You didn't pay for this game. It just came out. They had servers fixed within a couple days.\n\nAll I can say is don't trust these reviews too much or their hyperbolic opinions of the game. Trust longtime Magic players who are usually not people that tend to massively overreact about small problems. I too have hated on Stainless a fair amount, but I feel I can give them the benefit of the doubt here.\n\nAs always, new players need to remember to cut your decks to about 60 or 61 cards with 22-24 mana on a normal dual-colored deck for this game. Make probability your friend. Think abstractly and play a lot of games versus the AI at first before you enter against seasoned players with great builds. If you persevere I see no reason you cannot win and succeed at the game.\n\nIf Stainless can fix the small amount of problems this is easily the best card game on the market. Hearthstone can eat its heart out.","August 5, 2015","true","573.5"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","45","76","3","7"

Unfortunately, I have to say that this game has been a huge disappointment. Aside from all of the glitches/technical problems that others have mentioned, I have found the story mode to be unbearably boring and generally not fun. My main issue is that, in DOTP, you could choose the deck you like at the beginning and then gradually unlock cards that you can use to modify it as you go along. You could also unlock new, better decks as you work your way through chapters. In Duels, however, you get stuck with a new, terrible 'intro'-level deck for each chapter of the story. These decks are not possibe to modify; when you unlock new cards, the game just throws them in there without consulting you. There's nothing fun about playing with a deck entirely composed of crappy 2/2 creatures with no discernable combo opportunities. It basically just boils down to replaying each incredibly boring opponent over and over again until, eventually, you can widdle their life down to zero. This might be an OK model for people who are just now learning to play, but people who actually have a moderate grasp of the game will probably just feel like it's a huge waste of time.","September 6, 2015","false","5.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

When are you guys going to learn this game type sucks? Everything about it just sucks, from the limited card selection that makes building a synergized deck impossible, to forking over obscene amounts of money for randomized booster packs. As in, pay up and you might get some good cards. The whole freemium pricing model in general makes me and my future children's children weep.\n\nVirtual MtG's strength lies in the creativity of its developers, who are at their best when making their own decks for players to use and tweak. If someone wants to build a deck from scratch, chances are they're going to invest in the actual paper cards, instead of this nickle-and-dime operation.\n\nWizards/Stainless sees the wild success of Hearthstone and thinks "Aha! So that's how we do it! Just charge for everything separately!" And so now we enter a dark age where 'free' content is sold to us through micro charges, subscriptions and payment plans. This will eventually culminate in an Orwellian nightmare-verse, where we are forced to wear bomb collars in the form of license agreements for our games.\n\nEither let players grind out the cards or think of ways around the Pay2win philosophy, like making cards tradeable (other than Infinity Wars, this has yet to be done in any CCG I've played so far). It would enable better in-game and real-world economy, which would then maybe branch into its own card-swapping community. All it would take is some simple software to set up trades between players and might even encounrage them to buy your blasted boosters in case that trend isn't going away anytime soon.","August 12, 2015","false","16.0"," 36 of 60 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","36","60","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steelcent/recommended/316010/","Steelcent","Athene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steelcent/","24 products in account","I have played magic since 5th edition and have several MTGO accounts. Hasbro has a reputation of not funding magic products appropriately or otherwise short-changing or whoring out the franchise. In that regard - they do not dissapoint here. They live up to the hasbro name. This game is ready for a technical alpha - it should not be released atm. There are many issues from crashes to bugs- some more annoying bugs might be the inabbility to earn more than one fifth of a single booster pack in a day because the game cannot accurately keep track of how much gold you have earned.\n\nI do not expect this product to be properly supported at all. This is not the type of game which will recieve regular patches and updates. It is the type of game which hopes you buy a bunch of boosters and suffer through buyers remorse when one content update occurs a year. Do not fool yourself into thinking the game is or will ever be more than it is currently.\n\nThis game is a cash grab. It does not hold a candle to hearthstone in any way. It has less cards, it doesn't reward ranked play (hearthstone pays dust and gold cards based on monthly rnaking now), it is covered in bugs, it has irreputable companies involved which are not known for good digital products, it hasn't recieved a single update since I have played. There are no plans for the expansion of this game; there is no information available for any direction it is supposed to take. This game is not supported in any way (no future, no lore, no story, less than 5 paragraphs on the damn wizards website). Hasbro should burn to the ground for what they have done with the magic franchise.\n\nThe game is a complete let down for me. Heartstone will continue to lead the trading card game market into the future and hasbros share of the market will continue to shrink compared to the mamoth blizzard entertainment. It is evident they do not want this game to succeed; but stingy lazy hasbro will pretend this was a good effort and pat themselves on the back as they sink.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/esperflame/recommended/316010/","esperflame","Esperflame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/esperflame/","73 products in account","So as an old MtG player and a Duels of the Planeswalker player, this is by far the worst version of MtG to date. This game has tons of bugs which have been around since the launch of July 2015. The progression system is purposely slow to encourage you to dump actually money to unlock cards. They also removed the option to manually progress each phase which can cause problems as the game will sometimes completely skip a phase even though you have a legitimate action to take.\n\nIt used to be in Duels of the Planeswalker, you could grind bots for your cards. Each game versus a bot would get you 1-3 cards depending on the unlock. Now you earn 6 cards after 15 games and no I'm not counting quest coins because half the time the quest rewards bug out and refuse to progress. This isn't the worst part though. They have also restricted the number of gold you can earn each day which you use to unlock cards. Each pack costs 150 gold with no price deals for buying multiple packs and a cap of earning 400 per day. This is all to wear people down with a crazy grind and tempt/force people to spend actual money to unlock cards, but it gets worse. It used to be when you spent actual money to unlock cards, you would spend $5 to buy a key which would unlock all the cards assiciated with a particular deck which would usually involve 30ish cards of which about half were rares or better. Now $5 gets you 500 coins which is enough to unlock 3 packs and have 50 coins left over netting you 3 rares or better, 6 uncommons and 9 commons. Thats a considerable drop to what you used to earn overall on all fronts of unlocking cards. This s clearly purposeful to milk players of cash.\n\nThey have removed the option to require players to manually progress each phase. I have on several occasions had legitimate plays stolen from me because the game would skip the second main phase and go immediately to end phase. I've also had the game deny me legitimate plays when I stop the timer at end phase. For example, I have a black/red steal sacrifice deck. If I use all my mana to steal your creature, because I have no mana left the game assumes I want to end my turn before I can sacrifice your creature to my Nantuko Husk so you don't get it back. Sometimes it even glitches out and when I stop the timer in my end step to try and do this, it removes the highlight around Nantuko Husk now allowing me to sacrifice the creature while the timer is stopped which means my only recourse is to start the timer again and as quick as I can activate the sacrifice ability and if I mess it up somehow and the timer finishes, they get their creature back. MtG isn't a game of rushed responses, it's about making tactical descisions which this game doesn't seem to like.\n\nAnd finally theres the bugs which have been in this game for almost a year now since the launch. The Quest rewards don't work half the time and the only work around is to play with a deck made using the Deck Builder Wizard which sure is decent if you have no clue how to build a deck, but to those of us who have been playing MtG since Legends/Dark/Antiqueties, the pre-made decks are a joke. Also there's a bug in the store when you buy coins that can force you to have to deal with customer service to get what you paid for. Finally, there is the in-game mechanic bugs. When I play 2 headed giant with a friend of mine and go to activate fire breathing on my enchanted flame-kin, half of the time the ability just completely bugs out. It will activate but then sits there with the timer almost in a frozen state. After the timer ends it will use only one mana completely wasting my time as I do this 5 or more times without once popping up the menu that asks how many times I wish to pump up my creature.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't recommend this game to anyone as to me it feels like a giant buggy game designed to scam you out of as much money as possible.","May 17","false","58.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

How could I playing two-headed giant?\n\nOn top of the coin cap there are also caps on cards just like in previous MTG video games. You can't run multiple copies of the same card up to the proper number of 4 copies of any single card because some cards apparently are too powerful.

I understand that most, if not all, online games launch with some server issues. But come on, none of their DOTP games launched with this many issues. I'm thinking that WotC didn't really care all that much about making sure this game ran at least semi-smoothly at launch because it was free. Also, making it so you can only earn gold coins while online can  be problematic for users when the game disconnects while you're in the middle of a match, so even if you win you don't get what you've earned. And now I can't even get online at all. And to top it off, I mean, why is this game available for Steam and ipad users, but not available on android?

It doesn't award coins for playing against friends or playing two-headed giant.  I think they are fixing the 2HG issue, but it still seems dumb that I can't earn even 5 coins for playing against a friend\n- The amount of cards and card sets available to play with is fairly small right now.  It has plenty of gameplay possibilities just with what it has right now, but it's hard not to want some more of the vast number of card sets available in the physical game\n- For such a relatively simple game graphically, the performance is generally a little slow both in connecting to the network and in gameplay\n\nConclusion:\n\nUnless you are already a Magic afficianado, this is simply the best way to get into and play Magic which is the best collectible card game around.\n\n9.5 / 10.0","January 28","true","82.9"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","39","66","3","2"

This is magic the gathering. So why the thumbs down?\n\nWell, for starters, the campaign is short, gruellingly annoying, and so stacked against you its replayability is simply waiting for the AI to be land or creature screwed so you can win. Half of the cards you are give NOBODY would EVER use. They are the most terrible decks you can build, and then the AI you fight has a deck specifically designed to counter yours. Its not hard, its quite litterally impossible. (Unless the therefore mentioned land or creature lacking hand)\n\nThis isnt what magic is about and the developers of this game should be ashamed to have created this pile. I dont even want to get into the numerous cheaty bugs the AI have pulled. Attacking without tapping without vigilance, card effects without the prerequisite action happening, and sacrificing a creature after its dealt its damage and received fatal damage for its effect.\n\nI would love to see a hard but fair mtg game in this, but simply put, its designed to make you grind it to win. With 15 land cards being pulled in a row, or you have 1 land and 12 useless cards in a row. While this happens yes, it doesnt happen every hand. When you do finally get a good hand, and your deck plays as well as it possibly can, the AI always has the perfect counter that not only shuts you down but kills you. Like a 7/8 flying trample on turn 4..... Against a water deck with NO COUNTER SPELL....\n\nAlso just found out, you can not build a deck with fewer then 15 land, period.

However, with such a simple design, you would expect being able to play with others should be simple and easy to do. You can find an opponent but the game will spend ages trying to connect the two of you only to get a message saying they cant do it. Two headed mode is also a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can invite a friend to play but you cant decide if you play together or against each other. Instead of making the game playable the developers want to release new content when the current content is broken. Nobody wants new broken stuff. It also has a pay to win mechanic. Either you spend money on the broken game to get a chance of having decent cards or you have to grind through an unplayable game which exits randomly in the middle of a card game regardless of it being AI or human. You dont get to complete. You only get rewards for a win. I do not reccomend this game to anyone because even if you pay for lots of booster packs, you cant use them anyway. With the recent expansion you can clearly see which way the developers are going as no bugs were fixed and im sure many new ones have appeared instead. Releasing new content to make you open your wallet without even bothering to fix the game is utter disrespect which is a problem with game developers as of recent times.","April 8","false","98.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

It was free, and consisted all standard decks with good lore in the tutorial, very easy to get a hang of. In fact, contrary to the other Magic games, this one actually gave you a vanilla liberty to create your own deck.\n\nBut as I grew accustomed to this game, I noticed how AWFUL this game is. Here are some points that you, as Magic player, really need to be aware of:\n- You are not granted full deck-creating liberty. The developpers have excluded many cards from the sets (like Stasis Snare or Stone Haven Outfitter).\n- On top of the point above, they are disallowing you from using more than 3 uncommons, 2 rares or one mythic each type of card. That's absolute BS.\n- They will not add any cards Pre-Origins. Even cards from high-demanded sets like Modern Masters, Tarkir or Ravnica, are not going to be in there.\n- The start for experienced Magic players is extremely frustrating. It takes a lot of time (-or money) before you finally get a good card for your deck.\n- The matchmaking in a game is horrible. Here you come with a few matches played, with your 90% starter deck, expecting to be able to fight a rank 18 player with a full custom deck.\n- The worst, worst, WORST thing of this game, is that crashes are EXPLOITABLE. There LITERALLY is a way to make the other person's game crash (or permanently stall), and the developers have STILL not fixed it! People can make you lose deliberately if they were on the losing end. I can't believe the developpers are not seeing this!\n\nThis game is absolutely broken. It's either grind- or pay-to-win, the game is horribly easy to abuse/exploit in terms of making the other person instantly lose by letting their game freeze/crash, this game has SO many no-go's in what a game should be like.\n\nI had my time done on this game. Time to head back to my local game store and play some real MtG there.","May 31","false","39.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","5"

Especially since it's FREE! Getting through the tutorials and can be a little annoying; however, the gameplay is solid.\n\nNoteworthy things!\n- Deckbuilding could use a tweak to allow a player to see more than, like... 6 cards at once; if not all cards; they have filtered since there's a zoom function. Without something like that implemented, it feels... "squeezed" together. I'd go so far to call it "claustrophobic".\n- Card Selection on the main menu will show you the cards you have/don't have so it's nice. Apparently, uses only the Origin set. Hence, the title. But from the description, more sets will be added.\n- Story mode is neat. Pretty cutscenes (for the styling) tell how the planeswalkers came to be.\n- The forced wait time... Just... No.\n- The Easy (Goes to Medium and Hard) mode AI will kick your butt. Just sayin'. At least there's a challenge! Have yet to play past Medium mode cuz, well, let's face it... need 'dem good card combos.\n- You can get every card entirely for free. However, there's an option to pay for the in-game currency; which if you have a problem with spending habits then you probably shouldn't play this.\n- THERE IS TWO HEADED GIANT (Team game, for the new folks) and 1v1 mode. Free for All was overlooked though. Dunno if it'll be added or not since the game's new. Hopefully it will be! I've played the Two headed Giant mode a few times, and it seems to work without issues thus far. If a player drops out, they are replaced with the AI.\n- So far, one crash after playing for several hours in the AI vs. mode. It didn't reoccur.\n\nI'd recommend this if you are new to Magic. But, experienced players can have some fun out of it too. Just remember there are gameplay options that, if disabled, make the game more like the TCG (Things won't automatically happen).\nFirst game review ever, too. Jeez. Guess that tells you how much I like the game, eh? :)\n\nAfter playing it for a few days, I'd rate it 7.5/10.","July 31, 2015","true","22.4"," 65 of 118 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","65","118","3","0"

After finishing games and quests, I don't seem to receive gold half the time. Sometimes it jumps up the next time I log in, but I'm sure there have been occasions when I haven't received gold for quests at all. I'm also not receiving new daily quests at all at the moment, which is annoying as I wanted to build up a few more cards before properly playing in versus mode. Hopefully they have fixed the connectivity issues now, but I've lost gold several times due to losing connections with the servers after finishing a match, which is also very irritating.\n\nFor the actual gameplay, I feel that the layout and the way games are played works well enough. I think there have been some really bad decisions made for the campaign and quests though. The campaign is supposed to help new players learn to play the game, but even though I've been playing for a few years now I had to repeat a number of the campaign missions over and over again. The decks you are given aren't very strong against the decks you are facing, and as you can't change them you just have to keep starting over and over again until you draw a perfect hand and then draw the cards you need for most of the game.\n\nI also think the deck wizard is terrible. Any decks I've built with it have been really weak, and you aren't able to amend them afterwards. I don't understand why they didn't stick to how it was done in the previous duels of the planeswalkers games. Duels 2014 was the first of these games I played, and it was a much better way for new players to learn. You got given several pre built decks, with a few extra cards you could add or remove, and as you unlocked more cards you could make bigger changes. That way, you started out with a decent deck, and could fine tune it as you played with it to make it fit your style. I think this game would have been much improved if it just had a template deck for each colour combination, and let you add to it and take cards out as you unlocked new cards.\n\nWhat I hate most about the deck wizard, though, is that you have to use decks built with it to complete the daily quests where you have to win with a certain colour combination. As half of the fun of Magic is building your own decks, I don't see how they thought this was a good idea. Every new quest you have to build a new deck, with the wizard withholding cards you know you want in the deck and making a mess of your mana curve and lands. I pretty much only play these decks against the AI on easy, because they just aren't good enough to play any other matches.\n\nWith regards to the cards in the game, I think the decks you can build are fairly balanced, nothing is going to be too poweful, and I don't feel the game is pay to win. I haven't played a lot of versus mode games, but I've never felt I was beaten because the other player had cards I didn't have.  The problem with it is that they seem to have done this by removing any interesting cards and leaving less powerful cards. After looking at the cards you can collect, there don't seem to be many at all which are over 6 mana. I guess it means that you can't keep buying packs until you get game winning high mana cards which other people don't have, But I always felt a lot of the fun in this game was managing to play your expensive and very powerful cards.\n\nI think the game does have potential. But even though I was looking forward to this for weeks before it was released, most days I just can't be bothered to play it. The bugs are annoying, the daily quests are boring and grindy when they actually appear, and there just doesn't seem to be much interesting to do with the cards available. Without any kind of communication with the other player, the versus mode is a bit dull as well, and half of the time players will drop out after drawing a bad hand and you play the match against the AI anyway.\n\nOverall, I think the game could be decent in future, but at the moment the bugs and weird design decisions make it really difficult to just have fun while playing it.\n\n\n","August 22, 2015","false","306.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Giant oversights.\n\nGood potential but this game hovers between borderline unplayable on a good day to infuriaring frustrating on a bad day.\n\nFirst of all, it's been plagued by connectivity issues since the first day. The developers offered some coins recently to make up for it and have made some strides to fix the connectivity issues, but they don't make up for the multitude of lost matches, lost coins, lost progressions, and simple inability to play two head giant with your friend.\n\nSecond of all, the UI is atrocious for the PC. It's clearly a port from the mobile versions that came out before the PC edition, and there has been little to no attempt to take good advantage of the mouse and keyboard a PC player would use.\n\nThird of all, there are many, many glaring oversights. There have also been countless times where either an oversight or glitch has caused the match. If you didn't turn off easy targeting in the gameplay options, and you're running a deck with black cards or that involve sacrificing, you'll find (at the time of writing) that easy targeting doesn't allow you to attack yourself or heal an opponent (valid strategies for the more advanced players). There would have been no mention of this until you tried it out in mid battle. There have also been countless times where the game has skipped my main phase (usually the second one, but also the first) or my battle phase. I've been unable to choose my blockers after having pressed the pause timer button and resuming.\n\nAll the pros to this game are due to the card game itself. There has been no time where I thought to myself, "Wow, that was a really nice implementation of the card game." In case you're wondering about the hours I've put in, keep in mind I've played the physical card game before as well as played the iOS version when it first came out. All of the glitchiness that version had when it came out got ported right to the PC version, and all the complaints I've mentioned have come from the PC version. I was hoping the PC version would have had the time to fix a lot of these issues, but they haven't. It's actually worse off, because at least the UI makes sense for a tablet not a PC game.\n\nThe game implements the virtual currency in exchange for real world money or time that all f2p and mobile games use. If you don't like that in mobile games, you won't like it here.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. It's too buggy with many oversights on the basic fundamentals of the game. The few good times I've had do not make up for the intensity of the frustration of losing a match due to a fault entirely on the game itself and not due to your skills, or going through an annoying campaign mission only to find out that the game lost internet connection (on an always connected PC) and none of your progress will be saved. A lot of people I know have complained about the lack of cards, but I'm more worried and upset about the very bad foundation they've set up to worry about any future card expansions. I would recommend to wait until they fix these fundamental issues.","August 13, 2015","false","174.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

But most of these I haven't experienced myself. With a good, stable internet connection it should be fine, and I feel like bugs have gradually been removed.

I do wish there were an choice i the beginning where you could choose if you where an already experienced player or a beginner though, but you can't have it all.\n\nThe gold earning in the game is fair for a F2P game with the possibility to buy coins if you WANT to.\n5 coins for an easy opponent, 10 for a medium, 15 for a hard and 20 for a player vs player win (with the bonus of an extra 20 for your first win of the day against a player) on top of the quests and the gold you get from the storylines. I have never felt that I needed to buy coins, some diligent playing and deck building experience will make it easier to earn after a while. (It goes ALOT faster than heartstone in my opinion!!)\n\nSome people say that the AI is sometimes too good even at easy, but as always in magic a good hand is a good hand no matter if you are an AI or not. It is a game of luck in some sense, as these games usually are.\n\nSo my final conclusion is: Magic Duels is better than no magic at all. And as a F2P I think it is an OK one! :)","January 19","true","234.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

And I will be honest, as much as hardcore MTG fan, despite all the positive rating on main page, this game is BARE BONE at the moments. It is so small it makes Hearthstone look like World of Warcraft. There is very little content available, for example, there are only around 200+ cards, which is a joke compare to other TCG, ex: Hex, Hearthstone, or even Classic Magic Online. Two Head Giant mode (2v2) is back, but what is the point if half of the players could not start the game and it takes hour to find match.  And let's be honest this pc game playerbase is not large either.  You can't even manual set 2v2 with AI teammate like Duels of Planewalker either. That is about it, there is no additional mode like Planewalking or Archenemy.\n\nBottom line, they took out more contents than they add.\n\nAgain, I refuse to spend any money until i see some SERIOUS bugs fix and please, very please, for variety sake, please ADD MORE cards.","August 11, 2015","false","237.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

I have been continuosly shocked that every version of magic games released since 2013 have been worse and worse since then leading to magic duels. This game is possibly the worst version of magic I have played. It's only redeeming feature is that it doesnt make you spen your money to learn how absolutly horrible this game is. The story mode is atrocous and requires you to play perfectly, draw perfectly and the computer to draw horribly to win anything past the tutorial. The enemy decks are perfectly suited against the deck your playing and the amount of mana in your deck borders on ludicrous. The deck building is awful and unintresting. I can only imagine the reason for this is to prevent you from getting free coins and trying to force you into buying them.

I thought.\n\nI thought so bad.\n\nAfter testing the game... story mode is not so bad. But the game IS a cash grab, even more worse than Hearthstone, which Magic Duels claims to have followed the same model. I'm sorry, but in Hearthstone... you actually have SOME GOOD CARDS to start. On here, it's just awful.\n\nOh, and getting boosters (By defenition, a Magic the Gathering booster pack is 15 cards, but on here it's 6 cards, so who cares!) is a drag. Battle mode easy AI are equipped with cards you would DREAM to have - but won't until you play 60 hours of those.\n\nPlaying versus players is simple - either you are against people who paid 50$ to get 32 boosters (which is 192 cards... i think i'll buy real life cards, they cost less, thank you), or either you are against the same people as you - which means 20 turns games... for pocket change.\n\nAs the game is now, you lose either way.\n\nOh, and there's daily quests to get coins! Yay.. or not. Because it requires ARCHETYPES deck - so you can customize it A BIT.\n\nHonestly, i'd rather pay 10$ like for Magic 2015 to get the same type of unlocking (get a booster after clearing a story mode mission OR winning a ''random encounter'' in a plane) than this.\n\nOnly good point : It was free to test.\n\nAs the game is, I CAN'T and WON'T recommend it.\n\nEDIT : After giving the game a second chance, i found out that sometimes, when you manage to do those hassles that are the quests... the coins they give is not always given. Just to add to the list of cons already big enough...\n\nUPDATE (As of 2016-01-27) : Six months later, is the game better?\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Still not getting the right gold amounts from daily quests, or it simply erases what i had saved up to now and gives me the ''correct'' amount. Must have lost like 600 gold this way up to now.\n\n- Hard AI as NO diversity (I do not play against Easy and Medium now.. i mean, 5 or 10 coins a game is so few). By that, i mean : Always splashes white, always play control, as soon as you know which cards do what (Looking at you, Gideon's Reproach), hard is... well, it's 15 coins. When it doesn't bug out.\n\n- Both me and a friend opened a ''phantom'' booster. It shows the cards you got from buying... then no cards in the card collection. Kinda mad since i had finally a Kiora...\n\nI can't believe such bugs still exists many months after the game's launch. Seriously.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- Battle for Zendikar added some diversity AND some good cards that are actually usable.\n\n- That's it.\n\nYes, i played about 55 hours because i had faith it could become better. The people managing this game (if there are any other than ''Mod_Chris'', because game content updates are as rare as black lotuses) could probably do much better... or just change the people managing the game. A passionate community managed to do over 3000+ cards over a few months that are all working, why can't a game company paid to do so can't?\n\nAnyway, still not really worth it. Try it if you want though, it IS free-to-play, but i won't ever consider paying them a penny for the game as it is.","August 18, 2015","false","74.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The gameplay and story weave nicely together to create an interesting and exciting campaign.  The graphics and sounds are mostly great: not much artistic or technical prowess is needed for a digital card game, but the few cutscenes definitely could have been more polished.\n\nControls work well enough, but some elements of the game's earlier mobile design leak through.  For example, many gameplay controls are placed in the lower righthand corner where a quick thumbpress is perfect for some hardware, but rather clumsy for others.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem with Magic Duels: Origins lies in its value.  While certainly worth playing for the story, Magic Duels has so little worth beyond its campaign.  Every card could be collected given enough time, but in-game transactions speed the process tremendously.  Why spend the money?  To reach the top rank of this year's beginner program? The money would be better off spent on Magic: the Gathering Online or on the actual cardboard.\n\nNot as terrible as Chimney Imp, but not as terrific as Storm Crow.\n\n4/10","August 4, 2015","false","15.0"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","22","37","3","7"

First impressions are Bad.\nPros:\n1. It's Magic: The Gathering. If you like that, or similar games, you'll probably have fun with this.\n2. There's plenty of tutorials which seem helpful (If a little heavy handed at times) to help new and unfamiliar players.\n3. It's FREE!\n\nCons:\n1. The servers are terrible, and you will be frequently disconnected, or offline.\n2. The game is effectively unplayable while offline.\n3. Number of cards available is relatively small.\n4. Prepare to grind in order to get more cards, unless you're willing to fork up some cash.\n\n\nAt the moment, I would not reccomend this game. The biggest complaint I have about the game is the fact it requries you to always be connected to their servers, even for the singleplayer content. This would not be nearly the issue that it is, if it were not for the fact that the servers go down very frequently at the moment. The game allows you to "play" while offline, however nothing that is done offline will be saved. Progress in the campaign, singleplayer matches against Bots, and even decks created while offline will not be saved. You will also not be rewarded in anyway for wins while offline, even if the game was connected when the match was started. This can be very frustrating when you find out a hard earned win will net you nothing because of the servers.\n\nBesides the connection problems, so far the game seems relatively stable. The deck building "wizard" is a significant improvement over the one from Magic 2015, and you start with a lot more cards available at the start of the game. However as a Magic player, I'm disappointed by the relatively small pool of cards overall. Like Magic 2015, there will be a lot of cards which are in the game, but that you cannot collect and add to your custom decks. Annoyingly, the bots you play against in singleplayer matches, and the decks you use in the campaign will have cards which are unavailable to you for deck building. Also, those who have played Magic 2015 may of remembered that you get a booster pack of cards whenever you win a match. That has been removed, in favor of a coin system. The downside is that you can't buy booster packs from a particular set, and winning a single game will not net you nearly enough coins to buy a booster pack. Expect to be grinding a bit to find your coins. However, to counteract this, they have added challenges which you can complete to get extra coins. However, like everything else, you need to be connected to their servers, and any progress towards completing a challenge will not be recorded while offline.\n\n\nIf you're interested in playing Magic Duels, I would at the very least wait for them to fix the servers, or for enough people to give up so that their servers can handle the load. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking somewhere else to get your deckbuilding card game fix.\n\n\nSidenote; I will be updating this review as I am able to put more time into this game. At the moment, the servers are down too frequently to get a clear picture of the game as a whole.\n\n\nAfter some additional playtime I found this:\nIf the game does lose connection to the servers during a story mission, you can attempt to reconnect. However, even if you do successfully reconnect, it will not save that you completed that story mission, and the mission will have to be completed. Strangely though, it still gives you the coins and upgrades the deck as if the story mission had been completed. This seems to be a bug.","July 30, 2015","false","28.0"," 47 of 85 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","47","85","2","1"

I felt it would be fair to give Stainless and WotC the extra time to produce a passable game.  Sadly, this has not been the outcome.\n\nMagic Duels is a game that has so much potential, that it fails to even approach.  Free to play card games are generally well recieved in the video game market of 2016, and the amount of money that well made ones make is staggering.\n\nHowever, for some reason there seems to be a lack of desire or funding on the part of WotC or Stainless, or both, to put together the nessecary resources it takes to produce a functional video game.\n\nMagic Duels has the shell of a great game, but once you look inside you see the blemishes.\n\nNumerous bugs still permeate the play experience.  The netcode is slow and frequently does not match players correctly.  The game does not allow players to accomplish things that they should be able to do in a game of Magic (such as Transforming a planeswalker with an activated ability in the second main phase).  The shuffling algorithms seem off.  The game doesn't even teach the correct rules of Magic, instead making stupid conscessions in the name of simplification that instead only serve to misinform.\n\nI really, really, really wanted to write a positive review of this game.  I was waiting for the March update and resting judgement until they had a chance to get it released and tuned up.  I have given WotC and Stainless every chance to remedy this buggy mess of a game.\n\nUnfortunately, considering the current state of the game, I cannot reccommend anyone play this game, unless you are completely desperate to play Magic on your PC and you don't have the money to play MTGO.\n\nNot recommended.","April 14","false","244.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have played the magic card game for about 11 years and nearly all of video game versions they have released over the years. Not only is this version the worst one yet, but also a game with terrible design trends. It's like they looked at their Competition in the market and tried to copy them without thinking why those aspects were implemented in the first place. Hearthstone has booster packs with 5 cards, now so does Magic. Hearthstone uses a daily questing system and gold rewards, now so does Magic.\n\nIt makes me sick, it’s just lazy game design. The tutorial as well is horrid, even for this series of games. Ever wonder how trample worked? Well there is a god damn 5 minute long training game dedicated to holding your hand through it.\n\nIf it wasn’t free, I would say burn it. But it is free, so if you have an interest in the game and are just starting out, I guess give it a shot. Only until your eyes start bleeding though.\n\nEDIT: Well in light of this review actually getting some attention, allow me to go through some simple pro's and con's to give some qualification behind my silly rant.\n\nPro's:\n+The user interface is probably the best in the series. Considering the last installment's was slow and unresponsive, this is a good thing.\n+Plot is kinda cool, everybody like planeswalkers\n+It’s beginners magic, so that could be good\n\nCon’s\n-Tutorial is terrible. Like really, are player’s not supposed to read cards anymore to figure out what they do?\n-The cards they give you in the starter have very little synergy for play, resulting in extremely basic decks.\n-The actual games of the story missions are fairly dull and pre-set. They are more challenges of ordering and playing cards correctly, than a real game of magic.\n\nI have had some issues connecting to their servers as well, but that could simply be up to chance. It should also be noted that there really aren’t too many improvements since the last game. The odd thing about this is that some features that were good have been taken away. Any video game player would know the feeling of a rushed production, and this game oozes it.\n\nHopefully this brief break down helps some people out in understanding my frustration with an overly simple and uninspired game.","August 1, 2015","false","6.0"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","31","55","5","1"

I played though each line and I must say that they help flesh out each character, Jace, Chandra, Nissa, Gideon, and Liliana. It's also the initial way to earn coins which can be used to purchase boosters.\n\nSomethign else that is a bother, all the cards in teh story decks stay in those decks. You will not have the chance to add those cards to your personal collection, nor can you modify the decks. In this case, every in per story releases more cards for that story deck.\n\nWhen I actually get decent cards maybe I might try multiplayer. But for now, there's little much past the story mode.\n\nI have to say compared to the previous games, the UI is slightly imrpoved, but when the UI zooms the table out when there are more cards on the field, I admit that I feel a little insecure. I laugh at this, but it's an effect that I just don't care much for.\n\nI love the music. I do bemoan the fact that the soundtrack for this game is not available. The main theme is catchy and tends to be stuck in my head for hours on end.\n\nI won't do multiplayer in this game at all, because any game that is Pay to Win is just not worth it in my book. earning you first 1000 in coins isn't too terribly hard, but after that, you;re all on you own. You either have to grind or play against other people.\n\nBut this is where the game is more like the real one. Honestly, even with the real cards, it is pretty much Pay to Win. However, with a terribly limited selection and the fact that I invested heavily in the previous interation, I find myself terribly reluctant to drop money on this one. Especially when packs are selling in this game slightly more expensive. A pack of 5 cards sells for $1.99 Real cards sell 15 for about $4.50. You'd do better to buy the real cards and play with friends.","August 13, 2015","false","232.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The cost for this, however, is a punishingly slow unlock structure, that is made even more frustrating because of the low power levels they stick you with at the beginning.\n\nAs an example of how slow you can expect to unlock things in this game: I've spent 4 hours and have earned enough in-game currency to purchase 3 packs, i.e. 18 cards.\n\nThe Story mode is an attempt to fill in some of the back story of the various Planeswalkers, but it is generally an exercise in frustration. You are forced to use deliberately underpowered decks against competent AI with access to far better cards than you, which translates to you praying heavily on RNG for a chance to progress. I hope you enjoy trying to use Lilian's Black Cats to fend off an army of opposing Angels.\n\nAll in all, there is very little to recommend for this.

Only recommend for particular kinda of use.\nFirst of all, I haven't experienced any of the technical issues reported by many other users. (GTX 970, 4th generation i5 and 16GB RAM on Windows 7.)\n\nNow, on the good bits: they've finally got the interface to work well, unlike in previous renditions. It's clean, easy to use and easy to understand. (Both with and without a lot of the gameplay automation.) The tutorial system is excellent, and its monetization system is very fair (10 wins per pack just playing hard Bots + loads of money from story mode and skill quests.)\n\nBUT: the card pool is VERY limited, and the options you're given in the story mode are kind of misleading. A lot of fairly simple cards, like Lightning Bolt (3 damage to player or creature for a red) which appear in skill quests and story mode, don't appear in the game itself. This makes a lot of archetypes rather difficult to play, and restricts deck building options to the point where there seems to be little point in playing quite yet.\n\nTL;DR Overall, I wouldn't recommend this for longterm players, or anyone who already plays MTG. I would, however, recommend it as a free learning tool to get newbies into Magic.

(well at least the meta has) Also I made it to 20+ rank at some point, I get maybe it wasn't clear from my review that I got further than lvl 1 ;) I will update/delete this review once I get to play the new expansion extensively.\n\nUPDATE: I am not saying my problem is fixed but at least somewhat of a solution is to play mono aggro red or sacrifice/aggro black/red deck. I can pretty easily beat hard AI with these kind of decks even if the AI is pulling Planeswalkers, Legendary, Mythics etc etc However my point about progression and variety still stands in that because of the mana screw issues and limited card pool it seems that a lot of other 'slower' deck strategies do not seem to work.\n\nI really am trying hard to like this game but it is such a frustrating thing to get any progression towards a better deck!! Online there's only a handful of people and even though I consider myself a pretty good player there is almost no way to win from high level people that have either earned or bought better cards. It is really unfair because the people that have already build up a good deck will have a super easy time playing online, I regularly got matched up with lvl 10-15 even though I was level 1 myself.\n\nSo the only other way to earn credits to buy more cards and improve my deck would be singleplayer, which I've already finished and got pretty useless cards for in the boosters I unlocked. So now there's only AI matches which are frustrating but doable (see update). The AI cheats. I get consistently mana screwed every match and there's just no way you'll win if you only have the 3 mana in play that you got in your opening hand. (my deck has 24 mana)\n\nEither fix that or let me earn coins for playing a duel with my friends or in two headed giant because now all I can do is grind which is just awful! :(","October 16, 2015","false","141.7"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","25","44","4","10"

Feels a lot like Limited with a new Cube.\n- It's Magic (...buut, read on.)\n\nCons:\n- Game loves to help you out, by skipping steps when it sees you can't play anything in your hand, and not skipping when you can. This telegraphs that you do or do not have something to the opponent.\n- Game loves to help you out, by assuming that the sometimes-critical upkeep step is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and skips it entirely unless there's something already on the board that has to be done.\n- Each step gets the same amount of "response time" regardless what's happening. Play a tapped land on turn one: Takes just as long to progress as when your opponent plays a boardwipe when you have a counter. Now you can pause whenever, but you have to be on your toes or you might miss it (A real-time reaction speed "skill" that should never be present in MTG). Amounts to anything from a boring nuisance that you can't go faster to a real kick in the nuts when you lose the game because you're not lightning fast with a mouse.\n- Lack of any priority whatsoever. You want priority? Click faster than your opponent.\n- Artificial card limit restrictions based on rarity that appear nowhere in any regular formats of the game.\n- No chat.\n- If an opponent concedes, you don't win yet. You have to waste your time playing against an AI. If you happen to then lose, both of you end up losing rank and nobody wins in-game currency.\n- Card pool consists of a static starter box and the non-overlapping origins set that you get through money/playing. Static start results in a lot of similar decks and some rigidity to customization.\n- 2HG sometimes puts your friends on the other team. Doesn't really matter though because unless you're connected with another program, you can't chat anyway as already mentioned.\n- No FFA or other multiplayer modes beyond 2HG.\n-  Rank system appears to be a linear win/loss counter. That's alright though because there's no way to view leaderboards anyway.\n- Bugs and connectivity issues. Hopefully these won't be a long-term thing.","August 2, 2015","false","48.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

The only problem? It's so much a Pay to Win scheme that it's sad. I mean I have no issue with the pay option to get boosters, but the rate to acquire them are just plain atrocious. If facing against AI opponents, a victory garners 15 coins, a booster pack is worth 150. That's an average of 10 duels for 6 cards. Really? You guys couldn't just give us more to work with? The AI are jacked with decks with strategies that clearly outclass you in various degrees. Maybe it was my luck, but playing the same AI through story mode 10 times is not what I call thrilling or enjoyable.\n\nBut I will say there is one aspect I deeply enjoyed, Planeswalkers. Finally, it has only taken so many years to get this point. The custom deck builder is fun and user-friendly, but not the deck wizard, it's an abomination of a deck building alghorithm for new players.\n\nNot only that, these Quests (which are like daily things) where the Archetype ones involve using decks from the deck wizard are utterly annoying and not fun at all. But they give you free coins if you can just grind through them. It becomes a chore especially when they are using color combinations where you have not so great cards in those areas.\n\nThere is also one other feature I really was ticked about, in the older iterations of Duels, you could stop and pause the clock as an actual setting feature for every phase. Now? They got rid of it. You literally have to have the spazziest hands on this planet to hit either the Space Bar or the Mouse button on the hourglass icon. It's upsetting and while I understand that it streamlines the experience it really takes it away from the more experienced players who want to not worry about missing a chance to react to an effect or spell.\n\nI know I do not have alot of hours logged into this game, but that's because I play physical MtG. And this game does exactly that, it frustrates or inspires players enough to actually buy real booster packs and play the actual game. It's sad when you know that at the end of the day, that's the true aim and goal of this game's current incarnation. I just wish they had actually done some more material with actually more card options besides just Magic Origins. It's a good game to teach new players, but to keep tormenting yourself for enjoyment? No thanks.","October 5, 2015","false","9.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

You have to play with a premade deck vs decks that are only there to counter your every card. Best example is in the campaign of Nissa where you get a new treefolk card, only to have the enemy deck contain a card that specifically and exclusively kills treefolks.\n\nThe artistic design of the game is very lacking, you play every game on the same boring metal plate background. Everything except the cards is also just looking very boring.\n\nYou can build your own decks as you please, but the card pool is very tiny and aquiring new cards via gold feels more like doing chores.\n\nOne of the biggest issues though is the connectivity to the servers and to other players. Servers will randomly decide to be offline whilst you are winning - thus nullifying your victory. Also i will never understand why if a player concedes in a PvP versus battle he is then replaced by an ai - where if you lose, it will count as a loss and you will lose your rank and not get any money. Why should the game continue of my opponent gave up? I dont want to play against an AI if the other player just quits.\n\nAlso the game is expensive if you want to "pay to win".\n\nI can only see total beginners playing this game since it is free, but i fear they quickly will just become bored with it.","August 12, 2015","false","10.5"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

After awhile the bonus's of this free game started to fade.  Here's why I can't recommend the game.\n\n1. They have no chat system in place and as far as I can tell they don't plan to add one. Major downfall. Some times the games are slow and boring and at times you can't tell the difference between a person or the useless AI.\n\n2. They limit your decks. Once I built a deck of cards that cost 2 or less and it was a one color deck. The game wouldn't let me have less then 17 mana. Even though I had the 60 cards required. They have other restrictions as well.\n\n3. No reward for playing two headed giant. Why they discourage you to play with your friends is ridiculous. It also has no FFA. It's 1vs1 or Two headed giant with no reward for winning.\n\n4. The biggest reason of all, in 20 plus years they still havent fixed the issues of getting mana screwed plus or negative. It's an ancient flaw that they seem to ignore.\n\nIt's free so it doesn't hurt to try but I think it's a lost cause.

Unfortunetly these booster packs are locked behind pay walls and an impossible to beat single player campaign.\n\nEach booster pack can be bought for in game coins. The main way to unlock these coins is through the horrid single player. In campaign mode, you are given a level specific deck and cannot use your own. These levels are intentionally designed to be almost impossible. I tried 30+ times to beat the second set of levels. THE SECOND SET. I am an avid Magic player and know the game quite well.

Like, really all aspects. Starting from small visual glitches (like 'unsynchronized' pictures shifting in lines) and menu inconveniences (like 'frozen' loadings until you click) and ending with things that actually hurt gameplay (below). I even thought it's 'Early Alpha Access' (this new Steam category which allows developers to sell Alpha versions to players x)) and went to check - no it's not. Just THAT many things are not done / done poorly, it looks like game was done in a rush.\nMenu is constantly throwing same promo dialogue windows welcoming you to visit the shop. When you visit shop and/or buy a booster you get same promo dialogue window about new set, EVERY single time. Every time you visit deckbuilder, you get another window. Every time you visit 'versus' menu you get a window that you should probably play campaign first (when obviously all campaigns are finished). Since some windows can redirect you to other menu sections when you click 'OK' (and you can only click 'OK', obviously), once I was literally 'lost in menus', since one menu window was constantly redirecting me to the page where other window was redirecting me back. I had to ALT+F4. Hilarious. But that was probably the only fun moment in here.\nDeckbuilder is realised as badly as one could possibly do. Cards are all stacked in two rows (top row - cards not in the deck, bottom - cards in the deck) with no possibility to even sort! You can only watch through those rows by dragging them with mouse. Filters are all grouped up in a single button on top of the screen, which opens fullscreen filter menu. And OF COURSE there is no search by name. Because WHO THE HELL IN THE WORLD WOULD BE SO STUPID TO SEARCH A DAMN CARD BY ITS NAME.\nIn game things. Camera can't be controlled by any means. It is locked to isometric from your POV. When the table is full of permanents camera moves further away on its own. Turn phases are skipped or not skipped unpredictably. Even with all settings set to 'full control' (that any MTG player should do: free targeting, asking about 'may' abilities, skipping), I can't say how many times I skipped attack phase just because game already skipped first main for me. There is a 'mana tapping' hotkey yet I couldn't get it working every time - in some cases game actually lets you choose mana, other times just "lets hope my grey land with tap ability doesn't tap for mana now". Choosing blocking order just doesn't work, since blockers are shown on top of one another, and you can only click the top one. Turns to "check out blocking order that game came up with, by clicking on every blocker (mandatory)" :D. Searching for cards in library have 2 buttons: 'finish' and 'confirm', guess which one is correct, otherwise you won't get your forest (happened few times :D). There is a 'closeup card' hotkey, but it only works on card under your cursor or the card that WAS under your cursor last. So when an opponent plays something you have never seen, you must stop timer before it resolves, catch that card (which is flying from middle of screen to his side) with your cursor, then press 'closeup'. Also, if you accidently clicked and slightly dragged a card in your hand, you're done. There is no possible way to cancel the cast if you are 'holding' that card with left mouse button, not a single other key (ALT+F4 maybe, didn't try that one :D)\nBattle 'animations' (that came untouched from Duels Of The Planeswalkers) still feel as stupid as they were. I don't even know if a single player uses this feature, it just sounds like a parody.\nCampaign 'storylines' look like pathetic stumps of actual MTG stories (which, by the way, lie in the range between 'intriguing' and 'extremely complicated') and are used to show us how Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra and Nissa got their planeswalker sparks, plus 1 Zendikar campaign to unite 'em all. Each consist of 5 missions of playing boring precons against boring AI (first half are also filled with annoying tutorial things). At the end of each campaign, you are rewarded with short cinematics with HILARIOUSLY outdated graphics. Like, really from previous millenium, really. And then there is a huge sound mistake too - cinematics are made in very low volume, comparing to everything else, and after they end there is this annoying 'win' piece of music (the same you hear at the end of every single match). Straight after, no pause. So when you watch the video with amp and good speakers, at the end you will scare the sh*t out of your cat and all other humans in the house, 6/6 times, I guarantee you that.\nNon-campaign AI opponents have terrible decks with, seemingly, random cards and no deck ideas. For example, this colorless Eldrazi and allies are in every deck even where they are not fitting. Also maniacally overfilled with lands. So be ready - bots will have constant undeserved manafloods. Those duels with AI are not bringing you any MTG experience, at all; yet you will have to grind them for dailies at start when you have no cards, since you only have poor starter pack (with good dual lands 2 of each color combo, but 0 other rares) and ~7 boosters after you finish all campaigns and tutorials. That is, booster is only 6 card here (1 rare + 2 uncommons + 3 commons). At least basic lands are free and unlimited :D you can't choose art though.\nIn PVP duels if your opponent leaves the game, you did not win yet. AI will take his deck and keep fighting you! And probably win :D But you won't even know you are facing AI, since there is no message or anything. Well this is.. strange decision for CCG.\nNeedlessly saying, there is no card trading market. And shop is completely empty except for boosters.\nOh and there is Two-Headed Giant, but with no chat. Yes you can't talk to your ally, sorry about that. Since I never actually enjoyed 2HG in real MTG I didn't have courage to try it out here.\nThe good thing - foils don't drop randomly in boosters (at least I didn't see any :D) - instead, you can foil cards you have for small amount of gold, really cheap. There's no animated arts though (wink).\nAnd then, all those annoying and bad things are forgivable and I would probably play the game, if not for simplicity.\nSee, we have a basic set 'Magic Origins' and 'Battle For Zendikar', and I'm not even sure they are fully copied from actual sets. So from the whole ocean of MTG's diversity of mechanics, keywords and abilities we get just a couple to play with.

They instead removed most efficient spells at common or uncommon, replacing them with complete duds. I'd like to slap the person who thought Siege Mastodon would be more interesting to include than War Oracle. Ugh.\n\nHad the game given, say, a single card for each victory, then grinding for cards would have been tolerable. Even playing only ranked matches (ignoring quests, which require you to use the incompetant deck wizard to vomit up something for you to try and use) will give you a pack of six cards for every 7.5 victories. Victories. With a 25% loss rate (still decent), that's ten games of Magic for every six cards, which may or may not be of use. Playing against the AI will take ten VICTORIES for a pack of six cards. Again, this grinding might be tollerable if there were anything worth pulling in these packs. There generally isn't.\n\nHad the game even worked as WotC intended, it might have been barely passable. Instead, it's as if Stainless is trying to emulate the stability of MODO servers. Not a good plan.\n\nThey even stripped the ability to chat with online opponents, making the distinction between playing against a person or a bot almost meaningless.\n\nIt saddens me that, while many of the mechanical aspects of the game itself are decent, and it is still FTP Magic, I can't recommend Magic Duels to anyone other than complete novices (who will find this a decent, if completely patronizing, introduction to the game) or people with far too much free time on their hands. The only reason I've kept with this is that I fall into the latter camp currently.\n\n\nTL;DR: While this certainly is one of the worst DOTP games in recent memory (even falling short of the 2015 installment due to a completely bland card pool), Magic Duels is still Magic. Magic at its worst is still a decent game, despite Stainless's valiant effort to prove to us otherwise.

I don't recommend it because there are glitches dealing with the currency system -- honestly, currency that is purchasable with real money is the LAST thing a game should have problems with...\n\nHowever, I personally do not recommend it. Here are a few negatives:\n\n(1) In the many hours I have spent in this game, I have never encountered an AI that didn't play a land in their first five or six turns. I don't know if the AI "cheats" but I suspect so. I have been land starved after 4 lands in about 20% of my games using the decks given to me -- surely the AI is using similar compositions.

After completing the entire story mode including all the tutorials, I had enough currency to ... (WAIT FOR IT) ... buy six booster packs. The only thing sadder is that this is *significantly* faster than grinding in head-to-head games.\n\n(3) I have completed quests, seen the 40 gold checked and move towards my currency total, and then had no currency added.

Why was there no option to skip them? I have been playing MTG for many years, I don't need to sit through the basics. It also felt dumb to me that I had to then click mindlessly through their "skill challenges" in order to get more free gold, since they were basically just more incredibly dumbed down tutorials. What ever happened to the real challenges in these games? You know, the ones that actually made you stop and think about what to do in order to win? These ones are a complete joke.\n\nAnd the story mode? Complete garbage in my opinion. They give you incredibly basic decks for each of the famous planeswalkers, which you are then supposed to use against the much more powerful AI decks. Seriously?! It's complete BS. This is not even a matter of skill here - the decks you play against are simply way more powerful than yours. I even noticed that a lot of the match ups are against cards with abilities that you have NO answer for in your deck. You basically have to restart until you have a perfect starting hand, then hope that the AI draws as poorly as possible so that you have an equal chance of winning. How is this balanced or fun at all? Also, the fact that you have no idea what cards were added in between missions is incredibly annoying. How am I supposed to know whether or not I even have an answer to something the AI uses against me until I have seen all the cards I have in my deck?\n\nBut what REALLY ended the joy for me, was when I was completely robbed of my booster packs that I spent 8 hours forcing myself through the story mode for. No kidding. I decided that maybe I would have more fun if I just simply built my own decks and played against the AI in solo mode for a while, so that I could get enough cards to eventually make a semi-competitive deck for online play. But to my dismay, immediately after spending all my hard-earned gold on booster packs, I was shocked to discover that I was never given ANY of them. That's right, all my booster packs were mysteriously gone right after I spent my gold on them. No new cards in my collection. Nothing. Restarting the game didn't miraculously bring my missing booster packs back either.\n\nThe fact that this happened after my initial experience with the game has turned me off from it forever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Migelino64/recommended/316010/","Migelino64","Migelino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Migelino64/","148 products in account","I'd like to immediately point out that if you are looking for a way to learn the rules of Magic: The Gathering, and happened to spy this title in the free-to-play section and think to yourself, "A free way to play Magic that teaches me the rules and is intuitive? Yes please!", or if you're a veteran Magic player like myself and saw this thinking, "Oh boy, Wizard's released their new DotP game! I hope it's just like DotP201X and a far better improvement on DotP2015", then steer clear; you will be sorely disappointed at Wizard's newest "game" in the series.\n\nLet me highlight the good point first and give credit where credit is due.\nA deckbuilding system that is fairly lenient and pretty creative. Yes we had this in 2015 and it was one of the only good things from that game.\nA storyline that is somewhat fun and interesting to follow. Though the cinematics were a bit lackluster and can't hold a candle to Warcraft III cinematics from 2002, the lore following each planeswalker is a nice touch to add backstory. Then again you can look it all up on the internet, so that doesn't count for much.\nOrigins Cards and Planeswalkers. For God knows how long people have wanted planeswalkers in these games and we finally have them. Also a mixture of Origins and non-standard cards makes for some interesting decks, if you have the time to unlock them.\nEnjoy that little list of good stuff? Alright. Now let's bust some balls.\nBuggy interface and connectivity issues. This was inevitable. All DotP games have had some form of interface problem or online connectivity issue. Most usually get patched out fairly quickly. But needing to consistently reconnect to save coin progress? Enchanted creatures not displaying correctly after zooming? Spells and abilities mistargeting? Players disconnecting mid-game or having games hang? You'd be better playing MTGO.\nDeck construction limitation. This garbage again. 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares, 1 mythic. An attempt at balancing deck construction, but ultimately restricting our creativity with decks. I'd much rather have DotP2014's system of unlocking cards for specific decks, and have other decks as DLC packs.\nArchetype Quests. Apparently decks don't identify as a two-colour deck unless you use their deck building "Wizard". In short, you pick a card out of 5 shown to you. It then uses the cards you've picked to suggest other cards, place them in front of you, and you pick one. Not only does it feel like you're building decks in Hearthstone, these decks are horrendously underpowered in comparison to what a person with basic deckbuilding skill can create in the full deck builder. ~But you can't earn coins from quests unless you use the deck wizard~\nCoins and Boosters. DotP2014 had you pay to play Sealed, but that was fairly cheap and you got 6x 15 card packs. DotP2015 Had you unlock cards through campaigns on specific planes, but they were 15 card packs, and there was an option of some premium cards. What does this give you? 6 cards per pack, at $2 per pack Yep, if you don't want to play God knows how many games to save up 150 coins to buy 1x 6 card pack, you can pay $2 to get 150 coins to buy that pack. So it now becomes 3x slower than normal just to unlock the commons for my deck. And if I'm building a particular colour and the pack has nothing good for that colour? Oh well! Try playing more duels and saving more coins for another pack! Or buy coins to get the cards faster!\nThis game is a disaster. There are just so many issues with it; so many things that should not be. Had they just made a $15 game like in the past with pre-built decks and unlockable card pools for them, maybe everything would've been fine. DotP is supposed to be a fun way to introduce players to the game with interesting decks, and chaotic matches combined with unique game modes like Archenemy and Planechase. This is just a money grab, and a poor attempt at it. You shouldn't be paying for a collection of cards like this unless they're physical or on MTGO. If you're looking for a DotP game that is serious fun, I would lean towards DotP2012, 2013, or 2014. This doesn't deserve our time or attention.","August 1, 2015","false","11.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Battle mode allows you to play against randomized AI with 3 difficulty settings, where you get currency according to AI difficulty. There's a quest system in place which you can win currency with, along with a weekly community quest.\n\nOverall, it's a solid Magic the Gathering game, and in my eyes, for the hardcore MtG fans, the better alternative to Hearthstone.","August 1, 2015","true","8.1"," 66 of 125 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","66","125","6","1"

I played this game for free and I still feel ripped off.\n\nIf you want to play a card game online for free, there are tons of free Yu-Gi-Oh card games online. But I hear already,\n'This is Magic, not Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh sucks, Magic is better blah blahgblahbshas'\nThat doesn't matter, what matters is that any of those free games have Thousands of cards to choose from, and this pitiful piece of trash has cards from two sets. Those other games also give you all the cards, so you can just play. I hear more complaints,\n'But I want to get the cards, I don't want them handed to me at the begining, that way is for cheaters.'\nYeah, but at least it starts you with something! The starting cards in this game are a joke, and you cannot build a half decent deck out of them. Whatever you do build, will be on par or worse than the easy level ai, and with how you get cards (with coins, 6 or 8 at a time) and how you get coins (by winning, 10 at a time) you have to grind the easy bot before you can get the cards that synergize with each other enough to go onto the medium bot, so you can grind faster.\n\nThis wouldn't be too bad, maybe if the game wasn't so clunky and slow. Activating instants during the blocking phase is a chore, and during the damage step, physically impossible. Enevitabilities that you could just get over with quickly take what feel like eons when you have no cards to play and have to wait 20 seconds each turn to play a land and do nothing, while the opponent has a creature and is swinging at you for 2 until you die.\nTrying to retaliate with instants that require timing is next to impossible, and the way the game sometimes auto taps lands can really screw over a plan, especially when the system to choose which lands to tap (in the rare times it does that) has no explination on how it works and results in pressing every button on the keyboard until it taps the lands that don't screw you over. The quests can give you an extra couple of coins, but its still a tedious grind to open random cards that may or may not help make a deck that synergizes better than "this creature gets +1/+1 if you have an island."\n\nNo good cards to use at the start.\nBoring grind to get cards that don't suck like a lung.\nClunky and slow gameplay with various greivences.\n\nDon't touch this game.\n\nEdit: I forgot how awful the sound is in this game, but I have to mute my computer every time I play and when I went to go play something else it reminded me why after I unmuted it, everyone was still talking pretty quitely.\nAnd why is it that when the enemy quits, AI takes over for them! I play one game against a real person, and they leave so the AI can summon a 6/6 five drop and a planeswalker after practically boardwiping me.\nWhich makes me wonder about the matchmaking, since every single one of their cards wass foiled, they had a lot of cards I hadn't seen, and a freaking plainswalker, and I have jack crap in my entire collection.

But now since all these sets are coming faster than I have time on my hand I cannot recommend this game. If you notice, I have a good amount of hours on this game and I have Origins,BFZ, and maybe 1/3 Of Gatewatch and SoI unlocked. I Was lvl 50 in origins and BfZ 1v1 rank and had 3000 coins which only unlocked me maybe 40% of SoI. This game really makes you feel overwhelmed and bogged down with money and lack of content. You could buy the packs if you wanted, but what would be the point of buying cards that will be flushed out and have no value unlike MTG:O. I'd recommend this game to players who are new to Magic, but they too may see the Grind too overbearing and the amount of cards that aren't synergistic to be confusing. I think I'd rather them have all cards unlocked from each set rather than 60-70% of the set of all cards of the past 3 sets. This isn't the only game I play and its hard to keep up with the cards since I use this as a casual sit back version of magic for me. The restraint on the game is just too High to maintain fun. 6 card booster packs for $1.99 when you can only unlock 1 mythical, 2 rares, 3 uncommons and 4 commons is just too restrictive. Though I wouldn't mind it if there were more Synergy amongst cards. But now there are 4 sets in the game at this update and you'd have to unlock 60-70% of one set to make a decent deck. I cannot unfortunately recommend this game. You are better off playing cockatrice if you are poor and MTG:O if you want to spend money.","April 15","false","229.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's nice to see the Duels franchise come to a natural evolution of being a platform rather than a yearly iteration, it's free, but that's kind of where the good things about it end. It is very clearly designed not to compete with Wizards own MTGO with things like number of card limitations, the fact that it won't in fact add whole future sets, and to insure the grind gives 6 card boosters rather than the 15 that anyone who has ever played MTG would expect.

I play the game constantly and this isnt a bad way for an unexperienced player to start out, the tutorial is excellent and covers all of the basics.\n\nBut now for the bad...\n\nThe grind the grind the grind.  Seriously outside of "Story Mode" (which is pretty cool) there is no viable option to get cards. Its great that the "base" game is free-to-play, but honestly myself, and I think most others, would have preferred to drop the standard $10 to get a reasonable card base.  I actually did drop $10 to get some coins, enough to get me 8 packs.  Considering that there are only 6 cards per pack my $10 got me a whopping 48 cards!  Hows that for value?\n\nListen, its great that they added Planeswalkers, its great that "most" of Origins is available to unlock, but at this rate I'll never see them.  How about giving us the commons and make us grind for the rest?  How about add some cards from the thousands of others in the standard block?  It just seems like this game could be so much more, but for the 2nd year in a row it seems to have fallen on its face.\n\nHopefully the devs will read some of these reviews and make some valuable changes to the game, if so I may update my review, but as it stands I cant recommend this game outside of the story.","August 5, 2015","false","27.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Since it's free you should definitely play it just for the story mode.  Wizard/Stainless had one job.  Make a collectible card game(a 'CCG', if you want a TCG play cardboard Magic or MTGO).  They have failed, by definition of CCG.\nYou can't collect all the cards from the Origins set, and they've said that future expansions won't include all the cards either.  I did not expect to have every Magic card ever made, that would be far more work than I would consider viable.\n\nI expected, wanted desperately, to play Magic: The Gathering.  This is not Magic, you can tell because it doesn't have the cards you need.  They even have the gall to put cards into the single player campaign (which is pretty fun and close to real MTG) but not into circulation.  So it is not laziness on their part, it was a choice.

Certain 'may' actions require a target to be selected even if you do not wish to perform the ability.\n\nInterrupting gameplay to 'counter' or perform actions when you receive 'priority' features a very fast timer with inconcistent confirmation menus when the opponent plays cards.\n\nDeckbuilding uses a carousel menu to display selected and available cards, meaning once you reach ~20 cards in the 60 card requirements it will be frustrating to determine what you are using. Selecting a card will initiate a brief loading period as it displays the next copy of the same card or puts a different card in the slot you last clicked on so there is a lot of waiting to add 4 copies of a card to the same deck. Also building a deck features a missing save button so you have to attempt to quit from the deckbuilding screen to alllow the software to remind you to save your deck changes.\n\nSingleplayer gameplay is nothing more than trial and error to receive the opening hand that will win the game. While internet connectivity will ensure any other gamemode is at risk of wasting time.\n\nThe sound in the game is dominated by music that drowns out gameplay sounds to prevent the acknowledgment of the game making progress, and blurs the menus and gameplay together.\n\nWizards of the Coast do not hire competant programmers or have the managerial environment to allow large software deployments to occur for the complex game they have developed. Do not expect a digital version of Magic the Gathering to ever provide an experience you can be proud of. You do not have to pay for this version, so their incompetance cannot be rewarded.","August 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's only one set of cards, so they make the currency grind way slower than it needs to be. In the F2P market you need to keep my attention and not giving out SOME currency for EVERY game type and giving out SOME reward for a loss is just wasting the player's time.\n- There needs to be more options to speed up the animations and combat. There are some times that this is WAY too slow even after messing with the options.\n- Obvious mobile port.

It's pretty hidden though, so read the comments if you search for a way to change your avatar, background and so on.\nMeanwhile I played multiplayer, and I have to state: It's pretty fun fighting against other human players, but again here is potential wasted.\nWhy won't you allow Chat?

After a short spell of being servers down, I must say I was most impressed with whole thing.\nThe first of all, we have a real freedom in deck-building. Anyone can manage your own deck using cards from pool that he/she already own. All cards are free to players, but, at first, you should collect them.\n\nThe way to expand your own collection is to by boosters which include three common, two uncommon and one rare or mythic rare card. There are six cards in each booster, and you never become overloaded with any card. The cap for commons is four cards, for uncommon - three, rare - two, mythic rare - only one. So, when you reach a maximum level for any specific card, you will never receive it again. Hence, sooner or later you collect whole set. Card booster you can buy with in-game currency, which you can receive just for playing the game or buy with real money. To buy at least one booster per day is not hard task.\n\nGame have comprehensive tutorial and it would be easy to lean all basis for everyone. AI is sufficient to make a challenge, moreover, it is hard to run into the same deck when you playing against AI, because they are randomly customized at the beginning of each battle.\n\nHowever, game have several cons. The first, the graphic in videos is really obsolete. I think, developers should have made a slideshow rather ugly video. The second, and the most essential problem is deficiency in communication with other players. There is no opportunity to send any message to other players or to invite them to be fiends. Lack of feedback is unpleasant, because chatting with an opponent is an important part of fun which we want to receive from board games.\nOverall, this game deserve a high marks, and I believe it would be improved soon.\n7/10","September 8, 2015","true","326.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

This game runs an oversimplified version of the original card game while cutting corners. The original phases and steps of the turn are not in place for proper interactions with the cards, especially story mode cards. The game also lacks mouse key binding functions, something that I really wanted so that I could twitch my thumb to prevent the game from speeding out of control.\n\nOn top of those issues there is a bug where your enchantments fall off of your creatures when they are stolen, which is again devestating. I also want to know who designed the story mode decks. While each opponent you fight against has a flavorful themed deck, there is severe imbalance with the decks you are forced to pilot through out the mode. Seriously, I want to know which designer thought that having a mono-green morbid creatures deck going up against the second stage Lilianna was a good idea?\n\nEven though this is free I highly recommend that you skip this game, ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of the physical game.

This is especially sad because I am not a big fan of Hearthstone.\n\nWhile I had fun with Hearthstone at first, I soon realized that the game wasn't deep enough and the low card pool simply resulted in low variance and dull experience. It just simply didn't scratch the itch like Magic : the Gathering for me. I am not saying that Hearthstone is for noobs or something like that (Especially since I am pretty bad at the game.) the game couldn't simply compete with Magic which had years and years of releases and card pool of thousands.\n\nFor years, I was interested in trying digital versions of Magic the gathering. However, the horror stories kept me away from everything except Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014, which I still enjoy. There is a HUGE modding scene and I encourage everyone to check out.\n\nWhen Magic Duels Origins was released, I was interested in trying it out.\n\nAfter few hours of playing, I experienced the horror stories myself. The game crashes even though my computer CLEARLY surpasses the minimum requirment. Graphical glitches, server/connectivity issues, broken quest system, etc. I finally understood why Wizards of the Coast was infamous for producing technically incompetent products.\n\nIt is tragic that the game's fault isn't simply technically incompetent, but also flawed in game design as well. The card pool is extremely small. The game has roughly 250 cards in the game. Hearthstone, if I recall correctly, started out with more than 500 different cards and currently has almost 700 cards. If you read above, I quit Hearthstone due to lack of variance. This game is utter joke which fails to understand the strength of Magic the Gathering card game. What is the point of allowing players to design their own decks if you are not going to give them any cards to play with!?\n\nWizards need to realize that people are willing to pay money for solid, technically competent, fun, digital Magic product. Why won't Wizards take my money? I simply don't know.","August 29, 2015","false","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My review is still a non-recommend for this game. I just played the story mode for a few hours... Please save yourself the pain. The enemy has finished decks and you have unfinished non-counters to their deck styles... yet you can not pick your own deck. So they force you to be gimped while their npc is O.P. The second level of the story mode is more about getting absolutely lucky with your draws while the enemy get highly unlucky... so get ready to start your matches by chosing a new hand and when it penalizes you by not giving you 7 cards accept the hand and restart duel. I had a blue deck that was focused on making the enemy discard cards... but the deck seems to have at most 6 cards that have anything to do with discarding cards... I really do not feel like rambling and fully explaining. All i can say is the game just for me was not fun at all. I love magic and have played it for many years. This will not be something I play. It just seems like the devs are either way off base with the customers or they are way too elitest in the set up of the game. either way when it comes to me and probably a majority of the demographic I come from I can play magic in real life and from many other games forms.\n\nBTW your game does not play full screen windowed so i enjoy greatly not being able to play this absolute headache of a game fullscreen with part of the bottom of the picture cut off when using 1920x1080.\n\nI will review what I experienced. I was excited about the change to play a Magic: The Gathering game... I added the game to my library, Loaded it up, and got a beatiful view of the games Magic symbol. The screen then went black for about 20 seconds. With a woosh I was brought back into the light from the black screen to my normal desktop. In a confusion I looked around the screen trying to figure out what had happened... "Oh wait what is that?" I wondered. The game is opened and shows its symbol at my botton screen taskbar. I click it thinking it will open the game. "Oh wow the screen went black... the game is opening! WooHoo!" I said with happiness. To my surprise about 20 seconds later yet again the black screen goes away and brings me back to my normal desktop. This journey of Deja Vu was done multiple times and attempted over longer than needed periods of time. The happiness faded and now all I have to say is I do not recommend this game. It does not even look like anyone really replies to forum posts about this game breaking issue. I do not like it when a company does not reply especially on issues such as this. Sooo I do not recommend this game and if the way the company is handleing this issue shows anything I do not recommend this company. Sorry, but not sorry. Maybe if you fix your game in a timely manner I will be happy to play it and change my review to a review about the actual game and not your unplayable game.","August 18, 2015","false","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While Duels certainly looks cleaner than MTGO and isn't full of rude people, the support it seems to be getting from its publisher is pretty pathetic. Constant delays, incomplete sets, poor communication from the developers, no apparent mechanism to lodge bug reports or file comlaints... given that this barely feels like more than a reskin of the previous annual computer releases, the overal product is quite dissapointing. It's easy enough to play and they've increased payouts significantly lately, presumably to retain what players haven't been scared off yet, but given the competition games like Hearthstone provide these days, the most venerable CCG could--and should--have done way better.","March 12","false","253.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As it is now, DotP 2014 is a better game, and I would recommend you play that instead of this. I hope that the devs will put in the work needed to make this game live up to its potential.\n\nEDIT: 1 month later, still cannot recommend.  The list of significant bugs is massive, and to date there's only been one patch that addressed a small list of things.  To give you an example of a major bug present from day 1 with no timeline for a fix: One "day" is 2-3 days - you'll get a "daily" quest every 2-3 days, and have your "daily" limit on earning gold (400g) reset every 2-3 days.  6 cards cost 150g, a win gives 20g, and there are 480 cards... this makes earning cards agonizingly slow.\n\n*** The Good ***\n- Free to play: In game currency is earned at a fair pace, and, unlike Hearthstone, you will unlock all cards in a set number of booster packs (once you have the maximum number of a given card in your collection, that card will no longer appear in your packs).\n\n- Noob friendly: The tutorials are simple, modular, and reward large amounts of gold. They do a good job of teaching the basic rules of the game. The overall power level of cards is low by MTG standards, and there are strict limits on how many powerful cards can go in a deck, which puts people with small collections on a somewhat even footing vs people with large collections.\n\n-Persistant client: This game will continue to grow in terms of features and card sets. While you'd think this is standard for a video game, it is certainly a new and welcome concept for the DotP series.\n\n-It's MTG: The artwork is beautiful and the cards are well designed. MTG is the king of card games for a reason.\n\n-Interface: Although I still question a lot of the design choices (why is the perspective not top-down so that we can easily read the cards? Why are the enemy's cards upside down from my perspective? Why is there no history bar like in Hearthstone so I can review a confusing play the opponent made? Why do the in game decision pop ups completely obscure the playing field, which you need to see in order to make an informed choice?) the interface is undeniably cleaner and snappier than DotP 2014s. The auto targetting system is also quite good, almost always recommending the correct play\n\n*** The Bad ***\n\n-No chat: In what little promotion that they did do for this game, Wizards focussed on the fact that they brought back the much loved 2v2 mode, 2HG. What they didn't tell you is that there is no chat in this game whatsoever, making playing with other people lose all of its social value. Worse, it's super frustrating to be playing with a teammate in what boils down to a strategy/puzzle game, but not be able to coordinate strategy or puzzle solutions with that person. Fire the person who made this design decision - it wrecks the game in the short term, and without a community, your game will not last in the long term.\n\n-Atrocious launch: No communication from devs about release date, server instability repeatedly causing progress to be lost, frequent periods of extended, unexpected downtime. The number of bugs I've discovered is what I'd expect from a game's beta, not the full release. For example, the cutscenes are silent - no music, voice acting, or SFX - which is awkward and embarassing. If I paid money for this I'd be furious.\n\n-Stupidity: Offline progress in campaign and tutorials cannot be saved - you can't farm these for gold, so why require server connection? No cross platform support - if I want to play on my iPad, I need to start a new collection from scratch for iOS. No game lobbies means that you can't play against your friends in 2v2 mode. 2v2 mode does not award gold. 2v2 mode, the best part of the previous games, is not fun without chat. The 1v1 ranked queue often fails, requiring you to press buttons to requeue - I should be automatically requeued if matchmaking fails. It often takes FOREVER to get a 1v1 match because your first 10 matches fail to load.\n\n- AI: The AI makes really really really bad mistakes. I suspect that it is worse than the previous DotP games. For example. it often attacks with all of its creatures, even if it cannot win and will lose next turn by doing so. It feels as though I only lose to the AI because I had a bad draw or because its deck is made from stronger cards than I have access to.\n\n-Campaign: Overall, I enjoyed the campaign. Unfortunately, you can't create or edit a deck for the missions, so whether you win or lose is very much luck of the draw - this is frustrating and unfun. I get that they wanted to give you a feeling of starting from a weakling and becoming all powerful, but the hilariously bad cards in the early decks just get in the way of the fun. I think that next time we should be able to craft our own decks from a restricted pool for each mission.\n\n-Long wishlist: Once the devs fix their servers, fix the bugs, and fix the stupidity outlined above, they need to add chat and lobbies back. Then we need some kind of sealed format (every f2p card game has sealed) and tournament support. Then I would like to see fun modes like Commander, Archenemy, Emperor, and Planechase.","August 5, 2015","false","186.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The textures worked fine throughout the tutorial stages but as soon as I got to a level where there was not one, background under the cards became gridded and grey and would flicker every time the mouse would move. I adjusted the graphics as much as the game would allow, which was much. It has an option to turn graphics from low to high and change resolution, but there were no ther graphics options.

I assume the original purpose was to help beginners, but it actually just blows. There is no flexibility, no way to customize it if you see a balance issue with it as far as lands or some other abitrary limits. That will never be fixed. I say this because actual bug fixes are so slow, that there is no way in gods name they would actually change their jenky little formulas.

Rewards works... well sometimes but not completely and there is a limit but you can't know when.

(No pay-to-win but patience is required)\n- Smooth game flow, animations, and sound effects. (a bit tight on the "instant" side)\n- I like that the story is intertwined with the game, even if it is a short storyline it give cards flavor text more meaning.

Good luck navigating the maze that is your card collection, and don't use the "Deck Wizard". You see, the Deck Dictator actually forbids you from making any deviations from its suggested cards, even when you've finished the deck and want to make some changes to it. It's good only for learning how many lands you should put in a deck.\n\nStory Mode? As confusing and disconnected as the whole affair was, what irked me the most was the true source of the bosses' difficulty; your own deck. Not only are there many bosses whose decks are built perfectly for countering yours (Not the final bosses of the campaigns, mind you; you'll have more trouble with some random hermit witch than with a council of ancient demons), you cannot make the slightest adjustment to the premade deck given to you to respond, even though half the strategy of these games is supposed to be building and adjusting a good deck.\n\nThe UI? It apparently hates people who like to bluff or change their minds, considering the moment you pick up a creature or untargeted spell, you can't put it back in your hand; it'll be played once you let go no matter where the cursor is and you can't go back on it.\n\nThe servers?

Good luck navigating the maze that is your card collection, and don't use the "Deck Wizard". You see, the Deck Dictator actually forbids you from making any deviations from its suggested cards, even when you've finished the deck and want to make some changes to it. It's good only for learning how many lands you should put in a deck.\n\nStory Mode? As confusing and disconnected as the whole affair was, what irked me the most was the true source of the bosses' difficulty; your own deck. Not only are there many bosses whose decks are built perfectly for countering yours (Not the final bosses of the campaigns, mind you; you'll have more trouble with some random hermit witch than with a council of ancient demons), you cannot make the slightest adjustment to the premade deck given to you to respond, even though half the strategy of these games is supposed to be building and adjusting a good deck.\n\nThe UI? It apparently hates people who like to bluff or change their minds, considering the moment you pick up a creature or untargeted spell, you can't put it back in your hand; it'll be played once you let go no matter where the cursor is and you can't go back on it.\n\nThe servers? Well, want to play sometime during the afternoon? Maybe late morning? Impossible!\n\n\n\nYou might like this game if you play Magic and want to do it on the PC. Do remember that I said "might", though.","August 5, 2015","false","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My first impression of the game was that it looked great, very catchy to the eye, so I decided to give it a try. I am not a Magic the Gathering player, so the tutorial was really detailed and fun in my opinion. I got hooked... I played it for a while, grinded a little for coins, got some nice cards eventually, and made a decent white-green elf deck. Sounds great right? Well it was for some time, but eventually some serious flaws with game became obvious to me.\n\nFirst of all, grinding for coins kills a lot of the potential this game could have. Each victory against another player only rewards you 20 coins from the 150 required to buy just 1 booster pack, and each booster pack only gives you six cards (mostly common or boring rare cards unless you are very lucky). When you star playing the game, you get gold from tutorial quests and story mode. There are 5 campaigns on story mode with 5 missions each, and if you complete one the game rewards you with 150 gold (a booster). This is good and all, but you can complete all of this in a single all nighter. Which brings me to the last way in which players can earn gold in-game: Daily and weekly quests which can give you 20-40 coins depending on their difficulty and your luck.\n\nYes, you can buy coins and not grind  at all, but I am adamant against  it at the momment,I don't know if want to be playing this in the future yet.  Months from now I might completely forget about it, so why spend money on a game that was just released and I am not so convinced about its play value yet? So I played and tested it out a little to see if it is worthy of the time and money I usually spend on games that I really love to play. My conclusion on this matter was: No, or perhaps not yet. Stainless games and wizard of the coast need to improve 3 fatal flaws in order for me to recommend this game:\n\n1) Most quests I mentioned before can only be completed with decks created through the deck wizard feature. For those of you who do not know anything about this game yet, you can create your decks in two manners: Full Deck Builder, a beautifully crafted feature that allows you to freely configure your deck while you can sort and filter your card collection, and Deck Wizard, a godamn-awful-restricting feature that I can't ever imagine wanting to use it! So why make it so that you require to use this feature in order to complete the archetype decks quests? I cannot complete quests with my carefully crafted green and white deck, I have to use the green and white deck recommended by the awful deck wizard feature. This wouldn't be so horrible if there werent so many archetype quests, but I got three of them in a row (and remember you only get 1 daily). You can still complete these quests if you play against the easy AI, but it is just awful to create a deck to use twice for a quest and disregarding it afterwards.\n\n2) The game needs to be more rewarding and varied, it is awful to have to win 8 battles (sometimes against people who have paid real money to buy cards which is okay but admitedly harder) to buy a single pack which will likely have cards that you won't use (either because you don't like them or they simply don't synergize with the cards you already have). Yeah, the quests help, but after you complete all campaigns and tutorials it all feels so slow... Two Headed Dragon, an awesome game mode which let players go on 2 vs 2 matches doesn't give you anything when you win... It is the only alternate game mode and it is not rewarding to play it, fun at times, but doesn't help me improve my collection at all.\n\n3) The bugs and glitches... I know that it is new a game and that they already admitted on their twitter page that they are still working on these, but the game gets stuck from time to time. Yes, this third point is understandable in my opinion, they didn't have a beta testing as far as I know, but it is an issue. I had games as good as won when for some reason it doesn't let me play my cards and gets stuck, this glitch happened twice and has made me concede games when I am winning (The other opponent had 2 of health and no monsters at the beginning of my turn ugh). Also, game sometimes gets stuck on the loading screen, I had to restart my laptop once, As I said, it is a new game so I try to be patient; nonetheless, it is still a flaw that needs to be pointed out  until it is solved.\n\nAs it is, this game is just a tutorial for new players and a clever commercial for the physical and the online complete version of this trading card game. Not rewarding enough and slow paced at times. It feels like the more you play it, the less enjoyable it is. They need to do something drastical if they mean to flip that curve.","August 10, 2015","false","105.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It may be useful for teaching someone the basics of Magic, but for veterans it's probably not worth the download time.\n\nDefault settings will pick the damage distribution for you when you block with multiple creatures, and won't let you use instants and abilities after blockers are assigned (but before damage is dealt). It's horrible, especially in story mode decks that absolutely require doing this to play effectively (and the AI does it even if you can't).\n\nThis might be because of the (on by default) Auto Resolution setting, which is described as "Automatically resolve effects of many spells and abilities". I guess combat damage is a "spell or ability" now.\n\nThe short countdown timer on phases is terrible. You'll either be forced to wait around on phases you can't do anything on, or you'll be suddenly shoved off to the next phase because you didn't mash the "pause timer" button in the 5 seconds or so from when the phase started. Trying to squeeze in an instant or ability in the opponent's End Phase? Nope, it's your main phase now! Stop looking at your cards for so long, sheesh.\n\nGameplay issues aside, the only way to grow your collection beyond the starter set is through random boosters (there's just one kind of booster in the entire game; the "Store" just lets you buy 1 pack, 2 packs, 4 packs, etc...) and you can't really make a decent deck in most of the deck wizard archetypes with the starting collection they give you.\n\nIt can be fun to dabble in the Story mode for solo play with prebuilt decks (when the terrible phase progression system doesn't cost you the match), but for actual deckbuilding and multiplayer, just pick up Magic The Gathering Online. It's not pretty and it's a little less streamlined, but it's a faithful reproduction of every aspect of the physical card game and gives you full control over your play. You can buy cards from WotC's shop in all the same packs/decks as the physical editions, or just trade / buy individually from resellers if you know the excact cards you want, build decks in Standard, Extended, or any other format, play normally, 2 headed giant, etc, participate in the same sorts of events/tournaments as physical MTG, literally everything except single-player against AI. It even has a free trial mode so you can take the UI for a spin with a prebuilt deck.","October 10, 2015","false","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The tell short stories about the popular planeswalkers gradually evolving their decks. While this is a step back from previous duels games it's still nice to play. The short tutorial turns are a nice way of introducing basic mechanics to new players. Overall the gameplay hasn't changed much since the previous installement and is pretty well polished. It's fast and smooth once you get used to some gimmicks. The introduction of unlimited deckbuilding brings us closer to magic proper although the card pool feels rather small, but that will change with time.\n\nSo why the negative review? Well:\n* The interface is basically designed for tablets. The player has to scroll through rows of cards, icons, etc with 'swiping' moves to do anything. It's tedious and irritating and does not suit mouse controls.\n* The multiplayer is kinda meh, no interactions (ways to congratulate or taunt your oponent) makes the experience dull. To top it off there seems to be no penalty for idling which is often exploited by oponents. Also when an oponent ragequits the AI steps in and you still have to finish the game.\n* Some campaign missions basically require you to restart until you get a decent hand because they're practically unbeatable otherwise. Not a big pain, but still looks like a balancing issue.\n* But the worst offender is the deckbuilder. No way to search your freaking library in any meaningfull way! What the hell? It's so frustrating to build a deck when all you get are color and cost filters. If you want to find anything you have to scroll through rows of cards with 'swiping' moves. There's also no way to see your whole deck at once which is ♥♥♥♥ if youre trying to build anything with some sort of synergy. It looks like no thought was put into designing any of it which is inexcusable in a pc game, and frankly a game where deckbuilding is the most fun. 0/10\n\nTo sum it up, the game shows potential but until someone steps in and fixins the UI and multiplayer issues you're better off playing hearthstone.","August 6, 2015","false","8.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've looked forward to what the developer could do with the next iteration.\n\nWell, this developer has done a poor job. As others have mentioned the series has regressed, losing features. The series is obviously mimicking Hearthstone but doing a bad job of it.\n\nMy main gripes:\n\n15g per win (20g vs online opponent) and 150g to buy a booster pack of only 6 cards. No discount for buying packs in bulk. Plus a weak card pool (not just the rares, but even more importantly the commons and uncommons) for every archetype (aggro, midrange, control, ramp, combo). This means a long and rather uninteresting grind.\n\nA frustrating beginner experience because of the above. Its not much fun to use a very limited, weak, and uninteresting pool of cards against more interesting decks played by the AI.\n\nThe AI has not improved in this series for over four years. It doesn't seem to have been worked on.\n\nRemoved different gameplay modes and challenges from the campaign.\n\nCan't get gold from 2 headed giant games? So you put in a feature and penalize players who enjoy that feature. Again, these players already have to slowly grind for gold. How does that make sense?\n\nCan't save account/game data across platforms. Their excuse for this was lame. Hearthstone can do it and its been out for a while. Who cares if its out on iPhone, iPad, Steam, and console if you have to create an account for each one? Discourages players from long term play and investing $$ in the game for gold and packs. This is a major, major flaw.\n\nCan play a 30-40 minute game against an online opponent, right before winning the opp quits/disconnects and you lose connection to the game and will not gain any gold for the win. This just happened to me. The payout is bad enough without this disconnects.\n\nSolutions:\n\nIncrease the amount of gold per win to 25g.\n\nQuests should give at least 75g each. These massive worldwide coop quests should be even more. A worldwide quest today has a 40g reward. Not even 1/3 of a pack.\n\nIncrease booster packs to AT LEAST 8 cards  per pack, but preferably 9-10.\n\nDo whatever coding you have to do to make it cross platform compatible.\n\nHire a new developer.\n\nGive free packs to all customers for all the grief with the servers and all these letdowns. This costs you no money but makes the customer base feel listened to and happy. Happy and loyal customers is a good thing.","August 6, 2015","false","249.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I play casual Magic in real life very often, I am familiar with all the rules to a high degree and have played approximately 1000 online matches of the Duels of The Planeswalker games in years past.\n\nAlthough it had some weird drawbacks--namely not being able to remove any unlocked cards from your deck--the first iteration of this game was awesome.  It got me back into the game: here was something that was easy to play, had a good mix of different card and deck types, and was just a really streamlined, accessible way to play casual M:tG games without having to get a group together and worry about deck balance.\n\nThe next two (or three, I forget how many now) were similarly excellent.  Rudimentary deck editing allowed seasoned players much greater control over how they played, and was a much more managable way for new players to learn the ins and outs of what makes or breaks a deck.\n\nMagic 2015 and this new Duels have just taken huge strides backwards.  Forcing players to build their own decks without actually providing any information on why and how the old archetypes were constructed makes the gap between pros and newbs that much wider, and makes for a much more narrow metagame than previous years.  Add in the lack of extra modes, the inability to skip a patronizingly hand-holding tutorial for advanced players, and a cap on how much you can progress in the game ON YOUR OWN TIME to further encourage spending extra money on the game, and in my opinion you have the worst game Stainless has put out yet.\n\nObviously I haven't played it very much, and I may go back and slog through the intros to sink my teeth in a little deeper, but this game is exactly what no one was asking for.\n\n"The ones who just don't get it are the ones who scream the loudest."  I've heard WotC say players have been clamoring for open-ended deck editing for years, so that's why these last two have looked like the did, but look what happened:  the worst sales and reviews of the series for two years straight.\n\nWotC, Chris, whoever reads this, take note:  GIVE US BACK DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS.  Your company already offers platforms that meet the needs of people who want open-ended deck editing and microtransactions, what about those of us who, for three years in a row, happily paid $20US for a main game and also several expansions that allowed casual players a fair and streamlined platform for playing M:tG?\n\nTL;DR - It's free so you might as well get it, and there's certainly fun to be had, but by comparison DotP:2014 is the cream of the crop, offering 21 different 100 card decks, 2HG and several other modes, and, if you buy it on Steam, unlimited modification options.","August 6, 2015","false","18.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I put 7 hours into it, I've unlocked 5 or 6 boosters and I'm only now realizing how little this game actually has to it. It's laggy, there are around 50 cards for each color(including the dual color cards) and the match making is a joke.\n\nWhoever makes this game, WotC/Stainless/whoever just f/n charge for the game because I'm really tired of F2P terrible games getting released.","August 5, 2015","false","7.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The tell short stories about the popular planeswalkers gradually evolving their decks. While this is a step back from previous duels games it's still nice to play. The short tutorial turns are a nice way of introducing basic mechanics to new players. Overall the gameplay hasn't changed much since the previous installement and is pretty well polished. It's fast and smooth once you get used to some gimmicks. The introduction of unlimited deckbuilding brings us closer to magic proper although the card pool feels rather small, but that will change with time.\n\nSo why the negative review? Well:\n* The interface is basically designed for tablets. The player has to scroll through rows of cards, icons, etc with 'swiping' moves to do anything. It's tedious and irritating and does not suit mouse controls.\n* The multiplayer is kinda meh, no interactions (ways to congratulate or taunt your oponent) makes the experience dull. To top it off there seems to be no penalty for idling which is often exploited by oponents. Also when an oponent ragequits the AI steps in and you still have to finish the game.\n* Some campaign missions basically require you to restart until you get a decent hand because they're practically unbeatable otherwise. Not a big pain, but still looks like a balancing issue.\n* But the worst offender is the deckbuilder. No way to search your freaking library in any meaningfull way! What the hell? It's so frustrating to build a deck when all you get are color and cost filters. If you want to find anything you have to scroll through rows of cards with 'swiping' moves. There's also no way to see your whole deck at once which is ♥♥♥♥ if youre trying to build anything with some sort of synergy. It looks like no thought was put into designing any of it which is inexcusable in a pc game, and frankly a game where deckbuilding is the most fun. 0/10\n\nTo sum it up, the game shows potential but until someone steps in and fixins the UI and multiplayer issues you're better off playing hearthstone.","August 6, 2015","false","8.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've looked forward to what the developer could do with the next iteration.\n\nWell, this developer has done a poor job. As others have mentioned the series has regressed, losing features. The series is obviously mimicking Hearthstone but doing a bad job of it.\n\nMy main gripes:\n\n15g per win (20g vs online opponent) and 150g to buy a booster pack of only 6 cards. No discount for buying packs in bulk. Plus a weak card pool (not just the rares, but even more importantly the commons and uncommons) for every archetype (aggro, midrange, control, ramp, combo). This means a long and rather uninteresting grind.\n\nA frustrating beginner experience because of the above. Its not much fun to use a very limited, weak, and uninteresting pool of cards against more interesting decks played by the AI.\n\nThe AI has not improved in this series for over four years. It doesn't seem to have been worked on.\n\nRemoved different gameplay modes and challenges from the campaign.\n\nCan't get gold from 2 headed giant games? So you put in a feature and penalize players who enjoy that feature. Again, these players already have to slowly grind for gold. How does that make sense?\n\nCan't save account/game data across platforms. Their excuse for this was lame. Hearthstone can do it and its been out for a while. Who cares if its out on iPhone, iPad, Steam, and console if you have to create an account for each one? Discourages players from long term play and investing $$ in the game for gold and packs. This is a major, major flaw.\n\nCan play a 30-40 minute game against an online opponent, right before winning the opp quits/disconnects and you lose connection to the game and will not gain any gold for the win. This just happened to me. The payout is bad enough without this disconnects.\n\nSolutions:\n\nIncrease the amount of gold per win to 25g.\n\nQuests should give at least 75g each. These massive worldwide coop quests should be even more. A worldwide quest today has a 40g reward. Not even 1/3 of a pack.\n\nIncrease booster packs to AT LEAST 8 cards  per pack, but preferably 9-10.\n\nDo whatever coding you have to do to make it cross platform compatible.\n\nHire a new developer.\n\nGive free packs to all customers for all the grief with the servers and all these letdowns. This costs you no money but makes the customer base feel listened to and happy. Happy and loyal customers is a good thing.","August 6, 2015","false","249.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To add insult to injury, the grind is that much more difficult with bad cards.
