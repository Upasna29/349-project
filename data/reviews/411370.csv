"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrValdez/recommended/411370/","MrValdez","MrValdez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrValdez/","394 products in account","I play a lot of fighting games. But if there's one game I will take to a deserted island, it would be Melty Blood. Me and my siblings have been playing this for ~13 years.\n\nOriginally released in December 2002, this is a visual novel that happened to have a fighting game minigame. This was long before BlazBlue introduced the idea to the mainstream. The game's story is a continuation of Tsukihime and (surprisingly), is canon and explains how dead characters returned to life to fight with the small roster.\n\nThe original game was broken. A lot of moves have shield frames (meaning, if this move hits another move, no damage is done but you can cancel to a different move) which lead to anime-esque fights with freeze frames everywhere as players switch moves to try to break through. Also, the post-victory screen will not end until the defeated character is on the ground. Meaning, if you killed your opponent while they're on the air, you can juggle them almost infinitely before the round will officially end (like other airdashers, the longer a combo is, the heavier the opponent becomes).\n\nRegardless, this game has a lot of innovations. Some of them are:\n- This game has 3 buttons and a dedicated shield button (think of it like Street Fighter V Ryu's parry but you can cancel to other moves) - which makes each character easy to play.\n- Melty Blood has no chip death making to exciting matches.\n- Characters can use their meter to gain a new gauge (called HEAT) that slowly goes down. During this time, the character regenerates life AND stops the clock. This makes the timer an important resource to manage. It is common for a player to stop the clock when its almost over and run away (or rushdown) to maintain the lead.\n- Super moves on a successful parry during HEAT.\n\nLater expansions in the series include Re-ACT (PC), ReACT Final Tuned (PC), Act Cadenza (Arcade), Act Cadenza Ver.B (PS2), Act Cadenza Ver.B (PC), Actress Again (PC), Actress Again Current Code (PC). ...if you think Street Fighter's naming convention is crazy, French Bread has taken it to the extreme.\n\nThe game released on Steam will have the following features:\n- More characters! There are now 31 characters.\n- Each character have 3 different fighting style which each plays completely different. Effectively, this game has 31 multiply by 3 characters\n- Balance\n- Updated story (very important for those who wanted more Tsukihime)\n\nThis game is so popular that it was referenced in the Type-Moon fan-service OVA, Carnival Phantasm.\n\nThe Melty Blood fighting community love this game so much, that we have no problem playing the grand finals at a parking lot or airport lounge. This is how dedicated we are to this game.\n\nIf you haven't played this gem and you love fighting games, give Melty Blood a shot. Who knows? Maybe you'll be airdashing with the rest of us for the next 13 years.","April 19","true","20.8"," 191 of 209 people (91%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","91","191","209","17","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MechaGS/recommended/411370/","MechaGS","MechaGS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MechaGS/","566 products in account","For a long time, Melty Blood sat as a rare gem in someone’s physical copy of Carnival Phantasm. It was a locked-away title that only by means not so moral became extremely popular and for very good reason.\n\nFast forward six years and here we are. Arc SystemWorks have brought it to Steam and I for one am happy that they have done so. We can now own a wonderful gem at a fraction of the cost it would have to buy that blu-ray set long ago.\n\nMelty Blood is the true definition of air dasher. It’s a fast-paced, gorgeous fighting game that through its character’s and setting; oozes charm at every turn. The game is a true cult-classic and has a very large following. It’s not hard to see why either.\n\nWith this build, we have the last arcade version on Steam. With a newly improved lobby system for those who want to get their netplay on (Rollback net-code confirmed as coming later) and the usual suite of features such as Arcade mode and Training; there’s plenty to do in the game.\n\nFor those who have played 2D sprited fighters before, you’ll be amazed by the sprite count each character has and how fluid the action is from start to finish. Every move has been meticulously crafted and every little nuance drawn to perfection. Its one hell of a sight in motion, you really need to see it for yourself.\n\nThe soundtrack is also absolutely fantastic. Hell, if I could buy it right now on here I would. It’s in my personal top five fighting game soundtracks of all time and for very good reason. Raito has worked so hard on this soundtrack and it shines through. Ryougi Shiki’s theme is my favourite track in the collection.\n\nThere are a few small problems with the game. As mentioned the net-code is being updated in due time but right now some people are having serious issues with it. The game doesn’t remember your previous character / moon selections so you constantly need to get that right too. (as there’s no way back after selection)\n\nBarring these minor issues, the game stand’s on its own as one of the greatest fighting game titles ever to grace Steam. I urge people to show love to this title and help it grow into something wonderful.\n\nRemember, right now this game is really cheap with its 20% off and even when it’s not 20% off it’s still a steal considering the price of a physical copy.\n\nI’ll be pushing this game for a long time and I feel I’ve got way more than my money’s worth out of it already. Here’s to more hologram summer!\n\nTL;DR: Buy it, support it, new net-code is coming soon, patches have already begun. Let’s play together sometime!","April 22","true","31.9"," 91 of 98 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","91","98","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajshell1/recommended/411370/","ajshell1","ajshell1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajshell1/","1440 products in account","Don't be fooled by my small playtime. I've actually played this game quite a bit before it's official english relase.\n\nI have to say, this is one of the best fighting games I've ever played. It takes characters from the Tsukihime visual novel (THERE IS NO TSUKIHIME ANIME), as well as one character from Kara No Kyoukai, and puts them in a fighting game. Since I had already played Tsukihime, I am definitely a bit biased, as I am already quite invested in these characters. But despite that. I'm willing to reccomend it as a very good fighting game.\n\nHere are some questions that you may have for the game.\nQ: How does this differ from the Japanese release of MBAACC wtih Mirror Moon's english patch?\nA: There are several improvements. Firstly, Mirror Moon was not able to finish the translations of some of the character's story arcade modes. This includes Nanaya Shiki, Roa, and a few others. In addition, this version offers controller configuration and keyboard configuration within the game's option menu. In the original release of the game, keyboard configuration was done in a separate, non-translated .exe. Also, pressing the escape key won't immediately cause the game to exit, like it does in the orignal. This version also lists the combos on the side panels.\n\nQ: The store page says that this is the final episode of a series. Do I need to play the previous episodes?\nA: That depends. If you only interested in the fighting part of this fighting game, you only need this game, as it is superior to all previous versions in term of fighting mechanics. However, playing at least the first game in the series (Melty Blood) is essential to understanding the storyline of this game, and anyone who hasn't played Tsukihime will be COMPLETELY lost. However, the fighting mechanics in the original Melty Blood are a bit....crap in comparison to this game. In addition, the original Melty Blood featured a story-to-combat ratio of at least 10:1, maybe as high as 30:1.\n\nQ: How's the translation?\nA: I haven't played the arcade mode for very long, but what I've seen appears to be good enough. I'll update this later after I've seen more. I might even upload some screenshot comparisons if i can be bothered.\n\nQ: I don't know anything about Tsukihime. However, I like Guitly Gear and BlazBlue. Will I like this?\nA: Yes. MBAACC uses the three-button attack sytem of Guilty Gear and BlazBlue, so any player of these games should feel right at home in this one. Heck, I'd argue that this games is BETTER than Guilty Gear XX and BlazBlue Calamity Trigger. However, as I mentioned previously, I may be a bit biased.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to fighting game fans and fans of Type-Moon. I also recommend this to people who already "own" a copy of the Japanese version.\n\nThis review is dedicated to Miyu Matsuki, the voice actor of Hisui who is sadly no longer with us.","April 19","true","8.7"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","24","27","3","4"

My buddy and I were playing hours of Street Fighter 3: Third Strike, when he suddenly turned to me and asked me if I wanted to try something new. I was struck with confusion, Third Strike was OUR thing, it’s what our friendship was built on and here he is wanting to try something new? Reluctantly I agreed and then asked what was it, he then replied, “Melty Blood”. I was stunned, but who wouldn’t be stunned with a awesome name like that? We then spent hours with this newly discovered anime fighter and branded ourselves rebels because we were playing this hot new Japanese exclusive outside of the country. However, the allure began to fade, my friend lost interest, and I didn’t have a powerful enough computer at the time to run it. I honestly thought that day woud be the last time that I would ever talk about Melty Blood — that is until right now.\n\nYou probably don’t know this, but this game took ages to make it to the states. So buckle up, because here comes a quick history lesson. Melty Blood started its days as an indie fighting game jointly developed by Type-Moon and French Bread back in 2002. The PC version continued to receive some updates along the way, then around 2005, Ecole Software steps forward and develops Melty Blood ports for the arcade and PlayStation 2 and the series began to slowly stray away from its PC roots. It wouldn’t be until 2011 when Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code would finally make its way back to the PC. Five years later, thanks to Arc System Works, we finally have an official release here in the States.\n\nAnd what do you get after such a long wait? You get an impressive soundtrack, plenty of stages to choose from, 31 characters, and several playable game modes that you’d expect to see in your everyday fighter. First, there’s an arcade mode where the player fights CPU opponents across nine stages. The story takes place after the events of the original Melty Blood and each character plays a role in the new chapter entitled Hologram Summer Again. Fair warning, you’ll be completely lost if you’ve never played Tsukihime, the visual novel which Melty Blood is based from. So a mode that recounts the events up until Actress Again would have been a nice addition. Then, there’s the versus and training mode, which both are pretty standard by conventional fighting game standards. And finally, there is the network mode and to be honest, during my research I found it a bit difficult to find matches in my region. In the end, I had to expand my search range, which helped me find matches, but the increased latency totally kills the swift back and forth action.\n\nThis game encompasses rapid decisions through a four button system. The A, B, and C buttons correspond to weak, medium, and heavy respectively. While the D button functions as a shield or parry of sorts. Each character utilizes a near identical move-set with similar motions that increase the ease of learning a new character. So if you know how to do a quarter circle forward or back motion, then you can probably operate the majority of the characters in the cast. Along with the special moves, the cast has access to various types of advanced states and super moves that are totally dependent on the status of their magic circuit or in simplified terms — the super meter. When the player has at least 100% magic circuit, they can press the A, B, and C buttons simultaneously to activate Heat Mode. In this state the player can regenerate life and can also use an advanced super move known as Arc-Drives. But in Melty Blood, you can’t just sit on meter and wait too long for the right opportunity to use it. When it comes to meter usage, Melty Blood does something unique that I haven’t experienced in other fighters — once the meter reaches its maximum point, it automatically enters into Max Mode and the meter starts depleting rapidly. This forces the player to go on an all-out offensive and utilize the meter that they’ve built up before it’s gone. During Max Mode the player can still use Arc-Drives, enter an advanced Heat Mode called Blood Heat Mode for access to the flashy Last-Arc countering move, and use the Circuit Spark mechanic — which is just a type of defensive burst maneuver. But Circuit Spark can only be used with the crescent and half-moon styles.\n\nThese moon styles I speak of were introduced in Actress Again and, in my opinion, they add a layer of complexity to the game. If you’ve played Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Capcom vs. SNK 2, then moon styles could be best compared to -ISMs or the Groove system. Each moon style alters the game’s mechanics to better suit the player’s style. However, not only do they change the mechanics, they also alter a character’s attacks, specials, and at times, their movement. The Crescent Moon style caters towards players that desire to strike a balance between speed, power, and combos. While the Half Moon style focuses on combos in place of power, but the power still exists through advanced combos. Then there is the Full Moon style which limits combos in exchange for sheer power. As I mentioned earlier, these styles can alter the mechanics quite a bit. For instance, the crescent and half-moon styles have the ability to use reverse beat — a mechanic that allows the player to go back in a string of normal moves. Which just means that you can press the weak, medium, and heavy buttons in succession, then revert back to the weak button for added combo possibilities or return to a normal with fast recovery. While the full moon style does not have this mechanic, its play style will feel familiar to players accustomed to the chaining mechanics of fighters like Skullgirls, Darkstalkers, or Guilty Gear.\n\nWith that being said, Melty Blood really began to grow on me while I was writing the column. It’s a good anime fighter that is easy to learn with cool mechanics, but it definitely has flaws that plague recent fighting game re-releases. The number of modes are lacking, network mode definitely needs work, and at least half of the playable characters are clone or joke characters. This game has a lot of mechanics with different features and details, so I found it to be sad that they only get minimal descriptions on the character select screen. Sure, there are plenty of resources online, but a tutorial mode or at least a digital manual would have been a nice addition to help new players. I’m happy that we finally have an official release of Melty Blood, but I can only recommend this game those players who enjoy experiencing different fighting games, who’re familiar with the game’s story — or in the case of network mode — have other friends who’re interested in the game, because the online community is small. In all honesty, I think Melty Blood’s arrival to the states might have been a little too late.","May 24","true","23.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Even with that, I am still a scrubby nooblet. This game is quite deep, and takes a lot to master, but it is also fairly accessable at a base level, only having 3 buttons and straight forward chains.\n\n+ Amazing balance and depth\n+ Dedicated community that has stuck around and will still continue to stick around\n+ Fast gameplay that rewards aggression\n+ While not a HD remake, they have smoothed out the sprites and touched up the backgrounds, several with very nice ambient effects\n+ Over 90 characters due to the Moon system (31 characters with 3 moon styles = 93 possible playable characters)\n+ Great characters — albeit, on average less outrageous than most others\n+ Satsuki Yumizuka\n\n- The game does not have a challenge/trial system, which means that you have to look up and figure things out entirely from third party sources, which presents a barrier to entry\n- As mentioned by others, there are largely speaking only two sorts of players right now: the incredibly new, and the incredibly experienced. The experience gradient will even out over time\n- As of release, the netplay is experiencing issues, but I am confident that it will be fixed relatively quickly—Arc System Works games generally have stellar netplay\n- Some people might experience some lag on some of the revamped stages, such as the cherry blossom stage that now has actual cherry blossoms falling (it's pretty neat). I've heard there's an option to turn off sprite smoothing, but I don't know if it also changes the stages—I'm inclined to believe it does, but even if it doesn't, you can just avoid the problem stages\n\nThis is honestly the best-designed fighting game I've ever had the joy to play, and you should certainly give it a shot if you're considering.","April 19","true","4.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Even while it has no simplified controlling like Blazblue does with Stylish mode, it is still a good choice for anyone giving it a try, for learning how to play can be very rewarding once you manage to learn how to do combos with someone, which are oftentimes a variation of one or two chain leading up from one to the other. While this may make MB somewhat beginner friendly among other games, it'd be a mistake to say that is all to it, since just like how it can be easy to pick up, it also takes time to truly master or main as referred in inside terms those you pick, so be prepared for that.\n\nSince only the latest release of the series made it to Steam, allow me to briefly recount the events leading up to the present.\nMisaki City and within Tohno Shiki is over the days that took place in Tsukihime, on the surface suggesting that it should bring relative peace to the once dangerous streets, but to his surprise it was not so as another vampire chose the area as the next place for the massacre it's done for many centuries. With the help of a lone alchemist, Sion Eltnam Atlasia as well as many others he's managed to beat him before it could happen, but since it had no real body, its spirit so to speak was left behind, preparing for the time when he can return. As the incident repeated itself many times influencing more and more people, they soon joined the fray and became members of the factions that fought to maintain order, driven not only by a sense of mission, but also personal desire. Thus, the next hologram summer begins.\n\nWhat first come to sight is the sadly outdated graphics that's been mostly inherited from the first game that was still a visual novel with fighting game elements released as far back in as 2002, where it was still plenty acceptable, but in today's HD resolutions and special effect packed games, it's undeniably lacking in quality. The stages where the fights take place are in fairly low res with much less detail unlike the better know BB, which is even more pronounced with the character sprites themselves. Due to the very low resolution they were made in hailing back to the glorious days of DOS long gone by, every sprite is pixelated to the point where you can count the particles that make one up, though it should also be known that this game has never tried to focus on graphics and made the gameplay better to make up for it.\n\nUnlike the previous installments which had a mixture of various moves tailored for every member of the cast, this one has three different sets called styles in the shape of the moon, with crescent being the one resembling the old controls, full moon being the choice of power oriented and half moon for the quick and aggressive attackers at the cost of no special moves. The second is distinct in not being able to activate heat or circuit spark (emergency break) on demand, meaning you have to fully charged to meter before doing either, relying more on strategies made beforehand and advanced understanding of every character than split-second decisions. The last one on the other hand is special because it's a little similar to Stylish in the way of being assisted by the game to a limited degree in trigger moves without additional order, but the drawback is should you get locked down, it's likely over. Therefore caution is advised.\n\nAnother of the very much liked features it has is the soundtrack with songs all over Melty Blood, playing a diverse and enjoyable collection that compliments to stages being shown, albeit with many of them pretty much being remixes that is fine for one or two times, but can be disappointing for the nth time. Nonetheless it is still a very nice pack as along with the original tracks there are several additional ones that came with the new arenas, and while the some of them are arguably not as engaging, listening to them is very much fun. It should be noted that unlike another famous game, there's no option to choose the stage and BGM separately, so if there's a particular song one likes, they can only take that with the arena it plays in.\n\nHaving an inbuilt netplay client also helped making it popular though it has mostly been agreed upon that it's not very stable and userfriendly, as due to the coding it's prone to heavy lags and connection problems, making it fairly difficult to use the multiplayer function to anyone who isn't located closely to the host. This problem comes from the code based on a delay number, and was also very sensitive to minute changes in latency, as the developers didn't plan for release outside of Japan. A fix is being developed though by the creator of the tool that provided rollback capability to the original version, and is strongly suggested to be incorporated at some time, which would significantly improve quality for all those who like to fight not just AI.\n\nEnglish translated Japanese games tend to have issues with the level of translation too with MB being an unusually puzzling one, having mistakes ranging from simple typos that could be found anywhere to blatantly obvious and more shockingly seemingly deliberate mistypes coming from not romanizing names as they should be. Better yet, they are inconsistent even with themselves since their spelling follows different ways even when it comes to a single character, presenting us with such gems as Yumiduka Satsuki or Powdered Ciel. It is certainly undeniable that here is not the only case where similar surprises might await the unwary, but few do it so openly when pretty much every existing translation that mentions them in a different way. Sometimes, the language barrier just turns into AT Fields.\n\nWhile this game is certainly old though and cannot quite compete with many of the other games in the genre Melty Blood Actress Again is still a solid choice for those who like nice gameplay with one of the most expansive universes out there, giving the chance for all sorts of encounters that make such a game truly fun. If one wants shinier graphics which is certainly not an unreasonable request as much as good fights, then I'd kindly redirect them to any of ASW's other releases that strikes their fancy, for they are also nice in their own right. But for those who love MB for what it is, there's no reason to refuse playing it other than being stomped into the pavement by someone much more experienced, so do give it a try should you get the chance.","May 15","true","13.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

It's an amazing fighter mechanically, and I've been a huge fan of the Type-Moon setting for years.\n\nBut as of right now, about three days after release, this version of the game is bad. Not "PSP port of Fate/Unlimited Codes" bad, where it was a stripped down port, so if you just want to play against other people in the same room it's perfectly fine. Identical to the last PC version that was released.\n\nBut the netcode is awful. When the connection's particularly bad, it can make hit-confirms or any sort of reaction-based play completely impossible. Which unfortunately pretty much means Ranked is a crapshoot.\n\nAnd on top of that, the translation of the Arcade mode is pretty bad. It's littered with typos, names and terms are translated rather inconsistently (Wallachia/Warachia, for example, as well as the regular use of honorifics) and a lot of subtleties aren't conveyed at all for people unfamiliar with the original visual novel (no distinction between Shiki and SHIKI, and characters like Akiha, Hisui, and Miyako all refer to Shiki simply by name most of the time). If you're already a fan of Tsukihime, you'll probably be able to notice when this happens and will probably be able to infer the original intent, but players less familiar with but still interested in the story will be left in the dark.\n\nThough I will say it's nice that most of the setting terms were translated in accordance with the terminology most of the English-speaking fanbase uses. In constrast to, say, Fate/Extra, which can be very jarring for existing fans to read when they start using terms like "Legendary Soul" instead of "Heroic Spirit."\n\nIn short, this game is in dire need of some patches to fix the netplay and the scripts. But the underlying game mechanics are as superb as ever.","April 23","false","20.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The usual for projectyles is to pass throght each other, but if they do destroy each other they have a normal hurtbox that can be destroyed with a normal attack.\nThere is a marker for projectyle types of moves, but it is only used to mark what can be reflected.\nBtw, Melty have a lot of "projectyle looking things" that don't reach fullscreen and can't be reflected.\nThis combination make projectyle wars dynamics becomes something very different, and generally end very fast with someone taking a hit/blocking/deciding to maneuver around it or away form it.\n\nAs a feature of the "Actress Again" subseries, we have as a stample feature a "groove system" with 3 styles.\nEach style have their subset of mechanics (like kof 98 or cvs2), but a different moveset too (like mkx).\n\nCrescent Moon is based on the general mechanic of old versions.\nThis means that this groove retains multiple defensive options ("parry", dodge, "alpha counter", "burst", etc) and the moveset is commonly based on the older versions with some new tricks added.\nThe crescent groove usually will have the largest moveset (really hard to predict), but not necessarily the strongest individual moves.\nDue to retaining the meter mechanic from older games, they have the best control of it.\n\nHalf Moon and Full Moon are original takes on mechanic and moveset, and usually leads to more simple and straight foward characters.\n\nHalf Moon can be considered the "speed groove".\nTheir walkspeed an dashes are the same or faster than Crescent Moon versions.\nFor some characters jumps/airdashes startup/landing/travel speed is slightly better too.\nThey have less control over the meter, but gains acess to a better "alpha counter" with it and a sucessfull "parry" triggers a auto-counter that launch in the air.\nAll of them have a sequence of 3 attacks triggered by imputing 5a6aa, that is at the same time a basic combo tool and a pressure tool.\n\nFull Moon can be considered the "power groove".\nTheir walkspeed and dashes are the same or slower than Crescent Moon versions.\nSometimes their dashes will be a little faster, but less controllable than other versions.\nIt's very common for their 2A to be a low, jA to be a overhead and to have better frame advantage and hitbox in normals.\nDifferent from other moons, they can cancel the landing recovery into block even after using a attack in the air.\n\nIt's important to notice that Crescent Moon and Half Moon have a more freeform chain route, while Full Moon have a more rigid one.\nOutside of command normals, Full moon can only follow the "from weak attack to strong", standing Mid to crouching Mid and use a single grounded strong (or standing or crouching) in a chain.\nCrescent Moon and Half Moon can go from crouching to standing regardless of the button, and even go "from strong to attack to weak".\nThis usually will give a more flexible pressure for Crescent and Half moon grooves, with more chances to prolong and reset blockstrings.\nBut the better frame advantge and proprieties of Full Moon normals compensate this.","April 20","true","14.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kr4zfool/recommended/411370/","kr4zfool","расформирование","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kr4zfool/","59 products in account","As a player being torn between recommending and not recommending this game, I ultimately went with recommending this game. There are ups and downs, and I don't mean this towards the core gameplay. That part specifically is sheerly preference. If you want to know if this game is fun, watch reviews, look at tournament footage, pirate first and buy later. I won't get deep into detail about the core game.\n\nMelty is an old game and it has not seen a US release for almost a decade if not already. Melty seeing a steam release is beyond phenomenal, obviously. If you're a hardcore Melty lover, here's your chance to throw your money away in blind support.\n\nNow, this is a very early review. A VERY early review. I have my doubts, but there's a chance that new content or possibly even DLC could exist, but seeing as how dead the game is nowadays, this is highly unlikely. French Bread has moved on to other products. It was a miracle to even get a rank match system, which is one of the ups the steam version has. It also has wide screen which doesn't really do much but show you a portion of the characters' movelist.\n\nHere's some Pros and Cons. Content wise, it's a little disappointing that the only thing that's NEW to this steam version is having an english translation and a matching system. If you look at the console versions of Melty, you'd see that it has a lot more content, such as the boss rush mode, eclipse moon style, secret bosses, and whatever else that I can't think of. I'm actually unsure why the completely removed team battles from Act Cadenza, not to mention. Not even the console version kept it. Maybe it just wouldn't work the the new system, who knows. But oh well.\n\nNow for some additional details. When initially playing the game on ranked, I found a lot of super laggy players who ended up quitting immediately. After messing with the filtering for a bit, I actually got quite a few matches that were really good with the connection filter set to at least 1+. You may want to do 2+, but depending on how slowly you get matches (and the popularity of the game), you may want to put the numbers lower. The netcode ain't perfect, but it's tolerable and I can do decent combos against opponents on the fly. There's also no rollback either. In general, I had a decently fun time fighting new opponents every now and then. At first, my filter was a bit strict and I kept getting only 2 of the same people, but after putting some more leniency on the filters, I got a lot more people, new people everytime, almost. In short, don't choose "ANYONE" for your connection filter, I personally had a bad time with it.\n\nIn closing... if you're a melty fanatic, get this game if you really want to support it. The online and english features gives us english speakers access to the game. It makes the game more accessible and doesn't force us to have to pirate it just to play it without importing or some nonsense. Even without the steam version coming out, there's an entire community out there on a site called meltybread.com who has a few other connections as well, one of them being a Discord channel dedicated to melty banter and matches. Heck, even the fanmade patches and mods have MORE features than the steam version! The CCCaster being a prime example! There are a lot of ways to get consistent matches with people around your skill level WITHOUT the steam version. But obviously, this is NOT about being able to simply being able to play the game. This is exposure and that's what counts. I honestly do not know how far this game will come, now that it's on steam, but to be brutally honest, I'm sort of pessimistic about it. This is part of the reason why I feel Melty should be a little bit cheaper than what it is now, even with the current discount that makes it $19.99. But... hey, I'm still recommending this, aren't I? That just shows you how much I like the game.\n\nClick here for part 2","April 20","true","5.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As a fan of both, I was ecstatic to learn that Melty Blood was coming to Steam. For quite some time it's only been available in a copy of Carnival Phantasm(which is ridiculously pricey for what 13 episodes?) and Arc System Works has graciously ported it to Steam.\n\nPros:\n+ Addicting gameplay\n+ Multiple movesets for each character\n+ Beginner friendly\n+ Fantastic soundtrack\n+ Not a fan translation\n+ Unique and great characters\n\nCons:\n- Buggy online play\n- Lag and disconnect are frequent online\n- Side panels that can't be turned off\n- Intro dialogue not translated\n\nOverall, Melty Blood: Actress Again is worth your money if you enjoy fighting or Type Moon games. It's fun and addicting as hell that is easy to pick up and contains very satisfying gameplay. The few cons are the online play but are currently being fixed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodyoverdrive/recommended/411370/","bloodyoverdrive","bloodyoverdrive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodyoverdrive/","187 products in account","Melty Blood is a momentum and pressure-centric fighting game.\nI'll try to cover what makes melty unique compared to other fightans:\n\n-Simple and low res, but very fluid and stylish spritework. This makes it easier to see and recognize startup animations.\n\n-Easy motions for special moves; nothing more complex than a half-circle motion. Combined with the relatively large buffer window for specials, melty is an easy game to pick up and mash for anybody familiar with fighting games.\n\n-Very loose cancel window after normals. In C and H moon, you can pretty much press any button after any other button. Gattlings are only present in F moon. This creates a technique called 'reverse beat', in which a move with a long recovery can be wiff canceled into a button with faster recovery. These properties mean that pressure if focused around normals; you want to leave a 1~2 frame gap between normals to catch people trying to do something other than blocking.\n\n-Throw properties. The character waking up has a few frames of throw invincibility and can OS with 1ad. They are relatively weak and hard to hit given the speed and reach of 2a. Once you earn respect, you can't just spam throw to win the round, instead you must continue pressurring with normals in order to get an opening.\n\n-Teching when hitting the ground is done by holding a direction. There is a short hop with invlun followed by a brief vulnerable recovery. During oki there is no vairable timing, which means that the person waking up may get caught in a meaty attack if they choose to tech incorrectly. This heavily favors the attacking player as they can do a combo and follow it up with another one if done correctly. Blocking and teching properly becomes important skills in order to stay alive.\n\n-Everybody gets a double jump AND an air dash. Air counterhits pop the enemy in the air and is untechable until they hit the ground. This is an easy, damaging, and important way to convert into a combo+knockdown. Most characters also lack an anti-air move. Given all this air mobility, the importance of air counterhits, and lack of grounded anti-airs means most of the footsies occur in the air.\n\n-Crossup protection. Seeing how easy it is to hop on your opponent's head, the game has crossup protection, which allows you to block a crossup by still holding back. No gay ambiguous Ryu j.MK setups.\n\n-2abc5c jbc jbc air throw. You now know the basic bnb for almost the entire cast. Less emphasis on combos, more  on spacing, pressure, and oki.\n\n-Huge cast of viable characters. If you can get momentum, you can come back and win the round.\n\nMelty Blood is easy to pick up and play, and if given a little bit of dedication and effort, can become an enjoyable fighting game experience.","April 19","true","34.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

This has been a favorite of mine for about a third of my life now, and the awsome, slick looseness of melty blood is something you really dont find in any other fighting game. its one of a kind\n\nthe core gameplay here is as good as always. the game is slick and insanely fast-paced, and combos are really fluid (emphasis on "fluid" as opposed to them having a lot of weight). the game is really beginner friendly, too; theres no tutorial, but there isnt an insane plethora of systems here to overwhelm you, attacks are easy to use and combo with, and specials all use relatively universal motions that are easy to execute\n\nits worth noting that this is a game based a lot on combos, which might be weird for some people. a common match involves a lot of moving around really fast, trying your darndest to catch the opponent off guard, and once you can get them, wiping out about a quarter to half of their HP bar. obv a fight is more complicated than that, because peeps arent going to let you get them into good combos, so you gotta have experience to back up your execution\n\nas for online play, i think it may be too early to come to a good conclusion, but immediately after launch, connection quality varied wildly. you could get some matches that were good, or sometimes you could get a full second or more of delay. more often than not, a fight would start fine but the latency would gradually creep in during. as it settled down, i suppose, connections started to get much better. maybe its late and so not a lot of people are on; for whatever reason the server was running smoothely, and a majority of the fights i had felt like they may as well be local\n\ni cant really judge the quality of multiplayer lobbies, but its quite functional here. you can quick ranked matches or costumized ones (where you can prefer to fight peeps from your region or whatever), and you can do normal player matches. unranked matches can only be done in rooms (of up to 6 people), and thats pretty weird, but i dont really mind it\n\ni think this game is really worth everyones time, obv i recommend it. $25 is a pretty steep price for this old of a game with so little production value, though","April 19","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Typemoon Fan\n3. General Anime fan\n\nI've played tons of fighting games but I'm in no way super competitive so I can't explain to you what this game has as far as mechanics over other titles. what I can tell you is that it's characters is highly diverse with even the silliest ones fitting well into the world. There is no story mode however the Arcade mode of the game will provide at least enough dialogue to get you invested in the fighter, their goals (or lack thereof), and a hint of the lore.\nTo add to that each character has three different styles. Crescent, Half, and Full moons. If you're a combo heavy player you'll enjoy Crescent Moon style. Full moon style gives you hard hits and decent damage at the sacrifice of usually being slight slower. Finally Half-Moon style cuts out a lot of the more complicate mechanics and usually gives your character a more vast move set that is a mix of the other two. This essentially gives the already sizable cast nearly triple the size as they can play like a totally different fighter depending on the style you pick\n\nThe music of the game is fairly well done with a mix of mellow and harder hitting tracks. Plenty of stages, and while this game is a bit old the sprite work is still hasn't aged a day.\n\nThe netplay has been solid for me so far. Haven't had trouble playing in over 4 man lobbies.  Honestly there isn't very many flaws I can personally come up with. It is, and has remained, one of my favorite 2d fighting games and I once again highly recommend it.","April 20","true","17.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There's not much modes to play\n- No tutorial. You have to learn everything yourself or using online guides\n- Bad netcode.

Not only that, but each has 36 different colors to choose from. FOR FREE!\n\n+The movement is increidbly crisp and clean and anything you want your character to do you probably can do.\n\n+ Combos are a little difficult but they each have a pretty basic way to do an ok combo, their is more in depth combos to master as well but if you wanna just play the game for fun you can do that as well with just a little bit of time.\n\n+ You can combo into air grabs, so ♥♥♥♥ing juicy.\n\n+ You can grab people out of wake up supers as well, ♥♥♥♥ YOU STREET FIGHTER!\n\n+ Voice acting is really good, even if I don't speak Japanese. lol\n\n- With all that being said the game is really fast and the offense is really powerful, you might be stuck in blockstrings for a long ♥♥♥ time and most of the time you'll have to burn meter if your character doesn't have a reversal, so losing can be super irritiating.\n\n- A lot of the characters are visible clones of each other, so bad to the point that the difference between two characters is one wearing glasses and one is smirking, but visuals aside they all play very differently.\n\nTry this game out, it's literally the best\n\n","April 19","true","5.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

However, if you've used the Mirror Moon fan translation patch that was still being worked on, you can tell the dialogue differs much from this release. Also, remember to use CCaster if you want good online gameplay and better matches.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome, smooth, and fast-paced with combos that can be easy to make and air dash combos are very fun to pull off! There a total of 31 characters if you count the three moon styles for each character. So, you're going to have a great time to discover and play with most of the characters to familarize and creating yout mains. The animation for each of the characters are great and fun to look at.\n\nThis game series is a underrated gem and when I share the game to people; they either never heard of the game before or any of the Type-Moon universe at all! Even, when they're average gamers, too bad they messed out on this hidden gem!\n\nMelty Blood is an niece fighting game that is pretty well known to the fighting game community thanks to being released back in December 2002 on Japan followed by the Re-Act expansion and the later the arcade sequel Act Cadenza both released 2004 and 2005 respectively. Then the Act Cadenza Ver. B was released in 2007 with balance issues fixes and bug fixes plus unique added features such as tag team. The first Melty Blood is the sequel to the famous Tsukihime visual novel from Type-Moon, the story takes place about 1 year after the events from the visual novel from the true Arucied ending of Tsukihime.\n\nType Moon and French Bread did a wonderful job of updating and fixing the game with many updates and the later updates is Actress Again and the first revision came out in 2008 and the final update which is v1.07 with the 1.4.0 patch is Actress Again Current Code which was released only Carnival Phantasm Season 3 Blu-ray limited edition! The set became extremely rare and hard to find in Japan, so many Type-Moons such as us won't be to buy and play the game officially instead we'd have to pirate the game with the fan translation patch.\n\nDue to how awesome this fighting game is compare to other ones is how there are 3 fighting styles to each characters plus the nature of accessible to newcomers and veterans alike! The combo and air combo chains make Melty Blood an awesome game! The elegant memorable iconic characters, story, setting, vampires, and the wonderful music will make you keep coming back to play again and again! Melty Blood is still being talked about today after the final revision update came out back in December 31, 2011 on Windows PC.\n\nMy most favortie characters is the following: Vampire Sion/Sion TATARI, Arcueid Brunestud, Kouma Kishima, Ryougi Shiki, and Riesbyfe Stridberg. They're one of my mains, so I enjoy using them a lot I love Sion and Vampire Sion the most, I love her personality and character! She is not a vampire fan and pretty angsty about her condition if you know her backstory. It is why I love her and enjoy her stotic determined intelligent nature and at the same time controlling her vampiric impulses.\n\nMelty Blood Actress Again takes place after a year from the true ending of Melty Blood folliowing the events of the expansion pack Melty Blood Re-ACT and  Melty Blood Act Cadenza. A event known as 'Hologram Summer' appears repeating the events from the first Melty Blood.\n\nI am grateful to the Mirror Moon staff of working hard on the english translation patch and the able to understand and play the Melty Blood series on PC which was a Japanese only release.\n\nI love Melty Blood and I am a huge fan of the game series, I collect almost all of the scale figures and the prize figures plus the physical copy of the games and the Carnival Phantasm Blu-ray Complete limited edition set! I am also a huge Type-Moon fanatic so I am obessed with the Nasuverse and the Fate series too! But I enjoy and love Tsukihime more and I can't wait for the Tsukihime remake visual novel to come out in Japan sooner and later with a english translation patch later on!\n\nThis is the first Melty Blood game ever officially released on Steam.\n\nWhether you're new or old to this series, I recommend to buy this game now and hopefully it will convince Arc Drive Systems and French Bread to release the earlier Melty Blood games on Steam!\n\nI still suck at this game and not too good when playing aganist opponents, because I get destroyed easily. I should have discovered Melty Blood and the Nasuverse a long time ago but I was a fool then...Melty Blood is what started for me to discover Tsukihime and the Fate series!\n\nSo buy and enjoy playing this awesome cult-classic fighting game which not too well known to the masses due to being Japan-only release at that time and it's a Vampire fighting game which is pretty rare!","April 20","true","16.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Anyone can pick it up and be able to play in a couple dozen minutes. This is not to say that the game has a low skill cap; in fact, MBAACC is a very hard game to master. There are many mechanics and 3 "Moon" styles for each character on the expansive roster that create many different combinations of how each character can be played.\n\nIn terms of execution, Melty Blood is not as execution heavy as some other ArkSys games like Guilty Gear.

That said, there is 1 big issue that should be taken into consideration before dropping any money on this port.\n\nFirst, the Good stuff.\nThe fighting mechanics feel very nice, but because every fighter is largely quarter-circle, z-motion, and down-down specials, they may feel really close to each other in terms of controls.  I personally came to like this, as it made every fighter feel accessible, while at the same time still forcing you to actually learn how they play, but some others may not feel this way, so keep that in mind.  Also, the soundtrack is pretty rad too.  There is also an abundance of character playstyles, as there are 31 total characters, but each character has 3 different Moon-Styles, which are somewhat similar to Mortal Kombat X's variant types.  And these 3 different styles, while having similar moves, all perform considerably different from each other, so it doesn't feel entirely like you're playing the exact same character.  As far as Singleplayer content goes, this game packs about as much stuff as you would expect from any fighting game: there's the standard Arcade Mode, a Versus Mode, and a Training Mode.  Arcade Mode is where you'll get the 'story' for the game, if you're into that stuff, and from what I've seen the story is pretty enjoyable, especially for Type-Moon fans who are already familiar with the series.  If you play solo, or locally with a friend, then this game will serve you just fine.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say the same for the online multiplayer.\nAs of right now, the netplay for this port is just awful.  I spent a good 15 minutes just trying to connect to somebody online, and the one time I managed to actually start a match, I was experiencing a good whole second or two of input lag, which basically made the match unplayable.  From what I hear, I'm not the only one this happened to either.  Hopefully ArcSys fixes this, as it seems like they're well aware of the issue, which is the primary reason I still recommend this game.\n\nOverall, I give this game a solid 7/10.  As good as this game is, the poor netplay seriously holds this game back.  That said, if you're willing to wait a bit for the netplay to get fixed, or if you'll mostly be playing online, then this is a title I definitely recommend.","May 1","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While a few of the sprites might have aged a little bit, the visuals in this game are outstanding, and it has one of- if not the very best soundtrack in a fighting game, with many iconic tunes with a ton of variety. Definately purchase this.\n\nNow, there are some negatives. These are mostly just small nitpicks, so bare with me. Now, from what I've heard of the netcode, it could definately be better, as I've heard of multiple cases of lag and disconnections. However, it seems these netcode problems are being patched as I'm writing this, so we'll see how it will turn out in the future. The second problem I have is a very minor one, but a problem nonetheless. When in training mode, there is a option to be able to reset the position of the characters at where you started. Most fighting games have this, but in this port things are a little different. In most other fighting games, the standard button for resetting positions are usually the select button, when playing on a stick or DS3 that is. However, when you set the button for training mode reset, the select button is the button for removing buttons, which forces you to use a different button. Also, when you do reset the positions, you reset the music as well, while it usually just continue from where it was in other games. These are VERY minor things, but I would really appreciate it if these problems could be fixed.","May 1","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That said, the netcode is not. Arc System Works is currently working to improve it, which is a welcome thing. However, if you are like me and have little to no interest in online and prefer to play with friends locally, this can be a great addition to your library. The game engine is fun, the characters are all varied and there are many of them. Even better, each character comes with three gameplay variations, so in a way, you get thrice the amount of characters advertised. The music is enjoyable and the story mode is quite funny with its comedic skits and pop culture references. A negative thing might be the lack of modes and the aforementioned (currently) bad netcode.\n\nAll in all, highly recommended.\n\nAlso, rest in peace, Miyu Matsuki, voice of Hisui and Mech-Hisui.

Although having a roster with half of them being clones, is a very solid game with an easy learning curve. Every character and style is viable despite maybe a few rough matchups (Excluding the Necos if you treat them as joke characters), so once you pick a favorite you're ready to go.\n\nIf you're one of the few who gets a huge interest on this genre's story mode (in this case Arcade), you're in a tough situation. Not only you have to play vanilla Melty Blood (Which had routes and Apocalypse-joke bosses), but also have knowledge of the Tsukihime series. You might get some hints from the Fate/ series or Kara no Kyokai (Also by Type-Moon and in the same universe), but only huge fans of the series and/or the company will know most of the lore and inner jokes the dialogue will keep throwing at you.\n\nThe port is very solid thanks to being a quite old game so even the most ancient PC is able to run it without problems, but still has some small problems. Once in a while the game might crash, and in my experience happens during Arcade. For some reason the game also takes a lot of the CPU to run, but until is solved in a patch you can solve it on Task Manager.\n\nDon't be fooled by the decade old sprites.

When that place shut down I was devastated.  Thanks to whoever brought this awesome game to Steam.  Now for a (admittedly biased) review...\n\nThis has long been my favorite fighting game of all time though not exactly because it is the best fighting game in the world.  I do not have the reflexes or the technical skills to dominate at Street Fighter or King of Fighters because those games require very sharp very specific abilities.  Melty Blood has never seemed that way to me.  I won't go so far as to say "a fighting game for button mashers" but at times imbalances in the game allow you to get away with that.  To be fair my experiences were with the original.  Further I will say that I have been absolutely demolished enough time by a skilled Chaos player or a Shiki player who simply didn't let me touch them to know that, if you have those skills and reflexes I lack, there is enough technical possibilities here to delight any fighting game fan.\n\nSummary:  A fighting game for the masses (in my opinion) that still has enough technical ability to let players who want to play competitively do so while still letting those of us who just love to kick our friends butts with anime characters (and have our butts kicked by them) have fun.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.

Upon researching further, I found many people saying that it was one of the smoothest, funnest, hardest, and rewarding fighters they had ever played. Wanting context, I went and played Tsukihime, the visual novel ( from 2000 ( Its pretty ancient )), and left with not only a newly found addiction to VN's, but a love for my new favorite company aside from nintendo (type moon) and one of the most enjoyable fighting games I have ever played. If you find fighting games more fun to play than to watch, then Melty Blood is what you've been looking for. If you love beautiful, fluent sprite work, then Melty is godsend. If you want a fictional world filled with alot of consepts and philosophy, then Tsukihime is for you, and you'll find soul in your character. I think this is arc systems hidden gem revealed to the world, and I cannot exaggerate how great a game this is.\n\nPros:\n+ Its incredibly fast paced\n+ The mindgame potential in some matchups are incredibly high\n+ A huge focus to movement options\n+ High pressure situations\n+ Well balanced gameplay\n+ Great shoutout to fans of Tsukihime / Kagetsu Toya\n\nCons:\n- Fairly hard to learn\n- Netplay has always had problems\n- Many players have played for decades, so its pretty hard to get into, and the meta has pretty much already been set by the Japanese community 8 years ago...\n- Based off of a now obscure eroge","April 23","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a dream come true!\n\nAs far as fighting game goes this game isn't quite as deep as stuff like Guilty Gear, Street Fighter or Marvel, but it's fun and there's enough depth in it to allow a player to grow should they want to take their game to the next level.

Anyone can pick it up and be able to play in a couple dozen minutes. This is not to say that the game has a low skill cap; in fact, MBAACC is a very hard game to master. There are many mechanics and 3 "Moon" styles for each character on the expansive roster that create many different combinations of how each character can be played.\n\nIn terms of execution, Melty Blood is not as execution heavy as some other ArkSys games like Guilty Gear.

That said, there is 1 big issue that should be taken into consideration before dropping any money on this port.\n\nFirst, the Good stuff.\nThe fighting mechanics feel very nice, but because every fighter is largely quarter-circle, z-motion, and down-down specials, they may feel really close to each other in terms of controls.  I personally came to like this, as it made every fighter feel accessible, while at the same time still forcing you to actually learn how they play, but some others may not feel this way, so keep that in mind.  Also, the soundtrack is pretty rad too.  There is also an abundance of character playstyles, as there are 31 total characters, but each character has 3 different Moon-Styles, which are somewhat similar to Mortal Kombat X's variant types.  And these 3 different styles, while having similar moves, all perform considerably different from each other, so it doesn't feel entirely like you're playing the exact same character.  As far as Singleplayer content goes, this game packs about as much stuff as you would expect from any fighting game: there's the standard Arcade Mode, a Versus Mode, and a Training Mode.  Arcade Mode is where you'll get the 'story' for the game, if you're into that stuff, and from what I've seen the story is pretty enjoyable, especially for Type-Moon fans who are already familiar with the series.  If you play solo, or locally with a friend, then this game will serve you just fine.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say the same for the online multiplayer.\nAs of right now, the netplay for this port is just awful.  I spent a good 15 minutes just trying to connect to somebody online, and the one time I managed to actually start a match, I was experiencing a good whole second or two of input lag, which basically made the match unplayable.  From what I hear, I'm not the only one this happened to either.  Hopefully ArcSys fixes this, as it seems like they're well aware of the issue, which is the primary reason I still recommend this game.\n\nOverall, I give this game a solid 7/10.  As good as this game is, the poor netplay seriously holds this game back.  That said, if you're willing to wait a bit for the netplay to get fixed, or if you'll mostly be playing online, then this is a title I definitely recommend.","May 1","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While a few of the sprites might have aged a little bit, the visuals in this game are outstanding, and it has one of- if not the very best soundtrack in a fighting game, with many iconic tunes with a ton of variety. Definately purchase this.\n\nNow, there are some negatives. These are mostly just small nitpicks, so bare with me. Now, from what I've heard of the netcode, it could definately be better, as I've heard of multiple cases of lag and disconnections. However, it seems these netcode problems are being patched as I'm writing this, so we'll see how it will turn out in the future. The second problem I have is a very minor one, but a problem nonetheless. When in training mode, there is a option to be able to reset the position of the characters at where you started. Most fighting games have this, but in this port things are a little different. In most other fighting games, the standard button for resetting positions are usually the select button, when playing on a stick or DS3 that is. However, when you set the button for training mode reset, the select button is the button for removing buttons, which forces you to use a different button. Also, when you do reset the positions, you reset the music as well, while it usually just continue from where it was in other games. These are VERY minor things, but I would really appreciate it if these problems could be fixed.","May 1","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Melty on Steam! I wasn't looking at upcoming titles, so this took me by complete surprise. But as a long time fan of Arc System Works, I have been very pleased as of late, because we now Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign-, XX Accent Core+R, BlazBlue: Chronophantasma Extend, and Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code, all available on the PC market. Now, all we need is Under Night In-Birth EXE: Late, and the new Xrd, -Revelator-. Either way, the West finally has a great collection of 2d fighters on PC, and it's amazing to see American fans be able to play these games here.\nThe game itself is, of course, a solid fighter. A large, diverse cast list, multiple fighting styles for each character, a system not overly difficult, but deep enough to keep you learning new things all the time, and fun, balanced gameplay. French Bread's fighters manage to find a way to very evenly balance their rosters, and make each character a viable option. For those looking to try out an Arcsys fighter, but have been hesitant because of seemingly complicated system mechanics, Melty is a great place to start, because, although it can be as wild, and over-the-top as BlazBlue, or Guilty Gear, it isn't quite as intricate, and casual players shouldn't feel overwhelmed with just picking it up and playing.\nFantastic game! Keep 'em coming Steam, and Arcsys!","April 20","true","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Superb. Exemplary! Holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, folks \m/\n\nIt's wonderful to not only have an official port with the backing of the developers but to feel the love for the INTENSE efforts of fan-circle Mirror Moon over the years to translate everything related to Tsukihime. It is assumed that if you are down with Melty Blood, there is a decent chance you have used the excellent patches provided by Mirror Moon for OG Melty Blood, Re*Act and Act Cadenza (not to mention the original Tsukihime and its various spin-offs).\n\nThis isn't a bunch of lingo to frighten initiates - what was once a universe that was exclusively the province of people willing to import games and work with patch groups can now be enjoyed by anyone! And Melty Blood shows up in competitive tournaments precisely because it is a game that is universally friendly to the novice player while encouraging (and rewarding) sincere mastery.\n\nIf you are a Type-Moon noob, this is the kind of game that could really turn your life upside down.\n\nPrepare to hunt down a bunch of awesome ♥♥♥♥ you never knew existed! Welcome to Hiroko Tokita's world... Deep and intriguing characters, paired with developer French Bread's immaculate fighting engine - this thing makes no attempt to hide its admiration for legacy Street Fight and King of Fighter titles while providing a modern, fun and complex 2D fighting system!\n\nIn short: a pleasure, a treat, and worth every penny of its retail price!","May 5","true","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is an impressive game with very fluid character movement and an intuitive combo system, allowing for both new players to quickly dish out pressure and combos after just starting while rewarding long time players for truly optimizing their characters. Surprisingly, the older, PS2 version of the game had made enough of a name for itself in the US to be voted into EVO 2010 over many other popular fighters at the time. To this day, many fighting game players know of it and have tried it.\n\nThe translation work done on the game is excellent, as it now allows for some players to appreciate aspects of characters they were unable to read before. Seeing as this is also one the official release of the latest Melty Blood, I am also sure a lot of Japanese players who did not already own it are thankful for a digital copy.\n\nUnfortunately, the game suffers some drawbacks on release. For one, there have been players who have been playing this game, in particular this version, for several years, so some player matches and ranked will turn out to be a daunting experience. However, it is a very easy game to learn, and there have been so many tutorial videos on each of the characters (93 characters if we include moon forms), the game could be played with purely fighting game fundamentals.\n\nThe netplay is fairly attrocious; delay is compounded during matches, so the longer a match draws out, the more input delay both parties will have to suffer. The bundled MBAACC that could be purchased years ago contained a solid netplay matching system and recognizable delay. Considering the other types of netplay ArcSys and FrenchBread have developed for their most recent games, this is really a sour experience.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game for the fun factor. However, I feel that some aspects still need some work to finalize into a great fighter.","April 19","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For one, there have been players who have been playing this game, in particular this version, for several years, so some player matches and ranked will turn out to be a daunting experience. However, it is a very easy game to learn, and there have been so many tutorial videos on each of the characters (93 characters if we include moon forms), the game could be played with purely fighting game fundamentals.\n\nThe netplay is fairly attrocious; delay is compounded during matches, so the longer a match draws out, the more input delay both parties will have to suffer. The bundled MBAACC that could be purchased years ago contained a solid netplay matching system and recognizable delay. Considering the other types of netplay ArcSys and FrenchBread have developed for their most recent games, this is really a sour experience.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game for the fun factor. However, I feel that some aspects still need some work to finalize into a great fighter.","April 19","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a lot of fun and quite easy to get into.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast paced fighting game, this is the one to get. There's no shortage of characters to choose from, with a huge variety of playstyles. The game is very well balanced for competitive play, but still is great for casual games.\nI haven't delved much into the arcade mode story as there hasn't been an english translation around for very long, not to mention the AI is a bit wonky to say the least. Even so, arcade mode can still be fun. Either way, I think most people care more about playing against other people, so the arcade mode is good enough as it is.\n\nAt launch there was a lot of issues with latency and laggy games online for me and others as well, but that issue seems to have cleared up, so I'm looking forward to lots of great online play.\n\nI love this game to death and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fighting games. Do consider trying it out.","April 19","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The arcade mode has alot of great interactions if you are a fan. If not it probably will not make much sense for you.

It expects you to have read Tsukihime which is a great VN unfortunantly there is no anime adaptation however there is a servicable manga as well as a manga that explains the first melty game which I never played either. There is one non tsukihime related character Ryougi Shiki that is from kara no kyouki. There is a fantastic anime for this from studio Ufotable who have made the great fate zero and fate stay night ubw anime.\n\nAll in all a great game\nLots of fan service but still a fantastic fighter that lets it stand on its own.\n\n\n\n","April 20","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It so happened that a friend of mine at school somehow managed to pool together funds for the set and bought it, with the sole intention of installing the game on everyone's computers and fun was had for the last few months of our school life. I never thought that MBAACC would ever make it to the West, much less on something like Steam, so when I heard that it was releasing late April of 2016, I was ecstatic to say the least. Well, how well does the NA region version fare with the original packaged version? Well, continue reading to find out!\n\nFor what started off as a spin-off doujin fighting game of Type-MOON's Visual Novel, Tsukhime, the series has certainly evolved and gotten better (not every character has an infinite combo any more, for example). The general story for the game typically involves the strange mist that has covered the town and changes people who enter it, but for each character, there are either slight changes to the story or it covers a character that is dead in the Tsukihime universe, such as Roa and Kouma Kishibe and for what purpose they are alive again. The story can be pretty nonesensical, even if you have knowledge of the game MBAACC is based off of, but it's certainly entertaining to say the least. My biggest qualm with it is that a lot of the references and character interactions will more than likely be lost on someone who has absolutely no knowledge of the game or its VN original, but with games like these, the story isn't exactly what you play it for. I'm also a little irked on how the translation for the game is; it commonly swaps between using the original Japanese honorifics (i.e, Kohaku sometimes referring to Akiha as "Akiha-sama" at time, but in other moments with the exact same line spoken in Japanese, it'll swap out to "Master Akiha".) Some the text also has some wierder choice of words for a coresponding situation, but alas, it's not too big of a deal in the big picture, I'm just very picky when it comes to translation quality and it shouldn't affect someone else's enjoyment.\n\nWhile the graphics aren't exactly the best for a port of an Arcade game, it certainly isn't the worst looking fighting game out there but it is definitely dated by today's standards. While the in-game graphics are okay, the character portraits look nice and can be fairly comical during the Win screens and Story Mode, which is a nice addition to any game, much less MBAACC. The music for the game is absolutely phenomenal, and Raito deserves all the praise he can get for creating one of the best fighting game soundtracks I've ever heard; It's right up there with Guilty Gear and Touhou HIsouten - Scarlet Weather Rhapsody as one of my favorite fighting game OSTs. MBAACC runs very smoothly, without any frame dip (until you go online that is, but I'll get to that in just a moment) and is one of the most fluid fighting games I've ever played. Now, when you start up one of the various play modes, you'll probably notice once you pick a character it gives you an option for "Crescent Moon", Half Moon" or "Full Moon" playstyles. Each playstyle is unique and not only gives each character certain abilities (like Crescent Moon allowing for "Reverse Beat" hits and the ability to go into a frenzied "Blood Heat" mode with enough gauge and conditions fufillled, Half Moon giving more block priorities and Full Moon allowing you to CHARGE UP your Heat Gauge), they also change the move set for each character. Let's use the character Archetype;Earth, for example. With the CM playstyle, she has a ground projectile that faces its longer side away from the player to hit opponents in the front, but with the FM playstyle, said projectile changes direction when used and points itself towards the person using it, as to hit an opponent from behind. The playstyles in this game are what make MBAACC so unique compared to other fighters, and it's very fun to try out all of the various playstyles and see what works best for each player, as opposed to being locked into one moveset that may or may not be very efficient. Each character also has a shield skill that if timed right, can negate most opponent's attacks, give yourself gauge to use AGAINST them, and if you have Blood Heat active, can be turned into a devastating attack that deals massive ammounts of damage to your opponent. Think if Exdeath's "Omniblock" skill had an instant EX burst attached to it, and that's what shielding in this game can do.\n\nNow, my biggest concern with MBAACC is the netplay. I love this game to death, but for crying out loud can the netplay be ANY worse? The netplay was a big concern even with the original game, so I thought that for the Western release, they could've at least improved it a little bit and made it quite a bit more playable, since the Netplay is what people play fighting games for if they have no one around to play the game with (such as someone like myself), but it's about as bad as Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R's netcode on PS3. I'm really disapointed that MBAACC has such a mediocre netcode, but being that it's published by Arc System works, I guess I should've expected this. I just hope that netplay is improved in an update at some point or someone makes a mod or add on like Hisoutensoku's sokuroll application to improve netcode. If the netcode is improved by a great amount, I'd probably be putting all of my time into this game just like I did all those years ago, but alas, until such a glaring issue is improved, MBAACC will merely be my go to fighter when my roommate has reign of the TV.\n\nIn closing, I love Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code to almost the fullest ammount I can, even with the issues I've stated before. I regard this game as much as I do Touhou Hisoutensoku (which is also a PHENOMINAL game), and it will forever be one of my favorite games of all time. Do I recommend this? As much as humanly possible.\n\nPros:\n- Fluid mechanics\n- "Moon" style makes every character feel like three different characters, giving added fun\n- Amazing music\n- Controls are very easy to learn, but hard to master\n- Can use controller or keyboard to play, which is always lovely\n- Large cast of characters\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat iffy translation\n- Mediocre netplay (as of 6/04/16)\n- The game has difficulty spikes in story mode that can really put off a player from playing\n- Story mode can be confusing to people who have no knowledge of Tsukihime\n\nI hope you all enjoy this game as much as I have!","June 4","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
