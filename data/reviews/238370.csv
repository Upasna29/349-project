The shield gets also damaged by that\nUsage of more elements do not (or very slightly) increase the AOE, but only the damage\nThose are the most differences between Magicka 1 and Magicka 2 refering on spellcasting and gameplay (those, that many are complaining about).\nI think the other differences are almost visible so I'll gotta tell you, why I prefer Magicka 2 over Magicka 1.\n\n\nResum√©e\nPeople who played Magicka 1 as long as me do have the most problems with getting into the new System of Magicka 2.\nMost of your old spell combinations don't work anymore or feel weak. Everything just felt weak when I've started playing Magicka 2.\nThat was, mostly, because I didn't knew what I was doing because I was playing like I played Magicka 1.\nThat is a fault. And I would recommend every new Magicka 2 player who comes from Magicka 1 to test new spells and combinations because some (*caugh* Spam QSR *caugh*) are more powerful than they were in Magicka 1.\nIt is something you have to get into. It takes time, but also makes more fun to play than in Magicka 1.\nThat comes because it is now harder to survive and you need more knowledge (weakness of several enemies) and reaction (or friends who revive you) in order to be effective.\nBut it also feels better if you made it through a level just by *knowing what you're doing*.\nAlso I prefer the new graphics and music, there is still some good humor in the game and its more long-time-motivating because of artifacts and things you can unlock by playing on higher difficulties (also playing on higher difficulties itself is challenging but fun, too).\n\nSo, my statement overall is:  This game takes its time until it shows you its potential and fun factor, and you have to try out new things, which you also did in Magicka 1, you only have to remember. Give this game a chance and the game will totally be in love with you ;)\n\nI know that my Review was mostly focused on the comparison between Magicka 1 and Magicka 2 and I'm sorry if you waited for a "standalone game review for Magicka 2" but it just shows my own experience and I think that many other people had such an experience.\n\nI hope, I helped you guys with my Review,\n\ncheers =)\n\nNOTE\nMagicka 2 Update:\n"Added Steam and Ice as Individual Elements. Just as it was in Magicka 1 these will take up one slot in the element queue:\n\nSteam is made from Water and Fire\nIce is created from Water and Cold"","June 4, 2015","true","17.4"," 847 of 913 people (93%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","93","847","913","27","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/racer_X_/recommended/238370/","racer_X_","Stormageddon Dark Lord of All","http://steamcommunity.com/id/racer_X_/","272 products in account","The game has been updated since it's initial release. They brought back rebindable keys, and the old spell and movement system. Steam and Ice are their own element, as well as adding a new element, poison to change up the balance of the game without negating the old balance altogether. The Jokes are funnier than ever, the multiplayer is better than ever (you can drop in and out). The campaign is a little weak, but it really is Magicka 2.0. If this was the game that had come out instead of the original version released in May, then nobody would be complaining as much as they were. I still don't think it personally holds a candle to the epic scale of the original campaign, but it is definetly a solid product overall.\n\nUpdate: They just keep updating it. You can ping for revives (though you should be using voice chat anyways), they added two new magicks (teleport and thunderbolt), They made it easier to differentiate new enemies, they made ice and earth armor have "no knockdown" like in Magicka 1. Most of all, these changes signify they're in it for the long haul. They want to make this game as well-loved as the original and are willing to do whatever is necessary to make it that way. I expect the campaign won't get any additional levels, but there's going to be a lot of long term support for this game and it won't just be DLC made to milk us. They're taking care of the community before anything else, which I think is awesome.","October 1, 2015","true","7.5"," 212 of 223 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","212","223","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GarysModRules/recommended/238370/","GarysModRules","Grant - Overwatch??","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GarysModRules/","669 products in account","~~ THE UPDATE ~~\nEDIT: The return of combined element slots (for steam and ice) and the addition of a completely new Poison element have drastically changed Magicka 2. They return not only to restore what once was, but add even more to the game. If you had any doubts before, they are now gone.\n\nThe devs have gone above and beyond to continue to improve the game, so much so that a 64% approval rating on steam is simply an insult. As a member of steam I trust you all to rate this game as it deserves to be rated.\n\nI will now readdress all of my previous points with the update in consideration.\n\n1. Complexity\n\nThe complexity of Magicka 1 is back and more. Steam and Ice Slotting has returned with Poison to add into the mix. Do your classic combos and more.\n\n2. Enemy Difficulty\n\nSingleplayer difficulty has been made easier with patches and you can revive your familiar. Stay mobile and use weaknesses. You can do it!\n\n3. Movement\nNot only is it an improvement IMO, but you can now revert to the original game's click and hold to move. Keep in mind though, this prevents scoot-n-shooting and makes things harder.\n\n4. Rebind Keys\nAdded in a patch.\n\n5. Pvp\nStill want this\n\n------- Slightly outdated review below ---------\nAs someone who has greatly enjoyed Magicka 1, I find many of the complaints people have regarding Magicka 2 to be mainly due to losing footing in their new environment. It's by no means a perfect game, I just want to share my opinion on some of the issues people have, and ways people can improve. (My time in Magicka 2 so far mostly consists of about 7 hours of the Sneek Peek)\n\n1. One of the complaints I see the most is a complaint about less complexity because of an effective rebalance to spells that used to combine multiple elements into one slot (frost + water = ice, fire + water = steam). In Magicka 2, the elements stay in their base form, taking an effective limit of 10 elements (if all were steam or ice) to a hard cap of 5. The elements are all there, but the combined ones now take up more room.\n\nA: You could rightly say that this removed complexity from the game. However, you would not be taking into consideration the developer's desire to base game balance on a true limit of 5 elements. I can understand it's fun to know and use only the best spells, but it is now more important to focus on the weakness of your opponent than just using the same combination of elements in 80% of all fights. The main use of combinations utilizing these elements was just the DPS increase. This change forces players to introduce diversity into their casting, and make more informed elemental choices.\n\n2. Enemy difficulty. So, it has been brought up that in Magicka 2 that enemies are harder to kill, and this makes the game very difficult for solo play. This is true. If you simply take Magicka and head right into Magicka 2, it is going to be a lot harder. The focus on elemental weaknesses and game rebalance have a lot to do with that.  Enemies are fast. It's now harder to just block them with walls. Ranged units are more accurate.\n\nA: What I found myself not taking into account until I got more accustomed to the game, was movement. In Magicka 2, the game expects you to keep mobile while charging spells and casting. This takes a little getting used to, but your movement as a wizard is now essential. While moving, ranged units have much more trouble hitting you, and melee units struggle more to keep up. Just set your path away from enemies and use whatever elements you want to take them down.  Feel free to stay just out of range while moving and casting electric varieties of spells. Take more advantage of the frost element to slow enemies. Also, as a slight aside, you now get a free revive from a little wisp buddy which helps the singleplayer difficulty.\n\n3. Movement. I've seen some complaints about the movement system in Magicka 2 feeling too slick.\n\nA: I am in support of allowing people to use Magicka 1's system of movement as an option menu choice. Constant movement is a big change. Having to manage your elements, movement, and aim can be tough. However, you'll be at a major disadvantage as far as kiting enemies, casting spells, and dodging projectiles are concerned if you revert back to the movement of the first game. The game has been balanced with its movement in mind (go figure), and frankly after actually adapting to it, I like it.\n\n4. The ability to rebind all of the keys.\n\nA: Needs to happen\n\n5. Official PvP mode\n\nA: Needs to happen.","May 27, 2015","true","29.4"," 479 of 603 people (79%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","79","479","603","14","30"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehjeffy/recommended/238370/","tehjeffy","coldie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehjeffy/","554 products in account","TL;DR\nEDIT: I was a bit harsh in my comparison with the original; I recently replayed the first game and after a little longer with Magicka 2 I can see the benefits of the balance changes that were made.\n\nMagicka 2 is different from the original. It doesn't feel like it has improved greatly on it in any meaningful way, however it does feel more polished and there is a sense of freedom that was not present in the first game. Being able to move while you cast is part of the way you have to play the new game. My cohort and I had fun, but I can't say whether I had more or less fun than in the first game. Without my rose coloured glasses, I'd say this is a solid sequel. But the buzz killing bugs really bit me hard.\n\n6/10\n\nLearning to Spell Again\nWhen I saw this in my Steam feed I bought it immediately as I reasoned that if it was as good as the first, it would be worth it. It downloaded in a couple of minutes and my first impression was not good; everything felt a little "detached" compared to the original; I think it might have been the camera, but also the controls didn't feel quite as responsive. I played through the prologue and put it aside as it just wasn't as fun playing by myself as it was with others and I didn't want to ruin it by playing through it on my own so I put it aside until a few more friends had bought it.\n\nIt wasn't shelved for long as this weekend my brothers and I found ourselves with an evening to spare, so they both picked it up and we jumped on the opportunity to learn to spell again.\n\nWe had started on Normal difficulty but because I had already played through the prologue and when I clicked "Adventure" the game decided to start from Chapter 1, so we restarted (on one of my brothers machines) and increased the difficulty while we were at it as we were kind of breezing through the first chapter even without remembering what we were doing. We started again on Bananas and it was a lot of fun, we really felt as though we were battling to make progress, wiping on the first few encounters until we found our rhythm and got our comms back up to scratch. It was quite rewarding on this difficulty level, and while occasionally frustrating it meant that we really felt like we were battling.\n\nThere was an encounter in the early chapters involving some crabs. It took us a few waves to figure out how we could stop them spawning, and we beat the encounter. We were also exploring the levels as much as we could, trying to find the inevitable jokes hidden around. We were loving it. Until it glitched.\n\nMy brother (the host, unfortunately) had gotten stuck somewhere off the map. There are no checkpoints after encounters so at this point we tried basically everything we could to get him out of that spot. We didn't have any emergency teleport spell at that point, but he was unable to summon any elements anyway so he couldn't have cast anything. The camera for some reason at that point wouldn't let us leave a man behind (while it quite willingly leaves people off screen in other situations, more on that later). All the fun and reward that we were experiencing while we were playing the game on Bananas difficulty was instantly converted into anger and frustration when we were unable to progress in a level because of an engine bug.\n\nAngry, we quit the level and switched out for a mini retrospective while we took a short break.\n\nWhat went well?\nThe game was fun and challenging.\nWhat didn't go so well?\nThe game crashed, punishing us for playing it, especially on higher difficulties.\nWhat would we do differently?\nIntroduce a suicide option so when a player is glitched they can opt to die and a fellow player can res them.\nOh wait we didn't build this. OK...\n\nWhat could we do differently as players?\nWe were out of the refund window\nStop doing things like pushing each other off the map\nStop trying to explore every little corner of the map\nDon't spend as much time in the game so it's less likely to crash out (rush through it)\nDon't spend as much time on encounters so if it does bug out it is less punishing (reduce the difficulty)\nAll the above basically boils down to: have less fun.\nAnd we did.\n\nGraphics\nBuggy animations; sprites would often remain electrocuted or in other states incorrectly\nNew graphics are really nice\nUI/HUD takes up way too much of the screen\nWizard sword effects would randomly not be shown, or would show even if they were already used\nCamera gets way too excited about cutscenes and leaves players behind\nControls\nBuggy: conjuring some elements and then casting using the "right click" too quickly would often miss mouse input; this happened many, many times and forced me to introduce a conscious mental delay between when I would cast an element and when I would click the button to cast. That broke my immersion greatly and really frustrated me as it felt like I was battling with the input system. I didn't remember any such frustration in the first game, which I remember being far more responsive. I think this may have been latency related as I don't feel like it happened at all when I was playing single player.\nMovement sometimes jerked around, probably netcode (we really felt this during the final battle with the orbs)\nSounds\nBuggy. Every level started with NO sound effects, just music, for like the first few seconds. We couldn't figure out a reason why, and it broke our immersion every time.\nMusic was enjoyable and fit the atmosphere\nSound effects were fitting when they worked, but didn't play a huge part of the game; I would have liked more audible feedback for some aspects of casting, like some kind of clearly audible sound that indicated that you had successfully started charging an earth element's casting.\nGameplay\nSimilar to the first - pick your elements, spells and combinations based on your opponents and the situation\nSpells didn't carry the same powerful feeling as they did in the first game\nReduced number of elements and made combinations simpler; less fun, less tricky to cast things\nQuick cast slots in addition to above nerfage\nBizarre HUD in multiplayer; really don't need to see the HUD of my teammates. Show me more of the world.\nConclusion\nOverall, we enjoyed the experience but nowhere near as much as we had hoped. The game has a few bugs, and not fun ones. The experience of being a wizard feels nerfed from the original; spells feel less powerful, We had issues with controls, we had issues with stability and we had engine glitches that lost us progress and we had consistent sound bugs.\n\nAs a fan of the first game, I feel a little let down. The first game was buggy as all hell, especially in the early days, and this game feels more polished but still has the sort of rage-inducing issues that hurt its overall enjoyment.\n\nIf you are playing on a console or have some kind of physical impairment that means you can use a controller but not a keyboard+mouse, this game is probably a better choice than the original as casting has been simplified and you don't have to remember spells anymore. But if you are a veteran wizard who was looking forward to using all 8 fingers on your left hand again, you may be disappointed as it feels as though casting has been nerfed.","June 8, 2015","true","9.6"," 125 of 151 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","125","151","5","0"

I feel the negative press is from those who expected to be as good at this initially as they were after many hours in magicka 1.   On most of the thumbs down, the justification has been a comparison to magicka 1, usually on THESE grounds:\n\nThey say: There's quickcast now! Filthy casuals!\nI say: It's optional and disincentivized by cooldowns.  It can be handy in a pinch.\n\nThey say: There are cooldowns! This is so toned down.\nI say: They do not apply if you do not quick cast, apart from like a 2 or 3 second default cooldown, which provides a\nnecessary balance to overpowered spell spam in the first game like lightning bolt or summon elemental.  You could rapid\nfire those spells as fast as you could type to win any battle, eliminating challenge/balance.\n\nThey say: It's like wizard wars now I don't like the controls! I run off cliffs 2 die D:\nI say: Controls were improved to allow move and shoot, channeling healing, and other little tweaks, persistent sword buffs etc. If you ran off the cliff its because you clicked off the cliff.  You'll be revived in 2 seconds if you're playing multiplayer anyway, I'm sorry you have involuntary tourettes of the wrist, but your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• spasms do not justify giving poor reviews to the developers and their product.  The only con is nonremappable keys, which I'm sure will be patched soon. Most fans played magicka 1 with default controls anyway, and would likely play 2 as such even given the option, its not really an illogical layout.\n\nThey say:  The spellcasting is too simplified, I no longer get combined elements!\nI say: So if you wanted 5 steam in the past, you had to hit 5 water and 5 fire, 10 keystrokes. Each icon of fire or water would turn into an icon of steam when its counterpart was added to the queue. Now everything is streamlined to 5 inputs out of 8 elements x 4 cast types, that is to say, icons do not combine into secondary elements now. Spell strengths are mostly equivalent to what they were before but with less keystrokes, and all of the steam and ice sickles etc are still doable. I fail to see the problem.\n\nThey say: YOU NERFED ICE ARCANE LIGHTNING SHIELD 2 SWORD WTF\nI say: So the more professional team balancing and creating this game decided to take away your crutch of a press to win button, and now you're crying.  I'm sorry that you can't adapt and play a game with strategy reaction and teamwork the way it was intended?\n\nAlso on pros: Working netcode.  Drop in drop out.  Weapon/staff unlocks and selections.  Better balance and challenge, new story blah blah blah. I haven't really seen any cons.\n\nAll the bad press is from actual fans of the first game, which are slinging mad bias because if the first game didn't exist and this was the big innovator, most of us would agree the reviews would be like 90% positive at least.  Its a grave injustice, I find it ironic that its the biggest fans of the game raising the biggest stink.  Just get it for yourself and a buddy.\n\nIn a nutshell, its a 15$ game thats more fun than diablo 3. Quit herp derping and just buy one for yourself and a friend. It is quite enjoyable and everyone I've played in game with shared my sentiments here expressed.","May 30, 2015","true","47.0"," 341 of 467 people (73%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","73","341","467","38","4"

Don't get me wrong, the chaos is still a lot of fun, but it doesn't really change, the story is virtually nonexistent, and it is so obviously intended for people who have already played magicka 1, yet it fails EXACTLY to bring that one thing magicka 1 players have been waiting for for years: something new.\n\nMagicka 2 is simply another expansion to the original game with slightly altered game mechanics and improved graphics. To be totally honest, I find presenting it as a whole new game a form of rudeness.\n\nI mean, sure, it has a lot of humour, but there is a problem with that as well:\nIn most games, it is fun to find the occasional easter egg and laugh about it. In THIS game, there is so much humour around every corner and under every stone that it feels like the makers tried to conceal the lack of story with a boatload of cheap humour. In my honest opinion Seitokai no Ichizon had less reference jokes than this game.\n\nIn short: if feel to me like the purpose of this game was not to bring a new and original challenge, not to please the dedicated fans, not to broaden the game's audiance by making a wholly new game from it (because with the amount of bugs in Magicka 1 a wholly new game was much needed)(not that this game is free of bugs, though it has considerably less), it feels like the purpose was to appeal to an audiance as broad as possible in order to rake in as much money as possible. They got me hook, line and sinker, but I have 9 hours in this game and I finished all relevant parts of it.\n\nAnd the extra content? Costs more money.

People that do care about that were probably already playing Magicka: Wizard Wars, and not interested in another story-driven game.  That would explain all the bad reviews this game has gotten.\n\nThe developers have since fully corrected their mistake, and deserve credit for that.  Developers fixing their bad game design (as opposed to bad code) is almost unheard of in the industry.  It would be nice to see more of that.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe spell creation system now has all the original elements, along with the new Poison element.  Most remaining differences (like being able to walk while casting) seem to be improvements.  I now enjoy the gameplay more than the original.\n\nThe voice acting and silly atmosphere is just as good as the original.\n\nThe special effects associated with spells look much better than in the original.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe first thing the player is greeted with after installation is the requirement to create or enter login information for a Paradox Interactive account, or be unable to play online.  I'm sure this didn't help the ratings any.  The justification, that Magicka 2 owners might receive rewards in Magicka: Wizard Wars, was extremely weak.  I already have a Steam account that is perfectly adequate for lobby service.  I wish companies would stop thinking they are so special that they should contribute to everyone's account proliferation problems.  I really, really, don't need to have yet another username and password to remember when it's time to upgrade my computer.\n\nThe only thing I miss from the original spell creation system is the ability to push with water beams.  It would probably be most reasonable to simply add that effect to the Poison and Life Water beams.  Enemies that benefit from being poisoned (undead) are usually harmed by healing, so this shouldn't cause problems.\n\nDifficulty is not scaled based on the number of players, and is clearly balanced with 4 skilled players in mind.  It is often frustrating in multiplayer, and is almost impossible to play solo.  The original Magicka had this problem in some of its DLC (most notably The Stars Are Left).  Since feeling frustrated and laughing are usually mutually exclusive, this does a lot to harm the humorous atmosphere.  I play Magicka for the spell creation system and humor, not the challenge.\n\nMagicka 2 is shorter than the original.  Perhaps DLC will improve this, but given the damage the original design did to sales, and the damage over time the bad ratings are doing to sales, I wonder if Paradox Interactive will consider it worthwhile to develop much DLC.\n\nI don't like the soundtrack as much as the original.  It is in no way bad.  I like it more than most games' soundtracks.  It just doesn't feel as memorable as the original.","November 20, 2015","true","17.6"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","53","56","3","0"

Magicka 1 on the other hand was more relaxed , you had 21 "magicks" with some exrtas as Dlc that all had strong\neffects on the battlefield and knowing how to cast them effectively separated the beginners from the veterans.\n\n\n\n\nEnemies , level design , difficulty:\n\nThis is one of the more subtle yet impactful changes to the game since magicka 1.\nThere is a strong lack of enemy variety , There are factions and each faction will have the same enemy "types";\n\nMelee fodder - weak , runs in a straight line to you , weak to most elements.\nMelee specialist - stronger , runs straight line to you , has a quirk , has some resistances.\nRanged fodder - weak , stands in place and shoots at you , weak to most elements.\nRanged specialist - stronger , moves around , has a quirk or special weapon , has some resistances.\nSpell caster - rather large amount of health , moves around , uses magic typical to the faction , has strong resistances.\nMedium sized brute - large amount of health , sprints at you , mostly melee some tiems ranged , whole lot of resistances.\nLarge size brute - most health , walk about stomping things , very slow.\n\nthe spell casters , medium and large brutes appear sparringly , or even just in specific scripted parts.\nMagicka 1 had a lack for enemies as well but it made up for it with unique level design and scripted events.\nMagicka 2 has little to no unique areas to fight in , You get quickly bored of using the same spell on the same enemy-every screen.\n\nSpeaking of level design , There almost is non.\nThe majority of the levels are just linear walk from left to right with little to no hidden areas , special events , unique- encounters , Combat areas often are just normal grounds with maybe a hazard or 2 (hazzard being a puddle of water).\nAgain magicka 1 didn't have a huge amount but it had some and they were almost all unique to the level,\nOften making a normal fight intense or empowering.\n\nDifficulty in magicka 2 can be summerized with one line;\nMade for 2-4 players.\nGoing through the game solo , you quickly discover how the game completely shafts solo play.\nThe enemy AI always gets close as posibble and swarms around you , often stun locking you in place.\nDue to resitances and quirks you must use cheap tactics like suicide / revive cycle where you unleash spells with no regard until you are imminently killed to be revived and then revive your ferry to proceed.\n( a mechanic thats allows solo play to even exist).\nThe ferry simple acts as a reviver , you WILL die , often.\n\nThe limitation on spell spamming and removal of a large ammount of "Magicks" since magicka 1 Force you into a corner of defensive running around trying to kill priority targets and avoiding one hit kill enemies.\nIts just not as fun , magicka 1 had a similar issue but with strong "magicks"  and the knowhow to use them propery you could control the battlefield like a master wizard.\n\n\n\n\nVisuals , UI :\n\nVisualy magicka 2 is beautiful , the magicka 1 style with higher resolution textures and improved effects.\nThe game has a neat presentation however not even close to magicka 1s.\n\nThe UI is simple , to the point , sometimes confusing.\nI had to google a lot of simple UI features because the game never tells you how to do a hell of a lot of stuff,\nSuch as how to change equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall experience/verdict:\n\nMagicka 2 feels like a 2 step forward 1 step back kind of deal.\nThe core of the game didn't change much but with the new gameplay additions it feels more refined upon.\nthe removal of "magicks" , focus on challenges / multiplayer , little to no story feels like a rushed job to make a quick buck on the magicka name, hopefully future updates  and Dlc make up for this.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would recommend buying on sale if you REALLY like the magicka series.","September 17, 2015","true","15.3"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","53","63","4","0"

So far, I believe that all of the changes are an improvement to the game:\n-Steam and Ice combine again, they even added a whole new poison element (water+death), giving you new options.\n-Keys can now be changed and you can also switch back to the old movement style of Magicka.\n-Stone now charges a lot faster also flies faster, making it a valuable element again.\n-Knockback has also been buffed so you can cherish sending your enemies (and allies) soaring across the entire screen once more.\n-The rather sad variety of Magicks is being increased by the day, with old ones being re-implemented as well as new ones being added (I especially like the prisms)\n-Stone now charges a lot faster and flies further. This combined with increased knockback has the same satisfying results as a fully charged fireball of death in the original Magicka used to have.\n-lightning no longer overwrites beams. Now that hasn't bothered me too much, though it is nice to use the good old lightning-steam beam of doom again (though it is no longer overpowered, but still valuable).\n\nAll in all, the gameplay feels MUCH better than when it was first released and more improvements are still being made.\nThe only thing still bothering me is that you rather quickly run out of stuff to do. My friend and I have been playing this for 5 hours and have almost unlocked every single thing in the game. But maybe they'll add a thing or two in that aspect aswell. As things stand now, Magicka 2 is an entertaining game and surely better than a 65% positive rating.","September 21, 2015","true","5.5"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","36","38","0","0"

This is simply not true. There is a distinction between Devs making deliberate balance and gameplay choices and removing features for the sake of removing features. Yes, there are many things that have changed and that have been adopted from Wizard Wars, but in my opinion a lot of these are not worse or better, they just change the way the player plays the game. Going over the comprehensive list of changes I've seen since the first one and why it's still a great game:\n\n- Spellbar nerfed. The elements that used to combine to one in the spell bar don't. This is the most major complaint I've noticed. However, the only thing this affects gameplay-wise is that lightning no longer works in the same spell with steam (intended effect), and lightning no longer works with ice (side-effect and a combo I actually miss). Nor can you cast 5 of steam or ice. This is obviously a balance choice designed to make it so that you cannot give wet status and deal double lightning damage to a target in the same spell cast. It's essentially a general debuff to wizard damage and makes the max amount of button presses per spell always 5.\n\n- Enemies are are buffed. Enemies move at you faster, are more accurate, have clever skills such as trapping you with walls and can swarm you easily. Noticeably enemies that chill you among groups seem to be pretty deadly if you don't remove it fast enough. There is more focus on finding the correct element to blast enemies with as they all have special weaknesses that take them out quickly.\n\n- Magicks nerfed and made easier to cast. There is now a hotkey system for magicks that makes them quick to cast and works on its own cooldown, and you can still manually cast magicks which also has a seperate, short, invisible global cooldown. The two methods can be used simultaneously to cast two magicks in quick succession. There are also a lot less magicks in the game than the first one. Some are still OP (looking at you dragon strike and thunderhead). You also get a little familiar should you so choose that revives you on death in singleplayer/multiplayer which itself can also be revived with the revive magick, giving effectively infinite lives. Push as a standard move (casting without elements conjured) has been changed into a Magick.\n\n- Movement is buffed. You can now move while casting spells; this can be hard to get the hang of at first, but is crucial for being able to kite and fight the now more challenging enemies. You can also heal while on the go. One of the more effective ways I've found to heal now is no longer setting up life mines but instead standard casting a rock element with four life element no charge at your feet for quick powerful heals.\n\n- Weapon Enchants are buffed. Enchantments that include projectile, beam, and shield type spells work similarly as a one time cast, but spray type and lightning type spells now remain on your weapon no matter how many times you swing with it, unless you come into contact with an element of opposite type or have it "nullified" (more on that in a bit).\n\n- Resistances are reworked. No longer does one resistance level of an element cause complete immunity to it, nor can you give your resistances to others by proximity. It is now on-self and staged in power, requiring more thinking/investment into certain defenses. One resist simply reduces damage. Two removes the harm of status effects, chilled, shocked, burning, frozen, and wet and further reduces damage. Three grants immunity to damage of the type. Four gives you major absorption to the damage type. This means for example should you choose to shield four death, yes you will be able to heal while spamming mines on your opponent, but you will be significantly weaker to physical damage due to not being able to add as much rock or ice armor to yourself.\n\n-Some spell modifiers have slightly less representation. Things such as adding more fire to a fireball, won't cause the radius of the fire explosion after the rock lands to be larger. Similarly AOE attacks won't expand in size. Sprays and lightning retain this ability to grow in range. Other modifiers stay the same, like duration or more damage from adding same type elements.\n\n- Lightning has been reworked. It has increased in spell priority to equal projectile type. Since lightning cannot be used with projectiles rock or ice, there's no info on which is higher. This means that beams no longer carry lightning but lightning instead carries beam element types. It also means that lightning mines are no longer available but instead create a kind of life or death vortex wall. Lightning also causes less stun than before.\n\n- Water knockback nerf. Water element knockback and knockback in general are greatly reduced but still workable. I still use it to keep enemies at bay and for wet status. Mines also don't send you flying nearly as far but some enemy attacks do. This can be frustrating as you can't que spells while in mid-air, something they should change.\n\n- Rock reworked. Charge time greatly extended and distance at low charge reduced. Happens to be a high damage option given that other high damage options are nerfed. AOE Attacks that include rock are particularly powerful since they can be spammed quickly such as water rock death fire (also strong standard cast). Or weapon enchantments like rock death fire x3. Using a single rock in standard cast attacks seems to be best for range and charge.\n\n-Ice has been reworked. Granting yourself ice armor does not cause as much damage with the thorns effect and it also has less damage radius. Ice shards remain powerful. Ice walls and armor now reflect beams, making them much more useful.\n\n- Shields reworked. They now work on a timer that cannot be extended, allow for movement through the barrier, and still protect against beams and sprays, but do not suffice against projectiles which pierce straight through now. The shield dome - shift-middle mouse - now causes a "nullification" effect, where it removes enchantments from your weapon, prevents you from adding more while inside it, and also removing and preventing the effect of status ailments on you, chilled, burning, wet (big bonus there).\n\n- Crossing life and death beams in Co-op. Now creates a 2000 damage blackhole. Able to be resisted with death resistance and a great cheesy damage technique. Risky without resistance. Life, death, and cold elements also appear to have kept the same qualities from the first game.\n\nOn a side note, the campaign feels a little bit shorter than the original, and the humour and references, while still great hadn't tickled me as much this time around. As a plus, the boss battles are all more interesting than before, and enemy type design is more creative. It's a lot easier to hop into a game with friends or complete strangers, and playing through in co-op makes it miles better. If you are a die-hard Magicka 1 fan, and these changes don't sound good to you, stick to Magicka 1. If you're on the fence, get it when it goes on sale. All in all, in my opinion these changes make it a more mobile, defensive, challenging, and strategic game. I have a great deal of fun playing it and look forward to future related projects. Highly recommend it!","May 29, 2015","true","45.9"," 113 of 164 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","113","164","2","4"

This takes away some of the game's difficulty, however.\n+ Familiars. These feel largely unnecessary but I suppose one could consider this a pro.\n+ Monsters seem stronger and have better AI.\n+ Some new and cool magicks.\n\nCons:\n- Campaign feels very short.\n- Some magicks are only unlockable in challenges. This makes little to no sense to me.\n- No active staff abilities.\n- A lack of enemy casters. What happened to druids, disciples and goblin wizards?\n- Very easy boss fights.\n- Can't see where you can unlock certain magicks, weapons or staves.\n- Cringeworthy references.\n- Questionable balancing changes. This is only my opinion, but I sure will miss some of the fun combos. The problem lies in that they deliberately wanted to limit possibilities.\n\nWhy not recommended? Mostly because of how short the campaign was. It doesn't come off as an improvement to the first game at all. The enemies are less varied, the weapons and staves to pick up seem less interesting. Maybe Magicka 2 will have some good DLCs in the future, perhaps then it'll instead be recommended. But as of right now, it doesn't offer much entertainment.\n\nEDIT: Additional pros and cons!\n+ New movement system. You can cast spells while moving. This is a really nice feature, to be fair.\n\n- Lots of magick from the first game are missing. Grease, Rain, Thunder Bolt, Tornado, Fear, and more. I really want to know why they weren't included.\n\nEDIT 2: Following the release of a much appreciated patch, the game is significantly better. However, this review is based on the release of the game.\n\nThe poison element is a nice addition and so is the variety of magicks added. Thunderhead, Ice Tornado and the like.

If you're looking for a new, refreshing, challenging game and want to experiment with the spell system all over again, you've come to the right place.\n\nMagicka 2 is a great sequel to Magicka 1. It's gotten a lot of hate from people who played the first one primarily due to the new spell system which isn't as imbalanced as the old one. Magicka 2 is a lot more challenging than the first game and the difficulty levels and unlock system gives it a lot more playtime and replayability.

The story retains it's funny, lighthearted attitude and is very fun to play through both alone and with friends, and while it's a bit short at nine chapters, none of the chapters fall short in any areas.

If you've played it already you might disagree with me and that's fine.\nIf you haven't played Magicka 2 yet however and you are wondering whether to buy it then i would say go buy the first one instead if you haven't already.\n\nSo far my experience with this game was 20 minutes of trying to get the compulsory Paradox account setup which doesn't connect to the servers half the time. Then after that I ran the tutorial in a similar fashion to the Magicka 1 tutorial, no problems so far except the controls being changed slightly.\n\nHowever, when I started fighting enemies it was so boring and the spells are almost useless as well as using magicks. The goblins are not too bad but the crabs you fight for the first hour of the game can freeze you and one of the big crab enemies is immune to EVERYTHING from the front. I had to invite a friend just so I could get behind it to kill it and then to my surprise they don't send anything but more of these crabs and a crab which fires poison at you for the next hour after that point.\n\nNow you may just say I'm bad at the game but Magicka 1 never annoyed me like that and it never felt like a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to kill something. Whats the point in being given access to all these spells etc when half the enemies you meet are immune to them. For most enemies so far all me and my friend have done is just use Fire as its stupidly OP against anything that isn't resistant to it. While Earth and Ice are completley useless, they do below 1000 damage fully charged while fire gets to that damage with it spell (while casting) in seconds.\nI will probably update this review if I find anything new to consider.\n\nSorry for that rant there.\n\nTL:DR\nBasically the game just isn't balanced well and the enemies are pretty unfair for the player to fight as most spells are ineffective, especially as this is a mere hour into the game (that I've reached).\n\nIf I find anything else worth mentioning in the future i'll update this review.

So as a result, all single player gameplay involves you spamming intermittent nonsense until you die, casting revive on the fairy as you return, then scrambling for a few moments to see if this time around you can squeeze something useful in before death swallows you again.\n\nThis along with changes to the implementation of a few mechanics makes the game decidedly less entertaining. For instance, in Magicka one, using a bunch of water and then weapon equiping it would increase the "force" of the blow drastically enough the send lighter enemies flying to their death, either by smashing into walls or off of an edge. Wheras in Magicka two, the enemy will simply get wet and pushed slightly.\n\nThere are a few physics changes like these, and they all point in one direction, the "shenanigan" factor of the game has been shaved off by about 80%. By having the game elements even be partially borrowed (Mostly even) from a game that was attempted to be balanced for multiplayer pvp gameplay, they have removed the ridiculousness that made the pve of the first game such a unique experience.\n\nAs a result, the game that turned you and you friends into left handed master pianists who slung giant instakilling lighting ice paths and huge rocks towards your foes, occasionally gibbing yourself and others in the process is long dead, covered in foam and with shortcuts and cooldowns slapped onto it.\n\nTL:DR The edge is gone, the fun is gone.","March 28","false","5.0"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","33","42","3","2"

So they implemented those aspects of the game rather than the first one.\n\nFirst of all, Small group of friends and I are playing Magicka related games pretty often. I love the creativity of the game. The freedom of spells and elements. Yet, this is where this game fails. It has it's original humor, original easter eggs (Despite the people who think they are same, there are quite a bit different ones. Look deeper friends!) and a small portion of mechanics. But when you change the core aspect of the game, it can be pretty hard to get used to it.\n\nI understand all the hate. When i started the game first thing i thought was "Dude, what the hell? Why did they made another Wizard Wars?". Controls were different. Spells were different. Combinations were, well... Simply, you cant mix water and fire anymore. It won't turn into smoke and you can't make stupid combinations. That maybe a plus for a PvP game. But in this kind of game, i expect freedom. Not illusion of choice.\n\nYet, i like the game. I get used to it. Try to get out of your comfort zone. I believe it is about that.\n\nThis kind of big changes can attract different attention. I don't think this game deserves a negative review. They made a superb story. And if any of you finished the main story, you should also consider the magick dropping mechanic. It is a great addition. It works for your friends, also.\n\nSo, if i sum it up;\n\nPro;\n\n-Superb story. (Maybe a personal opinion.)\n-Great humor. Very similiar to the first game. You should also play that and Wizard Wars as this game is about both of them.\n-Pretty pretty Magick mechanics. You will experience them as you go along i won't spoil them.\n-Vlad is not a vampire.\n-You can fry everything you see! Almost...\n-Good puzzles if you know where to look. Best easter eggs and references i see in the game history.\n\nCons;\n\n-Oh the mighty optimization. What have i done to you? Paradox can surely work on that, but it was expected.\n-What i call 'Illusion of choice'. They restrict your ability to cast. If you are familiar with WW, this is not important.\n-Vlad is absolutely not a vampire.\n-Pretty short.\n\nOverall I don't think this game deserves the hate it gets. If you know magicka, buy this immidiately. If you don't, try Magicka Wizard Wars. If you like it, buy the first, then this. It is the only game that can be this absurd and this good.\nHope you give it a try. And let's not forget, it will get lots of DLC's too.\nSorry for my English, as it is not perfect.","May 26, 2015","true","9.4"," 116 of 186 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","116","186","11","3"

It is now edited on 11/8/2015\nThe positive:\n-They are adding /things/\n-You can now change your keybindings to your own liking (yay)\n-You can now move like you did in Magicka 1 (yay)\n-And mobs are finally not impossible to kill, as their stats have been reduced (huzzah)\n\n\nThey have changed many things, for better or worse, but the game feels different from\nMagicka 1. And it is primarily why I dislike this game so much.\n\nIn Magicka 1, the primary focus was button mashing. And button mashing is /FUN/. Prep yourself pre-battle with SDFE (shield), mash ASF (sprint) in your keyboard , run around and gather some mobs, mash in SDFEF along with a Shift Right click, ASA (teleport) out of the bomb mine and then just spam DF or FQFQASA. Or dang, just spam the hell out of ASA and go in and out and do your own thing. In Magicka 1, you went HARD and you went HAM which was an amazing playstyle. It was quite frankly a Michael Bay movie and when you entered in so many inputs, you felt good and skilled at the game.\n\nThe negative:\nIn Magicka 2, they removed that core aspect of button mashing. Instead, the general playstyle is channeling spells from a distance, which is /different/.  You can no longer spam spells and the player's ability just feels hindered by the game - you feel weaker, man.\n\nThe Shields:\nBeforehand a simple SDFE would protect you from fire, earth and arcane rather well. Now, the shields run out faster and you need to pay attention to them. And especially when you're so overwhelmed by melee and ranged mobs, things just start getting out of hand.\n\nMashing Heal - Before, you'd heal yourself with just mashing W a billion times and clicking the middle mouse button. You'd heal yourself rather fast, but instead now you need to hold heal, which makes you heal yourself slower. It's really a petty preference of mine, but it's the little things.\n\nMashing Teleport: They renamed the teleport to "Emergency teleport". You can no longer mash ASA, but instead you can use it once every 5 seconds.\n\nMashing Fireballs: You can no longer mash DF, because if you cast it instantly after you've conjured it, the range will be extremely short. The longer you hold it, the farther it goes. This prevents mashing it, when it was so fun to just spam. Why?\n\nI like the fact that you can run and burn/ice people but sometimes the button just glitches some weird ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• happens and the spell doesn't come off. Clunky buttons, man.\n\nGoing Rambo is fun and in this game it's rather hard to do so.\n\nThere's a lot of potential in the game, as the humor of the game is brilliant, but Paradox just needs to take responsibility for the blueball of so many people (primarily mine though) that wanted to have fun with this game, and they should increase the AOE range and damage of the spells. And add in spamming again. And stuff.","May 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 183 of 303 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","183","303","6","5"

Betrayed. Kind of.\nChanges are questionable at best.\n\nHumour... A bit more agressive. Not offensive, agressive. First magicka was like a shy, clunky but funny wizard, who isn't takes himself too serious. By the times of the sequel he bought a red nose, bright stupid robe and megaphone and roams the streets, screaming "LOOK I'MA CLUMSY WIZARD! LAUGH!"\nPoint: Most of jokes there have no point.\n\nOkay, maybe this one isn't correct, and first game was just as screaming "I'M FUNNY", and it's my nostalgic-o-filter removed any bad memories. Soo, this part will be in the final score, but have no influence on it.\n\nMagic system changes... Huge nerf hit the best steam-shock-arcane and ice-earth combos. R.I.P. my only usable lategame/DLC spells. Basic wind attack are magicka now. Also, cooldowns for everything. EVERYTHING.\nThey put a high priority in nerfs. Are we playing serious PvE MOBA now? ..wait, aren't those two terms mutually exclusive?..\nPoint: Unnecessary, even stupid changes.\n\nDifficulty... I was unable to pass trough a some point where you should spin a water wheel. Why? I was alone. Enemies keep spawning endlessly, and water wheel needs to be constantly showered for... For at least 15 seconds, I guess. More than enough for crabs to butcher a player.\nPoint: Simply unplayable at singleplayer. Like at all. Looks like that part with water wheel got changed a bit, with flow of crabs replaced by a few scripted bunches. That point will be rewritten after I make it to the end. Still, no one of my friends wants to buy it now.\n\nInterface and controls... My god.\nWarning: lots of bunnies ahead.\nFirst. What the bunny is this? Hotbar? It's just... Wrong. Magicka is a game about pure button mashing, with disadvantage of high error chance being an important part of the first game. It's like for a fighting game devs to include hotkeys for instant combo attacks.\nSecond. What the bunny is wrong with this camera? At the moment battle beguns it moves to the monsters, basically instantly cornering player with enemies all over the screen. That's bunny beautiful.\nThird. What is this, strafing? Okay, where is my covers, regeneration, machinegun and first-person view?\nGames where attack (shot) happens when you press mouse button may need strafing.\nGames where attack (boulder throw) happens after you release mouse button should NOT have strafing. It's bunny annoying to aim.\nFourth. Loading screens. Menus. Tips.\nAhem. Are you... Wait a second.\nAhem.\nARE YOU BUNNY KIDDING ME?! IF DEVELOPERS ARE TO BUNNY LAZY TO SIT TEN MINUTES IN A BUNNY IMAGE EDITOR AND MAKE A TWO BUNNY SEPARATE "Press X to continue" IMAGES FOR PC AND CONSOLE, THEY SHOULD ALREADY CONSIDER FINDING A NEW BUNNY JOB. Mostly because such laziness shows how much they care about what are they doing. It's literally twenty minutes of work at worst, and it pokes in the eyes of every player from every bunny loading screen!\nOkay, maybe it was due to some technical limitations. Then I'm sorry.\nBUT IT ISN'T BUNNY 80s, AND WE AREN'T PLAYING 8-bit CONSOLE GAMES, ARE WE?\nPoint: Embarrassing. Ugly status effects. Annoying strafing. And I don't want to know what button I should press on gamepad my PC don't have.\n\nGraphics... Okay, spells looks cooler than in first game. But they are just taken from Magicka: WW, aren't they?\nPoint: Better than in first game, same as in MWW. Nothing looks improved.\n\nFinal scores:\nElement        Effect                Humour        Vlad/10                Magic changes        Nerf/10                Difficulty        Alone/10                Interface and controls        Bunny/10                Graphics        MWW/10                Combination of those 5 elements?

No so much. The combat system is oversimplified, and while I can understand them changing mechanics so people can't just use the same combinations they did in the last game, it seems like all the nuance of spellcasting is gone. Rather than having to come up with complex combos to kill enemies, I've found myself using very simple and boring combinations to kill enemies, like fireballs.\n\nMost importantly, I can't recommend you play this game solo. The original magicka had some difficult sections, where you had to really think and diversify your techniques to pass. This game is not like that. It's difficult to the point of being unplayable solo. Enemies swarm you, knock you over, and one single enemy can kill you in just a few hits, and there are typically at least ten enemies on screen at a time. Furthermore, shields are practically useless except for protecting against one single element, and when you respawn you are immediately vulnerable and typically spawned right in the middle of a group of enemies.\n\nThis doesn't require nuanced, flexible thinking, it *REQUIRES* at least two players to be won. While I love co-op games, this game is supposed to be playable solo. Some would call me a masochist because I insisted on playing through the original solo. But this? So far I've found this impossible.\n\nIn general though, the controls feel floaty, you've lost the sense of feeling powerful that you had in the original (powerful meaning dangerous, even to yourself), and it feels like they just slapped the terrible Wizard Wars mechanics onto a new story that I likely won't be able to complete since few of my friends have any interest in this game and it's impossible solo.\n\nI really, really, wanted to love this game. I was totally ready for another game just as good as the original.\n\nThis is not that game. Only buy this if you'll be playing it with friends the whole way through and don't mind an inferior product.","May 26, 2015","false","3.6"," 83 of 133 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","83","133","2","1"

It may have in the past. An update has fixed alot of the beefs people had with and aperently didn't change their negitive review thus the mixed rating.\n\nPros:\n*Move while casting. (While this does take some getting used to it adds more functionality)\n*Graphics look awesome watching videos don't do it justice.\n*Much Improved Physics.\n*New Element Poison. (This adds alot of gameplay value. Think of the possibiltes with a posin element.)\n*More in depth sheilding from elements (Ok in Magicka 1 when you cast Sheild + fire it would make you immune to fire. If you added more fire it would increase the radius. Magicka 2's version are as follows "1 Shield + 1 fire= small damage reduction", "1 Shield + 2 fire = Resistant", "1 Shield + 3 Fire = Immune", "1 Shield + 4 fire = Absorbtion". I just used fire as an example, you can use any element.)\n*Spell hot keys\n*More difficult (Yes that is a bonus dispite whiners that say. People basicly cried because they couldn't finish the level with out some setbacks.\n*Artifacts (Unlock Artifacts that make it as hard or as easy as you want by equiping them in a play though.)\n*More Balanced (you can't just spam the heal spell and expect to be fully healed in 2 sets of all heal)\n*Ice spell is way better now that in Magicka.\n*You can have a load out preped while charging the spell you got. For example you go all rock spell while the rock is charging you can enter another spell combo so it's ready to go after you have fired the rock.\n*They have quite a few unlockables giving you plenty to do.\n*They have mode called trials which is like challenges that unlock as you progress through the story.\n* Enchanted weapons are not just a one swing and yoy have to re enchant but are timed.\n\nCons:\n*Some places are still buggy.\n*The move and casting spells has a slight learning curve but prety easy to get down.\n*When transitioning into a scene your stored combo is gone. (This might be a balance issue)\n*NPC Heads aren't realy to scale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alba19nl/recommended/238370/","alba19nl","AlBaTross","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alba19nl/","59 products in account","So Magicka 2 is finally here..\nI played through the first few chapters of the campaign, and did some challenges and trials.\n\nHas this game changed a lot compared to Magicka 1? Yes it has.\nIs it a good game nonetheless? It very much is.\n\nSo the spell system was redone, or rather, they used the system of Wizard Wars, the biggest changes being the secondary elements now taking two slots with the original elements instead of just one, (example: Steam = Fire + Water instead of just Steam) and the priority of the casting type was rearranged, (Lightning has a priority over Death/Arcane) and while this new system needs some getting used to after Magicka 1, I think it's a good change. It takes away the ability to create some of the most overpowered spells I know, and while it was a lot of fun to just wreck everything in your path with the steam beam, this way it is a lot more balanced.\n\nTe controls are different to both Magicka 1 and Wizard Wars. and while I do think this is the best of the three games, (especially the way you can now walk while casting a spell, I'll come back on that later) It would be a good thing for this game series to just be consistent, instead of players from older games having to get used to the new controls all the time. (But hey, at least they didn't change the arrangement of the spells, that would be horrible!)\nThat being said, the one thing I really missed in this game is the lack of the ability to rebind your keys.. I mean.. come on..\n\nThe enemies are, in my experience, a lot harder than they used to be in Magicka 1. This is partly because there's more focus on finding the weakness of an enemy and using it against it. It takes some time to find the weaknesses, but I like this change. There isn't just one spell that kills every enemy for you. Rather you have to use different methods to defeat different enemies. Additionally, ranged enemies have much better accuracy, and I feel like enemies are made a lot faster, which really means you have to always be moving. The movement mechanic helps a lot with this, as you can now keep walking while you're casting a spell. (It also allows you to come up with some "impressive" dance moves) Overall, the enemies are a lot more challenging, and require you to actually adapt to every situation.\n\nThe new magick system is certaintly interesting, and I like how quickly I can use them now. however, (and this might just be a bug) I was unde rthe impression that if you memorized the elements needed for a certain spell, you would not have a cooldown. This however didn't work for me, and I feel like, even if not the lack of cooldown there should be some kind of "reward" for queuing up the right elements instead of mashing 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI love the addition of artifacts. it allows you to play the game in so many different ways. I haven't finished the campaign yet, but if when I do, I can do it again with the artifacts I've unlocked, and I would experience it in a whole new way. I like the trials a lot too, though similar to the challenge mode, it sets different goals, for example defeating an enemy within a  certain time span. This further allows the game to remain interesting even after the campaign is beaten.\n\nFinally, how can you talk about Magicka without mentioning all the hilarious easter eggs? In my opinion they're just as fun as Magicka 1. And I've had a lot of fun finding them. This really brings a lot of humor to the game, and makes it that much better!\n\nSo what do I think of this game?\nPro's:\n- Great spellcasting mechanics which balances the game out A LOT compared to Magicka 1.\n- The movement mechanics. Especially the ability to walk while casting.\n- Challenging enemies which require you to find their weakness and adapt to every situation.\n- Artifacts!\n- Hilarious easter eggs\n\nCons:\n- Controls need getting used to\n- Lacks the ability to rebind keys\n- No reward for memorizing magicks\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. Although, it has to be said that Magicka 1 players might have trouble getting used to the changes. Players from Magicka Wizard Wars, will have less trouble adapting to this, however, it is still a different game.\n\nAs a player of both Magicka 1 and Magicka Wizard Wars I can say that though it might need some getting used to, this game is just as amazing as the other two Magicka games, and I guarantee you will have fun with this if you can look past the changes they made from the original Magicka. and may even come to the conclusion that the changes are not as bad as a Magicka 1 player first getting it's hands on this game might think.","May 28, 2015","true","18.1"," 72 of 116 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","72","116","0","1"

The whole point of you being a stupidly overpowered wizard was that you were up against insurmountable odds and had to cleverly find the right spells for the situation. Everything just zerg rushes you in this game and shields are useless except for absorbing a single element. All the weapons are meaningless and they're far and few between. The staffs have no actives and add very little to your gameplay. Magicka 1 would make an impressive sequel for this game. Sadly the opposite is not true. This game greatly improves graphics and somewhat improves online play. The servers aren't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• anymore, but you have to make a paradox account and you're always online, which is a con for me. The magicka system had all the finesse taken out for some reason, I'm guessing to appeal to console gamers. Now there's a 3rd row of 4 keys to worry about rather than having to memorize combinations. My friend and I stopped even bothering with other strategies about halfway through and just burned our way to the end with death and fire beams. Enemy AI was somehow notably weaker than in the first game and the game only lasted about 5 hours. I'd recommend buying this if it's on sale, or playing it if it's gifted to you.

In Magicka 2, they feel like bumbling idiots. Magicka 1 may have had overpowered spells, but it felt like they gave you as many tools as you wanted and said "here's a versatile spell system, go nuts" and balanced the game via the environment and the enemies. Magicka 2 looks like the developers thought "we made a clunky spell system, if we make it 100% clunkier, it'll sell 100% more".\n\nThe game plays like a bad console port. The controls are clunky and incomplete on the PC version - with a controller, you use the control stick to move. On PC, you click on a point and you walk towards it until you've arrived but there's no way to cancel your movement short of diverting your current action and clicking on yourself.\n\nContinuing on the previous point, it's like the spell system was watered down to make the game more console friendly. Everything feels more sluggish than in Magicka 1 - a game where you couldn't move and cast spells at the same time, and feels like it has more pointless combinations than Magicka 1 by virtue of how they altered the spell system to handle repetitions of elements.\n\nPursuant to the previous point, Magicka 1 didn't strictly encourage a wide vocabulary of spells, but it was fun to see what you could get away with. Magicka 2 just feels frustrating to 'play to win' and to 'play for fun' because the best spells for a situation are often from a tiny, counter-intuitive vocabulary and just spammed really fast.\n\nOverall I think that whoever developed this game has no idea of what they're doing and looks like they blew most of their budget on graphics that look outdated and didn't spend enough money actually making a game.\n\nI don't like change in general, but virtually none of the changes for Magicka 2 feels like it's trying to say "change for the better", and they all feel like they're saying "change for the sake of change".","May 30, 2015","false","10.8"," 111 of 187 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","111","187","5","0"

After several years of working on a new engine, I'd expect Paradox to atleast consider some of the problems Magicka 1 had faced. One of those problems include being unable to be played on a labtop/integrated graphics card.\n\nControls are wonky, and are unable to be rebound. Why change the AOE spell cast combination? It feels very uncomfortable if you've played Magicka 1. Mouse movement is confusing to use, and difficult to switch between movement and casting orientation.\n\nSpell balancing to Wizard Wars' degree was not required. Changing lightning to override arcane was a bit much. The famous Arcane Steam Beam longer exists. Instead, you can't even mix steam with lightning anymore, along with ice and lightning. Spells are also noticeably weaker.\n\nThe game is clearly meant for the PS4. Ingame options are not available. Quickcasting Magicks removes some of the aspect of memorizing certain combinations. Memorizing certain Magicks rewarded the player for putting effort into remembering a combination.\n\nIn conclusion, Magicka 2 has created more problems and flaws than Magicka 1.

If you're a fan of Wizard Wars, this game may be for you, but after I played Magicka 2, I feel that Magicka 1 will always be better.","May 26, 2015","false","7.4"," 108 of 182 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","108","182","3","3"

I loved Magicka 1, I put 88 hours into that game and this is unfortunately a massive downgrade.\n\nFirst off, always on DRM. You lose connection while playing single player? Hope you like having to open the task manager and close down the damn game!\n\nSecond, the game play is highly iterative, which is fine. I think we all just wanted more Magicka, but they've made changes to the spell system which essentially mean that not only is there less variety in terms of what you can do, but most of the spells you can create do very little damage, so you're not encouraged to experiment, which is basically the whole point!\nBecause no spell does decent damage, you're basically keeping to the same ones over and over.\nSome might claim this is balanced, but it doesn't feel fun. In the first game, a fully charged rock would blast it's way through a horde of weaker enemies but in this, it not only takes forever to charge, but it bounces off the first one! This doesn't feel fun, you feel weak.\n\nThey also removed alot of the "magicks", certain spell combinations that triggered specific effects, such as tornados or summoning zombies. So you have less variety with that as well. They can also be keybound, which lowers the skill requirement and thus, the feeling of success when you pull it off.\nSo to recap, the magic casting system has been gutted, castrated and beaten into the ground, possibly to get the game on xbox.\n\nHaving finished the game, I have to say that I'm very, very dissapointed with the lack of enemy variety. I went through the game and met less enemy types than the original and most of the enemies were cut and paste from the original name. For some reason they decided to dissapoint on enemy variety, yet remove the magicks that had really cool effects, such as vortex.\n\nI will say though, the last boss fight is pretty well designed. It played out alot like an MMO fight and even if it is a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in single player, it has good design.\nBUT unlike the first game, it doesn't test your ability to use various magical spells effectively. In the first game, you had a banished demon wizard (if I remember correctly) and if you didn't use certain magicks (lightning bolt and time warp), it was a really tricky fight, but you had the tools you needed.\nThe last boss fight in this one, is more about timing and positioning, which isn't neccesarily what I wanted.\n\nThe humour is still there, but if you're after that, I'd honestly suggest watching a let's play and as someone who played 88 hours of Magicka 1, that makes me weep.","May 26, 2015","false","10.1"," 58 of 94 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","58","94","4","0"

Just scroll down.\nMagicka 2 is awesome continuation of old, good Magicka that we (mostly) know and love. Before update called "Spell Again, Again", the game was bad in many ways. For example there was only few Magicks (spells like revive, haste etc.) and there was no steam and ice elements. That update fixed almost everything. And the poison element has been added!\n\nPros and cons:\n+Possibility of casting spells with 5 elements having a choice of 11 - water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth, fire + steam, ice, poison and using them on several ways - front, self, area, on weapon.\n+Possility of playing multiplayer with wizards from entire world - up to 4 players.\n+Big choice of robes (+ skins), weapons and staffs, that you need to unlock (witch is fun ^^)\n+Game modes - Adventure and many challenges\n+Gamepad support.\n+BEAUTIFUL soundtrack and good graphic.\n+Humor on every step. :)\n\n-No PvP mode - this hurts me the most. :c\n-Completing adventure mode for the first time takes up to 4 hours.\n-Only few Magicks (comparing to the first game, where there was 35 of them).\n\nSummarizing the game is really cool, even if you are playing alone.

This game is kind of based of the Wizard Wars engine wich isn't bad!\nBut.. pooh.. this game.. I am so mixed on it.\n\nDo I recommend it.. sorta..\nIt's still a good sequal, but it falls in the tropes of being overshined then it's prequels.\nSo let me sum up the good and bad.\n\nGood:\n-Gameplay improved. Quick spells as well as manual cast is in the game. Element combining is nerfed but still great and the game feels overall more responsive. The fun thing to do is hit a death beam with a life beam to get a big boom.\n\n- Visuals are improved.\n\n-Humor is still there\n\n-Good replayablity effort in the difficulty / custom difficulty settings\n\n-Difficulty improved by mechanics. More control means harder enemies. Nothing wrong with that. You can't steam beam your way out of this game! Gotta be more creative!\n\n\nThe Bad:\n-Game length. It felt shorter then the other one.\n\n-The artifical difficulty. Though it is a hard game. They sometimes ramp it up too ludicrious levels by simply putting TOO MUCH ENEMIES into the screen. Especially of different variatiies.\n\n-Game loves being wet. There are stage hazard but too many times are there puddles of water or rain or whatever to make you wet. This especially is annoying as enemies are immune to certain elements that combo with wet. While you are constantly wet! Wet immunity recommend or keep a water aura up.\n\n-Bosses. Though Some bosses are well designed mechanic wise. Overall they fall flat over it's ancestor.\nThey don't feel epic enough from the last one or are just reskinned enemies.\nSometimes stages don't even give boss fights.\nThe worst offender is the final boss as it is gimmicky like hell and it's almost impossible to do!\nIt involves a mechanic you never could pratice + a mechanic that was flawed.\n\n-Stage's\nStages weren't that interresting to me. The Final stage was a good idea. But other wise.. it felt a little blant.\n\nUnconcluded:\n-Story\nThe Story.. is.. well... nothing like the 1st game but interresting non the less.\nI can say this with non spoiler ways.\n"I have no idea how to feel of the ending of the game"\nIt is one of those types of stories. Tries to laugh, but.. I couldn't laugh.. something in this story made me feel differnet and think.\n\nOverall:\nI wouldn't rate this game but.. for a magicka expirence it only improves on a few aspects in favor of the others.\nBugs are glitches are sitll around some even from the 1st game.\nBut it's still a more polished game in it's mechanics.\nFor now.. I am still saying:\nBuy the original!\n\nThis one needs some patching or some DLC to make it enjoyable.\nAs for the final boss..\nIt's ridiclously frustrating.. it's not even THAT HARD of a boss!\nIt's just draining you on frustration rather then trying to kill you.\n","June 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

But just as I experienced it, the spell system was exhilarating, and exploring more of the seemingly infinite combinations kept the game refreshing. The spell effects are satisfying: if you combine poison and ice, you get poison icicles!\n\nThe only criticism that I'd have is for the solo mode. Solo play is smooth for the most part, but it can be a bit frustrating when you're stuck on one particular part of the story. They have made it so that you are pretty much guarenteed to win eventually, but the worst-case scenario is ressing, doing a quick W-A-[space], and then dying again (repeat) without causing much damage at all. It's more noticable when the enemies have health regen, e.g. in the harder difficulties.\n\nMagicka 2 is fun to play with friends.

Well if that concept were not already introduced to gaming, Magicka 2 more than fulfills the stereotype. I was looking forward to seeing what new and exciting improvements to one of my favorite games was released only to find an extremely dumbed down cash-grab sequel. Everything I loved about the original game was ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all over or completely removed. Lets name a few of those things:\n\n1.	No more combos- The experimentations and discovery of different combinations of magics is what got me hooked on this game in the first place. I couldn‚Äôt wait to see what new spell combinations awaited to be uncovered in Magicka 2. What were they? NOTHING! In fact, worse than nothing! The most devastatingly powerful spell combos of the previous game were not only rendered completely useless in this pathetic imitation of Magicka but the elimination of the ICE and STEAM elements cut in half the number of combinations available in the first game.  Ultimately you are stuck using the same 1 or 2 spells over and over and over and over.\n\n2.	Spell Duration: Sofar the longest spell duration I have seen (haste, armor/immunity, spell walls, etc) only lasts a few seconds. You are constantly having to recast which makes you vulnerable to attacks which totally defeats the purpose of buffing up in the first place. Not even an aoe rock barrier is useful anymore.\n\n3.	Protection:  Physical  armor (rock/ice armor) can be cut through like butter by even the weakest enemies, not to mention there is no weight value anymore (even though it slows you down a lot). You will find yourself constantly being hurled through the air or knocked on your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• by every bit of damage that comes your way.\n\n4.	Weak offence: Status changing effects such as cold, burn and stun may as well have been completely removed from the game. No more lighting fires and running, no more cold spells to protect yourself, no more defensive barriers, no more fun in general.\n\n5.	AOE spells have been reduced to almost melee range. Boulder takes 10 times as long to cast. Lightning doesn‚Äôt bounce worth crap anymore. Shield walls don‚Äôt do damage. Lets face it, you are stuck using beam attacks almost exclusively now, something I hated using before.\n\n6.	Shield spell: OMG, just take the damn thing completely out of the game! Enemies walk through it like it isn‚Äôt even there. Shield have 1 purpose in Magicka 2 ‚Äì to deflect beam attacks. Wow, that‚Äôs like, 1 enemy that you will ever use it against, and it isn‚Äôt even useful then since the cast size is super tiny and it only lasts 3 freakin seconds!\n\n7.	Mouse controls have been completely scrambled! This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if there were some interface options that allowed you to customize which buttons did what- which there isn‚Äôt. If this were a stand-alone game, that would be ok but since it is a sequel  you cant jump back and forth between each game without having to re-learn the controls.\n\n8.	Dumbed-down big magicks: Hot keys? Really? REALLY? What differentiated the pros from the newbs of Magicka 1 is their ability to remember and speedily cast difficult big magick combos. Now just assign them to buttons 1-4 and press once. No skill required.\n","May 28, 2015","false","28.6"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

Its gem you ask? The unique spellcasting mechanic that is. In Magicka you could combine 8 elements to create unique spells to fight with. Together with 4 ways to cast them. Death or Life turns every spell into a beam, add shield to create bombs, or use shield without it to create a wall.\n\nMagicka 2 redesigned this system with what they have learned from this games multiplayer counterpart Magicka: Wizard Wars. They have tried to get rid of the redundancy of spells present in preceding titles. They did a sufficient job, Death used to removes lightning unique feature of hopping from enemy to enemy. Magicks are available to cast directly instead of having to sequence the elements, although the option is still available and reduces the cool down timer significantly. while having to  It is all wrapped in a new story which feels much more alive than before. And yes it is still packed with popular references and memes.\n\nHowever the game is still packed with unused mechanics, quite a shame. The game never forces you to think of new spells. Enemies have nothing more than a weakness or strength. This, together with the short tutorial forcing player to remember everything in one go. Results in some unsatisfying gameplay, repeating one spell over and over again. Sadly  people never use complex combination like ice or steam because a simple spell does the job just as well. The same goes for the different ways to cast a spell, cast around you and cast weapon are completely abandoned as soon as the tutorial finishes.\n\nThis is all not to say that I didn't enjoy the game! The game is fantastic and with a group of friends turns in one of the most hectic games to date. The game stand firm in line of the Magicka series and deserves a strong recommendation. I just hope the developers figure out a way to reduce redundancy even more, may there ever be another game.\n","June 3, 2015","true","43.2"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","18","25","3","0"

( even the first one and wizards wars has this!)\n- Also linked to the 1st con: water and frost doesn't create ice and the same for water and fire whit steam.\n- Ice element is pretty much useless now, rock is almost every time a better and quicker choise\n- Weapon enchantmenst are dumbed down also.\n- fast casting makes remembering and casting magicks pretty damn useless. and the focus system doesn't help either!\n- floaty controlls (makes me alway walk into the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• water and that insta kills me)\n- Already encounterd a few annoying bugs\n- First boss uses cheap tricks to win, knocking you constanly down is not really a 'hard' fight when you most of the time cannot defend yourself from it!\n- Easter eggs are just not the same as in the previous game! the ones i found so far are just there. you don't get an achievment or a notification or anything they just simply stand there. and maybe do somethign when you talk to them\n\nEDIT:\n- A lot of the deaths i encounterd in the game was cause by knockback monsters flinging your charachter of the brige/screen. the secodn level is the best example of this: smal briges riddelt with monster that kamikaze to your character knocking them off the brige.\n- they nerfed the standart spell but instead they put in OP staff that pretty much give the same effect as the steam lighting spell did in the original but with less button presses\n- No more staff specialities, no liberty grenade no aura, no elemental aura. all the items have passive bonuses, with this staff you do more fire damage with this staff you do more cold damage. It is boring and lazy!\n\n\nPros:\n- pretty graphics\n- I do like the absorbtion aura, well that the only neat idea i have found in this game so far.\n\nEDIT:\n- much better chekpoint system\n\n\nIn short,\nit still is a solid game but don't play it if you loved the original magcika! it is just allround a better game then this game. especially if you want to feel like an allpowerfull wizard! yes it may have some totaly op spells but that just adds to the charm of the game. while this one is better if you just want to play it casually whitout thinking to much about spell combinations.\nIn other words if you wnat a great game, buy magcika 1. If you wnat a gme where you don't need to think baout anything and just shoot away buy this game or the next fps.\n\nPS: i don't get why people find his a 'hard' game the first levels are easier then the original ones. as a veteran player i just cruised trough then. most of the time i died was because i fell in the water because of the floaty movement.","May 26, 2015","false","8.2"," 43 of 74 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","43","74","3","0"

You're expected to experiment and learn magic combinations, usually by accidentally killing yourself and/or your friends. It also does a good job of forcing you to adapt by introducing new enemies and challenges which may be resistant, or immune, to certain elements, forcing you to change on the fly.\n\nI played Majicka 1 and, although I enjoyed it, would never consider it a favorite of mine. The ability to move while casting added in Magicka 2 is a huge improvement, IMO. It gives the combat a more frantic feel, and seems to increase the number of 'accidents' in multiplayer, especially when mines are involved. Many people are upset at the fact that you can only have 5 spell elements at the same time, instead of 7, lowering the total number of possible spells. I'm on the fence about this. On the one hand there are fewer game changing spell combinations available, but on the other hand I never used 90% of them in the first game. Quite a few still exist, but they're require less elements to cast and many of them have been added to a quick cast system for emergencies. It's much better for newer players to pick up but still allows skilled players to use powerful spells without assistance.\n\nOne of the things that doesn't quite seem up to Magicka 1's level is the writing. Magicka 1 was overflowing with jokes, references and gags. Some of that still exists here, but it's more spread out and subtle (I use that word loosely, and in relation to the first game). The entire world is a parody of... well, everything and unless you've played the first game you'll probably miss some things.\n\nWhen you plan to play Magicka 2, you should definitely try to play in a group. You CAN play solo, but half the fun comes from all the chaos generated from multiple players scrambling over each other to survive.  *NOTE* I was mostly playing a game with either 2 or 3 players and it seemed like the difficulty in a 3 player game rose disproportionately. May have been a skill issue, or game might not be properly balanced for 3 people, not sure.\n\nIf you've never played Magicka 1 I would definitely give Magicka 2 a try. It's not necessarily a better game, but easier to get into and more forgiving early on. I would suggest Magicka 1 veterans to try it, but I realize not everyone will like it. The changes between 1 and 2, especially the ability to cast on the move, make a huge difference and not everyone likes that.\n\nI urge those that are on the fence, or hated magicka 1, to give Magicka 2 a try. $15 less than most AAA DLC these days, and compeditive to most Indie titles. If you like it I guarantee you'll get more than your money's worth.","May 28, 2015","true","5.6"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","30","50","0","0"

The quick cast system is obviously catering twards noobs though they don't impose on better players and can infact be used in a sort of "hidden tech" fashion to allow a burst of spam casting.\n\nIf you want large amount of story mission this game will not improve on that, but it feels more varied since your arsenal needs to include more than the "EQRASR" pillars of death. Sheilds are less about forcing as many elements into one as you can and more about what is actively going turn you to mush.\n\n\nOVERALL: I think this game is an improvement but it isn't bolting off starting line, We need more levels and arenas.","September 19, 2015","true","40.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

At the begining, I found this game to be quite fun and good, even with it's issues. Such as:\n-The game feeling more like Wizard wars than the Magicka we loved\n-Spells don't feel that creative\n-Story isn't as funny or appealing as the previous game\n-Too little unlockables\n-Over all feels lacky and less creative.\n\nIn my opinion the game still has it's goods, but it's just not magicka, and it is still full of issues. Mainly those where Melee hits don't register, spells, you can't fuse them like you could, previously... (I think this was patched) But when you use Lightning and Arcane (or death), it makes a shock effect, instead of an electric beam. We loved the electric beam. Taking that away was a horrible choice.\n\nAnyway, the map feels less interactive and much more linear than the previous one. Feels ... Just less interesting, and even the interesting parts of it are just, there. "Fancy castle? Looks like old times? Feels the same as going through the beach map." They are smaller too, and the visuals, despite being good, I won't lie... It's not Magicka 1. It's Magicka Wizard Wars The story mode.\nThere are many other issues, but these are the ones I felt like I should talk about more.\n\nIn the end, I still play this game ocasionally, still fun ocasionally, but only for true Magicka fans, that were able to beat even this crappier version of the game we loved so much.\n\nRating: 1 "Death Electric beam" out of "One thousand sad Wizards"\n\nParadox, fix your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• for Magicka 3","March 13","false","13.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

There is a decent variety of monsters for the relatively short campaign.\nSimilar yet different humour than magicka 1. Laughter may vary, but I enjoyed it.\nNot mentioned a lot, but i like the method for changing difficulty by adding different talsimany things. bananas difficulty looks like a hell a lot of fun with 300% friendly fire >:)\nLots of fun easter eggs to find off main path.\nGraphics are awsome. A lot of attention to detail in every level.\nCasting while moving was carried over wizard wars. 10/10 would kite again. Opens up new strategies, but came with a longer charge on projectiles.\n\n\nCons\nCampaign felt kind of short and wasn't as convuluted and strong as magicka one. With that said I will probably play through it multiple times at different difficulties with different people. (just completed a solo run). (also the unlocking of new items, and challenge levels give the title a little more meat to chew through).\nJust like Magicka 1 the expansions will probably all be paid dlc, which sucks.\nThe higher level magicks are given a coolsown, andcan be activated through a button. You can still qeue elements to cast the spell, which effectivle gives you more spells on your hotbar and can be faster or add more of a challenge. The cooldown is honestly short enough where I didn't notice it (except for revive) but I rarely used magics in either magicka.\n\nOther comments\nThe spell system changes for magicka 2 are not as big of a deal to me as made out by other people.\nThe big difference is you cant combine steam and lightning or ice in the same spell, so comboing spells is more important now than finding your favorite op spell.\nThe companions don't get in the way and are basically only there to revive you. Solo run became a lot easier when I realized I could revive them after they used up there rivive on me.\nThere is this one battle early on with a jamming song replayed in the credits, best part of the game. I wish the song and the battle lasted forever.\n\nI can see how other people might be dissapointed by change, but I'm not.

I mean, you can still create them, but instead of displaying as a steam, or an ice icon within the element chain, they don't change. They remain as the elements that would usually combine to form those elements. Meaning it takes up more than one slot within the chain, and rendering both elements pretty much useless.\n\nFeedbackFeedback? Feeling of force? What's that? Magicka 2 hasn't got a clue apparently! Remember in Magicka when you could charge up a hefty fireball and you would just know it was going to be crazy powerful? It doesn't feel the same way! You don't get any recoil from casting powerful spells. It's pretty crazy how something so seemingly minor can have a massive impact, but it really doesn't feel anywhere near as good as Magicka.\n\nBalanceEnemies feel incredibly imbalanced, and spells don't really seem to have any effect or difference in damage whatsoever. I've seen many a battle where I would die, over and over and over again, and it's certainly not fun, in fact, it almost feels as if they made the enemies tougher to compensate for the lack of content. Unfortunately for them, the length of time it takes to complete a game does not necessarily mean that it has more content!\n\nResponsivenessInput lag and intentional delays are common as well. Usually it ends up like this: "Oh, I thought I added that element to the chain, apparently not. Oh there it is.", or: "Okay I'm going to cast revive now -- oh wait I can't it's on a global cooldown from that other spell I just cast". Magicka was never about hotkeys, it was always about how quickly you could remember the order of spells and chain the correct elements together, there was never a need for any kind of spell delay. I guess it's okay when there are only a few enemies on the screen, provided you actually manage to get a decent framerate, but it simply isn't as responsive as Magicka, making it rather difficult to fight off the imbalanced hordes of enemies that the game happens to constantly throw at you.\n\nThey also might as well retexture the ground to ice, because that's what it feels like I'm walking on... Admittedly, this only occurs when you point and click on the ground, and I mean while it is great fun to watch them elegantly slide to the waypoint while you spin your mouse around to make them pirouette, but seriously? I've ended up skating into water whilst casting spells at least once every level, where it permits me to, at least.\n\nGraphicsThe textures, the spells, the UI, everything looks horrendous. Spell effects, like beams and fireballs aren't anywhere near as sparkly as they once were in Magicka. Despite this, I can't even get above 30 fps, I'm actually getting lows of 15 fps on low. Taking into account that I can run GTA V on medium with ~60 fps, I'm not quite sure how they've managed to produce a game, where the visuals are worse than the original, and that runs slower than GTA V!\n\nUIThe UI looks clunky as hell too. I can't really explain it, but it somehow manages to confuse me more than it does to aid me. I'm not sure if it's the font or the colours they've used on the spell bar, but I almost have to force myself to understand what the heck is actually going on, where as in Magicka, I could just look at the spell bar and know what I'm doing without feeling confused or doubt.\n\nThere's also this new little frame-thing next to the spell bar, it displays a picture of your wizard and also flashes a low fidelity image behind it when you're affected by a particular element, such as frost or fire. I've found that this is more of a hindrance when playing in co-op as I end up seeing someone else's wizard picture being affected by an element. This then ends up in me suddenly pouring water on myself to put out a fire that was never there in the first place!\n\nNow you might say that's me being stupid, but there's more to it. It's all to do with the fact that if you're not the host, you're not the first wizard in the line of co-op players. Yes, in the heat of a battle it's pretty easy to forget that you're the second wizard, and that the second spell bar and picture is yours, not the first, and that you're not really on fire at all!\n\nConclusionCombine that all together within the final boss fight, and there you have it, an imbalanced end game that is made more difficult by input lag, intentional delays, and the clunky, confusing UI. Which is then made worse by having you repeat the same thing 5 times, and then getting to do it all over again once you die! Possibly the worst boss fight I've ever had the misfortune of playing in my life!\n\ntl;dr Rubbish.","May 27, 2015","false","7.2"," 94 of 175 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","94","175","4","2"

I prefer to write reviews based on a game's own merit, rather than comparing it to it's predecessors or other games.\n\nPros:\nThe game is fast paced and challenging in certain situations.\nThe elements in the game are relatively well balanced. There is oftentimes no catch-all spell that solves every problem.\nThe major boss fight is significantly difficult, but not punishing.\nMagickas do not need to be memorized, although it is beneficial if you do so.\nLots of unlocks and 'artifacts' to diversify your game and lengthen play-time.\nEverything is deadlier in it's base form, meaning that battles are quicker, and the game gets boring less quickly.\nBoss battles to get awesome items. Good idea!\n\nCons\nUniversal Magick cooldown. Not a good idea. Players with quick fingers should be rewarded, not punished.\nThere aren't a lot of Magicks. More magicks would mean more diversity of spells in the game.\nAll summonable minions die in about 5 seconds. They're not worth summoning.\nSome items make the Death element the catch-all spell for everything.\nThe most useful and complex spell is easily cast within 5 minutes of starting the game. It does not need to be discovered, and no experimentation is necessary. In other words, there's no learning curve.\nThe game feels 'dumb'. Everything is a cinch, and nothing is genuinely challenging until you get to the final boss.\nEnemies have access to powers you can never hope to use.\nThe boss fight puzzle's solution is thrown at the player in big bold letters. It's easy to understand what needs to happen, but the Disruption spell has about a 2 second warmup phase, and by that time the beam to be blocked is empty. Easy solution, but difficult execution. I would rather there be multiple solutions.\nThe main story is far too short.\nElements don't combine. Steam and Ice are weaker than fire, cold, and water alone because they use less elements. Furthermore, why not other combinations? Fire+Earth= Lava, Life+Earth grows tanglevines, for examples. If you're not going to give us a lot of useful magicks, then increase the diversity of ordinary spells.\nYou have to re-do the 10 minute boss fight every time you die in the middle. It requires attempt after attempt after attempt after attempt just because you keep respawning at the beginning of the 4 stage fight.\nEnemies summon insta-kill spells on top of player, no chance to save except through memorization of the fight.\nBuilt for console. Really, this game was never meant to play on a console, and it shouldn't be dumbed down in order to be playable on a PS4.\n\nCompared to the original title:\nFaster pace\nRuns better on most systems\nDeadlier base forms of spells\nNo combining elements upon summoning\nFewer magicks\nClick-and-hold healing makes for less spamming.\nFewer and less useful items and staves.\nEasier bosses (except for the last one).\n\nHonestly, the first game was a lot better. However, you get what you pay for, and this title is worth about $15. I reccomend this game for anyone looking for a cheap way to kill 3 hours, nothing more.","June 1, 2015","true","11.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I really enjoy the way which you must unlock new robes and skins for those robes, as it allows for you to "show off" to your friends your skills in prior adventures, rather than the amount of money you're willing to spend, like the first game had it. The new focus magick system is enjoyable for its convenience more than anything, though I do wish it was any four magicks rather than the "tiered" system they currently use.\n\nSome problems I've had:\n-The game is still quite buggy, (earth spells will charge without casting, I take damge from my own death spells while I have a ful death ward active, the disruptor magick won't block lok's beam sometimes, etc) but we can assume they will fix that\n-The game is extremely hard without friends (I have entered full rage far too many times, and have beaten everything on bananas difficulty except the final fight against Lok, which I haven't been able to beat on any difficulty)\n-The final boss fight is insanely hard, and truly unbeatable without teammates\n\nMost of these problems lend themselves into the category of the sillyness of the game, though, which is truly its defining feature. The fact that I am playing the campaign on solo is the main problem I have with this game, but truly that is not the way the game was meant to be played. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, but I highly suggest you get some friends to play it with and all get the game, otherwise you will have a mind-crackingly furious time!\n","June 11, 2015","true","14.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I'll give props that they fixed that issue and hell even added a new element, I played al little more and at the time of this edit I still find it to be hot garbage*)~\nMagicka 2 can be summed up in one word, disapointing.\n\nAll the mechanics work find and all of the bugs have been fixed.  Net code also works properly for once.  The artifacts seem to add to the gameplay (some may say to much) and do a few cool things.  However Paradox made some real stupid ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing decisions in the process of making this game.\n\nLets start with the elements.  ~(*IN order to create steam you need fire and water, in the old game this would make it take up one slot now it just shows as fire and water.  NOT ONLY does this take up 2 slots out of your 5 but gets rid of any synergies you could have.*)~  You can no longer add lighting to steam and other suck combinations.  Ice has similar problems.  All spells have been nerfed that are not using the space bars or hot keys.  No longer can you do some crazy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• combination.  It is all sub par, you used to feel like an irresponsable untrained wizard who would often blow them selves sky high.  Now your a sub par piece of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.  So if you want any cool spells you have to rely on any books you may find.\n\nArtifacts suffer from they are the only thing you should really know as differnet they have been marketed to there defeat. Artifacts act as a custom difficulty, you can get a certain health percentage, damage done/dealt, also there are a few good gimmick ones. You unlock artifacts by playing the game and completing challenges. Do I think they add replaybility value?  Yes, but not much.  I do have a gripe with them however.  Artifacts don't work as a slider like you think they may, but instead are individuals.  Let me explain:  Say I have a #3 life boost, that will give 150% to life spells.  In order to get a 200% boost I would need to get life boost #5.   This leads to a lot of grinding.  Though you can't get copies where you get the artifacts you want you have to figure out. IF your like me and are not a fan of certain gimics and cosmetic changes when you unlock the wrong one you just get upset.  Finally if you use a custom set of artifacts, which you can have up to 6 active at a time, you cannot unlock anything.  I can understand why that is so, but if your like me I actually tried to set the game to the most like the older one as i could.\n\nLastly I would like to mention campaign has parts in it where the combat can drag on (specifically a gate where you have to spam the same spell over and over, while fighting enemies.)  They do this a lot in the first game but it felt fun to do this you just drag on to the next level and hope it gets better, so far it hasn't.\n\nThere is a limit to the spells.  and where they dumbed it down for ps4 really shows.  The humor is ok in this game.  Some lines are pretty damn good, and the game looks great aesthetically and graphics wise.  I feel like I want to like this game But i simply cannot.  I'm to focused on how much the gameplay lacks and most of which is fun.  Great I'm an average everyday wizard who has one or two good spells.\n\nThe original game was very buggy and still is, but is extremely fun.  Anyone who has played the original should not buy this game there are so many little nitpicks I could choose to talk about and everyone who played the previous game would know what I'm talking about.  If you really want to get this game then wait till it is on sale.  It is extremely hard for me to say that a 15 game is worth less than the original, but it is.  Hopefully in the future Paradox will listen to people who have bought the game.  Till then I am going to recommend the original over this any day.\n\nPS: I hope you found this review helpful, again these are opinions and say what you will.  Also sorry if it was a bit of a read, Cheers ;)","May 26, 2015","false","9.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","1"

I bought the deluxe edition for ¬£18.99 thinking that it will be very cost-efficient (enough main story gameplay time and bonus features). However, I completed a whole run-through of the entire main campaign with one other friend of mine, and we completed it all in 4 hours.\n\nPros:Better graphics\n\nBinding unique magicks to the 1,2,3 and 4 keys.\n\nYou can respawn with found chosen items without losing them all the time\n\nYou can sort of customize gameplay with unlockables\n\nMoving while channeling/charging/holding spells\n\nMany great refences and easter eggs and all are implemented well and in a humorous manor.\n\nCons:Nowhere near enough gameplay time as I had expected\n\nNot too sure about this one - but I don't remember coming across a pvp arena like in the first Magicka, but there was the gamemode of monster waves.\n\nCold + water don't form ice, and so this takes up space in the queue for your magicks, just like how fire and water don't create steam as you cast spells. This greatly limits your own customised spells, as you can no longer do ice-shards with lightning effects as the water would cancel it out.\n\nMovement controls take a bit of getting used to (Click to walk to selected spot)\n\nEarth armour got nerfed? It doesn't seem as at all effective as it was in the first Magicka, as then it was basically extra health for sacrificing mobility.\n\nToo many waves of enemies during campains. This made it so that you were always surrounded, and with the removal of the teleport magick to be replaced with emergency teleport (VERY SHORT distance random tp), you can't get away from the enemies to charge an AOE such as earth and fire. This also stumps the players when you are barely managing to survive, so as you die while being crowded by crabs, goblins etc, you get revived amongst the group of them. This is worse than spawn killing on most games as they have removed the second of invulnerability to the player upon spawning.","May 29, 2015","true","16.7"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","0"

Too bad it has a sequelitis. At first (pre-update) it seemed to have some features missing, such as combinations of different elements. When I finally got around to playing it with my friend, it was a ton of fun, just like the last part. We played the game through on normal.\n\nThere were a bunch of references in the first part, but it's not like the game's humour was composed entirely of it. It was self-aware enough to make fun of itself for those references. Magicka 2 has a ton of referential humour and little else. It builds itself up for a huge gag at the end and suddenly the game ends. The story ends before the game kind of even starts. However, the game is not much about the story. It's about sweet spells and element combos, right? Well, we kind of already saw all of that in the last game.\n\nAt least there's a new gameplay element: Artifacts. Or mutators, if you will. You also have to unlock all of them, so you can play the game with them. Sounds kinda awful if you think about it. Play the game a million times to be able to play the game again with something being different each time. It works in a certain kind of game, but here you already have insane amounts of combinations, which you can cheese the game with, at your disposal in the beginning. Also you would be playing the game over and over. The enemies and the places you will see are going to be the same every time. So I don't feel like that would be much fun at all.\n\nNow, I want to stress the fact that I really had a great time. Also there are little puzzles here and there which are fun. However, it was definitely shorter than the last one. Get this game from a Steam sale or something, I can't recommend it for the full price.","October 8, 2015","true","6.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It feels like we're back peddling with many of the features present (or not present) in Magicka 2. The only thing I'm happy that they changed about 2 is that you have quick-cast spells. That's it. Multibeam support is nice, but kinda expected as an update, rather than worth a whole new game. It makes me wonder why they didn't just use the same engine, add the quick cast and multibeam, and create a new storyline. It feels more like what one would have expected from Magicka 1.\n\nLook, they took away you're ability to naturally push things with "wind" (no elements queued), they made charging stone take 2-3 times longer. Swinging the sword feels clumsy. Combining spells like fire and water, and water and cold, no longer fuse to produce a new element, so no more 5+ elemental casting. lighting + any element = different colored lightning that doesn't seem to do anything special. The graphics feel more downgraded and less visually delightful as Magicka 1. The loading screens provide helpful tips, just like every other game, ever, opposed to silly imagery (it feels like they're just conforming to whatever is popular, instead of being cute and unique.) Their comedy feels really dried up, just like the story. And for now, the early release of this game looks more like a fan-made project, rather than one produced by the company itself.\n\nIt lost a lot of it's unique flare, and now it's just the same old thing, but with major cuts in the features. I definitely would not recommend supporting them with this game. Wizard Wars felt WAY more polished and loved than this game. They just seem to have exhausted all their good ideas.

Screenshot of the old review here: http://puu.sh/jFzjX/e80e992395.jpg (please read that first, then the updated one below)\n\n\n[~] It's been a while since I've played Magicka 2 as I don't have any computer that can run it at a decent frame rate currently. My machine can run the original and Wizard Wars flawlessly though.\n\n[+] The recent patches fixed some of my issues I had with the game, most notably the inability to queue elements while being airborne, the the lack of a halt key and the inability to rebind the keybindings. And there will be more patches, wohooo!\n\n[~] I don't know whether they have fixed the issue with elements queuing in the wrong order.\nI don't know if they ever will, maybe it's just me. Or maybe nobody else has paid attention to it and that's why it isn't mentioned in any reviews.\n\n[-] No active staff abilities, no cool weapons. So that's still a minus. Though if you've never played the original Magicka you won't notice this.\n\n[-] Unless they accidentally forgot to list it in the patch notes, the damage numbers are still the same. Pure shield barriers are still rather useless. The obnoxious magick cooldown still exists. Wards are still very weak.\n\n[-] Ice and Steam take two element slots now and can't be combined with lightning anymore. So instead of QREASR you can at best do QRESR. For me this is a minus point not because I miss the overpowered spells but because this reduces the amount of possible spell combinations by quite a bit.\n\n[~]Lightning has priority over Arcane now, which means that you can't cast lightning beams anymore. However, you can cast arcane lightning, which is pretty cool too. It's up to you to decide whether this is a good or a bad change. I personally don't really mind.\n\n[+] The easter eggs are alright, though not as funny as in the original\n\n[+] The story is pretty alright. I personally found it to be rather predictable but I know enough people who couldn't tell what would happen next.\n\n[+] Multiplayer works almost flawlessly. But due to the many negative reviews the player base is rather small, so finding a public server can take a while if you don't have any M2 playing friends in Steam.\n\n[+] The equipment screen is a nice addition, now you can customise your character!\n\n[+] You can see your stats now - how many enemies you've killed, how many times you've killed youself, stuff like that. Pretty cool.\n\n\nPeople who are new to the Magicka franchise will definitely enjoy this game. If you like Wizard Wars more than the original Magicka, you will enjoy Magicka 2 also.\nHowever, if you loved Magicka and didn't like Magicka: Wizard Wars, you probably won't like Magicka 2. But hey, there'll be more patches!\n\n\nOriginally posted by Pdx Escher:Originally posted by Lemons w!z@rD:It is mentioned both times that people new to the Magicka franchise will likely enjoy Magicka 2 but people who loved the original might not.\nWe hear you on this, cogs and gears are whirling in the Dev team to make some changes that should go a long way to address this. :)\n\n\nHere are the links, keep in mind that they may be outdated.http://steamcommunity.com/app/238370/discussions/0/615085406654318296/\nhttps://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/feedback-plague-of-gripes.858882/\nhttp://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/only-67-positive-on-steam-where-did-things-go-wrong.858089/page-4#post-19395826\nhttps://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/concerns-and-suggestions-for-m2-and-mww.859030/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/238370/discussions/0/613957600532279163/","May 26, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","14"

I've never played the first one, so no comparisons with that from me. Apparently there was some grumbling over certain spell combos (water + fire = steam) not working in M2, but that's been fixed, and a new combo for poison was added to boot. The graphics are on the very pretty side of cartoony, and the whole game is clearly tongue-in-cheek. The humor didn't always have me slapping my knees, but it's very charming, from the pervasive nods to pop culture   ("A massive cold front is coming," says John Frost) to the option of giving your character a voice set called "Arnold" that sounds a lot like Will Sasso spoofing Schwarzenegger on Mad TV, and, last but certainly not least, the hilarious gibberish spoken by the NPCs. It sounds a lot more spirited than Simlish, and I'm ashamed to admit that I briefly thought it was Swedish.\n\nThe main draw here is obviously the clever and addictive experimenting with sheer endless combinations of various elements, which you can then unleash on your enemies (and on yourself, for better or for worse) in a number of different ways: as good old-fashioned rays and sprays, branching charges, weapon enchantments, area blasts, mines, and more. Want a fiery death ray that arcs to several foes at once, like lightning? You got it.\n\nIf the game has a drawback, it's that it's pretty damn hard, at least in solo mode. Magicka 2 was intended as a multiplayer experience, of course, and although the single player difficulty has been dialed down a bit in recent patches, later enemies come in such overwhelming numbers, to say nothing of certain bosses, that even the most adroit keyboard wizard will be hard put to survive without some assistance. Fortunately, it's easy to call in other aspiring mages. And even though they can do each other as much harm as the swarming monsters (friendly fire is always on), frustration is kept at bay through the sheer zaniness of the chaotic battles. It's a rather unique game, and comes at a very decent price, too‚Äîdefinitely a winner in my book.","November 19, 2015","true","19.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've never played the first one, so no comparisons with that from me. Apparently there was some grumbling over certain spell combos (water + fire = steam) not working in M2, but that's been fixed, and a new combo for poison was added to boot. The graphics are on the very pretty side of cartoony, and the whole game is clearly tongue-in-cheek. The humor didn't always have me slapping my knees, but it's very charming, from the pervasive nods to pop culture   ("A massive cold front is coming," says John Frost) to the option of giving your character a voice set called "Arnold" that sounds a lot like Will Sasso spoofing Schwarzenegger on Mad TV, and, last but certainly not least, the hilarious gibberish spoken by the NPCs. It sounds a lot more spirited than Simlish, and I'm ashamed to admit that I briefly thought it was Swedish.\n\nThe main draw here is obviously the clever and addictive experimenting with sheer endless combinations of various elements, which you can then unleash on your enemies (and on yourself, for better or for worse) in a number of different ways: as good old-fashioned rays and sprays, branching charges, weapon enchantments, area blasts, mines, and more. Want a fiery death ray that arcs to several foes at once, like lightning? You got it.\n\nIf the game has a drawback, it's that it's pretty damn hard, at least in solo mode. Magicka 2 was intended as a multiplayer experience, of course, and although the single player difficulty has been dialed down a bit in recent patches, later enemies come in such overwhelming numbers, to say nothing of certain bosses, that even the most adroit keyboard wizard will be hard put to survive without some assistance. Fortunately, it's easy to call in other aspiring mages. And even though they can do each other as much harm as the swarming monsters (friendly fire is always on), frustration is kept at bay through the sheer zaniness of the chaotic battles. It's a rather unique game, and comes at a very decent price, too‚Äîdefinitely a winner in my book.","November 19, 2015","true","19.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I personally like games that are difficult and require trial and error to complete, and this game delivers.\n\nI enjoy this game 10x more solo than with other people, and actually got the most enjoyment when going through the game imposing rules on myself to make things more difficult.  Complete the game on bananas difficulty without using any of the op staffs and robes you acquire along the way, only equip the standard basic robes and staff with no bonuses.  Do not use any of the hot keys for magicks, only type them manually, and do not use the revive spell ever to give yourself additional lives at a checkpoint.\n\nPeople complaining that the game is "unplayable solo" clearly are not grasping the full concept of the spell system and have clearly done no experimentation with different spell combinations.  Playing with more than one person makes the game so easy it takes away from any form of challenge.\n\nMy only complaint is that it seems like the devs got lazy towards the end of the game because the final 3-4 chapters are incredibly easy compared to some of the earlier chapters.   I felt disappointed with the final chapters recycling previous enemies and offering no new challenging scenarios.\n\nOverall a great and interesting combat system that becomes a bit too easy once you get used to the system and get upgraded staffs and robes.","April 27","true","36.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is thought up more for new people, spells have been watered down more, no more Water+Cold and Fire+Water in a single spellstack, and also there is a lack of strategy here. Of course, in Magicka 1 you were overpowered and by using your spells effectively you could destroy enemies that had protection against other kinds of elements. Now every combination with Death/Arcane element seems to do the trick on almost every enemy.\n\nThe Good parts in this game is that they finally made the multiplayer more stable, and that's actually enjoyable. It's not too fun in singleplayer, you need somebody to laugh with and sometimes be frustrated you killed eachother by crossing life and death beams. I preordered the game, I can say the ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK is worth the extra money for the DLC, it's very well done.\n\nBad parts as I said. Its a watered down game. Oh let's not forget about Key Bindings. I mean really you shouldn't have released a game with non-bindable keys, what are you? EA for quick money grab?\n\nI really had a high expectation with this game, I'm very dissapointed. But as I said, i'm giving this a chance! Newbies should enjoy it as a quick and fun game. Really great for people who never tried spellcasting action. Not worth the full price though... Just wait for a Discount. Every discount better than 25% I guess. Hopefully, the devs will change this game in better. I expect that, don't ruin it devs!","June 4, 2015","true","17.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's so un-serious it could be with all it's humour, pop culture references (swedish too) and with friendly fire on at all times you WILL be killing your teammates no matter intended or not. Therefore co-opish 'cause all of the team killing.

This takes away the fun and difficulty to remember element combinations and actually pulling them off rather than just pressing a single button to call a 5 five element combination of magick. Another thing I'm personally irritated about is the camera distance.

Meaning if you havent played all the dlcs for the first one and the last time you played magicka1 was some years ago, you will rage a lot some of the early fights seemed kind of brutal and not well paced at all ... lets talk about stepping up the difficulty.\nWe had portions where we just raged ... HARD because honestly it requires quick fingers and muscle memory aswell as knowledge which you (probably) wont have time to gain if you start from zero and are suddenly overwhelmed by waves of enemys.\n\nAlso bugs!!! we clipped through walls into areas where we shouldnt have been, the resolution likes to reset itself to 800x600 when launching the game, dont count on the game detecting your usb headset (which you probably want to use in a coop based game) and being able to use it from scratch, expect the one or other complete freeze (forcing windows restart as i didnt know another way to end the mess that was going on, looping music, my desktop blocked, constant vibrating conroller) and the one or other more or less amusing happenings which certainly were not intended by the devs (in so far as bugs arent a feature).\n\nalso the menu features a brilliant xbox360 overlay no matter if you use a controller or not (i use one but it still enrages me... its plain lazy),\n\n\nI feel they shouldve used less of their budget on marketing gags and more on revisiting the actual game because yeah there are flaws, not quite as bad as the first one but very annoying none the less.\n\nIf you loved magicka however dont let this distract you from the fact that it is FUN!

I'm more taking a stab at all sequels to great games suck)\n\nIt pains me to give Magicka 2 a negative review considering I absolutely loved the hell out of the first one! This game wasn't all bad, as there are some pretty great improvements from the original Magicka but unfortunately the few bad things in this game outweigh the good for me.\n\nFirst, we'll talk about the good:\nImproved controls:\nI don't even know where to begin here. In Magicka, the controls were fairly simple, if not a tad janky but they worked nonetheless. In Magicka 2, they've definitely worked on the system. Now you can walk and cast, movement is much smoother, more responsive, and accurate.\nBetter netcode:\nPieces has opted to use Paradox's game service in Magicka 2 instead of Steamworks like they did in Magicka but it has drastically improved the netcode. Desynchronization is very seldom an issue anymore, if ever. Latency has been bumped down majorly, positions of enemies and objects are more accurate.\nBetter optimizations (plus physics!):\nPerformance seems to have increased tenfold in Magicka 2, as Magicka had its performance issues. Plus physics has been drastically improved. Physics-enabled items no longer jump around and twitch violently, force isn't as ridiculous as it was in Magicka (but then again it was the janky physics in Magicka that kind of was part of the entertainment for me)\nSadly, here's the bad:\nThe story:\nI was not impressed, especially with all the promises made on their trailers and announcements. I, much like a lot of the Magicka fanbase, fell for a lot of the promises the developers made for Magicka 2. I figured there was going to be a long (or at least moderately long) story, similar to Magicka in terms of length. Instead what we got was a fairly short, bland, and full of humor forced upon you.\nGame service:\nIn the sequel, Pieces has opted to use Paradox's online service instead of Steamworks in the name of what I assume was netcode. While this wasn't a particularly BAD choice, Paradox's service is just a hassle, I had an extremely difficult time signing up for it at first and after much research and grinding teeth, I finally got it to work. I tried the game recently and I can't even log in anymore, for whatever reason. It just won't take.\nWeakness system:\nI'm not particularly fond of the weakness system in Magicka 2. In most cases, it really would only take a couple seconds longer to kill an enemy with normal magicks compared if you were using its weakness against it. Sure, while you could argue that sometimes a couple seconds could make all the difference, in this game the "sometimes" is really the case. Except it's more seldom.\nMutators or "artifacts":\nThis is another system I'm not particularly fond of. The mutators or "artifacts" didn't really have anything that spiced up the gameplay in an interesting way for me. It just felt boring or annoying.\nMagicka 2 was a game I overhyped the hell out of once I heard it was announced. It was a sequel I hoped and prayed for once I beat Magicka and finally my prayers were heard. I followed news religiously, watched their trailers (I love their musical trailer with Vlad even to this day. I'm listening to it right now), I screamed in absolute joy as the release date neared.\n\nFinally Magicka 2 was released. Like a giddy child on Christmas day, I launched Magicka 2; excited out of my mind as Steam installed the prerequisites. The game launches, intro videos play, then we get to the menus, asking me to sign up for a Paradox service. I was slightly confused as to why they would swap to their own service instead of using Steamworks like Magicka, as it was certainly convenient. Though I pretty much came to the conclusion it was because of netcode. Right off the bat I'm having to fight the account creation to create my account with repeated failures, cutting into the time I could be using to actually play the game when my brother seemingly got it to work without difficulty.\n\nAfter some research, teeth grinding, and anger, I finally got my account set up and ready to play. My brother and I join each other and the adventure begins finally! Without spoilers, we played the game for about two hours before we beat the campaign. Sure, there was stumbling at first as we attempted to get the hang of the new movement and casting system (which was a huge improvement over Magicka) but once we got the hang of it we breezed through the game.\nThe campaign its self was fairly interesting, though once we got over our excitement we could see it was rather boring; the world felt extremely linear, "puzzles" were overly simple or lacked entirely, the humor was foisted upon you instead of discovering it like in Magicka and thus lost its charm. Creativity was not encouraged in the slightest because even enemies with weaknesses could be killed almost as easily without using their weakness so there was little point to the weakness system.\n\nIt was heartbreaking to play a second time. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, get more robes, mutators, or to even try the arenas. I was already done trying to find some redemptive property of the game to justify what the game lacked so much that the first one had. Part of me wants a Magicka 3 in hopes that they'll carry over the good they've done to the game and correct the wrong but part of me hopes that they never touch the idea of Magicka 3.\n\nWhile the game was a disappointment for me, that's not to say that others can't enjoy it. If you enjoy it, by all means please do! I looked at the reviews before I wrote this and it seems some opinions are changing with a recent spell rebalance but that doesn't fix a majority of issues I have with the game.\n\n(how do I end reviews?)\n\nI will link my favorite trailer when Magicka 2 was in development. While I was disappointed with the game, I am not at all disappointed in this kareoke singalong trailer with Vlad\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLqkAFnm-c0","April 8","false","3.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","0"

Did we forget the release of Magicka 1 already? There were a few bugs here and there, but they were fixed pretty quickly. (Crash to Desktop lol.)\n\nThis gets a positive review from me, simply because you can obviously see the improvements.\n\nIs it a problem we can't rebind keys? Duh. Are they going to fix it? Duh again. (Probably.)\n\nAs for dumbing down... eh. It's not THAT dumbed down. You can still do insane combos like IceShieldDeathDeathDeath (woo for exploding ice blockades!) And really, the super steam-beam (you know what I'm talking about) was broken and made things a little easy.\n\nThe quick bar isn't necessary. but allows for babies first combo to work. Not everyone wants to be a try hard and spend a few hours learning some combos to look fancy. However if you learn to use the magic manually, you can spam just like the good ol' days. (I still need more zombies!) With about a 1 second cooldown.\n\nTo those of you booing them for making the sequel and the small problems saying they "disrespected the fans and made it for the people coming from wizard wars!", I don't see the problem. It's not like it was bad.\n\nGive it time, friends. Noones perfect, but they can improve.

From the models, to the scenery, I think it was well designed.\n-The improvement upon the beams from the first game makes the game infinitely better.\n-The ability to select your staves and weapons before the chapters is top notch, because losing that good staff was always a hassle in the other game.\n-The lightning looks much better in this game.\n-BEING ABLE TO MOVE WHILE CASTING SPELLS.\n-Being able to unlock robes.\n-Controller-friendly controls.\n-Very good sense of humor.\n\nCons:\n-Charging times for rock-based spells.\n-Water/fire and water/cold do not mix to create a single-slot element anymore.\n-The chapters are short.\n-"Push" is a spell now, and not a neutral ability when casting nothing.\n-Robe colors are unlocks.\n-Challenge mode is really difficult. (Granted, I'm very bad and it's called "challenge mode" for a reason, but literally dying within the first 5 seconds of the game is a bit ridiculous.)\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game because it's a lot of fun to play with a few of your buds, and even by yourself.\nThough the game has it's little quirks, it's still pretty well done.\nNow let's just hope they don't come out with 50 DLC packs like they did with the first game.","May 28, 2015","true","9.5"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","2"

The main difference is that in Magicka 2, you can move while casting (and you are slowed less by conjure weight), so a good number of fights are about casting spells quickly while constantly running around.\n\nThe writing is about as funny as the first game, with a number of subtitle jokes and a handful of callbacks sprinkled throughout what is mostly original jokes.  The plot also bears a second playthrough; while I got most of the "between the lines" story my first time, I noticed little details on my next playthrough.  Not because it's insanely convoluted with time travel like the first game, but because they're subtle little details that are only noteworthy on the second go-round.\n\nOverall, I like the game a lot, though it took me some time to get used to the idea that it's very like Magicka, but not Magicka.

The game is awesome! I read some people complain about steam or ice elements. I don't know how that worked before the patch as I got the game recently but the major differences I noticed are:\n\nNew element "poison" combining Q+S.\nYou can move while casting!\nYou can put magicks in a hotbar and cast them with the press of a button.\nMagicks can also be casted manually with a smaller cooldown.\nThe barrier element (E) doesn't stop physical projectiles anymore.\nUsing barrier + element doesn't make you insta-immune anymore. Instead there are 4 levels of protection ranging from resistance to damage absorption.\nAs of the moment I write this, robes aren't OP. Thet can be either cosmetic or a balanced mix of buff and debuff.\nEnemies have element weaknesses and/or resistance as well as players using some robes.\nThe game adds multiple difficulty levels, play on BANANAS setting for Dark Souls like experience.\n\nConclusion: game is way more balanced for PvP and the campaing with difficulty settings is more challenging for players that take Magicka way too seriously.

Magicka 2 shines with its expansive and versatile spell casting system and depth of skill one can achieve within it. It is welcoming to newcomers; most basic spells are effective enough to get the job done and deliver a very awarding experience, but also allows for those who want to poke in farther to dive in, experiment, die, learn, die again and receive the full bag of fun Magicka 2 has to offer, especially if you bring friends along. For users of the original, recent updates have returned the "controled chaos" that the first Magicka brought to us, with a bit of rebalancing to allow for a more interesting experience, whether cooking mobs in powerful storms, whacking bosses with a super-charged mushroom, or launching creeps (or friends) sky-high with a blasting wave. As in previous titles, the game does suffer from various bugs (though anything game-breaking has since been patched), as well as having repetitive moments once the initial campaign is completed, but still offers hours of awesome spellcasting and friendship-crushing moments for a rather low price. All-in-all, Magicka 2 serves as an underrated and excellent game that's a must-have for those who, with their soon-to-be ex-friends, seek a one-of-a-kind spellcasting adventure. 9/10","January 20","true","273.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course we had the Wizard wars, which really wasn't for me, but not an actual "bad game". I think we all wanted A magicka similiar to the first one, unfortunately we didn't.\nFor me it was a certain features from magica 1 that I really enjoyed and loved, features which made the game to one of the best I've ever played. But it feels like the company took all those fun features and threw it down the well.\n\nFirst, the movement system...Sigh...Theoretically the system is good. But when it comes to gameplay, not that much. It feels like you are floating over the map instead of moving, it's very easy to go further then you wanted. I think the movement system from magica 1 is perfect for the game. And it would have worked a lot better in Magica 2, much better then the new system. I can understand that the new system alows the player for a more "tactical" gameplay because you can move towards one direction while facing the other and aiming you spells. It's not that great in action.\n\nThe second and the absolutely worst change according to me is the magic system...I love the feature in the first game where you had to combine elements to create spells. Sure you can still use the elements to cast the spells, you don't have to use 1-4. But it feels like the creators just tried to throw something at the fans from the first game, because this system is not what old magicka fans wants. We're told that if we use the elements to combine our spells there won't be any cooldowns...Yet i find a 2-3 seconds window before i can use the teleport spell, even when I'm combining the elements. So I don't really know why the game tells you there won't be any cooldowns when there clearly are. And Why would you ever implement cooldowns? It just seems like the badest idea the developers could possibly imagine. Games today are so obsessed with cooldowns. Why limit the player? because of balance? I personally believe that cooldowns ruin gameplay, sure when it comes to MMOs where server lag is a big part I can understand why they implement such a system. But when they do it to a 4 player coop game....? just WTF.\n\nIn Magica 1 I felt like a powerfull wizard whith unlimited power who could just spew out spell after spell after spell and slay my enemies after desired fashion. In this game I feel more like a weak apprentice who can't do ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• for damage. I wanted to complete the game but I just couldn't, I didn't enjoy it at all. I got to the beginning of chapter 3, so I don't know which spells that will be presented to the player later in the game. But when the system is fundamentally flawed, I don't even want to know. Something I found very odd in this game is that my sword seemed like a more effective damage dealer then just my basic elements....I think that's very very weird for a game that portrays a wizard, a game which is all about magic.\n\nI could take about the flaws of magica 2 for hours, but I'll end with the item system. In magica 1 what "items" you had didn't really matter, it was all about the magic. Something I thought was very cool because of most games today is super obsessed with the idea that the item makes the character, not his abilities. That's one part of what made Magicka 1 so great in the first way. So why the obsession with "gear" in this game?\n\nI can just say I'm really disapointed in this game, and on the developers. I know they try to make good games, I just can't understand why they'd remove the fun part of the game...I hope next game is better! (but just don't make another magicka game, I'll never buy one of those again)\n","May 27, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Overall the game feels really bad and I will try to explain why.\n\n1. Story\nThe story of Magicka 2 is there but it doesnt really set in. In Magicka 1 they take their time to tell you the story and after each level you get these nice little scenes in the book where Vlad speaks to you. Magicka 2 has none of that, the story just gets told on the go in a blunt and shallow manner that makes your journey to save the world (again) feel like doing some sort of boring sidequest you wouldnt even bother to read what its plot is. The ending of the story is also very anticlimatic and doesnt feel like you finished the game at all. The story starts slow, doesnt build up, misses a climax and then just ends.\n\n2. Combat\nCombat in Magicka 2 is fast paced and action oriented. Sounds like fun but it really isnt. Casting spells is a major part of the game since they have this unique element system but you dont really have the time to enjoy it. Almost all enemies in the game are really fast and come in numbers, they will surround and kill you unless you cast defensive spells but that will just buy you time. AoE works in the beginning stages but later on with harder enemies they will just outdamage you.\nSo what to do? Magicks. About 80% of all my castings in the game were Magicks, as they can be done quick with the new quick-cast for Magicks and some of them are ludicrously strong and will finish off all enemies after 2-3 casts if you use the right ones. Also you will have to teleport a lot.\nSo instead of using this great combinationsystem with the elements you just spam the numberkeys 1, 2, 3 and 4 and use a shield or healing element occasionally to stay alive.\n\n3. Enemy Design\nThe enemies in Magika 2 feel too fast and too strong, the elemental resistances some of them have are understandable but there are some questionable/random resistances. Some enemies have annoying attacks that are hard to avoid unless you teleport.\nBosses are in the game but they feel like unimportant Minibosses. The music, their appearance and their mechanics dont quite generate the feel of a bossfight. There arent that many too and some of them appear repeatedly.\nThe last boss is also very boring and either a pest or as easy as killing a single goblin. Nowhere near Grimnir and Assatur.\n\n--\n\nI love Magicka and I really wanted to like Magicka 2 but after the first level I was already thinking "Just play through it quickly so you can put it aside forever" since the combat was unenjoyable and the whole game just felt boring.","May 9","false","5.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To play the campaign was enjoyable yet disappointing compared to the original Magicka, which had some enexpected twists and turns and had a much more fleshed out world. The references gets a little bit old, and I expected much more from the story. The gameplay is quite slower and easier, which I dislike. The spell system has been reworked for the worse, with far fewer viable spells and only one good AOE spell, you only can do when you have a teammate, which would be OK concept if there were more than 1 of such spells. But the artifact system is great but could have been made more interesting, here I am comparing it with "The Bastion" which has a much similar system where you pray to "gods" that grants gold/xp bonuses to you but makes the enemies stronger in some specific way, or you weaker.

Now the aoe version of it and the wall version of it is the same thing, weak and allows you and other players to pass, this was a really disapointment as we as a team use the shield to cover up then some would teleport out to deal with the problems and that was team work.\n\nHealing: Seems to be quite weaker.\n\nThere's a new thing that casts the spell onto your sword and then you can use it, it's interesting but due to forcing you to first cast it on sword and only then throwing away it's not much of an in-time cast and it's annoying.\n\nComing from magicka 1 and it will feel like a slightly different for the bad side and the good side, but some changes that were probably to "balance" kinda made it crappier.\nComing from any other game it's an amazing game that is tons of fun-\nComing From Wizard Wars (without playing magicka 1) the game rocks and it's so much better.\n\nSo yeah overall the game is fun as hell, however some of the changes i'm not really fan of, never played this or the first one with the controller, so i cannot provide feedback on that.\nBut yeah, i also think that some of the features feel wizard war-ish which is too simplified.","May 27, 2015","true","19.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Although, WW felt like it dumbed down the spell variety considerably compared to the base game of Magicka. This game tries to simplify (I think) the gameplay from the first and it ends up feeling like a mix of Wizard Wars and Magicka's playstyles. There are definitely improvements, for example, the more responsive middle mouse button but it still doesn't feel better than the first game's controls. Oh and it sucks that you can't combine to make ICE anymore. It's cool that you can move while casting now which makes soloing the game easier but the movement can feel really floaty at times or that your character is sliding around on ice so again it doesn't feel as good as the original. It seems they tried waaay too hard to cater to the console crowd.\n\nHowever, despite these complaints. I believe the game stands up on it's own and is still a great game. Honestly, it feels a so different from the first one, it's hard to really compare it indefinitely to the original. The humor is still humorous, the story is still good, and there are plenty of outfits and unlockables to be found throughout the game... Seriously, I can't get over how much there is to find in the game... from one liners and pop culture references just as hilarious as you would expect and new weapons and staffs dot every single chapter I've played so far.  Another nice touch, is the Artwork for every cutscene and the improved graphics... not that the other games were ever lacking in that department.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this game and can already see how much fun it's going to be playing with friends. Now I've gonna go blow up some Yellow Wizards.","May 26, 2015","true","6.7"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","15","28","7","0"

I've wanted Paradox to base their Magicka game with the style that Wizard Wars brought. Magicka 2 definitely reflects it pretty well.\n\nMy only quarrel with this game is that it's short. It's meant to be replayed, however, because there are difficulty settings for each of the 9 chapters.\n\nNotice that my quarrel with this game isn't the "dumbed down" spell casting. Admittedly, at first I thought it was very casualized, but then I started thinking about the first game, and how I only EVER used the one OP spell combo (FQASA). There wasn't ever really any reason to not use it, save for a couple of enemies using a lightning ward.

Magicka 2 had so much potential, and although the humour is still there, I feel as though the game play has suffered from Over-simplification. In my opinion the game seems to be more catered towards console gaming. The Odd movement, the dumbed down casting, and poor menu options just don't do it for me the way the original magicka did.\n\nIn the original magicka you hold down the mouse button and release it to stop moving, i loved that, no reason for change. But in Magicka 2 you click to move, and don't stop moving once you release! It's like playing the entire game on ice, hopelessly sliding to your demise.\n\nThe spell system was perfect in the original, but now you can't perform all the cool spell combinations you've memorised, Arcane and lightning don't work the same way, and WHAT HAPPENED to charging up projectiles, JESUS.\n\nNow, these aren't going to be an issue for everyone, I'm still gonna play it. It's an OK game, Just don't go into it thinking it's just a continuation of Magicka.\n\nTL;DR   Looks like a Mobile game, Plays like a Console game, and REALLY could use some fine tuning in terms of controls.\nI Rate it a 4/10","May 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is fantastic, and a great prequeal to Magicka.\n\nIn Magicka 2, you need to save a prophesized child, Lok, from the Orks. To do that, you must find and use a spell that not even Lok can defeat, to weaken her, so that you can take her safely, so that the Orks don't get her first. It is a really great game, and the Co-op is good as well. For anyone who has played Sanctum 2, Magicka 2's Co-op is similar to Sanctum 2's. You can make a public, friends only, or private server. A public server means that anyone, anywhere can join, which can be helpful. The other two modes are self explanitory. The spell system is similar to Magicka's. But, the weapon system is different, for each staff and melee weapon you find, will be saved to your inventory at the main menu. Same thing with robes.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game, and I was shocked to see it at mixed reviews. However, I can see why people didn't really like this game. It does, yes, feel more like a prequeal to Magicka: Wizard Wars than to the first Magicka. However, I do recommend this game to everybody, because, despite the reviews, this is a really good game.","January 3","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I booted up the game, preparing for a mediocre game. It was amazing. Even the menu screen is well done. Rather than a still picture or a looping video, this was a 3D overview of the realm of Midgard, complete with a comicly oversized ferris wheel and undersized mountains. As you mouse over the different options in challenge mode, the background changes to suit this. Going to battle Orcs in the Highlands? The camera pans over to them. Planning on fighting goblins in the castle of Aldratraz? The ruins rebuild themselves. Although little touches like these make no difference to the gameplay, they make the game feel more... fleshed out. The summoning and casting of spells is awkward at first, but it soon becomes natural, and their's nothing more satisfying than you and your friend combining a life and a death beam to create a miniture black hole. Couple this with great background music and the ability to play multiplayer on one PC (If you have a controller), and you've got yourself, in my opinion, a perfect game.\n\nGameplay: Kill yourself (Over and over)\nA defining part of the Magicka franchise is the ability to create your own spells, resulting in a playstyle perfect for you. Here's a good example. Before I fight, I always selfcast Sheild-Stone-Stone-Stone-Stone, which gives my wizard a suit of rock armour. Next, I move so the enemies are JUST visible on the edge of the screen. Then, I summon Water-Cold-Death-Death-Death, and hold right-mouse, which charges up the attack. After a couple of seconds I let go, firing 3-5 shards of ice, infused with death magic. Then, depending on the situation, I either cast Cold-Water-Cold-Water-Death and right-mouse charge, which does the same as the previous spell, except it shoots 7-9 shards that do less damage. In all honesty, it's like a shotgun. If their are too many enemies, I summon Lightning-Death-Fire-Death-Lightning, and Shift-middlemouse cast, which sends lightning bolts in all directions, which do extra damage (Death element at work) and light the enemies on fire.\n\nMusic: Your ears with thank you\nI can't even begin to describe how good this music is. Just listen to preveiws of it on iTunes  here [itunes.apple.com].\n\nThanks for reading this reveiw!","July 3, 2015","true","25.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can also cast magicks without the long focus cooldown if you know the element combination. This time the game also doesn't crash that much.\n\nComplaints:NOT ENOUGH MAGICKS. Magicka 1 had like 30+. This game barely has 15. Most of them are pretty underwhelming as well. e.g the Thunderbolt does like 800 dmg. It's literally better to cast AOE with the elements used for the thunderbolt, because that does 1200+ dmg... in an aoe.\nEven if I use the element combination to cast the magick, it still has a 3 second reload cooldown. Always. Look devs, with the 1st Magicka you proved that the game can be hard even without cooldowns and therefor cooldowns are ultimately a bad mechanic that just remove the fun from the game. In Magicka 1 you could go crazy with the magicks and still die.\nConsole controller UI. C'mon, all of us here use a keyboard and mouse.\nIce is OP. Ice walls are as durable as earth walls AND refelct lasers, like the pure Shield walls.\nIce walls with Death element don't explode anymore. The QREASA combination from your sword is pathetically weak, because the ice doesn't explode anymore. The Ice was often used offensively in Magicka 1. Now it's the ultimate protection, leaving earth and shield walls useless compared to to Ice.\nYou can't stack the pure Shield walls on other walls. Casting the Shield wall where and Earth wall is will replace it, not stack on it.\nHighround advantage is too big. Enemy on highground can drop down projectiles on you, even if you are behind a wall. The walls should be a lot higher, OR allow us to aim lasers and stuff on highground.\nI like what they did to the pure Ice shard, continuously firing them is cool, but I don't like how they removed the DQRQRQRS "Morning Star" combo. I liked my spikey balls :( This time, if you combine Ice with earth, it will fire the ice shards quickly as you charge up force, like pure Ice does in the 1st Magicka.\nNo fall damage from Water explosions. Water balls and water walls were often used to knock around the enemy.\nPure AOE casting is not big enough. In the 1st Magicka a 5x Water AOE cast almost covered the entire screen and was good for getting light enemies off of you. Now not only the AOE is reduced, but the force of the knockback as well. The Push Magick doesn't quite replace this, because it only works in 1 direction, not all around you.\nOn the bright side, I like what they did to the movement and the emphasis on the "Don't cross the beams" combos.","October 31, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swixel/recommended/238370/","swixel","Swixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swixel/","1449 products in account","The Magic 2 tagline of "Learn to Spell Again" is absolutely right.\n\nThe tl;drFor these post-literate times consider the following statement of brevity: it isn't Magicka, but it follows in the universe, playstyle, and is enjoyable provided you don't try to MAKE it Magicka.  You're a wizard, you have spell combinations, Magicks, and the narration by Vlad is, well, Vlad.  There are puns, some aren't painful.  If you like the style of game and want to play it, it's fun, but it is harder than the original.\n\nThe BadIf you picked up this game to follow on from Magicka, you'd be disappointed.  If you, like me, weren't a fan of the Wizard Wars (something something no local servers for too long then why bother after that?), you're not really missing a huge amount of the lore, but there are other, larger, issues.\n\nI don't like anything on the bitsquid engine.  It comes from weird input issues (and no, I don't blame Lua for this, as I know it's used elsewhere absolutely fine).  The SHIFT key will/won't be down when you need it to be/not to be.  Things like that, minor things.\n\nThe controls are different and at present you cannot change them (though we're meant to get that soon).\n\nMovement changed (left click is "go to where I clicked"), so all spell combinations changed to suit (and it's good/bad; when you play with the "Banana" set of artefacts it actually makes no sense that it changed).\n\nElements no longer combine in the spell bar (see this in 'The Good' below, as it's actually positive).\n\nMagicks are mostly 'gone' (see below).\n\n\nThe GoodThe game picks up some time after Magicka.  The story is there, you murder people (or help them), you interact with objects, the animals are made out of wood, and Vlad takes you down the wrong path (not literally this time).  Everything is as it should be in terms of lore and backdrop.\n\nThe spells have LOST a couple of combinations because elements no longer combine in the bar to form new elements (cold + water = ice; fire + water = steam), which means many of the old spells are flat out gone (due to neutralising opposites).  Despite what many have said, I find this positive as it means casting the magicks manually became cleaner.\n\nThe Magicks have changed (most are gone, the times, they are a changing/have changed).  Your reliance on spells and equipment is heavier.  This shifted the focus away from rapidly spamming (or worse, scripting) the input for, say, lightning bolt.\n\nThe Magicks also now have cooldown related functionality ("focus"), which impacts the "quick magicks" (bound 1-4) as well as those you cast yourself.  This is largely a non-issue unless you're playing with custom artefacts, or on Hard/Banana.  This seems bad at first, but ultimately it's used to mess with difficulty in a less than obvious way (e.g. try the final Adventure Trial, good luck using what you need with what you want).\n\nThe Bottom LineYes, I've finished it with the Banana artefacts.  Yes, I've finished the trials with the banana artefacts.  I'm not some "hardcore" type that finds brutal, over the top, violence, or insta-killing fun.  The banana set really did turn the game into that towards the end (last 3 chapters), and made the final boss an absolute pain.  But, all of that said, I'd still recommend it for anyone who likes a more casual-sided RPG without the need to "grind".  Granted, that very grind is replaced by items you equip instead of having to find throughout the game (though to unlock some you do literally have to find them).\n\nIf you're looking for a new Magicka, this isn't quite it; if you're looking for something similar, in the same universe, with the same style of jokes, an array of puns, and an updated visual style to go with actually functional netcode, this is probably what you want.","May 28, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Played on linux, the game is absolutely solid. I've experienced no issues whatsoever and the gameplay is a delight. The story is engrossing as well, if a little silly (but it's Magicka, so that should be a given.)\n\nThe magic system is rather fluid and intuitive. The graphics are wonderful (and scalable this time). The music is moving. Overall a solid experience.\n\nBut above all, the developers were forward, involving, and interactive! I have never seen a developer as open as Paradox when it came to the progress of the linux port of Magicka 2. We had updates at least once every few months. Yeah, there were a few details they couldn't tell us, but what they could, they did. When there was a working version, we heard about it. When there was a beta version, we were notified. When we could even PARTICIPATE in said beta, we were instructed how to get to it (which is when they got my money). They explained their reasons for all the systems they used.\n\nRegardless of how good the port is (and it's really good), the developer's interaction and openness with the community is above and beyond expectations. Not only is this game worth full price and then some, I'd buy any and all games these guys make for the simple fact that they are amazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swixel/recommended/238370/","swixel","Swixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swixel/","1449 products in account","The Magic 2 tagline of "Learn to Spell Again" is absolutely right.\n\nThe tl;drFor these post-literate times consider the following statement of brevity: it isn't Magicka, but it follows in the universe, playstyle, and is enjoyable provided you don't try to MAKE it Magicka.  You're a wizard, you have spell combinations, Magicks, and the narration by Vlad is, well, Vlad.  There are puns, some aren't painful.  If you like the style of game and want to play it, it's fun, but it is harder than the original.\n\nThe BadIf you picked up this game to follow on from Magicka, you'd be disappointed.  If you, like me, weren't a fan of the Wizard Wars (something something no local servers for too long then why bother after that?), you're not really missing a huge amount of the lore, but there are other, larger, issues.\n\nI don't like anything on the bitsquid engine.  It comes from weird input issues (and no, I don't blame Lua for this, as I know it's used elsewhere absolutely fine).  The SHIFT key will/won't be down when you need it to be/not to be.  Things like that, minor things.\n\nThe controls are different and at present you cannot change them (though we're meant to get that soon).\n\nMovement changed (left click is "go to where I clicked"), so all spell combinations changed to suit (and it's good/bad; when you play with the "Banana" set of artefacts it actually makes no sense that it changed).\n\nElements no longer combine in the spell bar (see this in 'The Good' below, as it's actually positive).\n\nMagicks are mostly 'gone' (see below).\n\n\nThe GoodThe game picks up some time after Magicka.  The story is there, you murder people (or help them), you interact with objects, the animals are made out of wood, and Vlad takes you down the wrong path (not literally this time).  Everything is as it should be in terms of lore and backdrop.\n\nThe spells have LOST a couple of combinations because elements no longer combine in the bar to form new elements (cold + water = ice; fire + water = steam), which means many of the old spells are flat out gone (due to neutralising opposites).  Despite what many have said, I find this positive as it means casting the magicks manually became cleaner.\n\nThe Magicks have changed (most are gone, the times, they are a changing/have changed).  Your reliance on spells and equipment is heavier.  This shifted the focus away from rapidly spamming (or worse, scripting) the input for, say, lightning bolt.\n\nThe Magicks also now have cooldown related functionality ("focus"), which impacts the "quick magicks" (bound 1-4) as well as those you cast yourself.  This is largely a non-issue unless you're playing with custom artefacts, or on Hard/Banana.  This seems bad at first, but ultimately it's used to mess with difficulty in a less than obvious way (e.g. try the final Adventure Trial, good luck using what you need with what you want).\n\nThe Bottom LineYes, I've finished it with the Banana artefacts.  Yes, I've finished the trials with the banana artefacts.  I'm not some "hardcore" type that finds brutal, over the top, violence, or insta-killing fun.  The banana set really did turn the game into that towards the end (last 3 chapters), and made the final boss an absolute pain.  But, all of that said, I'd still recommend it for anyone who likes a more casual-sided RPG without the need to "grind".  Granted, that very grind is replaced by items you equip instead of having to find throughout the game (though to unlock some you do literally have to find them).\n\nIf you're looking for a new Magicka, this isn't quite it; if you're looking for something similar, in the same universe, with the same style of jokes, an array of puns, and an updated visual style to go with actually functional netcode, this is probably what you want.","May 28, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was that Magicka 2 was badly designed and was hard to a point that isnt fun or allowed tactics. There are some points we should know, I should have, before playing.\n- Magicka is made for co-op, the way enemies are so fast, and you so slow, how they corner you etc, its all thought for co-op.\n- Since I was not, and wont play in co-op, another important thing to know. Revive spell isnt useless in solo. When you die, and you will, as long as you have your familiar alive, you rez, so keep reviving your pet.\n- You can and should cast while moving. Not sure the first allowed this.\nThis already makes the game MUCH more manageable! Knowing this I couldnt keep a bad review because there is a way to play it. Its not so fun as the first, its kinda repetitive but there is a way to manage all the enemies spam. If you add a stone shield, another thing the first didnt require, you'll play this easy. And the core is the same as the first, a fun game.","April 3","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its such a shame that many issues from the original game were not only carried over but amplified in this one. I am not going to lie, from playing the game for over an hour I can tell how much the fact that the game was developed with the PS4 in mind affected the game.\n\nThe Good:\n-I know that graphics don't make a game by the cartoony artstyle of the first game was not only fully captured and encanced in this sequel. The game uses some great new effects that make the world feel more vibrant and lively.\n-The controls have been refined. The game does not feel as loose as the first one. It is easier to control your character and cast spells with the new UI that makes it easier to navigate your spells.\n-Unlike the first game, Magicka 2 uses progression to unlock new types of robes and weapons. This might be seen as a negative however it might decrease the amounr of DLC released in the future and makes the stages more challenging for the player.\n-The "Artifact System". This new system allows you to customise your difficulty by using artifacts which can create an experience right for you.\n-The Hotkey spells. Unlike in Magicka, this time around you can bind spells to hotkeys which allows for their faster cast rate. It is different and I find it a great addition as it speeds up the gameplay. I do see how this change can be a detraction from the experience.\n\nWhile Magicka 2 imrpoves several gameplay elements, I am affraid outside of game you will not have much luck. This game had been clearly designed with the PS4 in mind and therefore, the matchmaking is reduced to creating a game or joining a random one. The game lacks any sort of proper server making or Steam integration which does not work well with the lack of voice communication in the game. Unlike the first game, in here the difficulty spikes at a faster rate creating a really harsh experience for lone players in the game. To add insult to injury, the community currently in the game is nothing but atrocious, I had people join my game just to try to kill me so they could play alone, or people trying to kill me to get me out of the game. The lack of voice communication makes it almost impossible to teamwork with strangers and the community does not help. This issue was already present in the first game, with the ingame matchmaking being pretty poor however, this game makes it dozens of times worse by removing lobbies or servers.\n\nTherefore, I would say that if you have at least 1 but prefferably 3 friends to play with, get this game! You will surely enjoy it in one way or another. If its because of the humour, the spell systems or the challenge. However, if you are looking at this game as something to play alone or as a game to find new friends in, stay away from it and try the other 2 games in the series.\n\nI hope you find this helpful and contact me if you'd need someone to play with.","June 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I loved Magicka, can't wait for magicka 2!!!\n\n---> After 5 minutes of play, i noticed the stone charge up takes ages. Well okay, if it was OP, it should be changed, but then i noticed if i don't fully charge, the projectile flies practically nowhere. That got me bit upset.\n\nThen i noticed the elements which merged does not do that anymore. You can still produce steam by using water and fire, but they stay as 2 separate elements in your line. Okay, again OP things got nerfed, but same time they put away some less OP fun stuff.\n\nSoon i tried to do lightning beam. Oops, now lightning takes the priority over arcane (death), and instead i got an arcane lightning. That's crappy\n\nThen the quickslots came in. At that point i was stunned how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• thing was added to the game. I have allways thought that being good at magicka requires you to memorize some magicks and use them fast, now you gotta just push a button. Fortunately though, the buttonpress does have a CD, but unfortunately the CD is also with just using elements to do the spell, fortunately shorter than the buttonpress tho.\n\nThen i noticed the push.

It continues with the magicka humor and adds a couple new things like artifacts, unlockable staves and robes etc. They changed the way spellcasting works, regarding the elements steam and ice, which may not be a bad thing as it makes the player try new elements. However, they also changed the controls from the origional so that shift and middle-mouse button  is area of effect and middle-mouse button alone is still self casting. It,s happened SO many times to me that i would press shift and middle-mouse button but for some reason it wasn't registered and I kill myself.

The main issue for me personally was this artificial skill ceiling created by cooldown on your magicks. In the first game you could play for hours and hours and constantly be getting better and more skilled, able to chain complex magicks extremely fast. In Magicka 2... Usually you are capped out at casting no more than 2 at a time, the reason is there is a 2 secondish cooldown on any magicks you manually cast and that includes ALL of your magicks, and as far as i know, there isn't a way to turn that off. You could say this is a good thing, it creates more challenging play, critical thinking, and balance. However... all those are ruined by the introduction of Steam... Steam is incredibly overpowered and there are hardly any enemies resistant to it in the campaign. I played through hard in a few hours with a buddy and all we had to do was spam steam/lightning/arcane to win.\nNow i'm not talking slightly overpowered... this is coming from someone who has spent hundreds of hours in magicka 2, my buddy who had only played a few hours, was literally better than me because he chose to spam the steam spells and i was trying out magicks and throwing out a variety. There is also less content, no multiplayer arena battles, the challenges are the same a bit lackluster, lack of maps, less magicks that are more (balanced) as in nothing too complex and overpowering.\n\nOverall Coming from someone who spent over 100 hours in magicka 1, i would give the game a 6/10  It is a fun game itself but pales in comparison to the content and mastery achieved by the first game.","December 1, 2015","true","16.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While I'm happy that the AI's difficulty has been upped since the first game, I abhor the spell cooldown system. A huge part of my enjoyment while playing the first magicka was spamming overpowered spells after having memorised each and every one of them. With Magicka 2, you can no longer do that.\n\nOther than that, the game has been really entertaining for me so far, the storyline, humor, even better than the first game. Would probably be more fun once I play this multiplayer.\n\nEdited (After completing campaign on normal difficulty, attempting some trials and challenges on normal and hard difficulties and collecting all magicks):\n\nIt seems that the idea of having a cool down for spells is actually for balancing purposes. After getting used to the controls, I feel like normal mode is easy as long as you calmly analyse the enemies' elemental resistance and cast the appropriate elements countering them. It is no doubt more difficult than the first Magicka so take some time to learn the elemental and spell interaction mechanics. Moving around is much more important as shield spells are no longer as strong as they used to be. Ultimately, I think this is actually better than the first Magicka although I still find myself soloing most things since many people will immediately kick you from their game without even letting you show your abilities to work as a team without blowing them up to bits in every battle.\n\nVerdict: Get this game, especially if you have good friends who can play with you. Seriously, like 9/10 rating, for its price this is one of the most enjoyable games I've had in a long time.","February 15","true","11.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is simple, and seems a helluva lot less volitle than the first game.

No control rebindings.. yeaaaah -.-'\n- i looked for it, and was utterly surprised to see that this basic feature which should be in ALL games, is non-existent in magicka 2\n\n^ FIX THIS, Are you trying to leave pc gaming? or what am i missing...\n\n2.

This is only because they game JUST came out. However currently the game is on my negative list. Here's why...\n\nMe and my friend were so hyped up to get Magicka 2. We thought about more spells, more fun, and overall a better experience. When the game came out we already started to notice so minor flaws before even starting the prologue.\n\n- For one, the game forces you to use an account to play with each other. I don't like people forcing things on me...\n- Another thing is, as always with every game, it is normal for a gamer to configure his settings; am I right? I was able to easily lower the graphics to my laptops standards. Everything seems great so far! Well what are we waiting for, let's start! SOOOO, as soon as we get in, we try to heal are selves with the scroll click. It don't work. Normally, I would have no problem HOWEVER, a chain reaction starts to roll in, so stick with me here.\n- I press pause to configure my settings. I can't even configure them when paused... :'(\n- Here's where it gets worse, there are absolutely no key bindings, so here me and my friend are, sitting down trying to figure out an alternative method. (P.S if any body know one please Steam message me).\n- We give up.\n- Now I know what your thinking. THE GAME JUST CAME OUT!!!!!!!JIJ!IJ ifajijfi rabble rabble rabble!!! I understand this COMPLETELY. But, why release the FULL version, if you know there gonna be bugs and errors? Why not put the game in early development or BETA? Perhaps it is me that doesn't understand. Don't fear however, as there are MANY positive things about to back me up, but not enough atm to change my negative opinion. Get the gist?\n\n- I love the integration of having 5 elements at a time, it definitely adds on to the fact of having more spells. This make me happy.\n- The graphics and smoothness have GREATLY improved!\n- Story seems to be great so far!\n\nSo there you go folks! In my straight up deep opinion, I believe you should wait a month or so when they improve the game before you buy it, as you will have the horrible feeling of not being able to play what was thought to be a great game at the moment, in the palm of your very hands.

One.\nThis is Magicka 2, with fresh engine developed for M:WW, so there are "similarities".\nThere are Oh So Many reviews about how bad it is for not being Magicka 1, so Ill write a positive one.\n\n1. Controls: Little sloppy, true. Still, you can learn to use it and they offer a whole new set of possibilities, like casting while still running in completely different direction - saved me more than once. You are a little to slow compared to monsters, you need to use spells if you want distance and in many fights you have nowhere to run\n\n2. Steam and Ice: Electric Wall Of Death was most OP spell in the game, seconded by Spray / Ray Of Electric Steam. So they removed it, and suddenly you need to USE MORE THAN TWO COMBINATIONS AND EXPLOIT ENEMY WEAKNESS! How horrible and casual! Yeah, game is harder - but it is supposed to be hard and took time to master! Orcs too fast? Slow them down, put a barrier, wear armor. Spam < Tactic ( < Tactical Spam Review).\nThey could menage it differently tbh, morphing steam/ice into fire/cold after adding lightning. Now they are useful, but hard to combine.\n\n3. Magicks: If you want to spam thunderbolt, go play Zeus in Dota or something like that. This is again step for balance and equality. Not between controllers and keyboards, but against custom macros in some keyboards. Not fun when one can bind 10k dmg to one key. You can still use them rather fast as combinations, its like 1.5s cd, and little cast time.\n\nHumor is still there, little different but present.\n\nCamera is fine, and arena lock forces other tactics than running.\n\nOverall, game is very enjoyable, even in single.

It's not all bad but as many details as they improved as many details ever so slightly they have ruined. I remember being surprised by the fact that the color of the Rock armor changed in magicka 1 based on it's strength...well this beatutiful little detail is no more...and the absolute doomray "qfqfasa" was as op as freezing the enemy and throwing a rock at them....they fixed the rock part. which i don't like but can accept. but i don't like that the possibility of connecting fire and water to create steam is dumbed down to both stays as fire and water but it creates steam. Not a big change but takes a slot more and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s up a lot of spells. I think they tried to balance magicka2 for the PvP part...which i WOULD be fine with if it wasn't for Magicka 2 to be mainly a PvE game and it was part of the fun of the game to be able to basically oneshot everything...The sheer stupidity of some mechanics was the best part of magicka 1\nPro:\n+Story\n+moving while casting\n+stable multiplayer\n+some small details (lasering on an icd enemy reflects etc.)\n+humor/eastereggs\n+soundtrack (despite everything else  love the soundtrack :D)\nCon:\n-Casting system dumbed down\n-shortcuts take out a lot of chaos (which was basically the fun of the game) by basically putting the chances to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up spells to 0\n-too short\n-slick controls\n-interface (to console-ish for an originally PC game)\n(-buggy but i'm sure they will at least patch that :P)\n\nTo conclude: If you have some friends to play it with and you have played Magicka 1....you CAN buy it you might be able to squeeze some fun out of it but if you haven't played Magicka 1 or don't have friends.....buy magicka 1. You'll have more fun with it......I hate to say that but i am VERY disappointed by this game and it is hard to disappoint me since i generally never expect something good.....","May 28, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

I‚Äôd say wait for a sale though. There are some good things about it and some not so good things right now.\n\nThe Good:\nIts Magicka! Despite all the changes it still retains the feeling of the first game.\nIts fun with friends and its a great ‚Äúcouch and tv‚Äù game.\nThe gamepad controls are a vast improvement over Magicka 1.\nMagic shortcuts are convenient. Just 4 of them and they have a cooldown. I think it keeps things balanced well enough.\nStreaming works better.\nMultiplayer works without crashing.\n\nThe Bad:\nThey dumbed down the spells a bit (biggest gripe). This is ok for the most part. I don‚Äôt miss fire and water combining into a steam element for example. However, there still needs to be a way to cast every single spell from the first game and there just isn‚Äôt. This game is labeled ‚Äú2‚Äù meaning it should build on the first game and give players MORE, not TAKE AWAY features and say its just as good. I want Vortex and Meteors back! If not those, then I want some equally powerful visually dazzling spell combos.\n\nThe new preformed magick system is awesome in my opinion but should be customizable. You should be able to write in your own combos as you discover them. There should also be more like 50 Magicks like there were in the first game as opposed to the 10 or so you can choose from now‚Ä¶\n\nThere needs to be a proper server list. I want to see which games I can join, how many players, public/private, etc. I would also like to be able to join a level at the beginning rather than jumping in right at the last 10 seconds of a boss.\n\nNeeds more levels. There are only 9! Thats ridiculous in my opinion. I got through the whole campaign solo in about 4 hours. I understand that there will likely be expansions but there should have been more at launch.\n\nNeeds more to do. There is a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù mode but the arenas from the first game seem to be gone. I want to set up a custom match between 1-4 wizards and have us duke it out without waves of enemies appearing. There also needs to be more arena maps to accommodate this.\n\nShould have more players. I like the 4 player thing. Its nice. But I want more. I was kind of expecting M2 to have at least a few massive maps and you could play with 16 players (4 teams of 4) at a time.\n\n\nVerdict:\nOk so I wrote more bad than good. I still recommend this game. Its just fun. Its dorky and if this is your style of humor you‚Äôll have a good time with it.","May 29, 2015","true","21.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Webmilio/recommended/238370/","Webmilio","W.Œ£.B.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Webmilio/","217 products in account","After completing the game, I can say that I am fully satisfied with my purchase. It made me rage, it made me laugh, it made me feel powerful. I would and will play this game again. This game, in it's current state, may or may not be stepback from Magicka 1. It really all depends on your ability to learn how to play it. They say "Learn to Spell Again" but it's more like "Learn to Play Again".\n\nTL;DR: This game is like a child with an I.Q. of 400 but doesn't want to fully exploit it (maybe half of it). It's a lot of wasted potential, but there is still time to recover. Hopefully, Paradox will see that this newborn child (which at the time of this review only has 10 to 48 hours) has some problems and needs a helping hand. If you can get past the differences between this game and what you wish was in the game, you'll actually enjoy it. I know I did.\n\nCons :   I don't like the movement mechanic, but I do like that you can heal yourself while keeping a steady walking pace.\nThe camera is locked during most battle sections and it's not even funny.\nI really don't like the Quick-magick bar thing at the bottom left, but that might be just me.\nOnly one save game, you can't have multiple characters.\nYou cannot access the options menu while in-game, only at the main menu.\nPros :  The story seems promising.\nYou can finally cast while moving and keep moving. You are still slowed down by the number of elements you are currently "holding".\nThe loading tips don't automatically close. This could be very good for some new players or anyone who forgets how to do something. You just have to be lucky and have that loading tip instead of another one.\nIt's fun. And it's even more fun with friends.\nYou can play the entire story with four friends.\nThe developers went for something different and you aren't as overpowered as last time, which makes for a new experience, like if the magic of the land had weakened.\nThe artifact system is great for replayability and allows for customization of your playthrough.\nIt has a nice humour.\nCharacter customization outside of the game: your account has an "inventory".\nBEAM GWAFIXZ\n"This game keeps on getting better as you get better and as you progress through it. You'll learn how to use the movements properly and you'll find new combos that work in multiple situations."\n\nYou want to know why I think that? Read further, but please be aware that\nSPOILERS MAY FOLLOW. IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENT ON BUYING THE GAME (which you shouldn't have just yet), PLEASE DO NOT READ REVIEW.\n\nI start the game, listen to Vlad and his ... overly exagerated accent (worst than in Magicka 1). I go through the ruins and enjoy the tutorial, walk through what used to be outside the castle and past the dummy. I'm quite happy now and I like the new graphics. The spells look good and they make you feel powerful with the new effects. I feel like my 27,99$ CAN for the Deluxe Edition were well spent.\n\nI'm at my first battle. I try my forever favorite combo (the 'Thunder Bolt' combo from Magicka 1): QFASA. I know there is a new spell system with the Quickbar thingny, but I know I haven't learned the 'Thunder Bolt' spell yet. I thus try to cast it as a beam, but to my great dismay, I find that it doesn't work as intended. The concept of opposites already existed in Magicka 1 (Earth + Lightning = NULL), but now it's even stronger. Yes, Water + Fire = Steam, but Water + Lightning = NULL as well. In my mind, I see all the combos that fly away.\n\nSkip ahead a couple of encounters with goblins and crabs, the two major enemies at this point. I liked Magicka 1 for the feeling of being overpowered it gave you. You knew you could do some massive damage, but being overwhelmed was a big problem. That's where you used the shield and the AoE spells. Now, the shield cannot be recharged. That basically removes the possibility to take in the amount of enemies and make a strategy. Your shield will run out before you can even realize your protected.\n\nSkip ahead a couple of battles again. You fight a "miniboss" of some kind. Even disappointed as I was, I was hyped for the battle, knowing it would be a challenge. I've had relatively no problems up to this point with the enemies, but I know it's early game, which is why it was easy. The boss is big in size and has an army of minions, ready to attack you. I try to escape their attacks to plan my moves since my AoEs doesn't do as much damage as I'd like. The camera is locked and I cannot avoid them for quite long. The map is covered in water and I'm slowed down. I die. I respawn within the circle that the minions had formed around my dead body. I die again.\n\nFantastic! I've beaten this thing and it was kinda fun, except when I died for no reason. But wait... I haven't died for no reason, the game just glitched and I don't see the particle effects! I know that you can see if your on fire, wet or dead at the bottom left of your screen, but I don't look at that. I know the combos and elements by heart so I don't have to look back down. I see neither my attacks or current status on my character... disappointing, but it won't stop me from playing the game. I might just restart the game, but I'm lazy and I can just look at the bottom left, really.\n\nWhats this? Dialog?! And another big dude?!! Is this... Yes! A real boss battle! This guy is strong. I didn't know what to do at first so I just ran around in circles, but the guy has all sorts of tricks. And it's not just one dude, there's another! I die. Alright, I know what to do now, let's go! I'm half-way there, but I die again! I'll spare you the details of the fight, to avoid both boredom and spoilers, but I win. I have absolutely no complaints about this battle, other than the ones that affect the whole game (like the spell-casting system). It is well executed, balanced and the dialog before the battle has a nice touch of humour.\n\nAfter the first boss comes a puzzle. It isn't too hard to solve, but you have to fight at the same time, which is actually pretty fun. You have to time your attacks, take some chances if you want to finish it faster. The enemies aren't hard to kill a single bit, but so are you. If you ignore them, you'll simply die. They keep respawning until you complete the puzzle. This would've been a horrible decision by the level designers had the enemy not been a huge threat. It is just enough so that you can't simply plow through the puzzle.\n\nThe next room p*ssed me off. It is uselessly dangerous and you will die at least once. If not, kudos to you! You will face another "miniboss" and a couple of monsters. Basically, your biggest weakness: a ton of monsters that aren't vulnerable to every element. I like what they went for, but I think the number of enemies you have to face at the same time while in this room is a bit over-the-top and could've been lowered.\n\nThe room keeps doing and there are more enemies. Another "miniboss" and more enemies. You get used to it, but it just makes it more fun since you die less. There are more bits and pieces of dialog here and there and they all have some sort of humour in them. I'm pretty sure I heard "bootyflap" somewhere in the fake language they use.\n\nThis is the end of my review. If the need be, I will expand it as I am way past this point now. This game keeps on getting better as you get better and as you progress through it. You'll learn how to use the movements properly and you'll find new combos that work in multiple situations.","May 27, 2015","true","25.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","2"

DAMN YOU IMPULSE BUYING!!!!!!!!!\n\nUnfortunately all of the negative reviews are true. The console cancer has spread and affected this game on top of the usual shoddy coding and gameplay issues which were expected.\n\nFrom the forced Paradox login which doesn't even allow to copy and paste your password, to in game windows which do not disappear, to randomly getting stuck on screen, to music getting bugged and start playing on top of itself, to being unable to switch the controller off while in game, to non working achievements page - this game makes all of the mistakes first Magica did and feels bugged, unpolished, lacking in details and attention.\n\nYou'd think that after dozens of dlcs, hundreds of patches the last game received the developers would be more thorough and attentive but alas - its just as bad as it was years ago with the first game. It's even more mind boggling since Magica 2 was developed by another game studio. Did everyone stop testing games before release? Is this real life?\n\nPersonally i don't care that you can't combine spells in a que now. In previous Magica players either used random spells and didn't bother with finding "perfect" combinations or used 2-3 overpowered spells on macros. At least i did. And it wasn't fun. Variety and ability to use different builds is what makes the game fun. If i wanted to use strictly one build, one set of items and one set of spells id be playing Diablo 3. Which i am playing but that's besides the point. The point is - balance and variety trumps overpowered overused spell combinations. Now if only this game had the balance and variety... i mean cmon - that rock takes like 5-7 seconds to charge now wtf?\n\nWhat i do care the most about this game are bugs and controls. Yes you can use the controller now. I've tried it for 45 seconds and im never using it again, so let me switch it off and change the controls in game, kplsthxbye. No i am not going to edit some txt file, try harder. I SAID TRY HARDER! Also fix characters getting stuck and freak out for no apparent reason. Also fix music. And achievements. Then we will talk.

I LOVED the game, it was fun with or without friends to play with. Let me also say that in the original Magicka, I played the game at a time when playing the game was always buggy and near on impossible and therefore the majority of that play time was solo.\n\nIn Magicka 2, playing solo is just frustrating. The game doesn't scale whatsoever and plays the same (same number of enemies, same damage etc...) no matter how many people are in your party. This makes the game immensely difficult to play alone. You find yourself consistently dying and then to avoid death, you have to spam the same abilities over and over again and play a very defensive game which is not the way the game is intended to be played.\n\nSome particularly irksome points are:\n- The fact that abilities are now on cooldown - In Magicka 1, I loved to be able to spam ASF to use haste, it helped to create a better style of play where I was able to run to an area with no enemies, cast some spells and kill some dudes. In Magicka 2 this isn't possible, you're always backed into a corner with nowhere to run. The enemies are too fast and without added people to revive you, you will be constantly having to restart.\n\n- The fact that teleport is random - This seriously annoyed me. Teleport in the first game was given to the played fairly late in the story. It was a complete game changer! Here, teleport is given to you in the second level and it almost feels worthless using it because you could be teleported right into the path of an enemy and then be unable to teleport away because the spell is on cooldown?!\n\n- Your game is set to invite people as default - Magicka 2 creates an open game without really telling you. You therefore have to manually set the game to private in order to guarantee that you can play alone or only with people you invite to the game.\n\n- Frost and water no longer combine to make ice and fire and water no longer combine to make steam. They all just fill up the spell bar and this makes for fewer combinations!\n\n- Lightning and Death combine to make a lightning based attack rather than a beam based attack (different from the first game) not really sure why they did this, it seems to make little sense and allows doesn't allow for powerful mega death beams containing lightning, fire and death.\n\n- Ultimately, the game feels like it was made for PS4 and then they released on PC as an afterthought.\n\nThis game is hugely disappointing to me as I truly am a huge fan of the first game. I will continue to play through the game but I doubt I will be collecting everything and finding all the achievements as I did in the first game. The humour is still there and the voice acting still great, but Magicka is all about the gameplay, feeling like a powerful wizard and crushing your enemies with amazing spell combinations. For me, Magicka 2 didn't encapsulate this for me and as a result has left me wanting to return to Magicka 1.\n\nTL;DR:\nNot as good as the first Magicka, go pick up the first game and all the DLC for half the price of this game and play that instead.","May 28, 2015","false","16.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Not even single player mode. Also once lost, you don`t see any options etc, you have to Alt F4 the game & start over. This is appalling & should of been spotted before release. They`ve found the problem, but now we have to wait for the fix which will be Soon‚Ñ¢\n\nThere are some things missing that every game should have, the main one being:\nKeybinds; you can`t change these without using external software (Thank the Vizards I use Logitech mouse software...).\nIt is floaty. Unlike Magicka (& Wizard Wars) it seems like you`re just floating about or on ice, you also can`t stop yourself from moving with a key, like could in the past.\n\nCooldowns on spells: I`ve no idea why this was added, but it`s terribad & than some. Even when you "get used" to this, there are times when the spells still refuse to work.\n\nSettings; It starts the game/intro, before you can ever get to settings to change audio (which was on LOUD!! & gfx on a lower res then defaulte. In game, you can`t change any of these, you have to quit to main menu, alter them & start over. I assume it also means in party, all players`ll get kicked just so you can change the settings(?).\n\nCloud saves: I don`t use cloud on steam because it WILL feck up saves at times, but Magicka2 also uses it`s own cloud & there`s no option to turn this off.\n\nCharacter: You can only name your char` once. Whilst not overly bad, what if you have kids/wife etc & they want to play on their own char`? Welp, they can`t :(\n\nDisplay of Controller & keybinds, especially during the tutorial, clutters the screen. It should detect what you`re using & only display those.\n\nSpeech bubbles/UI hints are huge & can block the combat, a transparency setting here may help.\n\nErm...\nPro`s:\n\nIf you got the deluxe pre-order, some of the robes/weapons are reeeeeally nice, especially as you get these in Magicka Wizard Wars too.\n\nParadox do seem to have taken note of some of these on the forums, so hopefully it`ll get sorted....\n\nSoon‚Ñ¢","May 28, 2015","false","5.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It gives you a very fun gameplay,\nThe characters and jokes are simply hilarious!\nThe weapons and combats are very good coded\nWE HAVE SHORTCUTS PEOPLE!\nThe graphics are simply beautiful! <3\nStory is perfect!\nThe comedy is still dominating.\n\nAnd this is what i think of the game so far!\nFirst of all the story and the gameplay is very well done! I mean wow....This game sets the bar pretty high up, the comedy in the game is still as good if not better then in the first one, sometimes with even a couple of surprises.\n\nThe characters are very well made, detailed and with funny voices. Remember when you entered the game and the weapons sometimes disappeared including the staff, the ones you had before you left? Now that has been solved! The ''remake'' of the character choosing with colours and stuff are much better now then before, the fact that you can now choose the staff and weapon of your choice before you enter the game is brilliant (including voice changes)!\n\n\nThe combat level is really great, the idea of having shortcuts as in the MMO/RPG games is very useful and great to have right now. It makes the combats much more faster and smoother. Since it is a littlebit more difficult to survive it is very good to have a shortcut because you don't always have the time to do the combo.\n\nThe combat itself is very well made. It isn't to nerfed and it isn't to op.\nI think it was a good idea to remove the (for those who doesn't know) combo what i think was pretty OP, when you combined steam with electricity you got a pretty damn good beam and made major damage	, the problem with that combo was that once you learned it, you almost never changed to any other magic combos in combat. By removing this you're going to want to take a more strategic approach to this game compared to Magicka 1.\n\nIt has everything you asked for, the spell books which you find is very obvious, (Unless there is more spells added then before which is hidden???) The graphics are so cool that it made my brain explode, everything is so beautiful, well designed.\n\nNow the shield got nerfed which i personally think is good because you can't stand there forever and boost it up, BUT!! You take much more damage now from small creatures then before which makes it a challenge to defeat the monsters, now goblins and orcs aren't the problems. The problem is that when you find for example a larger mob meanwhile there comes a lot of orcs and other creatures it makes it a littlebit hard to survive, but once again you need to think more now to try defeating the monsters. I haven't got far in the story but so far it's really good and i don't find any problems!\n\nSo i still love the game and hope it will be just better and better, Brb, time to play some Magicka 2 <3","May 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","0"

It is based mostly on the Wizard Wars experience (a poor choice from the developers).\n\nThe most disappointing aspect is that the movements look clumsy and slow. The charging time of the spells is sooooo long that you will end up not using certain strategies at all (I'm looking at you ice shards).\nThe game is designed to be played in co-op, but it's surprising how frustrating can get playing solo.\nIt's just like the developers are telling you "What da f*** are you doing alone? Go get some friends or get lost".\n\nAs a positive note, a much needed rebalancing of some OP combinations has been made, even if some elements are just under powered now (Lightning, Fire, Steam).\nYou don't feel that great inner satisfaction emblematic of the first game,  when you set off your elemental fury against your enemies....Some combinations look very unsatisfactory and you will end up using them very rarely.\nI'm simply devastating my keyboard casting spells that end up being "meh".\nI understand that you need to learn making complex strategies, but you would expect a full powered Fire elemental attack at point blank to deal much more damage than silly strings...\nI managed to make my way alone through the game until the final boss, but a beginner would definitely not achieve the same results.....\n\nI'm not a fan of the Magick's instant-casting-button, but at least they made it rewarding for people who put effort into remembering the combinations, so is a friendly tool for beginners or an emergency button.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is still enjoyable and funny (but SHORT), but you'd better wait until they make some changes or make sure you have some friends to play with, as this game is a total single-players  hater.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nStory: 6/10\nMusic: 6/10\nSound effects: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10  (doesn't scale very well)\n\nTOTAL: 6.8","May 29, 2015","false","15.2"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

I enjoyed it immensely: the spell combination system is fun, the invented language is brilliant and funny, and overall it's a great game. The follow-up (this one) is somewhat of a disappointment. In summary, it seems like the developers made a sincere effort to address some of the weaknesses of the first game, the primary one being that once you figured out the most powerful spell combinations, it was a little too easy.\n\nUnfortunately, this effort seems to have focused mainly on the kind of frustrating pseudo-difficulty that basically consists of being overwhelmed by numbers and speed of enemies. For example, I frequently died almost immediately after being resurrected by my Familar; unlike the first game, there's no period of invulnerability after resurrection. I'm sure someone will have a way around this, but it's meant as a representative example, not the sum total of my complaints. The bottom line is that if you play this game, be prepared to spend a lot more time boiling with frustration after you die without a chance to react.\n\nPros\n- Better graphics\n- More challenging\n- Artifacts allow custom difficulty\n- Changing Arcane to Death and adding the particular related effects was a good idea\n- Having the Magicks in their own control bar and automatically gained as you advance is, overall, better than the first game\n\nCons\n- Shields over-nerfed. The problem is you spend an inordinate amount of time running around just trying to get position so you can fight back. Enemies are as fast as you and are often either unaffected by or can block Frost slowing effects. Some people might like this, but I just found it aggravating.\n- Controls changed; takes quite a bit of getting used to and I don't see the benefit. In particular, making the center mouse button involved in both self-cast and AoE cast causes an awful lot of inadvertent self-casting of harmful spells.\n- Doesn't seem like as much effort was put into the language in this one, which was a big part of my enjoyment of the first one.\n- Not enough levels in the Adventure; even with all the difficulties mentioned, I finished the game in 12 hours, and to be honest even the customizability doesn't make me want to play the same levels again.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game on its own, and I think it's going in the right direction in terms of addressing the issues mentioned. But the fun / challenge balance needs to be fine tuned and it needs to be longer.","July 6, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is based mostly on the Wizard Wars experience (a poor choice from the developers).\n\nThe most disappointing aspect is that the movements look clumsy and slow. The charging time of the spells is sooooo long that you will end up not using certain strategies at all (I'm looking at you ice shards).\nThe game is designed to be played in co-op, but it's surprising how frustrating can get playing solo.\nIt's just like the developers are telling you "What da f*** are you doing alone? Go get some friends or get lost".\n\nAs a positive note, a much needed rebalancing of some OP combinations has been made, even if some elements are just under powered now (Lightning, Fire, Steam).\nYou don't feel that great inner satisfaction emblematic of the first game,  when you set off your elemental fury against your enemies....Some combinations look very unsatisfactory and you will end up using them very rarely.\nI'm simply devastating my keyboard casting spells that end up being "meh".\nI understand that you need to learn making complex strategies, but you would expect a full powered Fire elemental attack at point blank to deal much more damage than silly strings...\nI managed to make my way alone through the game until the final boss, but a beginner would definitely not achieve the same results.....\n\nI'm not a fan of the Magick's instant-casting-button, but at least they made it rewarding for people who put effort into remembering the combinations, so is a friendly tool for beginners or an emergency button.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is still enjoyable and funny (but SHORT), but you'd better wait until they make some changes or make sure you have some friends to play with, as this game is a total single-players  hater.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nStory: 6/10\nMusic: 6/10\nSound effects: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10  (doesn't scale very well)\n\nTOTAL: 6.8","May 29, 2015","false","15.2"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Fun, but very difficult solo, so best enjoyed with a friend or three. :) Also, I correct some misinformation below that is being spread in the negative reviews.\n\nThe first Magicka is one of my all-time favorite games. The concept of pulling together elements in different combinations to create and unleash a wizard's fury upon his or her enemies is still brilliant, and retained for Magicka 2. Before going further, there are a couple bits of misinformation that are being propagated in some of the negative reviews for Magicka 2:\n\n1) The devs have implemented a hotbar system for the casting of the powerful 'magicks' with a single key press. However, this is ENTIRELY optional. The player still retains the ability to manually cast magicks by keying in the elements and hitting the space bar. In fact, the new implementation just gives different players the choice of how to use magicks--they can either use a single key press and suffer through the cooldown timer, or they can use the old manual method WHICH HAS NO COOLDOWN. I cast Haste all the time using the manual method and don't have to worry about the cooldown at all.\n\n2) Another common complaint in the comments is that the player now has to use a click to move system to control their wizard. Similar to #1 above, this is half-true. Yes, players can click to move their wizard (which allows for firing behind you while on the move), or they can use the classic method of moving their wizard which is click and drag, guiding the wizard along a path. Again, the choice is up to the player.\n\nThe humor is a little hit and miss, and the devs may have overdone it a bit (I don't need a joke in every line of dialogue). Still funny, but maybe a bit much.\n\nSo, is it fun? Yes...but maybe not solo. Solo, it has fun moments, but it is also way more difficult. I had to replay the first boss seven or eight times before I came up with a strategy for defeating it. On the other hand, the very fact that I had to think about a strategy and then execute it was exciting...but still probably more taxing than it needed to be. For best results, play with friends. :D\n","May 27, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The hotbar cooldowns are independent of the normal input cooldown, so you can use the two in tandem to let off magicks really quickly.  I understand how the cooldowns can be seen as a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but keep in mind that you get very powerful magicks from the start, so if you could spam like you could in Magicka 1, the game would be too easy.\n\nAnother thing that can be upsetting is the fact that steam and ice are not separate elements anymore, but this is honestly for the better, as the old steam-and-lightning-ray from the original Magicka made the game way too easy.  In Magicka 2 you actually have to be adaptive in how you play and use different spells to take down different enemies.\n\nAs a result, the game is much harder than the first, but I think this is honestly a good thing.  They send more varied enemies at you so you have to selectively shield yourself from different elements and you absolutely have to make use of your ability to walk an cast at the same time in order to survive.\n\nThe new system of robes and staves is also good because there aren't any overpowered robes like the cyber robe from the first game.\n\nI actually think that despite some of my favorite things being missing, this game is actually better than the first one.  The tagline "Learn to Spell, Again" is very accurate, as this game plays completely different from the first.  One of my only complaints with the game is the number of meme jokes they put in the game.  They retained their good comedy from the first one, but they added way too many pop-culture references in between.","May 28, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I enjoyed it immensely: the spell combination system is fun, the invented language is brilliant and funny, and overall it's a great game. The follow-up (this one) is somewhat of a disappointment. In summary, it seems like the developers made a sincere effort to address some of the weaknesses of the first game, the primary one being that once you figured out the most powerful spell combinations, it was a little too easy.\n\nUnfortunately, this effort seems to have focused mainly on the kind of frustrating pseudo-difficulty that basically consists of being overwhelmed by numbers and speed of enemies. For example, I frequently died almost immediately after being resurrected by my Familar; unlike the first game, there's no period of invulnerability after resurrection. I'm sure someone will have a way around this, but it's meant as a representative example, not the sum total of my complaints. The bottom line is that if you play this game, be prepared to spend a lot more time boiling with frustration after you die without a chance to react.\n\nPros\n- Better graphics\n- More challenging\n- Artifacts allow custom difficulty\n- Changing Arcane to Death and adding the particular related effects was a good idea\n- Having the Magicks in their own control bar and automatically gained as you advance is, overall, better than the first game\n\nCons\n- Shields over-nerfed. The problem is you spend an inordinate amount of time running around just trying to get position so you can fight back. Enemies are as fast as you and are often either unaffected by or can block Frost slowing effects. Some people might like this, but I just found it aggravating.\n- Controls changed; takes quite a bit of getting used to and I don't see the benefit. In particular, making the center mouse button involved in both self-cast and AoE cast causes an awful lot of inadvertent self-casting of harmful spells.\n- Doesn't seem like as much effort was put into the language in this one, which was a big part of my enjoyment of the first one.\n- Not enough levels in the Adventure; even with all the difficulties mentioned, I finished the game in 12 hours, and to be honest even the customizability doesn't make me want to play the same levels again.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game on its own, and I think it's going in the right direction in terms of addressing the issues mentioned. But the fun / challenge balance needs to be fine tuned and it needs to be longer.","July 6, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Magicka 2 *is* a very good game, but it requires an update because in current's state, it's very hard to play and enjoy.\n\nFinishing the campaign in solo is awfully difficult and frustrating : The monsters keep blocking you with earth-spells and there is nothing more annoying than to see your movements limited by a badly though gameplay. All the spells have been heavily weakened. Throwing a huge rock to explode frozen monsters is so difficult you won't be able to do it unless really lucky. The shield is worthless, it doesn't block the monsters anymore. And rock barriers won't hold more than one or two seconds, useless.\n\nYour life is much lower than before, and everytime you are hit, your inputs are reset and frozen for two seconds. Winning in solo is basically : Never get hit, never get stuck, or you are dead.

Do I recommend this game? Yes. It's an unique, adventure game that is a lot of fun with friends and the devs increased the replay value a little by adding multiple levels of difficulty to the  adventure  this time.\n\nBut I have to be honest on my feelings towards this sequel that I was looking forward to for quite some time. At the time of writing this review I have about 20hrs in game and almost 700 hrs in the prequel. I was clearly an avid Magicka player but I felt this sequel fell short of what made the original game "magical" (pun intended).\n\nLets start with the spell casting. I miss the freedom and creativity of casting a multitude of varying spells at will to defeat my surrounding enemies in the prequel. Where as in the sequel I feel limited, weaker and as if I'm spamming the same spells because not much else works. Also the Magicks are no where near as impressive as in the original.\n\nThe challenge mode is another example of "better in the prequel" and the missing VS mode is a disappointment and if Magicka: Wizard Wars is supposed to fill that void then... no thanks. I already had my fill on the sequel and not sure how much more time I'll spend on it.\n\nI understand that this game was developed for the PS4 as well. Not sure if the changes were to make the game more controller friendly or if the devs wanted to manipulate how players played their game. In comparison this Magicka has lost it's touch.\n\n----Bottom Line----\n\nMagicka 2 is a cool little game on it's own. But with it's prequel standing behind, it's easily overshadowed. Some may agree that Magicka 2 would make more sense as the prequel and the original it's sequel.\n\nIf you never played any Magicka game before I recommend this one because the online presence in the first game is almost non existent at this point.","June 7, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a very different beast, and not in a good way. Pieces attempted to put together a more challenging experience, however, the result is ultimately a more tedious and less exciting one. This is compounded by the recycling of the design of spells, spell types, and spellcasting from Wizard Wars. During the conversion, much of the character that these things previously possessed was lost. There is enjoyment to be had in Magicka 2, but so far, it's hardly what I was looking forward to.\n\nI cannot recommend Magicka 2 in this state and I will not write a fairer review, so long as the wizardry of Magicka 2 remains as is, at the time of this review. Looks like I won't be writing a "fairer" review. It's very clear to me that, since the game is in Paradox's hands, nothing that matters will be improved or revised. The elements will always be shallow. Simple spells will always be the best. Spell metrics will always be dull. Melee will always be clunky. Many spelltypes will always be half broken. Most importantly, wizards will always be a shadow of their former, Magicka 1 glory.","May 30, 2015","false","7.2"," 35 of 70 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","35","70","2","0"

RIGHT\nIn the middle of that 12 people...and guess what? You sure die in seconds, because the teleporting spell you can use, has a cool down.\nAlso there tons of bugs, you teleport, you teleport into nothing and die 5 seconds later.\nOne time we walk and the next level loaded, we spawn and the camera went to an owl...5 minutes later, that owl moved and the game does nothing,\nwe could not move or do anything.\nThis game has as much bugs as magicka 1 had...wow after so many years, they really did the same mistakes.\nAt least i don't had a crash, thats a good thing.\n\n\nSpells:\nThe spells are not as good they were in magicka 1...\nSteam was a very cool feature in magicka 1 but now, it is gone?\nYou can not combine fire with water anymore to create steam, which is very disapointing.\nA icebeam is no longer possible...\nAlso you can no longer combine some other magickas anymore...they just removed which confuse you very much if you played magicka 1.\nI hate that the magicka also disapear, you cast something and it will just gone...which makes no sense.\nYou have now "hot key spells" which means you don't have to combine them by yourself, which is the only good change with magicka in this game...\nBecause it was a pain in the a. to reanimate your teammates.\nAnd you don't have the feeling of very powerfull spells anymore, you know the earth will instantkill someone, but you don't know when you are fully charged, it was very clear in magicka 1.\n\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are good enough for a game that price.\nNo dislike here.\n\n\n\nI really, really try to have fun, but it is more "work" then having fun with this game.\nThe movement is terrible, the casting is very annyoing, because if you choose a wrong element, you can't remove it.\nYou also die to fast, enemies spawn unlimited which is pointless in the first few levels...later i would say okay, but so early...no\nThey really have to improve the game, or it will fail very hard...\n- Controlls have to be way better\n- Balance the game\n- remove the cooldowns!\n- put the old spells back and change them the old way! i want know, when my earth is fully loaded and don't took me a week to finish that spell...\n- if i put mines or a wall, it should stay and just removed if someone destroy it or create a new one!\nI would give this game 3 of 5 stars.\nI had about idk 100 hours of magicka 1 and with magicka 2, i really don't want to play it anymore, it is not fun to play.\n\nI don't get it, how company's always kill the fun with the next game.\nSame as natural selection 2, the first game, like magicka 1, was great! Just add new magicka, new enemies, levels, story and on, everything would be fine.\nBut removing the old core system is just stupid!!!!!!!","May 29, 2015","false","7.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

First one was hella fun and this one is more like a way to kill time with your friends (you wont after you play this). We usually spend at least 3-4 times longer in a zone than was intended and the main things you can hear are "hey let me do a damage check" or "SERIOUSLY GUYS CAN WE MOVE ON". Our playthroughs typically demonstrate Game of Thrones level politics and betrayal and usually end up with us all killing each other a lot. I often wonder if Magicka is a giant social experiment to see what happens when a human has elemental powers and the ability to revive his friends, in most cases the answer would probably be global ahiniliation and rebirth.\n\nI dont seem to hold the venom towards this game as others in the comments but I guess I also have ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• taste in games. I personally enjoy the game albeit not nearly as much as I did the first one, but I wouldnt say this game is a waste of time and/or money. Especially if you pick it up on sale. They do cater to people who spend money (I preorderd it and got some OP starting equip) and if you buy the DLC's you will be more overpowered than everyone else.","December 23, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Magicka 2 *is* a very good game, but it requires an update because in current's state, it's very hard to play and enjoy.\n\nFinishing the campaign in solo is awfully difficult and frustrating : The monsters keep blocking you with earth-spells and there is nothing more annoying than to see your movements limited by a badly though gameplay. All the spells have been heavily weakened. Throwing a huge rock to explode frozen monsters is so difficult you won't be able to do it unless really lucky. The shield is worthless, it doesn't block the monsters anymore. And rock barriers won't hold more than one or two seconds, useless.\n\nYour life is much lower than before, and everytime you are hit, your inputs are reset and frozen for two seconds. Winning in solo is basically : Never get hit, never get stuck, or you are dead. The game has been though to be multiplayer, nothing else.\n\nOn the bright side, the fun is still there, voice acting is amazing, graphics are very nice, and animations are close to perfection.","May 27, 2015","true","19.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Your death laser just rebound from frozen enemy!!!! Like WTF!? It should kill it,mechanics are changed.\n\n-You can't cast eletric death laser,frozen eletric death laser,fire death laser...YOU JUST CAN'T!!! IT KILLS FUN!! IN MAGICKA 1 YOU CAN CAST IT!!\n\n-You can't make steam element,which is sad but you can make it by water+fire but there is no steam element same as blizzard element THERE ARE NOT HERE!!!\n\n-You can't heal instantly like in magicka 1,you just wait with healing element on you to heal and you can't cast any other spells.\n\n-You can't load shields!!!!! YOU CAN'T LOAD SHIELDS!!! YOU CAN'T LOAD SHIELDS!!! IN MAGICKA 1 YOU CAN LOAD IT!!! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING RIDICOLOUS SH*T!!!!\n\n-Bar of a spells,for what?I ask for what?If you want make it go ahead and make it in magicka 1,now we play sequel so it's step back for novice players.\n\n-Cooldown for situational spells,for ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing what? TO KILL FUN!?\n\n-Casting spells are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• crap,you can't cast it like in magicka 1.If you want to cast it instantly by pressing sword cast you can't instantly you need to click twice,for no reason.One for cast on sword and second to release from sword,like WTF?\n\n-Loading of a stone spell are much longer+if enemy hit you you are interrupted casting stone,stone is no longer such powerful like in magicka 1.It was funny spell to smash tons of enemies,now it's piece of crap.\n\n-You can't go to arena and smash some enemies just for fun,because enemies are fu*king amazing and can kill you easy.\n\n-Bombers are the biggest bi*ches in this game,they just throw a single bomb and you are fu*ked because you fly around,and throwing back it's really hard,you need to cast spell pushing it back but in magicka 1 you have something like just simple push by pressing right mouse button and you died by bomb in magicka 1 by yours fault not op'enes of bombs.\n\n-Range of explosion from death laser are pretty insane+it's deal tons of damage if you detonate it near you.It's just nearly kills you and you need to heal and healing it's fu*ked from above as you can read.\n\n-You can heal when you have stone armor with is nice,but you can by damaged if you have armor.SRSLY!?

Loved every bit of it, even though none of my friends felt the same or would join me in it. That being said, of course my review is going to have a bias in that direction, after all they tried hard to advertise this game to appeal to the loyal fans.\nAnd they did a pretty good job, minus a few things.\nOne of the things I was very surprised but pleased by was the fact that enemies felt like they finally had more comprehensive weaknesses to certain magicks, such as those crab ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s being weak to steam (which was not an element of its own when I last played the game), and so forth.\nThe gameplay feels alright, but too easy at times and too stressful at others.\nMy main complaint is at the length of the game, though. It seems Paradox is going the popular route following most major devs and focusing more on the MP side of things, which was not the way to go with this game. The campaign was good, I guess, but when I got to the final battle (before I knew it was the final one) I was so excited for the first actual boss fight that would be a challenge, fully expecting the game to pull the kind of 180 on me that the first one did about halfway through by having you  sent to the underworld. Alas, the moment never came, for when I struck down the obvious antagonist of the game, the credits rolled and I was left with a deep unsatisfaction, almost resentment, at the brievity of the experience. Paradox pulled a 180 on me, alright, but then pulled another 180 to form a 360, and I went exactly where I expected but hoped not to be.\nOverall I would rate it about a 6/10, which is around the positive feedback percentage given to the game by reviews anyhow.\n\n\n\nAlso the arena mode felt a little more possible to play and the maps are great, but again, nobody to play with gives a very limited experience with the game.","November 25, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm gonna be honest, the first game's spellcasting was seriously flawed. Go start up your Magicka 1 and use ONLY steam, lightning, and arcane(now called death. Way more fitting to be honest). I bet you can beat the entire game using only that combo. This game is meant for you to try others. With that broken combo out of the way, I feel that I can happily use other spells knowing the game is balanced.\n\nAnother issue I saw was logging in. If you played Magicka: Wizard Wars, then you DO NOT have to create an additional account. This game was MEANT for the people coming from Magicka: Wizard Wars. The controls are the same and the spellcasting is the same with 2 more spell slots.\n\nSomeone also said there is "No free will with magicks" which they are horribly mistaken. There are actually TWO ways to use magicks. One way is the quick bar. The quick bar allows you to quickly use magicks without having to put in the elements. By using the quick bar, however, you are struck with a cooldown for that magick.... ONLY for the quick bar. BUT, if you manually enter in the magick, like the old game, you are NOT struck with a cooldown. I have confirmed this with many magicks.\n\nRebinding keys... I technically don't have a say in this since I adapt to any default keys in any game. To be honest, others should, too. But I hear rebinding keys are in the works. No doubt that they will release a Magick that is related to it. *cough* Crash to Desktop *cough*\n\nThis game is truly a great game. My favorite moment so far was when me and a goblin with a flamethrower were going at it. I was just spraying him with frost and he was spraying fire. At first I was about to win, then the thing freaking smacked me in the face with his flamethrower. 10/10 will spray again.\n\nEDIT:\nI will add one more point. This game has a lot more mobility than in the other game. I can now move around while using spells. Way better.\n\nEDIT 2:\nThere actually is a cooldown by manually entering the magick in. But it is hardly noticeable as it is about 1-2 seconds and it is still significantly faster than using the quick bar.\n\nEDIT 3:\nI hope people know that this game comes after Wizard Wars in the timeline. It's only logical to think that it would be like Wizard Wars. I mean, in the trailer, the Arcane was the same exact thing as the Arcane in wizard wars.","May 26, 2015","true","31.6"," 77 of 155 people (50%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","50","77","155","7","18"

Well to say the least, this game runs really well compared to original magicka even the multiplayer. However there is the lack of steam/ice elements but they can still be used to some degree. The lack of steam/ice causes the game to have less spells than original. The new magick slots are a nice add to the game play and offer you a change to quickly cast same magick twice, since original method of casting them is still viable. Speaking of game play they balanced the spell system by ton which causes the player having to think how to deal with enemies rather than simply mashing buttons and calling it a day. Items and robes add a new layer of strategy to the game and affect how you will want to use your spells and what you will put in your magick slots. Humor is still apparent in game and still gives a good laugh here and there. New controls also enable you moving and casting same time, it takes time to get used to, but it's way more useful than the old system.\n\nGood Stuff\nRuns really well, not bugs\nGame play is challenging and fun\nHumor still gives you laughs\nco-op is easier and not buggy also local co-op\nBalanced spell system makes strategies more important\nInteresting story\nBad Stuff\nLess spells than original\nConnection issues, (caused probably by steam)\nAlways on DRM, Can't play single player if steam is having issues\nBalanced spell system favors simple spells, and not complex ones.\nGame play can be too hard as solo, and system still needs balancing\nOverall i'd rate this game 9/10 despite its flaws, and for 15‚Ç¨ or your regional equivalent, it's a pretty good deal if you ask me.","May 26, 2015","true","14.4"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","0"

The spells that I liked the most were severely nerfed. I can't anymore use the spell combinations that allowed me to quickly freeze large groups of enemies from a distance, because the area of effects of spells was greatly reduced, and the time to charge "stone" projectile spells for long range has become way to long to be useable.\nAnd frozen enemies aren't vulnerable to arcane beams anymore... they reflect it instead.\nSome spells have been added, lots of spells have been removed.

It didn't use a skill slot system or press so and so button to do so and so spell. It was more of learn your spells and do some cool combinations you learn throughout ;))))\nWhich is fun! It's something that let me have fun even if my friends weren't around to play the game. Having friends play with you just significantly made it a much more amazing experience as well as a unique and oddly fun team killing short-venture since for a lot of the time you don't get very far when doing that.\n\nIt's fun to play games that think you're smart enough to know how to combine keys on your keyboard to generate spells and abilities rather than to just press one button and be done with it.\n\nMagicka Wizard Wars I guess gets a pass for making the system a press a button and your good system, but then it's more for the competitive scene... for whoever likes to.... competitive... moba magicka????\nI mean it makes sense to want to only want to focus on what the opponents are doing rather than what keys you have to press for a spell and since these are actual people and not somewhat mindless goblins.\n\nAlthough Magicka 2 is more or less in that center of mindless goblin fighting and teamkilling action. Except it wants to be Wizard Wars... it doesn't have to be, it really doesn't even have to be an expanded Magicka the original it literally can be just Magicka with more stuff and a different adventure, but it's not. It's Wizard Wars Singleplayer. That's not really Magicka in sense, it's just a typical top down game at that point... Where did the Magicka go? Oh we still got spells. It's just... we're using Wizard Wa- It's not good, Magicka was genius. Expanded on something good not moba gameplay for singleplayer.\n\nMagicka is amazing, especially for new people and especially for new people with friends who haven't played before. It's an incredible adventure please try it.\n\nMagicka Wizard Wars is a moba with a boring spell system. If you like mobas then yeah go ahead.\n\nMagicak 2 is Wizard Wars if they tried to make singleplayer. Is not good :((((","October 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

This game continues on with the humor and chaos from the first game and even in single-player I haven't felt a death was unfair or unwarranted, even on the Hard difficulty. That said, I haven't played the hardest difficulty (Bananas) yet. That said, you will probably end up dying a lot if playing by yourself, as the enemies are tougher in this game.\n\nThe only part about this game that I disliked is the fact that Steam and Ice are no longer their own elements, since the game is built on the same engine as Wizard Wars. However in my mind this is a small price to pay for a release that, so far, is no where near as riddled with bugs.\n\nWhile I have only unlocked a small number of them so far, the new artifacts system allows you to customise your gameplay experience. I foresee myself replaying Magicka 2 more than the first game because of this.\n\n\nTL;DR Magicka 2 is a great successor to an already great game. While it lacks a few things from the first game, the new additions more than make up for the losses.","May 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I have almost completed the game though I can tell that the changes made to the combat really ruined what made the original such a unique title. The new casting system is reliant on a gamepad and has cut out a huge amount of spell combinations.\n\nMagicka 2's casting system just seems really plain compared to the original, from what I gather they wanted to balance out the casting system by removing overpowered spells to make it more focused around identifying the weaknesses of particular enemies, though now the combat feels incredibly slow paced and boring.\n\nAs of writing this I'm 2/3 through the game, the story mode is significantly shorter. Thankfully the writing still maintains the quality it had in Magicka and the graphics have been updated, but the pacing of the game is just disappointing overall, the world detail has declined too, there are a lot less hidden areas. I hope that the DLCs improve the game though I seriously doubt they will change its core mechanics which they have really gutted.","May 29, 2015","true","9.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

One of the main points of dislike is that you can't do the same exact spells than in Magicka. They aren't going to release an exact copy of a game, and they needed to balance out the spells because you could use one spell throughout the entire story in Magicka.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpills/recommended/238370/","mrpills","Mr Pills","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpills/","358 products in account","If this is your first entrance into the franchise then I doubt you will be as disapointed as myself and many other fans of the series are of this addition. It is not a bad game by any means, but it is certainly not a sequel which does justice to the original. It has taken everything great about the original and just made it a little bit worse in almost all areas, which as a whole makes the game just seem like a bland cash in.\n\nSo youre probably asking what made the original so special? Magicka was a combination of a very innovative spellcasting system mixed with a very funny referential adventure spanning a mystical world. The combat can be broken into two systems; Spells and Magicks. Spells are what you get by combining up to 5 of 8 different elements; for example Fire and Water makes steam, while Fire Water and Arcane makes a beam imbued with steam. Earth and Fire creates a flaming rock projectile that explodes in a raging inferno. Perhaps you need a patch up? Drop an Earth and Life boulder on your head to heal yourself. Magicks are what we would traditionally think of as spells, they are things you unlock in the game to cast incredibly powerful spells with unique effects. Arcane Lightning and Fire will allow you to run incredibly quickly. Cold and Shield allows you to slow down time to a crawl, giving you the ability to weave around incoming projectiles. The fun comes from how many combinations of Magicks and Spells there are. The original had over 20 unique magicks, ranging from creating a wall of fire to summoning death himself to kill your enemies. Spells could technically hold up to 10 elements when you factored in Fire and Water combining to fill a single slot out of your 5. This allowed for amazing spell combinations such as the fabled Steam-Steam-Arcane-Lightning-Lightning spell. It was incredibly powerful because you could shoot someone with steam thereby wetting them and making them more vulnerable to lightning all in one spell. Normally you would need to cast water, and then cast a lightning spell afterwards. It was overpowered in the base game, but DLC addons created enemies which were literally immune to this spell and created the need for ever adjusting to the resistances of new enemies. Magicka 2 removed all of the fun from both of these systems. There are something like 10 magicks in the entire game, only one of which is very exciting; a spelled called dragons breath which you get in the second level and is so strong you will use it for the entire game. The rest of the spells are bland; a stone that heals in an aoe, a speed spell from original, the ability to summon a few enemies, and a few others which i never used besides the first time i tried them because they were so uninteresting. The original game gave you ability to go invisible and then charm enemies to fight for you. This game also removed the ability for elements to combine, an attempt to remove some of the clunkyness from the original. So yes, you no longer get the overpowered beams of before, but they were only overpowered because of poor balancing in the base game. The DLC's proved that proper balancing made overpower spells impossible.\n\nSomebody else below stated it perfectly, Magicka 1 would have made a fantastic sequel to this game, but instead we are left with something which feels like a large step backwards in the franchise. I could go on for ages about how much worse this game is than the original, but if you haven't played Magicka 1 then none of these points will matter. Just play the first game, it is a cheaper and better experience. Then if you want more Magicka play the DLC as they are all fantastic experiences. Only after that should you play this game, and even then I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless it is on sale for $5-$10.\n\n","May 31, 2015","false","4.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

But i'm here to talk about Magicka 2.\nThe game feels backwards instead of something brand new, almost like the original magicka would be more fitting as the sequel, sure not because of story, but for little experience things and obvious mechanics that were present in the first game, but missing in the second game is why people get frustrated by this game.\n\nFirstly, you cant change controls and are locked to their default, which might not be the best for you, i am left handed so it is quite awkward to use the default control scheme, the problem with this, is that you were able to change controls in the original magicka game no problem, and in wizard wars, so it's a bit strange that they didn't include this for the sequel, in 2015. It is really strange and makes no sense, they then later responded by adding a config, but the config text document, doesnt allow you to use all keyboard controls to change, but only a specific amount.\nA huge turn-off, the magick system is different, and seems to follow some of the rules to wizard wars, but with the same 5 elements, i don't like this, why not build upon the first games system, with the unique spells you could use to keep things just like magicka, and leave the other systems for the different games, it feels like a downgrade, some of elements on screen are placed quite strangely too.\n\nThe actual game though is ok, i'm not going to say its fun, but its not, not enjoyable atleast, and i'm sure with the DLC they can improve and make this game twice as good.\n\nPros\n\nCo-op is good\nChallenges are challenging\nGood art style\n\nCons\n\nNo customising controls\nSpellcasting system is not good\nWards are weak\nFloaty gameplay\nUI elements placing\nStory\n\nThe game is ok, it's not worth the full price though 7.99 like magicka 1 is ok rather than 10.99\nthe developers must have been really lazy, but it can always improve with updates and DLC, thats actually worth it, and not just the same broken game for more cash.\n\nIf i knew the game would be this bad i would have never preordered it, i guess i got put into a trap by how good M1 and MWW are.\n","June 22, 2015","false","7.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rivensong/recommended/238370/","Rivensong","Riven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rivensong/","25 products in account","As someone who's played dozens of hours of the first Magicka game without really delving into Wizard Wars before playing this, I actually recommend Magicka 2 overall.\n\nSpiritually, I find it to be much the same as the original magicka, even if at times the puns and things seemed to be laid a little thick. But then I realize that some players might not be as thorough as I trying to find all the fun stuff that magicka throws in there for us. I LOVED the feeling of going through the world and going "OH! This is where this happened in the first game!" It really made the game world feel like a static, solid thing and not just a backdrop for all the magical foolery this game is known for. Some of the secrets I've found in this game were really clever and some of them, honestly, I never would have found if it weren't for a misfired spell or six. I also loved some of the puzzles, and really hope they make some kinda puzzle map or something later down the road.\n\nBut when it actually comes to the gameplay, as someone who wasn't familiar at all with Wizard Wars there was definitely a learning curve involved trying to "learn to spell again". The changes to steam and ice most notably screwed me up until I found spells and a playstyle that suited me. Pairing steam/ice with lightning is no longer a thing, but I think that in light of the other changes in the game it's actually a good thing to not have "one-hit wonder" type spells that are entirely self-sufficient. It's no longer a case of one-shot or get one-shot type combat, in most circumstances you'll have reaction time to save yourself and adapt to your circumstances. A few of the controls changed, which made it hard for me to rely on my muscle memory from Magicka, but it wasn't anything a bit of practice couldn't fix. Selfies were involved. But I hear they're going to allow remappable keys in the near future which is great, even if it's not a big deal for me personally.\n\nDefensive magic and movement recieved a huge overhaul in Magicka 2 from Magicka and, imo, the sooner you master how to cast while moving the better off you'll be, as spells no longer encumber you NEAR as much as they used to, it's barely noticeable in normal play. But with the changes to solid-based defense spells (ice/stone walls and armors) you'll find that these spells more situational by comparison than in the first Magicka, given that they now have a duration based on magnitude and no longer protect you as completely as they used to. For non-solid based defense spells (fire, lightning, cold, etc.) they made them into scaling resistance based on magnitude that scales from resistance to immunity to full on absorption. These wards, as they're called in game, are an excellent reason why I think the changes to steam/ice are a good thing, because in a co-op setting it makes people choose from fewer elements (less slots, opposites) which makes it easier to defend against or even benefit from friendly fire, arguably one of the most frustrating aspects in the old game because the spells were so powerful you usually got instantly killed from multi-element assault.\n\nFurther, when it comes to personalization and choice within the game, I think the changes to the robe/weapon choices were monumental. When I played co-op I HATED finally finding the tesla staff in the campaign, dying and being almost guaranteed to lose it forever because combat would blow everything everywhere/cliffs involved. But now, you find something in the world and you unlock it permanently to be used whenever you want in something of a loadout system that can be accessed from the main menu of the game, so that if you die you spawn with it in hand, ready to rock. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing awesome. But more over is that these choices of wardrobe actually have a huge impact on your playstyle, much more so than before, imo. They grant great power, but limit your ability to perform with other elements, which I think is a thoughtful twist that I personally like. It makes me problem solve on the fly and see how far I can take one or two main elements.\n\nThe only thing that's gotten me any kind of irritation is the somewhat buggy co-op. It's not often, but there are times when I get randomly dropped from a game with my friend sitting a room over from me while we're in menu setting up a game. I'm not sure what the root cause is, but it's not happened when we're actually in-game, thankfully. I'm not sure what the deal is with unlocks either, as some of them, no matter how many times we brought an item with us to the end of a level, just wouldn't unlock, so I presume they're barred by difficulty? In the event they're not, though, I find it highly irritating.\n\nI also found the story, while interesting, to be somewhat shorter than what I had anticipated. Maybe it just felt shorter because I tore into it like a kid at Christmas, but it felt like...it was missing an element of epicness that the first one had somehow. Most of the time in the story I was just going "WTF vlad", because some of the things he did (no spoilers) simply didn't make sense to me. I hope they'll do another "other side of the coin" type deal to expand on that.\n\nAll in all I know this game will keep me busy for a while and I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.","May 27, 2015","true","45.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I really like the story line and I have to say I like the game in general too. People may hate on it because 'it's not as good as Magicka 1', but this is another game, it isn't supposed to be all the same. I have played Magicka 1 and I loved that game too. Personally I think Paradox did a good job on trying to improve the game, while keeping the same(ish) ambiance as in Magicka 1 (all the references and the silly humor :3 ).\nSome things I didn't like: It seemed like my wizard was outside of my screen sometimes, like the gamescreen was actually larger than my laptop window, which was a little annoying. Futhermore, I couldn't walk back in some areas, while there was no loading screen. This really bothered me, because I was like, well, I check out this area first and then go overthere, and then enemies appeared and after slaying them I could not return to the other part T_T. I Also heard people complaining about the controls, but I haven't played Magicka 1 in a while so this was no issue for me.\nBeside these things, I'd recommend this game to anyone that liked Magicka 1, but don't go in thinking this is Magicka 1 with just some upgraded graphics, because you'll probably be disappointed.\n\nFor alttabbers: alt tab is working fine, no crashes :)\n\nNOTE: I haven't played online yet so I don't know how laggy it will be, but they probably fixed that too. (Magicka 1 was kind of laggy for me sometimes).","May 31, 2015","true","17.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

At least they could allow an option to turn that off.\n\nThis is one of those games that works better with a controller. It sucks they didn't give more love to the KB/M crowd. With a controller, everything clicks. The movement and casting is great. The spells come up quickly. The hot bar is easily accessed. That's how I've been playing and that's how I recommend you play. If that's not an option for you, by preference or not having a controller, I'm not sure what to say. Email Paradox and ask for better mouse support is the best I can do. :/\n\nThey've definitely changed the spell system around, and yes, it does more closely resemble the MOBA version rather than the original, but I've liked the changes. The thing that killed the original for me was that there was one spell (steamx2, lightningx2, arcane) that would pretty much kill anything immediately. As long as you were using the right shield for the situation, you were golden with just that one thing. And that's BORING! In the first couple of chapters, I've been forced to experiment with several kinds of spells with each enemy, searching for their weaknesses. It's far more interesting to be required to know your enemy and react accordingly than to just mindlessly spam a single spell. Several of the negative reviews I read suggested that some enemies are practically invulnerable. And they are...except for their weakness. The same enemy you can blast fire-arcane beams at all day while they laugh and pick their teeth might go down immediately when hit with an AoE water attack. Experiment not only with element combinations, but types of casting. There's something that'll take whatever enemy is giving you trouble down.\n\nThe spell system is not as ridiculously deep as before, since several elements don't combine in the same way, but I don't really miss it. Having a huge array of spells I never use since the steam-lightning-arcane beam will kill everything is inferior to having fewer combinations but the need for all of them. I have fewer spells to use, but I'm actually using more kinds of spells than before. I'm forced to adapt to my enemies, and that's a good change--something I really wanted to see, actually.\n\nSpeaking of spamming, I miss it too. Nothing like a few quick ice-arcane-rock balls to ruin any enemy's day. It's impossible to spam most spells, and that's not great. It's compensated for by allowing movement while casting and spells generally lasting longer than in the original.\n\nYou'll probably have other gripes as you play, and I'm not going to give the asinine "It's only $15! What did you expect?" excuse. I imagine you expected to get a functional game as free of bugs and frustration as possible. And that's...mostly what you'll find here. They will patch out as many of the problems as they can (and agree are actually problems), but even on the first evening of release, it worked near flawlessly for me in single player.\n\nI say "Go for it!". If it's on sale and anything about it sounds appealing, snap it up. For every frustration or bug there will be 20 moments you'll be smiling. :D","May 26, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

A lot about the spell system has changed - which I viewed as a bad thing (since it wasn't the same as Magicka 1). However, if you learn to overlook that it's a different game, it gets quite fun. It's a tonne more challenging than Magicka 1, and this game left me needing breaks from the levels, even when I had 3 other people with me. But, I like the challenge.\n\nIt also encourages you to use more creative spells than Magicka 1, such as more earth spells (which was largely overlooked in the previous game). I found myself using a 4x fire ward (in order to gain health from fire) and then rapidly doing fire+earth and casting it on myself. This way I just made flaming rocks fall near me to kill my enemies.\n\nI very much recommend this game. It is definitely worth 15 dollars. It's also way less buggy than Magicka 1, and feels more refined. Though... I still like Magicka 1 more.\n\nThumbs up from me!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI recommend this a lot more now that a lot of Magicka 1's features were added in. And at $6? This is a steal.

It is still hard because I didn't manage to pass it. For several hours I was trying different tactics to get to final stage 20 through colossal waves of enemies of every type. And I was not prepared to see what I did saw. Karog from Hel. An enormously big devil-like-A-hole with gigantic reaching everywhere hammer which resists fire and death damage and, furthermore,  quickly heals. Three of them, to be exact. And some firethrowing dudes from hell, just to be sure that I leave this ragging comment here. Well, I resisted them with fire shield for quite a time but I made a terrible unforgiving mistake and fire damage shield did not save me from several tons of hammer steel landing right on my head. I hoped that I could still win it by resurrecting myself and getting back into battle. But the game had opposite opinion. 'Let's spawn him right in that fiery crowd with flamethrowers and massive hammers, because losing is FUN¬©' that's what it thought. And me, fully unprepared, got literally burned to a crisp, smashed down and god now what else in a split second with even not a chance of casting resurrection spell. And I sat there. And I gazed at the screen with my empty eyes. And the letters on the screen carved deeply into my heart: "Repeat? Round 1 of 20".\n\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR For those of you, folks, who doesn't like reading: Save your nerves. Go and buy Dark Souls.","May 30, 2015","false","16.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

A lot about the spell system has changed - which I viewed as a bad thing (since it wasn't the same as Magicka 1). However, if you learn to overlook that it's a different game, it gets quite fun. It's a tonne more challenging than Magicka 1, and this game left me needing breaks from the levels, even when I had 3 other people with me. But, I like the challenge.\n\nIt also encourages you to use more creative spells than Magicka 1, such as more earth spells (which was largely overlooked in the previous game). I found myself using a 4x fire ward (in order to gain health from fire) and then rapidly doing fire+earth and casting it on myself. This way I just made flaming rocks fall near me to kill my enemies.\n\nI very much recommend this game. It is definitely worth 15 dollars. It's also way less buggy than Magicka 1, and feels more refined. Though... I still like Magicka 1 more.\n\nThumbs up from me!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI recommend this a lot more now that a lot of Magicka 1's features were added in. And at $6? This is a steal.

You can even start a flame thrower, and then start moving. The part in the beginning of the first Magicka, where you have to stop to cast Freeze, because the first didn't cover? Now you don't have to stop. Much better.

Honestly, I have never been an avid ice user, and steams only purpose for most players was the legendary Lightning Steam Beam, since making people wet was easily done with water itself. Now you can't combine steam with lightning and, really, it didn't really make sense that you COULD. Now people will use more spells!...\n...Or will they? I used one of the staffs, which boosted death(arcane) immensely, but weakened your healing. It was fun watching everyone explode into a red ring of death! But, you will die just as easily, even from the kill AoE. You are more squishy. But you can move while casting, which I absolutely loved. Backing away while firing death beams and fire beams at trolls and everything else, incredibly satisfying.\nAnd the items. Gods, the items. For most of the game, I used a sword that dealt cold damage. This literally meant that enchanting it with water, it froze enemies in two hits! If you lose a level, you can go look at the robes you have and think: what could help me out here? Honestly, up until the final boss, I was fine, playing vanilla robe, but it got difficult at times, mostly with crabs. The staff choices are not bad: do you want life or death? Fire or ice? Utility elements or offensive elements? There was even one that boosted healing at the cost of making everything else weaker. Talk about dedicated support.\n\nPros:\n-Nice selection of robes and staves, though the melee weapons could have something extra.\n-You can actually mix and match said robes, staves and melee weapons. One wardrobe for every level!\n-You will use more combos here, though SSSSS is rather effective with death boosting staffs.\n-Persistent sword enchantments when you aren't using rock, shield, life, ice or death. You can swing your flaming sword more than once before it extinguishes.\n-The demon companion? Adds a fun little challenge: Use this element for extra damage!\n-Move while casting! Backpedal beam!\n-You can cook crabs.\n-I always wanted to do a melee only run, and with ARTIFACTS, it might be possible with minimal ranged spells!\nCons:\n-You are even more of a squishy wizard than originally, and absorption shields can only help you against one element.\n-New controls, new Magicks. "Learn to spell again."\n-No more staff abilities. There were lots and lots of "panic button" abilities, like the smoke bomb or the deflection shield.\n-Rock armor seems really weak now...\n-There ARE crabs.\n\nI hope my ranting has either scared you away from all Magicka players ever, or made you think "Oh dang, I should buy this game!".\nAll in all, I enjoyed the game!","May 27, 2015","true","22.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So much better.\n\nBut no rebinding options, it seems, makes me a sad panda.\n\n\nOverall, I think they did a lot of good things. The bad stuff, is the story, so far, which seems like it won't be anything new, but I could be wrong. But if you want to play this with friends, in coop or pvp, it doesn't matter about the story. (To clarify, the story is new, it's not a remake, but it seems to be simply another dig at various existing tropes, which can get a little bit tiresome)","May 27, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Ice and Steam are no longer their own element. Quick bind keys for Magicks, making memorization pointless. Lightning has precedence over arcane (which is now death) meaning no lightning lasers or ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• mines. Also, no giga ice swords. But, all of these actually made the game insanely easy. Spamming mines in a corner and teleporting with a premade sword made it quite easy. With cooldowns and comboing and proper elemental usage taking importance over strong spells, I feel like its improved a bit.","May 27, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Honestly, I have never been an avid ice user, and steams only purpose for most players was the legendary Lightning Steam Beam, since making people wet was easily done with water itself. Now you can't combine steam with lightning and, really, it didn't really make sense that you COULD. Now people will use more spells!...\n...Or will they? I used one of the staffs, which boosted death(arcane) immensely, but weakened your healing. It was fun watching everyone explode into a red ring of death! But, you will die just as easily, even from the kill AoE. You are more squishy. But you can move while casting, which I absolutely loved. Backing away while firing death beams and fire beams at trolls and everything else, incredibly satisfying.\nAnd the items. Gods, the items. For most of the game, I used a sword that dealt cold damage. This literally meant that enchanting it with water, it froze enemies in two hits! If you lose a level, you can go look at the robes you have and think: what could help me out here? Honestly, up until the final boss, I was fine, playing vanilla robe, but it got difficult at times, mostly with crabs. The staff choices are not bad: do you want life or death? Fire or ice? Utility elements or offensive elements? There was even one that boosted healing at the cost of making everything else weaker. Talk about dedicated support.\n\nPros:\n-Nice selection of robes and staves, though the melee weapons could have something extra.\n-You can actually mix and match said robes, staves and melee weapons. One wardrobe for every level!\n-You will use more combos here, though SSSSS is rather effective with death boosting staffs.\n-Persistent sword enchantments when you aren't using rock, shield, life, ice or death. You can swing your flaming sword more than once before it extinguishes.\n-The demon companion? Adds a fun little challenge: Use this element for extra damage!\n-Move while casting! Backpedal beam!\n-You can cook crabs.\n-I always wanted to do a melee only run, and with ARTIFACTS, it might be possible with minimal ranged spells!\nCons:\n-You are even more of a squishy wizard than originally, and absorption shields can only help you against one element.\n-New controls, new Magicks. "Learn to spell again."\n-No more staff abilities. There were lots and lots of "panic button" abilities, like the smoke bomb or the deflection shield.\n-Rock armor seems really weak now...\n-There ARE crabs.\n\nI hope my ranting has either scared you away from all Magicka players ever, or made you think "Oh dang, I should buy this game!".\nAll in all, I enjoyed the game!","May 27, 2015","true","22.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I played the first Magicka a short while ago with a friend, and couldn't get away from it!  I loved the humor that they have and just the silly mechanics!  I have been waiting a long while for this game to come out.  I can easily say, that this second game is just as good, even better.  The multiplayer system is incredible (Dropping in and out) and the artifacts are pretty funny to use.  Of course, there are going to be a ton of bugs, but they can't find them if people can't report them.  The bugs that are still there are small, like the mouse moving to the middle of the screen.  Even if the game wasn't completely ready to be released, I think it was good that it was (For all of the "to heart Magicka fans" like me and for bugs).  Paradox will, for sure, fix all of these in a matter of time.  I definitely recommend this game, mainly to people who have friends to play with (and argue with :P).

This computer can run three copies of Crysis on maximum settings with enough left over to compute the next greatest prime number, and yet Magicka 2's battles occasionally drop it below 20 FPS. It is poorly optimized and in intense fights this is fatal.\n\nSecond, poorly programmed Revivals. I've been game over'd five times now by the 'helpful' AI familiar deciding to respawn me over a cliff or a bottomless lake, or in the center of an angry mob of pitchfork wielding townsfolk. It renders the game absurdly difficult at best in singleplayer, and at worst impossible to beat.\n\nThird, the loss of combined elements and the reduction in spells. Magicka 1 had dozens of Spells and combinations of elemental attacks. Magicka 2 does away with all that pointless frippery and instead hamstrings the formerly enjoyable and intuitive system. No more Ice or Steam elements, just Fire+Water and Cold+Water. The Shield element is also now effectively useless, as its barriers last five seconds at best and do nothing to block physical damage.\n\nFourth, the keys. This game requires a middle mouse button. Would you like to reassign your keys? Too bad. There is NO keybindings menu. Period.\n\nI could go on, but the gist of it is, Magicka 2 does not feel like a PC game, or even a Magicka game. Magicka 2 feels like a Tablet port. A BAD Tablet port. It has fewer features and far less content than Magicka 1, a worse interface, fewer options and all around is plain inferior. Just go buy Magicka 1 and have fun gibbing your friends, avoid paying $15 for a poorly-made cash in.","June 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's shorter, has less magicks, less weapons, less elements and less combinations of those elements. They've also made the game much harder - which isn't necesarily a bad thing, but the way they've done it just encourages ragequiting. Sheild spells and elemnet immunities are almost entierly removed from the game, and most enemies now 1-shot a player. This makes single player very difficult, and makes multiplayer far less strategic. There used to be multiple team members casting diffiernt buffs and healing. Now you just choose who's the distraction to run at the enemy, die, and get revived while a few friends hang back and shoot things.\n\nPros: Music is great, as it was in the first game. Writting is on point too. Classic magicka humor will have you cracking up.\n\nOverall, it feels like a beta test of the first Magicka before they realized what good gameplay was and how awesome a truly dynamic spell system is and decided to add those. Except it's 4 years after the original... Is this what passes for a sequel these days?\n\n3/10 Might be worth 1-2 dollars on a steam sale some day.\n\nI think for the current price you could get the original + all DLC (which are very good) and have about 5x more gamplay, 3x the replayablity, and 2x more fun.","June 16, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Disappointingly, the game's many enemy encounters do not feel as memorable as the first. Which leads to my biggest gripe with this sequel.\n\nWhere this game truly pales in comparison to its predecessor is its Soundtrack.\n\nAlmost every level in Magicka 1 was accompanied by an Orchestral Masterpiece that helped make every enemy encounter FEEL like an epic Tolkien fantasy battle interspersed with images of your friends fending off hordes with a weenie on a stick and/or dying horribly.\n\nThe Background Music in this game is instantly forgettable save for the few encounters where a remixed "Dunka Dunka" is playing from a radio ingame.\n\nThe new artifact gameplay changes have definite potential, though I have not yet tried all of them, I hope the strictly cosmetic artifacts (Sitcom Audience being my favorite, where an unseen audience laughs at you when you die) wont prevent you from unlocking things.\n\nIn regards to humor, this game lacks the comedic stings of the original by resorting to in large part awful old memes and Game of Thrones references. But these are easily missed and ignored.\n\nAll in all Magicka 2 is an OK sequel, it isnt completely disappointing like sequels are in general, and unfortunately, the spellcasting system is not as complex as in the first, the OP spells of old are replaced by the Shield tactic of spamming rock+ice/fire/arcane while equipping a shield of the same element. There is definite room for improvement, which we may see down the line in ...*groan* DLC. Then again i had a lot of fun with Dungeons and Daemons from magicka 1 so we'll see.","May 29, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But Paradox forgot something immensly important when making this game, the magic..... Not the litteral kind, I mean the Disney magix and whinsey that the first game gave off... And before you say anything, NO I don't mean clone the first game, I mean take what it gave and improve, not forget HALF of what made is special.\n\nAlso, fair warning, this is long. But if you are considering buying this game, I at least recommend you skim this. You have been warned.\n\nI'm not going to go into the controls, art, and basic spells, those are fine. Alot of people are iffy on them, but I have no gripes with them. Also, A+ on the added Poison element.\n\nWhat I do hate is the basic items you get. The abilety to make your own loadout with your own robes is cool, I like it. But the proble is they are not special anymore. What most of them do is buff/weaken certain spells, or change movement speed. Most of the robes did that in 1, true, but what I'm really talking about here are the staves. There are NO stave secondarys here, they all just buff/weaken. What about the rogue staff that allowed you to use smokebombs? The Scythe that spead poison? The Freedom Staff with grenades? GANDOLF'S STAFF OF LIGHT!!! They COMPLETELY changed how you played with new abiletys, but ushually at some price. If we had THOSE staves on the loadout screen, that would be AMAZING!!! But we have instead is the Skull stave.... It makes life spells suck, but you death better... Yay?\n\nBut hey! We have GAME CHANGING ARTIFA- what is this? An item that makes the game black and white? Giving enemys more HP? Why? I got more game changes from starting the game as Dr. Doom than this. How about something WORTH getting? Like a goblet that turns you undead ghost that heals from death, but is hurt by life. That would be a load of fun when playing with freinds, trying to heal you but accidentally killing you instead. Or maybe a bomb bag that makes you Kamakazi the SECOND fire touches you? Some fun stuff like that! And each player could have their own artifact, making the battlefeild MAYHEM!!!\n\nAlso, Magicks suck now. All those weird spells you could cast after entering a spell code with good and bad effects? Most of them are gone. Black Hole, the most deadly one, is created by crossing life and death. Most conflicts can now be ended by just doing that over, and over again. It made SENSE it was the last Magick! Now it's a joke! And you get Magicks NOT from well hidden tomes, but from playing the story mode. Instead of a code, you just click a button. You CAN enter the code... But why? Spells like Conflagerate were super fun to use because it was a bit tricky to use, but when you got it working, you felt satified! You murdered ALL those imps by imputing the spell correctly! Now you just hit a button... Is conflag even in this game?.... NO! Cause that was fun! We now have a dragon strike, while better, is alot less fun. You hit a button, and there's fire. Good job, now get back to work. Raisde dead was tricky, and you only got a few zombies, but if you could keep your steak up, you felt like a real necromancer! Summoning armys of zombies to fight!... Now you got a bunch of skeletons you can't spam... Cute.\n\nBut the biggest tragety of all is the lack of secrets. In Magicka 1, secret stuff was EVERYWHERE! Like the sword that 1 hit K.O'd one of the final bosses! Or the Sword of Masters hidden beside a creek you would not think to check! I wasted SO much time in Magicka 2 trying to find secrets that did not exsist! Does this lake go anywhere? No. This one? no. This cave? No, this one- Oh hey..... A camo skin....... Neat. And where this is a secret, it's SO OBVIOUS, and the pay out is another staff that does ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all. Gimmie a reward! Like a staff of Invisabilety! Or something that spits poison! Or the abilety to Charm! ANYTHING WORTH GETTING!!!!!\n\nAlso, the Melee is broken, yeah. I keep swinging at an imp, and my blade constantly goes through him like Elsa's hair. Not that Melee is even worth doing. No weapon is THAT neat. It either does more damage, or a little bit of death, or a little bit of.... Life WHAT..... WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY LIFE MELEES!?!? ARE YOU JOKING!?!? I'm nitpicking, onward. There isn't even any sidearms, like the pistol that one of the original wizards had, or the M18, the Throwing records, the insta-freeze swords! Magicka is about being broken! Cause even if you are god, YOU WILL STILL DIE!!! So much stuff is thrown at you in these games you NEED those powerful weapons to kill the enemy. Magic is not your ONLY tool!\n\nI haven't even gotten to how much less exciting this game's story is, or some of the other flaws. But I hope you see where the problem is. It's just shallow. It's the diffenece between Mario Party 5 and Mario Party 10. They got rid the biggest fun factor for something easier. And no fake difficuly can hide that. Alone, this game is fine, but when your a sequel, you HAVE something to compaire to! And by god, this is not cutting it for Magicka, one of the best bloody games I've played\n\nParadox, I'm dissapointed, but I'm not giving up on you. Magicka 1 and it's expanchions was incredable, even if the netcode sucked for a while. Take what made Magicka 1 great, and build up. And take some of the things that worked in Magicka 2, and again, build up. This was a flop, but I'm certain you can move on, and make something even better with what you learned from this. God's speed.","October 7, 2015","false","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After all the hype building with the comical trailers and pre-order rewards, I was expecting the next big adventure for the Magicka series. Instead, what I got was a short, shallow and frustrating Magicka game that fails to understand what made the first game such a blast to play. Magicka 2 lacks content, magicks and even spell combinations from the 1st game and it doesn't replace it with much else. There is less of everything in Magicka 2 which wouldn't be a big deal if what was there was any good.\n\nHowever, it's biggest flaw is just how unfun this game is. Some of your basic defenses have been dramatically weakened and your health decreased causing you to die within 1-3 seconds of being spawned in the more difficult areas if you are not lightning fast with your wards. You will die over and over again and barely achieve much during your short lives. To make matters worse, arcane (death) deals the best damage now but is crippled by causing huge explosions when an enemy is killed with it and that explosion can deal great damage to you and your allies. Often killing them which gets really annoying. They ramped up friendly fire to the extreme here.\n\nNow the game being harder isn't necessarily a bad thing conceptually, it's more of a problem due to how they increased the difficulty. The new difficulty modes aren't any fun to play at all. All they do is give enemies more health, the players less, and allow enemies to regenerate health, as well as other adjustments. Anyway there are plenty of other reviews that go into more depth within the game's mechanics but I think you get the jist of it here.\n\nUltimatelly I cannot recommend this game. It is much less fun than Magicka 1 and if you are a new comer to the series, just go play Magicka 1. If you are returning from Magicka 1, this game is most likely going to disapoint you more than anything else. If that's the case, lower your expectations and perhaps buy the game on sale and approach it as DLC to the first game and then maybe you'll find a tiny amount of entertainment here.","July 2, 2015","false","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This has occured even while using the binded "stop" key.\n\nHowever, to be fair, I did go into the settings and change around a few keybindings to attempt to replicate the feeling I had while playing the original Magicka. The game feels great for that part, but the movement while casting has ruined it for me personally.\n\nOh, as I also found out the hard way, wards don't exactly work anymore. For example, casting shield and water doesn't prevent you from getting wet like it does in the original Magicka.\n\nI suppose, in the end, I was really hoping for a continuation of the style in the original Magicka.\nApparently a lot of things changed behind the scenes between the games, and this game is not what I hoped it was going to be.","January 3","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was not very amusing, every enjoyful moment me and my friends had in the first magicka was vanished in this title. The only good part is the excellent soundtrack of this game. We still wanted to finish the campaign, even we had much struggle keeping all players online, because the game intends to kick one player everytime something happens. So abaout every 2 mins we had to wait until 1 Player reconnects to the game. Nobody of us had an idea what could cause such problems in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Cesium/recommended/238370/","Mr_Cesium","A Filthy Casual","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Cesium/","149 products in account","POST UPDATES REVIEW:\n\nI'm........shocked at how Paradox North managed to pull this together.\nEvery single problem encountered at launch has been fixed.\nThe inclusion of the new poison element is awesome, to boot.\n\nTL;DR: Don't read the original review. Buy Magicka 2. Enjoy it.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nMagicka (The Original) is a GREAT, AMAZING GAME. BUY IT. Magicka 2 is a *good* game. As in, not AS good as the original, but still good, kind of? Think Diablo II and Diablo 3.\n\nI never thought I'd give a Magicka game a bad recommendation, but.......*sigh*\n\nTL;DR: Buy Magicka (the original). If you have it, buy Magicka 2 when it's on sale and you have nothing else to do.\n\nMagicka 2 feels like 50 steps forward, and 55 steps back.\n\nMagicka (the original) is one of my favorite games of all time.\nNothing comes close to it.\n\nMagicka: Wizard Wars got me incredibly excited......until I realized that they dumbed it down to bare-bones as far as the magic system is concerned.\n\nMagicka 2 was like a dream come true. A sequel to one of my favorite games? Of course I'm happy!\n\nUnnnntiiillll...... I realized they made it more similar to Wizard Wars than the original....\n\nThe controls feel floaty and slippery like in Wizard Wars, and the controls have completely changed since the original, and the lack of rebindable keys makes this worse.\n\nAdditonal Info/Edit:\nI feel like more detail is required here, I'll admit I kind of jumped the gun when I fired off this review, but I meant what I said.\n\nThe spell system has changed drastically since the original. Which is not inherently bad. However, things changing caused them to lose value. The earth element is basically useless now, seeing as charging a huge boulder takes WAY too long. This causes interesting combinations like the "Ice Ball of Death" from Magicka 1 almost impossible to pull off. I however, really LIKE that lightning doesn't become a beam when mixed with arcane/death. THAT opens up possiblities that I may not have even discovered yet. Also, the Shield element: There is basically no reason to use it on its own. Shield doesn't block ANYTHING other than elemental attacks? That's a HUGE change from the original that takes away from the chaos that made the original good.\n\nThe fact that steam and ice elements do not combine IN the spell queue is a significant change. One that can be adapted to, if it weren't for the fact that those types of damage are impossible to stack against creatures that are weak to it. For example, Steam damage is very effective against the lobster/crab things. However, in any given spell, you can only have a MAXIMUM of 2 Steam elements in queue, leaving very little room for customization.\n\nIn addition, the change that makes frozen entities NOT weak to physical damage is honestly pretty lame. I really miss that from the first game. My friends and I loved to tag-team bosses with one of us freezing him, and the rest unleashing huge boulders to shatter them into pieces. A strategy that is now impossible due to the change listed as well as earth element spells being incredibly slow and lackluster.\n\nThe quickbar concept SOUNDS like a really good idea, and I'll admit I thought it was a great idea, however I quickly realized that being able to spam magicks with a single button click on a cooldown system really took the fun out of the Magicks themselves. I quickly become aware that I was able to spam-cast dragon strike and haste using a staff that regenerated focus very quickly. I knew how to cast Summon Elemental and Summon Death by memory in the original, and that allowed me to do some crazy things that made me FEEL like a wizard. You actually had to try to do stuff like that quickly.\n\nThe controls being similar to Wizard Wars is a VERY minor flaw, all things considered, I would happily adapt and shut up about it if the original gameplay of Magicka was kept intact. It, however, was NOT kept intact in Magicka 2.\n\nALSO: Including a MULTIPLAYER-ONLY PUZZLE?! Really? I mean, I know its a "co-op" game, but FORCING it is just a bad decision. I don't have "friends".","May 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","21"

But sadly, here it goes:\n\nThe good\nIt's the new Magicka! Having Magicka 1 behind it, Magicka 2 couldn't fail(at least, that is what I thought before).\n\nGraphics Graphics are vastly improved, everything is smoother.\n\nHumor and references Humor is good. It makes you laugh.\n\nFriendly fire Friendly fire is always activated and you can not disable it. Fantastic for losing friends(if you have friends that bought Magicka 2 and want to play it)\n\nThe bad\nSpell casting system is limited Here is why:\n\n* Lightning does not form a beam when combined with arcane => Ruins wet-run away-fire lightning + arcane from distance tactic\n\n* Shields only block elementary damage => No chaos on the screen\n\nMagick system is copied from Magicka: Wizard Wars You have 4 magicks available at the moment and the game encourages you to click their buttons in the quick bar to activate them. They also have a temporary cooldown. This is bypassed by equipping a staff that regenerates your mana quickly. You can manually enter element combination and activate magicks that way, but the whole magick system feels nerfed.\n\nThe game forces you to play with friends Enemies are too hard to beat if you are playing solo, a single goblin hits you three times and you are dead. In some cases, you need to interact with some parts of the level and fight enemies at the same time. It's simply too hard to play alone. What if I don't have friends that want to play Magicka 2?\n\nFinal words\nMagicka 2 is inferior to Magicka 1 in every way except graphics and stability.\n\nIf you have not bought Magicka 2 yet, buy Magicka 1, beat it, than play Magicka: Wizard Wars. If you like it, buy Magicka 2. Otherwise, stay away from Magicka 2.","May 26, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game has lost all it's tactical play, spells have boiled down to using one tactic on each kind of enemy. The control scheme for gamepads is much easier to use, I find myself being able to cast almost as quickly as with a keyboard, but the implementation of auto-casting spells like haste just seems pointless; the only purpose I can think of for it would be to allow newer players to cast bigger spells more easily, but that should come about organically throught the campaigns difficulty curve (which was woefully up and down in Magicka 2). In the original Magicka, you played a powerful wizard with a myriad of options for each encounter, whereas in Magicka 2 you feel like a glass cannon, and an incredibly pathetic one at that. In an effort to make the gameplay faster and more compelling, the new developer has destroyed what made the original such a success.\n\nAlthough it is true that the updated graphics have much more fidelity, the enemies have lost their personality, and the spells look more generic compared to the previous game, so aesthetically the game is much worse off, so I can't even recommend this game from a visual perspective.\n\n\ntl,dr:\nNew developer took everything that made the first game great and flushed it down the toilet.\nIf you liked Magicka in any way then do not buy this game.","March 26","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While the first game was good, this game is almost completely identical! I wouldn't pay anything for this, because the changes to the game are so minor, it ammounts to little more than a small handful of gameplay tweaks, and a new campaign. I would expect this much content to be a completely free update, and this honestly feels like I've just been swindled. In addition, the gameplay get MUCH more difficult very early into the game, likely because of the addition of spellcasting while moving. The developers seem to have overestimated how much of a difference this change makes to the gameplay, and coping with the increased diffifulty is very frustrating. The only thing I can consider an upside of this game is that it looks slightly more modern (still not comparable to almost any titles from 2015), and the multiplayer system is ever so slightly convoluted, although it does occasionally place you into mulitplayer without warning. In addition, I would steer clear of buying this if you have a mac, because several versions of OSX have a game breaking bug in which all key presses are recieved twice by the game, making it completely impossible to log into the game (a required step). Overall, the game feels extremely limited in terms of the value of the changes, to the point that playing this game feels similar to replaying the original. I would NOT recommend buying this game, unless you spent hundreds of hours on the original, and a new campaigne is worth this much money to you.","December 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Arcane is strong against any living creature, so far, there is no real use of undead creatures, so arcane is strong against anyone except for fire mobs (somehow resists arcane ?). Since fire mobs are weak to ice, then just have a strong ice user. A healer might be a good idea, since many staves reduce life magic. Life + Arcane cross beam is useful too.\n\nAll in all, the game is not difficult if you know how it works, you MUST move while casting. The keybinding just came up, a bit rudimentary, but I can live with it for now.\n\nLastly, I found a single irritating bug, which is a problem with the Y axis (a beam going through an enemy because some derping on the Y axis), but if you using an AoE instead of a beam or a projectile, you'll be fine.","May 29, 2015","true","16.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Honestly not getting the criticism for this game - the new controls allow for moving while casting, and makes it so that you don't have to focus on moving too much. The new spell balance feels a LOT nicer, and it's not just "spam one combo to win" like Magicka 1. And the fact that spells don't combine into single-slot new elements now seems mostly for balance than anything - which is nice.\n\nPlus, the new features just add to the experience. 1-2-3-4 Magick casting is great for having newer players get used to the game, while they never removed regular Magick casting (and casting them regularly has less cooldown, anyway!) -- so you can still reactively press W-A-SPACE and A-S-F-SPACE for your revive and haste spells, respectively - while assigning your 1-2-3-4 keys to Magicks you don't quite remember the combo for yet. (I never could remember the combo for Conflagration / Dragon Strike, for instance!)\n\nAnd likewise, the game is a lot more balanced now. The spellcasting is more focused on casting against the weakness of your enemy now instead of just overpowering them with a single spell combo. The difficulty also seems to be ramped up a bit now - enemies tend to swarm a LOT more. You'll want a friend to play with - although playing alone isn't impossible anymore, thanks to the new Familiar companions. Once you get revived (at the cost of your familiar), you can easily just revive your Familiar back again with a quick W-A-SPACE. Just make sure you're not in enemy fire first. ;D","May 29, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

First of all, the movement and attack system are confusing and badly-designed, and with four different button combinations for different attack types I commonly find myself attempting to use a mass attack and ending up swinging my sword. Secondly, the missions are overly complicated and difficult. It took me three tries just to get past the tutorial, as the laggy movement system kept sending me right into the fire. On the Goblin Raid mission, it is nearly impossible to get past the bridge fight because after you die, since you are constantly being attacked by five goblins, by the time you respawn the goblins are already back to attacking you, and when you try to back up you are blocked by the area barrier, so you die again and fail the mission.

Too bad im not allowed to refund the game cause i would in a heartbeat. The game feels like an Iphone app now. It feels like an arcade game. Its not immersive at all compared to Magicka 1, which actually made you feel like your in this wizard world and you where conjuring elements to create your own badass spells. There are LESS functions compared to Magicka 1, Less spell combinations, less spell effects for yours Sword, AOE, etc. Less animations for spells. For example, when you place a shield in Magicka 1 it was a glorious Curved dome shield that felt powerful and reflected beams and absorbed damage well. In Magicka 2 however, the shield you place is a completely flat rectangular yellow wall that pops into existence and feels like youre using a pizza box to protect yourself. Theres absolutely no immersion. The only pro this game has is the graphics are nice. But thats it. The gameplay is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

While understandable from MOBA point of view to reduce the damage you do , i doesnt make sense in here\n\nIn Magicka you could through understanding of Elements rules Create really Powerfull spells Like Arcane electric Pillars of Ice or very Powerfull steam lasers and because battles were quite chaotic Powerfull shields to protect you (mostly from yourself and your Friends)\n\nHere you will find none of that , elements are the nerfed versions of themselfs from Wizard Wars while enemies still swarm you like they did in Magicka (but now you have no real way of quickly dispaching them)\nWeapons and Staffs feels the same and are just bonuses to your elements like they were in Wizard Wars\n\nThe worst offender are probably the "Game changing Artefacts" while most are just some game rebalances that i couldnt care less for.

But the changes in magicka 2 are not for me.\n\nI find the new movement system interesting. Being able to cast spells on the move makes you more mobile as a wizard. The problem is that the ranges of cone and AOE spells are decreased. Also the damage of al spells is decreased. As a result you feel weak in comparison to the first Magicka.\n\nI also do not like the new spell formula. I can understand why some people would like to cast spells with fewer amount of button clicks. I rely liked the old way. The most powerful spells demanded up to 10 clicks. With the new system you can‚Äôt cast spell with more than 5 basic elements. Fire and water do not become steam in one slot. It is the same with water and ice.\n\nA minor problem for me is that the game seems to have been made with consoles in mind.

I feel sorry that I have convinced my friends to buy this game, hoping we'll have as good time as we had in Magicka 1.\n\nI was in love with Magicka 1, I've played it over 10 times. I also played Wizard Wars since alpha, for quite long time. Magicka 2 is like an inbred baby of these two, dropped to it's head in infancy and raised by alcoholics. It took cons from both these games, added a handful of bad solutions of it's own, and almost completely ignored everything good these games had.\n\nLet's count the great things that already were in Magicka 1 that didn't made it into the sequel:\n\nSteam and Ice are no longer individual elements, meaning you can't combine them with lighting element. This reduces amount of possible combos, and there is nothing to fill the void - developers has removed a feature and haven't added anything here.\n\nCool weapons - I admit I haven't played the game till it's end (and I'm not sure I will), but almost everything that was found in Magicka 1 felt awesome and gameplay changing. Thor's hammer, staff that regenerates health, staves with spells, machine gun, masters' sword, knife of counter-striking - everything was awesome. Here? After playing for 3 hours everything I found was boring stats weapons and staves. Weapon that adds little element dmg, stave that increases certain element dmg... Yawn.\nI understand why these weapons would be in WW, since it's a PvP, but why ruin creative freedom of coop game?\n\nBalance - granted, Magicka 1 was a bit easy at times, but it was completely possible for solo players. More than that, I've finished it multiple times even before the resurecting fairy update, it was challenging, but fun as hell. Here playing solo is difficult, repetitive and boring. Foes are numerous, fast, and often have one-shot-kill attacks. Great, huh?\n\nEnchanted melee - I was disappointed when I learned that you can enchant melee weapons in WW, and was looking forward to it in Magicka 2. And it is here.. but it doesn't feels like it. It's week, range is laughable, and there is absolutely no reason to do it for offence.\n\nPush - Magicka 1 featured a push spell. Simple, niche, but cool looking and effective where it was needed. Here? It's tier 1 magick with cooldown and long animation. It's a downgrade.\n\nAwesomeness of magicks - Once again, I haven't seems them all, but what I've seen saddens me. Haste lasts for couple of seconds, napalm kills only weakest of foes, and there is COOLDOWN. A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING COOLDOWN. In Magicka 1 you could spam spells. It was not always profitable and challenging, which is why it felt rewarding when you did that to a great effect. Here? Magicks looks like party tricks, not as powerful spells.\n\nStory mode - it was silly in Magicka, but there was a story it was interesting to look at. In Magicka 2 story is much more nonsensical in a bad way, just being a sad excuse to throw some enemies at you, I've stoped paying attention to what's going on at chapter 3.\n\nSeems plenty to me. Plenty of reasons not to buy this game.\n","June 4, 2015","false","3.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

In Magicka 2, you can't. You must learn to use different spells to encounter different enemies.\n2) Improved Mobility - You can cast spells while moving\n3) Customizable loadout - After you've discovered a new Weapon/Staff, you can bring it to your next game/life.\n4) Quick cast magick - Absolutely Great!! Manual cast is still there, with less cooldown than quick cast\n5) Easier to get heal - You can get heal even you are with stone/ice armor\n6) Improved gamepad control - Keybaord is still the best option for playing Magicka 2, but gamepad is also a good option for playing local co-op.\n\nCons:\n1) Can't remap keybind (Dev is working on this)\n2) Staff active ability is removed\n3) Wards resistance effect is a bit too weak\n4) Rock projectiles take too long to charge its power and travel distance\n\nOpinions/Questions:\n1) I don't think the removal of ice&steam elements is a huge drawback, you can still cast ice&steam with less input effort. However, It would be great if ice&steam spells can have more damage bonus.\n2) What is the use of life wards?

If it wasnt different you couldnt justify spending another $16 to get a game thats the same as one you already have. Its different and thats OK. It will take getting used to.\n\nMagicka 2 is still has a very versatile spell casting system, its still hilarious, and it has better online support.\n\nI look forward to playing more of this game.\n\n","May 26, 2015","true","26.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonj82/recommended/238370/","neonj82","Cirom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonj82/","222 products in account","A more balanced Magicka. Honestly not getting the criticism for this game - the new controls allow for moving while casting, and makes it so that you don't have to focus on moving too much. The new spell balance feels a LOT nicer, and it's not just "spam one combo to win" like Magicka 1. And the fact that spells don't combine into single-slot new elements now seems mostly for balance than anything - which is nice.\n\nPlus, the new features just add to the experience. 1-2-3-4 Magick casting is great for having newer players get used to the game, while they never removed regular Magick casting (and casting them regularly has less cooldown, anyway!) -- so you can still reactively press W-A-SPACE and A-S-F-SPACE for your revive and haste spells, respectively - while assigning your 1-2-3-4 keys to Magicks you don't quite remember the combo for yet. (I never could remember the combo for Conflagration / Dragon Strike, for instance!)\n\nAnd likewise, the game is a lot more balanced now. The spellcasting is more focused on casting against the weakness of your enemy now instead of just overpowering them with a single spell combo. The difficulty also seems to be ramped up a bit now - enemies tend to swarm a LOT more. You'll want a friend to play with - although playing alone isn't impossible anymore, thanks to the new Familiar companions. Once you get revived (at the cost of your familiar), you can easily just revive your Familiar back again with a quick W-A-SPACE. Just make sure you're not in enemy fire first. ;D","May 29, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

For instance, you can no longer mix certain elements like steam and lightning. Physics on rocks are weird. Spells in general lack the punch they once had. The shield element is pretty useless, at least by itself (enemies can pass through them now and it doesn't last nearly long enough.) Melee attacks are super clumsy and sometimes don't even connect when they should. Even the act of just moving your wizard feels strange and clumsy.\n\nAnd to top things off, they didn't add anything new, aside from artifacts and spell hotkeys (both admittedly good things). Magicka actually has more to it than Magicka 2. It's my feeling that cutting content without adding anything should preclude the right to put a "2" on a game. It feels like they tried to fix what wasn't broken,.. and broke it.\n\nSo I'm not being entirely negative, it would still be an ok game if the original hadn't existed. And there's still the same charming wackiness. The problem rests entirely in the actual mechanics.","June 1, 2015","false","9.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I also love playing Magicka: Wizard Wars from time to time.\n\nMagicka 2 has the advantage of not crashing like Magicka 1 used to on release. Also, it takes the movement from M:WW which makes Magicka 1's movement feel a bit like a constant drag. And that's it.\n\nThe game feels clunky, slowed down, limited. It's like they took as only feedback from Magicka 1 "Yeah but some people do always the same overpowered spell, it's not fun", and built to counter that. No more overpowered spells, they are all underwhelming. No more maniacal laugh while making your enemies go "SPLAT!", now even the basic critter has a large chunk of health and heavy damage, which requires you to run around to not die, and hope you can kill enough to hold on, on the way.\n\nSpell animation is slower, you don't feel like you can easily fire everything at anything. Even magickas are on a cooldown (no more chain reviving for you, no, it was "too easy", probably).\n\nAnd the crown of diappointment goes to the earth-only spells. Sure, you can shoot at a rather high speed a pebble, a little rock (one or two elements of earth). But try to make a giant rock (5 elements), charge it, to obliterate everything on its way like in Magicka 1? It will fall pathetically two meters from your wizard, with no momentum at all, even if you charge for a while. I mean I get the idea, small stones are lighter, big rocks are heavy. But we are talking about casting a rock out of thin air, from magic. Why would you add such kind of limitation, if not to hinder the fun?\n\nReally, really disappointed...","June 6, 2015","false","6.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While graphics are nice, the gameplay is horrible.\n\nFor once, controls are more difficult to handle (e.g. once clicked on where to go, it follows through there until clicked elsewhere), which much easier leads to running into enemies or other obstacles as the controls are more indirect.\n\nOn the other side, and that is the most annoying part, you get into situations where you are locked into a section of a level unable to escape and get uninterruptedly swarmed by enemies while simultaneously having to trigger something in order to leave the area.  This is very frustrating and makes the game impossible to achieve, at least when playing alone.  Not sure, if there are greater odds surviving such menaces with 3-4 players, but the game offers single player mode as well and it should be achievable without resorting to extreme keyboard and mouse-wrecking.  It is meant to be a game afterall.\n\nI do not mind challenges, but they should be achievable through normal means.  If required to frequently go through extremes, the game loses appeal and misses its goal.\n\nThere is a reason games are considered entertainment material.  It should be enjoyable even for the average player.  Putting up impossible odds is sacrificing the game to become work.  For anyone looking for work, I would recommend the nearest work agency.  They will give you work where you even will earn money.\n\nConclusion\nIf you enjoyed playing Magicka (the first game), do not waste your time and money on this game and stick to the original title.  Much more fun that way.","July 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

All the stages have a repetitive pattern where you walk around calmly enjoying the landscape and laughing at the clever jokes on signs when suddenly all hell breaks loose and you have to fight past many enemies to get to the next stage where you do the exact same thing. Only thing that changes is the number of enemies and the possibility of adding a boss or 2 among them. The game is extremely difficult and somehow controls are a little laggy. You certainly do not have the time to combine spells and enjoy fights so you stick to the fire-arcane beamy things which are efficient 85% of the time (depending on your ability to guide them correctly because of the bad controls). This of course takes a lot out of the fun of combining elements. Bugs are also there as usual .... i found myself constantly dying from falling in an invisible hole.

The menus are alot nicer and more user friendly and playing multi-player is so much easier and if you get disconnected you can just join back in where in the last game it was a huge hassle. all in i wouldn't really recommend it cause if you want it for the story the story was garbage and if you want it for the combat and game play the combat and game play sucked.","May 31, 2015","false","6.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It's not frantic, it's not intuitive, it's not hilarious. It's sluggish and balanced with no semblance of character and cheap references that go on too long or seem too random. Playing through this with friends, I was recording, and the first laugh we had was 49 minutes in. 49 minutes of play without a single giggle, in a Magicka game, where the first time the player uses their powers they should die horribly and unexpectedly. It seems like every little alteration to the game was made by chopping out or simplifying one of the things that gave the first game its unique character and it really, really shows. This is a smooth, balanced game, devoid of joy or absurdity and too invested in keeping itself streamlined to immerse you for more than a few seconds at a time (unfortunately, I'm not exaggerating there).\n\nIt's ok, sure. Perhaps not to everyone's tastes, but definitely worth ¬£11. It's just not a good Magicka sequel, and if you enjoyed the first one at all, you will almost certainly be heartbroken by this. I wish I could use a weaker word, but honestly, it's 100% appropriate.\n\nDefining moment so far was hearing the Magicka end-of-level tune for the first time amid all the new tracks, and the first words on our Skype call were "you have not earned the right to that music".","May 30, 2015","false","7.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The whole point of getting good in Magicka was knowing good spells, improvisation and casting fast enough to heat the keyboard to thermonuclear levels. There is no fast casting now, everything is charged or channeled, even the damned mines have to lie there for a while before they are of any use. There are no good spells because every spell is equally pathetically weak now. There is no flexibility because no matter what you cast it just works the same, that is barely even works.\n\nProjectiles suck because you have to charge them for eternity to actually hurt anything.\n\nCharging mines suck because nobody ever used them as actual mines anyway.\n\nFire sucks because everything regenerates and anything but focused fire does jack sh*t.\n\nFreezing sucks because frozen things are now stupidly hard to kill. Especially in singleplayer it's just unusable.\n\nSteam sucks because its only purpose was to boost lightning.\n\nNot being able to extinguish oneself while having water immunity sucks.\n\nLightning sucks because it can't be added to beams. Arcanized lightnings have no sense, it's just adding plain, boring damage to a spell which already is all about damage. The whole point of adding arcane to lightning was increasing the range.\n\n\nTHE ENEMIES\nThe enemies suck too. They shifted from crowds of cannon fodder to being the freaking Terminator. The goblins in Magicka 1 were not there to be a threat, but to be bombarded with fireballs and run around screaming in a kinaesthetically pleasing way. The trolls, orcs, beholders, mages and all the rest - they were the real enemy. Now not only the trolls, but also the regular soldiers, the goblins and even the damned peasants are made of kevlar. You're no longer a powerful wizard, you're an idiot in a bathrobe throwing colorful lights at things.\n\nThe enemies are also really boring, you fight the same generic dudes in pointlessly fancy armor and glowing weapons 90% of the time. The other 10% is bugs. Magicka 1 had orcs, daemons, dwarves, bugs, undead and several tricky monsters too. There are no cool bosses either. Where is the Reaper, the Fafnir, the Jormungandr of this game? Only the final boss is actually interesting.\n\nEverybody has elemental attacks too. I get this was supposed to make the game more challenging, but instead it's just annoying because it DECREASES THE CONTROL THE PLAYER HAS OVER THEIR WIZARD. 90% of the time you're trying not to be burning, wet, chilled, on the ground or in the air just for a freaking second instead of ACTUALLY FIGHTING. There is no way to defend from the bombardment of annoying crowd control attacks, because the shields and armors barely block anything now, the walls are weak and the auras only really protect from one element.\n\nExcept from the disruptor magick, which blocks casting, in a game built entirely around casting, and so just pointlessly stretches the fight.\n\nEnemies have way too much health too, killing them is just slow and tedious, especially and lower difficulties. Adding a weakness to one element fixes nothing because it rewards using the same one or two spells over and over again.\n\n\nTHE GEAR\nThe eqipment sucks. Magicka 1 had a helload of weapons which were mainly here just for sh*ts and giggles. Most of them were useless and that's why obtaining a strong weapon felt like an achievement. Now every weapon is close to useless because of the balance this game never needed.\n\nThe robes suck as well. Magicka 1 had robes for everyone - some were there just for the looks (if you wanted to look sleek without any side effects), others could change the game completely. Magicka 2 robes just shuffle around some resistances and that's it. They're also not as varied and crazy as Magicka 1 robes.\n\nThe magicks suck. They can't be cast in quick succession anymore, further reducing the reward from memorizing and learning to cast quickly while also slowing the game down. There's too few of them too. Magicka 1 allowed to completely change the playstyle just by using some magicks one normally doesn't.\n\n\nTHE CONTROLS\nThe "click to go" movement sucks, it feels unresponsive and more like Diablo than the top down shooter Magicka is supposed to be. It's also annoying when you automatically send your wizard into a crowd of enemies just because you put the cursor on them to aim better.\n\nThe menu sucks, it's not ergonomic at all on PC.\n\n\nNON-GAMEPLAY THINGS\nThe humor sucks because there barely is any in the latter half of the game.\n\nEven the world sucks. Gicka 1's Midgard was a simple and full of cliches old enough not to be annoying anymore. It had barbaric orcs, sneaky goblins, evil warlocks and ugly demons. It was simultaneously a parody and a pastiche of classical fantasy from before WoW.\n\nGicka 2's Midgard is made of modern cliches, with all of its generic not-scifi-at-all magitek, overdesigned scenery and characters (which were there since TOSotC, also by the new developer) and the SUPER RAD ORIGINAL fantasy race in the form of Vanir. The Vanir suck especially hard, the game is just busy pretending they are really cool. I bet someone in the plot department likes them waaaaaaay too much.\n\nArcane being called death sucks. Everybody now uses death magic, the good guys, the bad guys, the morally ambiguous guys. Death also seems to act as the generic magical energy for some reason. The new death spells are supposed to sound ghastly, which is way less satisfying than the PEW PEW PEW of arcane. And there is no more artificial vs natural contrast of arcane vs life, which was way more interesting than just life and death.\n\nAnd why do all the soldiers have female voices? Is this some kind of a logic defying matriarchy?\nAnd why is Khan a freaking woman? It's not even a joke. It's just a huge, buff, fat orc who gets called warlady because f*ck this game i quit.\n\nI probably forgot about some things.","May 31, 2015","false","11.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

I played through all of the Sneak Peak on the highest difficulty (Banana), got all the unlockables (so far), and I cannot wait for more. "Killing your friends? You‚Äôre doing it right!" was the moto for the first game, this one is much more 'team-based' for the harder modes (which isn‚Äôt a bad thing!) It allows you to enjoy your first time around just doing whatever, whether it be killing your friends, to healing or helping the minions and then killing your friends.. The next few times through (I‚Äôve found) that you look for the unlockables... then kill your friends. And as you increase the difficulty it becomes more and more team based and you actually need to think about the correct answer to solving a puzzle. The first Magicka game set the bar high for the ones to come (MWW and this) and so far I‚Äôm liking M2 so much it‚Äôs going to break my rating scale... But, this game did have 2 down sides when playing it... The first on being, at Banana Mode you need to work WITH friends (and if you've caught on you'll know I don‚Äôt have the best of times doing that) the second being that the replayability factor is a little low for me... After beating it on each difficulty and unlocking all the unlocks, and even beating challenge mode with friends its really only replayable if you haven‚Äôt beat it... (Ignoring than that singular factor I‚Äôd give this game 9001/10 but seeing how much it really means to have that replayability (and believe me the comedic part of the game almost won me over and looked past the replayability..) I‚Äôm going to rate it at 9/10 because of the replayability, but there is so much good comedy and features I almost want to look past the replayability.. Really...

This seems to be the game's big gimmick, and it's just busy work instead of giving me something fun to do.\n\nIf you aren't terribly good at memorizing multiple button bushes, some of which require a bit of outside-the-box contemplation on why these combined elements even give this particular effect, then I would recommend avoiding this game. You'll be fighting a few puny enemies and won't recall what combo to enter just to take them out, possibly even killing yourself in the process. I'm sure this system of combining elements took a lot of hard work and thought on the developer's part, but spending a lot of time making something does not inherently make it a good product, and unless memorizing button combos is your thing, or just killing your co op "buddies" for no real reason makes spending fifteen dollars "worth it" to you, then I would not suggest getting this game.","March 13","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Things I don't like is that the old precedence of elements is no more, I use to Use Rasa (cold+lightning+Arcane) alot and shout it out every time, disturbing my neighbors in process.

Another thing i don't like about the  new spell mechanic is that when you are making steam, fire and water don't collapse into one icon, and really limits  the number of spells you can do. You can't do Lightning and steam/ice anymore, i think the longest spell in magicka was 10 elements (if u did steam or ice 5 times) now in magicka 2 at most its 5 of anything and if we tried to emulate the 10 element limit from previously at most you could only make 2 steams and one other element that isnt lightning/cold.
