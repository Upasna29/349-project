I know I should be more positive about this, but MANY other games have had better launched. I would rather sit through a new Battlefield game's launch than play this. Ugh.

Wasd movement controls while using 1 2 3 as fire buttons is terrible finger ballet.  If I'm aiming with the mouse, why not fire with mouse buttons?  No ability to lock targets even if it doesn't aim at them.  No indicator of effective weapon range.  Would be interesting mechanic to let players balance power to engine, shield, weapons .  Currently it gives me hope that something could be done with it though.  Go look at Fractured Space and borrow from it a bit.

The camera whilst fine on the little fighters and bombers (and to some extent the frigates) made controlling the larger ships all but impossible, you couldn't see where you were going because the camera was stuck behind your ship, so your view was constantly blocked by your ship, this in turn made aiming with the weapons very difficult, which wasn't helped at all by the UI.  The UI was just bad, there was no way to see how well you were doing in battle, which enemy you were targeting and the amount of damage you personally were doing to that target was a case of guesswork, the UI and camera certainly didn't help you in that regard, there wasn't any way for players to comunicate with each other which didn't help matters much.\n\nNow that review was from when the game first came out and I realised that I was maybe being too harsh on the game, so I start it up again to see how and if it has changed since I last played it, only to find that the game is dead, that's right, dead, there is no one online.","March 30","false","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

[Would work based on size/speed {Bottom=DroneDebris/FighterDebris/CorvetteDebris/FrigateDebris/DestroyerDebris/CapitalShipDebris=Top}])\n-A tutorial, and sensible controls\n-Flying into a larger ship's engines should slowly kill you.\n-Port and Starboard mounted cannons that slightly swivel\n\nOther than that, it functions great as a quick, fun game with decent ship interplay. I highly suggest you bring a group of friends into this, especially if you can get enough friends to fill a server.\n\nFor an early access, free, space combat centric game, I give it 8.2/10\n","March 12","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controls..... if they fixed this the game might actually be ok but i ended up stuck on a meteor and some guy on the other team kept shooting at me, once i was fully stuck he came up behind me and got stuck as well, he kept shooting me and after 5 mintues of hitting me i was down to 94%... lol. He eventually gave up and quit the game, 10 seconds later so did I. Between him and I the whole round lasted about 3 minutes trying to figure out the controls before we both said F. it. Fix the controls and i'm sure this game might not be that bad, i'll even leave it installed and see what kind of updates come out this but wow. really bad.","January 19","false","0.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

This is a great indie game.\n\nCodename: Rogue Fleet is a 3-D space enviorment where 2 fleets engage in a massive battle within an asteroid belt. This game is completely Free to play, and no micro transactions at all. Players choose from a lists of preset ships and use many different forms of weapons to vaporize their foes.\n\nPros:\nIts only 500mb\nGraphics are Good\nLots of different ships\nFeels like an actual space combat, not sci-fi, (It's not totally realistic, but it does feel like it, and plays really well because of it.)\n\nCons:\nCamera viewing angle.\nship speed can throw pacing off a bit at times\n\n\nWith the camera controls inverted, it feels really weird after playing so many games with normal view controls.\n\nThings that aren't cons, but could make the game better:\nTarget tracking system(accquiring a lock won't help with missiles, but you will know the location of your enemies)\nTutorial (would be nice, but not required, literally pause the game and click options)\nTeam rosters (So you know how many enemies are left)\nPersonalization of ships (names, paint schemes, decals, all personal preferences by me, but the default models are really well done).\n\nOverall this game is some good fun in its current state, and I feel it will only get better as time goes on. I would definitely download it and try it out!\n","January 18","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't expect to spend 1000's of hours on it but I do find it entertaining. Can take getting used to the gameplay, controls, menus and ought else but seems worth it to me. I'm not finding the problems other people have complained of so far. Finding a match can take some time, and filling it up with people who are "ready" but that's it.\n\nI'd like to see lots more content but it's playable as-is. The devs don't get money for it so I'll take what it's got.\n\nIf they were wanting to significatnly expand it content wise then it might be worth kickstarting.\n\nAs-is, fun, simple, functional multiplayer shooter in space with space ships.

I didn't have a lot of trouble with the controls though. It is quite basic controls for when you are used to flying. The biggest problem I had was the lack of feedback from the battlefield. As a single ship you are pretty much designated to kill a particular ship of the enemy. Firstly, killing one of those ships takes too long. As interceptor you can easily keep up with the flying of your designated enemy (the corvettes) but you have to unload a hell of a lot of bullets and rockets to get one player down. By the time I took the two Corvettes down I noticed nearly all of the team had either left or been destroyed which left me with some enemy ships I could not even damage because of my choice of ship.\n\nDo not waste any time on this game until it has developed to an acceptable level.","January 16","false","0.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Every player on the team plays a certain role similar to the ship structure in Homeworld. Players may chose from playing a fighter, corvette, frigate, the destroyer, or the capital ship of their fleet. Each ship has pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFor an unadvertised indie game this very simplistic space shooter has a lot of potential if it can attract a crowd. If I had anything bad to say about it, its that its control scheme is pretty clunky, and requires all fingers to be on the keyboard to get anything done, which makes mouse aiming awkward.

This game is your textbook example of a true alpha-stage game.\nThere is only a skeleton of a game here, but it is a complete skeleton; very bony, unappealing, the joints need lubrication, yet the presence of cartilage tissue is a pleasant surprise.\n\nGameplay: very slow, very forgiving, marginally satisfying to learn.\n\nGraphics: Unity graphics, so it is decent. Asteroid surfaces are only textures. Note: The sun glare is horrible.\n\nLearning Curve: On par with stepping on a Lego while wearing thick socks; sharp, unfriendly to humans, yet simple.\n\nHUD Interface: Stupidly transparent; easy to understand once your eyes adjust.\n\nMenu Navigation: Stupidly transparent, odd font sizes, odd naming of buttons; your eyes never adjust, easily the worst part.\n\nAesthetic: Plain, but but satisfying; it sits on the "less is more" peak of visual appeal.\n\nConclusion:  This game is worth exactly $0.05 of emotional investment! Recommended to download for tracking development!\n\nThe dev is alive, but this is a one man game. The game is using the Personal version of the Unity Engine?

Sure, the controls are quite confusing at points, but I've had some fun with the game.\n\nSome suggestions I have:\n- Make the remaining team win in case the last of the other team quits before being destroyed; a few times, I have had to quit after all of the enemy team had left, giving our team no win, per se (not that it really matters), or we end up having a shootout between friendlys untill one of us dies, which triggers the winning screen for some reason.\n- Either speed up menuvers for corvettes, or slow fighters down a notch.\n- Each ship's weapon bindings be somthing along the lines of the following: 1 = Main Weapon (Energy Cannons for larger ships/corvettes, autocannons for the fighters) 2 = Naval Rifles (for lack of a better name) for larger, torpedos for Fighters 3 = Missiles (as far as I know, only destroyers and above have this, maybe the laser Corvette?) 4 = Deploy Drones (When applicable.)","February 10","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All of the bad reviews say that the controls are hard or impossible to use when infact all you have to do is look in the options and chance the controls to how you want to fly but then again, some people dont like doing such things.\n\n--Personal Thoughts--\nA way to win. I went into several games and shot up a few people but no one was dying or blowing apart so toning down the amount of heath and armor each ship has would be good so noone is spending 20 minutes trying to destroy one ship.\n\nAdd a tutorial. As you can tell by the negitive reviews, alot of people dont even try to go for the options and learn the controls that way and instead think that the game will teach you how to play, so a tutorial would be nice so people wont just rage leave and complain on the store page about it.\n\nBots. Some times I dont feel like going PvP and just want some good old PvE and shootin up some mindless drones (Hopfully with the option on how smart they are via a difficulity setting) to test out each ship and see how it fairs agains the others.\n\nVictory timer or kill/point system. Victory time so that you can just destroy people for a set amount of time or kill/point system to get a set amount of kills to win each match so more people will know what the odvious point of each match is.\n\nCommunication. As of now their is no way to talk to your team or the other team so adding a text or mic relay to chat with people would be really nice.\n\n--End Personal Thoughts--\n\nAnyway, the game is still new so their will be some things that need to be added but it is still alot of fun to be had if you get a good amount of people per team plus the fact that their are 10 different ships to choose from so if you want to have epic space battles their will be no problem.\n\n\n","February 10","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every player on the team plays a certain role similar to the ship structure in Homeworld. Players may chose from playing a fighter, corvette, frigate, the destroyer, or the capital ship of their fleet. Each ship has pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFor an unadvertised indie game this very simplistic space shooter has a lot of potential if it can attract a crowd. If I had anything bad to say about it, its that its control scheme is pretty clunky, and requires all fingers to be on the keyboard to get anything done, which makes mouse aiming awkward.

This game is your textbook example of a true alpha-stage game.\nThere is only a skeleton of a game here, but it is a complete skeleton; very bony, unappealing, the joints need lubrication, yet the presence of cartilage tissue is a pleasant surprise.\n\nGameplay: very slow, very forgiving, marginally satisfying to learn.\n\nGraphics: Unity graphics, so it is decent. Asteroid surfaces are only textures. Note: The sun glare is horrible.\n\nLearning Curve: On par with stepping on a Lego while wearing thick socks; sharp, unfriendly to humans, yet simple.\n\nHUD Interface: Stupidly transparent; easy to understand once your eyes adjust.\n\nMenu Navigation: Stupidly transparent, odd font sizes, odd naming of buttons; your eyes never adjust, easily the worst part.\n\nAesthetic: Plain, but but satisfying; it sits on the "less is more" peak of visual appeal.\n\nConclusion:  This game is worth exactly $0.05 of emotional investment!

HOLY CRAP. This is actually really good! and I've only played it for a short time. The hud is slightly horrible due to it becoming invisible against the pure-white-star-thingy and it does need some inproving but overall it works. The classes are also quite interesting. I mean the interceptor is kinda ridiculouswith it's speed and all but it can be taken down with some team effort. The controls are good but slightly off but with rebinding and slight adjustment to sensitivity they work. The game is flawed. There's no communication. There is a need to at the very least converse somehow or these games are nearly impossible with a large group. And considering that this is free and only occupies a tiny amount of space it's really good. I should probably stop writing at this point. So.

This isn't a big deal to some people but you cant change it in the settings. Also, you cant fire with the mouse, you have to use the 1 2 3 and 4 buttons and cant change it. There isn't even a tutorial to teach you the controls.\n\nNot being able to play with AI also stinks. Sometimes I dont feel like playing online, or maybe the internet is down.

I hate it when people treat it as if its some kind of AAA game with thousands of developers and a huge budget. Its a small, great, fun game, that has many places to improve in.\n\nI think that the TTK (Time To Kill) is too long in this game. This game is too slow paced for its gameplay style. Everything moves like a snail (exept for fighters and bombers, which are broken) and it takes 3 minutes of full fireing to do anything. Battles should be quicker, more intense, and dynamic. Increase the firerate for all ships, make the Flak ship fire its weapons in salvos, have AI-controlled wingmen for bombers/interceptors, not 2 other aircraft attached to yours via metal poles. The AI would make the game more challenging, and add an element of balance to the already broken fighters and bombers. Also, the manuverability of fighters and bombers should be nerfed, or their armor/shield should be reduced.","January 23","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, it does have alot of potential. I was unable to play because of the terrible controls (spent like 20 minutes remapping and even trying a gamepad), I just couldnt stand inverted controls and also how aiming and camera are independent from another, making aiming an unecessary ordeal. I think this is the reason my many are leaving negative reviews, and thats understandable. However, this game has what it takes to shine, its free and fast to download. This is a nice alternative to those with lower spec PCs that cant play those big titles like Dreadnought, Star Conflict, Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous.

Unity is just terrible especially when starting (i mean look at those porly ported android games made with unity) ao granted i hated the engine the game its self wasnt bad. i mean no chat and all, no way to inform team on strategy, but its a game surely made by one developer. and i can respect that to the upmost appeal. controls are still clunky even to this date for my tastes but still very well made. a tweak to the Menu contrast (due to the contrast bieng so weird. blue on blue? no offense but why) and maybe some edit on the field or a chat box??? maybe???... please??..........

I feel that this could be sped up by at least 2x to make things a bit more exciting (at it stands you can just sit there and shoot at eachother for 7-8 minutes before someone dies)\n-couldn't get camera to zoon with mouse wheel (but movement was fine)--would be nice to have an auto camera option so you don't have to adjust it as you move (not a dealbreaker though since game is slow)\n\nVerdict: A fun way to waste a little time and shoot spaceships.  It's free and a pretty small download so give it a try.  While it isn't perfect, it is far better than probably 80% of unity games that you see pop up on steam and is completely playable, stable, and functional.","January 18","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt there was lot wrong with this game and there was really nothing that felt right, at all. To start off I must say the same thing every one else is commenting on, and that is that the controls are bad. Personally I wasted 30 min just adjusting the key bindings before I felt they where good enough to actually join a multiplayer match.\n\nThen I noticed I had 60 ping and even had very nice fps while I started a solo match for the sake of getting use to the controls. However, the moment I jumped into a multiplayer match the ping jumped to it's Max limit and fps was 0-2. I tried everything from min the gfx, to hosting my own match but the fps would always drop to an unplayable level once other people join the match.\n\nThe ships movement also felt way to slow for every ship in the game except the lightest fighters which I can only imagine would make the 30 or so people who play this game feel like they are an immobile missile turret going up against other immobile missile turrets. Again, I can only assume is the case as I was unable to actually play a single match due my fps.\n\nThis is a real shame because I love all forms of space themed games. And I do feel that with a few years work this game might turn into something really good, then again there are a lot of other games out there already like this that are doing  quite well. I fear that by the time this game can catch up it will be too outdated.\n\nAnd the last reason why I can't recommend this to anyone is the low playerbase. You can't have a multiplayer game without players. And while it's true that I wasn't in this game for very long, I was able to take note that there was actually less then 30 players in the game. With such a low population I just don't see this game going anywhere.\n\nPS: Did I mention there is currently no chat system?","January 23","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now once i saw the Unity splash screen i gave a big sigh because lets be honest. Unity is just terrible especially when starting (i mean look at those porly ported android games made with unity) ao granted i hated the engine the game its self wasnt bad. i mean no chat and all, no way to inform team on strategy, but its a game surely made by one developer. and i can respect that to the upmost appeal. controls are still clunky even to this date for my tastes but still very well made. a tweak to the Menu contrast (due to the contrast bieng so weird. blue on blue? no offense but why) and maybe some edit on the field or a chat box??? maybe???... please??..........

Me neither!  But if you want to know what that's like, play Rogue Fleet!\n\nLaser corvettes seem useless against anything not a corvette, they can't even tickle a frigate.  Intercepters seem to do more damage to capital ships then bombers?  Torpedoes are almost useless considering how hard it is to aim them and how easy they are to dodge. (its satisfying when you line up a perfect shot, but they seem to do little damage anyway)  No way to communicate with fleetmates...  And for God's sake, add an alert when you attack your own team... or make it more obvious when a player is on the red team...  Half the time I am on the red team I will have teammates attacking me...\n\ndespite it's flaws I absolutely love this game.  Nothing like flying an ion frigate under the guns of a battleship and taking it out, or intuiting with a teammate the perfect ambush.

I felt there was lot wrong with this game and there was really nothing that felt right, at all. To start off I must say the same thing every one else is commenting on, and that is that the controls are bad. Personally I wasted 30 min just adjusting the key bindings before I felt they where good enough to actually join a multiplayer match.\n\nThen I noticed I had 60 ping and even had very nice fps while I started a solo match for the sake of getting use to the controls. However, the moment I jumped into a multiplayer match the ping jumped to it's Max limit and fps was 0-2. I tried everything from min the gfx, to hosting my own match but the fps would always drop to an unplayable level once other people join the match.\n\nThe ships movement also felt way to slow for every ship in the game except the lightest fighters which I can only imagine would make the 30 or so people who play this game feel like they are an immobile missile turret going up against other immobile missile turrets. Again, I can only assume is the case as I was unable to actually play a single match due my fps.\n\nThis is a real shame because I love all forms of space themed games. And I do feel that with a few years work this game might turn into something really good, then again there are a lot of other games out there already like this that are doing  quite well. I fear that by the time this game can catch up it will be too outdated.\n\nAnd the last reason why I can't recommend this to anyone is the low playerbase. You can't have a multiplayer game without players. And while it's true that I wasn't in this game for very long, I was able to take note that there was actually less then 30 players in the game. With such a low population I just don't see this game going anywhere.\n\nPS: Did I mention there is currently no chat system?","January 23","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this regular DOES NOT apply to this game, W makes your ship go upwards and S is for downwards! Q&E rolls your ship, which is the only reasonable mapping.\n\nAlso, there's no lock-on, range indicator or guided weapon whatsoever - of course the missiles and torpedoes will travel toward the place you're aiming, but that's all, they won't seek your target.\n\nFurther more, there's no HP bar for yourself or your enemy. That really bothers me a lot, because I don't even know if I'm doing damage to my opponents.\n\nFortunately this game is completely free.","January 23","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay, the story, and the great characters brought back amazing memories of my past. I used to have a brain dead brother who loved playing games with great characters. This game brought back those memories.\nNow back to the review.\nThis game had an amazing opening cut scene. Immediately you are brought into a world of mystical planets and asteroids that look like baked potatoes. And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. It was majestic and brought tears into my eyes.\nSPOILERS!!!!\nThe moment Officer Uncle Frank died by my hands, I was so happy and I cried.

Just read through a couple reviews and decided to try it. I am blown away by this game mainly because it's totally free! No little store to buy different skins, or some super ships... Nope, totally free!\n\nAnyways, there is an issue with this game: The Multiplayer, which is the only way to play, seriously, there is no single player try out the different ships. What I mean by the multiplayer is that there are so few people actually playing it, you usually get 1V1 or a totally unfair setup like 1V3.\n\nIf you're reading this, first thing you should do is CHANGE THE CONTROLS! They are all weird, but once you rebind them, you're golden. :D","February 13","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like before you join a game, plus this game has lots of potental. There are a few things that could get fixed, but they should add more because this game is pretty amazing for how much it has right now. Just THINK how much more amazing this game could be if you worked on it as much as you could and every week you put out a update of anything like Bug Fixes, Inprovements, Tweaks, and most of all New Things that would make the game better.\n\nMy thought is you should try adding Team Voice Chat, Normal Chat, and other cool stuff.\n\nGood luck dude, and keep the good ideas going.","February 13","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is your textbook example of a true alpha-stage game.\nThere is only a skeleton of a game here, but it is a complete skeleton; very bony, unappealing, the joints need lubrication, yet the presence of cartilage tissue is a pleasant surprise.\n\nGameplay: very slow, very forgiving, marginally satisfying to learn.\n\nGraphics: Unity graphics, so it is decent. Asteroid surfaces are only textures. Note: The sun glare is horrible.\n\nLearning Curve: On par with stepping on a Lego while wearing thick socks; sharp, unfriendly to humans, yet simple.\n\nHUD Interface: Stupidly transparent; easy to understand once your eyes adjust.\n\nMenu Navigation: Stupidly transparent, odd font sizes, odd naming of buttons; your eyes never adjust, easily the worst part.\n\nAesthetic: Plain, but but satisfying; it sits on the "less is more" peak of visual appeal.\n\nConclusion:  This game is worth exactly $0.05 of emotional investment! Recommended to download for tracking development!\n\nThe dev is alive, but this is a one man game. The game is using the Personal version of the Unity Engine? Can anyone explain how this got on steam as FREE download; does the dev have to pay for the opportunity?","February 29","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to join lobbies, where you wait forever for everyone to get ready. Even then, people have no clue on how to play.\n\nStill, this game has potential. Devs could probably salvage this situation by adding tutorials, and a match-making queue system.","January 16","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
