Played like five minutes of it and bailed. Writing my first review ever just to warn people. This game would've been horrible 20 years ago. The camera movement and gunfights feel like a crappy mod of an even crappier game made in the 90s. Do NOT buy this. Wow.....\n\nEDIT: 2 of my posts in the discussion board have been actively deleted! I just posted them and watched them get removed! Crazy.\n\nEDIT 2: FOUR of my posts have been deleted now. The last one was gone with 30 seconds of me posting it.\n\nDO    NOT   BUY.","May 31","false","0.1"," 112 of 129 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","112","129","10","7"

Played it for about 5 minutes and couldn't bear to play it any more, the controls seemed very unresponsive and the gunfights were awful. Also had graphics issues were textures were missing","May 31","false","0.1"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","38","43","3","0"
