The culprit is different every time so there is  some replayability. However thief is revealed in the very end so you have to play the whole game and it is kinda long in comparison with previous games. There are 2 slightly different paths and most walkthroughs don't cover the second one (the one where you have to use pepper to get harmonica); bubblegum is useless in this one.\nInteractivity is still at the top - every single background detail has it's own animation. There is also a music player + recorder with many samples, asteroids-like game and something else I missed.\nMusic is comfy, art is pretty. Cool game pls play.","July 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","13","14","4","2"

It is great now but in the ending sequence when Freddi and Luther were revealing who Mr. Big was, when Freddi was talking: Luther was talking in Freddi's voice. And Freddi was still talking and her mouth wasn't moving. The game was great minus that part.","July 11, 2014","true","3.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I don't know why considering that this is the weakest since the first from a gameplay standpoint; the randomization is really stripped back to a few minor minor things; there's only one puzzle that changes out of everything in the game, even.\nThough from a writing/flavor/humor standpoint this is probably the best so far, I still chuckled at some of the jokes here. That might be why I recall it the most of the series.","July 30, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A spectacular game. Absolutely phenomenal. No other game has made me feel this way about my life. A life changing experience that will never be forgotten. My personal rating is 10/10 and I hope to play every other game of this series. Thank you Humongous Entertainment for such a brilliant work of art.","December 31, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They all love it! But new stuff keeps coming out and the old games don't work on new computers and its a shame because the newer games that we find online are usually not suitable for little kids. Now I have had to buy a new copy of Freddie online  with Steam and its horrible! The animation is jerky as if it is constantly streaming and the mouse doesn't work. I want the good ol CDs that I can just pop in while off line like Freddie and Pajama Sam and Blues Clues and Sesame Street and Barbie.","April 12","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
