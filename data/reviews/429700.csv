I've played other games with the two character at once concept (Brothers for example) and this game pulls it off very well.\n\nI can't recommend this game due to its overly touchy difficulty level.  I don't enjoy figuring out a puzzle within 30 seconds and then spending 20 minutes dying over and over to actually pull it off.  Lemmings suffered from thsi issue too.  After a while the difficulty is more about incredibly precise inputs instead of actually using your brain.","January 6","false","4.6"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","26","44","4","5"

The controls and mechanics work well, allowing it to create interesting puzzles where you would have to think from both Squirbs' perpectives. The first few levels start off easy, to give the player a sense of the game. The 'deaths' remind me a little of the 'bloody trapland' game as more and more blood is splattered onto the ground.\n\nThe later levels, as mentioned by other players, start to rely more on your control over the Squirbs in order to complete it. It does provide a great challenge (mentioned in the description) to the player and could be pretty frustrating.\n\nIf you like difficult platformer/puzzle games (with more of an emphasis on the platformer portion), I would definitely recommend this game.","January 7","true","3.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Need to move both characters through traps obstacles, using the obstacles to make one character to the goal, then keeping that character from hitting traps, whilst the other character completes goal. Its a simple very simple game, but very challenging and addicting. . . with achievements to boot, you cant go wrong for a few dollars. Go get this game its a lot intelligent mindnumbing fun.","January 8","true","4.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

A few minor things I didn't enjoy like getting killed on the top of spikes when they are facing the other way but that just adds to the challenge. Even though I'm not very good at it, the game is extremely challenging and tests your reflexes and will keep you sharp! I can definitely recommend this game!","January 10","true","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I love the main character, it's so godamn cute and the idea of the game itself is great. And it works to perfection. The mechanics work very well and the difficulty curve of the game is executed amazingly. I found it easy to get into this game and as I progressed I found each level harder and harder as more mechanics we're introduced. This totally sold the game for me because it was very challenging but at the same time so fun to play! I'm happy to support the developers of this game and future content that they may release. Gimmie that pink Squirb aha. Great job.","January 7","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You can play this with friends and see who can complete levels in the least amount of attempts :O\nI completed World 1 (forest) in the first 2 hours I played, and attempted World 2..\nThe game gets drastically harder lol.  Good freaking luck completing it!\n\nDeath explosion is awesome, has cards, fun puzzle gameplay, only 6 bucks!\nGet it if you enjoy a challenging puzzle-platformer.\n\nGameplay video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1uBseaGKII","January 10","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Very cool puzzles invovled in controlling both characters at once.  Unfortunately at some point it goes from clever to repetitive and frustrating.  If you're not incredibly precise, good luck.  Would probably be easier if you have a second player.  In that case I might recommend it.","April 21","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
