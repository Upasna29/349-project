"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loimprevisto/recommended/385220/","loimprevisto","loimprevisto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loimprevisto/","1752 products in account","This is a casual platformer that is fun but feels very unpolished. I'm sure a lot of work went into it, but it plays like a middle-of-the-pack student/hobbyist project. The music is pleasant and fits the mood of the game fine, no real problems there. My 8 year old will probably enjoy the game for a few hours (if the bugs get fixed). I got it as part of a game bundle, but I wouldn't pay money to buy it separately.\n\nSome specific criticisms are:\n\nThere are stars in each level, but the game never gives you an indication of what they are for or why you should look for them/collect them. Do they have any function?\n\nThere's a typo in one of the signs that the game uses to provide gameplay instructions "Press F to swift on flying mode". swift --> switch. It's minor, but I really expect a paid game to be well polished and not have these little rough edges.\n\nThe save/load featuer lets you resume where you left off, but it only has one save slot. If you'r e in the middle of your game and want to resume it later, but accidentally click to start a new game instead of the 'Load' button, your previous game is lost.\nEDIT: After starting the new game, the summoning power is not usable. Pressing L opens the menu, but all 4 choices are there even though I only unlocked the bird. None of the options work to actually summon anything, and this makes the game unplayable.","August 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

EXPLOSIVES EVERYWHERE!\nI finished the game in just 20 minutes by defeating the last boss (I call it flying dark lord).\nKilling the last boss only get you to the credits. There is no story in this game.\n\nYou control a badass invicible little blue slime. In the 1st level, you can only stomp to kill but after that you got sword, summon, shuriken, and flying bubble. Pretty much you become the most powerful slime in the entire galaxy.\n\nThere is copyrighted characters in this game such as Patrick Starfish from Spongebob Squarepants, Elsa from Frozen and some Angry birds' bird.","August 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","11","18","5","1"

Visuals are a mix of resolutions, perspectives, lighting and style.  The interface is sloppy and shows incorrect labels for input.  Input that is poorly laid out and can't keep up with all the buttons a player might press at the same time.\n\nThe core gameplay is a simple platformer but the weak level design and spotty collision detection drain it of challenge and enjoyment.  The occasional boss levels offer nothing to shake up the experience.","February 25","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
