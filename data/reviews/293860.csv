"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/293860/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","White Noise Online is multiplayer-based Slender-type game, by which I mean it's a horror game where you go around collecting eight randomly placed objects while avoiding a monster that's hunting you. Slenderman isn't actually involved here, and there's some twists to the formula here to keep it interesting, but the baseline is that this is an online co-op Slender-type game, and that fact will either sell you or turn you away from the game.\n\nYou play as one of over 20 characters in some very dark environment collecting cassettes. Strange statues line the environments, and a strange glowing monster chases you through the depths of darkness, with an intent to kill. However, the story here is rather non-existent, with the only narrative coming from an opening scene before the title screen, and the audio content that plays on the cassettes themselves when you pick them up.\n\nThe cassettes emit a static sound to alert you that they're nearby, which is helpful to the formula as the stages in this game are bigger than most Slender-type games and the monster is notably more aggressive. One feature kind of cool and creepy about the monster is that he makes appropriately unnerving sounds to both sort of alert you where he is, and unnerve you. It can be creepy to be in a tight-corridor area and not see him, but it sounds like he's right next to you. Staring at the monster will slowly deplete your 'health', and he'll kill you if you let him get too close to you. There are also green-glowing statues placed around the environment randomly, and staring at them or getting too close will have the same effects the monster has (though of course the statues can't move). The statues emit a static-sound similar to the cassettes (though different enough to tell) to lead players to a tricky end.\n\nThere are four difficulty levels, which mostly determine the difficulty of the monster, how many statues there are, and cassette placement possibility.\n\nThe game also has a panic-system that's kind of similar to what you'll find in Clock Tower 3 or Haunting Ground. When you are isolated and alone, your character will start panicking (which can be noted when the character starts making panicked sounds and the screen starts acting up), and eventually starts tripping all over the place and making a lot of noise, which attracts the monster. This can be settled by either collecting cassettes, or finding other people.\n\nHow prone they are to this depends on what character you play as. There are over 20 different characters, and they all have different stats. These are represented by an image for each 'category' (the images can be confusing at first, can read up on what each one means in the How to Play section on the options menu), with a notice of if they're stronger or weaker in this area than other characters (represented by a +1 to +3, or a -1 to -3, if not shown then they are neutral, or default, in that area). Areas effected include sanity (take less damage from the monsters attacks), flashlight battery life (the longer you keep your flashlight on, the more it will flicker and start becoming dimmer and dimmer), movement speed, stamina (for running), scout (the further distance you can get from characters before panicking), evasion (how high you are on the monsters priority list), and more. You only start with four characters, while the other ones are unlocked by playing the game and accomplishing tasks.\n\nThere's also some fun multiplayer mechanics that are rather well thought-out. Firstly, death. When a player dies, they then become a ghost, which is visible to the living players as a blue silhouette of the character that died. The ghosts can stick around the living players to help prevent them from panicking, or they can go out and scout for cassettes. The ghosts see the level much more brightly than the living do, and they also move a lot faster around the level. However, they cannot see the monster, but can spot cassettes. This can be helpful in downtime and to be helpful even after death. The second feature cool for multiplayer is the results screen, which displays fun information like the total distance each person walked, number of cassettes each individual collected, how many times they were hit by a scare attack and 'screamed', how long they survived, etc., along with a map that shows the routes that each player took during the course of the game.\n\nThe game currently has six maps, though the devs have noted if it does well they plan to add more. The maps are fairly varied, with themes like tropical island, government base, museum, snowy forest, and the like. There are three different map 'styles', with two maps under each style. The first is big-open levels that have monuments, like the original Slender. The second are closed-spaces interior maps with twisting corridors, rooms, and labyrinth-like structures. The final are 'island' stages, which has parts of levels connected with tunnels, bridges, and the like, with the level segments being separated like islands.\n\nThis game was an Xbox Live release originally, the main difference in the Steam version right now is that all characters are now unlockable (as opposed to some characters only obtainable by owning other games), achievements, and they've updated the graphics some. This said, more updates may arise in the future to further differentiate it.\n\nIn short, it's a very confident Slender game, actually one of my favorites. The online multiplayer is fun and well-thought out, and the game still manages to be tense and scary at times. If you like Slender-based games and have wanted or are interested in trying a multiplayer-based version of that type of game, this is it. There really isn't any better, and the game does very well at what it sets out to do. However, if you don't enjoy Slender-type games, or the multiplayer focus doesn't interest you, this probably won't interest you. The game maybe works better in short bursts than long marathons, but it's still a fun little multiplayer horror game.","May 23, 2014","true","8.3"," 114 of 133 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","114","133","0","0"

Of course you don't. Slender is boring. You walk around slowly, then slenderguy pops out and goes "A BLOOGY WOOGY WOO" and you die. Now, take slender, and imagine it WORSE. Instead of walking slowly, you waddle like you've just wet the bed. There's no strafing or backwards walk animations either, since your character is always the king of pop. But wait, there's more! Instead of walking at a (somewhat) reasonable pace like in slender, you now walk at a maximum of 1 mile per hour! Oh, but I hear you say, why not sprint? Because sprinting makes you go TWO MPH, and more than quintuples the chance of the monster coming out and going a bloogy woogy woo. Speaking of the monster, the devs really didn't try with this. The monster's always this fullbright hulk-with-a-no-face thing that just kind of stares at you until you look away and walk like a geriatric patient somewhere else. Oh, but the monster comes after you if you look away, just like slender! if you look at the spooky monster too long, you'll start getting really fuzzy things around your screen then the monster pops up and goes a bloogy woogy to your face, then you die. Bonus for dying: You can actually SEE what's going on. The entire game is literal pitch-black. That's not scary, that's just inconvenient, like the limited sprint and limited flashlight which is already poor as dirt. Oh, but there's multiple characters you can't unlock until you've already gotten horribly bored with this travesty, so don't worry about it. There's no real gameplay change between characters except some can run a bit longer and some can look at weird cthulu statues or the monster without going "aghhfhf" and turning into stone. Oh. And if the other points weren't enough to put you off this game, allow me to make 2 more. One. This game is a unity game, and BOY does it show. The models are decently done enough, but everything feels just slopped in. Hell, in one map you can even see the edge of the map through a gate and just stop into a black skybox. And two, if you really REALLY want this game for god knows why, you're better off just googling the original unity slender and playing that. It's the same damn game only with better gameplay and less 3.00 xbox indie game crap port. If you are a guy who enjoys poking fun at really godawful and not spooky at all games, by all means. Playing as spaghetti-noodles velma will offer you and your friends a good laugh. If you're looking for an engaging time waster, then go buy something else worthwhile. Hell, even the new slender that just came out is better than this, and it's made on the same engine.

White Noise Online is essentially Slender with coop: wander around a map with only your flashlight for guidance, looking for the eight tape recorders while avoiding the monster stalking you. It's a notable idea to shake up a style of game that's become rather routine, but White Noise fails to realize that the addition of other players completely destroys everything the original Slender did so well, and the few things it does new aren't enough to compensate.\n\nThe most instantly apparent of these is the complete absence of any tension, with the presence of other players turning a horrific experience into a placid walking exercise. This also negatively effects the atmosphere, losing the thick dread of ever present danger and replacing it with a comically lazy monster that does little to impede your progress. This culminates in a dull, monotonous game, that sees you spending the bulk of your time walking in circles through the nondescript environments that make it near impossible to make any progress and becomes incredibly tedious as you constantly retrace your steps.\n\nWhite Noise Online is a developer failing to realize what makes a genre compelling. Slender succeeds because it excels at making you feel isolated and vulnerable, and keeps you engaged by the terror of the monster hunting you. All of these aspects are lost on White Noise, which really leaves you with nothing but a shell of a game that serves no purpose but to bore and annoy the player.\n\nDon't waste your time with White Noise, and for Pete's sake don't drag your friends in with you.","July 11, 2014","false","2.1"," 51 of 74 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","51","74","0","7"

If you're lucky, maybe you'll find somebody in the forums to organise a play time with but there's no chance of stumbling across a multiplayer game without arranging it. The main drawback to this is that single player seems much more difficult than multiplayer. In my first multiplayer game I survived over half an hour on the hardest difficulty yet in a more recent single player game I couldn't last ten minutes on the easiest setting. I managed to find four tape recorders by myself and then the monster teleported in front of me and without warning hit me with a one shot kill. Maybe I was just unlucky.

This slenderman type game is not your typical slenderman game, Most slenderman games that i had played in the past are more of "creepy" than anything else, But this game has more jumpscares and "scary" more than anything else.\n\nI have also tested this game on my macbook pro 2012 and the results werent good at first, the game kept crashing and it didnt work at all.As suggested by WaaghMan  [developer] , updated my mono framework @ http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html and the game began to even run on ultra graphics.\n\nIt still has the 6 original maps but as i said before i hope that they can add more maps and a few more characters in the future and possibly even new gamemodes.I Cant wait to see where this game goes from here.Anyway This release is Amazing and they have done a good job porting it over to pc, also this game runs great on mac computers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownagecookies/recommended/293860/","ownagecookies","Cook13s","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownagecookies/","504 products in account","There's not much of a story to this game, put simply you and three others investigate different locations in order to discover the truth by collecting tape recorders which contain information. The recording itself is not important, it does add some back story but not needed for gameplay, you must collect 8 recorders while avoiding the evil manifestation that slowly pursues you.\n\nSound familiar? I bet you have. Its very similar to how a slender game plays with the addition to having coop, that said it doesn't mean the game isn't fun, the opposite if for a short while. I would suggest not binging, as you will exhaust all the fun in one play-through. Decent quality graphics and atmosphere, its recommended playing in the dark with headphones and no voice enabled, especially if you are playing with others, you don't want to ruin the experience the first time.\n\nI was disappointed that it was another clone of a slender game, I honestly expected something like a polished version of Damned with clue searching and puzzle elements. I do like that tape recorders are randomly placed, so the game stays fresh. The developer missed out with only one monster model, that should have changed it to have a different monster (with different abilities) tailored to a scenario. There's few scenarios but that balances with options to allow you to change how the map is played like difficulty. You have a choice to choose characters each with strengths and weaknesses, that can change the play style, which once again I was hoping the monster would use your weakness against you.\n\nOverall, it's a cool coop game but I would preferred a little more content, it gets a pass from me because its five dollars, less with a fourpack.\n\n3/5 Add more puzzles like keys to find for locked areas, hidden chambers, etc. More coop elements like requiring people to work together to progress and more locations to play through (No manor/mansion scenario!? Really?) but the core gameplay and the rest of the game is fine.\n\nEDIT: NOW WITH LESS TYPOS!","May 22, 2014","true","0.8"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","0"

It's not really scare, the monster design is lacking severely, the sound design is not really frightening and the environment looks cheaply made, the character animation is choppy, but it's not even a AA title, so no reason to complain. It seems more like a Scooby Doo game than anything else. I will complain, however, that most achievements can only be unlocked by playing 4 player co-op. So if you're in an online game with one other person, you won't get the achievements.

It's fun if you're playing with friends and actually scary depending on the level.\n\nPlayed two games with 2 other friends. The first map we played was, I believe, the Chateau? The second was the Area51 type zone.\n\nAt first I was a little disappointed, we all were. It didn't seem _that_scary to us. Once we quit griping and actually ventured out to find the tapes it started to become a LOT more fun. By far, the most fun came from the closed up, almost labyrinthine, design of the second map. Panicking and losing each other, watching your friends die, having to continue on with their ghosts in tow, it was all so much fun.\n\nPROS:\nThe ambient sound is really creepy and lends itself perfectly to the atmosphere.\nThe graphics were decent and definitely worked in favor of the game's target atmosphere. Dark, creepy, and lots of fog so your rendering times are fast and everything runs smooth.\nThe built-in voice chat worked fine and helped out a lot. Usually we use Skype but we decided to let the game do it's thing.\nThe price. I mean come on, 6$? You can't beat that!\nBeing able to continue playing as a ghost after you die was fun. Helped the search.\n\nCONS: All very MINOR complaints.\nThere are NO subtitles. Nobody in my group could hear almost anything the people on the tape recorders said. It sounded like it might have been interesting too. :(\nNot being able to see the actual lit up areas from other people's flashlights. It would be nice to let your friends flashlights light up the hallway you're walking down too.\nCollision was sometimes irritating, getting stuck on some boxes while you're running away. Not much to be done about that, just try to steer while you panic?\nTension was slow to build depending the maps. I mean, yeah, a creepy forest is creepy and all, but being trapped down in a bunch of confined hallways is infinitely worse.\nFor first time players, picking a character is irritating because you don't know what the modifier symbols for them do exactly.

Despite that the description sounded interesting, so I figured I would give it a try.\n\nI wasn't sure how long it would play, so I started up a single player game. That was probably my first mistake. Unless you are really patient, the size of the map demands multiple players. Having multiple players also adds an element of strategy and teamwork to map exploration.\n\nThe first thing you do is choose a character which grants certain benefits and flaws. I didn't notice much difference between them, but then again I didn't really play enough to see.\n\nWhat I did see was a game consisting of walking VERY SLOWLY through the woods in the dark. Every so often my screen would start to get fuzzy and I would see a non-descript monster which I then proceeded to run away from. There were various landmarks to see such as buildings and statues and the part of the map I saw was bounded by water.\n\nThe goal of the game is to find tape recorders scattered across the map. Since your only clue to their location is the sound they make, you spend the game listening very carefully to your surroundings. That being said, the ambient noise and background is fairly well done.\n\nAn interesting touch was that after you finished you could see a map retracing your movements. You could see when you walked in circles over and over again. You could also see any places you panicked, died, or found recorders.\n\nPROS:\n+ Good Ambient Background Noise\n+ Character variation (even if its slight)\n+ Interesting Recap Map\n+ Can play with friends\n\nCONS:\n- The monster is boring and the game isn't scary\n- SLOW movement speed, even when running.\n- Flashlight is unusable when running. I don't know about you, but I would point it ahead not at my feet.\n- Not very fun to play solo\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game, the slow movement speed really killed it for me.

When your friends heard that it would be dark out, no one showed up but you. They can still come along mind you, but for now you're all alone with your flashlight in the darkness. You're never truly alone though. The one that has caused the grizzly murders is here with you, stalking you, watching you with its eyeless face.\n\nIts a nightmarish feeling to be stuck in a realm of darkness whether its a forest with a stream, a museum full of mummies and giant heads, an underground bunker with a submarine and so on. The only accessory on you is a flashlight with a narrow beam. Your feet feel covered in tar. It takes dozens of steps to move the slightest distance. You can run, but when you do, your flashlight sticks to the ground so its tough to gauge just how fast you're going or where you're going.\n\nThe one that watches you lights up the immediate area with its luminescent body so you can always see it. Every time it appears, its like metal scraping against metal to send a shiver up your weak and cowardly spine. Your only salvation is to look away and hope it leaves you in peace. If your friends were here, perhaps they could distract it, but no, you're here by yourself. Every moment you stare at its pale white figure you gain its attention more. Tension rise knowing that even if its far away in the distance, any second it can be right in your face. Look away! It wants your eyes.\n\nSearching in the darkness, you hear static to gain your interest. You must be close to a tape recorder. How these things are still playing, you'll never know. The sound grows in its intensity as you pace around a stone figure looking for it. Your flashlight shines to it no matter where you were pointing it originally. There it is, the first of many you'll need to find before you can call it a night.\n\nMore darkness, panting as you run and screams from being watched from closer distances. Can it see you or is it as blind as its eyeless face dictates? You turn around to see where it is, if its still following you, but its gone for now. If you had friends with you, perhaps it is after them. Your own skin saved for one of theirs.\n\nSound in the shadows kicks up in the darkness again, you approach a jade stone. There must be a tape recorder behind it or around it. The green glows in your flashlight's gaze. Static blurs your vision and makes you tremble as your sanity slips away. There must be something special about the jade stones. Have you seen them before in the distance? Seated on the ground, growing out of a museum wall? Are they mere stones or are they the hard shelled cocoons of a viscous blind monster with teeth and claws?\n\nEach night you go out, you feel the same, but you're a different person. You look different, but you'll never know outside of how you feel. Sometimes you feel brave, other times you feel swift or you have more stamina or less. Your name was Sarah last night, but tonight its Kurt. These bodies you inhabit look bright compared to the night's gloom you find yourself in. Its good to be a different person every night, because that's how you tell your friends apart, assuming they had ever shown up. All of it feels so irrelevant the differences between this body and the last are minimal even if something says you're special and unique. Perhaps its best that you're alone. Your friend Frank would probably mess it up with his blue hair and skeleton costume. You're all just bodies to the creature.\n\nUse wisdom and courage to make it through night after night, avoiding the pale white figure that illuminates the darkness. Tuck your fears away to make it through to the next area of your choosing. Perhaps some other night your friends will join you. No one ever comes with you. Its all up to you to endure the startling scares and the shrill shrieks.\n\nWhen its all over, you and your friends that never showed up are either victorious and can leave or dead at the hands of a ruthless beast that snatches you up one by one. As you cross over into what lies beyond, your steps are recounted and traced with lines across an empty sheet of paper along with how much time you survived. Was it a few seconds? Ten minutes? Thirty? You can survive indefinitely with large dark locales and only one demon hunting you.\n\nWell now that the ambiance is over, its time to kill it with a real review. White Noise is a first person experience that has you searching for tape recorders across six different maps. White Noise Online is indeed online and sold in four packs at a slight discount, because you'll never find anyone playing when you are. In fact some of us would rather play alone in general. It would still be interesting seeing other people and their quirky characters like Frank with his blue hair and skeleton outfit and the Invisible Man or woman running around. It would probably ruin feeling of terror.\n\nThe maps are all flat and pitch black with no light other than your flashlight  They each have their unique themes and while I feel there's a good amount of detail and the textures look fair to good, other games look better and have more detail. It feels like they put effort into adding details to make an area feel less bland, but it still feels lacking.\n\nThe characters each have flare and color to them that feels cheap yet still elaborate with a good amount of detail. Its the art style of the characters that works against the creepy vibe the game has. Some of the art choices outside the game are unfitting for a game like this.\n\nThe underground bunker feels hastily thrown together and bland even if it had jail cells, train cars and a submarine in it. There's no way to go in any of them but the cells. The rest of the map just feels so vacant and empty and that's the case for the majority of the maps. Perhaps that's because the movement speed is so slow that it can take an excessively long time just to walk to the nearest door.\n\nThere are a lot of frills White Noise Online has that other contemporaries are lacking. The post game recap is good. The game tells you how to play and what your objective is. It lets you select a map or have one chosen at random. There are even difficulty levels before you head into a game.\n\nThe music and sounds set a good creepy tone. The sounds add a lot of shock value when seeing the creature and having sound cues for the tape recorder ensure that you can find it when you're close enough. Again, it feels like a step above other games that make it feel like the developers care and have the ability to go the extra step.\n\nI'm on the fence with White Noise Online whether I should recommend it. Its a good game and above a lot of similar ones with the same objective. Its also cheap so that's always a push in the right direction. If you have friends with it that are willing to play, that's the only way you'll be able to play online.","October 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

I was pleased to find that this is a game that I can play without feeling sick, even when moving the flashlight around.\n\nI think for others who suffer from motion sickness, this is a game that you can play, without it disturbing you. Fingers crossed!\n\n♥ It reminds me of Obscure.\n\nObscure is a game that I adore, absolutely, absolutely adore. When I first saw White Noise Online in the store and noted how the characters looked, I was excited.\n\nThough the game isn't quite on the level of Obscure, it does have flavors of it through the characters, scenery, and the atomsphere of the game.\n\n♥ It isn't very scary.\n\nThis can be a plus or a minus depending on how you look at it. If you're looking for a scary game to play with your friends then I'd browse on. If you're looking for a one time play or a game to pass the time with friends, White Noise Online is perfect.\n\n✘ The replay interest is...eeep.\n\nI think it depends on who you're playing with however when I played with my friends, we were bored after the first couple rounds. Though you can select different maps to play, there isn't much variety with the gameplay itself.\n\n✘ Finding partners can be difficult.\n\nI was lucky and purchased the game in a bundle so I was able to share the keys with others. This way I established a group of people that I could play it with - if you're looking for someone to play it with, good luck. I don't think there are many people who do.\n\n✘ I'm terrified of many things.\n\nThe dark. Moths. Dolls. However the monster in this game? I screamed when he popped up behind me yet when I realized how the monster looked...I started laughing. It really isn't scary looking - looking more like someone's first Blender 3D project than anything else.\n\nOverall I wish there was a button for neither yes or no because I'm on the fence about White Noise Online... I went with the Yes rating because the first round was a lot of fun and I appreciate that.","May 28","true","1.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I've played SCP series and didn't find them "chilly". I've played Elyusis, Anna and some other titles. Finally I've completed Doorways and it was atmosperic and nice, not scary. But this game is a real dark ambient atmoshperic horror. Yeah, it has some jumpscares in it's core mechanics. But they are not as thrilling as the surrounding. (I've walked into my first death just because it didn't look dangerous or frightening). Took a walk in some kind of military basement, I guess. Twice. It feels like your nightmare where you are trying to run at full speed but you move in slo-mo. Hat off to the sound designer. Ambient music and sounds  are simply 10/10.

So if you just turn arround, dont look at it (well looking at it is not worth at all ... its not scary, its not beautyful ... it is not interesting in any kind) and walk in another direction ... nothing happens. Ok, the monster will get you ... cause your light will run out, I said it already. Very funny.\nThe only thing I liked on this game was the sound and that it has trading cards, but if its not on sale (it was when I bought it) even the 5 bucks of its normal price are much too much, you get much more game from other indie Developers for that money.\nSo buy it if you want a boring, simple game, buy it if you like trading cards ... or if you are a collector.\nEverybody else will for sure find better slendertype games in that genre.

This game is a very basic horror game. You have your flashlight, You can run, and a giant monster chases you around sometimes popping up right in front of you. Also each character has their own traits like one can get scared more without dying or a longer duration for his/her flashlight or can just walk faster but some also have minus some of these things like have a better flashlight but could be very slow. you can adjust your sensitivity to how ever you feel is best (highest to look away from the thing faster). This game also comes with different difficulties ranging from Easy to Nightmare. As you scavenge the map for 8 Recorders kind of like the 8 pages in slender a story begins to unfold.

At the time, it was the best dollar I had ever spent on a digital game because this game is fun . . . if you have friends . . . and if you need to kill small amounts of time. The gameplay is very simple as you walk around searching for 8 tapes while avoiding eye contact with a monster and strange green statues., which is something I actuallly appreciate about WNO.\n\nThe visuals and music are also simple. That's fine. It makes it easier to see/hear the tapes you need to collect and the monster you need to avoid.\n\nIt's compared to Slender, and rightfully so. That's also fine. I liked Slender well enough.\n\nI'd definitely recommend playing with friends and not taking this game too seriously.\n\nHowever, the asking price is much higher than on Xbox. If, over time, new content is added beyond new maps and characters, then the price may be fair.\n\nBut, I still bought it and installed it on my Steambox. I had good memories playing it on my Xbox 360 with friends, and want it available on Steam. I will encourage my friends to buy it so I can play with them.\n\nIf you play alone, either wait for a steep discount or go all-in and buy the 4-pack to take advantage of what makes this game enjoyable - simple, stupid fun with friends.\n\nI'll recommend buying it as a small co-op game.","May 27, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, the only thing scary about this game is how unbelievably not fun it is. I'm actually a little alarmed by the all the good reviews.\n\nThe game goes something like this: you pick a character, you choose a map, and then you walk around in wide open, labyrinthine areas trying to find abnormally large recorders. Seriously, where are they putting all those recorders that are the size of backpacks? A really poorly designed monster starts getting irritable that you're not finding its recorders fast enough and starts stalking you once it thinks you're not putting in enough effort. The basic concept in how the monster works is similarish to Slender or even Amnesia, but in a bad way. If you look at it, you go insane and die; if you don't look at it then it will just follow you around and decide to kill you sooner or later. And when I say kill you, it actually just pops up in front of you and shakes its head (probably out of disappointment).\n\nThe gameplay is not fun, there's no real cooperative actions to speak of, the maps are poorly designed and sparsely populated, and indie PC horror games really need to get over the whole "find random objects attached to random trees" euphoria it seems to be stuck on. Even the description of the game is confused: "Once the thrilling game session is over, have a laugh while seeing how you kept walking in circles!" Oh, we laughed, but not at how "thrilling" our game session was.","August 31, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The problem is that the levels are too big with not many landmarks, so you're frequently accidentally backtracking because you don't know where to go.

Did I mention that you're doing this at night? Who goes out to search for a serial murderer at night? Seriously!\n\nSo you're given a flashlight to illuminate your way while stumbling around in the dark. If your game is based around a light mechanic, I expect it to be decently implemented. But the shadows cast by objects aren't really cast on anything; they don't even appear to be volumetric. I mean, I get that this is an indie game that was originally released on the peasant box, and some affordances need to be made: but this is the main mechanic in the entire game!\n\nWhich brings us to the maps: the darkness limits your view (which was probably the inteded effect), but the maps themselves consist of the same objects copypastad over and over again, ensuring that you'll get lost, and be unable to form a mental map of where you are and where you came from.

I'd expected something that felt thrown together or more like a mod and ended up getting a fairly entertaining game that's true strength is its simplicity. Playing alone would be drab, I imagine, but having a twitchy/nervous friend to play it with is great.\n\nMy only real gripe is a lack of ability to mark where I've been. As a firefighter I'm accustomed to having a piece of chalk on me to indicate rooms I've cleared, would love to see a feature like that make it into this title. Feel like investigators would have something similar at their disposal.\n\nThe Good:\nA few solid jump-scares, and I'm really not easy to startle.\nSimple drop-in gameplay that doesn't need a great deal of introduction or explanation to enjoy.\nLarge maps designed in a manner which can really get one lost and add to the atmosphere.\nMonster's tactics, though simple, are effective enough to split up groups and cause disorder. Was challenging to keep ahead of it.\n\nThe Bad:\nWalk speed is painfully slow.\nRun speed is what most games would call their default walking pace and you can only run about four or five seconds before depleting your stamina.\nNo way to leave bread crumbs for yourself, mark places you've already been.","November 6, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Slender in general is just a luck simulator with default everything while this game makes it more strategy with all the characters and their abilities.

Animation quality is poor. Texture quality is poor, with broken textures flickering all over the terrain. Collision detection is dreadful. Lighting, the most important component of this genre of horror, is quite awful; and the online part of White Noise Online, a pretty important component, for all intents and purposes, is dead. About the only positive that I can come up with for this title is that the sound design is fantastic and really creates a great atmosphere, an atmosphere that the rest of the game fails to pay off in any meaningful way.\n\nHere is my full in-depth review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu0KULDBU5Q&list=PLrP♥♥♥♥NvQ66-JAuKXgWLiVKaNRGUqXFX&index=7\n","February 8","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyone who likes the Slender clones I think you should give this a try. But unless you want to spend some extra money on extra copies for your friends to play with you, you will not be playing online as no one goes online! I tried loading up online mode, no one joined. I look at the server browser and it said no games are available. So if you want to play this online with random people, go on the Xbox 360 version of the game.
