The back story is really engaging and the way you pilot the mechs is an interesting twist.  Great action to be had and needless to say, love the Iconic Manchester building dominating the games opening.\n\nCan’t wait for more!","June 2","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Seriously one of the finest outputs in early acces. Graphics are great, pacing is nice and it runs like a charm. Iam running it on my 2013 gaming laptop I7 processor, 6 gb ram and GT 630m graphic cards, really below min specs and it goes at good 30 fps (im not a purist, you see, im fine with 30fps) at 1600 x 900 res with medium settings. I assume that if you run it with the min specs you easily gonna get it work at 60 fps on medium settings. Only one thing i dont understand: why there are only 3 comments from customers? Men!!! Mech action on smooth UE4 graphics on a postapocalyptic Manchester!!!! At the moment this game is a criminally underrated gem. Do yourself a favor and buy it now. The only caution is to force youyrself to take care of your real world relationships ant maintain a respectable sex frequency with youyr girlfriend. This is more adictive than cigarretes and Mc Donalds burgers : )","June 2","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Being a resident of Manchester myself I can say they nailed what a futuristic version of our great city might look like. And the sound of the wood Pidgeon whilst walking around the city was a nice touch.\n\nI also like the idea of DOOM style fatalities/glory kills on your enemy’s, these are not that well animated at this point but I am sure in future these will look awesome and will feel great to execute.\n\nThe only gripe I had with the game is the voice acting, the main guy who is guiding you through the game was simply a bore to listen to, and the sergeant wasn't much better, it felt like they were literally reading the lines as they were saying them, they needed a bit more enthusiasm for me, but I am sure these lines will be re-recorded for the final release.\n\nAlso the idea of customizable mechs with interchangeable augments and weapons, and the way they feel in game, makes me think this would make a fantastic multiplayer game. Big maps, multiple objective games, interchangeable weapons and fast shooting gameplay... Oh yes :)\n\nAll in all the game look pretty good so far, considering how quickly the team has grown and the fact that an indie dev is creating this AAA style game is amazing! HUGE credit to all the guys at pixel bomb! I cant wait to see more in the future.","June 4","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Know what their plans are...\n\nThe standout feature of BFB is the executions.  Run up to an enemy and you can perform an execution, which there are several different styles.  Executions on humans seem to be the most polished while executions on animals can be performed they are broken.  The executions are gory and generally end up with the victim being torn from their limbs, showing their spines and other internals dangling out\n\nCombat is not very inspiring, you are a giant mech trying to shoot tiny, fast moving, targets where pin point accuracy is required to hit your targets.  If this doesn't change then be prepared for a mediocre experience.  Having said that it's something that can be easily fixed by the dev's.  One option would be allow the projecticles to gravitate towards enemies (not homing missiles) allowing near misses to become hits, therefore slightly more forgiving on current pin point accuracy.\n\nThe first party of the game has you trundling around for around an hour or so through empty streets and building, before adding some K9's to kill, eventualy adding more intelligent, human, foe's.  All of which is interspersed by some puzzle mechanics that need to be overcome to continue on your journey.\n\nA hacking mechanic is in game, which all you have to do is hold a key down to perform the hack.  Hack a terminal and you get a little mono rail journey towards a camera you can view and then hack another camera  until you can hack a switch that opens a door.  Very similar to Watch Dogs, though it needs more polish and copying Watch Dogs mechanic and style for hacking would be no bad thing.\n\nLevel designs are OK, though you will find yourself inside narrow buildings and outside in streets being lead down a corridor, with only one way to go.  Outside there is plenty colours as the Manchester streets are over grown with fooliage, while the inside of buildings are mostly barren and empty.  Though there is a nice night club building you visit briefly.\n\nIt took me around 90 minutes to complete what is currently available, the total play time for Episode One is guestimated to be 3hours.\n\nIf the Dev's are serious about their game then I would expect EA development time to continue towards the 12 month time to apply the polish needed to this game.\n\nEarly Access games are difficult to review.  Line up 10 EA games together and their current feature set and level of polish will differ significantly.  If you don't like to play games which contain bugs and expect all features to be present then I recommend you never buy an EA game.  On the flip side, if you like what you see and want to support the developers then go for it.","June 5","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
