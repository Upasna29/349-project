It's powerful when applied correctly, so often being impossible to emulate in real life. You can't run like Sonic, your car doesn't go as fast as Captain Falcon's - and I'd be very surprised if you can move like the hero of 10 Second Ninja.He's a double jumping, sword slashing, shuriken throwing robot destruction machine. Madly dashing through short platforming puzzles, his ultimate goal is always the same: destroy the nazi robots as fast as possible. Half the game is sequencing and strategy, determining the most efficient uses of those precious second jumps and limited throwing stars.At first a level will seem straight forward - a combination of runs and leaps that take out everything in what you'll assume is a respectable time.Things can be confusing at first, for different reasons - but then you notice the time savers. The opportunities to take out two enemies with one move, skip jumps or maintain momentum. In later levels the addition of complications like falling rocks and portals change the equation. The slow consideration to start a level is a nice counter-point to the split-split-second reaction times needed to perform the plans you come up with.That's the other half. Thumb-mutilating skills coupled with reset after reset to shave milliseconds off times in pursuit of those required to unlock levels or climb the bragging rights only online leaderboard. The game controls wonderfully and the simplistic art uses precise frame stages to broadcast changes in status, vital for instant understanding. While it won't be for everyone, Ninja does exactly what it set out to, with style and humour to boot.","January 22, 2015","true","112.1"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","0"

Just some keywords to describe 10 Second Ninja. You have 10 seconds to clear a level by defeating all of the enemies. You start with some simple platforms, but a few levels later the game will introduce something new. Falling pillars and portals to name a few. It requires speed, skill and a clear head. I think I would describe the game as a puzzle platformer, even if it's more action focused than you would think. There are 5 worlds to complete, and each world has about 8 levels I think. But I think it took me less than an hour to complete all 5 worlds (ok, ok, I didn't clear every level with 3 stars) so it's pretty damn short. But man, is it good. Normally I'd say that if you enjoy a game the price doesn't really matter. But it's hard to justify the price for this game just because it's so freaking short.\nSo, let it be for now and grab it when it's on sale, or at least costs €5 or less.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","March 22, 2014","true","1.3"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartview/recommended/271670/","heartview","Heartview","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartview/","206 products in account","I have a few things to say about the game so I'll do a Pros vs Cons list first.\n\nPros\nFast paced\nPretty tight controls\nEasy to pick up, difficult to master\nCHALLENGING\nSimple (read effective) graphics\nGood sound design\n\nCons\nShort\nA bit pricey (related directly to above con)\nMaybe lacking a few features\n\nNow I consider myself to be a veteran when it comes to platforming games like this. I have completed n, Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy, I wanna Be The Guy/Boshy all in their entirety, as well as a slew of other action platformer games. And I easily consider 10 Second Ninja to be up there as one of my favorites. It's a game with a realtively simple concept: Kill all robots on the map using either a close range sword or long range shuriken projectiles, all without dieing in as little time as possible. Easy enough to understand, but the level the game is played at makes it a deceptively difficult. The timing for a lot of the levels requires near perfect jumps and accuracy to get 3 star ratings on, and posting higher leaderboard scores requires near pixel perfect accuracy and timing. There is a real challenge here hidden behind the easy to understand controls and mechanics. If you enjoy a good challenge in your platformers, don't skip this game. While not masochistic by any means, any self-respecting action platformer fan needs this game under their belt.\n\nNow the controls for this game are also pretty good, with great response time. My only gripe with some of the controls comes from slight issues like corner bumping. Landing too far off the edge on the corner will not let you stand on the ledge, however a second mid-air jump can still be performed after falling off even if both jumps were used prior to landing, meaning the game registers that you have hit the ground already. In a game where pixel perfect accuracy comes into play, this might get a tad annoying on some levels, though it is a bit difficult to notice. It can also be difficult to gauge throwing shurikens along the ground as the hitbox for it is a bit strange. This is really a non issue, but sometimes a shuriken will hit the wall at a corner, and other times it will slide across the ground as you wanted it to. I say it is a non issue because honestly, it comes down to how precise you are when throwing it in the first place, so it becomes more of an issue of when you throw it rather than the game registering the hitbox badly. So in reality, its just a small visual gripe rather than an actual game issue. Otherwise, the controls are incredibly responsive and tight. A real pleasure to play as the game feels like its actually listening to what you tell it to do.\n\nThe sound design, while not much to note, is effective and aestheticly pleasing. No over the top speaker destroying sound bytes, just simple, effective sound design. Love it.\n\nNow I listed 3 cons, however this boils down to really just one, and perhaps more of a reccomendation for future development. My only real con with this game is the current $10 price tag, for a pretty short game that can be completed in one sitting. No end game content, no unlockables, which means the only thing keeping you playing the game after beating the final level is getting better personal times, and ranking up on leaderboards. And with the few levels provided, should be quite a bit of replayability, though I would still say the game lacks girth. However, this issue would be remedied entirely by a user level repository, and obviously the ability to make your own levels. Now do I think the price tag is too steep? Not at all. I have payed more for less before, and given how awesome this game is, it is well worth it. More of a passing thought rather than a real issue to be fair.\n\nAs for any lacking features, it really boils down to adding in a level builder for users (Steam workshop integration would be awesome, a la Battleblock Theatre) and possibly adding in individual level leaderboards, though I could see how that would just be more confusing given that times come down to differences in 100th of a second resulting in long lists of the exact same time on down the leaderboard.\n\nSo in conclusion to my lengthy review of a rather short and simple game, I would absolutely reccomend the game to anyone, completley ignoring any small cons I might have found. Action platformer fans, if you don't already have it, get it. The games length and price is no excuse to not take part in the robo-nazi slaughterfest by the hands of a twitchy ninja. You are the only hope little man, save us from those Evil mecha-nazis.

It might sound like a gimmick, but levels are designed in such a way as to be almost puzzle like in execution, requiring not only brute reflexes but also an understanding of how to best make use of your limited repertoire to shave off every tenth of a second you can manage.\n\nNaturally, this causes the game to move at a ridiculous pace, but unlike a lot of hyper challenging platformers 10 Second Ninja avoided ever becoming overwhelming. Its basic mechanics give you just enough leeway to experiment within levels so as to keep them from feeling too linear or restricting their design, while being entirely understandable and intuitive to execute, and the necessarily small size of each level keeps the experience easily digestible but not to the detriment of a satisfying challenge. 10 Second Ninja isn't an easy game, but it always feels surmountable, if only you could find the perfect strategy or go a little faster.\n\nAnd then an hour later you're through, perhaps having missed a few perfect level ratings but for the most part seeing what the game has to offer. And surprisingly I was entirely OK with that. 10 Second Ninja for as short as it is makes every moment engaging, each level offering its own twist on mechanics that never change because they don't need to, and finding time for some humorous dialogue in between smashing up Robot Hitler's disembodied head. There's just something inherently entertaining here, and it all comes together into a tightly condensed package that understands it doesn't need to be hundreds of hours long. It just needs to be fun.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/recommended/271670/","leonresevil2","LeonRes [OC]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leonresevil2/","582 products in account","May 20, 2015\nIf you aren't a speedrunner, I wouldn't consider 10 Second Ninja. I decided to buckle down and really work at the game after a frustrating introduction, and quickly completed it with some effort. The full content is around 4 minutes long, with later levels only adding portals and enemies that take two hits to kill. The only appeal of the game is finding routes to optimize times, but other games do so much more in the genre.\n\nThe game is built on Game Maker, I only knew this after the 2nd cutscene gave up a Game Maker error report and crashed the game when an image couldn't be found. The program seems to take process priority along with nearly 500MB of RAM, slowing the Desktop and all other activities if you want to Alt-Tab. FPS is good, and I assume the high priority is to make sure the clock is accurate.\n\nControls are simple but inconsistent, not really fitting for a precision platformer. The sword hitbox can be gigantic at times, even allowing some kills through walls. Normal ground behaves more like Ice, while Ice really didn't give me much issue. Sometimes the ninja would run with no buttons pressed after restarting, while other times it would ignore my inputs (mostly in the Hard mode 100% run, wasting precious time). The 10-second max means most levels are very limited, with only 4 of the 40 levels spanning beyond the screen. I'm kinda shocked a ninja in a platforming game can't wall-jump, while a famous cube of meat puts this ninja to shame.\n\nThe game requires Stars to progress in the game, so expect to repeat and perfect levels from the start. Beginners will get trapped in the first world until they can improve times for Stars. At least the community seems friendly, with some helpful strategy videos to complete the game. I don't know if the developer cleans time records, but there's a cheater with a 100% time under 5 seconds that needs wiped. At least the music in the Bonus area was really good.\n\nOverall, the game is too one-dimensional. Super Meat Boy, Stealth Bast Deluxe, and other platformers allow speedrunning without limiting level design and cutting mechanics. 40 short levels, no variety in traps or enemies, and no included level editor means content is slim. It's bundle fodder, which is where I got it, and the store price is insane. There's nothing really unique here. If you're a speedrunner that has exhausted every other game, you could still find other games with more content. The cutscenes may be longer than the gameplay, but they try too hard to be memetic and get tweets. A hashtag in a cutscene, yuck. Considering all the levels can be reasonably completed in 240 seconds, you must see the cost-per-hour here is awful. It had potential, but the title restricted the gameplay far too much.","January 8, 2015","false","5.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","3"

In this fast-paced platformer, your aim is to clear every single level in less than ten seconds - that is, kill every robot on the screen, using your weaponry and triggering environmental hazards. Aim for the lowest possible time to earn a three-star rating!\n\nThe concept is really nice, and the par times are very tightly balanced. Finding the optimal route for each level will require meticulous planning, and the execution leaves no room for error. It is incredibly satisfying when you nail your inputs perfectly and maximize a route's potential, and deeply unnerving when even then, you're still half a second too slow; reconsider what seems obvious, think outside the box and, most of all, keep optimizing your inputs. The original core concept, the precise controls and meticulously balanced level design are the game's main strenghts.\n\nNow for the cons. The visuals and cutscenes are entirely forgettable, which can be excused in a low-budget indie game such as this. The soundtrack, albeit repetitive, serves its purpose but isn't particularly memorable either. My main criticism would be that the game is really short, and perhaps not quite as "hardcore" as it may appear at first. I was a little disappointed to hit the ending credits after only a few hours (plus maybe an extra half hour on the bonus world), with all the three-star ratings earned and without hitting any major roadblocks.\n\nI would have loved more content, and I felt that certain ideas in the level design could have been further developped (portals, falling/crumbling blocks, etc). As it is, I can't say that the game has exploited its potential to the fullest; nevertheless, it remains a solid puzzle platformer and one of the most execution-intensive games I have played in a while, with relatively fair content for its price.

The controls are extremely fluent, and the game takes about 10 seconds to pick up and play, and perhaps 10 minutes to get the hang of it. It combines puzzle with speedrunning in the most fundamental kind of way. The fact that each level is about 5 seconds long and restarting is instant means it's not frustrating or off-putting. This is perhaps its greatest strength - that by having extremely short levels, the execution becomes much more important. Timing jumps and movement perfectly to shave off milliseconds is something you'll be doing a lot right from the beggining - and this is, in essense, what speedrunning is all about. Games with longer levels and deeper mechanics are so complex that most players never really reach the point of searching for an extra few milliseconds to hit the target time because most players don't have the time to practice perfecting their run of a level longer than a minute - and thus, they lose out on the excitement of time trials. This game is extremely accessible and fun to play, and clearly demonstrates the appeal of speedrunning to any non-gamer. Would highly recommend for perfectionists. Also, the ahcievements are awesome.","October 8, 2014","true","16.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At first glance (as well as when you play it) the concept seems more geared to be a mobile game than a PC game. However, the pacing is more fitting of a PC/console game. Completing each level in 10 seconds or less is not hard at all, even if you aren't used to fast paced games. With practice, avoiding spikes and falling objects becomes easy. The real challenge is getting 3 stars on every level, which can take some time.\n\nIf you are considering buying it, ask yourself this: "Am I going to try to 100% it?" If the answer is no, you aren't going to get much out of the game. Playing through each level only once won't take much time, and is especially not worth $9.99 in that regard. If you are a completionist (or are for just this game), definitely pick up the game, but still at a discounted price. I only heard about it and bought it because I crafted a 90% off coupon for it (s***, it was 99 cents!). At that price, it was definitely worth it.\n\nOf course, getting 3 stars on every level is often brutally difficult, and at times frustrating. You will have to time your jumps and attacks perfectly , which will take loads of trial and error (and error and error and error). This is a turn-off for a lot of people, but a selling point for others. It is entirely dependent on whether you enjoy fast-paced games or not. Completing each level with 3 stars left me saying "Damn, I can't believe I just did that, let's do the bonus levels!" and not "Wow, I just wasted 5.8 hours on that?".\n\nIn the end, the question I ask myself is "Did I have fun?". Yes. A lot of it. There were some levels that were just frustrating (I'm looking at you Deathcube Level 1), but most of them were a blast to complete. Definitely pick it up when it is discounted if you enjoy fast-paced games or are looking for something new to try.","November 20, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good move speed and jump height, sword attack has nice range, shruikens are decently fast, double jump really helps out, and each area has a few gimmicks of its own to keep things fresh.\n\nThe main problem is that, well, the game is super short. Let's put it in perspective; "hard mode" has  you play through the entire game in under four minutes. So yeah... not a massive amount of content in all, especially for $10. And that's, really, the sticking point for me. I quite enjoyed my time with this game, it was a ton of fun. This kind of thing is right up my alley. But for the asking price, combined with the presentation equivalent to a flash game, I would *not* recommend this game at its full price. Half off, maybe. 66% off is what I got it for and even that feels a bit too high for me, but considering that I did enjoy most every moment I spent with the game I suppose I can't complain too much. It's designed well, the 3 star times are fairly realistic when you figure out the expected route, and the fact that everything is so quick helps too since you're never losing more than a few seconds of progress with every failure (or a few minutes in hard mode, but that's usually more than one failure to fail the target time...)\n\nSo yeah, if you want a good fast-paced platformer with an emphasis on speedrunning, and you don't care about the price, pick it up for sure. If money is a factor, wait for a sale. I do enjoy this game a lot, so it's a bit disappointing that it's as short as it is, really.","January 3, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

To start off with, the game is VERY challenging but fun and rewarding if you succeed. This is not your average game that getting 3 stars is an easy walk in the park until later levels. NO this game hits you with toughness level 1. Every level must be compeleted under 10 seconds. Not to mention, the boss level requires you to have a certain amount of stars to be able to do it... and you cant do it with only 1 star per level. That means a lot of rage and a lot or restarts in under 5 seconds. The requirements for even just 2 stars is VERY challenging and you will have to start getting used to the game and develop a strategy to just get 2 stars. Actually getting 1 star is sometimes even hard. Now imagine 3 stars... When they say "You must be perfect, you must be fast" they 100% mean it.

Killing robohitlers robots and jumping over spikes are prominent to this platformer.. A simple well put together game with mild humour again not for everyone.

It's more of an initiation to speedrunning than a game tailored for experienced speedrunners, but it's probably enjoyable to both sides!\n\nEach level has a 10 second limit, taking some of Super Meat Boy's standards to the extreme, with quick restarts and keeping the player in the action at all times.\n\nI've 100% the game a bit after 4 hours, which includes beating the game in 4 minutes.\n\nThe level themselves are pretty easy to beat, but getting the 3 stars (for time) can be infuriating! In a good way, though. Missing the mark for 0.02 seconds is tough, but finally getting the 3 stars is really rewarding as well!\n\nThe boss fights were rather uninspired, but it's easy to overlook that.\n\nThere are several worlds, each introducing a small mechanic and making use of it.\n\n\nIt might be a bit price-y for its content, but the game itself is pretty good! The short length fits nicely, and it's a nice game to start up once in a while to make a quick <5 minutes speedrun. I like it.\n\nThe humour in the game was a bit of a flop to me, but hey... the level design was nice and the game felt responsive most of the time.\n\nIf you can get it cheap and the idea of speedrunning attracts you, give it a go!

You will be hopping around slashing at Nazi robots and a big robot Hitler, while laughing at the weird cutscenes.\n\nControls: They are pretty simplistic. Arrow Keys to move around and you can slash with you sword/throw ninja stars with X and Z. The game is really responsive to the control input, which is great. I played a bit on the steam controller and its just as good. I used the analog stick instead of arrow keys, with X and B as the sword and ninja stars, and the A as jump.\n\nGraphics: It's not too great, but that isn't the purpose. The purpose is suppose to similar to the internet flash games. Simplistic and easy on the computer.\n\nMusic: Not really that prominent. It's not really that bad but it's not really that good either.\n\nOverall: 10 Seconds Ninja is a great game, and I would recommend the game to anybody, but I don't think that it is worth the full price and wouldn't be a bad buy on a sale. You don't need godlike reflexes, but the game instead relys on you being able to break through the puzzles and see which is the best route to beat the level and then practice it to perfection.","February 4","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A platformer that will remind you of "Super Meat Boy". All levels are single-screen, each of which are completed in 10 seconds or less. Jump, double jump, slash and throw shurikens. Complete levels quicker for more stars. More stars will unlock more levels.\n\nGood or bad? Bad. My major grief with this game is that it seems to run different depending on hardware (having tried on three different rigs, unpredictable on older hardware, running good (but slow) for a few minutes then running bad (garbage collection perhaps?) for a few minutes). I set all my personal high scores on my medium rig and was then completely unable to beat any of them on my new rig. To the point where I suspected I must have gotten drunk or that the game actually runs too fast on newer hardware. (This bold claim needs confirmations of course.)\n\nIt is (no matter what Total Biscuit says) a poorly made game and frustratingly hard. Maybe some masochists will enjoy it but the game-sessions are too short and choppy to make the experience enjoyable.\n\nAchievements are falling like rain during the first hours of game play, but I suspect the later ones can be very tough.\n\nDon't buy into this unless heavily discounted.","January 28, 2015","false","2.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

So, I have to take points off for that. Other than that, I don't have a whole lot to gripe about. The game does what they want it to do, and it's pretty fun if you're good at this sort of thing. Unfortunately, I'm not that great at...this...sort of thing.\n\nRevisiting...\n\nI decided to revisit this after taking a break from it for, uh, forever. If you can't tell, I got a little bit frustrated with trying to play to a ridiculous standard of speed. I don't know what I expected, given the fact that the title does mention 10 seconds, which is exactly how much time you have to do anything before you just fail miserably. However, I can't fathom why this has such high markings from other people.\n\nIt works!\n\nYes, it does work. Immediately, this puts it in a class of its own amongst other similarly-rated Steam games that flat out don't work at all. If the difficulty setting weren't on, "Screw you and your ability to enjoy yourself!" I might have played it more. It accomplishes making you think quickly to get all the kills you need, but falls short of being entirely fun due to this.\n\nGraphics and music blahblahblah blah\n\nBoth are good and they do what they accomplish. The pseudo-oriental theme music and robot nazi ideas are cute, but it wears thin after about 30 seconds, which is exactly how long it will take you to play through 5 levels of the game. Seriously, once you get through 3 you run out of things to expect from it - so you really only need about a half hour of playtime to get everything out of it that you need.\n\nA hesitant recommendation\n\nLook, the game says what it is, and it works well at doing it. The graphics are cute, there's robot zombies, there's ninjas, you can figure it out. This isn't exactly a game that many people will put hours upon hours upon hours of gameplay into unless they have some sort of spectrum disorder. I will, however, give it a 7/10 for doing EXACTLY what it wants to do, and doing it as hard as it possibly can until any respective player wants to cap themselves in the eyeball.","January 4","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Very easy to pick up and yet this game is extremely challenging if you are attempting to gain three stars on every level.\n\nThe game is divided up into worlds, each with several standard levels that lead up to a 'world boss' fight which must be unlocked by achieving enough stars on the previous levels. Every level, including boss fights, must be completed in under ten seconds, hence the name.\n\nThis isn't normally too taxing - the difficulty comes when attempting to either gain stars or to achieve a better time in order to get into the top 50 leaderboards.\n\nThe comedy in the cutscenes is fantastic - the premise being that 'Robot Hitler' and a legion of baddies are planning world domination and one little ninja is all that stands in his way.\n\nEasy to pick up and put down. An extremely fun distraction. Great as a tool for reaction speed training, too.\n\nHighly recommended.","October 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and the story is somewhat amusing. I would say that if you are really into speedrunning then you may enjoy this more than the average gamer. However, the game lags severly at seemingly random times (NOTE: I am playing on a brand new computer that plays modern 3D games, so I know it's a problem with the game and not my PC). This throws off your timing after you have planned a good route and the game stalls halfway through your run. I also experienced crashing in some of the cut-scenes due to some programming issues. If you look in the game forums - I'm not the only one experiencing these issues.\n\nSummary: Fun game, when it works. The random lag makes it often unplayable. Skip the cut-scenes to avoid game crashing.","October 28, 2015","false","4.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game doesn't recognise controllers on many PCs. The devs are aware of this and are working on a fix, but to release a game based on twitch reflexes like this and have the controller support that bugged is a complete mistake on their part.\n\n2. The game eats memory like I eat Chinese food at a buffet. Why is a game that looks like a Flash game from 2005 using 400MB of RAM? Why does it stutter and lag on my computer? My computer can run Super Meatboy just fine, but this game has to be dropped to the lowest resolution in windowed mode to run smoothly. On better computers, this is probably not an issue, but a game like this should be able to run well on a computer from 4 years ago - heck, it should be able to run well on a computer from 10 years ago.\n\n3. This game is not worth 7.99€. The amount of levels is staggeringly low. I've played the game for 2 hours and am almost at 100% on all the levels except the locked bonus stage. Either the devs thought people would struggle more to get through stages that it would take longer, or they honestly thought the game has enough content to justify 7.99€. It does not.\n\nI get that the devs are independant, probably don't have a lot of money, and are trying to make some money to work on bigger projects, I totally understand and respect that, but as a consumer, 7.99€ is not a price I would pay for a game this short with so many problems. The devs say they're trying to fix things, and if the issues go away I will gladly change the review to positive (even despite the shortness), but until then, I'd have to advise people to not buy this game.","March 22, 2014","false","2.9"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

A few youtube videos showed gameplay that looked kind of fun, but the actual game itself is kind of buggy and poorly designed. I heard someone compare it to Super Meatboy, and I can only assume they meant the newgrounds flash version rather than the much more polished game available on Steam.\n\nAlso, a few times, it felt like my route was sufficient to get three stars, and it eventually did, but it fell short of a tenth of a second the first time. It's a very tight game with somewhat unforgiving controls. For example, I swear I should be able to jump at point A but no, I need to wait a twentieth of a second before jumping.\n\nIn short, it tries to be a Super Meatboy-esque game, but Super Meatboy was very polished, while as this feels more like something some guy just made in Game Maker. It COULD be a Super Meatboy level game, conceptually, but it just lacks that same level of polish.","June 2, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

It's that damned auto-save I think, too many records too quick: crash.\n\nEDIT 2:\nThrice, now, the game has become irrevocably laggy. There really is no need to auto-save after every new record; the game calls for so much speed and dexterity, we (at least I) are mashing buttons (skillfully) with the quickness, even in the menus. Auto-save IS a good thing, of course, but after every record…? *Shake my head* it should be set to where it auto-saves only after you leave that level or something.\n\nTo be sure, 10 Second Ninja is a great game. Other than that (damn-near) game-breaking lag, My only complaints are:\n---I sometimes disagree with the jumping, i.e. the, er, "hit-box" of the Ninja is way bigger than it should be; when trying to jump between a narrow crevice, Ninja bumps his head far too often when it doesn't look like he should.\n---The direction in which you throw your Shurikens can be finnicky and from whence you throw the Shurikens is weird whilst double-jumping; I can't tell where exactly from within that little ball of Ninja the throwing-star issues from (many failed assassinations because the shuriken flew into the side of the cliff I was jumping over).\n\nOf course, these complaints are not legitimate because the game is designed very tightly; those two issues only add to the challenge; every millisecond counts.","January 8, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lose plot revolves around a robot Hitler and a ninja having to destroy robots with a big sword. It’s not likely to win best screenplay but then sometimes you just want to jump around and hit things.\n\nA platform game mixed with a heavy puzzle element, the main gameplay gimmick is that you only have ten second with which to complete each stage. The timer only starts after you make your first move which means you can spend some time surveying the single screen style levels in an attempt to work out the best route to victory.\n\nYour Ninja has a couple of skills to help along the way. You can use three shurikens in each level and also double jump. You’ll need to work out the best enemies to hit with throwing stars in advance as it can be the difference between victory and defeat if you use them in the wrong place. Shurikens can also be used to set off icicle falls, which in turn can crush robots for you.\n\nYou’ll need to complete levels as quickly as possible as well as you're awarded between one to three stars upon completion. You’ll start out completely mystified as to how you get the two or three star ratings but as you progress it all becomes clearer. Getting three stars on levels does require almost Jedi like reflexes though.\n\nThe levels themselves are a mixture of floating platforms, spikes and collapsing stones. More obstacles and enemies are added as the game progresses and you also have to contend with some good old fashioned ice stages as well. Everything is there for a reason and that reason is for you to plan your assault and deal with the robots as quickly as possible.\n\nThe star system does create a problem however, as you are required to collect a certain amount before taking on each areas boss. In our view the requirement is set a touch too high and we can see players hitting a complete dead end at times. In a game all about speed and momentum the need to better a high score and get higher amounts of stars is high enough without the enforced star barrier at the end of each level. It’s about the only misstep in what is a compact and focused game.\n\nThe boss fights themselves have the same ten second time limit and you also have your shurikens removed.

Never has solely completing a level felt so unsatisfying and unfulfilling as it does here.\n\nThe concept of 10 Second Ninja is simple, Robot Hitler has raised an army of robots and you are tasked to stop him. Using only a katana and ninja stars (you only get 3!) you are charged in clearing a map of the evil Nazi robots as quickly as physically possible. As the name suggests the overall time you are able to take per map is a slim 10 seconds, although you soon realise that completing the level is merely the beginning of your quest.\n\nAt the end of each zone you get a "boss fight" with Robot Hitler himself! Hitler will use his mouth lasers to try and kill you whilst you do your best to not only dodge them but to avoid the obstacles in the environment whilst going in for the kill. This little mini game at the end of each zone is a nice little break as it plays out a little differently to what you are used to with the previous levels.\n\n10 Second Ninja not only gives you a completion time per level, it is also accompanied with a star rating system. Achieving the full three stars seems easy at first as the basic levels allow you to over perform with their simplistic layouts and easily avoided obstacles, however as you progress the game begins to really test you and you begin to be relieved at mere completion.\n\nAlthough entertaining at first the game itself can become incredibly annoying to play and after a while you start to develop a strong hatred against those blasted Nazi robots! Controversially however I would say this is also one of it's biggest appeals. The taunting of seeing how painfully close you are to maximum stars provides you the drive you need to perform over and over again, shaving those precious seconds off your time. Maybe, just maybe, if you jump here and throw there you can grab that elusive third star!\n\nConsidering how much you end up listening to the background tracks they never get monotonous and annoying which is a flaw that so many similar titles have endured. The music is fun and light hearted that when coupled with the sound effects offers a friendly environment to perform mass Nazi robot murder. In fact I only have one gripe audio wise and that is within the cut scenes. I feel that they really would have benefited from a voice over, maybe a Siri-esc style voice for Hitler to add to it's comedic value. The only issue with that of course is you always have to bear in mind that Indie games never come with a big budget and voice actors are expensive!\n\nI have played this title both on my PC and with a controller at EGX Rezzed and I have to say it feels much more natural on the controller. The controller allows you to react much quicker than the keyboard and the keyboard left me with constant hand ache because of how you have to position your hands over the keys. There is an option to remap the keys which I elected to take but I really would recommend the controller, purely because it will make your experience much smoother and pain free.\n\nOverall the game isn't aweful, it does seem a little short lived but hey, what can you expect for only £6.99? Value for money is great here for initial gameplay, however after the buzz has worn off and you have perfected your levels, you really don't have much of a reason to continue playing. As annoyed as I was throughout, I just couldn't find myself putting this game down. It was far too addictive and once I was reeled in I was held there for many many hours. I found myself sneaking on every time I had a few minutes just to attempt to beat some levels that little bit faster. It's quirky, fun and enjoyable, everything you would expect from an indie title. Dan Pearce has done an excellent job with this title and I am looking forward to seeing what he brings to the table in the future.\n\n6/10 - A great game, but short lived.\n","July 29, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lose plot revolves around a robot Hitler and a ninja having to destroy robots with a big sword. It’s not likely to win best screenplay but then sometimes you just want to jump around and hit things.\n\nA platform game mixed with a heavy puzzle element, the main gameplay gimmick is that you only have ten second with which to complete each stage. The timer only starts after you make your first move which means you can spend some time surveying the single screen style levels in an attempt to work out the best route to victory.\n\nYour Ninja has a couple of skills to help along the way. You can use three shurikens in each level and also double jump. You’ll need to work out the best enemies to hit with throwing stars in advance as it can be the difference between victory and defeat if you use them in the wrong place. Shurikens can also be used to set off icicle falls, which in turn can crush robots for you.\n\nYou’ll need to complete levels as quickly as possible as well as you're awarded between one to three stars upon completion. You’ll start out completely mystified as to how you get the two or three star ratings but as you progress it all becomes clearer. Getting three stars on levels does require almost Jedi like reflexes though.\n\nThe levels themselves are a mixture of floating platforms, spikes and collapsing stones. More obstacles and enemies are added as the game progresses and you also have to contend with some good old fashioned ice stages as well. Everything is there for a reason and that reason is for you to plan your assault and deal with the robots as quickly as possible.\n\nThe star system does create a problem however, as you are required to collect a certain amount before taking on each areas boss. In our view the requirement is set a touch too high and we can see players hitting a complete dead end at times. In a game all about speed and momentum the need to better a high score and get higher amounts of stars is high enough without the enforced star barrier at the end of each level. It’s about the only misstep in what is a compact and focused game.\n\nThe boss fights themselves have the same ten second time limit and you also have your shurikens removed. They prove to be good fun and not a massive stumbling block to progression. They are simply designed as a different sort of puzzle to work out and work well to break up the regular levels.\n\nOverall, 10 Second Ninja is a strong debut for the developer. There’s a hints of Kung Fu Rabbit and N+ (among other things), but the game also has its own distinct personality. It’s a fast, slick and fun game and one that will provide bite sized chunks of twitch gameplay.

Every time!!!!!!!!!!!!"\n\nEDIT:\n...Actually, unsure if should recommend because I just had to hard-stop it again. It's that damned auto-save I think, too many records too quick: crash.\n\nEDIT 2:\nThrice, now, the game has become irrevocably laggy. There really is no need to auto-save after every new record; the game calls for so much speed and dexterity, we (at least I) are mashing buttons (skillfully) with the quickness, even in the menus. Auto-save IS a good thing, of course, but after every record…? *Shake my head* it should be set to where it auto-saves only after you leave that level or something.\n\nTo be sure, 10 Second Ninja is a great game. Other than that (damn-near) game-breaking lag, My only complaints are:\n---I sometimes disagree with the jumping, i.e. the, er, "hit-box" of the Ninja is way bigger than it should be; when trying to jump between a narrow crevice, Ninja bumps his head far too often when it doesn't look like he should.\n---The direction in which you throw your Shurikens can be finnicky and from whence you throw the Shurikens is weird whilst double-jumping; I can't tell where exactly from within that little ball of Ninja the throwing-star issues from (many failed assassinations because the shuriken flew into the side of the cliff I was jumping over).\n\nOf course, these complaints are not legitimate because the game is designed very tightly; those two issues only add to the challenge; every millisecond counts.","January 8, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for a game to sink a lot of time into at once, this definitely won't be the game for that either unless you easily get hooked on playing short levels like this game has. Overall it's not a terrible game, just not one that's all that fun for me and I also don't feel it's quite worth the price.","November 11, 2015","false","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
