Then you should play this game because it's amazing and has a ~ridiculous~ number of puzzles in it. It's also very calm and relaxing to boot.\n\nAre you dumb? Then this game is perfect, because difficulty ranges from insultingly easy to challenging for autistics, with a nice difficulty curve that increases puzzle complexity as you go. You can stay at a difficulty level as long as you want, or you can jump to higher levels pretty quickly if you want. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING\n\nDo you like sudoku? Then I'm sorry, because sudoku is an inferior baby game for babies. If you are a baby, then by all means go play sudoku instead, you big dumb baby.\n\nThis game is so fantastic that it will put hair on your chest, even if you're a woman, so if you're a woman and you play this game, enjoy your hairy chest and awesome puzzle game.","January 6, 2014","true","8.5"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","54","58","12","1"

It's really addictive and a fantastic time waster. The game has gotten some kind of legendary status due to its extended absence from the steam store, so I'll say if you're expecting it to be the second coming of Christ in the form of a puzzle game you may be disappointed.

Well, first of all it is not really a game but rather a collection of simple mathematical riddles where you have to fill a field of nxn spaces with the correct numbers, as can be seen in the screenshots. There really isn't much more to be said, the game is nicely done and while all the riddles can be logically solved, they will keep you thinking if you choose the grid size that fits your skill.\n\nThis one has so many riddles, if you're into that kind of mathematical casual game, you have something for many hours. If you go however for achievements, it will be a real grind to get the final one.\n\nIt can't really be compared to other games, for the reasons given. It rather can be compared to riddles, such as Sudoku, and there it would stand as an own genre.\n\nRecommended: Yes","January 4, 2014","true","60.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/recommended/32150/","breakfastcompanion","Deluxe Breakfast Companion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/","1043 products in account","Pretentious Title: SquareLogic is an abstract puzzle game that takes the concept behind sudoku and twists it to create something far more interesting and engaging.  Like sudoku, the goal is to fill a square grid such that the numbers appear only once in each column and row.\n\nSquareLogic's twist on the formula is in the cage system.  Instead of prepopulating the grid with enough numbers to solve the puzzle, SquareLogic divides the board into arbitrary chunks, called cages, and assigns a mathematical rule to each.  For instance, one cage may require its content to sum to 8, another may require its smaller value to divide the larger value 4 times.  Other cages impose inequality operators on the divisions between cages, indicating that one square must contain a larger or smaller number than its neighbor.  The puzzles have extra mechanics beyond the cages as well, including double-puzzles, where two grids contain the same solution but different cages, each providing too little to solve on its own, but enough to solve when paired with the other.  Other puzzle types may leave some cages unfinished and require the player to paint them in as they go.\n\nThis formula would likely be overwhelming and tedious, especially on full-sized 9x9 puzzles (the game ranges from 4x4 to 9x9).  However, the game automatically removes numbers from tiles when that number is used elsewhere in the column/row, and players can right click any number to remove it as a viable option.  This effectively automates the more menial part of the puzzle, leaving the logical problem solving front and center.  The game also highlights possible valid combinations for cages in a small window, so you don't have to constantly keep a calculator by your side to determine what factorizations are possible for a number set.  Because of these features, the puzzles go by quickly and rarely feel like they're ever wasting your time.\n\nSquareLogic isn't flawless though.  The 4x4 puzzles are almost comically easy due to their small size, while the 9x9 and some 8x8 puzzles can become frustrating and tedious because there is simply too much information to pore over.  It becomes less a game of applying logic and more of a mindless search for the next clue you can use.  Luckily, the game still has plenty of 6x6 and 7x7 puzzles, which feel extremely well paced.\n\nAnother problem is the immediate error highlighting feature.  When you first boot up the game, go into options and turn this setting off immediately.  This setting causes the game to tell you the very instant you make a mistake.  It's a feature that is quite literally too helpful, as it quietly encourages you to start guessing whenever you begin having trouble.  With this disabled though, there's still an incredibly nice hint feature to help you out of jams.  Rather than openly tell you what's wrong, it simply highlights a section of the grid where you should be able to either eliminate possibilites or find a correct number.  It's especially useful on the large puzzles where it's easy to have too many options to pore over.\n\nThe one last problem is somewhat debatable.  The game simply has too many puzzles.  It has 6 regions, each with a staggeringly large number of available puzzles.  The first area alone contains 4800.  That is not an exaggeration.  While it certainly means the game has incredible value, it can be a little disheartening to know that you're not likely to ever even come close to finishing all of the puzzles.  Oh, and anyone obsessed with achievements would do well to avoid this game for that reason, unless you want to solve all 4800 puzzles in the first region for a cheevo.\n\nOverall, for anyone who likes abstract logic puzzles, SquareLogic is pretty much top class.  It's fun, mostly well paced, has a ton of puzzles and lots of good mechanics.  Well worth the $5 asking price.","June 25, 2014","true","84.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/recommended/32150/","hippyshake","Hippyshake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/","1352 products in account","First off: It astonishes me that this game has had such a long shelf life. I've been playing for years (prior to purchasing it on Steam), and the discussions board is still pretty active. Those who play it, generally keep playing it.\n\nSo, with a name like "Everyday Genius," it's pretty easy to be scared off; one could be forgiven for thinking this to be a hardcore math game. It isn't. It's more logic puzzle than anything else, although it remains unique. It is not like Sudoku, except that it uses numbers and the process of elimination to reach a solution.\n\nSimply put, you're presented with a single grid (to start). Inside each grid is a series of puzzle boxes that contain different mathematical symbols along with the numbers 1 through 4 (I said math isn't really needed, and I didn't lie; keep reading). An equal sign (for example "4=") inside a box simply means the answer is the number 4. Two boxes reading "3+" means that the answer will be 3, and it is achieved by adding two numbers together (1+2). Like Sudoku (which this really isn't), numbers can only be used once in each row or column. Each puzzle within the grid can be several boxes, and they are painted the same color so that you know they are one puzzle (for example, 1x2x3=6, might all be painted green). You get the idea.\n\nWhat keeps it from being less math and more logic is that mousing over any box will automatically show you all possible combinations for the solution. As you solve more puzzles inside each grid, these possible solutions will also change, due to process of elimination. Eliminated numbers will automatically disappear from each puzzle, and you can also manually remove them by right-clicking. Because of this, it really is possible to solve each grid without much math skill.\n\nThe variety offered here is stunning. You will use greater than and less than symbols; straights (3,4,5,6, etc); even / odd numbers; multiplication and division; and more. The real creativity comes when boxes arrive unpainted, leaving you to color them in with the correct colors. Color them incorrectly, and you'll be solving puzzles that don't exist, meaning your entire grid will be incorrect! Some times, you may have puzzles without any equations; other times, an entire 9x9 grid may consist of nothing but less than or greater than symbols! The difficulty level amps up until you are solving two grids simultaneously, with factors up to 9.\n\nThere is no time limit, the colors are vibrant, and the music that is here is soothing and ambient. It's casual puzzle solving at its best. There is truly nothing else like it, and it remains a classic...for those of us who actually know about it. Some people, like myself, are still playing it years later, and you'll not solve the 20,000 included puzzles (not randomly generated, by the way) any time soon.  Even better, it can be played with one hand, for those times when my grandson falls asleep on my lap!\n\nAt less than $5 US, there is not a single puzzle game on Steam that offers this much game time per penny. Highly, highly recommended.","April 4, 2015","true","22.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huffadopolis/recommended/32150/","huffadopolis","huffadopolis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huffadopolis/","429 products in account","Oh man I had forgotten about this game, it is a great casual math puzzler similar in style to a Sudoku\n\nExcept, as you can see in the screenshots there are a bunch of differently shaped colored areas like someone just won at tetris.  Each colored area has a "rule" associated with it (you can see those in the screenshots also); for example you might have to make a 4-tiled "L" shape's numbers multiply all together and equal 36.  Or rule might be that the area can only contain even numbers.\n\nYou have to use each number once per column and once per row; once you fill in a tile it automatically removes that number from the rest of the row/column for you.   As the game gets harder the rules get a bit more complex, the areas get larger, some tiles won't have the color filled in, you'll have to use your brain to figure the colors/rules, THEN the numbers for each tile.\n\nThere's really no penalty for putting the wrong number in a tile except for your "shortest number of moves to complete this one" personal best ego boost.  I also feel it does a very good job of explaining and working each new rule/aspect of gameplay as it is incorporated into the rising difficulty.\n\nBy hovering over a tile, if the rule for it's area is known, all possible solutions are shown to you so you really don't have to be super good at math; this is a logic game that uses math as a tool not as a requirement to play.  I happen to like math so I never had to use the displayed possible solutions very often but I admit there were times when it saved me a headache and the game doesn't make you feel bad about it, it displays this for every tile you hover over on purpose so you don't have to feel the pressure of MATH.\n\nOverall a fun casual puzzle game that combines simple math, 'sudoku' style numberplay, and logical processes of elimination.  I think the screenshots showing the puzzles will help pull this review together, highly suggest taking another look if this review sounds interesting.","January 3, 2014","true","46.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was taken off the Steam store for about a year, and it’s finally back, so get it before something happens again.\n\nIf you're an OCD completionist gamer or achievement hunter, however, stay far away. You'll need at least 1000 hours to complete every puzzle. And easily over 100 hours just to get all the achievements. So just be aware of what you’re getting into.\n\nBut if you like Sudoku and want to see the formula turned on its head in dozens of ways, don't think twice. Grab it. Really great way to keep your mind in shape, even just by playing for a few minutes every day.

First play the HexCells series before you invest in this. They are very similiar, yet much better. This game is more focused on numbers, and mathematical operations. Graphics are real meh - almost subpar. Music is meh. Game play is fun, in a casual coffee-break kind of way. Somewhat addicting.\n\nI would almost add that there seem to be too many levels, as well. For example, for each challenge I finished, I unlocked nearly 800 levels. Ain't nobody got time for that. Thankfully you can just 'skip to the main boss challenge thing'. Once again, HexCells gets around this with random levels (hence, infinite).\n\nI wish there was a 'maybe' option, but for this title I will give it a thumbs up with the caveat that you know what you are getting into. Its fairly cut-and-dried.","May 7, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","1"

Holy crap.\n\nThe best way to describe SquareLogic is... it is the game of which Sudoku could be one small mode.\n\nLike Sudoku, it has a rule that a number shows up once in each row and once in each column.  But beyond that:\n\n- Sudoku always subdivides the board into 9 equal squares.  SquareLogic subdivides the board in all sorts of crazy ways.  (And sometimes it doesn't even tell you where all the boundaries are.)\n\n- In Sudoku, each subdivision contains one of each number.  In SquareLogic, a subdivision has some rule about its contents, but there are many possible rules.  The contents may add to some total, or all be odd numbers, or have some ordering...\n\nThis sounds brain-exploding, but a nifty thing about SquareLogic is that it provides in-game tools for figuring out the possibilities.  (You can disable these if you are super-hardcore.)  It also introduces the gameplay very gradually.  Just a well-done number puzzle game all around!","February 6, 2011","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like an upgraded version of Sudoku, making it more fun and challenging than your average number puzzle. There are more than enough puzzles, all with interesting mechanics and twists. The soothing music goes well with the overall theme, which really polishes a well-made game. It even has achievements and Steam-cloud so you could have your profile on multiple computers. If they ever make a sequel I would instantly preorder it. Highly recommended!","May 18, 2012","true","54.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seemed too simplistic, wasn't sure if it would offer enough of a challenge and thought it might, maybe sit on my list unplayed and forgotten.  Months later, this has become my most played game on PC.  (Don't trust my 'hours played' number: I mostly play it on my laptop when I have no connection.)\n\nThere are THOUSANDS of puzzles for you to take on in this game.  They all work off of the same basic concept, with some fun little variations (such as working with two interconnected boards that share the same answers, but different formulas).  Each one offers a new challenge though and with time you pick up on the patterns and logical shortcuts that you may have missed before.\n\nAs for difficulty, you really can make it as easy or difficult as you want.  There is no "real" penalty for just guessing every single box.  So, if, for some bizarre reason, you want to just barrel through guessing the whole way, you can.\n\nOr, if you're like me, you can aim to finish each puzzle WELL below the Par number of moves with no mistakes and only the bare minimum use of the right-click-to-hide-invalid-numbers function.\n\nIf you're extremely sharp and/or have too much free time, you can also hide the box that shows the possible solution combinations.  Not an issue when you're dealing with two or three boxes, but at five or six it becomes a little more impractical; even with the solutions, you still have the challenge of figuring out the logical placement of everything.  You could be at a single puzzle for hours.\n\nIf you use a laptop like I do, you'll also probably appreciate the low demand it will place on your battery and system resources.  Makes for many hours of what we nerds consider "fun."","August 7, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
