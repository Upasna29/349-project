It is kinda strange to see the first game release after the second game. So going to divide my Review on the game into 3 simple parts\nA) The game Airline tycoon\nThis game was released during 1998,deluxe[2003] during the time there was thirst for tycoon games so this made out pretty good , Breaking down everything complex . This is a tycoon game where you are one of the owners of a airline company , you get to choose one among 4 companies and do missions where the airport manager sets a specific task as the mission goal.\nUnlike most tycoon games that tend to get serious with max info and mechanics AT1 takes a simple humorous approach.\n- Initial missions are setup so that you can learn the various aspects of the game\n- There is more than one way to win a mission, if you want you can take down your competitors and become sole survivor.\n- From reading newspaper in the airport to sabotage it has everything you can imagine.\n- Sweet music\nOverall its a fun tycoon game that can satisfy anyone playing it there is also the freeform mode where you can play without any goals, multiplayer if you can get it work. The graphics presentation hides the complexity of the game so its easier for new players to play the game\nB) Airline Tycoon Deluxe VS Airline Tycoon 2 Gold\nNow on the steam store you will find there are two game with the name airline tycoon , The second is the sequel to the first game released by kalypso. It makes me extremely sad to talk about this sequel because it is a terrible experience, Instead of Improving the first game this sequel got everything wrong and made it worst and terrible. Needless to say airline tycoon deluxe is the final iteration of the game vs airline tycoon 2 gold which is the final version of the sequel.\nI have ripped upon the second game more than once  but will post why the first game is better\n- AT 1 has a better presentation and ui compared to the jumbled basic terrible stuff AT2 has.\n- The planes used in AT1 have real names aka Boeing , airbus etc so you know what is good and what is bad. AT2 features computer generated random names 486 dx 2 is a plane name////\n- AT 1 Despite being released in 1998 looks nice and plays better (if compatibility is set properly) AT2 runs like garbage on any system and looks terrible.\n- AT deluxe has a lot of features content wise , AT 2 gold just added the features in AT 1 as dlc.\nSo yeah Airline Tycoon 2 was a disaster of a sequel none of us AT 1 fans wanted to see but at least we have the first game back.\n\nC. Game compatibility with modern systems\n\n-Unfortunately No doubt that Airline Tycoon deluxe is a awesome game but , The game is over 10 years old so no doubt there will be issues with it running on modern systems and newer os.\nSadly The game engine itself has a certain limits of the time as in it runs in around 20-30fps an can slowdown when there is too much on screen. Aka a lot people in the airport etc.\n-Also Frequent multiple saving is recommended the game itself will save at the end of each day but sometimes the game will crash for no reason , The instances where i have seen it happen are a)music change b) sometimes the game will crash no matter what you do it could be due to a specific even but event if you restore save it will crash again at the same time aka lets say game crashed at Monday 16.20 , if you restore again it will crash at the same time. hence multiple saves is recommended.\n- The game original developers are long gone so fixes and patches are hard to come by.\n\nIf you can get this game to work , Its one of cult classic tycoon games that will kill time quickly.\nClick on the Fire Extinguisher when you see it for some fun","December 1, 2014","true","16.6"," 64 of 64 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","64","64","2","2"

From the sterotypical characterisation of the tycoons around nationality (The Russian guy wears red and has caviar in his office) to the 'Shady' PetrolAir backroom, this game focuses on what alot of people seem to be missing form games - HAVING FUN\n\nDo not get me wrong, there is some fairly good airline simulation here from aircraft types ranging in distances, seats and fuel consumption - to the managing of the fuel market and personel. Its not massivly involved, but more than enough to keep you interested.\n\nAs mentioned the graphics are not current standard - because this game was released in 1998. Its fairly cartoony but it has a very distinct style to it which - personally - I really like. Again, take any graphics reviews with a pinch of salt, this is an old game.\n\nOverall I would really recomend this game. There is alot to keep you interested in the airline management but nothing hugely daunting with a very nice tutorial to guide you. A game with alot of charm and style","November 18, 2014","true","9.1"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","39","40","0","0"

This game was basically my childhood and for the whole primary school was teaching me maths and geography in a very entertaining way - managing my own airline! This is not any boring, usual tycoon because it is not limited in any way to reading tons of reports, here you have to walk around the airport by yourself and iteract with NPCs to take care of your business, taking part in funny dialogues and other forms of first class humour! In contrary to other reviewers I think the graphics did not get old at all because Airline Tycoon was all drawn in kind of comic book/caricature style. The music, originally composed for midi format is kinda pleasant as well (but for non-nostalgy driven ♥♥♥♥♥♥s like me it might start to annoy after some time).

The difficulty is extremely low, the only way i ever went bankrupt was because I didn't know how the game mechanic worked.

You need to buy a filofax and a cellphone so you dont have to keep going back to your office, once you unlock your laptop you can carry out orders from anywhere and make some changes to your planes. You can even hire a saboteur to make life hard for your opponents, from placing heavily salted food on board, to giving them a computer virus, or even planting a bomb in their office or causing a plane crash! Of course the airport manager will eventually find out it's you and a hefty fine will come your way.\nLike any good CEO, you need to keep the cash coming in and the expenses low, for this you have to hire and fire staff, your friendly personnel team will help you out with this, and you can hire advisors to give you a little edge over the competition. You can buy and sell shares of the other 3 airlines, as well as buy and sell planes. You have so much to work with and at first it can be a struggle to juggle it all, but as I said, your lovely advisor will chip in whenever you feel clueless, she is a button click away.\n\nSound:\nAs said above, the soundtrack is very charming and upbeat, definitely a good choice to have this kind of music. The ambience is top notch and makes you feel like you are in the airport. Unfortunately you can't seem to change the music but why would you want to, and the music settings are a little hard to balance because some sound effects are rather loud to begin with, so spend some time balancing ambience, music and sound effects\n\nVisuals:\nIt's a 2003 game so don't expect anything fancy, but the cartoon style graphics and smooth frame rate make this game very very enjoyable to play, the game will only lag if you use the cheat to bring a massive crowd to the airport (i think this is just cosmetic).\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nUnfortunately I never managed to play this game on multiplayer so I can't comment on this, but I'm sure your imagination will tell you it's rather fun, the AI in the game is so predictable that I can remember exactly who drops first, second and third to leave me as the sole CEO, because of what they do (issuing more shares, overzealous sabotage leading to excessive fines from the airport manager\n\nOverall:\nI give this game a 9, it's hard to flaw given that it was a very very good game at the time, I seem to remember that in the early 2000s to 2005 there was an influx of rather good tycoon and simulation games, for example Monopoly Tycoon, Mall Tycoon, Rollercoaster Tycoon (who can forget that), Hotel Giant and The Sims, I'll have no problems in admitting Airline Tycoon should also be on that list.\n\nGet this game, it's £7 and you'll have lots of fun with it, just make sure to get your security up to scratch first!","March 16","true","11.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The new short-term memory game is to remember which airports have which abbreviations in their schedules (London is LHR, for instance) - the airline-schedule side of the screen uses the airport-abbreviation codes, and the ticket side of the screen uses the city name. Then assign the tickets to the planes in the most efficient way so you aren't flying the planes empty too often - using a bit of trial an error, since you haven't memorized the airport abbreviations yet.\n\nAnd the short-term memory game is made harder because your guy has to actually WALK between the travel agencies and your office. Repeatedly. Picking up no more than six tickets at a time. (And really, no more than three tickets, because the profitability of about half of the tickets is abysmal.) While you try to remember which plane has a capacity of 180 passengers, and which plane has a capacity of 90 passengers, and which city it's in so it can get to the ticket's starting city in time, and when it's available, and dangit, this much memorization just isn't fun. I found myself wondering whether the game should do this scheduling automatically, only to realize that this short-term memory thing is supposed to *be* the game.\n\nAlso, don't work for Honey Airlines. Their office is the one furthest away from the travel agencies, so your guy spends even longer walking.","March 13","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics represented in this game is simple and easier for new or hardcore gamers. I play a heck out of it during my school years.\n\nAirline Tycoon Deluxe is the compilation of the first game, Airline Tycoon: First Class and the Airline Tycoon Evolution which add more contents to the core games. The game dev is no more. Right now the games was just distribute by some other publishers. So, no any new fix etc. This is the good games, don't compare it to the abomination 'sequel' by Kalypso, Airline Tycoon 2. That game is utter garbage bearing the name of Airline Tycoon legacy. Just stick with this one.\n\nI ran the game in W7 64 bits and it is fine (no steam overlay though). It is what it is.
