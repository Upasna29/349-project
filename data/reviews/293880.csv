Great Fusion! [/h]\n\nI bought 'Dark Scavenger', not really expecting too much. I figured it'd be a good way to waste an hour or so, in between more weighty games. However, I was hugely surprised by how good this game actually is.\n\nIf you've ever played a 'Lone Wolf' or 'Fighting Fantasy' book, you'll be very familiar with the way the game is played - each "page" (location you visit, chosen by arrows) has an encounter (sometimes multiple) for you to take part in, whether it's a conversation, a fight, or an item to gain via a little puzzle. This harkens back to the early-mid 90s attempts to capture these style of gamebooks on PCs; Dark Scavenger manages to achieve this in a way I've never experienced before.\n\nThe game's story follows you, a "Dark Scavenger", a being that can siphon the energy out of planets, and a crew of misfits who find you floating in space. The characters are a wacky bunch, but are also very interesting in spite of their "zany" initial appearances. There are a lot of excellent conversations to be had within the game, and the "dark comedy" tagline it advertises is not a misnomer at all - I've found myself laughing a lot at the various scrapes and events happening to the protagonist.\n\nGraphically, the game is simple yet aesthetically pleasing. There's barely any animation, aside from some flashes when weapons attack and so on. However, this really isn't necessary, as the game manages to get across everything it needs to with the little animation it provides. It still manages to provide exciting combat and fleshed out environments. Likewise, the music and sound effects of the game are apt also. Abandoned areas really feel abandoned due to the subtle sounds, and I defy you to dislike the jaunty battle music!\n\nThe battle system is very similar to classic JRPGs like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy. You fight alone, but have three options for each attack: 'Weapon' - direct attacks with weapons, 'Item' - use a variety of items with various effects, and 'Ally' - summon one of your many allies to help you out in the combat. Combine this with a huge amount of weapons, items, and allies, each with a limited number of uses, and you have a really varied and interesting battle system, yet one that is simplistic enough to be able to dive right into. Gaining new Weapons/Items/Allies is as simple as finding loot, each piece of which can be crafted into one of the three aforementioned categories. Therefore, you sometimes have to make very crucial decisions - is that one of a kind power-belt better turned into a mega-mace for attacking, an athletics-item, or a strong ally? You only have one, so which will it be?\n\nThe bottom line is that this is a very cheap game for what it brings. If you enjoyed the classic adventure/choose-your-own-adventure games from yesteryear, especially Lone-Wolf, then this is the game for you. I planned to play it for an hour or so while I waited for a movie to begin. I never saw that movie - I didn't see why on earth I'd stop playing this game!","May 25, 2014","true","11.4"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","66","72","0","5"

All the artwork in the game looks like it was hand drawn and the developers use the minimalist static character design in a great and often fantastically funny way. The gaming world seems so focused on graphics nowadays they forget that graphics simply accentuate a game design, they do not make a game great. A great game touches a gamer's emotions and draws them into the world the designer has created. This game will absolutely suck you in and make you chuckle, chortle, guffaw, cackle, snicker, and maybe even regret (there can be some surprisingly dark consequences to your actions in such a light-hearted game.)\n\nSo how to describe the game.. I'll start off by saying you will spend most of your time in this game reading. If you don't enjoy reading in your games then I suggest you move on right now. If you do enjoy reading then I highly suggest this zany space opera-esque adventure in which you are a Dark Scavenger! Your spaceship is out of fuel and it is up to you, the courageous Dark Scavenger who will use Your Mother as a meatbag to absorb about a million archer arrows meant for you, in order to save the day! This game plays like an epic game of MadLibs, but instead of just picking random adverbs and adjectives to make a story you will pick from your selection of Weapons, Tools, and Allies to deal with events that pop up, often resulting in laugh out loud situations. How do you get those weapons, tools, and allies you may ask? Well the game is broken into chapters. At the beginning of each chapter you will start with some sort of event in which you choose from a few dialogue choices. After an event ends there is a strong chance you will get some sort of weird object generously called "loot". After the event ends you'll be looking at a map of scenery in which you can point and click on various objects on the map. Clicking on those objects can often trigger events and lead to more loot, so scan that map closely! After you have found everything on that map there will be arrows you click on to lead you along to the next part of the map. After you click the arrow, if you found any loot, you will briefly be whisked away back to your three space alien buddies who happen to be excellent crafters. Lucky you. You will then turn your "loot" over to one of the three crafters and they will offer some sort of funny explanation to what weapon, tool, or ally they will create for you. Now that you have your real loot, what do you do with it? Well when you happen upon an event you are usually given several options of how you wish to deal with it, and are almost always given an option to use a weapon, tool, or ally to help you out. In each chapter of the game you only have X amount of uses of any given weapon, tool, or ally, so choose wisely (I found myself choosing by how funny I thought the result would read!) You do regain the uses in the next chapter though, so don't be afraid of using what you need to use. You'll work your way around the map from room to room in such a manner, gaining loot and power until you reach the end of the chapter where you'll face a boss.\n\nI've had such a blast playing through this game, and there is a New Game + mode so you can go back through the game and hand the loot over to different crafters than you did the first time so there is good replayability. Highly suggested for anyone who would enjoy reading about a wacky sci-fi adventure in which you create funny situations based on your actions in your epic quest for fuel and salvation from an ominous universal being. Worth every penny and I wish there were more adventures like this.","October 11, 2014","true","10.4"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","27","29","3","2"

Its too much for the kind of game Dark Scavenger is. Even getting the game on sale at $2.50 feels a bit like a gyp.  Dark Scavenger, and I know I'm going to get crapped on for saying this, feels and looks a lot like a flash game you could play for free on newgrounds. Hell, you could watch a playthrough start to finish on youtube and not lose much of the experience of actually playing it. There's not much to it.\n\nFirst: some people keep insisting Dark Scavenger is part jRPG. This is untrue. The closest the game gets to being a traditional jRPG is having menu driven combat and that's it. There's very little RPG about Dark Scavenger. It is almost entirely a choose your own adventure point and click game.\n\nDark Scavenger is a real one-note game. Its very search about the screen for things to click on, an event triggers, fight maybe, "scavenge" an item, and craft it into equipment to use in events/fights. That's really all it is. Lather, rinse, repeat.There's no real challenge. There are only bad guesses at what to do during an event. The battles themselves are similar in that while you may choose the best weapon or item to use against enemies, luck usually plays role in how effective they are if they work at all.\n\nThe sole thing Dark Scavenger has going for it is the writing. What the game lacks in depth, it makes up for with screwy odd-ball over the top writing and art direction which is usually amusing and adds a great deal of charm. Sadly, that's really the only thing Dark Scavenger has that's any good. That's what most of the positive reviews are raving about.","August 10, 2014","false","1.6"," 62 of 92 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","62","92","4","0"

Well, the game went on sale with the Thanksgiving sale, bought it for almost 3 bucks, and stayed up all night playing it, it was that good.\n\nYou play an alien that's stranded out in space, who soon comes across a galactic being who wants to consume you. After defeating him you're left to rot in space for years and eventually you're picked up by a group of aliens called the Dark Scavengers who are pretty much intergalactic junkers who invite you to join their crew if you can help them by finding a fuel source for their ship. This leads you to going down to the nearest planet full of your typical medieval fantasy setting including a race of giant masked wrestlers, crazy drunk bandits,  and an armored smart ♥♥♥ space raptor with a giant gun who wants you dead.\n\nThe story for this game is absolutely amazing. There are constant twists in the story, characters that you get emotionally invested in, and even extremely interesting concepts that get explored. Each character has their own personality and always has you wanting to learn more about them. You'll constantly be laughing at the crazy situations and humorous characters you find yourself interacting with.\n\nUnlike Mass Effect 3, your choices actually matter in this game. You can kill everything you come across right away, or talk to them and get useful items and information or even backstabbed. There's several different endings depending on what you do in the final chapter.\n\nThe combat is a bit different from other rpgs. There is no leveling up in this game. Combat is focused around finding objects through battle and having the dark scavengers turn them into either weapons, items, or allies. The vast majority of objects (i'm talking around 95%) have multiple options on what you can turn them into. You may find a bone that you can turn into a weapon that does wind damage, a controller which increases your damage for the next turn, or a zombie ally. You may only choose one of these, and you can't go back on your choice. All items, allies, and weapons have a certain number of uses before they break, and you won't get to use them anymore till they replenish at the start of the next chapter, making it so you have to have a balanced between all 3 categories. The only flaw in this system is that the majority of the time the Dark Scavengers don't give you good hints on what they're about to make for you.\n\nCombat is done with you going first followed by all enemies. You can stun enemies using elements they're weak against, which loses them their turn, allows you to use stuff that's strong vs stun against them the next turn, and refills your healing potion (restores you to full health when you click it). Enemies are even strong vs certain elements which makes them take little damage\n\nAlso all weapons, items, and allies have different characteristics. A weapon might be a long bladed weapon or a short blunted staff, or fast strong ally. You may run into an event (events happen regularly) which you need a long bladed weapon to attack with, or you may get stuck in a whirlpool which you need a strong ally to help you out. There are also weapons and allies that effect certain enemies, like ones with their mouths open or enemy with their feet on the ground. This adds a lot of uniqueness to the game.\n\nThe game takes about 4 and a half hours to beat, but once you do you get access to New Game Plus. Once you beat it you'll be wishing that there was a sequel to continue the story (which the ending sets up for). I honestly recommend buying this for full price, it's only 5 bucks, but you'll more than get your money's worth.","November 29, 2014","true","7.6"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

The motivation for progression stems from the little side stories and the overall brilliant writting of snippets. If you like bizarre writing along the lines of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or anything by Monty Python, you'll love Dark Scavenger.\n\nGraphics: Old-school vibe highly reminiscent of fantasy novel covers of the late 80s and early 90s. It does not look great, but it surely has character.\n\nSound: The weakest link of the game. The effects are highly repetitive and there is a lack of variety in music. The little there is, is good however.\n\nGameplay: Adventure point-and-click exploration mixed with classical turn-based RPG combat. The choices you make can influence whether you'll have to fight someone or you might have him/her on your side later on. Nontheless, the combat system gets repetitive later on, since once you figured out the weaknesses of the enemies, you'll stick to specific attack patterns that are most effective.\n\nTL;DR: Dark Scavenger is a bizarre and genuinely funny game with a playtime of roughly 5 hours. Afterwards it also features a New Game Plus mode. Worth the asking price!","May 20, 2014","true","6.1"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","1"

This game. Where do I. What do I. I don't even.\n\nOkay, get a grip. You've seen crazy before. You've read crazy before in books, calm down, this is fine, everything is fine, take the pills, breathe. Relax, relax. Okay, Dark Scavenger - Roleplaying game, mostly a point and click with turn based combat, though without levelling (that's handled with the loot you gain opening up progressively more and more powerful tools as the game progresses), where you play the part of "an human" who for some reason ended up in space, alone, with naught but a spacesuit on. At least, I hope you've a space suit on. You meet a creature called "Den", a big giant spacefaring blob, who beats you up and leaves you for dead.\n\nWhen you come around you find yourself on a ship home to three alien scavengery sorts, who immediately promote you, you lucky soul, to general gopher, and person who's going to get beaten senseless. In exchange, they agree to convert any loot you find into items that will surely help you to help them keep their rickety little spaceship going. Cue the game proper beginning. You are told that the ship is nearly out of fuel but thankfully the planet nearby happens to have a fuel source, unfortunately, it's in the hands of the bandits. You've been told that you're off to get the fuel, in exchange for your continued passage on the ship, and the services of your three newfound friends.\n\nMechanically, you move from room to room, represented by static screens with highlighted "hot spots" which bring up text style choose your own adventure style dialogs, depending on what you pick you may end up in combat situations, or you may gain items, or gain life / lose life, or even end up dead. Such is the way of the game, the events are far, far off the insane end of the spectrum, and you'll quickly find that your arsenal will consist of things that shouldn't make sense, whilst fighting things that make no sense.\n\nThere is a story in the madness somehow, in so much as your arrival may well change events which are playing out on the planet you've just landed on, but given the madness inherent in what you're playing it's a bit hard to make out all the fine details when you end up creating "your mother" as an ally (no, not a joke, you can summon your mother as an ally, and she stuns all opponents if you're at low health). The best way to enjoy this game is to take it on it's own terms, almost as a Hitchhiker's guide with fighting thrown in, for the ridiculously low price point - it's a steal, and an easy sell in my book, for any RPG fan.\n\nJust don't play this game on any psychoactive or hallucinogenic substances.","May 18, 2014","true","6.1"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","36","56","0","2"

One of three aliens aboard the ship you reside – Kamaho an undead weapons master, Falsen a greenish trickster, and Gazer a mute and very alien alien – will forge the artifact into something unique.\n\nStory and writing are the main selling points of Dark Scavenger.

I digress.  Dark Scavenger is a bit point and click, a bit hidden object, a bit text based D&D choice driven adventure with quite a bit melee mixed in using the crafted weapons, items and allies one has managed to scavenge and a whole lot weird.  Odd characters, even stranger allies, and relatively conceited enemies make this game uniquely interesting.  This game seems simpler then it actually is, and dying can happen easily by making wrong decisions or choices.  Choices really matter, especially in combat where melee attacks are limited to what weapons one has available to use.  Hopefully along the way one has made the correct decisions on who to craft with, where one has looked for items, what information one has managed to gather and what action has been taken in a situation.  As I stated before this game seems far easier then it actually is and requires thought and planning to get through.  Though I did not pay full price, I would have.

There is also a "New Game +" option that allows you to keep all your zanny items in a new game. (Although, I can imagine it becoming stale around the third play-through.)\n\nNo matter how silly it gets, the plot is always thick and riveting, boarder-lining on corny without over-doing it and making you lose interest. There's a few ways the game can go plot-wise, and there are a multitude of endings to stumble upon. Yet, saying more then; "You are stranded on a foreign planet with a quirky crew of aliens, and your main mission is finding a fuel-source for your star-cruise in order to get back home" would spoil the game, so I'll stop while I'm ahead.\n\nIts art is amazing in my opinion (reminds me of a more comical Alex Pardee), and the writing is top-notch (90's si-fy with post-modern humor). The overall tone of the game is very gothic/dark, so if you don't like that style, this may not be for you. Which reminds me, quick warning, there are some jokes/dialogue in this title that can offend younger gamers, or the squeemish XD.\n\nThe game can be ridiculous at times, but it mearly does so to poke fun at itself.\n\nIf you can catch this gem on sale, trust me, you won't regret it!\n\nWhen it comes to point and click games,\nI hereby rate you:                  -8.5/10\n\nIf you're asking how does it stack up against to rest of my game library....\nThen I would say:                   -6.5/10\n\nBut I ain't THAT picky.\nSo, a solid passing grade of:    -7.5/10    it is :D","August 9, 2014","true","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokosabre/recommended/293880/","kokosabre","Koko Sabre *Scruffy*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokosabre/","1185 products in account",""Hey, Kamaho, what can you make out of this rope?"  "Mmm, Homing Missiles? " Uhm, okay, Get on it."\nDark Scavenger puts you in the roll of a human(or something like that, game doesnt say) "lost" in space and you are being saved by 3 aliens who then sent you on a dangerous mission to help them out (what a save!!). Game combines Point-and-click exploration, text-based adventures and RPG turn-based combat and decision making but the main thing that grab me is the variety of tools given to you.\n\nStory\n\nWhile the writing is top notch, its focused on the moment so there isnt that big plot to follow( its just stuff given at the start of the game and then at the end) so you can just focus on your exploration. During your adventure you will get help from your 3 alien allies :  Kamaho - weapon crafter and fills the role of the generic NPC you often meet in the games( always serious!!!) ; Falsen - the master of puns( bad or good its all up to you) ; Gazer - alien without mouth but always seems that he is trying to talk. With the help of the gang( by making stuff for you while you do the fighting) you need to find a fuel source(well they found it but you need to get it) so they can survive in SPACE. The source is on a planet near you so they beam you down and you start your adventure.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay consists of Exploration, "Crafting"/Equipment and Combat.\n\nExploration\n\nThe funniest part of the game. Now lets see what steps you can take while exploring : First you are in a room with several objects to interact with . Always be careful how you pick them because it matters at times ( Example : I crushed a cage with a bird inside because it bit me but on the next object I clicked I found bird food so I ended up losing an item). Once you click on an object you will enter the text adventures which often leads to decision making which includes dialogues or actions.\n\nFor actions you will be mainly asked how to proceed : use your bare hands/body, use weapon/item/ally or go back.  Using the right KIND of equipment always lead to success while using yourself mainly leads to harm.\nDialogues are weird because well... cant say really... it's just that often make no sense. Sometimes there is logic sometimes is completly random.\n\nOnce you interact with all objects you found(some can be well hidden) you have to go to another room by clicking on an arrow(you dont need to interact with all objects if you dont want to risk it). But before you are send to the next room you will have to use the items you found which leads to\n\nEquipment and crafting\n\nmaking new tools for your adventures. Now lets start with equipment(or you can call them items/tools w/e you want since you dont really equip them as in other games) . There are 3 kind of tools on your disposal : Weapons, Items(consumables) and Allies. Each one of them got durability . Whenver you use them(combat or exploring), the items lose 1 durability unless its stated otherwise.\n\nI dont think I need to explain how to use them since each one of them got short and well written description though it needs sometime to get used to how the game plays itself but lets get on the more important part: how you acquire this stuff. Well, you give them to your allies on the ship.\n\nKamaho can make weapons, Falsen can make items and Gazer makes you allies(dont ask how because I have a bit of a hard time imagining). You can use them only once per visit(aka you cant use 2 items to make 2 allies in 1 visit) so you have to pick wisely what you want out of each item(dont do like me where I decided to turn a sacred amulet into a weapon and ended up with a pointless stick). This trick gives quite high replay value to the game if you want to see what kind of items the devs got prepared for you. And once you are done crafting lets start fighting.\n\nCombat\n\nCombat is generic turn-based system. You need exploit the weaknesses of your enemies or die trying. One thing worth noticing is that not every item you use ends your turn(its show in the right bottom corner in a box if it ends your turn or not). I found the combat to be quite challenging because of the durability system so it requires some thinking in case you end up needing a tool for later. But stay calm, at the start of each chapter you will get back all the charges and items back to use so feel free to use them as much as you want.\nSave system is quite nicely made since it saves after each interaction so if you die during combat you will be put at the start of the fight unless the enemy got forms.. then it will restart from the last form( example : boss has 2 forms, you were able to reach 2nd form and you died so game will restarts from 2nd form).\n\nReplay value and lenght\n\nAs said the game has a decent replay value ( 4-6 runs or a lot more if you want to find everything) and the lenght is able to allow that ( average 3 hours). There is a New Game+ that I'm yet to try so cant talk about it.\n\nIs it worth it?\nAnswer this questions:\nDo you like text-based adventures?\nDo you like silly/random writing?\nDo you like challenging turn-based combat?\nDo you like replaying games?\nIf you have 3 yes then go ahead and buy it. If not... you can still buy it and give it a whirl but I can say that its worth every penny .\n","March 12","true","6.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oncus/recommended/293880/","Oncus","Oncus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oncus/","239 products in account","Dark Scavenger is a fairly unique game and represents a hidden gem of the indie scene.  The main focuses of the game are on decision making, story, combat (a more fun version of JRPG combat style), humor, and loot. Loot in this game is not your regular loot, but more on that later.\n\nEach level is composed of multiple areas and (you don't need to visit every one), and each area has interactive objects that you can click on. This procs either combat, dialogue with decisions that have major impact, loot, or combination of those. A clever dialogue option and/or a smart use of your items, yields rewards, but  also keep in mind, if you don't focus on the game, you may get punished as well (don't worry, there is barely any memorization).\n\n\nLoot has a central part in  the game and after each area transition you get your friends (a skeleton engineer, crazy green alien in a suit, and an alien that can't speak) to make weapons, items or allies out of it. They each explain what loot will you get from them in their own unique way (remember the alien that can't speak?). It's not always obvious what will you get, but that's what makes the game even more interesting.\n\nAll in all, Dark Scavenger offers a refreshing experience and a rewarding story if you enjoy games with dialogue options and relatively unique mix of gameplay elements.","December 8, 2014","true","14.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Let me tell you how it is:\n\nPicture this if you'd be so kind:  space.  It's unfathomably huge and mostly empty, but you've come across a place where in the background you can see a stream of stars.  Nearby is a sun pounding atoms together to make heavier and heavier elements and putting out the energy of 6 trillion nuclear bombs per second as a by-product.  A few hundred million miles off are some planets; generators of storms guaranteed to instantly pressure cook anything wrought by feeble mortal hands, but only tiny marbleized orbs from your point of view.  This is so real and awesome, you think to yourself.  How could it possibly get any better?  Well, maybe there's a barbarian with a giant axe.  And if that weren't enough, the barbarian is having a no-holds-barred punch-up with a robot micro-universe, the Xenomorph from Alien, and Jesus Christ if he were an alien with a super laser gun.  They are firing rays that go "pew-pew!" and there are explosions and a spaceship and a unicorn runs by!  You cannot believe that this is totally real and you are seeing it!  And what can you even do in the midst of such an amazing scenario?  The only thing a man can do:  swing his rusty sword for 5 damage.\n\nDark Scavenger is kind of like that, but even better!  This game will take you on an amazing and hilarious adventure with an ultra-simple interface reminiscent of games like Dragon Warrior, Earthbound, and Pokemon.  Of course, without the limitations of old cartridges, Dark Scavenger is free to elaborate on its story and make sure you're never bored.  The graphics are static images, but look quite nice (I don't think the screenshots in Steam did them justice) and despite the simplistic nature of it all Dark Scavenger manages to create a game you'll never forget.\n\nYou remember playing those RPGs and getting a little giddy when you finally leveled up and unlocked an awesome sounding new move for your character?  You didn't even care what it did or if you could only do it a couple of times; you totally used that move on the next Level 1 Fuzzy Bunny you came up against.  Dark Scavenger's gameplay manages to capture that feeling in every single encounter.  Rather than leveling up and gaining better hit points or attack prowess, you gain loot.  But instead of simply strapping this loot on to your hurly-burly self, you give it to one of your three allies who will make you a new weapon, item, or ally to call upon.  Every one of these is unique and it never manages to get samey.  And as your allies tease you with what awesome choices lie before you, you'll find yourself in gleeful agony trying to pick your prize.  Each thing has limited uses, but can be used in combat for obvious reasons or choose-your-own-adventure style narrative pieces where having an applicable tool will give you the best rewards or the coolest outcome to your actions.  Thanks to this, nothing is ever useless and you never experience the grind of other RPGs.  Encounters come and go and don't get replayed.  Dark Scavenger is nothing if not perpetually fresh.\n\nSo let's say I haven't sold this game to you yet.  Yeah, by passing up on Dark Scavenger, you'll save about 1/24th of what it takes to get a new release that's one of those comittee designed polygon orgies that's like a movie you press buttons to watch.  Or, you could buy this game that has the heart to make you want to replay it years down the line, the balls to ask a couple bucks for a mostly text-driven sci-fi fantasy adventure, and the kind of brain that'll give you disco dancing space goblins if you give it a chance.  I know where I'd rather put half of my lunch money, sir.\n\nOr, if you take the advice of some other reviewers, you could just watch a let's play of Dark Scavenger, since it's one of those games where once you've seen the whole thing there's only minor differences to see.  Fair enough.  But, hey, if you do that and you actually have fun watching, why not buy the game?  For how little it costs on sale, it's basically like buying the devs a beer.  And then maybe they'll make more!","February 11, 2015","true","6.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","12","19","5","0"

My expectations were fulfilled, and I still had a lot of fun.\n\nIf you like casual, comedic turn-based RPGs that remind you of those choose-your-own-adventure books (decision trees), then you will probably really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the artstyle is definitely not the best, however, it is stll nice and works well with the overall feel and atmosphere of the game. The music and sounds are decent.\n\nThe story is okay, nothing too crazy. Your 3 teammates are available to talk to between missions, each with different personalities. My favorite is the alien who has no mouth, and communicates solely with exaggerated gestures.\n\nThe controls are simple - you just need to click your mouse to select options in battle. The beginning of the game puts you in a quick, informative tutorial battle. The learning curve is minimal, and you are not really punished for dying because you can restart at different points and will even have your potion (refills over time) at refilled if you decide to retry your last battle.\n\nDuring battle, you can use different weapons (durability dicatates how many times you can use it), items, and/or allies to help you succeed. You can also use your fists to attack, which will not reduce any durability from your equipment. Next to your health, a potion that refills over time puts you back to full health can be used.\n\nAfter you win a battle, your enemies will drop loot. Then, you can choose to explore the area you are in before moving on to a new one. When you explore, many times you will come across an event and have to make decisions - potentially resulting in loss/gain of health, avoiding/not avoiding a battle, or trading/using an item to get a different one (doing this reduces your chosen equipment's durability by 1). I have noticed that when you move on to a new mission all of your items will be restocked and refilled.\n\nWhen you are done looting and exploring, you can choose to move to any applicable area (left, right, up, or down). After you select an arrow, you will be presented with your ship's room, where you can use your loot and give it to one of 3 crewmembers. This is probably one of the best parts of the game.\n\nEach Dark Scavenger specializes in different things (weapons, items, allies), and they can only be used once per room visit, meaning that you can't simply use all your loot to keep making weapons (if you have more than 1 loot per room visit).\n\nThe funniest thing here is that the information your teammates will give you is based on their personality, so you have to decide who to use based on their responses, rather than knowing exactly what will be made. For example, if you have a broken sword loot item and hover over each teammate, they will tell you what they think they can make with it, but the rest is up to your interpreation - since the ally crafter has no mouth, he will use gestures to try to show what he can make with your loot (ex: he holds his arms out like a zombie = zombie ally | he nuzzles against you, making you uncomfortable = an ally that stuns groups).\n\nWhile exploring, you may be presented with the opportunity to use different things from your inventory (this is almost always the better option than just "going for it"). For example, if you see a boiling pot of liquid, you can either try to scoop the liquid out with your bare hands (resulting in loss of health) or use a container item (ex: a potion or any other applicable item). The game does a good job of deciding what works and what doesn't, and this variety makes playing the game very, very surprising and fun.\n\nIf you like casual RPG play with comedic elements, give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!","August 2, 2014","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The choices were not open ended, leading either to instant death, progressing in some way, or devious later instant death when you missed something important on an earlier page. The progression was linear, and while it branched somewhat, the roads taken would crystallize into one or two endings, depending on the length and complexity of the adventure. As with any genre of book, game or book/game hybrid there were categories of both comedy, high adventure, gloomy dunkelkeit and of course some smut <3\nSome books in the genre were single quest deals leading the player down exotic locales or dark environments. Others came in sets that followed a linear progression between books, each new installment assuming you completed the earlier ones.\n\nThis game is very much the first cathegory of adventure book where the story is exotic, strange and stand-alone. The player faces off in space versus a cosmic monstrosity easily dominating them and taunting at their demise. In the nick of time the player is saved by three very strange aliens who introduces themselves as "dark scavengers"; looters of planetary energy, forever traveling and therefore always looting. As their newest member (and the only one who can fight) you are sent down to a nearby world where planetary energy can be harvested. This is where the game begins.\n\nThe game is divided into a series of levels that, in turn are divided into a set of "rooms", similar to an adventure book's pages. Each room has a couple of challenges for the player to attempt, yielding loot when successful and damage or other penalties when not. Items aquired can then be used to solve subsequent challenges, awarding the player with an ever larger array of solutions to problems.\nAnd what solutions they are! As for the first set of categories a CYOA could be mentioned to have this game is very much in the comedy section of things. Instances, combat, and even crafting your gear is all permeated with a stellar sense of humour that will have you staring at the screen in disbelief and glee. The world is interesting! The characters inhabiting it are funny! The comical timing is spot on! But aside from being witty, the game is above all else smart.\nNow how can I explain that..?\n\n*SEGMENT IS SLIGHT SPOILER OF GAME MECHANIC THAT IS FUN TO DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF*\nWell, for starters the game makes the best of its newfound tendency towards the game part of its Book/Game hybrid existance. Say for example that you face of against a bandit and combat ensues. Normally in an adventure game, and in some types of rpg's where the action keyword is absent from its genre title, combat would take place through the taking of turns, opponents slugging each other untill abilities come into play. So too here, but with a twist. Knowing the player can only experience the world through still images, items (used both for combat and environmental encounters) all react to the way a character looks. In his still picture, the bandit is jumping towards you with an axe in hand and with a crazy snarl on his face. In this case, the dentists drill will deal huge amounts of damage since his teeth show, the wind bag will stun him since he is up in the air, and the magnet will take his weapon, weakening him. Of course it would be silly to assume the bandit is always jumping in the air with his mouth open rendering him forever vulnerable to our very situational items. Lucky for us however the game figures its silly rules is better than realism it couldn't fake anyway :>\n*END SPOILER*\n\nLong, less spoilery story short; it plays around with genre conventions and mechanics as well as being genuinely humorous.\n\nDark Scavenger is one of those games where you would like to see more of the world and the characters that inhabits it, but somehow know that to experience them in any other way than this specific game's would somehow spoil the magic. The game never lets itself get old and is surprisingly varied both in terms of difficulty, encounter types and tone. It leaves itself open for an impossible sequel but still somehow feels complete, like an expensive meal where the only regret after finishing it is not being able to have it again.\n♥♥♥♥. that got kinda pretentious. I guess what im trying to say is that the game itself and the way it constructs its narrative and mechanics is in itself part of the joke, and trying to do it again would, as with all good jokes, leave sort of a hole of anti impact that would suck part of the punchline away.\nIts like nothing. Costs basically nothing as well, so don't take my word for it. If you felt even a little compelled to check it out after reading this or the opinion of others I would say go for it! It will have you entertained in that "ah good times" way where you remember it later with a smile.\n\nSountrack´s nice too. and FYI it is about 6 hours long.","December 16, 2015","true","10.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

More specifically, the gameplay and art direction. Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to buy the game myself and only bought it a few days ago upon discovering a location to buy steam cards.\n\nAfter finishing this game, I feel tempted to write a good review for it. Here's a few reasons why:\n\nUnique gameplay: The gameplay of this game is akin to a interactive book combined with a video game with the point and click exploration element added to the mixture. Basically, you click stuff, engage in battles and obtain loot. Loot can be used to craft special items and it also depends on the crafter you choose. Kamaho, the skeleton "warrior" will make weapons for you. Falsen, the green goblin looking guy will create wacky items for you and Gazer, the alien thing will summon or make allies for you. This adds quite a bit of replayability to the game (especially with the new game plus that allows you to keep all your items from your previous run). Choices that you make impact the game in small ways but never really diverge from the main linear plot line of the game. As such, making certain decisions may result in obtaining "extra loot" or just some extra details about the world you are exploring.\n\nPlot: The plot is kinda that a science fiction adventure. You are stranded in space after a battle with a mysterious creature called "Den" and wake up to find yourself in a spaceship with three aliens on board. The aliens request for your help in obtaining fuel to sustain the ship and you somehow find yourself accepting the quest. The rest of the game is just exploring the world to find the mentioned fuel.\n\nApart from that, the storytelling sometimes takes on a dark humour like tone (with Juno (some random person you meet twice or thrice) lying dead on the floor in the next area with no prior explanation.) which could be quite entertaining to read. Overall, the storytelling is splendidly done to resemble an actual storybook and I find myself having no faults with it.\n\nArt:\nThe artstyle is simply amazing. It resembles the artstyle of video games in the 1990s while also looking like a picture book. Keep in mind that my opinion about the artstyle is subjective as I really appreciate old school artystyles.\n\nMusic:\nThe music is quite fitting with the battle scenes and the game itself. Not much else to say about it really. (P.S.

The visuals is "take it or leave it" but the real stregnth is in it's writing, and characters. The humor is right on point, had a few genuine LOL moments, and it features a interesting dialog mechanic where it's possible to get out of some encounters through diplomatic means.\n\nOverall, if you are into unique and well written stories, strong characters, and don't care too much about polish dark scavenger is well worth the asking price. But if you are sensitive to presentation dark scavenger's debatable visual style might be a bit off putting.\n\nStrengths:\n- Great writing\n- Likable characters, even the villains\n- Genuine humor\n- An interesting concept\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Debatable presentation quality\n- A niche game, some will really like it, some will hate it","May 17, 2014","true","2.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I like the story. The artwork lent itself to the feel of the story (among other feelings I felt some nostalgic Heavy Metal-ish vibes from the art and story, sort of a post-apocalypse-or-pre-genesis-set-in-an-ambiguous-era sort of feel).\n\nThe interface is simplistic, which works very well for games like this IMO. I beat the entire game in almost eight hours, but I think I could probably squeeze another two or three out of it if I replayed it making different choices.\n\nI'm not mad I spent money on the game.

You basically run from room to room of each level, beating up enemies, clicking on environment objects, and navigating through chuckle-worthy dialogue, 'scavenging' interesting objects all the while. After each room, you will typically be brought back to your hub to make the scavenged pickings into either a weapon, item, or ally – this is the prize mechanic of the game, though it comes dangerously close to being a gimmick at times. Your crafting buddies give you no clear indication of what they'll make, and although there is certainly fun in this, you can't help but feel a bit cheated by this fairly unforgiving system when you realize that weapon you just made is practically useless.\n\nThing is, it's hard to take any of the game seriously: between the story, the crafting system, and the writing, it all just feels like the snack-size equivalent of a good time. You go through it and you enjoy it for what it is, but leave with an empty, half-satisfied feeling.\n\nWhy the hell have I devoted so many words to this five-dollar purchase? Just buy it if you're that ♥♥♥♥ing interested, look how far you've gotten in this review. It's five ♥♥♥♥in' bucks. You spend that much on footlong sub, minus tax, fatass. It's not that much. Go mow a couple lawns if you're so ♥♥♥♥in' money-conscious, Scrooge. Jesus. Just buy it. Buy it. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nHere, cutting point - if you like short, simple turn-based RPGs with decent, humorous writing and a charming appearance, buy it. If not, go somewhere else.","May 21, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"
