Its a great concept and is kind of fun, but leads to be boring after a short time. It can be funny and make you laugh but it can also just drag. After only 1.5 hours of playtime I am not sure I will play again until the next update. My 4 year old even got bored of it after a while. While I can certainly appreciate the open world sandbox experience, it doesnt feel like it is fully there as of yet. I'm certain there are things outside of the city to find, however its a drag if you flip your car upsidedown and are stuck out there trying to search on foot - you end up spending a very long time just walking back to find another car or even just walking to -- nowhere really. It feels empty and barron outside the city walls and there doesnt seem like there is really much to do inside the city either (except for fall down over and over).\n\nThe mechanics feel clunky as well which is another thing that was really aggrivating to me. Walk up a curb fall down, walk to a wall fall down, walk to a door fall down, walk to a car door - fall down, even walking to an object results in getting knocked to the ground. I'm not sure if this is how the physics are supposed to work or not at this point and being I never played the previous version I dont know much about the game, but constant ragdoll when trying to walk to a object or even a NPC is very annoying to me.\n\nI saw a bunch of stuff in the videos and update news but cant seem to find them in game. Rocket Launcher?? Where is it? Fly a blimp, uh how and where?? Just thinking that the game is not very intuitive on letting players know where things are at, I mean I know there are things to find outside the walls of the city, but who wants to drive for 10 minutes somewhere, flip the car upside down then have to walk for 20 minutes though empty fields to find a freakin boat because there is no way to flip the car back upright??\n\nAlso the game needs some background music, all you hear outside of radios in the area is the frogs feet slapping against the ground as you walk. While I give it a +1 for creative thinking there some ambient music would be nice - the silent slapping of the frogs feet I feel contributes to making it feel more bland.\n\nAll in all the experience so far is OK, not great/amazing and not totally awful. I am going to recommend this game to sucker more people that skim over this review into buying the game so that maybe they will give some ideas in the forum and help make the game better.\n\nPros:\n*Funny character\n*Large world\n*Great for kids (until they get bored too)\n*Developers are very active in the community\n*Sharks\n*A frog with a gun that can drive cars!!\n*Local coop is fun\n\nCons:\n*Lots of space without much to do\n*Clunky physics result in falling down alot\n*Not very intuitive - at least give me a hint on where I can go to find things to do\n*Wheres all the stuff from the videos??\n*Needs a music option\n*Lots of graphical glitches","October 17, 2015","true","32.7"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","37","43","7","6"

It seems dumb (and it is dumb), but the game is quite a bit of fun.\n\nEverything actually working is important for a few reasons. For one, you're not fighting the game's lack of functionality when trying to accomplish something; and more importantly, the game has more to it other than a cheap joke. After all, a functional game needs to be good since it can't just pass by on some "roflmao"s from the easily amused.\n\nThe game's developers (all two of them) are staying on top of updates too. Even if the updates are a bit infrequent due to the small team, the updates are very good. Every update so far has added at least  a little bit of new content, along with the usual tweaks and fixes.","March 24","true","6.2"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","29","31","6","0"

Many twists and turns, with a fabulous story, excellent customization, and ecstatic gameplay. I will now go through the 3 main things that make the game so special to me.\n\n1. Charecter Customization\n\nThis game features such detailed customization you couldn't tell the difference between me and my frog. Size, Hair color, arm length, toe curliness, hair waviness, neck density, favored cheese, and elbow pointiness are only a few features of this game. The charecter looks so much like me, my girlfriend started making out with the computer monitor, thinking it was me. And by girlfriend, I mean a digital copy of Amazing Frog?.\n\n2. Story\n\nI was reduced to tears by this game's enthralling story. It stars your frog, and his society of jugglers, Pablo, Keiran, Akbar, and Gustavo. Your frog has cancer and must tap dance his way to the top of the leaderboards, to be noticed by the great Hi-Lo, the esteemed drug lord, who also happened to be a giant Cheeze-It. On the way you meet Elga The Annihilator, your charecter's love interest, Gorf, your evil twin, and Gandalf, a wizard. With thousands of side missions and optional quests, the game never seems to have an end.\n\n3. Gameplay\n\nAmazing Frog has an amazing array of tricks up its sleeve, with things like a full skill tree, amazing 4K graphics, full Oculus Rift support, full Smell-a-vision support, the abilty to make you fly, and the power of friendship. This game runs esseptionally well on my Google Glasses.\n\nI would rank this game as followed:\n\nAmazing Frog? > My life's values > My Firstborn > My Welfare > All Social Contact > Eating > Sunlight > 10","November 29, 2014","true","14.0"," 73 of 107 people (68%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","68","73","107","67","4"

Not even at the level of the Ouya version, runs kinda badly, and doesn't have a lot of content. But! It's still a goofy sandbox with weird physics and unexplainable antics, local co-op, and weird secrets, which is exactly why anyone would buy this.\n\nThe genre is a recent breed of game that aims for social hilarity and player goal-set concepts. Amazing Frog? is actually enjoyable here as opposed to being animated gif fodder for the unfunny basements of the internet. The humor (mostly fart or "why is there a grill here" related) remains low-key, amusing throughout and the wacky nature of the game never distracts from the 3D platforming.\n\nThe PC version obviously needs a lot of tweaks to reach the level of its Ouya twin but I have no doubt that most will find the game not only fun now but holds the promise of more fun after support from the developer progresses.","November 26, 2014","true","1.8"," 48 of 69 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","48","69","4","0"

Many people have not gotten this game because they believed it to be a ripoff of another animal-sandbox involving a goat of some sort, but it is still in development, and not to mention online multiplayer is in development. Although there isn't a load of content to play with, I still had plenty of fun exploring the city. The enormous map adds plenty of replay-ability through exploration of the land outside the walls, and finding secrets. The devs are very active with the community, answering questions, and often releasing new content. This game exceeded my expectations, and I hope to see what else they'll come up with in future updates.","April 27, 2015","true","25.8"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

New stuff gets added every now and then. It will however probably be in Early Acces for quite some time.\n\nFun game that is all about messing around with the environment. Fun game to play with the kids. (not too small ones though. 5+ ages)\n\nThose who are into achievements can skip this one and get Goat Sim. Also those who have done everything in goat sim might need to take a closer look before buying. This game might not tickle them the right way as this is way way different than goat sim despite both being games that are about messing around.\n\nThose who really should buy this? couch players - Just 2 players messing around and trying to get into seemingly impossible places is fun. If however there is zero chance of any kind of local MP then one need to think again or wait for steep discounts. It is not bad going solo but the best fun is definitely local multiplayer.","April 9","true","12.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When the game enters a feature-complete state (final version), a detailed review will be posted.\n\n\nPros:\n- Great game to play with friends (up to 4 players)\n- Huge open-world map (about 20 sq.km)\n- To date, the best virtual rendition of Swindon\n- Unique concept\n- Variety of vehicles that will expand\n- Hard working and passionate developers\n- The physics of the game can provide you hours of laughter\n- Impressive for a game that's not yet finished\n- Loads of costumes and other collectables to find\n- Great community\n- Many references in the game of multiple community members and youtubers\n- Plenty of easter eggs and references\n- Many things to do, infinite possibilities of making your own games with friends\n- The only cons are things that will be fixed\n- They just keep adding stuff and improving the game\n\nCons:\n- Still retains some old textures from the OUYA version (will be replaced in future versions)\n- Physics can be very glitchy sometimes\n- No online support right now (but it will be implemented in the future)\n- Despite the huge map, there isn't much going on in most areas\n- At the moment, you will need a good computer to run Amazing Frog at normal FPS (will be optimized later)\n\nPros/Cons (depending on the player):\n- Royalty free music by Kevin MacLeod\n- High emphasis on toilet humor\n- Cartoonish graphics\n","April 8","true","59.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Still very buggy, slow, and it feels barren and quiet. Outside of Swindon, gameplay is dull and it takes forever to get nowhere. A pain to play and the longer I play the more I feel that I'm absolutely wasting my time. This game isn't worth more than $0.99 in its current state, and the final product'll be worth less than $5.

I think if you aren't interested in reporting bugs or aren't super excited to play this game you shouldn't buy it just yet, but I'd reccomend it absolutely when there's more content.","November 24, 2014","true","16.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

I am fine if the map stays like it is too) - online multiplayer (i think its beeing developed right?) -more easter eggs\n\nwell, if the developers read this then i wourld be VERY VERY VERY happy if you added the vehicles (espacialy the cars) to the game, i think the city is going to get bigger too soo.. that means more enterable buildings :D\n\nhope you liked my huge text xD\n\nalso: if you do make the cars i wourld have sme ideas on what you can base them on: supercar: lamborghini gallardo / bugatti veyron / ferrari f40 / pagani zonda cinque, buggy: volkswagen Beetle dune bug,  tuner car: toyota supra / mazda rx7 / mazda miata mx-5, muscle car: 1969 dodge charger / 1969 plymouth roadrunner / 1969 camaro SS, drift car (maybe?) RX7, taxi: ford crown victoria, police car: ford crown victoria / ford mustang, RV: just pic a RV xD, well, i dont think the cars will happan anyway, but if they happan this is what i wourld really love to see :D","April 4, 2015","true","9.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

The amount of enjoyment you will get out of it will depend a lot on how much you can provide your own entertainment. There are trampolines, vehicles, cannons, trampolines, ramps, and other objects strewn throughout the world. It's a playground of items with near-limitless potential.\n\nIn the transition from Ouya they've made the world MUCH larger and removed the odd pricing scheme for level access, opting for a flat rate. I think $15 is more than fair for the amount of time you'll get out of this discovering items, screwing around with friends, and having a good time. The game doesn't bring much to the table if you're playing alone; playing with at least one other person is best.\n\nMy few disappointments are the lack of availability for weapons (there were many more readily available in the Ouya version), and that the game no longer appears to outline where the other players are on the map. On the Ouya version you would see an outline of the other players wherever they were on the map. The settings menu is SLIGHTLY confusing because when you choose "Fantastic" for graphics it appears to accept but reflects "Fast" in the menu anyway. I'd chalk that up to a glitch.\n\nAll-told, it's GREAT fun for local co-op and I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to have a great couple hours with friends just messing around.","November 22, 2014","true","2.7"," 15 of 40 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","15","40","0","0"

You can play up to four player splitscreen which makes the game even better.\n\nWould I say this game was worth $15.99? Heck yeah!

YES.\n\nI seldom buy games in the same manner I bought this one, out of sheer curiosity and intrigue, and to be perfectly honest a part of me was certain I'd regret acquiring it, but boy was I wrong. 'Amazing Frog?' has been keeping me entertained for far more time than any AAA title has managed to entertain in a VERY long time.\n\nSo what makes it so special?\nThis is one of the most unique videogames I've ever had the pleasure of playing, not because it has jaw-dropping visuals, or a deep plot, or interesting characters. None of that. This masterpiece DOES NOT need those, because, as it stands, it is already a better title than numerous other games that decided to invest in those departments. Why? Because it's just FUN. The silliness of its mechanics, how ridiculous it is (I mean frogs with RPGs!), how much promise it shows... If there are indie titles out there worth buying this is definitely one of them.\n\nWithout a doubt one of the best acquisitions I've ever made, and I can barely what for what the next update brings!","January 1","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game when i think it was like really early access and now it has come a long ways. I like the graphics how they are cartoons and it just really fits the game. It can be a little tedious trying to get around the huge map but there is a lot of secrets in the game, and I think that Fayju has a few more tricks up their sleeves. Right now, you can find different costumes for your frog in the game, secret doors, and buttons as well. I don't want to spoil the game, so ill just say a little bit more about it. I think there is good and bad things about this game.\n\nGood:\nVery Intertaining\nMany things to discover\nNPCs actually kind of interact with you\nthere is cars and guns ;D\nThe map is HUGE\nand much more!\n\nBad:\nI find that the sharks get annoying after awhile\nthe map is big and it takes forever to get to place to place\nThe map could use some more towns and trees etc\n\nThats all from me, Enjoy Amazing Frog? :D\n","January 10","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendDari/recommended/332570/","LegendDari","Legend-Dari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendDari/","66 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOk, so I bought this game to play with my friends. It was really good. I enjoyed it... There are still a few flaws though.\nPersonally, if you're into GTA, Goat Simulator, Gang Beasts, and other Funny Physics based games I recommend giving this one a try. Amazing Frog is great, and I'm hoping the game gets better as it receives updates. I don't have much time to write a full review, so I'll write the pros and cons for now.\n\nPros:\n- Its really entertaining at first, especially if you/your friends didn't expect your frog to fart alot.\n- The PvP is ridiculous. My brother and I really liked it.\n- Finding new things is great, especially the Vault.\n- You can mix and match costumes for your frog.\n- Many Collectibles ranging from Kitties, TVs, Microscopes, Trophies, and costumes.\n- Great to play in short bursts and long 100+ minute sessions.\n- More features are coming soon, so I could expect that this game will get better.\n\nCons:\n- For some reason, the Mouse input likes to stutter alot in certain rooms.\n- A bit laggy. I'm complaining because this game does not really have the graphics of Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and the huge content filled world of GTAV. I expect something better from something so barren. I can understand the multiplayer lagging though.\n- It was a little easy (for me) to get the OUYA version mixed with the PC version. Its not bad, but I was hoping for the Party mode.","March 5","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've never played GTA V or any GTA games, this is a great substitute. I just love the style of it and just the down right weirdness of it all. The best part is that you are a frog, and just the ragdoll motions of everything and the interaction, is hilarious.\n\nGo to the Beach\n\nLook around\n\nSee Jet Ski\n\nHop on and speed out into the water\n\nSee Green Buoy and check it out\n\nNext thing I know, I'm dead\n\n10/10!

It's your standard goat sim with frogs, a little more content than goat sim like driving vehicles and using guns. Highly recomend this especially with friends.","January 9, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
