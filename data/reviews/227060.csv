I hope the developers see this. I want this game to be better. Don't pay full price, wait until its on special!!\n\nPro's/Interesting features/positives:\n\n- Unified strategic-tactical zoom. I like using the mouse wheel to get a bigger picture.\n- Capturing enemy troops and making them slaves, and getting them to work/produce resources.\n- Storyboard and voice acting of Caeser\n- History lessons, fun facts in the tool tip pop ups.\n- Supply system and logistics. Its interesting to have to factor in the constant need for food. If only this was done better.\n- Supply: Getting resources around the map, rather than a phantom stockpile like in AOE2.\n- Supply lines, and interrupting them.\n- Morale of troops and enemies, routing. Idea done very well in Rome2: Total War, but half done here.\n- Taking hostages and sending them to other towns to guarantee public order.\n- Building camps at strategic points is good idea, but these are poorly done.\n- Seiging concepts are good - starve them out, drop their morale to zero and they surrender, or reduce the fortifications and overwhelm. I understandthe concepts but these are not clearly presented.\n\nCons/Negatives/Feedback to Devs:\n\n-No multiplayer!\n- Confusion with the colour scheme. Zoomed in the Romans have green unit icons, but zoomed out, they are red figurines, and vice versa for the enemy/other factions. The faction colours are too similar.\n- There needs to be unique sounds to indicate an action happened. Unless you are closely watching everything in real time, the various drum beats mean nothing and blend in with the sound track.\n- There is no clear delineation between who is friend or foe until they start attacking you. There should be some colour system to indicate what your current diplomatic status is.\n- There is no clear indication of garrison or garrison strength. There is stacking under figurines on strategic map but these are not clear. Something better is needed, such as a flag.\n- "Camp" look fortified when built but are too easy to capture. There needs to be some visual cue that the camp is unguarded.\n- Supply lines are not clearly articulated. I want to hover mouse over line and see what the flow is, and what the rate of change is. I want to know the network, of where supplies are going, and how long to get there.\n- Diplomacy to way too simplistic. How is it can chose what treaty to have... can't the other side have a say?\n-How do I know the stats of an enemy asset? Wouldnt this be a mystery?\n- Faction flags are poorly done. These should clearly different from each other. Suggest and Icon.\nThe use of figurines in general is poorly done. Its like trying recreate a board game, The figurines lack detail, need more colour differentiation and better indication of what their strength is.\n- Zoomed in Icons are too similar/ not easy enough to distinguish between unit types. More details needed on icons.\n- Resource problems... all the time... starving troops... swarming enemy... undefended settlements... no guidance from the tutorial, or manual. Its poorly presented.\n- No visual cues on stockpiles of resources at a settlement.\n- The icons indicating no food, poor morale, not in supply line, whatever the lightening symbol is etcare not clearly explained. Need a sound cue on whats going on. If voice acting is used some variety in expressions would be needed to avoid repitition (We're hungry!" We haven't been paid!" I cant get my goods to market!" etc)\n- Needs clearer indication of when towns are requisitioned (rented!), who they are native to and that they are now under Roman control... otherwise it all looks Roman.\n- Requisitioning resources from allies means all workers in it disapear. Why can't I rent the resource and hire the workers too?\nThe panels are too big and say too little.\nThe figurines are too big and lack detail. Cities look the same zoomed out, but quite different zoomed in. Why do Gallic villages look like the Greek Acropolis??\nCombat system leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe I've been spoilt with RTW2... but seeing figures throwing javeline the wrong way in a seige is silly. No use of shield against missles.\n- Seeing slingers shoot through mountains to troops on a road on other side.\n- Castles look medieval... Gauls did not build such massive fortresses.\n- The range of units indication reticle is outrageously huge. A low key indication is needed.\n- Selecting units is too tricky. Suggest following conventions in other RTS.\n- Not enough detail in zoomed in unit icons. An inidcator bar on the left for something and on the right for something else would really help. This infor is on the unit detail panel but could better presented.\n- NSome features that could really improve gameplay: a technology system, unique resources,trade between factions, alliances where allies help, senate politics, disease/plague, civilians.\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you get this, your patience will be tried, the learning curve steep, and the lack of expected niceties/features very fustrating. So much potential but it fell short by too far.This ambitious game has features that remind me of a number of games:\n\n- Morale like Total War,\n- Food like Caeser 3,\n- Zoom out like Supreme Commander,\n- Empire building like Civilisation,\n- Resource and supply like Knights and Merchants (and Settlers),\n- Building forts in strategic locations like AOE2,\n- Capturing forts/cities by attrition like 7 Kingdoms\n- Seasons and day/night like Empire Earth,\n- City capture like Rise of Nations,\n- Fog of war and figurines like Shogun Total War...\n\n...but all of them did each of these concepts much much better, including games from 2001 (13 years ago) Its an ambitious game but it needs the budget and technical wizardry of the big gaming developer publishers. It especially needs sounds and visual cues, and to improve icon differentiation.\n\nOverall, 6/10. I'm glad I only bought this on a 75% off special. In its unrefined state, its not ready for full price. However if some changes were made, along with my feedback, this could be an excellent game. Don't pay full price. If you get it, prepare to be disapointed, but maybe you'll see the good side too. Its no-where near as good as the premium product of Rome 2 Total War, and is quite a different style of game, but it has some different features to keep you coming back.\n\nI hope the developers see this. I want this game to be better!","October 23, 2014","true","36.0"," 213 of 230 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","213","230","6","17"

A great strategy game that should have appeal to all levels of RTS players.\n\nI'd just add one thing though, Longbow's track record.

One of a small list of developers that do not send their games out in the wild and forget they exist beyond first week sales.\n\nCombine that with modding support built in from the go and we have here a game with potential to provide hundreds of hours of entertainment value for years to come.\n\nIf Total War: Rome 2 left a sour taste, this will go a long way towards scratching the Roman itch.","January 31, 2014","true","117.8"," 225 of 257 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","225","257","0","9"

Don't expect this to be a total war clone. A lot of reviewers compare this to that series, but it is not. Battles are part of the fun but it is not the main objective. Keeping your supply line, linking up your cities, and making sure you don't run out of gold is what makes the game challenging. The map is interactive and exploring in this game is fun to do. I highly recomended it for a historical and stratagy game alternative.","June 19, 2014","true","24.5"," 109 of 135 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","109","135","0","0"

This is a game that really satisfies the tactical,strategic and operational side of any strategy player.\n\nThe graphs are better than before and there is even a variety of faces amongst soldiers.\n\nThre are tons of civil nad military buildings that can be built and/or destroyd according to you strategy (i.e. bridges,forts)\n\nThere is a huge variety of units and each one of them has its pros and cons\n\nThe terrain is much more detailed and plays a much more importante role, you have to build bridges to cross certain rivers and certain mountain pass only allow for one of your units to fight at a time.\n\nThe interface needs a little work but its already 10x than the previous installment, requiring less clicks while not being dumbed down.\n\nI am also very happy to see that the developers really care about the community and it is open for suggestions, unlike the other guys(CA,SEGA). There is a MODS tab which suggests taht the game will be moddable, which needless to say, is an awesome feature.\n\nIn summary, do yourself a favor and buy this game.","February 12, 2014","true","19.4"," 110 of 145 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","110","145","0","1"

Most other reviewers seem to be firmly entrenched as die-hard supporters, or enraged that this isn't "Rome: Total War 3."\n\nPros:\n-Surprising historical accuracy. I alt-tabbed to check wikipedia a few times and was always pleasantly surprised. Hegemony: Rome does a great job of putting you in Caesar's sandals.\n\n-Fantastic, seamless zoom-out world map. The world map is intuitive and looks exceptionally well. A tastefully done "seamless zoom" has been promised by strategy games for years and this one actually delivers.\n\nCons:\n-General clumsiness in controlling units and the camera. Units also seem to alternate between odd rigidity and ending up locked in combat while seemingly doing nothing. The strange combat model ultimately makes it difficult to engage in the kind of tactical maneuvers you might expect from a game about Classical warfare.\n\n-Supply system that's heavy on micromanagement and light on strategic decisionmaking. The dilemmas and opportunity costs which should drive major decisions just don't exist here. Basically you're always trying to feed your legions in the field, and to do so you're required to individually create "worker" units, designate mines or fields for them to use, and then manually create supply routes to-and-from cities and outbuildings. There is also little UI in this regard - a list of trade routes sortable by destination/origin or some color coding options would help.\n\n\nOverall: 5/10. There appears to be no extra metagame choices offered by Hegemony: Rome's potentially interesting supply and resource systems. Instead we're left with a clumsy "Warcraft:Rome edition" that requires some mindless micromanagement on top of a stale combat system. I am looking forward to what extra patching and mods do to the game, but only the biggest strategy buffs should buy Hegemony: Rome in it's current state.","May 28, 2014","false","2.3"," 229 of 330 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","229","330","0","16"

A basic, rough little arcade RTS with some neat ideas. But despite its rough edges I ended up putting 110 hours into it because it was fun.\n\nSo imagine my delight at seeing Hegmoney rome on a bundle star sale. Ther latest game from the same devs, but with all the rough edges smoothed out. Wow was ever I mistaken in thinking that.\n\nIn fact this game is quite the opposite. The nice clean interface is gone, now its an eyesore of icons and walls of text boxes. The epic battles are gone, now you just end up with a mess of mobs brawling all over the place.  In fact its hard to find a mechanic they have not broken. The way my army eats, I can no longer put more than a hand full of units into the field as they end up starving to death. The econmy? No idea whats going on there as one minute I have hundreds of gold, the next I'm flat broke and my armies are rebelling.\n\nThey have added the ability to requisition/build camps etc and upgrade bases, but with the broken economy I never get the chance. Oh and they added a very basic diplomacy function. Woot.\n\nBut the real deal breaker is the bugs. They are the only legions you will find in this game. Units randomly vanishing (including Ceaser himself in one game), unit hot key assignments randomly change so you end up sending in the wrong uinits. Camera locking to the terrain forcing reloads, trigger points that don't trigger....and lag spikes and crashes. And often you need to click a unit multiple times before it will finally select, and often your units will not replensish as the game will give you the recruitment blocked message, even when there is nothing blocking it.\n\nSure the devs can find the time to create DLC, but not time to fix this mess. They can even find the time to start making an entire new game for a kickstarter - but still can't find the time to fix this broken mess.\n\nThe only pros I can think of, is the voice acting is generally good, and the music is also very fitting. Andf the mechanic to take hostages instead of having to garrison every town was nice.\n\nIf you want to see this game done right, then grab hegemony gold. Same devs (tho hard to believe) but none of the issues, crashes or broken mechanics, and a very good game with many hours of game time. If you want Rome then get one of the excellent total war series.\n\nLuckily it was part of a bundle so I ended up with some good games, A shame this was not one of them.","March 11, 2015","false","15.8"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","75","94","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/227060/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Hegemony's seamless tactical map is very much the series' trump card, and upon starting a campaign in the latest entry, Hegemony Rome: Rise of Caesar, it's immediately obvious why. Every single resource that you own, from the lowliest unit of captured slaves to your grandest city, is represented at ground level and as part of a strategic overview. Zoom out as far as possible and you can see all these points of interest as tokens on a parchment map spread across a desk in Caesar's war room. Which is great for an overall picture of your situation, but Hegemony cleverly mixes this omniscient strategic control with the ability to respond instantly to emerging threats on the front line.It's a clever system that avoids the clumsy disconnect between combat and a clunky tactical map that plagued Rome II. Here you've got total control, but also the smoothness of being able to respond instantly to developments on any scale. There's no stopping and starting, no waiting for loading screens or enemy turns. Just the grand plan.For a game about Julius Caesar, one of the pre-eminent battlefield geniuses of his day, it's a shame that Hegemony doesn't do the old ultraviolence particularly well. Expect very basic RTS fare, with most battles inevitably coming down to dry numbers rather than being decided by tactical trickery. The business of organising your force into an efficient formation is too clunky, lacking the clarity of, say, Total War's drag and drop approach.There's still a basic satisfaction to be found in massacring scores of the enemy with your elite troops, or crushing helpless infantry with a cavalry charge, but it's a much less cinematic and deep affair than I'd hoped for. I wasn't expecting Hollywood battles given the massive discrepancies in budget compared to similar war gaming titles, but a little more finesse wouldn't have gone amiss. To be fair, Hegemony isn't trying to ape the epic flourishes of Total War. While that series glories in the spectacle, the dust and blood and clash of war, Hegemony Rome is really a game about infrastructure and force organisation.The logistics and ruthless precision of a well-planned military campaign. The four-part campaign is designed to gently ease you into the game, teaching you the core systems one by one and slowly ramping up the stakes with each chapter. Based on Caesar's actual diaries of the Gaul campaign, it starts with his dismantling of the tribes at Bibracte and ends with his troops crossing the Rubicon back to Rome, taking you through various skirmishes, battles and periods of fortification and construction along the way.Once you’ve mastered the game's various intricacies via the campaign, you'll feel more comfortable diving in to the open sandbox mode, which puts you in charge of whatever faction you fancy and lets you decide for yourself how to conquer Gaul.Hegemony Rome’s quick, neat and easy approach to grand strategy puts impressive control in the player’s hands. The seamless and easy to navigate tactical map is a real strength, one that similar war games could do with taking note of. That said, despite commendable scope and some neat ideas, the meat and potatoes combat system and issues with the interface and AI decision-making slightly bog down the overall package.","December 25, 2014","true","52.9"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","51","61","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamscape/recommended/227060/","steamscape","nannerpuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamscape/","139 products in account","Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar is both a solid, fun game and a serious contender for the best 'Rome-based' RTS game in the last few years. Like the majority of others I consider the Total War: Rome franchise to be the benchmark for this genre, and despite the bugs and gameplay issues Rome II had, it got better after patching. The original Total War: Rome was fantastic regardless. It may not be fair to compare the two games considering this is technically an indie release, but I figure even newcomers to the RTS genre have heard of or played a Total War title and it's the most logical (and easiest) comparison.\n\nThat said, the devs here didn't try to mimick Total War by redesigning or borrowing its good parts. In fact this game is nothing like Total War. Rather, Longbow Game Studios changed the focus entirely by making historical accuracy and in-depth resource management the two biggest components of Hegemony, and it works very well on top of the standard RTS framework. Hegemony is also far less daunting than Rome and Rome II. Players new to strategy games can jump into the campaign mode and start playing immediately*, but there's also enough substance to keep veteran RTS gamers engaged. The graphics are passable and run smoothly on the highest settings, and the cutscenes are just that - static scenes drawn with a "comic book" style to them. It's a nice break from the bombardment of massively rendered 3D action scenes that end up cheesy and unrealistic because of bad anti-aliasing and direction. The comic book art is also very mature, and there is plenty of violence and blood, which is a nice touch as well.\n\nThat asterisk up there? It's for the biggest flaw in this game and (ironically) part of why this game is so easy to jump into: the tutorial system is lacking. You can jump right into this game as a new player and the tutorial will guide you, but you are going to have to learn a lot of the minute details by banging your head against the wall losing captured cities and dying often during the first couple hours. Even veteran RTS players will have to figure out some of the details by trial and error. The most glaring is the lack of explanation about hostages and captured city morale. After you understand it, it makes sense, but you will have to experiment a lot first. (Hint: move your hostages to far away cities. The game fails to mention that part.)\n\nOverall, this is a good game. Is it worth $30? Yeah, but probably only for Roman history fans and RTS fanboys in general. If you are brand new to RTS games you might want to wait until this goes on sale.\n\n\n[Update after a long, long break: They've patched it a few times and there's even a DLC out now, which shows me they do care about this game longterm. I'm about to play through again on Hard mode and am looking forward to it. If you read the early reviews about constant crashing, those issues seem to have vanished now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/golwar/recommended/227060/","golwar","Golwar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/golwar/","574 products in account","First off: I really enjoyed Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece. And that's part of the problem.\n\nHegemony Rome tries to achieve more in some aspects, for example city building. Sadly those new features are nothing compared to the loss of depth and functionality, as this game isn't the same kind of 'open world' game as its predecessor, with its ultimate freedom.\n\nI pretty much only played the very first mission of the campaign. There were 2 parts of preparation, and I chose to go west first and not south.\n\nMy choice triggered new tasks in the west and north, so I did those too. During a march that lead me very far north, I registered a lack of supplies and sent the majority of my troops back to the nearest city.\nWhat I didn't know: At the target I would have gained free supplies and I was expected to fight a huge battle there.\nResult: I wasted the triggered free food and naturally I lost the battle with my few units, that I did not send back. It was a disaster.\n\nAfterwards I went south beyond the Alps for more units, the second option from the tasks that I had been given at the beginning. So now I had sufficient troops, but what about food? As you might remember, food was the reason why I failed at the first place.\n\nSo I tried to prepare for another full march north, but I never managed to gain enough of supplies by a mile. And yes, I connected the frontier city with other cities and set its stock demand on high. Yet it never went above 150 food in stock, which isn't even closely enough. Or in other words, it was a deadlock.\n\nCompared to the open world in Greece, you are now confronted with triggers all over. You have to follow a deisgned path and if your decisions differ even slightly from the idea the developers had in mind, it might mean the final end of your ambitions. If that happens already during the very first mission, I can't imagine how painful it might become later.\n\nAdd many minor control and handling issues and you have a disappointing game.","June 24, 2015","false","3.4"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","34","49","0","2"

Also the frequent crashes many reviews mention(I had to set autosave to 5 minutes to avoid going insane) have been fixed in late October 2014, so consider this in your purchase evaluation.(!)\n\nHegemony Rome: the Rise of Caesar is the Successor of Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece which itself is sort of an Upgrade of Hegemony: Phillip of Macedon. All three Titles basically work the same so If you want to test the Game(or one of it's predecessors) any one of them(or a demo) will give you quite a good impression of what's going on.\n\nWhat's good about this game?\n1.) ... wait, you've read(or will read) other shorter/longer reviews, you saw the Trailer, you maybe even played Hegemony Gold. So I'm just going to skip this and go right to the bad things and you go figure out why I spent 100 Hours(jeez) on this game despite the bad points below, eventho I have like 200 other games in my steam account and a job that earns me enough money to buy said games ;)\n\nSo what's bad?\n1.) Unit variety. Gauls/Britons/Germans all have the same old: Skirmisher(guys with swords), Slinger, Javelineer, Spearman and Cavalry. Gauls also get Archers, Romans only get Legionaries(strongest unit). Some subfactions get some statbonuses but most factions are essencially the same. I liked the variation in Heg. Gold, where Macedon, Persia, Athens, Illyria, Sparta, Nomads, Thracians and gerneric Greeks all had different unit-sets. They are however working on this and enabeling modding, so I'm optimistic.\n2.) The AI, while not particualry stupid*, has significant limits pertaining to it's inability to grasp the game, it does not train veterans, it builds buildings seemingly at random, it does not manage it's food supply properly etc. on the other hand this makes taking enemy cities less time consuming^^.\n3.) The forum is dead. If you got a problem, just ask here on steam, it's more likely to attract the devs, or other players for that matter.\n4.) In the Campaign you command Kaisars Gallic Legions. A common quest reward are extra Legionary Cohor... Brigades. As you play a special Campaign faction(and not the regular Sandbox Romans) you cannot train them yourself, in turn you cannot disband them, sounds ok sofar. However, to replenish these troops(and your Uber Archer and Slingerunits) you need Roman Population. Now where would you find that? In roman cities. Now guess how many roman cities there are in Belgiu... Belgia. One. An average city can sustain 2-4 Brigades. In essence, unless you only use low morale Gallic troops you are going to spend most of your time waiting for your Capital to recover it's pop. yeesh. Having "culturechange" as a rare Questreward as in Heg. Gold would have prevented this.\n5.) Workers/slaves cannot carry Food. Players of Heg. Gold will know why this is a bad thing, you essencially need to plonk down expensive camps everywhere so your troops don't die of starvation during a siege. That, or you upgrade your troops carry capactiy instead of Attack/Morale/Hitpoints/LOS/men per unit, and who wants that?\n6.) the Campaign ends with good old Cheese-R explaining his righteous struggle against the Senate and then whining a bit about his death. Something I find quite a remarkable thing to do for a corpse. Then again I find most non-rotting-related things quite remarkable if done by dead people. Also with the (horrible) intro movie showing him lead his legions over the Rubicon I would have at least expected a cliffhanger hinting to a sequel where he fights against the Senate, that or an optimistic but mysterious ending that incites young people to look up what happend to him on wikipedia just to discover his grim fate, that would have been neat, and cheaper.\n\n\n*it's actually pretty mean :(","November 24, 2014","true","131.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"

Your units need to be in supply range of fort or city with land connection to their home city to be able to draw recruits to replace casualties (further from home city, slower the reinfoircements. You can change unit's home city, but (probably) only within other cities of the same tribe.\nBig part of the game is unit experience, which is what will keep you playing mostly.\nYou are member of particular civilization and tribe. Your native cities are loyal, but any conquered cities need either garrison buildings, garrison, and/or hostages put somewhere else to prevent it from rebelling (don't worry it's not too complex and you don't need to pay constant attention to it). Conquering another nation can mean getting their wood, gold and food sources, their recruitment pool, but depending on their bonuses you get access to units with combat bonus of their native faction or terrain capability of that faction, or even to different unit types (if you conquer roman city as barbarian, you get access to roman legionaires, which have very different stats).\nThere are some differences between nations/tribes, some have larger number of native cities, others have some bonuses (meelee/ranged combat bonus, terrain-specific unit capability on recruitment).\nAmount of unit types is not huge - skirmishers, spearmen, slingers, cavalry, javelinmen, archers for barbarians, additional infantry and cavalry of roman factions. After earning experience in battle (or small amount on recruitment with some building upgrades build) you can (and should) spend this on purchasing officers for that unit, up to four (non-detachable) officers of four levels plus (detachable) general. These can provide significant bonuses to offensive and defensive capabilities of unit, morale, logistics, terrain-passage, siege, scouting, and probably more bonuses(typically you'll want combat bonuses first for meelee units, ranged bonus for ranged units). Generals work same as officers, but can be detached and moved to another unit or to govern some city (not sure about effects of that, maybe is still work in progress).\nThere is lot of content in the game already, and game is very good, although there are still things to be done (AI is good in handling some tasks but not so good with others). Good news is that developers are working actively on the game, and judging from support history from original Hegemony game (which was focused on Greece) they can be trusted to do so for years and years to come.\nCompared to original Hegemony, there is less variation in units, because it takes place largely in homogenic area of Gaul.","November 15, 2014","true","67.8"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","20","26","4","0"

If you do not know what I am talking about, give it a try. But if you want a game packed with action and excitement then you might be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, these things are still happening if you let them. You can pause at any time and play the game at your own very pace.\n\nIt is still an unfinished game, so expect technical and gameplay issues; most importantly, read the "Known Issues" list in the main menu. The time you are beyond these problems the game turns out to be a lot of fun. You jump into Gaul as it is conquered by Cesar (a.k.a you). Mainly you focus on conquering and dealing with the threats the local tribes are representing, but you also have to keep you economy running. Otherwise your troops will not have enough to eat and receives serious penalties. That's about it, but you can do things a few different ways already.\n\nThe tutorial is decent enough to tell you how you play, although some mechanics I did not understand up to a few hours into the game.\n\nOverall I just can recommend this game to players of strategy games, both realtime and turn-based.

Keeping your units and cities provisioned through an extensive network of supply lines is crucial, and using natural borders of forests, mountains and rivers is important to maintain the safety of that very same network.\nConstruct camps and bridges as resupply points or defenses. Take hostages to ensure the obedience of your subdued enemies. Keep your army in good morale. Promote officers and assign generals. Definitely don't get stuck in the Alps during winter, unless you want your troops to get snowed in and starve (I speak from experience :( ).\n\nRather than focusing on just the battle itself, Hegemony Rome puts you in charge of ALL the decisions that a commander (such as Caesar) would have had to make whilst campaigning. All this on a truly gigantic map of Gaul (and some bits of Northern Italy, Southern Britain, Belgium and Switzerland) representing every major historic tribe and geographic feature.\n\nThe game remains intuitive and attractive, however. Despite its scale, it remains overviewable through some rather unique design (zooming out from individual soldiers on terrain to miniatures on a parchment map).\nIt also is absolutely unparalelled in its attention to historical detail, every city, faction and unit has a small in-game article of historical information that can be read. You could quite feasibly substitute this game for reading information on the Gallic Wars online.\n\nHegemony Rome is quite different from any other strategy game out there. it is incredibly educative and detailed, while the basic game mechanics remain quite simple (though very different from other strategy games).\n\nIf you are interested in history, and a detailed, accurate portrayal of what campaigning is like, this is the game for you.","December 12, 2014","true","115.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

Although without a dought the best battle simulation games on the market are the total war series. The properly consider weather wind, moral, flanking supprise, shock terrain etc. But while the total war series is great for battles it is not much for simulating wars.\n\nGone are the days where every battle can be won by overwealming a tiny kingdom. Gone are the days were you can march troops without a consern of supply. The hegemony series simulates war campaigns. Trust me ensuring troops are properly supplied can be a task, as the enemy is always trying to mess with your supplies.\n\nUnlike in most RTS games the player will not win by overwelming an opponent the will by flanking them on a grand scale.\n\nThe game gives some nods to tactical battles, but the terrain tends to be too crowded to preform them properly. Everything in the world feels squashed together at times. Effects that would effect a grand compaign such as weather are not present.\n\nThe game is lacking multiplayer.

It wasn't optimized then so I let it sit for a while. It is now decently polished, and optimized.\n\nThe Hegemony series is in antithesis of the dominant form of RTS (Starcraft Style). It is a slow playing ballet that builds over hours where a handful of units can have a large impact and a single raid can cause problems for an unwary empire. The way supply and manpower are handled in this series is brilliant, creating a very thoughtful style of gameplay that I would love to see more often.\n\nThe bigger your empire, the more difficult it is to protect it, and manage getting the needed food and manpower to the right place.\n\nThe four story campaigns follow the career of Caesar in Gaul in exacting detail. You will invade Britain, you will cross the Rhine, and you will see your province torn apart by rebellion. By the end of it you will feel like you have conquered the place yourself, and maybe feel a little shell shocked at having to deal with pesky raiders constantly picking at your flanks.\n\nThe game is by no means perfect. If you are not a patient gamer, or a thoughtful exploiter of gaming systems you may not enjoy it. The scope of the game might have been a little too ambitious for such a small studio, and it occasionally falls apart. It is slow to start, but that humble beginning only lets you appreciate the epic scope once you get there.\n\nPros\n-Supply lines and manpower mechanics define how the game is played. Raids can be devastating, and concentrating an entire army in one place will often cause you to lose as you run out of food or your empire is picked apart by raiders.\n-New Experience System lets you specialize Legions, and even promote officers from veteran legions to lead others.\n-Flanking and positioning make an enormous difference.\n-You can built forts and bridges, and customize cities.\n\nTake it or Leave it\n-Siege warfare is brutal. Better plan it out.\n-Naval Warfare can be finicky\n-Not a lot of different varities of unit, however the differences become very meaningful as you learn how to use them,\n\nCons\n-Slow to start\n-The supply mechanic is not for every gamer\n-Not as flashy as a AAA title\n\nI will let it sit for a while longer then I'll try the sandbox campaign and some mods I think, then update my review.

But it is surprisingly engrossing, with a slow-moving pace and almost hypnotic game play. There is a lot of emphasis on resources, the combat is ok but a bit dumbed down, and diplomacy seems almost non-existent. That said it is pretty satisfying to grow your empire. Game play seems to come down to gradually expanding your empire while avoiding over-extending, and very limited resources make every decision more difficult. Should you beef up your city defences or build a few new units? Invest in city buildings to build new unit types like Cavalry or invest in a marketplace to generate more income? There are lots of ways to play –raid enemy farms for resources, steal slaves from enemy posts, ambush enemy units etc, starve the enemy into submission etc.   The AI is pretty good, with the enemy launching attacks on your weak spots and retreating in the face of superior forces. There is a full fog of war so you never really know what is happening outside your territory.\n\nAfter playing the same sandbox scenario (as one of the Brittanic tribes) for some 30+ hours, and still being a long way from completion, I would have to say the game is starting to get a little predictable and formulaic. Position and strengthen your forces, capture enemy positions such as farms and mines, capture an enemy city, suppress revolt, recover from your losses, repeat and thus slowly grow your empire. That said it has been absorbing getting to this point, and the game has some nice touches - I can’t quite stop playing... yet.\n\nIf you are a fan of Total War, Civilisation etc and this is on special offer then I would recommend it.\n\nTips for new players: expand your realm slowly. The AI will hit you hard if you over-extend. Ships tend to sink in the winter months (put them in a city until spring). Upgrade cities to have the marketplace – cash is king in this game and is usually the main limiting factor to expansion. Capture enemy farms etc and send any remaining slaves back home to man your own farms etc. Capture enemy units and enslave the survivors. Captured slaves can be sent to a city and disbanded, adding to your own population to replenish your forces. If you lose a  unit, it is sent back to its home city where it will replenish. Mercenary units are useful, but do not replenish.\n","December 18, 2014","true","39.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

I would only recommend this game if you are into the history of Caesar. Don't get me wrong, it is a fun to play game, but has some drawbacks.\n\n-The game can be sluggish. You might want to reduce the graphics settings to get a smoother experience.\n\n-For one, the price is too high for this version of the game. I think too many improvements are needed to make it worth the price really.\n\n-The game is CLUMSY! at first. It deff. takes some getting used to. The zooming in and out of the map is nice, but it doesn't always transition very well. Clicking on units and cities take a lil precision with the mouse as well.\n\n-The tutaorial sux. It doesn't always guide you as to exactly what you need to do next. The little window that pops up explaining things (as in Total War series) kinda gets in the way of some info. Not sure how to close the window.\n\n-Graphics are ok, although somewhat dated.\n\n-Combat is very simple when compared to the Total War series. Although this is not always a bad thing.\n\nHas some nice features you do not see in other games. The integration of battle and campaign are done very well. Both are tied together on the same map... and things happen in real time. For example... while one of your legions is in desperate battle with enemy raiders, you can send more troops up from a different part of the map to help, or to engage another enemy. In otherwords... LOTS IS GOING ON AT ONCE!\n\nMy advice if you get this game, TAKE YOUR TIME at first.

I thought I was going to be playing a poor mans version of total war, but to be very frank with you it's a lot better than a total war game and simplified beautifully.  Ok the battles are not as visually stunning as total war and lack detailed unit management, but its not really a skirmish battle simulator.  This game is all about supply and logistics management and they have got it spot on.\n\nThe AI is beautiful and attacks you in weak areas or cuts into supply lines if you fail to defend routes or knock out uprisings.  Every small victory on the map is hugely penile stimulating, however small victories can back fire if mis-managed.\n\nAll I can say is buy this game and whip your slaves into shape for the love of Caesar and thy Gods.","February 22, 2015","true","64.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","10","13","4","0"

Are you looking for a visually stunning, history sim-style RTS?\nWas that yes?\nYou’ve found the right game, get the Early Access now, and add your mark on the games design process, before it’s too late!\n\nLIKES:\nI’ll keep this short and simple:\nGraphics – STUNNING… the willow trees look like willow trees, need I say more?\nSound – Does the job, not going blow you away, but better than a budget title by far!\nMechanics – These are unique in my opinion, to this game, but the tutorial really helps you out here. Try not to get ahead of yourself; if you don’t then you’ll be rewarded at the right time for the right things. OH! and the ZOOMIE CAM! Oh how I love this game mechanic, your able to zoom right out from the battle field and you’ll actually be able to control the game from a map that’s based on a table, assumingly Caesars battle map in this tent/base, really well done here!\nfun? – draws you in, first of all with visuals but then by the historical facts it starts sharing with you along with a gameplay that is unique to itself, and finally by the pure attention to detail.\n\nDISLIKES:\nAfraid to say it, but games these days almost always have something to complain about, and that’s the UI. As its Early Access, then I hope this fixes.\nOh you evil space consuming UI, thou art so frustratingly annoying!\nWhy does thee need a map when thee has a speedy scrolling map thingy…. Bla bla bla\nYeah it’s a real shame, it suffocates you like those moments when a cat sticks its tail right in your face! The game is so well visually designed, so much so that I would really start being absorbed into the game and feel like I was a real general overlooking the battlefield, but I can’t help but notice the UI.\nSuffice to say I could go on for a while. I understand that someone has sat down and worked hard at creating this, so I appreciate that. However they want feedback and if this was improved it really would improve emersion, visual appeal and overall quality.\n\nOVERALL:\nAs you can see there is only one thing that really bothers me about this title, and I hope in some ways that helps you decide what you are looking for, as the game is damn good, certainly playable (unlike most Early access titles) and a damn good educational journey into the past.\nIf you love games of this style/genre, you will not be disappointed!\n\nAPPROVED!\nTrust","February 25, 2014","true","6.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

I am a Roman enthisiast and play literally every game to do with Ancient History but more importantly than that, I have played their predeccesor that was based on the Ancient Greeks (More importantly Philip II of MAcedon) I have spent hours on their games and I understand that this game will take so much time to complete considering they are such a small company but overall I am impressed with what they have achieved so far and I am grateful they have given us early access to the game.\n\nFor those who compare it with Rome II, I dismiss their reviews instantly as it is and always has been a completely different game. In addition, although this game has a few bugs and still needs a lot of improvement (I constantly get a CTD at a certain point in CHapter 1) I am completely confident that this company will sort these bugs out and sort out their tactical maneuvering (They have mastered that in their previous game, therefore, they will in subsequent updates of this game.)\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the story mode they have included within this game which is something new but apart from that, they still allow you to deviate from the 'main story line' and conquer at will (though quite restrictive in this early access.). What's more is that they have added a load of new features such as upgrading cities and units. To be honest, I was struck by the amount of upgrades they have actually included within the game! (I was only expecting a couple throughout).\n\nI understand people, especially people like me, who want complete historical accuracy in their Ancient games but in this game I take an acceptance of the fact that although their units are not a complete comparison to what they were in actual real life, these units are fun to play with.\n\nI haven't got far into this game as it does not allow you to go that far but in conclusion, I am confident that this fairly good game will become a really really good game within time. I believe their next step would be to sort out all the current bugs that are within the game and go from there.\n\nIf I am honest, if you want a complete game that allows you to play all the features I would not recommend this game, nor any early access game as you will be dissapointed, but if you are like me and have had experience with this company (Who do actualyl listen to your opinions!) and their games then I would definitely recommend it!\n\nPS - The campaign map looks excellent, the updated graphics are a bonus but they have made the map lok more 'filled' with all the new workers they have populating the area. I am also grateful for giving us a tremendous amount of cash! I cannot wait to start the real game in all its entirety!\n\nPSS - Sorry for this long unstructured review which probably will not help anyone.

The Hegemony series has so far shown to be deeper than most zerg-rush RTS games. It forces the player to think tactically about more than just the troops being thrown at an enemy. I have to constantly evaluate my situation on multiple levels in order to triumph. This is not brought about from complex micromanagement systems, as seen in ot6her titles. It is simply an organic result of focusing on the main aspects of building an empire such as knowing an enemies strengths and weeknesses, dealing with supply issues, and utilizing the available resources wisely. Taken all together, Longbow games have made long lasting RTS games that continue to challenge and satisfy far beyond what I have found in other titles. How well historical fact is woven into the game only adds to my enjoyment. If you are still not convinced, I strongly reccomend trying the free demo for Hegemony Gold to get a taste of the franchise.","March 11, 2014","true","32.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

A lot of the complaints I've seen from others are true, but they don't bother me.  I'd describe the game as a cross between Total War and Starcraft, and that is true in that it has RTS and strategic aspects, but that really doesn't do the game justice.   It's just massive.  I'm 9 hours into a campaign, and I'm about 25% finished.\n\nThings I love:\n\n1. The realistic complexity:  Walking your army through a small area without many farms may very well eat all their food and cause them to revolt.  Everything in the game has a cost/benefit, and the game designers clearly went to a great deal of effort to make the game feel authentic.\n\n2. It's addictive:  I find myself playing for 5 hours and still wanting to "just finish this one thing".\n\n3. The single player campaign:  It basically follows Caesar's accounts of his wars in Gaul.  If you've read his memoirs, you know the entire campaign because it pretty much follows it to the letter.  I was annoyed with the final fight with Vercingetorix.  I was expecting  massive attacks from all sides, but there was just a large army sent out from the city which I locked up in a choke point and took out with my archers with zero losses.\n\n4. The seemless transition between the strategic and tactical map.  No other game I've played has ever tried this.  They've truly pushed the genre on this one.  It took a while to get the hang of it, but it works very well.  Sometimes, it works too well.  Imagine trying to fight 4 "Total War" fights simultaneously.  This happens and it can be annoying.  On the other hand, this is only happening because I'm pushing 3 armies up through Gaul at the same time while they are also attacking my flank.  That's awesome.\n\nComplaints about the game:\n\n1.  It's too easy.  Granted, I've been playing these games forever, so I'm good, but after your troops get upgraded, they just roflstomp any opponents.  This is partly because the computer doesnt attack smartly and partly because the computer upgrades its units stupidly.  The computer is, however, persistant, and if you don't cover your flanks, for both your army and your cities, you will be punished.  The first hour of a map is difficult with limited resources.  After that, I've got so much gold, food, and wood that I don't even bother to optimize my cities.\n\n2.  Balance.  This is always difficult to do, and I realize that.  Getting experience for your archers is a pain, but once fully upgraded, archers with anything in front of them to tank just annihilate any opponent in about 2 seconds.  In fact, you really don't need anything tanking for your archers.  It's only a little helpful when you're in a 2v10 fight.\n\n3.  Crashes.  My games crash about once ever 3 hours.  However, Total War also crashes about once every 3 hours.  I just save a lot.\n\nAll in all, I've played for 60 hours and I'm not ready to quit.    It's addictive, fun, and interesting.","February 3, 2015","true","62.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has an awesome concept and executes it okay. It really lacks contents like unit variety (though you can pay rather expensive DLCs for that), it has a too simplified economy that hurts it and the AI is just incredibly bad. That there is no Multiplayer, does not better the situation.\n\nBut its a fun game, the main problem is you've learned everything in about 20seconds and you will beat it at the most possible difficulty on your first try with only minor problems.\n\nTL;DR buy it when its price has been slashed and you are looking for casual, easy, short fun","December 18, 2014","true","11.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

With that said I am not going to go into bugs, control issues and the like as this might be improved later. I will however go into my issue with gameplay as I was experiencing the same annoyance with Hegemony: Ancient Wars of Greece.\n\nWhat really annoys me is the amount of management the game requires. You need to manage food, supply lines, upkeep, expansion and battles. All in all these things are fine, but it gets so unbelievable frustrating when you have to deal with random raids from EVERYWHERE. You are trying to manage all these things and woop, you got three raids going in three seperate corners of your empire where you didn't have any forces. To make it more annoying, in the campaign you can sometimes be raided by someone who is outside of the campaign borders (the borders limit how far you can move) and you can't do anything to stop it.\n\nWhat makes raids even more annoying is that they can build bridges and they build them really fast. Before you know it you have a raid group crossing over and burning farms making the management of food even MORE annoying. When I play this game, I find myself pretty much jumping back and forth micromanaging supplies, raids, and other stuff while gradually making 1 inch progress every half hour. As the gameplay stands now I find it far to frustrating to be able to enjoy it (this is only in regards to the core mechanics of the game and has nothing to do with bugs and glitches as they will surely be fixed by repair).\n\nI wouldn't recommend anyone to play it in its current form, though the game has potential. As far as the game being frustrating, that might just not be me having patience enough for the game. I would wish for the developers to dial down the raids and random apperance of the raids across the board as currently it's just frustrating and not enjoyable.\n\nEdit: I have to say the concept of the game is really fun however and if they dial down some on the frustration I would actually recommend the game. I read somewhere that they might ease up some on the raids and I think a change like that would even out the frustration. Therefore I think I would reommend the game as long as you have the patience and head for all the micro and macro managing.","April 18, 2014","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It was difficult to figure out some things because the tutorial... well... isn't much help.\n\nThe battle animations are, frankly.. HORRIBLE. If you zoom in on a battle, most of the units are walking around like zombies... occasionally you will see one swing a sword or something. Good grief.. fix this please. It is just stupid looking!!\n\nThey need to add the ability to cycle thru your units (like Civ) instead of having to hunt them down all the time to check up on them (if there is a way, I haven't discovered it yet).\n\nThe UI is WAY TOO BIG! Make it scalable, please! If you have a few windows open, they take up half the screen!\n\nSince the game was just recently released, I hope some of the rough edges get smoothed out, and locating all your units becomes a bit easier.\n\nThese complaints are not stopping me from enjoying the game, but it would make the game more enjoyable and immersive.

A tutorial would be super helpful as they kinda just throw you into the game and tell you how to do a few basic things. Now let me justify the 5.5/10. For me personally a 10/10 game in this genre are games like Heroes of might and magic II & III, and to say this is anywhere near this is an insult. HR - Rise of Caesar is missing things like a skirmish mode where theres a random map generation and the objective is to beat everyone else on the map, and you know what? It might have it but because of the zero guidance found within the game I have yet to find it. it's also missing that "oomph factor" it doesn't leave you pumped after you play it. You close the screen look at the clock and go "really? I wasted that much time? I didn't even accomplish anything in the game!" The zoom out to map feature is really cool and well done but it just doesn't make up for the rest of the game. Am I mad I bought it? Absolutely not, I got it on sale and for what I paid (I think it was like 80% off?) it was money welll spent. Full price though would have left me dissapointed and angry I spend the money.

There are lots of good features. But then there are the bad ones, and they are frustrating enough to break the game for me. The supply lines for instance. And your so called allies will do nothing at all. Not even defend their own territory from raiders. So you'll have to hunt down every raider with cavalry. Though cavalry isn't strong enough to beat the unit, so you'll have to have a melee unit to beat the raiders, and then the cavalry to hunt them down. Unless they outrun the cavalry of course, which is a very real possibility. Then they'll just run outside the part of the map you are allowed to play on, reform and return later.\n\nYou can also set an autopause when a raider is spotted. But that could be while they are standing idle outside the area you can go to, and the next notification you'll get is that they've CAPTURED a camp, not entered your area or attacked your camp. And then your supply lines are tattered, which of course is logical and a nice feature, but each time you set up the supply lines it feels like a very unneeded micromanagement. Some raiders will continuously enter your area near a city. So I built some walls and battlements and put a unit of archers in the city. Now the raiders will run to the city and then stand their while my archers pick them off one by one, then flee back to their territory, reform and repeat.\n\nHonestly, allies are the biggest problem I have with supply lines as well as I'm losing a majority of my goods when I transport stuff through their lands. And no, there is no possibility to break the alliance and annex their lands. And the description of the supply lines are that they go one way only for some unknown reason. Each line costs some gold to maintain, and each fort (which makes supply lines easier to manage) costs some gold as well. And even though everything is connected and you have a good surplus you can still get food shortages, and I don't know why or how to fix it. Well, remove some troops of course, but then you fix the symptoms and not the cause.\n\nCombat is too fast to become really interesting. You could flank the enemy with your cavalry, but oftenly it takes too long time and your legions will have won the day before the cavalry arrives. Even though I got the DLC, combat is fast, short, easy and boring.\n\nThis is a lot of complaints, for a game that I think is pretty fun. It's just that it has/had the potential to be great. Upgrade system, town management and the zoomable map are all wonderful, but overall, I would not recommend this game.

The battle action may not fun look beatiful like rome totalwar but it also tactical. The game need you to monitor all of your move. Manage the supplier this is quiet fun. But some how i'm still don't understand reiformenct system which is need to go at some town but some town cannot or may be because it campaing\n\nI recommend this game to all o my friend as it fun. Another best rome game after i disaapoint from rome total war 2. This game is the game you must have if you love rome total war 2","March 3, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I simply wouldn't recommend this game because the field isn't balanced.  The enemy will almost ways win one on one and you have to outnumber them.  If you are going up against one unit you need two.  For two units you need three units, despite them being experienced or not.  If you face six units you need at least eight or nine and the field becomes too tight for them to manuever properly.  Cities will rebellion against you even if you have hostages and five units which you will lose and having a 100% moral.  After all that i simply just didn't like the resource gathering.  I think it suppose to be realistic but it just doesn't work in making the game fun and allowing events to flow.  Money too is odd and what is up with sailing units?  Couldn't figure out why they immediately take damage as soon as they are on the water?

While most sequels abandon their first game like a sinking ship and completely rebuild it from scratch or go nowhere with it like it lost the map, this game does neither.

The seamless map where strategic and tactical layers are fused together with smooth zooming that makes the gameplay quite enjoyable. In comparison to the old game its a lot easier to get income to support your troops since now you can build buildings and other city improvement where as before that was more dependent on the mines. Markets are essential for income. Walls are also a necessity. Forts nicely increase the supply radious so that you can expand faster then before and sustain your troops which is very authentic for roman times. Officer upgrades are also quite nice although maybe not as intuitive as one would expect.\n\nSmall tip for people who don't know how to get food/wood/gold supply going. Capture a farm/mine/logging camp with troops or workers (slaves can't capture buildings - you capture the farm by left clicking on worker/troops and right clicking on farm) and then send slaves or workers in the farm/mine/logging camp (right click on farm). Left click on farm/mine/logging camp after you captured it and right click on city and voila your supply line is set up. The same applies for city to city supply lines (left select city + right click on the city you wan't to connect to). Its as easy as possible.\n\nThe AI really depends on what kind of game you wan't to play and how you set it up in sandbox settings - don't just choose random. Playing as a roman faction (2 of them in sandbox) there is no certainty that you will win cause you have a legionary army. You have to flank the enemy and as such bring their morale down. Ah, morale one of the most important factors in this game. Watch out for food supplies when you attack or your troops will have low morale and break fast and then you will have problems getting more troops since your troops are dead and it takes time to get more recruited like in reality.\n\nOne important feature of the game that needs to be used a lot in later game is active pause so that you can move your armies and assault different enemy cities, forts, etc. Afterall this is an rts game.\n\nPeople complaining about lack of diplomacy options - its the time of constant betrayal and warfare so its really not necessary to have sofisticated options especially since you sustain your economy yourself if you know what you are doing. Graphics - not really important to me as long the gameplay is good and I think that graphics that are in this game on a map of such grand scale (several times bigger then Rome 2 map) are quite good.\n\nDoes the game have issues? Yes, there are several instances where crashes or some glitches occur but they are not very common and game breaking (autosave is implemented). At this point I still recommend saving as many times as you can. I know the company for a long time and I know that if there are issues in the game they will be patched out and the game improved but only if people send them dump files that they can actually find the issues !!!\nIt took a long time for Hegemony Phillip of Macedon to become Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece and it had similar issues that Hegemony Rome has but were patched out at the end. Basically they are like Arcen games when it comes to improving and fixing their games.\n\nWhat I like about this game are interesting, realistic formation battles, city improvements that make game more user friendly in comparison to Hegemony Gold and realistic morale and supply system in comparison to other games in RTS genre where you have your armies magically march through the whole map without any supplies and without any morale issues.\n\nAs famous idiom by Napoleon Bonaparte says: "An army marches on its stomach."\n\nJust one more thing if you are expecting Rome Total War game from this - its not a Total War game so don't expect something like that or you will be dissapointed - its an RTS game of never before seen scale so it might be too much for a lot of players. I would still recommend the game at full price and over Rome 2 Total War at any time.","December 22, 2014","true","77.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's an attractive game with a wonderful map, some decent strategic options, a good basis for gameplay (it's a wonderful time period for war games) and has nice music. They did a great job with the historical setting and it has a complex recruitment/supply system that can take some time to master. There are a lot of things going for Hegemony Rome.\n\nIt's also an exercise in futility and frustration.\n\nThe logistics/supply system isn't well explained at all beyond how to link a city forward. There's no explanation of why this is important, how to do it well, how to link cities together and so forth. Building and promotions haven't been explained at all and I have no idea what they are. Needless to say, there's a learning curve with scant few resources from which to learn.\n\nI can get by that. I can't get by some of the gameplay. For instance, the second scenario requires you to take on 18 enemy units from Germany. There's no way my units can do this - they fold instantly and the TBS mechanics are awful so it's just a massive mob. Unlike the Total War games, this is just mob warfare.\n\nThe real issue is trying to keep even half that many units in supply while raiders continually raid from areas of the map I'm not allowed to enter (and no, you can't station a unit at the entry point because there's no supply there), I've had one city mysteriously taken over by bandits TWICE with 2 of my units in the city and never any pop up that told me I was even being attacked.\n\nThose are all fundamental gameplay issues that have no business being in a final product. In one scenario we get balance issues, gameplay issues, UI issues...all rolled into one mess. Trying to untangle some of this might be possible but there's not even a manual. So about those concepts that aren't explained? You're screwed.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the three crashes I encountered playing this battle.\n\nCome on, devs. You could have had a good product here. But you've got to do the polishing that's required. That means polishing the balance, providing the documentation needed by the player and fixing the bugs (rather than releasing new DLC).","August 17, 2014","false","6.3"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

I bought the game based on the amazing gameplay and design of the previous game Hegemony: Gold. Hegemony: Rome however, since the release had many issues, including performance, pathfinding, formation and GUI. I did not like to review it in negative way until I see what the developers can do about those issue, and as today I can say it can be consider as a very good strategy game just like Hegemony: Gold.\nThe basic design of Hegemony series is very creative and original, and for me it is the best historic RTS you can find on steam currently, it has the best supply system, seamless zoom and siege mechanism.\nFor Hegemony: Rome specifically they added many great feature to the basic design of the Hegemony series, but did not change the basic formula extensively, for example the building and the upgrading of your city/ fort, the camps, and the bridges, plus the DLC of mercenary and ambush system.\nThe only problem remains with Rome currently is the formation control, as it is not as good as the previous game yet, another issue is the terrains are very small, so big open field battles rarely happen.\nI would like to add that Longbow games are currently developing a new Hegemony game, taking into consideration the above issues.\nIf you are new to Hegemony games, please download the DEMO of the Hegemony: Gold first, if you like it get this one.\nI totally recommend this game for any historic strategy games' fan.","April 25, 2015","true","21.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Maybe I just have a crappy graphics card and i DO have it on low settings. Either way, the game is fun.

There are too many scroll-activated menus in my opinion. Some of the UI is very smart, such as the town UI. I think repositionable windows such as a full-fledged units window, where you could select legions individualy and have the camera redirected to them, would fix lots of clutter and improve the flow of gameplay.\n\nFor the time being, I'm going to wait for more updates, until the game becomes more playable.

It’s a slightly upgraded version of 2003's Praetorian's by Pyro Studios.\n\nIt boasts to be a refreshing change....with "immersive history." What you are get instead is:\n- Voice acting text boxes of dialog between generals) vaguely discussing the plot and movements.\n- 9 cookie cutter/inaccurate combat units, and 3 "siege" units, my favorite are ballista's and siege towers. Ballista's are built with siege equipment, but cannot be fired at cities, and siege towers which hold no troops, nor do any units graphically interact with them (they just sit there and give a bonus).\n- Graphically boring CIV IV environment\n-A storyline on rails with no chance of deviation or free will\n- Ridiculously boring, stupid, and predicable AI. An example of this is the games spawning of barbarians from inaccessible points on the map with almost stop-watch regularity....even though you have built a watchtower/camp defended with archers at their travel path that slaughter them instantly. The AI never stops, but you can’t NOT build it...because the barbarians will harass you supply lines. So it’s just a pointless stalemate.\n\nI could continue...but there is no point. There is a reason the trailer just has good music and "cool" roman monologue...because that’s the intro to the game...and it’s all downhill from there.\n","August 31, 2014","false","8.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Gather wood/gold/food, capture areas, and create a rather limited type of army types. (Very limited at that, approx 4 types of units per nation).\nI stopped playing this game once I found out that I coujld only make 4 types of units, and needed to conquer 95 percent of the map still.\n","October 26, 2014","false","6.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

I'm happy I didn't pay the asking price it wanted $32.99 and happy I waited. I'm starting too find a lot of indie games just don't measure up to what they say they show gamers. Hegemony is really boring and very linear game play. Its just click and attack and the side effect of having no food or wood after having twenty cities just do a cheat and your good too go. The campaign is deceiving when you want to play as Caesar too conquer your neighbours beside you and you will run out of food and resources. What's strange is you may have two hundred of each resource but building implementation goes on a hold.\n\nYou can run threw the campaign as Caesar and ignore everything else around you to end game.

For a 32inch 1080p monitor I kind of expect a little more leg-room buts its all taken up with these boxes.\n\nSecondly the mouse scrolling is not very friendly.  I'm used to games with a static scroll rate, and find myself pushing my cursor way past the sides, which the game interprets as 'I want to scroll FASTER!!!'  Pretty annoying.\n\nA wider field of view would be helpful.\n\nNeeds some extra work on the AI.  One of my legion units split up somehow and one side got attacked which made them all rally, even though they were a good distance apart.\n\nAlso finding my attack/move orders are often denied because of inaccessible terrain.  Like if I click on a cliff face the units will deny my order.  Would be better if they went to the closest point possible instead of just rejecting the order.\n\nI'm going to say no to recommending this game, only because its just not ready, no-where near ready (and the developers told me to be critical).

The game play is heavily based around seamlessly scrolling and zooming the map so this is a major problem. (It's not my pc, I can run Rome 2 Total War and Fallout 4 on their highest settings with no problems).\n\nIn between crashes and frame rate problems I think it's a good game. The little I was able to play was fun and challenging with some interesting mechanics. But it's not good enough to put up with the problems.\n\nAlso, the dev has released Hegemony 3 which I gather fixes the problems in Hegemony Rome. That's not nice.\n","December 31, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a great concept that advertised looks awesome. The real experience though is something different. The clunky controls and lack of functionality take away from the game a good deal. Once you get a feel for the game (which is pretty basic) the game is repetitive and honestly boring to play. It's buggy, will randomly crash and underdeveloped.","August 21, 2015","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Possibly another few months and this game should be buyable for its price, but at the moment, I only recommend you buy unless you at least  played hegemony greece demo (its only a few Mb) and your interested in the era and new controls which differ from rome 2 ofc\n\n9/10\n\nAlso for starters, play as the purple britannic tribe on the sandbox mode. It is the easiest in my opinion.","July 4, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
