Many of those projects fail but this time we got awesome and cheap platformer that offers a lot of fun and challenge for the price of five euros.\n\nPros:- Randomly generated levels. Even though you'll learn most of the level patterns, you will still be seeing something new.\n- It's a challenge. You might think it's easy but that's just first levels. The difficulty gets high and the level patterns are evil, especially if combined.\n- You can use bombs to make your own path through the level. You can blow up almost any block in any level. Hard part? No problem, bomb is your good friend.\n- Many modes. Daily runs, weekly runs, sandbox, coin mode,...\n- You can get lost. Later levels are huge and the game generates many dead ends. Note: Dead ends may also contain deadly traps. Or the way towards the dead end. Or any other way.\n- Graphics are pretty, you unlock color palettes (for levels) through your game progress.\n- Level editor. For those who doesn't like generated levels and want to show their level design skill.\n- It's cheap. You won't get broke, so... just get through!\n\nCons:- This game supports gamepads, though the bomb throwing is definitely made with focus on keyboard and mouse controls.\n- There are some terrible dark level graphic packs where you can't see much, this makes you weakened against people that would use other graphic packs (for high score leaderboards). This fact discourages you from using the feature of randomly changing graphics style after every level, which would be otherwise great.","December 28, 2015","true","8.4"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","23","28","2","2"

At first it's just sawblades and spikes, then turrets, wall-mounted shotguns, little death robots that patrol back and forth along the floor, etc..  After that?  I'm not sure.  It gets pretty challenging after a while, and I'm not good enough yet.\n\nTo help you along the way, you have an arsenal of dynamite sticks that you can throw to destroy parts of the level and the traps.  You can also choose an upgrade every few levels to increase your health, dynamite capacity, jumping height, wall grip, etc.  You will also occasionally find chests that unlock new color palates to make the game look more colorful and interesting.\n\nJumping can be a little frustrating, since the game will only let you jump off a wall once before you need to jump off a different wall to keep going up.  It's a design choice and I respect that, but it's a bit hard to get used to at first.  I also have a couple of small issues regarding gamepad play, but the Dev has already said that he'll work on resolving that.. so it's alright.  I still give the game a recommendation.  For $5 it's worth it for me.","January 30, 2015","true","1.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Nice basic features. Explosive terrain, perks all based on the basic gameplay yet each varied enough to stay interesting. Choose one from three [randomly rolled to choose from] each time you choose.\n\nYou can play nice and fast or good and slow. Varied traps and good controls [very light complaints and I put controls #1 on games that are above decent.] Incredible replay unless you just plain don't like the game. Daily runs if you feel like boosting the competitive aspect.\n\nReally a good pure platformer. Blow up terrain, watch out for traps, stay alive until you die.\n\nBasics: Get to the portal each level, anyway you can or want. Each time the level gets harder/different. After [2-3?] levels you pick a perk from a pool of three chosen at random.\n\nMore TNT? Slower wall slide? More HP? Faster movement? Faster movement gain faster? TNT explosion on impact? More TNT totals? I'm sure there are more.\n\nNo enemies I know of, so the traps while have their own [certainly not easy at all!] danger, it has a depth of certainty so dying is quite often your own fault. Though again, not easy since you need to react if you fall and need to dodge or move fast. Perks help and you can/must use all your advantages.\n\nComplaints: I think Four choices should be given from perks. Not to make it easier but to make the random levels a bit more balanced with more abilities to choose one from. Sometimes you just can't go on because you die from not knowing the next level will require more of what you don't have.\n\nAlso, the traps could use more umph and maybe a touch of Super Meat Boy's meatiness/blood. Some also just are unfairly unthreatening so you die unfairly not knowing how or when you'll die from something. [One trap looks like a rock outcropping but it kills you on contact?!]\n\nThere's more but overall the game is very good and focused, could use refining and more punch-to-the-gut impact with the danger/traps or double edged perks that are really good and really bad at the same time.","October 9, 2015","true","3.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/338190/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","Just Get Through is an addicting platformer with some dungeon crawling & roguelite elements. Armed only with sticks of dynamite, you must progress further and further into randomly generated dungeons with deadly traps that become harder and harder to evade. As you complete levels, you level up as well, gaining perks that help you be a better dungeon crawler. The entire game is literally a procedural death labyrinth.\n\nThe game has a great difficulty curve, starting with extremely easy levels and transitioning smoothly to more complex environments. It offers a good amount of challenge for players of all skill levels. The controls are tight and the procedural generation creates unique environments to traverse.There's even a level creator where you can build your own dungeons for other players to try, and you can compare your rankings/scores daily.\n\nWith the addition of huge patches like Update 1.2, Retrific has added a vast amount of content to a simple game. There are new unlockable challenge modes, like Night and Coin that add different styles of gameplay, and daily runs that challenge players to play to the very best of their ability. The amount of content added would have justified a paid DLC, but instead, the developer opted to add it all for free. All of this makes the game one of the best platformers available to buy on Steam.\n\nThe main issues with the game just come from a VERY repetitive soundtrack and pixel graphics that may turn off some people. Sometimes the generation can produce near-impossible jumps or traps that some would even call unfair, but they are not always that frequent. Sometimes the amount of content the game generates lags the game enough to mess with vital jumps and maneuvers. The developer is very active, especially on the forums, and regularly updates with bugfixes and tweaks as well as some content. Although it can be played with a keyboard and mouse, it's definitely best suited to a controller. This game is incredibly fun, and it's a shame that it doesn't have a bigger player base. All in all, it's definitely worth (more) the $5.00 asking price.\n\nTL;DR: For fans of Spelunky, Limbo, Electronic Super Joy, Super Meat Boy, and other punishing platform games.","March 1, 2015","true","16.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/recommended/338190/","zazzzel","陳先生","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/","287 products in account","Overview\nJust Get Through is a procedurally generated platformer that features a man attempting to exit an underground maze littered with obstacles such as spikes, guns and axes that will try to kill you.  Players utilize bombs, wall-jumping and wall-destroying tactics to move forward through the 50 level challenge by reaching the end point of each stage. Scoring is determined by number of levels completed, time taken to complete those levels, the amount of explosives used and the amount remaining when the game ends.\n\nJust Get Through markets itself as a procedurally generated platformer.  Essentially, this means that each level layout is generated through an algorithm with a randomly changing instance variable instead of being manually mapped out.  This results in a unique, user-specific level layout for every player who starts up a new game.  Upon completion of a level, a certain degree of difficulty is added to the next iteration of level design, ultimately resulting in a difficulty-scaling, randomized platformer.\n\nThe Good\nA good procedurally generated platformer will usually bring about three major points in terms of design.  In order of importance: the level must have a solution, must become increasingly difficult at a reasonable rate, and should be captivating enough to keep player attention.  Just Get Through manages to implement all three elements to a satisfying degree.\n\nIn terms of feasibility of design, each level should have a possible solution.  Given that the player does not destroy the map that is.  Just Get Through’s unique destroyable terrain mechanic in a platformer means that every decision the user makes will have an adverse effect on the pathing and solution to a level.  Every level does have a clear cut path to the finish line, but is usually littered with plenty of hazards requiring navigation of pixel-perfect jumps.  That route is usually the fastest, but comes with the greatest risk.  Users can choose to run that route for a higher score or excavate their way through a simpler solution.\n\nIn terms of scaling difficulty, Just Get Through delivers through a variety of obstacles including spikes, traps, buzz-saws, pixel-perfect jumps, level length; the list is endless but they all do the same thing: they kill you.  The first 20 levels is an introductory to game mechanics where the basics are introduced to the player.  The next 30 are where the game really picks up in difficulty and are really meant to test your skills.  New obstacles are introduced and alternate paths that provide the option of an extra life or bomb are given to the user if they so choose to take the risk.\n\nJust Get Through also manages an effective design scheme that manages to keep the player interested.  The implementation of wall-jumps implies fast-paced movement and split second decision making.  Running through a tight squeeze with buzz-saws, axes and shotguns feels rewarding.  Character upgrades every two levels provides a roguelike experience that can completely alter the playstyle and pacing of the game by giving you more utility, survivability, or speed.\n\nThere are also different game modes available in the game, with the classic, the timed run and the daily run.  The classic is the core game with the randomized map, the timed run is a fixed seed, generating the same levels every time for everyone, and the daily run is a ‘one-run-a-day-but-same-for-everyone’ type of style.  This gives players an option of how they want to play the game, whether they are casual or competitive gamer.\n\nAnother feature of the game is a level editor.  The level editor features real-time testing, so map makers can test their map while they build.  Once complete, you can publish your level online to let other people play your map.\n\nThe Bad\nThe controls are less than ideal and sometimes feels unresponsive, especially while wall-jumping.  Users who come in expecting Prince of Persia or even Assassin’s Creed style of wall scaling will not have a good time.  Explosives can sometimes be frustrating to use because it may blow up terrain in such a fashion that the level is no longer possible.  Without a ‘reset level’ button, this essentially means your run is over.  The color scheme and art style is also not optimal.  Yes, you can get colour pallets to change from black and white to something more appealing to the eyes, but it does nothing to aid in the differentiation between pop-up spikes, checkpoint flags and blades of grass.  In order to play safely, I often found myself stopping a good two to three seconds to see if anything pops up from the ground; which completely breaks the rhythm of the game.\n\nThe custom maps made by people are similar to what you would find in Mario Maker.  A few gems in a sea of ♥♥♥♥. Some of the maps are completely dysfunctional, featuring an exit point floating in mid-air with no surfaces anywhere near it.  Though the game does a pretty good job at detecting maps without end-points, the logic is not fool-proof and physically impossible maps do get published.\n\nOverall Score\nI personally don’t care about the level editor and avoid the custom maps because I feel the randomly generated ones are better in terms of playability and accessibility.  If I wanted a custom map to speedrun, I would just play the classic seeded version.  That being said, the basic game itself is addicting and is fun to play if you have about thirty or so minutes, so I give Just Get Through a 7/10.\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways please visit  Steamified [www.steamified.com].

It's a good time all around as while you do run into occassionally easy segments due to the randomization element, you will get the challenge ramped up over time as you use the resources such as TNT to your disposal to get through the various traps that run across. Overall, it's a great game to play quickly now and again to get an adreline rush of sorts, it's not the type of game that you'll play for hours at a time, but will enjoy it here and there. And for 5 bucks, there's a reasonable bang for buck here.\n\n+:\n-Variety in level design keeps things rather fresh over time.\n-Good mix up of roguelike elements and choices.\n-The ability to manipulate the environment adds a whole new level to the platforming, to make choices on what traps to take on and what not to take on.\n-In general, controls are great.\n-Variety in enemies is appropriate as it introduces new enemies and challenges in a timely matter as you go along.\n\n-:\n-Sometimes, randomization elements make a level ridiculously easy.\n-Thing the game would have done a little better going without the two color system. At times, it can be a real strain on the eyes.\n-Leaderboards seem pointless due to the randomization element, in particular with the levels.\n\nFor More First Impressions and Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziSeCQSFnq4","April 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/338190/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Just Get Through lives in this strange space between Spelunky and Super Meat Boy, a procedural platformer with loads of traps and tools to overcome them, that also gives you remarkable speed and freedom of movement. It's strange because it's not a space I'm sure that needs to be filled, because JGT has less depth than the former and less challenge than the latter. What it does have are a mess of modes to delve into, enough to keep you busy for a good long while.\n\nThere's no story or hook to the game, just you in endless deadly caverns, searching for the swirling exit. You'll run into just about every unpleasant trap you can imagine, from spinning sawblades to swinging axes, scattering shotguns to grinding chainsaws, rolling boulders to bleeping mines. To get through them, your spry little fellow can run, wall jump, and chuck TNT to blow up problematic parts of the level. The first handful of levels are mostly empty halls but into the double-digits you'll start facing intense gauntlets of traps that require significant patience and precision.\n\nEvery few levels you can choose an upgrade from an assortment of three, earning you boons like more lives or TNT, higher jumps, quicker sprints, or some key abilities like immunity to your own TNT or extra wall jumps. There are also different upgrades in the game's many different modes to help with the pertinent challenges. There's a Night Mode where you navigate with flares, a Coin Mode where you aim to collect as many coins as you can, and a Speed Mode where you start with tons of mobility upgrades but only one life. With nine modes in all, along with a database of user-created levels, you won't run out of traps to splatter yourself on.\n\nAnd yet, I found myself a bit torn on Just Get Through. The platforming is responsive and challenging, the modes offer a wide range of challenges, there are extra palettes to unlock... all the pieces are there for a great roguelike platformer, but I'd by lying if I said nothing was missing. There's a certain thinness to the game, perhaps from the lack of progression, or plot, or level features. Spelunky is defined largely by the crazy antics you can stir up, and Super Meat Boy has an incredible variety of levels and challenges, and Just Get Through doesn't really come close to either of those hooks.\n\nIn the end, Just Get Through is the very definition of a good game, without poking an inch past into great game territory. The platforming is solid and there's a nigh-infinite amount of it on tap. There's just nothing beyond that to make it something special. I can certainly recommend it if you enjoy the look or the feel, but there's always going to be something better out there.","February 24","true","1.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Action game Just Get Through. Just Get Through was released on Steam on January 30, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Retrific.\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hBlJq4d1-Vg\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nGreat fun to be had here for under $5. Highly replayable. 4/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThis is a great little indie game that may have slipped by you last year. Just Get Through me is kind of an interesting little game. It's tons of fun, has plenty of game modes and can become heavily addictive! The randomly generated levels are fun enough on their own, just trying to get through (as the title suggests). You plot your way through the course and avoid the traps to get to the other side. You even have dynamite to help blast away traps/walls. There is also a Daily Run, that is the same for everyone and you can compare high scores both globally and across friends. Chart your runs, your high scores, and have a blast. The graphics have a fun retro feeel (you can even unlock different color schemes!), the gameplay is simple and fun (and controller supported too!). This is a great little gem that may have passed you by in 2015. It's already a great deal at under $5, and in the upcoming Steam sale this could be one of the better bargains. 4/5, worth it for sure.\n\nHappy Gaming!","December 21, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

No learning intricate patterns. Plenty of crazy random death traps!\nI love the feeling of just flying by the seat of my pants, dodging between spikes and shotguns and razor shap pendulums.\nThis game has me making all sorts of noises as I get surprised by the chain reaction that killed me, or as I get so close to the exit only to be hit in the back by an arrow, or as I realise my TNT explosion just made it even harder to finish the level.\nSeriously, my wife always asks if I'm OK while I'm playing this game, to which I respond, "It's just THAT game again." ;)\n\nCharming art. I love the way the little guys big hair bobs around as you run.\nAll the different colour schemes keep it looking interesting and give you something to collect too.\n\nAs for the limited use TNT weapon.... I first thought it was almost cheating, but it has grown on me and it's more like a tool to make some painfully hard bits, still painfully hard, but passable if you're good. Also it's not necessary to use it to get through, entirely up to the player.\n\nAlso love the perks you choose from every few levels. Helps you get through, but also lets you experiment with different ways to play the game. Do you wanna try to collect heaps of extra lives, or use TNT to blast through everything, or jump higher and run faster?????\n\nOh yeah, it has a level editor too. So you can download handcrafted death traps if you prefer that style of thing. Or make your own death traps for your beloved friends to become infuriated with.\n\nAnyway, totally worth the price tag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/338190/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Just Get Through is a 2D platformer that has you playing through randomly generated levels until your demise. The goal of each level is to reach a portal to traverse to the next level. Every few levels you are treated to a perk which can be as simple as more lives or extra spawn protection time to not taking damage from your TNT. Which is a rather cool feature since this game features destructible environments and parts of the land will collapse if it has taken enough damage.  TNT can be used to simply blast a hole right to the portal and can be used to destroy hazards. It can be very dangerous to use if you don't plan and just destroy the level willy nilly since it is possible to get stuck and end your ruin so a bit of pre-planning is advised.\n\nVisuals are really basic and nothing special. It starts off in black and white but you can find more colors hidden in chests while playing. A cool feature but it would have been much easier to have been able to change colors in game instead of having to quit your current run to change it. Music is neither bad nor good, its just there.  There is no story or anything like that, just cool little messages scattered around by the developer. It is definitively the type of game you come for the gameplay and it is pretty good in this game as luck would have it. Every level looks the same only with different layouts and hazard placements.  They start off small but the more levels you complete the bigger they become and end up having multiple pathways with dead ends which makes it a lot more fun than just going from point A to  point B all the time.\n\nWe play as a small slightly chubby guy sporting an Elvis haircut. He is very agile and can jump with ease. We start off with 10 lives and 10 sticks of TNT and are able to regain them  by exploring the levels. After a few levels we are able to increase the item limit by choosing a perk. There is no real form of attack other than throwing TNT so most of the time we will just be dodging the hazards. These hazards include spikes popping out of the ground, rigged shotguns, saw blades, swinging guillotines and all matter of other nasty stuff. There are check points thrown about the level but not all of them will benefit you as you may spawn next to a deadly trap or simply much further from the objective then when you started the level so it's not wise to activate each checkpoint you run into. As I've mentioned the levels are randomly generated but they also allow you to create and share levels of your own which adds even more content.\n\nIf you are into platformers this is a very good one to try out. It's not something you will likely be playing for hours on end but is a go to kind of game when you have a bit of time to kill. There are times that you may be out of luck if you ran out of TNT and there are rather nasty hazard placements but other than that the random generation works very well. Leaderboards are in the game and are compared by how many levels you gone through before dying though you have the option to disable leaderboards entirely. A very simple game to pick up but it will quickly offer you a great challenge and soon enough you will be dodging shotgun shells and jumping for dear life. Overall I'd say it was a  impressive first game by a new studio and would wholeheartedly recommend it.","February 12, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The steam record holder has only made it to level 63, but I can only make it to level 34. At first the game looks drab in black in white, but Just Get Through features multiple color pallets that you can unlock by playing through the game.\n\nIt also features several unique and gamechanging modes, such as night mode, hardcore mode, speedrun mode, classic run, seeded run, and a few others. It also has fully featured level editor where you can create custom levels to share with your friends.. The devs, Retrific games, are still regularly updating the game. I thoroughly enjoyed doing this review, and I hope you enjoy the game.\n\nThat being said, as in my video review, I request that the right analog trigger emulate the mouse for throwing dynamite while playing on a gamepad.\n\nThank you Retrific for this game, and you did an awesome job making the game shine.","July 27, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The steam record holder has only made it to level 63, but I can only make it to level 34. At first the game looks drab in black in white, but Just Get Through features multiple color pallets that you can unlock by playing through the game.\n\nIt also features several unique and gamechanging modes, such as night mode, hardcore mode, speedrun mode, classic run, seeded run, and a few others. It also has fully featured level editor where you can create custom levels to share with your friends.. The devs, Retrific games, are still regularly updating the game. I thoroughly enjoyed doing this review, and I hope you enjoy the game.\n\nThat being said, as in my video review, I request that the right analog trigger emulate the mouse for throwing dynamite while playing on a gamepad.\n\nThank you Retrific for this game, and you did an awesome job making the game shine.","July 27, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fun precision platformer full of tricks and traps with randomly generated, fully destructable levels. Light character-progression offers a diet rogue-lite meal. Includes a level editor and in-game level browser full of clever user-generated content. Daily and weekend runs. Lots of game modes that offer a twist for everybody. Steam leaderboard support, tight responsive controls, and thrilling gameplay.\n\nThe BadSome of the collectible palletes in the game are downright ugly. I wish there was a way in-game to see what palette is in use and disable it from the rotation without guessing from the endless pages in the main menu. Finding "broken" palettes (ugh). There is little 'push' for the player beyond competing against your own scores or on leaderboards, so you must be score-driven to get the most out of this arcade platformer beyond a certain point.\n\nThe EndWall-jump and blast your way through treacherous traps and roaming robots in a series of procedurally generated, fully destructable platforming dungeons.

I review each title in six different categories.  Gameplay, Graphics, Immersion, Random, Replayability, and Sound.  I then take the scores of each category and average them to come up with the overall review.  You can watch the video attached for a full description, but here are the bullet points.\n\nGameplay:   The only real complaint I have here is the odd control scheme chosen for the level designer.  There are far better ways to layout the controls for that section of the game.  Otherwise the controls were on par and required no tutorial for me to pick up and play easily.  I love the nature of the procedurally generated levels that progressively get harder as you play.\n\nGraphics:  The colors make this game very difficult on the eyes at times.  The grey starting color palette is horrible and after an hour of gameplay I have only unlocked two color palette's.  Neither of which were upgrades over the grey starting palette.\n\nImmersion:  I didn't lay awake at night thinking about this game like others I have played.  I found this game to be a good stress reliever, but it did not suck me in and make me care about my character in any way.  I just start over when he dies with no real emotion attachment.  I expected that from this game though.\n\nRandom:  The random element was how addicting the game is.  Again, I did not lay awake at night thinking about this game and I have not had a strong desire to play the title.  It is a great way to kill a few minutes in between meetings, but not something that will cause a divorce.\n\nReplayability:  This game has an amazing score for replayability.  The procedurally generated levels make this game different every time you play.  Throw in the fact that there are literally hundreds or thousands of community generated levels makes this game replayable to no ends.\n\nSound:  The sound was on par.  There are a few annoying sound loops that happen when there is a moving object like a rock rolling or a bot moving, but overall the sound was on par with this type of game.\n\nYou'll have to watch the video for my official score in each category, but overall I gave this a 3.6 out of 5 with the potential to reach a 4.0 with a few minor fixes and tweaks.\n\nOfficial Video Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Ojazfsr1s","January 6","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The controls for the most part are responsive and tight but there's a few issues that pop up that result in what feel like very cheap deaths. For one, when holding the dash button, sometimes walljumps will drop and whoosh back to the floor with you (or spikes, if those are under you). Even more grating is... uhh, that jumping off wall grates doesn't work half the time, thus WHOOPS you landed right on the thing you were trying to avoid because no jump for you.\n\nThe level generation also isn't quite there yet... the game's able to never provide a truly impossible scenario (I think) but unrealistically unreasonable scenarios can pop up and usually the only solution is to TNT your way through rather than try to deal with the likely death caused by attempting one of these scenarios. The levels don't tend to have much of a smooth difficulty curve because most of the time you'll die on a level with one of these scenarios multiple times without dying much on the levels immediately before or after it. The levels also get a bit stale after a while, there's not much variety to be found.\n\nI dunno, I like this kind of game in theory but it really needs a high level of polish to be enjoyable and it just quite isn't there yet for me.
