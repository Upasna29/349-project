"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vonadi/recommended/13240/","Vonadi","\/onadi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vonadi/","119 products in account","One of the "Founding Fathers" Of PC FPS. Hell, maybe all FPS, it's so damn good. Facing Worlds is a reknown map to most gamers, and there's a reason for it.\nLet's get down to the basics of gameplay, what does it NEED to be a good game?\nScroll to the bottom for final verdict!\n\nGraphics - This game is old. 1999 old. That's really ♥♥♥♥ing old. And yet... I still find some of these textures pleasing to the eye. The color scheme works well, and the environmental effects on some maps are pretty decent, for when this game was released, these graphics were revolutionary, just like Half-Life's. Some of the skins for characters even look pretty cool. The only issue I have with the graphics is that if you're trapped in a small box, like an elevator, it gets REALLY confusing.\n\nCombat - HAHAHAHAHA, Wow, if there's one thing you CAN'T insult about Unreal Tournament without being a complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥, it's the COMBAT. I.... I've never played a game that can replicate how intense Unreal's combat is, aside from Counter-Strike. And it's a slightly different style, so even i'm not sure if CS can apply to compete with Unreal.\nLike I said, it is INTENSE. Even with easy bots, EVERYTHING moves at hyperspeed. Not just that, but things actually take a few seconds to kill. You have to take your shots wisely, and quickly. Most any weapon in the game will give your opponent the chance to turn around and fire back. Rocket Launcher, Sniper, and if you can manage it, Impact Hammers are the only exception. Maybe the flak cannon, but you have to get lucky with the spread. It isn't Call of Duty where you can knife a camper, or kill him with 3 bullets from an Assault Rifle.\n...Speaking of camping, good luck with that. Standing still is just about the worst thing you can do in the game, not to mention there's barely any spots to do it. (Pillboxes on some of the maps excluded)\n\nWeapons - Unique as all hell! Lemme give you a run down of what weapons there are:\n-Impact Hammer: Your only melee. It sucks. Hold down your primary fire to charge it up and then slam it into someone to turn them into a meaty pile of flesh. Alternate Fire if they're at low health and you have nothing else.\n-Enforcer: Your pistol. Low in damage, and it also sucks. Primary fire does accurate shots, low fire-rate, alternate fire does highly inaccurate, high fire-rate shots.\n-GES biogun (or whatever it's called): A "Sortof" pistol, more like an SMG. It fires hazardous, glowing waste at your enemies, which procedes to melt them into a fine goo. Goo sticks to walls, and bursts after an amount of time, hurting any enemies nearby. Primary fire sprays it like a monkey throwing ♥♥♥♥ while on cocaine. Alternate fire charges a shot to make a giant, insta-kill ball of goo. "Insta-kill is over-powered, don't you think?" Nope. It is IMPOSSIBLE to hit somebody with the giant goo balls, the projectile is too slow, and the range is too short. You'd have to be hitting someone standing still, or get a lucky/skillfully aimed shot.\n-ASMD Shock Rifle: OH BOY A RAILGUN. Primary fire shoots a decently-powered bolt of blue energy, at instantanious speed. It is 100% accurate, no spread. Alternate fire shoots a ball of the same type of blue energy, at a slow speed. If you shoot the ball with another ball, or the primary fire bolt, it explodes into an electric explosion thingy that is sure to pastilize anyone nearby. In Unreal Tournament 3, the ball implodes, sucking any unlucky persons into a temporary black hole. THE MORE YOU KNOW!\n-Plasma Rifle: You can see the naming of this gun was just as unique as the previous ones /s. Primary fire shoots slow-moving tiny balls of green plasma ( that don't implode/explode D: ) which deal some.... pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good damage. Good for usage in tiny spaces like tunnels. Bad in outer areas. Like outside. Don't use it outside. Alternate fire shoots- ZOMG IT'S A ♥♥♥♥♥' LAZOR BEAM!!!1! The laser beam has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage, but if you're accurate, you'll slice'n'dice your target in a second or two.\n-The Ripper: One of the nastiest ideas of a weapon i've heard of, The Ripper shoots giant mother-♥♥♥♥ing razor blades at your target. Some explode. We're getting emo on these ♥♥♥♥♥es. Primary fire shoots a highly volatile razor disc that ricochets like a bullet in a safe, and it doesn't stop until a while. WARNING: THERE IS A 75% CHANCE THESE BLADES WILL KILL YOU INSTEAD OF YOUR TARGET. DO NOT USE IN TIGHT QUARTERS. Alternate fire shoots an EXPLODING ♥♥♥♥ING RAZOR BLADE. WHO THOUGHT THIS ONE UP?!\n-Minigun: ....You know damn well what this gun does. Primary fire for semi-accurate, decent-speed minigun fire. Alternate for BBBBBBUUUUUULLLEEEEEETTTTT SSSSSSPPPPPAAAAAAAAMMMMM and extreme inaccuracy.\n-Flak Cannon: By far, my favorite gun. Essentially, it's a shotgun attached to a "Thumper" (grenade launcher). Primary fire shoots super-heated flak, which CAN bounce off of walls and kill you. Alternate fire shoots a grenade that explodes into flak.\n-Rocket Launcher: Primary fire for very slow rockets. Hold it down to prep up to 6 rockets, good for choke points. Alternate fire shoots ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pipe-bombs that hardly work. Hold down to prep up to 6 of them to launch.\n-Sniper Rifle: Primary shoots. Alternate scopes.\n-Redeemer: Primary fire destroys the universe. Alternate let's you find where you want to begin the destruction of the universe.\n\nThey all feel good and fun, a generally enjoyable experience. The biggest complaint I have is with bots and Rocket Launchers, they aim a bit too good with those things in tight quarters.\n\n\nMaps: Some of the best map designs i've ever seen, I mean this game is doing better then CoD by a mile. There's hidden power-up rooms, treacherous hazards, risk-and-reward areas, seperate routes spread everywhere, and unique usage of the environment. Mother Nature(Property of Liandri Corp.) wants dat ♥♥♥, boi.\n\nStory (for campaign): Ehhhh. This game didn't really have much. It gives you a starter intro, and some pretty good filler, as you can read up on your enemy's backstory as you prepare for battle. It even tells you their fighting styles. But the "story" is just some slapped on entertainment, the polish to the fancy sports car.\n\nBosses/end battles: There is one, and ONLY one.\nXan Kriegor.\nThe whole game is you fighting your way to the top of the ranks of the Unreal Tournament to hopefully beat him and become the true champion. Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ, even on the easiest difficulty, this guy can be difficult. I'm still trying to beat him on one of the harder difficulties (I'm dreading the God-Like difficulty when I reach it). Essentially, Xan is the Shao Kahn (Mortal Kombat's final boss) of Unreal Tournament.\n\nBonus Points: Terrific AI, and a ♥♥♥♥♥ON of difficulty settings. The options menu is also well-made, and the music is mindblowing.\n\nFinal verdict: TENOUTTATEN. I'm serious, full 10/10. I can't give it less. I have yet to find a bug (aside from a bot getting stuck in a window a few times. Heh.) or issue with the game I do not like. It is one of the most well-programmed games ever made, the music is action-packed or sometimes relaxing, the maps, omfg the maps... This game is just awesome extract.\nHOWEVER,\nDespite the 10/10 rating, I do NOT suggest this game for all gamers. It is EXTREMELY fast-paced, you need fast reactions and fast hands (huehue) to get through it as a pro.\n\nIs the price right? Yes and no. Yes, it's worth it for the game, I URGE you to buy it. But no, as the game is pretty old by now, it should be lowered to atleast $7.50, though I believe $5.00 would be more appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT LISTEN TO THE ♥♥♥♥WITS GIVING IT BAD RATINGS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T INSTALL IT. The game was made in 1999, and it's Window's fault if anything at all that they aren't compatible. Dual drivers have issues with the game's framerate, and more issues. The technical support page hasn't been updated in forever (Because this game was made in 1999, damnit).","October 24, 2014","true","15.3"," 140 of 152 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","140","152","15","9"

And you can let their difficulty AUTO-ADJUST to fit EXACTLY at your skill level!  Bots should be standard in FPS imo.  ESPECIALLY MULTIPLAYER!  The player should NEVER be slave to what others want to play.  No players, no game in multiplayer gaming.  This is why I can still play Unreal Tournament when and how I want FOREVER!  And I have done exactly that so far.\n\nOther than brilliant base gameplay, you have TONS of amazing mods for this game that are most often COMBINABLE AND CUSTOMIZABLE!  Tailor the experience to EXACTLY what you want!  I love it.\n\nFantastic map designs and creative weapons with MORE functionality than most shooters.  Two fire modes such as the Flak Cannon the fires a shotgun-blast of bouncing flak pellets OR an impact grenade that sprays some flak pellets on impact!  Maps in space and space stations, maps in medieval castles, so much variety in map choices and a few extremely unique ones!  Not to mention the variety of game modes which include team deathmatch, free-for-all, capture-the-flag, domination (point capture-and-hold mode), and best of all ASSAULT!\n\nAssault game mode still belongs to Unreal Tournament.  This is the originator of that mode.  Accomplish one objective after another as a team and with such variety in maps and objectives to do it!  Like some brilliant combination of linear, singleplayer shooters and competitive multiplayer!  Cooperative and competitive at the same time!\n\nI wish I could play this with friends to share the joy, but bots keep the experience alive forever!","November 26, 2015","true","25.5"," 101 of 106 people (95%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","95","101","106","14","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/13240/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","A classic and still my favorite Unreal title, the original Unreal Tournament is a marvel of gaming excellence and is a benchmark other deathmatch shooters should strive to meet.  My first encounter with this game was on the PS2 and this GotY Steam version is only better, so if you've ever played this game you should definitely pick up this improved version.  The gameplay is just as good as it always has been and hasn't added any unnecessary complexity with the GotY tag.  Its simplicity is what makes it so awesome, and this version is a prime example of that.  I could add that Mod support is built into the engine, the settings are excellent for such an old title, the gameplay is crisp, clean, and fast, the sound quality is superb...I could go on and on, but there shouldn't be any reason to.  If you like Multiplayer / Arena FPS you know what Unreal Tournament is and if you haven't played the original you're missing out on the game that defined the genre.  There are Quake fans, there are Unreal fans, there are Halo fans, and even Call of Duty fans, but all gamers can appreciate the history of the medium and the titles that laid the groundwork for the future, and Unreal Tournament is undeniably THE title that brought these types of games to the forefront of gaming culture.\n\nPick it up for nostalgia's sake or even pick it up because it's still the best arena shooter created to date, Unreal Tournament is a game no FPS (or gaming) fan should lack and is just as fun today as when it hit the shelves all those years ago.\n\nA+, do not miss.","July 17, 2013","true","8.8"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","0"

The sheer adreneline rush this game instills emerses the player in a far future galaxy brimming  with violence all for the chance of becoming the champion.\n\nVast amounts of arenas in which you can gib and telefrag your enemies are available, and a very large community grants a plethora of modded content and extra arenas. Apply mods to your game for even more crazy speed, extra guns, instagib, or other challenging, and game changing modes.

I would advise all people who have never experianced UT or UT99 before to read that rather than the information just below this line. Thank you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nOld review (Original Review) :\n\nI started to play this game back in 1999. I've been on and off for roughly 6-7 years and to this day i still play it everynow and then in my spare time or when i'm trying to kill time.\n\nTo me, this is the best FPS to ever exist in history and i think a large amount of old school players will say the same. I don't think an FPS game has came even close to knocking this off its throne, hands down this game deserves to be the king of FPS games for a VERY long time.\n\nNow you're probably asking.. "Why do you rate it so highly?" Well, apart from trusting what im saying - its a game you simply need to purchase and test for yourself to understand why. This may be old and outdated compared to everything you see today but despite that, it still has ONE of the BEST if not THE BEST gameplay and feel that you would expect every FPS to have.\n\nIf you're new to UT99 this game also features a "Campaign" if you would like to call it that where you can test your skills against bots on any difficulty you set as well as any gametype you desire. You can play all the gametypes offline and online. You have Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag (My personal favourite), Domination, Last man standing and finally Assault.\n\nPositives / + to this game (The good) :\n✓ Best FPS to exist.\n✓ Alot of gametypes.\n✓ A nice amount of players.\n✓ Unique maps.\n✓ Gore & taunts (Alot of BM = Instawin)\n✓ Doesn't need a powerful computer to play it.\n\nNegatives / - to this game (The bad) :\nx Cruel to new players, 90% of the servers are filled with experianced UT players.\nx Very fast paced.\nx A tiny amount of errors.\nx Nearly every server requires a plugin/mod that has to be downloaded in order for you to play on that server.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n28/10/2015 :\n\nThere is no other way to word it apart from the game being pretty much dead, if you're looking to play Unreal Tournament online and against other opponents then you are going to be restricted. If you do manage to find players they will be highly experianced players, old school veterans.\n\nThe only people who i personally suggest to invest in UT99 are ones who are well aware of its current state OR people who have previously played this before on disc and are looking to restore the feeling and passion they once had.\n\nIf you're new to the Unreal Tournament series then i would suggest playing the latest one released, it hurts me to say this because UT99 will always be the game i fell in love with as a child, the best Unreal Tournament as well as the best FPS in the world.\n\nUT4 Pre-Alpha is available on https://www.unrealtournament.com/ do not worry, this game is free. Yes you heard me, you do not have to pay anything. Anyone and everyone can download and start playing.\n\nThis review will not be updated or changed from this point on.","April 19, 2014","true","441.3"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","0"

People give Halo and other FPS games credit for stuff that was truly innovated in Unreal Tournament, and that is rather unfortunate.    Halo, Call of Duty, Titanfall, Destiny: these are names of pretenders to the throne that truly belongs to UT, in my opinion.   Quake was/is a great gaming series in its own right, but to me Unreal Tournament is the superior game overall.   The game modes are amazing in UT, as I wish some games would come out these days with a mode on par with Assault.   The number and quality of maps puts the games of today to shame.   We get DLC these days instead.    Remember when the online FPS genre had an amazing modding community?    I do, and that is why the great games of that era for the most part ♥♥♥♥ violently all over today's DLC infused garbage.   Lets pay through the nose for some maps though, instead of being able to create them ourselves as a community through awesome tools.","November 11, 2014","true","0.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

It may have aged, but only in graphics, because the gameplay is still fast and exciting. And with its many game modes and high quality maps, it’s a game that you’ll never get bored of.\n\nLong version:First-person shooters weren’t always the on-rails, self-healing, cover-to-cover interactive movies they are today. This genre was a scene of highly competitive players who were constantly searching for the next game to test their limits. And in 1999 they got two of them, one being Unreal Tournament.\n\nThe game featured a bundle of innovative weapons with two fire modes; memorable map design that is copied even today; game modes that finally showed something innovative beyond the same old death matches; and finally, bots which may feel a little dumb and predictable today, but back then they were topped only by Half-Life 1.\n\nUT may have been designed as a multiplayer game, but it is also enjoyable in single player. It has an actual campaign mode, where the “plot” may be simple as a doornail (you play in a futuristic gladiator tournament) and most participants only have a single-paragraph story, but it is still enough to build the foundation of a world you can immerse yourself in and make you care about your team. Because despite the popularity of free-for-all death matches, this game is all about team play.\n\nWith the ever-increasing issues with the game engine (which was one of the best of its time) and the even more successful sequel, UT2004, UT ’99 faded into obscurity, but if you ever want some really old-school FPS action, you can always rely on it.","April 30, 2015","true","18.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

UT 99 is arguably the most competitive multiplayer FPS game right next to Counter Strike. This is not a friendly game, don't expect to come in and start whoopin' ♥♥♥ instantly...no, no...expect to come in and start getting YOUR ♥♥♥ whooped instantly. Fast paced, gory, frag fest action at its finest. UT 99 is a game that is simple, you grab a gun (My personal fav being the Flak Cannon) and go find some meat!\n\nThe graphics of course may not be all that amazing, but graphics don't make a game, gameplay does and man does UT 99 offer that. With an arsenal of weaponry at your command and over a 100 maps, both by the dev, and the community, this is a game that I think will never get old, and the best part is after all these years, UT multiplayer is still going strong, just make sure you join a game with actual players and NOT bots. Trust me, you'll know if you are playing with bots or not. Single player is simple, you play in a tournament against bots, but personally, I skipped the campaign and went straight for the real deal multiplayer since I find fighting against bots...well boring. The soundtrack is foot-tappin awesomeness with fast techno tunes that go perfect with the sounds of rocket launchers and screams in the distance followed by the sound of body parts hitting the floor.\n\nThere is a ton of gore in this game so be prepared. I think UT can stand up to any game today and still win, yes, even Battlefield 4. I like UT a lot more than Quake III for many reasons. It seems what Quake III was flawed at, UT 99 was improved in. Now don't get me wrong, I like UT 2004, but there is something about UT 99 that I like a lot more than 2004. I'm not sure but 99 is just wayyy more fun and awesome for me that 2004 ever was. What else is there to say, it's fast, it's action-packed, it's gruesome, it's frantic, it's insane, it's intense, it's UT 99! And no need to worry about specs, any modern CPU can run this game perfectly smooth with no lag at all, believe me, I have a 1.0 GHZ processor laptop with AMD c-50 dual core. This is essential if you call yourself a PC gamer, and for the price of a book, you'd be silly NOT to buy this game! Don't let the difficulty of this game turn you off at first, UT is a game that is fun to play, but hard to master, it just takes time and patience to finally start getting into the swing of things and starting to get kills. So play UT 99 today! I'm sure you'll enjoy seeing your avatar die in an explosion of blood and limbs...:3","January 12, 2014","true","247.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulball5/recommended/13240/","paulball5","Zombait","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulball5/","350 products in account","Unreal Tournament is another absolute classic and was a worthy contender against other online First Person Shooters such as Quake 3 Arena. The game was a spinoff title to Unreal. However unlike Unreal (which focused on single player), the game was instead an arena shooter with online multiplayer in mind. Despite this the game does have a single player campaign. The story for this game is as follows, 100 years has passed since the events within Unreal, a mining corporation known as Liandri is hosting a no-holds-barred fighting tournament. You have entered the Tournament to become the next champion, by competing in 4 different leagues which have their own game modes and unlock the fifth league in order to beat the previous tournament champion Xan. There really isn’t much to the story and whilst there is more information within the single player campaign explaining the lore, character motivations and certain events within the Unreal Universe, it really doesn’t add that much to the overall story.\n\nThe graphics weren’t a huge improvement over Unreal, the reason for this was to increase performance when playing the game and maintain a high framerate with its fast pace gameplay. Despite this the game was still good looking for its time and the locations, level design, ascetics and environments in some maps is absolutely jaw dropping. A lot of the maps where set in different locations such as inside a spaceship, on an asteroid floating in space, inside an old medieval castle etc. It made each map feel more different and unique from each other. The soundtrack is also to the same quality as Unreal and is extremely good with some standouts like Foregone Destruction and Mechanism Eight.\n\nIn terms of gameplay you are given 6 different game modes, deathmatch which is a free for all, team deathmatch where two teams battle each other and the team with the most kills usually wins, capture the flag where two teams have to get the enemies team flag and bring it back to their own flag without the enemy taking theirs, domination where two teams have to take and keep control of key locations across the map, last man standing which is similar to deathmatch only players are given a full arsenal of weapons and have to stay alive as long as possible and assault which was a brand new game mode for its time. This is where players where broken up into two teams.(offensive and defensive)The offensive team have to complete key objectives in order to advance and win, the defenders have to prevent the other team from completing these objectives for as long as possible or until the timer ran out, both teams alternate and whichever team defends the longest wins.\n\nThe weapons in this game vary from familiar favourites such as the Flak Cannon and the Minigun and some new weapons like the Pulse Gun which replaces the Stinger. Each returning weapon has been given a minor tweak, such as having a faster rate of fire. The standout weapon among all of these is the newly added Redeemer a one use weapon which fires a rocket with a powerful area of effect annihilating anything within its radius. The bot’s in this game are extremely good and highly intelligent offering up a challenge when the player needs it. Overall Unreal Tournament is a fantastic game and is still fun to play today. The bots are a good enough challenge to play with and even though it isn’t played as much online today you can still find a game with a few people to fill in the server or if you’re setting up a LAN event any time soon then this game should be on your list.\n","February 29","true","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/recommended/13240/","BigJibblies","IIIStrife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/","206 products in account","Full Disclosure: I am a long-time consumer of the Unreal series, and a nearly life-long fan of both the Unreal series and Epic Games, the developer of said series. As such, I may be VERY biased, and my word might not be completely reliable, though I will try as usual to be as fair as possible.\n\nUnreal Tournament is an Arena FPS whom is THE grandfather of the entire genre, of games which are entirely based upon combat in planned stages designed solely for combat, not story. It has fallen into obscurity since Unreal Tournament 2004's release, so allow me to try and show you how this game became such a staple of gaming.\n\nThese days, you've got games that run natively at 60fps, support resolutions for 4K monitors and ultra-wide monitors, and you've got games now which are nearly realistic for appearance. Unreal Tournament, came a bit late, but used it's engine well, Unreal Engine 1, which originated in the first Unreal game, which is an Engine that, even in the 90s, was the cutting edge of graphic fidelity and quality. It stands up even now, despite using polygons, lacking facial animations, but each weapon, and each character looks great even still. Levels still look gorgeous and cool, and almost falling into space still makes me very antsy even after 12 years later.\n\nThe game has only three modes. The Singleplayer Campaign, Multiplayer, and an offline skirmish-style mode titled Instant Action. The Campaign is of you, a new combatant in the newest deathsport known as the Unreal Tournament, where convicts have been turned into gladiators whom kill one another and win with the goal of becoming The Tournament Champion, effectively attaining a sort of celebrity-status. Multiplayer is smooth and reliable. There are no problems with the game itself that I've found, even with this re-release. Modes for it, are identical to Instant Action, only some maps function with people, as you don't need AI pathing with human players.\nInstant Action's modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Last Man Standing, Capture The Flag, Assault and Domination.\nThe only ones which aren't obvious and in other games, are Domination and Assault, so I will describe them.\nAssault, is by far my favorite mode in virtually any game and it is a team-based mode with two teams. One team attacks a base, completing preset objectives and eventually aiming to complete them all, while the other team's objective is to stop the attacking team from completing objectives by any means.\nOnce the attacking team completes their objectives, they win the match, should they do all objectives and both teams switch sides, the defensive team becomes the new attacker, and vice-versa. At this point, the newly attacking team must match the completion time of the other team, or they will suffer a loss of the match. Though the sides switch even if the first attackers don't succeed, allowing both teams to attack and defend each match.\nDomination, on the other hand, is a sort of variant of traditional King of The Hill gamemodes. Only there are multiple Hills, or Points, which either team (up to 4 teams, unlike other modes, save for TDM) must hold to win the match. Holding a point wil generate one score point for the team every 3 seconds or so, and holding more points will generate more.\nIt also has something no non-Unreal title has ever really adopted whole-heartedly; Mutators. Think of a mod, imagine how annoying it is that you can't just tick it on or off, or combine it with others witohut conflict for the most part. Mutators allow you to change parts of the game, like Low Gravity, and entirely different set of weapons, or powerful relics that change the game's strategies, or even classics like Volatile Ammo (ammo that is shot will discharge, resulting in hilarity from shooting ammo than the enemy) and Fatboy (Where your character model gets more "fat" or just wider, with obvious texture stretching, based on how well you're doing. Whoever wins, usually ends up being the fattest, while the one who did the worst, ends up like a skinny stick figure).\n\nDue to the game being made in the 90s, the options menu isn't TOO varied, but it sort of gets hte job done.\nIt's got Video Driver settings, Resolution, graphics quality, texture quality (32 bit and 16 bit), A minimum FPS setting for video settings. It has the usual for audio, which technically hasn't changed for many games in years. You can alter the in-game auto-swap priority for different weapons, I personally have dual enforcers at the top above the sniper rifle. Input options are fairly varied with two different forms of sensitivity, and different mouse-based look options.\n\nThe game is difficult... if you want it to be. It has quite literally 12 different difficulties, from Novice to Godlike, there's almost no way anybody is too awful to play any difficulty of this game. With Novice, AI are painfully stupid, maybe even intentionally avoiding powerups in at least early singleplayer levels, whereas in Godlike, the AI become Kung-Fu gun masters, constantly know where you are and instinctually know when items respawn and always try to hog powerups aswell as having almost perfect aim and reaction, even mimicking players by spastically jumping around.\n\nThis game's soundtrack holds up today. In Unreal Tournament 3, most of hte songs are simply remixes of classic songs from this game, there's almost no single song that hasn't made it, and the music in this game are great for listenning when working out, writing, or even playing other games with.\nThe announcer is also very well voiced. It's dominantly used for custom content quite often, mostly in Gmod, though it's confused for the Announcer in Quake 3 Arena... which is actually more of a knock-off with 90% less recorded dialogue and announcements.\n\nThe game has barely any Story. IN the campaign, you are a newly brought-in convict in charge of your own team. Your goal? To climb the ladder of this tournament deathsport (which is canon as a sort of reality show to the human race) and to become the Tournament Champion by defeating it's first champion, Xan Kreigor... who is really hard to kill in-game. That's it though. You gain trophies though, and they still look cool!\n\nThe game comes with a decent amount of content, but given how some still play multiplayer, and that if you look in the right places, you can find over 10 GBs worth of custome content. Given how I once had only 2 gbs of content on my copy of the game in the past, that was over 500 maps, 7 game modes, 4 mods, and many mutators.\nSome of these maps have neutral AI players which are super-powerful and are remixed versions of other official maps, using a different theme, or maps of such quality, you'd think\nSome of these custom gamemodes is the wonderful Monster Hunt, like Assault, but the defending team is always the monsters, and the players are always attacking to get to the end before losing all their lives, or the chaotic 4-Team Capture The Flag. My second favorite is Jailbreak, bbasically Team Deathmatch meets Capture The Flag. Two teams aiming to kill one another and jail them, then watch them get executed, sometimes able to have prisoners of either team pit against one another in a 1v1 where the winner goes free, and it's possible to release your team by going into enemy territory.\n\nThis game is simply one of my favorites. It's always been one of my favorite as I can't remember a time it wasn't installed on my computer. Even just to play the Campaign, I've never forgotten this game, and I always have had a copy of it since I first played it when I was 10. If you like FPS games, or the idea of a gladiatorial arena-style game tickles your fancy, then pick this game up. There's more custom content than what I suggested like voice packs, models, even Total Conversions and far more.\n\nI recommend this due to it simply being one of the best Arena FPS' to ever appear on the market. I don't think you'll regret your purchase.","December 16, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Shameful stuff for sure and very not sportsmanlike too. I was in global top 50 for less than a week at one time long before the ZsZ clan debacle and it was fun but when I got around to the ZsZ clan I was just a home hobbyist having some clean fun ;) The game is lotsa fun and there's lotsa MODs and add-ons and for a inexpensive PC this is a very good buy. beware the online requests to install small files for server connection and security needs.

BUY THIS BLOODY GAME! For myself, I am not easy to sway. However, this game for the longest of time has had me in its' clutches. I don't really know how to explain this game, for I am horrible at explaining games.  It was one of the best deathmatch games of its time. I had this game on disc, so I have had some time with the game. I know that it seems strange, considering that I don't have much time on the Steam version. Why should I though? I own the game in disc form. This is a fast paced team/ free for all deathmatch. Large selection of maps and modes for those maps. There are also objective maps as well. Decent selection of weapons. Lots of options made for tweaking. You can customize all of the bots in the game, so they behave in different ways. Some can be more defensive, or they could just care about shooting and getting shot. If you have the time, which you need for this game, try this game out!

IMO the graphics hold up fine today and even if you don't like them the huge modding community this game had has provided texture packs and replacements for items. This game holds up fantastically today gameplay wise, there really hasn't been another arena shooter that captured UT99's gameplay, not even the later games. This, along with Quake 3, were the shooters that kept busy for years until call of duty came along. Everyone should give it a try once. Even if it's with bots. The online community is still somewhat alive though. If I had to rate it by my experience of playing it today, I'd probably give it around a 8.8/10, but with my nostalgia, I think this was the game of my childhood and I still enjoy it today. 10/10","December 30, 2012","true","56.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unreal Tournamnet was (and still is) one of the greats, Unfortunately, it's been forgotten over high quality graphics and lengthy storylines. UT does not have a great storyline, or level ups, or killstreaks. It is simply about dominating your opponent through violence. That pretty much sums it up.\n\nFor me, this was one of the very first FPS games I played on the computer, and the very first game in which I could decapitate/dismember an opponent. This type of shooter does not offer the player a lot of cover, and concentrates more on the player's skills and their ability to gunfight with the opposition. There are the basic powerups - body armor invisibility, etc. and basic good and not so good weapons. The maps are quite interesting, and the map "facing worlds" is comparable in greatness to Counter Strike's "de_dust2".\n\nThere's a reason why this game is reviewed so high, and even the younger gamers who missed out on this game will probably enjoy it.

The AI of the bots is brutal, the soundtrack thumping, and the arenas are classics that hold up despite their age.  Online multiplayer is dead and gone so realize you are buying this game for its singleplayer experience.\n\nUnreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition Review\nStory\n\nIn 2291, the New Earth Government (NEG) legalizes "consentual murder" as a form of entertainment.  Due to an increase in reports of violence among deep space miners, the NEG sees the organization of gladitorial tournaments as a means of redirecting unrest among the working class for profit.  The largest mining corporation, Liandri Mining Corp. (LMC) begins providing arenas for the Tournament as well as broadcasting the event throughout the known galaxy.  LMC's profits soar as athletes, condemned criminals, mercenaries, soldiers, and regular citizens travel across the universe to compete.\n\nThe game takes place fifty years after the NEG's unprecedented decision.  As one character from a diverse roster of participants, the player competes in the Tournament's various events for unique reasons.  The ultimate goal?  Depose Xan Kriegor, the undefeated Tournament champion, and claim universal renown.\n\nGameplay\n\nA first person shooter (FPS) in the truest sense, Unreal Tournament 1999 (UT99) sees players compete against AI and/or human opponents in a variety of game modes.  Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch have players racing to be the first to get a set amount of kills alone or as a team respectively.  Domination sees two teams fighting over control points, with every point controlled adding to the respective team's total; the first team to accrue a set amount of points wins.  Capture the Flag has the teams capture the enemy flag for points while defending their own at the same time.  Finally, Assault has one team in an offensive role while the opposite team plays a defensive role.  Maps that assualt take place on require the attacking team to complete a series of objectives while the defending team prevents them from doing so.  At the end of a round of Assault, the teams switch roles and the now attackers must either complete more of the assualt than the former attackers or complete the map in less than the time it took the former attackers to complete.  The singleplayer portion of the game involves playing through a certain amount of a particular gametype until the next Tournament rung is unlocked.  Each time you start a new rung, there is an optional tutorial level explaining how to play that particular gamemode.  Singleplayer is essentially matches against AI opponents who can be set to various difficulty levels.  The bot AI is one of the great things about UT99 because bots behave in a challenging, almost adaptive manner.\n\nEach game mode features maps designed solely for that gamemode with the exception of a few overlapping arenas.  Assault maps are the most linear whereas Deathmatch maps are more open. Some arenas are symmetric while others asymetric and complicated.  A few arenas even feature a special condition, such as "Morpheus" which takes place atop a stratospheric skyscraper and features low gravity for huge jumps.  Filling these outlandish arenas is a plethora of futuristic and conventional weaponry.  Take the plasma rifle for example: primary fire is a straight beam, secondary fire is a slower moving orb, but if you shoot the secondary projectile with the primary fire, it detonates causing a small explosion.  Most weapons feature an alternate fire mode and can only be reloaded by picking up ammo scattered around the arena.  Steady aim is important as most weapons chew through ammo fairly quick.  Health vials and various armor pieces can be picked up to increase your longevity although respawning is instantaneous, giving gameplay a brisk and hectic pace.  There are also items scattered around arenas to pick up like the anti-grav boots for huge jumps and scuba gear for underwater breathing.  Finally, modifiers can be found in somewhat hard to reach places that can boost your damage with weapons, health, or even make you invisble.  Knowing arena layouts, the limitations of each weapon, and where modifiers spawn is essential to victory.\n\nUnfortunately due to the age of the game, you should expect to only play UT99 in singleplayer as there are not many games to be found online.  Although sold as UT99: Game of the Year Edition, this version on Steam does not in fact include the game of the year content.  Ambitious players can attempt to track the extra content down however I have read that the missing content does not amount to much anyway compared to the base game.\n\nDesign\n\nEvery match in UT99 begins in free roam mode.  This allows you to fly around the map and learn where all the weapon/item spawns are, where the enemy base is, and where conflicts are likely to occur.  Free roam is also nice in that you can see just how detailed certain arenas can be.  Built on the same engine as Unreal (Epic Game's 1998 title), UT99 is definitely an old looking game in terms of chracter and environmental models.  However, every arena feels unique in its tone and atmosphere.  From the lighting to the architectural theme of each map, the level design feels thoughtful as well as considerate of the type of game UT99 is.  Adding to the frantic nature of the game is a nice electronic soundtrack featuring lots of drum and bass.  Who can forget the music of "Facing Worlds"?  Characters are voiced appropriately over-the-top and the weapons sound sharp and distinct.  The game features a thorough list of options so players can tailor and mod the game as they see fit.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLong before I was a PC gamer, I played the Infogrames Playstation 2 port of UT99.  It featured updated textures and additional maps not found here on the Steam version, but aiming was clunky with an analog stick.  I purchased the steam version largely out of nostalgia and a desire to play the game as it was meant to be played.  In these respects, UT99 did not disappoint me even though I was retreading ground.  Unfortunately due to the age of the game, you should expect to only play UT99 in singleplayer or with friends as there are not many games to be found online.  From the soundtrack to fast-paced tone of the game, UT99 and its 2004 successor are  the  arena shooters in my mind.","December 13, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

In an age where we pay 60 bucks for a bare handful of maps (looking at you Battlefront), Its hard to belive that you can get a game that has nearly a hundred maps to play on for $10, each one unique and hard to memorize. This game contains some of the most iconic maps in video game history, including Curse, Deck 16, and the amazing Facing Worlds.\n\n+Silky smooth controls. This game revolutionized the way movement was handled in first person shooters, and the movement mechanics still rival some of today's triple A titles. Thise game takes dodging bullets to a whole new level.\n\n+mutators! bored with your run-of-the-mill deathmatch? apply the low grav mutator for some mid-air combat, or the insta-frag mutator for one-shot death carnage.\n\n+Programmable and customizable AI. If youre feeling like a challenge, you can crank up the AI level to godlike, or if you're a filthy casual looking to blow off some steam, set the AI to average or novice and blow them to bits with your flak cannon.\n\n-Graphics are of course not that great, but what do you expect from a game that came out in 1999?\n\n-video settings can sometimes be a bit wonky. In order to get a resolution higher than 800x600, some messing around with the video drivers are required, as the default driver can't handle any more than that.\n\nWhy are you still reading? just get the game already.","February 28","true","76.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So my Steam stats don't paint the whole picture.\n\nPROS:\n+ Fast and frenetic gameplay.\n+ Fun in both multiplayer (online or LAN) and single player campaign.\n+ Instant action mode against bots is still a blast.\n+ "Mutators" jazz up the action even more.\n+ LOW hardware requirements; netbook friendly.\nI've played UTGOTY on an old Lenovo ThinkPad T61 with only an Intel 965 GPU, ran just fine.\n+ Linux compatibility via Wine.\nI've tested UTGOTY on Linux Mint 17.3 and Linux Lite 2.8, runs silky smooth.\n+ Mac compatibility via Wineskin found here: http://paulthetall.com/unreal-tournament-mac/\nI've tested UTGOTY with the Wineskin on an iMac 2009 model running Yosemite, runs great.\n\nCONS:\n- Graphics are 6th generation (PlayStation 2 era).\n\n*UT2004 is another rocker, with better graphics and vehicular combat. However, UTGOTY/UT99 has lower hardware requirements making it more accessible.","August 1, 2011","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was expecting the game to be extremely dated and bland but actually; it's as fast and fun as it ever was and is still absolutely brilliant with amazing memories.\n\nNo camping, no IED's, no grenade spamming, no quickoping, no mic spam, no fanboys, no microtransactions, no netcode woes and no commercial nonsense that plagues today's premium multiplayer games. UT represents the golden age of gaming and still played, enjoyed and loved by many now. It's fast, frantic and pure fun and at just a few quid; it's worth sacrificing a couple of beers for hours upon hours of nostalgia and enjoyment.\n\nPs; better than Titanfall;-)","May 11, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Some people do not like the linearity of the bots, but the multiplayer potential is quite good without the AI.

Michael van den Bos and Alexander Brandon's music is gonna ♥♥♥♥-blast your ears with pure god damn sex with one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear, while you get ♥♥♥♥ED with a flak cannon. This game doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥ foot around with low damage, low impact BS like your pansy ♥♥♥ "machine guns" and "shotguns. ♥♥♥♥ no, this game doesn't play around with that crap, you've got flak cannons, mini-nuke launchers, things that shoot green ♥♥♥♥, things that shoot blue ♥♥♥♥, and your starting pistol does 25 god damn damage.\n\n"But what about the standard weapon at the time: the rocket launcher? UT '99 has that!" Unreal Tournament won't be seen with your half ♥♥♥♥♥ rocket launchers. This game's rocket launcher can shoot up to 6 rockets at a time, or swap them out for grenades, for when your opponent is cowering behind a corner, or for shooting behind you when they man up and chase your sorry ♥♥♥ around the map, while you run away like a sunset loving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe maps are cool as ♥♥♥♥, y'got cool ♥♥♥♥ like space ships, skyscrapers so damn tall the gravity is low outside, some asteroid with giant towers that has no cover from snipers that get 2 ammo pickups and big ♥♥♥ armor pickups and its actually kinda horse-♥♥♥♥. Theres like this cool ♥♥♥ wooden structure thing on a tall ♥♥♥ mountain with no conceivable way in from the outside but its still cool as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTheres a bunch of game modes, y'got your standard CTF, DM, TDM, but theres also capture points, last man standing, and assault but I don't play assault cause the maps suck. You can even make the Team Deathmatch have 4 players if you want your ♥♥♥♥ing crazy deathmatches to be just a bit more organized, just incase you're a WUSS who can't take getting ♥♥♥♥ing obliterated with a shock rifle from 15 different angles. Which is gonna happen anyway, so get used to it ya lil' daisy loving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nTheres a tournament mode which is a series of scaling difficulty matches, but I mean really you just play it because you want to unlock the Xan Kriegor model. I mean I'm pretty sure you can edit your save or something but who does that? A little B I T C H DOES THAT ♥♥♥♥. WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO PLAY MORE OF THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME? DO YOU NOT LIKE IT? WELL SORRY COWARD, GO ENJOY YOUR GAMES FOR COWARDS, HAVE A ♥♥♥♥ DAY ♥♥♥♥FACE.\n\nI saved the best for last: Practice mode. This is the real ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥. You can customize up to 16 bots to your liking, tweak the ♥♥♥♥ out of the difficulty for them, pick their teams, change their appearance, make them Nali warcows, make them Nali, make them all Xan Kriegor IF YOU PLAYED THE TOURNAMENT CAUSE YOURE NOT A B I T C H. Pick the game mode, pick one of the fantastic maps, decide if you want the match to be totally unbalanced and fight 16 Nali Warcows in a TDM or CTF match, or have your own personal army and try to fight someone with max stats in everything. Theres mutators like changing the impact hammer with a chainsaw, instagib, etc. You can even control ♥♥♥♥ nobody really cares about like the speed of the game and how much control you have in the air. You can also turn off Hardcore mode if you like flowers and other gay ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI didn't even touch multiplayer back when I first played this, I just played with bots. I've only played multiplayer with one other person. Y'know what? All of these settings I just talked about CARRY INTO THE MULTIPLAYER. YOU CAN DO ALL OF THIS COOL ♥♥♥♥, AND HAVE A ♥♥♥♥ING BLAST OF A TIME, AND BRING YOUR FELLOW MAN INTO THE FOLD FOR EVEN MORE FUN. I MEAN I HAVEN'T DONE IT, EXCEPT WITH 1 OTHER PERSON AND IT WAS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME.\n\nTHIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME AND I'VE BARELY EVEN TOUCHED THE MULTIPLAYER.\n\nSo what're you waiting for? Oh thats right, I forgot. You better get a bucket, sweatband and a towel. Cause if you're gonna play this game, AND IF YOU DON'T THEN WE CAN NEVER HAVE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP, you're gonna need these things. Why? Cause you'll be sweating profusely, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ uncontrollably because this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I first played this game when I was 3 years old, 16 years ago. This game gave me a 6-pack, and biceps so intense that they started to become sentient, all in the course of a day.\n\nIf this game was a person, it would be a huge hulking badass man that everybody has strong romantic feelings towards, and would stalk him to the gym, where he would instead, of working out, just eat metal and drink wood shavings while educating children about the finer things in life, like himself.\n\nThis game ♥♥♥♥ing owns. On a 5 point scale, I give this game a 5000/5. ♥♥♥♥ yeah I recommend this game.","April 17","true","29.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","2"

Nothing beats this game.\nAnyway, does anyone feels like ♥♥♥♥ing screaming/beating at 'Gamers' as they don't even know UNREAL TOURAMENT? like who doesn't know the game that could truly go TOE-TO-TOE with QUAKE. I did a 2 minute research on why in the blue hell is Unreal Tourament not as popular or MORE popular than Quake even though it is such a good game. I found nothing. Not going to dig further as it's 4.03 AM as I am making this review.\nThis game is still a game that can go against CS:GO if it was recreated. It need advertising, a good fan base. It's a  really good game, my childhood game. I was playing this non-stop until my Dad showed me another game, combat arms. He thought Unreal Tourament was too brutal.

I have a pretty decent PC ( i5-3570K, 8GB, SSD,  GSX 660 ) yet I get random pauses during game play and long waits at the start of each level telling me it's "precaching". I used to love this game this is totally unplayable.\n\nThe company has put no effort into compatability with modern graphics cards and no effort into using better textures or using any of the better user designed levels. I stopped playing after just two screens and thought "I've been had". Can I get my money back?\n\n[EDIT]\nAfter a lot of trial and error I found that switching to OpenGL in the graphics options fixes the pause options I was getting. I'm quite enjoying the game now. I still think it should be cheaper, with better textures and additional maps. It just seems like a wasted oportunity to me and the price still seems steep for an 18 year old piece of software.\n\nI do love the game though :(","March 16","false","6.9"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","6","19","0","0"

The maps gave me that nostalgia feeling it was so good playing the maps again but there are a few I don't like. The guns are all different and they have primary and secondary fire so know how to use them in combat because it can be really fun.

Out of all the Unreal Tournament games, this is probably my favorite game, and it isn't just nostalgia talking there either.\n\nUnreal Tournament is pretty fast-paced. The guns are also different; you have your standard bullet-firing Enforcer and Sniper Rifle, and you have more exotic types like the plasma-firing Pulse Gun and the bio-sludge firing... Bio Gun.\n\nThe modding community behind this game is immense, and is still alive even today. Installing mods is as easy as grabbing the right UMOD, and installing it, or in the absence of a UMOD, you just drag-and-drop files to the right directory.\n\nThis game offers a story-line too, but as with other games in the series, it's mainly you vs bots on known multiplayer game types (CTF, Deathmatch, etc). Bots have various levels of difficulty, and make great practice.\n\nMutators are also a fun way to spice-up matches. Tired of the old weapons, and want a match with more insta-kill shenanigans? Throw on Instagib and get a modified Shock Rifle that delivers red beams of insta-death :p New mutators can also be delivered through mods.\n\nA really popular recommended mod to get is ChaosUT, and I believe it even came with original Unreal Tournament GOTY discs back in the day (but is strangely absent from the Steam version).\n\nThe graphics may look a bit dated, but guess what? You can also fix that easily through mods :) Original GOTY discs also used to ship with ST3C textures to enhance the game's textures. These are nice and all, but the site UT Textures also offers even higher-quality textures for low-end (still better than the original ST3C textures), high-end, and extreme-end computers. Pair that with a newer renderer (like Marijn Kenti's D3D10 renderer, or the D3D9 or updated OpenGL renderer on Chris Dohnal's site), and you'll have yourself a very nice-looking classic! ENBSeries has nothing on those modifications.\n\nAudio can also be updated. The easiest way to do this is to grab the updated multimedia package from Oldunreal's site. This allows for updated audio backends, like OpenAL and FMOD.\n\nThis game is a real treat, and it's really hard to find a reason on why not to buy it. If you've never played an Unreal Tournament game, haven't tried the classic version, or even if you want to re-visit a classic gem, get this.","December 7, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very fast paced, spontaneous and action packed. For it's time it was something different and new, it was futuristic and exciting. Everything from the various maps / locations. To the many characters to play as and battle against. Nothing is more satisfying then the announcer screaming "Mo-Mo-Monsterrr Kill!" whilst you completly destroy your opponets with a rocket launcher. It differs from the Unreal Titles, with less story and more action, it gives you what you want - futuristic weaponary, unqiue and exotic locations, sexy characters and dance music. The diverse game mods mmake game play fresh, however if like me, playing the vanilla maps over and over again can be repetitive and boring. Hence why I downloaded new community made maps which keep the game fresh. My favourite game mode is Monster Hunt (or Team Monster Hunt), which combines both the Original Unreal Game with the Unreal Tournament Game. I've since gone on to play the Original Unreal Games and the other Unreal Tournament Titles. It will be one of my favourite Series of games and I will always be a FPS fanatic. Defianetly recommend this game to anyone who wants to expereince a blase from the past, an original and classic FPS game (Or any of the Unreal or Unreal Tournament Titles for that matter).","December 28, 2014","true","66.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is also a total classic. It did come out in Oct 2000 so for it's age I personally think that this is one of those games that can stand the test of time simply for what the game offers. You may say, "Well, it's graphics aren't too good". There is a solution to that, a mod which can run the entire game in DirectX 10, which uses all of the fancy features that DX10 offers. So that gives gives it more longevity for those struggling to find a reason to get this game. For the actual content of the game there isn't much to say. It's an arena deathmatch game. It has a variety of maps; ranging from a tiny little elevator shaft to huge, low-gravity maps. There is a great selection of weapony from your ever handy impact hammer and supreme flak cannon which can obliterate enemies in close range (and yes this game is quite gory, but with the option of turning down or off gore) or your longer range rocket launcher, capable of both lock ons and 3 rockets at the same time, snipers, and ect. When it all comes down to it, THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY!!! That being said, I'd also highly recommend getting the Unreal Complete Pack as all of the Unreal games are great picks, ranging from the classics to modernized versions of those games.

Out of all the Unreal Tournament games, this is probably my favorite game, and it isn't just nostalgia talking there either.\n\nUnreal Tournament is pretty fast-paced. The guns are also different; you have your standard bullet-firing Enforcer and Sniper Rifle, and you have more exotic types like the plasma-firing Pulse Gun and the bio-sludge firing... Bio Gun.\n\nThe modding community behind this game is immense, and is still alive even today. Installing mods is as easy as grabbing the right UMOD, and installing it, or in the absence of a UMOD, you just drag-and-drop files to the right directory.\n\nThis game offers a story-line too, but as with other games in the series, it's mainly you vs bots on known multiplayer game types (CTF, Deathmatch, etc). Bots have various levels of difficulty, and make great practice.\n\nMutators are also a fun way to spice-up matches. Tired of the old weapons, and want a match with more insta-kill shenanigans? Throw on Instagib and get a modified Shock Rifle that delivers red beams of insta-death :p New mutators can also be delivered through mods.\n\nA really popular recommended mod to get is ChaosUT, and I believe it even came with original Unreal Tournament GOTY discs back in the day (but is strangely absent from the Steam version).\n\nThe graphics may look a bit dated, but guess what? You can also fix that easily through mods :) Original GOTY discs also used to ship with ST3C textures to enhance the game's textures. These are nice and all, but the site UT Textures also offers even higher-quality textures for low-end (still better than the original ST3C textures), high-end, and extreme-end computers. Pair that with a newer renderer (like Marijn Kenti's D3D10 renderer, or the D3D9 or updated OpenGL renderer on Chris Dohnal's site), and you'll have yourself a very nice-looking classic! ENBSeries has nothing on those modifications.\n\nAudio can also be updated. The easiest way to do this is to grab the updated multimedia package from Oldunreal's site. This allows for updated audio backends, like OpenAL and FMOD.\n\nThis game is a real treat, and it's really hard to find a reason on why not to buy it. If you've never played an Unreal Tournament game, haven't tried the classic version, or even if you want to re-visit a classic gem, get this.","December 7, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very fast paced, spontaneous and action packed. For it's time it was something different and new, it was futuristic and exciting. Everything from the various maps / locations. To the many characters to play as and battle against. Nothing is more satisfying then the announcer screaming "Mo-Mo-Monsterrr Kill!" whilst you completly destroy your opponets with a rocket launcher. It differs from the Unreal Titles, with less story and more action, it gives you what you want - futuristic weaponary, unqiue and exotic locations, sexy characters and dance music. The diverse game mods mmake game play fresh, however if like me, playing the vanilla maps over and over again can be repetitive and boring. Hence why I downloaded new community made maps which keep the game fresh. My favourite game mode is Monster Hunt (or Team Monster Hunt), which combines both the Original Unreal Game with the Unreal Tournament Game. I've since gone on to play the Original Unreal Games and the other Unreal Tournament Titles. It will be one of my favourite Series of games and I will always be a FPS fanatic. Defianetly recommend this game to anyone who wants to expereince a blase from the past, an original and classic FPS game (Or any of the Unreal or Unreal Tournament Titles for that matter).","December 28, 2014","true","66.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me, this is the first FPS I ever played so I enjoy it maybe more than the average person. However, this is a truly great no-frills arena FPS and if you've never experienced such a thing and are tired of all the CoD tripe then I highly reccomend it. If you're the kinda person who likes casual FPS and looking at pretty graphics... well I'd still try it but it's probably not for you. XD\n\nPros:\n+Balance - some weapons are more powerful than others, but what really counts is SKILL\n+Gametypes - DM, TDM, Domination, CTF, Assault, and more\n+Level Design - they just don't make 'em like this anymore\n+Amount of Levels - more than enough to keep you from getting bored for a long time\n+Singleplayer Tournament - climb the ladder in different gametypes with pretty decent team AI when commanded properly\n+Multiplayer - Stille active after all these years, and doesn't require a silly gamespy account\n\nCons:\n-Dated Graphics\n-Takes some tweaking to get your mouse functioning properly (more on this below)\n\n*Mouse Setup Guide*\n1. Grab the Direct3D9 Renderer from here[www.cwdohnal.com].\n2. Put D3D9Drv.dll and D3D9Drv.int in your "Steam\steamapps\common\Unreal Tournament\System" folder\n3. Use your graphics card control panel to disable v-sync\n4. Use your graphics card control panel to limit your fps to your monitors refresh rate (i.e. 60Hz monitor = 60fps cap) this prevents the game from running in superfast mode. If you aren't sure of your monitors refresh rate, just cap it at 60. A useful program for doing this with Nvidia cards is Nvidia Inspector[www.guru3d.com].\n5. As always, make sure you have Windows built-in mouse acceleration disabled. Go to your control panel>Mouse Properties>Pointer Options and uncheck "Enhance pointer precision" because in reality this hinders your precision by applying OS-level mouse acceleration! This last step is essential for all FPS games.","May 13, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While UT2004 (and 2003 and 3) are all great, the three are all their own entries, and this is probably the best. Nearly 15 years later, Unreal Tournament still remains an outstanding first-person shooter with some of the best FPS design (along with Q3A).\n\nNothing about it feels dated, and arguably first-person shooter game design as a whole has regressed from this and Q3A's high-level mental gaming and high skill ceiling shooters. Incredible pacing, maps designed to facilitate movement and area control, weapons with utility and balance, skillful gunplay all lead to the high-level mental games that really make the challenge and high skill ceiling the time.\n\nEpic really struck gold with this in every way, and I'd highly suggest that everyone give this game a weekend to start that spark within them. It's not particularly casual, but the bots are still plenty fun (especially for non-pros) and if that and the excellent design aren't enough to sway you, there're plenty of mods and custom maps for it as well (though I think UT2004 really is the best of the series for mods).","July 9, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People generally enjoy playing this game, this game named Unreal Tournament. Out of the set of all people, this tiny subset called me is going to review the game. Are you ready for this subset? I hope you are.\n\nOK. So, this game is like a really good spiritual successor to Combat for Atari. But imagine instead of random pixels, you had people with guns. Now imagine it's not just a 1 and 1 and it's like a whole bunch of people together, running, running around the room.\n\nImagine bullets flying and you have to dodge them. Then imagine sometimes not dodging them and then that's when you die.\n\nI bought this game twice. Once when it was the jam (1999), and once when it wasn't the jam (Steam). If you really think about it though, both purchases cover the two states of jamming, both jamming and not jamming.\n\nPlease note, that there are better Arena shooters (for example, Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA), however this one holds a special place in my heart as being the arena shooter that really got the "feel" of what is now known as ":unts: :unts:" music, what we now know as Steve Aoki.\n\nThere is some talk about a new Unreal Tournament coming out that is crowd funded, but I think Shovel Knight took all the crowds money so everyone's poor now, so you might want to start coding your own.

It is very fast paced, spontaneous and action packed. For it's time it was something different and new, it was futuristic and exciting. Everything from the various maps / locations. To the many characters to play as and battle against. Nothing is more satisfying then the announcer screaming "Mo-Mo-Monsterrr Kill!" whilst you completly destroy your opponets with a rocket launcher. It differs from the Unreal Titles, with less story and more action, it gives you what you want - futuristic weaponary, unqiue and exotic locations, sexy characters and dance music. The diverse game mods mmake game play fresh, however if like me, playing the vanilla maps over and over again can be repetitive and boring. Hence why I downloaded new community made maps which keep the game fresh. My favourite game mode is Monster Hunt (or Team Monster Hunt), which combines both the Original Unreal Game with the Unreal Tournament Game. I've since gone on to play the Original Unreal Games and the other Unreal Tournament Titles. It will be one of my favourite Series of games and I will always be a FPS fanatic. Defianetly recommend this game to anyone who wants to expereince a blase from the past, an original and classic FPS game (Or any of the Unreal or Unreal Tournament Titles for that matter).","December 28, 2014","true","66.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me, this is the first FPS I ever played so I enjoy it maybe more than the average person. However, this is a truly great no-frills arena FPS and if you've never experienced such a thing and are tired of all the CoD tripe then I highly reccomend it. If you're the kinda person who likes casual FPS and looking at pretty graphics... well I'd still try it but it's probably not for you. XD\n\nPros:\n+Balance - some weapons are more powerful than others, but what really counts is SKILL\n+Gametypes - DM, TDM, Domination, CTF, Assault, and more\n+Level Design - they just don't make 'em like this anymore\n+Amount of Levels - more than enough to keep you from getting bored for a long time\n+Singleplayer Tournament - climb the ladder in different gametypes with pretty decent team AI when commanded properly\n+Multiplayer - Stille active after all these years, and doesn't require a silly gamespy account\n\nCons:\n-Dated Graphics\n-Takes some tweaking to get your mouse functioning properly (more on this below)\n\n*Mouse Setup Guide*\n1. Grab the Direct3D9 Renderer from here[www.cwdohnal.com].\n2. Put D3D9Drv.dll and D3D9Drv.int in your "Steam\steamapps\common\Unreal Tournament\System" folder\n3. Use your graphics card control panel to disable v-sync\n4. Use your graphics card control panel to limit your fps to your monitors refresh rate (i.e. 60Hz monitor = 60fps cap) this prevents the game from running in superfast mode. If you aren't sure of your monitors refresh rate, just cap it at 60. A useful program for doing this with Nvidia cards is Nvidia Inspector[www.guru3d.com].\n5. As always, make sure you have Windows built-in mouse acceleration disabled. Go to your control panel>Mouse Properties>Pointer Options and uncheck "Enhance pointer precision" because in reality this hinders your precision by applying OS-level mouse acceleration! This last step is essential for all FPS games.","May 13, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Headshot!\n\nUT remains a classic multiplayer FPS that continues to influence game creators to this day. When it was released, Epic Games was competing with id Software for the FPS crown. Both companies decided to focus on multiplayer, with offline play supported by bots. While id's Quake 3: Arena went with stripped-down gameplay polished to a high sheen, Epic crammed in as many features and game modes as they could.\n\nBesides the standard Deathmatch and CTF modes, UT introduced new modes like Assault that focused heavily on team-based action. Mutators that changed different aspects of the gameplay could be applied to any match and added lots of variety. Each weapon had a primary and secondary mode, which greatly increased the strategies available with each one. And while UT had the standard corridor-based Deathmatch maps, it also had huge open maps that were a sniper's dream, and many of them were larger than had ever been seen in a FPS at he time.\n\nThe classic gameplay still holds up, though most players gravitate to the game's successor, UT2K4, which took everything good about UT and cranked it up to 11 while adding many more unique features. If you want to see where modern shooters have their roots, UT is a great place to start playing.","October 6, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll answer you: countless. Even a FPS. But not any game, even less any FPS (called by some the dullest genre in game industry). But you need a GOOD game. A GOOD shooter. And Unreal Tournament is this good game.\n\nIts original, ahead-of-its-time gameplay made it stand out of the rest. For me, it greatly surpassed even Quake 3 Arena. The grounded, dodge-based gameplay granted the player frantic action, and a lot of room for tactical play, that welcomed those who lacked the perfectionist twitch accuracy needed to play Quake. For example, my accuracy was never that good, but being able to avoid direct combat by rebounding flak shards or turning the floor into a minefield of goo made me less useless in this game, and that's why I love it.\n\nUT's gameplay gives us something that Quake doesn't. In the same map, in Quake you could bunny hop or rocket jump all the way to one place and it just doesn't feel as nice as finding an actually creative way to reach the same place, as in UT. (Assuming there are user-made ports of some map that by default is exclusive to one of the games)\n\nBut even after you get tired of playing in all modes, all maps, with all mutators, there are user-made MODs. These are where the heart of the whole Unreal series is. The UnrealScript allowed players to easily create their own content for the game and publish it to be played by others, enriching the game, and extending its longevity. You're not allowed to utter the word "obsolete" in UT (Unless you're Xan Kriegor), when there are mods like ChaoseUT, Unreal4Ever, RocketX, ComboGib, Bunny Track, and many others.\n\nAnd even after all that, if you still don't want to buy this game and play it, I can't help it. You're hopeless (jk).","November 29, 2014","true","80.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say this game has aged quite well and is the best example in how to program a multi player FPS:\n\n- Awesome upbeat music, the best I have ever heard in a FPS and the voices of the combatans are superb, with insults and sreams.\n- Excellent bots AI. In high levels they move very fast and are accurate.\n- Masterfully designed maps, the very best I remember for a first person shooter. There are plenty maps to carry out very diverse combat situations. There are open fields or corridors, all filled with weapons, obstacles and original traps. You'll be fighting in water, with zero gravity.\n-Balanced and original weapons, all weapons are useful if you know when and where to use them and all weapons have a seconday fire which give you more options to engage combat.\n-Varied modes of play. The game features very interesting modes of play aside from the classic free-for all and team deathmatch, it offers you Domination and Assault. In Domination you have to secure the areas more time than your opponents and in Assault you have to complete a mission in a scenario and your opponents will try to frustrate your plans, in maps like trains, fortresses battleships, etc.\n-The controls are responsive and work perfect.\n\n\nThis game is so good that future iterations couldn't keep up the quality of this game...the game is perfect and there was no need to create a new version...

Most recently poking at Hall of Giants with low gravity using the Steam controller.  Lots of fun... Double Kill, Ultra Kill, Killing Spree.

So many servers are still active to this day despite coming out in 1999, being the main competitor of Quake at the time. This game stuck in my head for so many years and I still listen to its amazing soundtracks. I first got it back sometime when I was really young, and despite not knowing what I was doing then, I played the crap out of this game nonetheless. If you get the game (which I heavily recommend you do on all levels) I'd try out Monsterhunt as a gamemode eventually but don't forget to try offline with bots. With all the mutators and modifications you can make to your private games it is endless joy. There is also an offline vs bots Tournament (hence the name) where you can climb the ladders of different gamemodes to fight the final boss who I will not spoil for you, but is also my favorite UT character.\n\nEnjoy!","February 6","true","48.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still remember the era when online multiplayer gaming with likes of Quake arena and UT lead gaming forward and it was a massive hype. This game is a 10/10 especially rating as a retrogamer too.\nNo UT game compares to this one, not even the latest UT3 of 2008 and its disappointing to say that with every new game there doesnt seem to be much originality in the way of weapons, firing modes, environments unless its user generated even then not much. UT'99 beats even the latest releases. just repetition of old weapon designs and levels with very few innovations, which is probably what disappointed devoted fans overtime.\nOverall, the pros and cons;\nPROS: enjoyable replayable experience, a wide range of unlockable levels and gaming styles (Eg. Team deathmatch, single deatchmatch, CTF etc), quite fast paced and refreshing.\nCONS: Doesn't run well with newer systems since Win7 or newer. Win 8 and Win 10 users beware that you might suffer from fps lag and glitches unless you chaneg some of the preferrences settings.  Eg. I suffered a lot of fps lag while gaming for first time on my new win 8 system, and it was as slow as a snail until I changed the desired framerate in the video settings from 40 upto 100. ALSO to note that the default resolution doesnt help improve visual gameplay experience unless you switch it to 1024x780 or something.\nBut overall - HIGHLY recommendable.","February 1","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was so pumped to see it on Steam when I got my laptop but running it didn't work as the video lagged too much. Now, I have a gaming computer with even better specs and, of course, running it is a nightmare. I would love to play, but from what I can tell, I can't. If someone can help, that would be awesome, otherwise, I'll just have to stick with modern games... :(","May 22","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tons of content, great game modes, and some of the best gameplay ever concieved. Make sure if you're playing it on a modern computer with a multi-core processor, that you install the Unreal Engine Direct3D 10 renderer patch. It'll make the game run at modern resolutions and fix the multi-core speedup bug and make it playable.","June 2","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
