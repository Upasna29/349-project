Sadly without the mini-games, this becomes a Conquest clone.\n\nAs far as multi-player, there is LAN only and share a PC options, so no internet gaming, if you were looking for that.\n\nThat said, for the $3 sale price it works.\n","March 22, 2015","true","1.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

In the mini-games you have the ability to duck but you really can't with a keyboard/mouse and try to fire at an enemy nearly at the same time. This should've been taken into consideration when porting this to the pc.  And when in-game the menu-reminders take too much time leaving the screen. In other words, if your opponent fires at you? These irritating messages tell you something like that (even though you can see them doing exactly that on screen). There are many better options out there. Even the Sid Meir's Pirates would be better.","November 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
