I loved the soundtrack of the original. This game isn't even worth the effort of shovelling it on my lawn and I'm fairly certain if I did it would kill it. This game isn't necissarily bad if you've never played "Flashback: The Quest for Identity" but if you're seeking the nostalgia of your childhood, this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off very quickly.\n\nThe only thing this game has in common with the original is that the levels are very slightly similar and the main character's name is Conrad. The end. The game felt very "dumbed down". There are popups on the hud EVERYWHERE that say, "Go here. You can climb this. Talk to him. There's only one path you can take but we're going to tell you to take it anyway!" Luckily, those can be turned off. I decided to play the game on medium and found out immediately that the difficulty settings were made for console ♥♥♥♥♥. There's a health bar, light falling damage, enemies attempt to tickle you to death, and healing stations are closer together than Starbucks. They also tried to add an RPG aspect by allowing you to gain experience, level up, and spend points in different skills. In a few ways this is good but mostly makes me ask, "Why the hell would anyone add RPG aspects to a Prince of Persia like?"\n\nThe controls feel similar to the original but they added an extra jump button and an arc style aiming system. The controls were definitely made for dual thumbstick controllers and then (horribly) modified for pc. Aiming is done by moving the mouse up and down to adjust angle and then moving the mouse left and right to switch sides. This gets annoying when you're trying to adjust your angle and accidently move your mouse too far to one side, causing Conrad to turn around and take it in the butt. If you have a controller to use with the game then it might not be that bad but mouse and keyboard controls get frustrating.\n\nBug time! This game contains bugs. There were a few times while aiming that the mouse would become locked in one place and I had to right click furiously to get control back. There are also times when grabing onto a platform would cause Conrad to get stuck and stand in mid air next to the platform. I only encountered this a few times and it did not deter me from the game but then again it never happened during a part where it actually mattered.\n\nPlaying this game does bring back warm nostalgic memories in the sense that I want to go dig out my old SNES and play the original game. Overall I feel like someone who played through the original once when it released is attempting to remake the game on age old memories. The only consolation I have is that I purchased this game during a Steam sale and didnt pay full price.","December 20, 2013","false","2.0"," 146 of 173 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","146","173","8","6"

All other aspects of the game will disappoint you greatly.

It was a huge mistake. There is pretty much nothing redeeming about the product.\n\nLet me break it down for you: the area design is bizarre and exploring is both frustrating and tedious. The combat is imprecise and the enemies (on Normal difficulty) rapidly become bullet sponges. The platforming is even worse. The jumping animation is downright laughable and is hard to predict. I ended up skipping the cutscenes due to the painfulness of of the story, writing and voice acting.\n\nSome of the level art is nice, but it isn't worth suffering through the rest to see it.\n\nI regret purchasing the game and I wish I had listened to the recommendation to avoid it. The demo doesn't really reveal many of the issues of the game so considered yourself warned.\n\n\n\n","November 30, 2013","false","4.3"," 95 of 128 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","95","128","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehzig/recommended/245730/","tehzig","Teh Zig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehzig/","630 products in account","From the publishing house responsible for publishing games that you have bought based on novel to game adaptations of a certain new york times best selling author, comes a remake of a game you probably haven't played before, because you're all like twelve, and don't know what's good.  Flashback is a remake of a much better game by french publisher 'Delphine' and it was a god damn masterpiece.  This game is still very much french, but obviously tries to capitalize on the call of duty dollars by having the character shoot all of the mans instead of solving all of the puzzles or discovering all of the mysteries.  the game is designed pretty close to the original actually, besides different item placement and much more numerous enemies to shoot with your dutycaller9000.  The story is also very much intact, though this time done through full motion video cutscenes with voice actors.  The game is still pretty nice, and besides too much shooting early on, and about the same ammount of shooting later on, it is more or less faithful to the original.  If you disagree, the original is included with this game so it's like you get that too incase you don't like this one.  If you play this game, be sure to play on hard, as easy and normal dificulties are ♥♥♥♥ing garbage.  I hope that ubisoft has plans to develop and re-release a remake of the sequel 'Fade to Black' so I can complain about that too.","October 11, 2013","true","1.6"," 79 of 112 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","79","112","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CabadiahJehosaphat/recommended/245730/","CabadiahJehosaphat","Cabadiah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CabadiahJehosaphat/","130 products in account","As a fan of the original game on the SNES (or Genesis, depending on your choice of console back then), I'm honestly pretty disappointed in this remake. The character's controls are completely different from the original game, which were slower and more deliberate and catered more towards platforming and careful combat, and yet the environments and enemy design did not change in order to reflect the change in controls. I found myself constantly running myself off ledges due to not being able to control my character's run speed, but I was also able to float around in mid-air and catch ledges in impossible and goofy-looking ways, so there was never any danger of dying due to fall damage.\n\nFall damage was instant death in the original game, encouraging you to think about how to move about environments, and every stage had every jump and platform in the perfect position, and everything was exactly where it was supposed to be. In this game, all the platforms seem entirely worthless, and there is usually more than one way to reach the goal by simply hopping around randomly between platforms, and there doesn't seem to be a very intelligent path you need to follow in order to complete areas.\n\nEnemy placement also seems entirely random, especially in the first stage where annoying flying robots would shock you at incredibly inconvenient points, sometimes even during an autosave, causing you to constantly reload from death while having a stupid drone poke you in the eye.\n\nThe combat is also irritating and unbalanced. Enemies are almost always attacking you, and there are few options when it comes to running away or attacking. Enemies with guns will shoot you while you try to climb up a platform to safety, as well as the flying drones shocking you and never giving you a decent opportunity for escape. It seems to me that the developers didn't realize that the slow, deliberate controls in the original also required enemies to be limited as well in order for the combat to be made fair. Even though you are given less limited movement in this game, you are downright crippled in several common situations, which makes it incredibly easy for enemies to exploit you and kill you in very cheap ways.\n\nAnother grating annoyance in this game for me is the main character's dialogue and voice-actor. He constantly monologues to himself in order to give gameplay hints and witty banter, which is entirely unnecessary and really ruins the atmosphere. The dialogue in the original was simple, straightforward, and reflected the atmosphere of the game as being tense and dangerous. Having your character constantly crack annoying jokes when doing anything from using a healing station to killing an enemy really ruins the atmosphere, and I simply don't understand why they thought it was necessary to write the character in such a way. Another annoyance was having constant gameplay hints and camera pans to show you objects and enemies in order to hold your hand through the game. Game design like this is simply insulting and certainly does not follow the original game's example of clever, intelligent environment and gameplay design that encourages the player to think and experiment with the environment in order to solve problems.\n\nBesides simple design choices that I didn't enjoy, the game has a lot of dissappointing physics and gameplay glitches that make the game feel really cheap. Several times I would watch as my character moonwalks several feet after being killed by an enemy before finally falling to the floor, sometimes even walking on air off of a platform, and one glitch even made me unable to sneak up on enemies and knock them out (something you are required to do in order to complete some sneaking missions), due to the button prompt not appearing consistently.\n\nIronically, in my case, Uplay allows you to immediately unlock and play the original game without completing any achievements, which I would prefer, simply because this game is very flawed and simply does not live up to the design of the original. Speaking of Uplay, this program succeeds in making playing Ubisoft games through Steam entirely cumbersome and annoying, which gives me one more reason not to reccommend this game.\n\nIf you want a better puzzle-based platformer in the vein of Prince of Persia or Blackthorne, just play the original game, or any other game in the same genre. This game simply fails to deliver such an experience, instead trying to offer a shallow action experience with many inappropriate or broken mechanics.","February 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","2"

Difficulty is toned down; for example a simple elevator puzzle near the beginning; there were two triggers per floor; one to move the elevator to allow you to go up while forcing you to jump over the one between that and the elevator to set you back a little, did they really need to dumb that puzzle down? No they did not. Puzzles are dumbed down and the level design feels rushed.\n\nI like the gun aiming system (Use a mouse, not a joypad for that) but then the tasks that require you to do it do not require thought as the solution is shoved into your face thinking you are lacking a brain. Graphics are quite nice but the background could have used more work but then again, level design feels rushed but I do like how the new conrad looks.\n\nI'm going to be honest here; the game is flawed yet enjoyable, but I don't reccomend it because it's my review and I hate it when a reboot/remake dumbsdown simple puzzles and rushes level design to a mess that looks cramped as hell; leveling up is a stupid mistake seieng as the original game was intended for puzzle/survival than being combat-based; I stil lreccomendd it if you want a good platformer that feels new/original that doesn't involve mario or any indie developers at all but if you want a real challenge; go play the original.\n\nUpdate: The 1993 edition is god awful, it's not the original Flashback at all; just some rushed recreation of the dos game with no music/sound at all and awkwardly placed controls you can't map. To make the recreation worse; they have it look like you are playing it on an arcade machine powered on outside in the rain with an effect to make it look like an outdated arcade machine (Thank god the 1993 edition is free).","December 27, 2013","false","2.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Apart from the programing flaws, there are so many control issues, specially if you play with an Xbox 360 wireless controller and there are many crashes, if you load the checkpoint several times (playing hard so you die a lot), the game crash every 4 times you load the same checkpoint, and sometimes the game just crash.\nThere is the original flashback game that can be unlocked, but you play in a tiny screen, plus there are sound issues.

Out of This World/Another World was a rare pinnacle of side-scrolling platformer design, the sort by which few tried to emulate because it was so outside of the ordinary.  This small French company is practically unknown outside of the greater Europe area and I am very sad by this.  They released a game called Flashback which was the "spiritual successor" to OotW/AW.  The game plot isn't related, but it uses practically the same kind of gameplay mechanic and rendered everything in the same visually unique roto-scoped flat-shaded polygon engine.  The game has the plot of the movie "They Live" merged with "Bladerunner" and it was amazing for its time.\n\nFast forward to here and now.  And this is a spirtual successor to Flashback.  It's a completely 3d remake of the original game.\n\nAnd oh boy, does it stink.  The controls are awkward and unforgiving.  It tries to have mouse-aim gun play mixed with cardinal-direction-only D-pad control scheme of the original game.  My character can only walk left/right and change elevation at select points, but I can fire my gun in a 360 arc?  It just feels odd and isn't well thought out, particularly since some enemies can ambuse you from any angle now instead of in pre-defined locations as in the original.\n\nThe voice acting is bad, the sound effects are mediocre, and the visuals are nice at points but feel very flat.  All in all, this game plays and looks like a fan-made remake that somehow got access to a bit of a budget.","December 26, 2013","false","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The reason why Flashback and other similar 'chunky' platform adventure games worked (like Blackthorne) was actually because of it's limitations. Because you had to be immobile to fire and could only do so from a standing or crouching point, you had a firm grasp of the basics of combat. Because you had to get a short sprint before you jumped to vault over gaps of certain sizes, or you had to be at a certain point underneith a ledge to try grab it, you could gauge the input necessary at a moment's notice. This modern remake removes the limitations and attempts for a more free-flowing experience, with full-rotating aim and more responsive controls, which sound great at first, but it removes a big part of the foundation the adventure was built on : the rules of play. Rules are what define a game's challenge, and if you make them more lax, then there has to be new challenges with a similar feeling of reward. Unfortunately, the floaty feeling from the platforming and the more fluid motion and combat just make it feel watery in comparison.\n\nThis game falls into that pit between nostalgic form and new-wave revival. It achieves the strong points of neither, but seems to have accumulated some negatives from both. It's far from a terrible game and appears to be quite polished, but it just lacks any real impact or immediate enjoyment beyond ticking objective boxes.","March 1, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was an early fan of the original and was still a reference as how a game should be made.\n\nFirst thing people should keep in mind when playing a remake is keeping some of the original feature to link it to old memories for the hardcore fan and still plant in some new feature that will attract  new player to the franchise. The shity jump is one of the original feature and i was more than happy to see Conrad jump that way. If puting new enemy and turn it a little more toward the action genre is required to attract the young then why not, as some other as mention the story is intact and THAT is the important.\n\nThe only real complain i can make and im not the only one, is the voice acting and im pretty sure a couple a guy could put a mode online to change that completely . And BTW my main language is french and i would have preffer more american style of voice acting but that is personal.\n\nIn the end if you like the original you MUST buy this game and play it as a gift to your little self.\nYou Fanboy are never happy with anything!","February 7, 2014","true","46.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

If you had to fight more than one Morph at a time, you were in SERIOUS trouble. It was possible, but with a lot of dodging, moving and constantly getting a little hit in here and there. Here though? Not so much.\nThe level up system seems tacked on.\n\nThe last two stages were a repetetive chore to get through, and only because I wanted to see the disappointing ending.\nAnyway, this may seem like a huge rant, and...well, it is, but the game did have one or two redeeming factors. It looked ok. Conrad was ok as long as he wasn't talking smack. The hoverbike minigame was nice enough.\n\nThe rest though? Mmh.
