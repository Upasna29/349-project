The shooting of the gun is pretty cool, and I liked how the turret switching uses the haptic pad to scroll between turrets and options.  The teleporting mechanic is pretty cool also, and lets you teleport a really far distance, which is nice.  My only real beef with this game is that the enemies load from SO FAR AWAY that on the headset it's pretty hard to even see any of them until they get to within like 100ft or so. Trying to shoot them from that far away is also equally challenging, but possible. Also the enemies spawn from all directions, it can be really hard to keep track of em, but I spose that's what friends are for, since it has multiplayer too!\nI wasn't able to play in multiplayer, cause I have no friends, but if you're looking for something like Sanctum, but in VR this is a pretty good alternative.","April 7","true","0.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

This looks pretty awesome!\n\nEdit: Okay so I might've got trapped in Audioshield for like two weeks but I finally got round to trying this out. It shows heaps of promise with a really solid idea which needs some fleshing out. The teleport through minimap mechanic is awesome. Teleport mechanic needs some polish (an arc instead of a laser point would really help). Player weapons feel very wimpy right now and quite difficult to aim (shots are FAST but still take time to traverse the huge landscape). Walls are a particular pain to build and when you fail the game just stops so there's no way to measure how well you did just yet.\n\nAt time of writing, there's a lot of work needs doing so don't buy in without watching a recent video but I've got pretty high hopes for this one.","April 7","true","0.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

XLR has filled a gap in my software that has no substitution.  This game is down right addicting.\n\nThe Good:\nThe style and visuals are amazing. XLR has non stop action that requires quick thinking, good reflexes, and hand eye coordination.  There are a varitey of turrets and the availability to repair, upgrade and scrap them adds depth and creative strategy.  Resources are limited so you'll need to protect your investments or get overrun!  There is no hand holding here!\n\nThe Bad:\nI've noticed the increased size of the holo sphere in the last patch has caused my recommended required system to have considerable judder.  Along those same lines, after 6-7 waves my turret fire and increase number of enemies will cause judder and frame loss on my FX 8350 and R9 390x to a point I had to remove my headset (even with reprojection enabled).\n\nEven with these current issues, I recommend this title to everyone with a Vive that enjoys tower defense games with a twist of FPS.  There is room for improvement but at this price point you can't pass this by.\n","April 17","true","1.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'd like to see teleporting evolve. Right now, it's difficult to teleport to the edge of the playable area. It's difficult to teleport over long distances. A solution might be to hover a few balls of light in the air on the far map edges that allow for easy lock-on from a distance. Alternatively, enemy lock-ons would assist for teleporting if it placed you really close to the enemy. Plus, there's nothing like blasting a baddy at close range!\n\nI feel like the time between waves is unnecessarily rushed. I'm already limited by funds, so just give me a little time to spend my measley dollars...at least when in single player mode. Heck, I could even explore wall building as an option given ehough time to plan my expenditures.\n\nOverall, this is the beginnings of something great and I hope we get to see an overarching gameplay element develop!","April 9","true","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As soon as I got my Vive, I made it my mission to check out XLR as soon as I could.\n\nMy initial impression was that it was pretty good. It is really a combination of a FPS and a TD, and it combines the two well. The game starts with you in a central command room, and you are given moments to assess your environment in a globe that lets you peer in and out of, before waves of enemies start approaching your location.\n\nYou can either start building towers from the overview, or teleport right into the action by twisting your controllers 90% to a side and pulling the trigger. You are equipped with a building tool that lets you drop towers where you are pointing, and also a gun – something you will almost certainly need to use as the game starts. There is also an option to dual wield, by dropping your controllers to your waste and hitting the grip button to switch between the building tool and your gun – something I found very satisfying!\n\nUnfortunately, and somewhat understandably so as this is in early access, the gameplay is somewhat flat and there isn’t too much to do beyond trying to survive the waves of enemies. The game can get somewhat strenuous on the eyes thanks to the dark environment and the repeated flashing of flying plasma, from your towers, enemies, and even your own guns. I actually found myself having to remove the HMD when the flashing got a little intense. The sound also tended to be quite repetitive, particularly as you repeatedly spam-firing your gun at the enemies in the distance. When you lose, the game also dumps you back into the main menu rather unceremoniously, without any real indication that you’ve lost.\n\nThere is a co-operative aspect to the game that I rather enjoyed, however – it was pretty satisfying to focus on taking down enemies while your friends focused on building towers and defences around you. It was also pretty cool being able to see your friends out in the field when you’re looking through the overview, and I did retreat to this view when I got a little tired from the repetitive audio and flashing lights.\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty flat at the moment. But given that the fact that the game has barely been officially out for a week, I think there is plenty of room to improve, which is why I'm recommending this game. I rather enjoy TD type games, and am pretty excited to see how VR will give us a taste of tower defences – and so I will definitely be keeping my eye on XLR.\n","April 12","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hubli/recommended/447100/","Hubli","Ckrush the turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hubli/","141 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has HUGE potential to be good and has a great dev behind it, and the recent additions of new guns is a massive step in the right direction. My only problem is the guns feel absolutely terrible to use. (This review might sound negative but it's not, I love this game I just want the dev to see this feedback and hopefully consider it)\n\nOverall for the guns: Haptic feedback is needed, I don't think there's a problem with my controllers because I get vibrations and stuff in most other games, it adds a ton to the gunplay (at least for me) and I think this game would really benefit from it. IMO the guns should also stray away from the artificial recoil/kick that they have in game (especially the machine gun, i dont think its even possible to hit anything with it lol)\n\nPistol: Feels the best to use for obvious reasons, the vive controller is shaped like a pistol and this gun feels the most accurate and responsive. I like the new reloading mechanics, but the models of the guns need to be lowered or changed in some other way, as I kept banging my controllers together on every gun trying to reload. When there's little robot things suicide bombing my base the last thing I want to do is be fumbling around with my controllers trying to reload. This is a problem with all of the guns in my experience.\n\nSniper: Awesome, I like the 2 hand mechanics, but the scope is way too small, and the crosshair is too transparent. It makes it pretty hard to see, other than that this is a really fun weapon and more games should include snipers if it fits the game.\n\nShotgun: Didn't use this one much, so I won't really comment on it.\n\nMachine Gun: Holy moly the artificial kick is terrible on this weapon. As soon as you pull the trigger the gun is flying all over the place, and obviously your hand is not doing that in real life (unless you make it i guess) so it feels completely unnatural to use. This is easily my least favorite gun to use in this game, and the problem is made worse by the lack of feedback in the controllers when you shoot/hit something.\n\nGrenade Launcher: again didn't use this one much, won't comment.\n\nOverall for the game: Fun as ♥♥♥♥, but the gunplay needs quite a bit of work. If the problems mentioned above were fixed and more content in general was added, this game would be in my top 5 on the vive. I recommend it so long as you don't care about the things listed above, as they can easily be ignored by how fun the game is otherwise.","May 16","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Like others have said, it has potential. But right now it is not good or fun. There is absolutely no structure to the game. You are plopped down into an open space, given some guns and turrets then baddies come at you. The controls are bad, the guns track badly, the reloading mechanism make you want to just forget that the game has guns to play with, it is so low rez that you cannot tell what is going on. This is alpha state, maybe even pre alpha. Give the developers time to actually produce a game and not just proof of concept for friends to play, then maybe it will be worth selling to people.","May 14","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
