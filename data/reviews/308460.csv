The graphical style is pretty inspired -- everything looks like it's made out of cardboard and paper and the levels look like a child's playset. You can move the camera just about anywhere and there's also an option to see the game from a tower's perspective (watching it fire at enemy units). The art is definitely top notch.\n\nOn the flip side, the gameplay mechanics are not very sophisticated. The tower defense genre has dozens of titles that have innovative twists and interesting mechanics. This game is a bit lacking in that department. Towers are placed in a few fixed positions and have 3 levels of upgrades. Towers and upgrades are instant and there aren't any extra buttons to press. There are no end of level stats or bonuses for leftover money, and while upgraded towers do more damage I couldn't see numbers anywhere.\n\nOne mechanic of the game that is somewhat interesting is that each unit, tower, and bullet fired is modelled in the physics engine. This means that trees and destroyed units can block the trajectory of your tower's bullets, and sometimes units go flying off the screen when they are destroyed. It also adds some randomness, since some tower shots may be blocked and this throws off the timing for a wave.\n\nAll in all, though, the game is too simplistic for my taste. The art style is cool. But tower defense as a genre is a bit played out and this game adds nothing innovative to keep me interested.","July 5, 2014","false","0.6"," 98 of 120 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","98","120","0","1"

It just felt like a lot of hand holding. You can't decide your own place to build a tower. There are pre-designated spots from which you must chose. Among those there is only a few good combinations to place towers, if you don't place the specific tower on the specific slot the developer inteded you to put, You will most likely lose the level.\n\nIt's a decent game to chillax, but NO-NO for a hardcore Tower Defense fan.","November 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 67 of 88 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","67","88","3","3"

You can rotate this around and try different views like from inside a tower. But there is where all the 'key selling points' of this game end and a fairly generic game begins. You got waves, you can upgrade your towers, you have levels, it all scales up. Nothing really special.\n\nDownside is the missed chance to do something nice with the game mechanics or animations because we are playing with paper. When a tank is destroyed, it disintegrates... why not unfold or disperse into paper pieces? Ballistics are nice round balls. Why not paper darts or crumpled papers? Why not let a tank burn to the ground? Why can't you destroy a tree that is in the way? Missed chances to make this game stand out a bit more.\n\nUpgrading is also not mouse-frienly, and geared towards touch (where the origins lay I suppose). You have to click the unit, then a menu appears on the left side of the screen, you have to move the mouse and click the upgrade twice. RSI guaranteed.\n\nIn the end it is fun for a few round until you yearn again for a good round of OTTTD, Shad'O or Defense Grid.","August 31, 2014","true","0.7"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","29","40","3","0"

It's absurdly addictive :)\n\nReally wasn't expecting much of anything from this title at all.\nI bought it on sale figuring it'd make a nice mindless game for my 6 year old son.  As it turned out, it made a nice mindless game for Dad - LOL.  No kidding, I love it!\n\nWaves and waves of progressively harder enemy armored cars, tanks, and planes attempt to navigate the maze of defensive measures you place to stop them.  You start off each battle with a set amount of cash to buy pre-positioned guns.  As you kill the enemy tanks and planes, you get more cash to buy new guns or upgrade existing ones.\n\nThere is nothing to the manning of the emplacements (they fire by themselves)... the skill comes with what type of gun to buy, when to get it, where to put it, and in what sequence.  A sole gun in the right (or wrong)  place at the right (or wrong) time can make the difference between plastering the enemy before he gets his steam up, or getting overrun by the hun.\n\nThe music is a blend of cheesy bravado-style muscle pumping arcade noise - that somehow meshes perfectly with the action (I wouldn't change it).  The interface is remarkably easy (took me all of 10 seconds to figure it out - with no manual), and the entertainment value is undeniable.  For those who would complain about the graphics, I say they are perfect for what it is.  For those who would call the game too repetitive, I would guess they were not around decades ago to enjoy the genre of arcade games like Pacman, Asteroids, or Space Invaders.\n\n1 out of 10 if you're looking for Company of Heroes or Men at War; 10 out of 10 if you're looking for a few hours to kill ("just one more turn" anyone? - LOL)","December 8, 2015","true","84.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","16","17","5","0"

The whole game is paper-styled, so everything is made out of paper (duh). It is different and I like it, you will too probably. You have multiple kinds of towers, all useful in one way or another. You also have ton of different enemies, some air, some ground units. You have to think where to place what towers. Air units have their own path, most of the time shorter. Not all your turrets can attack air units. You must keep the "end" safe so less than 10 enemies would pass. You also have the ability to have a first person view from any turret.

It's like the developer had some good ideas that were hard to implement and when he got them working, he didn't do much with them.  Like the tower views.  That is all it is…  One view from a chosen turret.  No shooting or even turning the turret.  It's just a camera view.\n\nThe game is okay, but it's basic to the point of not really wanting to play it again once you get the 3 stars and 100%.  There are only 5 towers with 3 upgrade levels and 24 small maps.  You can only build towers on predesignated platforms and there are not very many of them scattered throughout the small maps, so you must choose your towers wisely!  Like only 5 - 7!  Once you figure out the correct combonation of towers to use and placement, there is no challenge anymore.  Also, once you place all of your towers and upgrade them, you just sit and watch the battle.  There's nothing left to do...\n\nIt's also got one bad design choice IMO.  The enemies don't explode or disappear from the track fast enough and this can cause unpredictable problems. Sometimes shots get blocked, making you lose the level and have to restart the mission over from the beginning.  If you are going for 3 stars, you'll need to start over sometimes.  It's not that bad and doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it's frustrating.\n\nAnimations are stiff, but the enemy are supposed to be made out of paper, so it fits the game style I guess.  The sounds are okay and fit the game well.  It's not a bad or broken game.  It's just very basic and at times, unpredictable.  Hey it runs in the highest settings on both of my Mac's so I give it a huge plus for that alone! :-)\n\nI "only" recommend this game to diehard TD fans looking for something new!!!

If you can't tell from the screenshots, it is a Tower Defense game made from cardboard. I bought this game when it was -80% (CDN$ 1.09) just as an impulse buy to kill an afternoon. I can say it is an ok game.\n\nPROS:\n- Turret First Person View. Clicking on a turret and selecting the button lets you see from the turrets view. Really cool, but you can't do anything other than watch. (Would have been cool if you could control the turret.)\n- Interesting level design, with great graphical design. The cannons look ok, and the enemies look great!\n- Obstacles like tree and dead enemies can block your attacks, or even the terrain.\n- Short, only 24 missions with Normal and Hard difficulty.\n- Simple Achievements\n\nNow here is where I nick-pick.\n\nCONS:\n- Towers can ONLY be placed in designated areas. Because of this, if you don't place the CORRECT tower that is needed to beat the level, you will lose. There is basically only 1 way to win each level. Some are super easy to figure out, others not so much. Very "Trial and Error".\n- Only 5 towers. Certain levels will take away towers as a challenge, making certain levels even harder.\n- Game feels very slow. I've kept the game running at x2 most of the time, and x3 when there is nothing else for me to do other than wait for the map to finish.\n- There isn't really an Options menu besides the Unity options menu that pops up when you boot the game up.\n- Only 2 music tracks. One for the Menu, the other in game. It gets very repetitive and annoying fast. No options to turn off music, so I had to mute the entire application just so I can have my own music.\n- No Steam Cards (for the people that care about it, like me xD)\n\n\nIn the end it's an ok game, and only spending $1 as a time killer was great. If you like TD games, it's a great game to add to your collection.  I'm not very good at TD games, and did not feel like spending the time to figure out the exact way I was supposed to win each level. Still fun though! ^_^","April 13, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm not sure I understand - at full price this game is $5, and in my opinion, worth every penny. It's not offering 100s of hours of gameplay -- it's only $5! Set expectations appropriately.\n\nSo, here's my take on War In a Box. The art style is superb and consistent throughout the playing field and the interface. Even the airsoft style pellets that towers shoot add to the style. If you're new to tower defense, the initial levels are easy introductions to the play-style. Paper Tanks uses some conventions in its simplicity to make the game more challenging (that have received criticism in the reviews). Limited placement of towers - you need to analyze the playfield and make the best choice for where to place the different tower types. Also, if you destroy a vechicle, it becomes a barrier for a short time until it fades away -- another challenging aspect that affects the type of tower you should use at various locations and when you should upgrade them. You also have to consider the playfield's placement of trees, buildings, and destroyed vehicles, cause you can't shoot through them. I found this all contributed to the enjoyment and challenge of the game, vice taking away from it.\n\nTowers have 3 upgrade options each and these options/effects are detailed in the game's information help section. Read up to make sure you know what you're spending your money on. In later levels it becomes necessary to swap towers out with different types to deal with the changing progression of enemy vehicles, land to air, air to land, easy to difficult, etc. , providing more challenge and management of resources/cash. By the way, the tower upgrades *are* visible and are consistent so you can tell which tower/upgrade you have deployed. If you're unsure, a simple click on the tower can tell you if it's got upgrades available. Sure, there are a couple of situations where there's an extra click required than probably is necessary, but this is a pretty solid port from a mobile-touch game to a desktop version.\n\nIf you find things progressing too slowly, crank up the time progression to 3x and things will move pretty quickly. Once you get familiar with the strategy and mechanics, you'll probably find yourself using this feature pretty regularly. Speed up the slower sections and tone it back for the more difficult, time critical areas where you need to swap out Canon Towers for Artillery.\n\nIn summary, you're not going to find 100s of hours of playtime, depending on your skill level, there's probably 5-10 hours of play available from lvl 1 - 24, maybe more or less depending on how much of a perfectionist you are (I like getting a 3 star rating on my levels). There aren't dozens of tower types and upgrades, there are a handful to manage and play with. Replayability is similar to replay in Angry Birds. Beat your level scores or try new strategies. Is it worth $5? For a good, solid, bug free experience, professionally presented with 10+ hours of gameplay -- absolutely!","February 26, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(they burn/explode, remain as coal-like skeletons (until they are impacted too much and vanish, i.e. shot down planes crash so hard into the ground that they disappear, except sometimes and then you get a nice burning wreck on the ground :-)))\n\n- if you select a tower you can on the left choose the tower view. it's nice watching. Just wish your money counter and some kind of "furthest enemy progress percentage" were visible in case you are just waiting for the next cash update or don't want to risk the leading enemy getting too far even though you are watching from a tower not trained on them.\n\nThe STUPID:\n\n- You are being told that towers can't shoot through trees. What they don't tell you is that the towers are stupid. Just plain stupid. They will shoot at trees when there are other targets in plain sight. They will shoot at single targets when waiting a fraction of a second would make it re-appear in plain sight. They will shoot at other towers as if they were trees.   Maybe with all tower types unlocked this will be less of an issue.\nMaybe this is intended to increase the "toybox" and wind-up toys feeling but it's very frustrating when compared to other TD games where one even can choose preferred enemy types, ranges/positions, etc.\n\n- Cannons that shoot ground and air target will happily be locked on a heavily armored, slow, long-winding pathed vehicle while a fast, light aircraft can fly right over it and disappear into the box. Obviously air-only towers are supposed to help in such a situation, but with the tree-stupidity one might need more ground-targetting towers  -and therefore occupy slots - than is good for air-cover. That said, the flak seems to be nicely powerful if upgraded :-)\n\n- Connected with the previous issue: you only get very few and FIXED tower placement points. That means you have to think very carefully where to place which type and even more ANTICIPATE how they will interact on ANY target of any level (AND MIXES thereof) to make "sure" you don't hit only trees because your towers got stuck in a bad timing loop and misses every window of opportunity just to fire at the next tree.\n\n- You can't place or upgrade towers while paused, that means you (and your hardware!) better be fast enough!\n\nand the HORRID:\n\n- scrolling: You can only scroll by cursor keys and they produce mega-leaps instead of managable shifts so half of the time you end up not seeing the view you want but half of it. (I play it in lowest resolution if that makes any difference). Simple standard scrolling with mouse at borders or dragging the map with middle mouse button hold would fix this!\nAlso, sometimes the view scrolls away without user input, maybe due to arriving vehicles or selection of towers (that are fully in view, btw!) and messes everything up even more.\nAlso, because of the scroll issues, make sure that you look at the whole map zoomed out to not miss any available tower placement spots!\n\n","November 28, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Getting through the levels is one thing, getting through with a perfect score is another, but can be done after tweaking and many attempts.
