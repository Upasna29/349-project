You can attach it to both other vehicles and trees.\n+ Attaching a crane to your truck, to pick up lumber, move rocks out of the way and sometimes to help push the truck up.\n+ The game is very well optimized.\n+ Trucks take damage, and consume fuel. You can install a utility addon for mobile repairs, or a fuel cistern for re-fueling in the field.\n+ Patch released on 27/10 -14 added wheel support.\n+ Patch released on 27/10 -14 added analogue controller input.\n+ Patch implemented individual saves for all maps. Big plus in my book.\n\nNegative:\n- The camera could be much better. With the tallest addons it can be a real challenge to see ahead.\n- Maps could be more varied. It's mostly the same mix of grass, trees, mud and water.\n- The only official objective is to haul lumber. More variety would be welcome.\n- Lack of proper manual shifting.\n- Draw distance should be customizable.\n\nWith all that said... As a VIP backer on the kickstarter campaign, and having had access to the beta since May 9, I can safely recommend this game to anyone with an interest in off-roading. If you've tried the tech demo, you know what to expect. Just think bigger; more trucks, more functionality and much bigger maps. All in all, even in beta, this is perhaps the most fun I have had in a realistic off-road game so far. Try the tech demo first; if you like it - there's a safe bet that you will enjoy the full game.\n\nThe devs seem committed to continuing to improve the game after launch, both with free updates and dlc packs later on.\n\nCheck out this link for planned changes to the game: http://www.oovee.co.uk/forum/topic/9056-dev250814-information-on-updates-and-more/","May 31, 2014","true","44.8"," 3,084 of 3,253 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","084","3","0","80"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/philosijoe/recommended/263280/","philosijoe","Philosijoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/philosijoe/","53 products in account","THERE IS A TECH DEMO AVAILABLE FOR FREE, GET IT HERE; http://www.spintires.com/#!/demo . I highly recommend that you download and try it before purchasing, purely because you may find that you don't get on with the game for one reason or another. The download file is only about 100 Mb, so there's really no excuse not to try it. That said, the tech demo is quite different from the actual release. However, if you like the concept of the demo enough to pay for the release, then, in all probability, you won't be dissapointed.\n\nI think that Spintires could be accurately described as quite a devisive game, that is to say that you'll probably either really like it, or find it the most mind numbing tedium you've ever experienced in gaming. It's like Marmite, you'll either love it, or you'll hate it.\n\nPersonally, I love it. The games that I tend to enjoy most are those that afford you a great deal of freedom to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. in short, I love sandbox games. I think that Spintires could be described as a sandbox, admittedly all you can do is drive around in some mud, but you're free to choose the vehicle you want to use, the modifications for that vehicle, the direction you drive said vehicle in, create challenges for yourself and so on. If, like me, you're into your sandbox games then I highly recommend that you try it. I find it a great game to finish an evening's gaming with. It helps to wind me down from explosions, guns, violence and high levels of intensity commonly found in games (at least the games I play) these days. Put your favourite album on, play half an hour of this game and you should be pretty chilled out.\n\nIn terms of actual content, there are seven different vehicles, ranging from a little jeep, to a massive eight-wheeled leviathan of a machine, each with customisable features, such as trailers and tyres, and five different maps. Each map is about 1 Km squared. This may not sound like an awful lot of space to play with, especially if you're into your sandbox games, but the nature of the landscape is such that the challenge is more or less constant and you're not often moving with a great deal of speed. For example, if you make a journey across one of the more challenging maps with a trailer full of the medium sized logs, without any hitches, then it'll probably take you about fifteen to twenty minutes. I have never felt like I wanted bigger maps. That said, dont expect much aesthetic variety between maps, they all look very similar, broadly speaking. However, as I have said, some maps are certainly harder to navigate than others. In terms of what there is to do, it really depends on how inventive and creative you are as a gamer. If you like to stick to the formal objectives of a game, that is, what the game is explicitly telling you to do, then you'll be sorely dissapointed. The objective on each of the five maps is the same, unlock all of the cloaked areas, discover and unlock all of the vehicles present on the map, discover and unlock all the garages on the map, and deliver timber from the lumber mill to the objective. That's it in terms of formal missions. That said, getting your first load of lumber to the mill is incredibly satisfying. On par with landing on the moon for the first time in Kerbal Space Programe (KSP players will know what I'm talking about). If you're more creative and create your own challenges then you'll get a lot more mileage out of this game, for example, driving across one of the maps without using all wheel drive in the UAZ. If you're an experienced sandbox gamer then you'll get far more mileage (literally) out of this game.\n\nI have to put in a word for the aesthetic appeal of this game. In my opinion, Spintires is one of the most beautiful games I have in my library, although I'm aware that there are others who hold the contrary position (beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all). The graphics are quite unique, they have an almost tilt-shift kind of thing going on (if you don't know what that is, google it, I guarantee you'll like what you see, no, it's not boobs). They're almost kind of stylised. The look of the vehicles and the environment do an incredible job of creating this wonderful Russian ambience.\n\nThe physics, on the whole (I'm looking at you, magical jumping rocks) are stellar. The ground deformation (in most cases) is reliable and beautiful to look at. I can safely say that I am not aware of any other game that has done it as well as Spintires has. The water is also amazing. It looks gorgeous driving through it, having it splash around your truck, rather than being this inert entity in the game world. The suspension on all the vehicles is awesome, as is the tyre deformation. It legitimately looks like your vehicle is driving over what it is supposed to be driving over (or through, on some particularly bad roads you'd be hard pressed to say that you were actually driving on the road). Trees shake as you bump into them, flex as you anchor you winch to them and pull, saplings bend and snap as you drive over them. If you like physics games, or games that do physics well, and can justify buying a game on those grounds then I'd recommend picking this up. If you like BeamNG Drive or Next Car Game for their physics, then you'll like Spintires (but not because of the soft body physics, I hasten to add. The soft body physics are perhaps the only aspect of the physics in Spintires which may be considered to be deficient).\n\nOn top of this the game runs (in my experience) very well indeed. I'm not particularly well versed in performance and optimisation, so I cant say much here, but what I can say is that this game runs considerbaly better than you might think. I do all my gaming on my Lenovo Z585 Ideapad, so I'm running it on an AMD Radeon 7660G + 76070M dual graphics card, 8GB of RAM, and a quad-core processor, running on Windows 8. It's a less than ideal gaming setup, but it's the best that I can justifiably afford. I can run Spintires with everything at maximum and get a (fairly) solid 30 frames per second, often higher. So for those of you like me out there with low-powered rigs, then spintires is probably a game you can enjoy in all it's glory. Again, if you're having reservations based upon doubts about how well it'll perform, get the tech demo (link at top of review, it's free).\n\nMost of what I've said so far has been positive, however, there are a couple of negatives. Don't expect frequent updates. Even the updates that there have been really have not changed much. This is probably down to Oovee being such a small studio. Also (I can't verify this, since I've not played the multiplayer), apparently you can't save your progress in multiplayer, once you quit the game, all the work and cool stuff you are your friends pulled off is gone. On the subject of saving, there are no quicksaves. You can't roll up to a river and quicksave just in case you don't make it across. It's do or die. For some this may be incredibly frustrating. For me, however, I tend to find that the absense of a quicksave feature forces me to play much more carefully and methodically. It gives real weight to challenges, and provides a genuine sense of achivement when you overcome an obstacle. I can see why people may not like this, but personally, it's a feature who's ommission I am pleased with.\n\nSo overall, I'd say Spintires is a great, unique, solid game. But get the tech demo and decide for yourself. Oh, a word of warning, if you buy Spintires because you liked the tech demo and expect lots of new features and a good deal more 'game' then you're going to be dissapointed. If on the other hand you're infatuated with the tech demo and want some more trucks and maps to play with then you'll be delighted.\n\nTL;DR, Get the tech demo and decide for yourself (link at top of review).\n\nThanks for reading, hope this helped :).","October 30, 2014","true","46.9"," 1,007 of 1,080 people (93%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","93","007","1","19","39"

Awesome vehicles, a solid assortment of vehicles with awesome add-ons to change up on the trucks to suit any situation whether it be needed for hauling, repairing, fueling or just plain Sunday cruising. Awesome terrain with water crossings, narrow timber bridges, hill climbs, dirt roads, muddy roads, tarmac roads or why not make your own road. It can be a logistical nightmare whilst doing long hauls on your own whilst having to consider damaging your vehicle, low fuel and just plain getting lost but with multiplayer being implemented it is sure to be the perfect package.\nIf you are like me and love driving, driving games or even off-roading in real life then this is the game for you.

It shouldn't have left Early Access.\n\nWhen I started playing it (March '15) it was already out of it and therefore supposedly a full release.\n\nI dipped my toes in every map and made some progress here and there, until one day they released an update and I found out my 20-something hours worth of advances had been wiped out with it.\n\nLooking around in the forums, it soon became apparent that it wasn't just me nor was this the first time it happened. In fact it happened with every single update done before. Others had lost much more time than I did.\n\nThis would be excusable were the game in alpha/beta stage or even still Early Access and things were getting ironed out. Or if it was a 'rogue-like' or 'casual' game. Instead, this is the Dark Souls of truck driving games (set in some kind of deserted Russian Woodstock) and saving your progress is not something to dream about but a fundamental feature that is already there and works. Well, until they do another update.\n\nTo be clear, I'm speaking of the single player aspect of the game only, as multiplayer has no saving options to date.\n\nIrked out, I forgot about it for some time, and came back a while later. This time I didn't split my attention on several maps, aware of the risk it would all go down the drain at any point. Soon enough came another update, and down the drain those extra few hours did go.\n\nIn the wake of complaints in the forums, I remember reading an announcement by Oovee stating they would be having a meeting with the developer (I paraphrase) and would 'explain to him how important maintaining the saved game progress across updates seemed to be to the players'. Which to me is nothing short of fascinating. That such a basic and obvious priority needs to be told to a developer. Over a future meeting, no less.\n\nToday, about half a year later, came another update and, unsurprisingly, another wipe. Wonder how that meeting went.\n\nIf you're on the fence and somehow stumble upon this, consider it a heads up that shouldn't get you out of the fence anyway, because I actually think the game is great, and it is perfectly playable as long as you don't wait too long to pick up where you left. The longer you wait, the higher the chance you'll have to start from scratch.\n\nI'll update the direction my two cents are spinning if I ever become aware of this issue getting resolved. As it stands, Spintires suffers from a lack of respect for its players' time.","October 28, 2015","false","52.3"," 899 of 1,154 people (78%) found this review helpful 76 people found this review funny","78","899","1","76","45"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/263280/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Spintires is a game about driving a truck across the countryside extremely slowly. Your truck is very heavy and the ground is very soft, almost constantly sucking your wheels downwards into its boggy brown mess, threatening to immobilise you in its wet earthy clutches.This isn't the sort of off-road simulator that's accompanied by an electric guitar riff and a cool man doing a wheely over a bush. No, it's slow and thoughtful off-roading. Progress is measured in feet per minute rather than miles per hour. This is hard work.\n\nThe real star of the game is the mud. It is, without a doubt, the best virtual sludge in games. The way your tires dig into it, and the way it deforms realistically as you move through it, is really impressive. The heavier your vehicle is, the more it sinks into it, and the more likely you are to get stuck. Clumps gather on your wheels as you drive, and some areas are so caked in the stuff that you'll be forced to find another route. It's a game of feet, not miles—of dragging your bouncy flatbed through just one more exhausting mire of mud and rocks to reach the safety of a garage or refueling station.\n\nBut you will get stuck, eventually, and that's where vehicle-switching comes into play. There are simple objectives, like picking up and delivering lumber, but it's the journey itself where the real challenge lies, and you'll need some help to heave your oversized load across the uncompromising landscape. After accidentally burying my lumber truck in a thick slurry, I pulled the map up with F1, switched to a nearby truck with a winch and yanked myself out. You can jump freely between vehicles on your own if you're playing solo, or team up with up to three other people in multiplayer.\n\nYour garage is filled with an array of vehicles to plough through the mud in, including nimble jeeps that are good for scouting the area ahead. They can cut through forests and wave between trees, allowing them to uncover the 'fog of war' that initially obscures the map and reveal wider roads and trails for your big haulers to squeeze through. There are trucks with articulated trailers, and big chunky ones that look like they've been rusting in the Chernobyl exclusion zone for the last thirty years. The muted colour palette, bleak overcast skies, and ageing Soviet machinery remind me of the STALKER games—as does the feeling of being constantly at war with your environment.\n\nAs you chew through the mud, the vehicles feel genuinely heavy and unwieldy. The physics are excellent, creating a nice distinction between the big rigs and the smaller trucks. You'll hear your engine heave and groan as you tackle a steep incline or muddy patch, its exhausts belching black smoke as it struggles to escape the sticky gunk. They all feel like real machines, with trailers that bounce and rattle as you trundle over uneven ground. Rocks are kicked into the air by your tires, saplings bend when you rumble over them, and water froths as you ford rivers and carve through puddles.\n\nYou can choose between casual and hardcore mode, although 'casual' will be hardcore enough for most people. Fuel consumption is increased in hardcore, and routes you chart on the map won't be displayed as a guide on the road as you drive. One of the most mystifying omissions is the lack of any kind of cockpit or in-car view. You're stuck with a weird over-the-shoulder (trucks don't have shoulders, but you know what I mean) view that's more Resident Evil 4 than truck simulator. You can move the camera around with the mouse, but in larger rigs your view is often obscured, making getting across narrow bridges and through tight trails a nightmare.\n\nBut here's my problem with Spintires. As amazing as the physics and deformable mud are, that's really all the game has going for it. Its scope is incredibly limited, to the point where it feels like an Early Access release. The missions, whether it's the lumber delivery I talked about earlier, unlocking new vehicles hidden around the world, or revealing the map by driving near 'cloaking' points, are uninspiring. How long you'll stick with the game depends on how compelling you find those ponderous, muddy drives between objective markers. It's an achingly slow, fiddly game, and you'll need a lot of patience to endure the hardships you'll encounter as you traverse the game's five maps.\n\nStill, endurance is what Spintires is all about, and there's a lot of satisfaction to be had in besting the brutal Russian terrain in your hardy little Soviet truck—but not after a lot of rolling over, getting inescapably lodged in soggy riverbeds, and running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. I love that games like this exist. It's why I love PC gaming. But as endearingly bizarre as I find Spintires, and as much as I admire the technology, I can't say I really ever enjoyed it. There are moments of what I could loosely call excitement—like almost rolling over and spilling my load just metres from the delivery point, or thinking I was crossing a shallow pond only to become totally submersed in a river—but they're few and far between. Mostly I just find myself swearing at mud.","November 15, 2015","true","49.4"," 226 of 272 people (83%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","83","226","272","32","6"

Yes the terrain deformation is fantastic, until you realize all you'll be doing in this game is getting stuck in this OP mud as soon as you carry any load. This isn't an off-road simulator, its a winching simulator because all you do is get stuck in mud. There is no rock crawling or technical off-roading where you have to worry about articulation or angles, just mud. The devs found how to make cool mud in video games and just put it everywhere. I remember during a YouTube live stream the devs admitted they never actually had any off-roading experience. This should have been a red flag for me and IT SHOULD BE A RED FLAG FOR YOU, because it definitely shows in the game.\n\nFurthermore, this is still nothing more than a glorified tech demo at its current stage. There is VERY little to do in it. Maybe if they continue to update this with more things to actually do it will be worth the price, but in its current form I feel like I wasted $26 (I got it on sale) on the same game that was a free demo a few months ago, with the addition of moving logs... Yippie. Unless there are some MAJOR content updates for this game, save your money and get the free demo, because you really won't be missing out on anything at this point.\n\nThis is a great physics engine but the people behind SP should give the rights to a studio that can make an actual video game with it.\n\nEdit: just to be clear, this review is coming from someone with 45+hrs on Euro Truck Sim 2 and 100+hrs on Microsoft Flight Sim X. I can appreciate a good sim/casual/therapeutic/whatever game.

We both select the 8 wheel monster unimog. I start it up, a gritty deep pumping sound echoes as I kick her into gear, A billow of black diesel smoke bursts from the stacks... nothing like the smell of rollin coal in the mornin... off we go.\n\nJournal Entry 2\n\nAfter pitting ourselves against a few easy mud holes we decide to cross the roaring river. My buddy goes first, boom he drives off the shore and nose dives into the river, he takes a small amount of damage from water getting in his intake. The current is smashing up against his truck but due to the trucks weight its not going anywhere. My turn, I take a more gentle approach and kinda softly lay the front end into the water and creep across, this approach allowed the truck to level out more gently and keep the intake above water. Once we emerged from the other side the mud was mostly washed off the tires revealing the thick gnarly tread.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nMy buddy has finally met a mud hole that bested his truck, He is up to his windows in a pit of mud, spinning his tires and tossing large chunks of earth every which way.... "Your gonna have to give me a push" he says.... ok here we go.... I slam it into gear and plow ahead through the soupy mud, im not getting much speed but this should be enough.... WAM! I smack right into his rear end pushing his truck enough to give it some traction, he just barely crawls out.... but now we have a problem.... I'm now wedged in his previous position ...stuck... for a quick second all this could remind me of was curling..... one rock bumps out the other...\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nI spun, locked and unlocked my diffs, ripped and turned leaving a horrid gouge in the ground... take that mother nature... My buddy decided to try and hit me from the side but his efforts have now landed onto his side and unable to move....crap... Luckily him hitting me allows some movement, after about 15-20 mins of slowly grinding my truck inch by inch through the mud backwards I am able to get traction on the bank and dig out. Now I gotta get my buddy turned back on his wheels.. I loop around and try to ram his side to knock him upright.... well... I miss calculated a hill during my trajectory... my truck flips over on its side literally facing my buddies window.... now were looking directly at each other flipped over on our sides in almost like a mirror image.... "hi" he says..... we both burst out laughing.... RESTART!\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nAfter starting over we have now taken on the roles of loggers, we rig out our trucks with large cranes and a short jeep trailer behind us. We start trekking north in search for the lumber we need to collect and haul back. Along the way we come across another viscous mud hole, my buddy charges forward and boom stuck.... I run up behind him to push and also bottom out... darn were both stuck.... now what? ... Well these handy dandy self loading trucks are able to dispense their hydrolic crane arms! We both pull out our crane rigging and begin to push and heave into the ground, their is so much power that the crane easily lifts the truck out of the mud, we fiddle around pushing each other and spider walking our trucks through the mud until we are free.\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nIts finally nighttime, The trucks headlights kick in and shine gloriously off the dark trees and lighting up the old overgrown roads. Our truck's rigging smashes and clangs as we run over large rocks and trees, the whole feeling is very rugged and industrial. We finally arrive at our destination, a small logging camp with piles of timber already processed and waiting to be loaded. We are both far too tired after the long drive, time to head for bed and load up our trailers in the morning ;)","June 13, 2014","true","37.3"," 81 of 114 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","81","114","0","7"

It does have a few bugs, but those are over-shadowed by the fun that can be had playing a game with friends. Just when you think you've got a map or a route figured out, everything can and may go wrong. You may have taken a trail a few dozen times before without fault, then suddenly find your truck buried in the mud or worse yet, rolled onto it's side, dumping your load of lumber in the process. I keep playing it for the unpredictability inherent in such a game. You just never know how the game will play out. You may complete a game without fail or you may fail, fail and fail again.

I have listed complaints as suggestions to the developers.\nMultiplayer Complaints\nRandom people join games and you cannot kick them if they are annoying.\nIf the server crashes, then you loose connectivity on the client (well kinda obvious) but you also loose all progress (hours of work)\nThere is no saving multiplayer.\nMultiplayer depends on the steam networking (i.e. you must be signed into steam)\nAll Multiplayer vehicles of the same type spawn on top of each other, causing damage to vehicles due to collisions when you drive away\nThere is no mechanism to drive another players vehicle\nRejoining a game that you disconnected from  (i.e. game crash) requires you to unlock all acheivements again (even if the server has stayed online).\nIf another player switches trucks, it dissapears. If they switch back it reappears, even if you are driving on top of it.\nComplaints for the Game in General\nWhile the destructible mesh is great, and its really cool it remembers the form of destruction along with the heightmap, dont you think that its a little too much mud? Very far on the unrealistic side coming from a person who worked logging in the mountains. Spring runnoff only causes so much mud. Also while there are some awesome 3 meter mudholes, not every mudhole needs to be that deep. Realistically there should be a mechanism to dump pebbles into a mudhole, or more appropriatly sacrifice some poorly tapered logs to the worst mudholes.\nThere needs to be a visible minimap, and perhaps a cab driving perspective (preferably with secondary cameras on each side showing the tire position). If you want to go for realism, only the drivers side.\nGear shifting mechanics need to be adjusted (I dont know about Russian trucks, but many of this era truck had spider gears, or at least more than 3 gears). Furthermore the gear transitions are mouse based and non granular, this is problematic.\nWhat exactly is the crane for? It cant seem to move the trucks, nor pickup logs. Kinda cool, but wished it did something.\n\n\n","June 16, 2014","false","21.8"," 133 of 215 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","133","215","0","4"

You'll need it, plan or drive poorly and you'll be rewarded with a mouthful of mud/water and trying again.\n\nThere are repair trucks, refueling trucks, winch/rescue trucks and loading cargo trucks some even with their own fully operable cranes. There are also smaller scout vehicles like jeeps for mapping and finding the points of interest. Escort your delivery trucks with the needed support vehicles to ensure they arrive safely at their destination. The game support mulitplayer sessions as well and this is where it really shines, allowing you to form offroad convoys with your friends and help each other out, each person filling a needed roll in the convoy.\n\nIts sandbox style maps allow you to go anywhere and do anything at any time. My only gripe is the game lacks a traditional save/load feature. It saves continously and automatically saves as you play and you can quit at any time and can continue later where you left off. But you can't save half way through an attempted delivery or before a risky maneuver and then reload if things go horribly wrong (which they frequently do). This means if you screw up, you have to either reset your vehicle and try again or attempt to winch yourself out of trouble and continue the fight. This can be both intensely frustrating or satisfying if you're really hardcore about it. It certainly teaches you to be careful and not drive with reckless abandon. Regardless, there needs to be an option for it IMO.\n\nThe devs have promised regular updates and content additions in the following months which is good and we'll see. But for a kickstarter backed, small dev project it's remarkably polished and delivers alot of offroad driving pleasure.\n\n8.5/10 overall","June 14, 2014","true","152.1"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","2"

You need to fight the mud every step of the way, and the smaller your truck and the heavier your load, the more difficult it gets. There are ruts in the dirt, your trucks will leave ruts in the dirt, you will get stuck in mud, in boggy soil (it's ok if you go fast, but as soon as you slow down...), in loose soil, on rocks, and in the rivers, lakes and puddles (don't go in to deep, the water has it in for you as well). You will tip over and spill your load, then winch yourself back upright and pick the logs up with a crane. You will repair and refuel yourself and others. You will slip off a rough log bridge carrying a heavy load. You will snag on tree stumps and logs. You will bump against trees and waltz over them.\n\nIt's you and your truck against the terrain.\n\nIf you think that's boring, don't buy.\n\ndownload the demo[spintires.com]\n\n\nBe aware though, some people have complained that the game plays "too much like the demo", i.e. they imagined features from the demo that the game doesn't have currently.\n\nThere's no tutorial, no career system, just maps and trucks and mud, and you can deliver lumber and load it with a crane, and you get achievements, some of which are challenges that may take you awhile to master. You get 5 maps in the game (I find them sufficiently diverse, even if certain terrain features like pieces of track are copied & pasted), you get 7 trucks, and different tires and equipment for most. There are a lot of mods hosted on the official site and others, but so far installing them means messing with the game files; I expect support for that will be here before the end of the year, but you might not be able to use them in multiplayer.","October 29, 2014","true","742.0"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","43","61","6","1"

What this is instead is still the glorified tech demo with a "game" sprinkled (poorly) over the top.\n\nWhile this game is pretty, and the physics are impressive, this isn't a foundation for a full game.\n\nI've never encountered a driving game with a "fog of war" style mechanic, and a game that focusses on difficult, technical driving makes this massively frustrating.  If this is trying to be a simulator, I can't possibly imagine anyone driving off road without a map and a plan of the terrain or route they're wanting to follow.  Realistically, on any level, the first "objective" is to clear all the fog of war, just so you can see the damned map and where you're going to do the main objective.\n\nThe driving is also frustratingly slow primarily due to the vast amount of mud and mud deformation used which will bog down nearly any vehicle incredibly quickly and the constant rescuing/winching rapidly grows tiresome.  While this is an off-roading game, even the "main" roads are rutted so heavily that any form of progress is also painfully slow.  The mud is also so prevalent that there is no reason to ever turn off the all-wheel drive or the diff-locks as it's virtually impossible to make any real progress with these turned off.\n\nThe vehicles that i've encountered so far include a small jeep, which will also get stuck incredibly easily and even on the main roads, a rear-wheel-drive only truck which again gets stuck far too easily, and several larger 6 and 8 wheeled trucks that you'll end up using for pretty much everything, including basic scouting.\nVehicles can be customised to a basic extent with the addition of repair kits or additional fuel tanks which can then be used on the truck to which they are applied, or to other nearby trucks.  The fuel tank add-ons are incredibly annoying as the basic garages at which you select the upgrades, and of which there are generally only one or two on a map, do not fill these fuel tanks.  Instead, you must take these tanks to a dedicated fuelling station which are usually a long distance from the starting garages and again assume that you've removed the fog of war on the map to actually see where they are and so you can plan a route to them.  Worse is that the main objectives of lumber delivery usually has you travelling a long way to get from the starting garage to the lumber yard, and then an incredibly long way to the final delivery point.  This distance is usually so great that it's impossible to do this journey on a single tank of fuel.\n\nWhile on the subject of objectives; Fog of War only removes at specific map locations and there are approximately 10 of these points per map.  Garages require special points to unlock which are in the form of an upgrade to a truck that acts as a "load" that needs to be delivered which i've found to take 2 journeys to unlock (I realise there is a larger trailer that should do it in one journey, though again this gets stuck far too often), and the main lumber delivery objective which as far as i've encountered, also requires two full journeys to complete.\n\nA typical playthrough of a level will consist of: starting, driving forward 10 yards and getting stuck, turning on the all-wheel drive, and the diff-locks and then leaving them on for the remainder of the game.  Next, open the map, set a market for one of the fog of war checkpoints, head towards it and promptly get stuck, faff around for a while trying to get unstuck, get within 100 metres of the checkpoint only to find there's no access from that direction, try and go around, get stuck, more faffing, eventually find the checkpoint, get stuck or roll over just outside the specific zone required, faff trying to rescue the vehicle, reset, start again.  Repeat this for each of the checkpoints and then try and do similar for the actual "main" objective.\n\nGenerally the vehicles control reasonably well; there's a weight and momentum to vehicles, although a frustrating and clumsy camera system makes it very difficult to properly see what's going on in certain situations.\n\nTL:DR?\n\nPros:\n\nPretty visuals\nGood vehicle physics\n\nCons:\n\nNo actual gameplay, still just a tech demo / showcase for mud deformation\n"Fog of War" for map in a game emphasising navigation\nVehicles get stuck far too easily","June 15, 2014","false","9.5"," 140 of 229 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","140","229","0","7"

The graphics in this game are  INSANELY  nice looking!\n-The developers have done an amazing job with the physics of the trucks; I love the "heavy" feeling of the vehicles.  Each truck handles differently than each other, and each one has its own challenges to overcome!\n-Every single part on the vehicles seems to be animated, from the suspension to the chains and hooks.\n-Immense customization for each vehicle, you can make a whole fleet of loggers, tankers and rescue trucks!\n-A nice array of maps to choose from, with the ability to  choose starting vehicles.  Each map is extremely well made!\n-The developers have made literally EVERYTHING on the map interactive; from the deformable terrain (you will hate mud after you finish playing for a while), to rocks, trees, and bushes!\n-A nice career feel to the game, with you having to first go ahead and scout to remove cloaking from the map, as well as find paths to fuel stations and lumberyard/objectives.\n-Trucks burn fuel at different levels depending on each model, and whether dif lock and AWD are enabled.\n-Controls are very easy to set up, and are simplistic from the beginning.\n-The game really requires you to think about the route you are taking, in order to not cause damage to your truck or load.\n-An excellent group of devs as well as a phenomenal community of modders!\n\nReason the game could be better: -The ONLY complaint I have that would make the game better would be an interior camera.  The camera options as of now leave a lot to be desired, and make it very difficult to see at some points.\n\nOverview All-in-all, the pros of this game FAR outweigh the cons, and there is absolutely NO reason not to buy this game!

After all I get easily frustrated and angry when I get my car stuck in the snow. But I find SPINTIRES delightful and satisfying from how much hard work it forces you to put into it.\n\nSPINTIRES is a game that puts you in the middle of some isolated forest or marsh, and your goal is to deliver logs from the lumber yard to the mill. Sounds straightforward.\nHowever, the terrain will prove to be your biggest obstacle. Most 'roads' are nothing more than muddy trenches, destinations sit at the top of steep hills, and it will become necessary to haul logs and trailers through rivers...which may end in disaster. Fortunately, you have some pretty hefty trucks at your disposal, a couple of which can barrel over smaller trees with no problem.\n\nThe aforementioned satisfaction comes from trudging through the mud and reaching your destination with your load intact. There's a wonderful sense of accomplishment when you get your vehicle stuck and manage to winch yourself to a tree and pull yourself out.\n\nThe physics SPINTIRES is something to boast about. The terrain changes under your tires, depending on the vehicle you're operating; mud gets kicked up, roads get chewed up, small bridges might collapse under your weight.\nYou can play more casually by respawning your vehicle to an unlocked garage or not have to worry about shifting gears manually. But there is a hardcore mode where respawning is disabled, providing a more realistic experience; if your vehicle is stuck submerged in a river, you need a bigger truck to pull it out.\n\nEven so, at the start of each level your traveller's map will be covered in black spots. To uncover these, for better or for worse, you need to drive to the source of these spots to remove the cloaking. This promotes more aggressive exploration, though this is more of a negative than a positive for some players, as there is no option to have the entire map visible.\n\nThere is a multiplayer option in SPINTIRES as well as steering wheel support, though there are many people who have had issues with both lately. Briefly glancing through forums, there might be some fixes that can clear up these issues, but hopefully the developers will look into the problems quickly and patch them out.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend SPINTIRES. I've sunk a lot of hours into delivering logs across a marsh and walked away feeling satisfied and very entertained. Sounds strange, but, if you give it a try, you might be surprised at how fun it can be.","December 1, 2014","true","37.5"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","38","55","0","0"

Most realistic off road game there is currently.\n. The graphics are beatiful and the fact you can alter the terain is stunning.\n. The game runs well on lower spec PC's.\n. Multiplayer gameplay is very enjoyable and awarding at the same time.\n. Map designs are fantastic.\n. The crane system at first is very confusing however once you get the hang of it, it's very enjoyable experience.\n. Sounds are very realistic and fantastic.\n\nNegatives.\n\n. There are glitches in the game which I have personally experienced, theses range from missing one of my rear dulley wheels, managing to flip over the biggest and heaviest truck in the game while towing one of the smaller trucks, and lastly having my medium load come off my trailer however didn't break down and was stuck to my trailer, which In the end I had to get another trailer. Will note theses are rare occurrences and I have only experienced theses issues once.\n.  The fact you can not load your fellow online players or friends with logs via the crane due to the logs being clicent based and not sever based.\n. Online games seem to have alot of leavers when games are starting.\n. Must have a good internet connect to host severs or objectives will not count.\n. Feels that the game isn't quite finished yet.\n\nWorthy mentions.\n\n. Having more content and maps in the game.\n. Having a more advance weather system, rain, snow, thunder and lighting.\n. Seems that the dev team seem to be slow on updates and news.\n.  Some maps have certainly similarities example some roads and off road tracks but most maps do make up for this.\n. There is an modding scene however I havn't experienced so I can not make a comment however what I have heard it's ment to be amazing. All I know if you mod your game you can not go on to muliplayer for the time being.\n. Camera view takes some time to get use to but expecting updates for this in the near future.\n\nSummary.\n\nOveral I think the game is an very enjoyable experience and since currently it's the only game type of this kind I would say give it a try, however knowing that there are still  issues and the lack of content might put a few people off, however even if you are not a fan of driving simulators which might change your opinion. A must is if you know or can get friends to buy this game aswell it will totally transform the game and lead to many hours of enjoyment. If you are still not sure wheather or not you want to purchase Spin tires I would highly reccomend spending a few moments on youtube of game play and possiblely modding if that floats your boat.","October 6, 2014","true","267.1"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","41","61","3","0"

What a great game.\nDon't believe the doom merchants. This is original & different. You don't even need a killer PC to run it.  I never thought driving simulated trucks in the  mud could be so much fun. Plenty here to keep interest for many hours. Then theres the mods! Maybe one day the devs may finish it! But even if they don't this is well worth your brass as it is. I never reviewed anything before but this game doesn't seem to have had a fair chance.\nFirst the forests. Beautiful & just like a Russian forest should be. Only thing no bears. Yes I have been there & it looks just right. Makes you want to pick mushrooms..... Shame to despoil it by driving over trees really ;-)\nThe veachles drive as you would expect that they would. I've driven heavy forestry machines in this country. And a wide variety of heavy tracktors & all wheel drives. Some here some in Russia. The ones that are comparable are great. Low ground pressure tyres do not grip so well on tarmac, Maybe a bit more road noise on tarmac would be more realistic but you can't have everything. Physics very good for the big trucks. The smaller 4x4's bounce too much. Like they don't have dampers. But thats really nit picking.\nSounds are fantastic. Engines roaroing. Mud flying. Water foaming. Then when you've turned the thing over. You can listen to the birds & admire the sunrise. Pity you didn't see the narrow bridge in the dark till it was too late........\nWhat's not to like. Probaly we have to wait for Spintires 15 for perfection but this will do for now.\nI can even play it with my kids on my knee as there are nothing to give them nightmares.\nThey say there are bugs. But in a few hours game play I have only once had a truck that got confused about it's diff lock. Recovering it to a garage fixed it.  Snow would be nice. If you havn't seen Russia in the snow you havn't lived. Bit hey theres a mod for that! Morning mists are good.\nA lot of fun for big kids like me. Pleasantly surpriced by this one. Usually I get something that won't run on my PC in sale.....Well worth a tenner or thereabouts.  Makes a change from killing things..........\nBuy it on sale & see for your self.\nEdit,  After playing this again after a break you can see the developement. The little uaz no longer bounces along & is more real. Quite a number of small improvements that add to the imersion. Some new maps. Still no mod support in multiplayer though the devs havn't given up on this & it will come eventually. A better game than it was when first reviewed & getting better. It's also great value at the current price. Still not seen a bear yet but that doesn't mean there aren't any.... Try it & you will see what I mean....This game requires skill & patience. It is not arcade. If your getting stuck too often then try something different. Don't blame the game!!\n\nJust a quick update. Dec 2015.  Been awhile since I wrote this & the game now has a mod editer. Steam Workshop support & a great many updates. The devs are still working on it & at some point there should be a map editor. It just keeps getting better. I give it a rest for awhile. Come back & it's improved again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnhoff/recommended/263280/","tnhoff","TN Hoff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnhoff/","190 products in account","TL/DR below:  Getting-stuck-in-the-mud simulator.  8.5/10\n\nIn some ways this game may not be considered "complete" - but the important question for me is this: is it fun?  (Is it worth my $30?)  My experience thus far has yielded a definite "yes."  The only "objective" is to pick up logs on one side of the map, and deliver them to another.  Sounds simple, doesn't it?  Even on "casual" mode - this is far more challenging than I thought, and in the best possible way.  If you enjoy carefully navigating heavy vehicles through terrain they have little to no business being on, this game is for you.\n\nMore specifically:\n\nVehicles:  There are a decent variety, and each has a different feel and driving style.  By default, each has different equipment that serves a different function, though many are customizable and each to a different degree.  Mainly, there is the cargo function, and support functions.  Get your favorite truck stuck in the mud or flip it over making a bad turn?  Whip out the heavy slow one and wench it out!  Smash it into a boulder?  Bring in the repair vehicle.  Run out of fuel?  There's a tanker for that.  Just feel like exploring in something faster?  Go find the little jeep thing stuck in the woods.\n\nDriving Mechanic:  Weight plays a huge role in the feel of driving, and once your vehicle is loaded-up, every few yards of movement become a strategic series of decisions.  Should I brave that pile of large rocks or try wading through that pool of uncertain depth?  Is your vehicle sure-footed on 8 wheels but slow as father time - or is it fast as a rabbit but top-heavy like a bobbing-bird?  Seriously - getting stuck in the mud has never been this fun.  The driving feels mostly realistic - certainly enough to suspend my disbelief, and make me feel like I'm really piloting many tons of metal, rubber, and wood through a slimy river-bed.\n\nGraphics / Physics:  This is a beautiful game.  Muddy, swampy, sloshy, beautiful.  Not only is the level of graphical detail very impressive, but the physics and voxel deformation match it in kind.  Tires smoosh under the weight of cargo and deform over rocks.  Mud squishes out of the way of your tires and splatters all over your cabin in higly convincing fashion - and it even slowly dries over time.  Water reacts absurdly well to disturbance and current - this might be the most convincing 3d water I've ever seen in a game.  It isn't perfect - but it's still the best I've ever seen.  As mentioned above, the driving and physics thereof are not perfect, but they are better than most when it comes to off-road - and I've never played a game before this one that accurately portrays the feeling of getting bogged-down in wet river-mud.  Seriously.  This is very convincing gloopyness, and the splatter of mud and splash of water are of higher quality than you're likely to see anywhere else.\n\nGameplay:  This is really all about the experience of driving these machines in this environment - that is: big heavy trucks over packed-dirt, wet grass, rivers and puddles, and of course - mud.  Lots of mud.  There is an objective in each map, and near as I can tell it's always the same - but as I said, that doesn't make it a simple task.  There are also "cloaking points" - which are basically an alternative to "fog of war" that obscure the map, as well as garages and vehicles to discover - and in hardcore mode - to repair, refuel, and reclaim.  Each map is hours of fun.\n\nThat said - my one gripe on the current version of this game is that starting a different map will overwrite the save from another - so until you finish a map, it's best to stick with the one, as you can continue after quitting the game.  However, the developers have explicitly stated this will change in the next update - so hey!  If this sounds like a dealbreaker to an otherwise awesome experience, put this on your wishlist and check back later.  You might want to check the free tech-demo on their website to get an idea what this is like - that's what I did.  I bought the game at full price, and I am not at all disappointed - $30 very well spent, in my opinon.  The technology in the full game has been pushed a lot farther: every aspect feels better, more polished, and more realistic - but the demo will at least give you a feel for whether you will enjoy this style of driving or not.","October 3, 2014","true","22.3"," 59 of 97 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","59","97","0","1"

Unless, of course this is still in open beta. It's hard to tell. I have played the tech demo, it was great, but having paid $30 here on Steam, and realizing that nowhere on Steam does it say this game is still under development, I'm wondering why there isn't a larger difference between the demo and the game. Other than equipment add-ons, I can't see a huge difference. Don't get me wrong, the physics are amazing, the terrain simulation superb (though there's WAY too much mud. I haven't found a single road yet that I didn't sink into, so I drive pretty much everywhere off-road). I've only played about 5 hours so far, so I can't say I've seen everything, but I was hoping to be a little more wowed for the money.\n\nHopefully it's still in development.","June 24, 2014","false","4.4"," 44 of 70 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","44","70","0","2"

At least in casual mode. Anyway, be careful and approach larger bodies of water slowly, because they tend to be deep enough to stall the engine.\n\nThe game is worth its price, the trucks behave realistically in the deep mud (at least for me, who never experienced deeper than my shoes), but I have to mention one thing: camera handling. That's plain terrible. It's sliding from one side of the truck to the other, and you bet that the truck itself will cover half of your monitor any given time, and you can't see where you are going.

AND LETS NOT FORGET THE OFFICIAL MOD SUPPORT UPDATE PROMISED QUITE SOME TIME AGO.\n\nSecond, game gets boring after 10 hours due to lack of any other objective other than "Get logs from here to here". It also suffers from an over-sensitive damage sistem, example: touch a tiny rock with the bottom of your truck at 5mph, get 24 damage (this is bad when most veicules have a max of 500hp and there are tiny rocks EVERYWHERE) and when it's not the tiny rocks it's the small twigs that get you.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nDecent graphics and amazing physics make this game very realistic in terms of mud behaviour (most of the time at least), for example: if you only take the same route over and over the terrain is gonna get harder and harder to move in due to the mud getting boggier and boggier.\n\nSoviet era trucks and military offroaders, what's not to love.\n\nGood level design.\n\nFuel consuption sistem makes it a lot more realistic.\n\nYou can knock down (some) trees.\n\nVEREDICT:\nI've had this game since a month or two after it came out on early access, my play time for such a timespan should give you a hint as to the replayability and capacity to keep you engaged that it has. (granted driving around in the mud, getting stuck from time to time, has it's charm, it's not, however, enough of a foundation to base a game upon, as far as I'm concerned, AND I REALLY LOVE OFFROADING).\n\nThat being said I really hope the devs get their ♥♥♥♥ together because this game has potential, especially with no other half-decent offroaders out right now.\n\nI just cant recomend it in it's current state, especially not at it's full price.","July 12, 2015","false","40.1"," 106 of 185 people (57%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","57","106","185","10","24"

And the only thing you can do in any of those situations, is either to ask for help, or respawn in the nearest base.\n\nPros:\n-Fancy graphics, good amount of detail\n-Easy controls, noob friendly\n-Deformable terrain, water effects are extremelly well done\n-Sound effects are good\n-Variety of vehicles to drive\n\nCons:\n-In multiplayer, it's hard to find a lobby that doesn't lag\n-Gets boring after a few hours(it's basicly the same thing, over and over again)\n-Just 1 objective at the moment, which is, to gather logs and to unload them in the unloading zone.\n-The map is really big, and riding those big, slow trucks gets boring, specially when alone\n-Even tho the map is deformable, I think they exaggerated on the terrain. When i started, it was literally impossible to go further then 5 meters. The whole map is basicly offroad, and there is little to no roads in it.\n-Maps all look the same, terrain is repetitive , and with no details(asides from the trees, grass, water, rocks and sand. No houses/aesthetic feeling)\n\nThis was my honest review on the game. In the hours that i put in this game, i managed to find 3 friendly people that stayed in the server the whole time. I experienced little to no lag(mainly because i was hosting it) . We completed all the tasks. We explored the whole map, and thats basicly it.\n\nTL;DR- It's a good game to kill time, but not the type of game to invest hours upon hours in it.\nIn the state it is, id call it a 7/10.","June 12, 2014","true","4.9"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","26","39","0","2"

While not many maps and vehicles are available the already existing ones give you enough challenge to spend dozens of hours with the game.\n\nThe concept of Spintires is very simple: every map has a location for the lumber you need to deliver elsewhere. This location along with the drop-off point is shown on your map. They are, of course, quite far from each other (usually positioned at opposite ends of the map. The terrain is usually difficult to navigate on so you need to carefully plan where you'd like to go and which vehicle you'd like to take. Additionally, the game does not reveal the map for you - certain "cloaking" areas are placed and in order to get rid of them you need to approach their epicenter.\n\nNavigation requires you to pay attention. Naturally, the best is to play with a friend as in coop mode you can not only deliver more lumber at once but help each other if stuck in the mud.  Respawning is possible but only in casual mode: real challenge begins only for hardcore gamers! Near garages certain extensions can be installed - utility assets are available for repair work and you can install a tank for the fuel to have long-lasting petrol available.\n\nI like the complexity of the game and having translations in many languages is always a plus for me. The game looks nice - especially the water and mud effects look great during interactions with your vehicles. The only downside is the missing sound effects for your friend - you simply do not hear the engine of their car but only your own. And you cannot see their tracks in the mud which would be nice if you go on separate ways only to meet up later on because of the objective.\n\nOverall, I am really satisfied with this game. It has potential and while rumor has it the relationship between publisher and developer is not exactly great with regular updates this game can be even greater!","February 5, 2015","true","35.7"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

First impressions.\n\nFirstly, I am an experienced 4x4 driver of almost 40 years. I lived and worked in some of the harshest conditions Australia has to offer so I came at this from a fairly high level of knowledge. My experience includes HV rescue.\n\n(In this, I'll use the term 4x4 to include the 6 and 8 wheel drives in game for brevity)\n\nGRAPHICS\nReally nice. Modelling is great. My 670gtx on maximum settings sits easily on 60fps with no heat issues.\n\nSOUND\nSome of the trucks sound great, particularly the turbo diesel variant of the C series. It is very loopy however and more often than not a truck on constant acceleration going through a bog sounds like a 500hp Caterpillar with the Jake Brake operating as it shifts down - through every damn gear. It's more akin to a 60t semi-trailer coming down from highway speed at an intersection. (I know, I hear them everynight where I live).  Scene ambience (if you shut down the engine to hear it) is quite nice to listen to.\n\nVEHICLES\nIn my first playthrough, finding all the different vehicles was a buzz. From a little 4WD to 8 wheel drive behemoths. Unfortunatley, once you have the 8 wheelers, pretty well every other truck becomes redundant in casual mode and I ended up just putting a load on 2 trucks, hooking up a tow and completing the objectives towing the second vehicle behind me regardless of terrain with the older 8WD.\n\nCONTROLS\nGame controls can be confusing. Clearly the game was created for XBox controller and instead of providing for additional PC keybinding, a second level key must be turned on then off to use a combined feature.\n\nEG: Turn on V to get winch, connect winch points. I can winch using F but if I want to drive and pull with winch I need to press V again to disable additional  menu.\n\nEG: Gear changes in hardcore. I have to press R, then select gear via a silly graphic. Why not keybinds? A VERY common "debogging" technique is vehicle rocking. (forward <> backwards motion). This is impossible because of this.\n\nCAMERA\nOMG!! Whatever happened to simple rotation on the object with mouse wheel or even button zoom? Again, it feels like this was designed for dual stick controllers and NOT for PC users. Aside from no cabin view, I'm stuck looking down the side of the vehicle to drive. I can press 1 or 2 to change view direction but that's it.\n\nSure, I can click the screen and rotate and zoom in by pushing the mouse forward, right up until an object (eg: a tree) grabs the FOV and changes it. More than once I had a FFS moment trying to work out where to drive to when there were trees close to me etc. Even a flat overhead view would make this sooooo much better.\n\nPHYSICS\nThe excellence in the mud physics and 4WD capabilities of the vehicles in it is sublime. To watch difflock in operation by placing one side of the vehicle on hard ground is awesome. The "catching" you experience with traction pulling on one side is pretty close to authentic.  Climbing out of bogs where front wheels gain traction (or rear in reverse) is right on the money.\n\nTERRAIN\nPersistent in SP and this really makes it interesting. I found myself (largely from RL experience) really making an effort not to chew the tracks up too much. Using some track areas repeatedly eventually required winching/towing to get out where previously I could drive straight through.\n\nSome of the rocks in this game are stupidly big and unrealistic and have been placed quite stupidly (add to the challenge?) in some places such as around entrance roads etc. Including tree placement!\n\nCLOAKING (FOW)\nTrite, simplistic and very poorly done. (dev skills shortfall?). Large black circles requiring driving blind to the middle to unlock an area. Nothing progressive and no reward for doing recon in vast areas until you actually get to the little "cloak vortexes".  An incremental decloak would be soooo much better here or just remove it. It's stupid.\n\nWINCHES\nOh my. Forget chaining up vehicles or doing long snatches out of bogs here. Tiny little cables, no extensions and single winch points. Supposedly it adds to the challenge (that's what they said) but it's so far removed from reality it turns what COULD have been really good fun into a trite -if not frustrating- exercise.\n\nThe short winches just make driving to the sides of tracks a neccessity and no amount of skilfull driving such as best line is allowed. Recovery out of a long bog or river is as good as impossible and the option is to.... rescue to garage (in casual mode).\n\n(I've done rescues at over 150m with triple cabled/chained 4x4's to get semi-trailers out of mud bogs and snatches out of sand dunes with winch extensions - STANDARD FARE in the world of 4WD. Recovery vehicle is ALWAYS hard grounded otherwise it's pointless trying. Duh.)\n\nOVERALL\nA good, fun and casual game with the usual "skill" achievements to unlock, some requiring MP mode to complete (WHY?!)\n\nThe actual driving makes an excellent 4WD simulator but so much of it is extremely arcade in play and really makes a mess of what could have been... brilliant. Too much emphasis on controller and so much of it requires MP to make use of the vehicles in game. Fun as SP but *not* designed specifically for it or around it.\n\n"Casual" is too easy with magic carpet rides to the garage instead of just giving decent recovery tools (which would negate the need for magic carpet rides).\n\n"Hardcore" is  removal of the magic carpet and a stupid difflock on/off system tied to which transmission (M or A) you use!!\n\nIf the camera is ever fixed - and I mean FIXED - the BS they call cloaking is changed/removed and decent winches to make all vehicles much more important (remove the magic carpet ffs),  this would easily get a 9.\n\nAs it stands, I give it a solid 7.5. (buy it on special if you can)\n\nCONCLUSION: If you have 360 controller and don't know what "off-road" is really like, might be a good buy for the fun factor.

After 3-5 hours of playing the game, I started to wish Spintires was a road construction game. Delivering logs could have been more of a plot point. Some logging company sets up shop, they need to set up a decent road network before logs can be moved. They hire you to build the roads. You go from area to area picking up materials and dropping them off where the road construction is. You drive various vehicles and construction equipment to mark the routes, flatten the ground, and remove rocks. Once the road is done, the logging company is able to move logs and you win. You can either deliever logs on your fancy road and enjoy your work, or move on to the next map.\n\nI'm still going to recommend this game, but only to gamers who enjoy choose your own adventure games. What you do and how much fun you have is pretty much up to you. Its a fun game and definitely a techical achievement, but it could have been more. It feels like this is a tech demo with a sprinkle of game added to it. Hopefully the devs land a nice contract for a new game using this tech.","July 10, 2014","true","19.1"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OttoNL/recommended/263280/","OttoNL","OttoNL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OttoNL/","132 products in account","The last update fixed a lot of things for me. It's possible to drive across a river again or through a deep mud pit. I'm not sure if this has been fixed for everybody (not a whole lot of people had these bugs in the first place) but I'm glad it's working here.\nThere seems to be some conflict between dev and publisher again. They can't seem to get the dev to fix certain things and the dev tells people he doesn't know about bugs that the publisher alledgedly did tell him about. All very strange.\n\nOriginal review below might be outdated, but I can say this...\nThe trucks and mud physics are great, but the User Interface is awkward and feels incomplete. No rebinding of keys for 360 controllers and no return-to-center for steeringwheel either, but non-360 controllers don't get all keybinds for some reason and you can't rebind the Gear Shifter and camera controls.\n\nWould I recommend it? I want to vote neutral. I kinda like it, but the quirks can also be royally frustrating. And I'm not sure if I would support (all of) the people behind this game. If you want a well polished product skip this, if you don't care about that this is a pretty good game.\n\n-----\n\nOriginal review:\n\nTypical Early Access game. I know it's just out of Early Access, but if it were up to any respectable company it would just now get into Beta.\n\nBefore I tell you what's all wrong with it I'll tell you how (and if) it redeems itself. If you ask me... No, for most people the problems are way to big if it even runs, but as an offroad enthusiast this is the only interesting game out there that doesn't feel like a racing game with 30% less grip. The trucks (well 3 out of 7), suspensions and mud physics are all pretty amazing! You can actually dig yourself in if you give it too much power for instance.\n\nHowever... These are the problems you'll have to learn to live with if you want this game:\n- The camera! It's impossible to get it to go where you want it to go, so exploring the wilderniss or getting out of a dense forest is nearly impossible while with a good camera it would be very easy.\n- If you use a gamepad other then a 360 controller you can't use the stickshifter. This was not pointed out before purchase. You also can't adjust the camera properly. It's just as bad as with the mouse but 5 times slower.\n- If you use a controller of any kind you still need the keyboard regularly which is awkard. It's understandable that some things need a mouse, but the keys on the keyboard are absolutely unnecessary if they just made the option to bind them as you wish.\n- The game was absolutely broken for 80% of customers for over a week, but it works now for 98% of people.\n- 98% of people don't register to the OOVEE forums. Those people report massive amounts of bugs which will never be adressed, because 'That's their problem.'\n- Lag in online games is usually enormous. But the Client determins how your truck drives, so 90% of the time it's not a huge problem.\n\n- The winch, that you'll need a lot, is super glitchy. It can randomly flip a vehicle that you're towing. Usually works well enough though.*\n- The winch cable is super short.\n- They just removed some winch points\n- No high winch points, so you can't keep it stable on a banked road\n- Winch power is sometimes humongous, sometimes you don't even know you're winching\n- You can only attach to a max amount of trees. This can mean that the 1 tree you need is unavailable.\nIn my own experience this max amount randomly varies from 5 to 15.\n\n- The DRM is very agressive and when you lose the connection with the notoriously instable server your game is closed. You will save SP progress but MP progress will be gone. I have not been able to play for longer then 20 minutes and it takes hours to complete a map.**\n- You can barely drive over small branches. Yes. You can haul lumber, but some vehicles can't get over branches as they have no friction. Wow.***\n- You can't see how to wade through water, because you can't see the bottom. So it's just driving in the river a thousand times and crossing your fingers that you don't need to do 3 hours of progress all over again. It´s realistic, but there should be a way to check like you could in real life with a stick.\n- Unrealistic game-balance measures. For instance if you drive in a straight line on a hard road (also happens on soft roads sometimes) you get damage if you leave Diff-lock enabled. And you stall if you don't switch to second gear fast enough while in real life it could drive away in highest gear while carrying a load. I'm afraid they'll add more of these things as the current publishers don't care about realism.\n\nAnd then there's the Publisher OOVEE. There's a lot of speculation about wether they are respectable or not, all I know for sure is that they don't seem to care about all the aformentioned problems. They only read what's posted on their own forum where maybe 1-2% of customers go and ignore all problems on the Steam forums. They also don't post changelogs there and every update breaks the game for a big portion of the people. They don't tell them how to do a clean install and how to fix the game, so many people just stop playing. This way they choose not to know what problems this game has. Very lazy to say the least. I once complained about the camera control with the gamepad and they sent me a tutorial on how to fix it myself in by programming in Python. They sell a game that's nearly broken and they send us duct tape.\n\nThere's a chance that they'll (I mean their single Russian developer) fix some problems soon, but since they don't know about many problems, I don't expect most problems to ever be fixed. They did say that they were looking into the problem with the branches.\n\nPublishers just told me days ago that they think the game is done. ish. But it will get some minor improvements and tweaks.\n\n* This has now been fixed. Pretty much.\n\n** DRM isn't causing problems for me anymore, but there are some players who still can't play online.\n\n*** This has gotten worse as they completely overhauled the physics. Mud is now softer and Branches don't sink in the mud. So you got a branch you absolutely can't pass except by pushing it out the way if the end of the stick doesn't get caught. If it does it's tough luck.","January 5, 2015","false","167.1"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","34","56","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/263280/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This is a driving / offroad fan's dream game. Ten year old me would have been easily banned from the computer for playing too much while the adult in me has to remind myself I have work in the morning.\n\nSpintires is an offroad open sandbox game complete with 5 maps and about 7-8 different trucks. Now, the idea of it being sandbox may throw some off - but oddly enough there is enough going in this game to keep you busy. The game concept follows around objectives and the process of driving up to garage's and trucks to unlock them. Some (or most) objectives require you to transport certain materials such as lumber. Not all trucks can carry lumber and not all trucks have the attachments to. When starting off at your main garage, players can modify their vehicles by adding utility carts, lights or such other accessories. The trucks that are put into this game are pretty cool and quite dynamic. Some are stuck without all wheel drive while some have differential locks as well as all wheel drive.\n\nTrucks can be as small as a jeep, to as big as a heavy crane truck you would see helping unload construction material near a job site. Some trucks even come with cranes to load and unload lumber! There is, however a draw-back to this awesome inclusion. Typically, you load up your lumber automatically and only if you happen to get into an accident or logs fall out, then you can use your crane to load them up. So the crane does have a use, but can also be seen as useless to some. The driving experience itself is addicting. I'm not sure why, and I'm not sure how, but the challenge of ripping through dirt road, water, mud, even rolling over sticks or the occasional rock is amusing. Adding a cart to the back of the truck also makes the challenge that much harder as it's not only the truck you have to get across the river. The driving itself seems quite realistic to me. I have also seen a lot of reviews saying it is ridiculous how some trucks have the hardest time going over rocks or even loose tree branches.\n\nAlthough it can be the case, typically the trucks shouldn't have too much of an issue going over the obstacles. Tree branches aren't too bad but the rocks will definitely set you back. I wish there was a bit more freedom within this realm to go over obstacles, but going through trees that haven't matured quite yet is pretty fun (disclaimer : I don't ride my Toyota through any tree, shrub or the sort. I love mother nature).  Sometimes where the is no path, a path can be made with a heavy truck pushing small trees aside. Most collisions feel right except one little thing that bugs me, why can't I drive into an exploding barrel that was put on the map? I know it's kind of silly to have such a thing next to a lumber yard, but why put it there if I can't "use" or hit it? The game has weird moments like this where it chooses to clip instead of let you collide. What I absolutely do love about this game is the winch. When I first started, I was extremely frightened to go at it alone as I would end up on my side or get stuck. I started learning how to use the winch efficiently and my experience with the game got a lot better. I'm glad I chose to play multiplayer first in lieu of single player. The community was a worldly and friendly one. Multiplayer WILL NOT save your  progress but single player WILL.\n\nGraphics are quite nominal especially when it comes to the mud and water. Trees are there but I think could have been done a bit better. Back drops are nice, would have been nicer with some mountains or something else to fill some gaps. The game also features a night and day scheme. The sounds are actually on point, and when your vehicle is physically damaged, damaged sounds also follow.\n\nI like this game, it could have been better with a bit more variation and a few more construction touches (crane's and the like... maybe even dirt diggers), none the less, pretty good game to some, decent for others. I would love to see more map additions and truck additions, and a little variations on objectives.\n\nI have yet to try the mods but when I do, I will update the review.\n\nI got this game for $10 and would say it's worth it. $30 may be slightly over stretching it for a few.\n\nRATING : 7.45/10\n\nScreenShots :\nThe crew ain't up to no good\n\nI don't think I've ever operated a truck in any game with a crane on it\n\nGot stuck and needed a little help from the winch\n\nAs mentioned earlier, sometimes going over such small branches can cause big problems (and frustrations)\n\nI drove on a long wavy road and on the horizon I saw a river. To my surprise, you can actually get across it with some planning (and the right truck)\n\nWhat driving at night looks like\n\nI thought I could Euro Truck simulator this bridge but being close to the edge, I fell","August 11, 2015","true","9.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

You cannot hear the other players vehicles etc. (Release version might be patched by now)\nThe controls... there is where it gets a little tricky.  The controls are awkward to get used too and even when you are, you spend most time reading back over them.  It is what I do.\n\nThe game itself has is a great one and not to be played alone.  Multiplayer with 4 friends is the best, really.\n\nIf you enjoy slow 4x4 changing to find the best possible route to an objective with too much water or mud infront of you.. You then work a way around it slow on the power in a low or high gear, then get stuck and winch out or a friend winchs you out, and then you get stuck and use a crane to frog it.\n\nReally the game is really good fun taking a slower pace to a driving simulator.  IT IS A SIMULATOR I swear.  It is really hard to get used too and you drive slow with friends.\n\nIt is realistic water terroforming, realistic terrain deforming and realisitic placement of everything, really a well made game and not to be taken as "yeah I am great at racing games" I am great at racing games and this is not a race!\nYou put tooooo much power on the wheels on the terrain you will become stuck because the tires dug into the terrain causing a hole... Amazing!\n\nDriving slow, enjoying the beautiful scenary.  Yes the game has some problems like random damage loss, random rock and getting stuck really easy, but you ignore them because it fun, driving, driving, stuck.. Winch out, driving driving, stuck, friend winchs you out, driving and reach destination... You fail to read and go respawn at garage, update your vehicle and then make the journey all over again, getting stuck, winching, driving, winching etc.. Read the mission you and a friend, you get logs for example and start to drive out but now you are top heavy with a heavier truck, you get a decent distance outside turn in mud and go FULLL POWERRRR... Then the truck tips over, your friends laugh and you smile because you enjoyed it and made a silly move... Now repeat.\n\nReally this is a great slow moving tactical approach to driving offroad game.

There is a lot of judging the road ahead, trying to spot the areas to avoid so you don't ditch or spill the load, winching yourself out of mud and holes, winching another truck out, examining the map, etc, etc. You have to be relaxed or you will just get nowhere.\nThe best part for me is just how immersive it all is. The truck models are top notch, the environment is thick and rich, and the way the mud squishes and deepens and exposes boulders is something I've never seen before... very realistic. And the physics and vehicle behavior all feel right; I mean, considering it's a video game. When it's night and you're alone on some muck-filled, forest path with crickets chirring and you're unsure where you might be, the sound of your mighty diesel is a very welcome thing.\nIt takes a little while to get used to the game; especially the camera.

Please don't give them money.","March 16","false","69.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

It sounds like a simple game, drive large (and some small) foreign trucks around a mud-filled map and pick up and deliver logs. Sounds easy? You'll find doing these tasks is actually rather challenging. The maps are designed around uncovering and planning the best route to take in order to get the job done. Sometimes you'll be faced with crossing huge rivers, rock filled mudpits, other times you'll be treated to plain old ashphalt.\n\nStrategizing and planning is part of the fun, and the rest comes from the amazingly trim and well optimized engine. The game, at release, is a whopping 595MB!  The particle, smoke and terrain deformation effects are all very well done and are a treat to look at. The maps are gorgeous, you will find yourself immediatley immersed in them. The sounds of rushing river water, chirping birds, crackling trees as you plow through them all add to make this game as realistic as possible.\n\nThe camera takes getting used to as it does control differently than anything else I have ever used. Once you do learn how it works, you'll find it irreplaceable. No need for 1st person cameras here. This is not a game of speed, but a game of strategy. You need to be able to see all sides of your vehicle, sometimes all at once in order to make it through trecherous terrain. I have read that the developers are thinking about adding in a cockpit view camera. I can almost assure you I will not use it. It would have almost no function in this game, and once you play, you will see what I mean.\n\nThis game has been a while in the making and I am glad its finally here. Planned future mod support and DLC from the developers will give this game a long life. I, for one will be there along the way.","June 13, 2014","true","25.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","2"

Drive big russian trucks through hazardous environments to collect lumber, and deliver it to locations on the map. The game looks gorgeous, but I had to try it before I considered buying it. I went to the Spintires website and downloaded the tech demo.\n\nI can easily say that I played the demo for more than 10 hours play time. And there weren't even any objectives in the demo. JUST DRIVING. The act of driving a large vehicle through mud, water and any other terrain the game had was fun enough. The terrain deforms in real time as the tires cut through it, this is a simulation game like no other. EVERY FACTOR MATTERS, the weight, which tires are spinning and making contact, are the tires wet? How heavy is the vehicle itself? How much is the force of the river pushing you off the road? How big is the tree you're making contact with and can you knock it over?\n\nSeriously, this game is just an early access game and already it has so much going for it.\n\nI bought the game and already after the amount of hours I've played it (at the time of this review (6 hours) I have yet to see the entire first map I've played and I haven't completed one objective yet (because I'm still enduring all that nature and it's mud can throw at me and my trucks).\n\nThis game is zen, it is a challenging and VERY rewarding experience for those who persist and overcome the obstacles in it. For those who look at this game and wonder, "But it's just driving through mud and getting stuck in it." No, it's about getting out of the mud. Just go download the tech demo now to see if it's for you.\n\nUPDATE: So I finally played multiplayer.\n\nIt's great! It was fun enough to just play with one other person, so I'm sure it's great with more. I cleared all cloaks and assisted the other player while they hauled loads of lumber. It's a great co op experience. But you know what this needs? Team VS matches. Also, time trials. That would up the ante.\n\nGot disconnected at one point when I FINALLY got to the other player to unflip their vehicle. haha\n\nGREAT GAME PURCHASE IT NOW 10/10 And it's only getting better from here!","June 24, 2014","true","19.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The camera control is unusable, trailers have a habit of disappearing, and the map feature is near useless.\n\nThe camera does not have dedicated pan and tilt. Instead, you have a hotkey to 'focus' on the truck, and a similar key to focus on the trailer. To view 'first person' camera, you click on a transparent camera where the driver sits. There is no hotkey for this. If you click anywhere that isn't on a menu item or winch point or similar, the game toggles into or out of camera control, rather than only while you hold down the button. You'll be accidentally switching into camera control mode rather often when you meant to release a winch or click on a menu item.\n\nTrailers may disappear until a game restart if you change the bed of your truck at a garage. I do not know of a way to make them re-appear without a game restart. Similarly, if you disconnect your trailer because it got stuck, I cannot figure out how to re-attach it; even when directly on top of the hitch, it constantly states I am too far away.\n\nThe map starts out nearly completely black for each map. The concept is that as you drive around, the map slowly reveals areas you've been to. However, the area that is revealed is smaller than what you can already see. As you travel down a road and spot a side-road heading off of it, the map doesn't reveal enough that you can see that side-road. While this doesn't seem like an issue, it's annoying when you're trying to turn around onto such a road and you can't see where it is because of the aforementioned camera issues. Maps therefore become a complete guessing and memorizing game, which while more realistic, doesn't actually do what a map should. Oh, and there's no minimap, so you'll be starting and stopping a lot.\n\nAll this being said, the concept of the game is great. It's a ton of fun when you get a giant truck through some deep mud or a river that you thought would be impossible to cross. Given a bit more work on the camera and map (as well as bugfixes such as with trailers), I can see myself playing this quite often. However, seeing the age of the game and that these basic things are in such a state, I can't say I'm too hopeful that it will ever reach its potential.","April 17, 2015","false","8.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwait/recommended/263280/","gwait","gwait","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwait/","805 products in account","I remember seeing the Kickstarter page of this game and at the time I didn't really look at the description and gameplay of the game as I closed the browser window very quickly. Now that I think back about it, I should have supported the game but I've done so by pre-ordering the game before its release and I must say that it's probably the first game ever that I purchased in 2014 that is worth the full amount of money that I spent on it.\n\nThis game is something unique as you're able to experience what it is like to travel through mud and how frustrating it would be if you had to do the same thing in real life.\n\nI will give advantages and disadvantages based on the current version of the game at the current time (19/06/2014).\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Very good mud physics. It's not just a regular mud that you drive on and from under your wheels you just see some dust appear. Mud can give you a really good challenge because you can flip very easily. One wrong wheel on the wrong side of the mud with a bit of accelerator and the next thing you know is that your truck has flipped. I also love that when you drive through mud, the terrain actually distorts. I love it that there's been a great focus on the mud physics and the developers certainly delivered it.\n2. Well designed and well balanced vehicles.\n3. The game is really challenging, especially on Hardcore mode. You're going to need a good team of friends in Multiplayer who know what they're doing.\n4. Lots of challenging achievements. I love achievements! They're not something that you get within first 20 hours of the game. I'm 21 hours into the game and only achieved 16 of 50 achievements.\n5. You can take down trees with your truck. This isn't exactly easy but it's a good quality of the game.\n6. When you drive through water, the water is very realistic. You can actually see the water change where your tires move, which is really awesome.\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Lack of objectives. There is only a single objective to complete in each map and that is to deliver logs. The objective IS challenging but it is just repetitive, especially if you have completed the objectives on all of the maps.\n2. Lack of vehicles. Not sure about the exact number of vehicles currently in the game but I'm sure it's below 10.\n3. Lack of maps. Hopefully more will be added in the future.\n\nThat's all for the advantages & disadvantages from top of my head.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game as these disadvantages are not game breaking and does not ruin the game itself. The developers seem to be very helpful and developers seem to be people who listen to the community, and that is what I like about them. I'm sure that within some time, they'll definitely add more items into the game.\n\nI rate this game 10/10 as it's the best game I've played in a while.","June 19, 2014","true","24.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Some bugs and in some ways feels like an early access title.\n\nNow onto the good.\n\n1. Fairly realistic fluid displacement engine, you create tracks in the mud and if you're not careful you will find yourself bogged very fast.\n\n2. Co-op multiplayer, its always fun playing with friends.\n\n3. Nice graphics engine and Truck models. While it isn't the best game graphically, everything comes together well, the game runs great and looks nice in most parts, the Truck models are top notch though.\n\n4. Several different trucks with different attachments. This means you and your friends can set yourself up with the perfect trucks for any given situation and actually use teamwork.\n\n5. A winch system! You can winch yourself and friends out when they are bogged, you can winch yourself to a tree to pull yourself out if no one is around to help, lots of fun and very cool.\n\nI could write far more about this game, but if the idea of 4WDing around several big open world maps is appealing, just take the plunge and make the purchase, you won't regret it.\n\n9/10","June 16, 2014","true","19.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You play as a russian lumberman and you task is it, to transport logs from one point to another point on the map. You complete your mission with old Russian trucks in a world out of mud, water (rivers and seas) and very big forests, which are distributed on the map. At this moment, Spintires offers you 6 different maps, more of them are in deployment.\nThe primary intention of Spintires is it, to drive the different old trucks, to find a way completing your mission. You do that in the third person perspective on the left side near your truck. Once started the game you can decide what you want to do:\nExplore the world and find new ways to complete your task?\nYou want to try something out or only playing in the open world?\nOr want you to play in the multiplayer?\nIt's your choice!\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nIn Spintires you have a lots of options to change the game. Next to the basically options you can play Spintires also with the Gamepad, Xbox 360 controller or a wheel.\nThe controlling and timing fits well with the game.\nThe graphics and sounds are fluently also on middle sized computers, but sometimes small lags could you be appear. Graphics a very detailed, for example mud, which flies around you vehicle and realistic water animations. How realistic it is, is addicted to the power of your computer.\nThe game maybe won't start at the first time and could crash while playing. To save your progress there is only one memory location, if you want to start a new game on another map, you have to delete the old memory unit.\n\nPOSITIV's and NEGATIV's\n+ beautiful and realistic locations and vehicles\n+ detailed trucks and settings\n+ also controllable with alternative methods\n+ continued deployment\n+ two game modes for individual simulation\n+ available in 16 languages\n\n- start problems, crashes and save problems\n- lags while playing\n- "only" six maps and a handful of vehicles\n- possibly difficult controls\n- Multiplayer is possibly very insecure\n\nCONCLUSION\nSpintires is a good game with a great idea and a lots of potential in it. But until it's great or perfect, there is missing a lot of work and time. This game is something for people, who have fun driving big trucks with bigger mileage or who are a bit bored and want to taste a day of work with lumbermen.\nActually Spintires costs 24,99€ on steam, I don't really recommend the game for this price, wait until it's on sale or deployed longer.\nBecause the game is already under deployment, I will write more reviews with more actual information in the future!\n\n\nMorrisReview","July 16, 2015","true","36.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

But, as someone who has driven large trucks for a living and spent a bit of time offroad (with said trucks), they've done a really good job of capturing the feel of those situations. And yes, somethings will feel a little "wonky" and off, but the Dev's seem like they're actively going to continue working on this title so I'm willing to overlook a few quirks. I'm also willing to overlook a few quirks because what they've created is spectacular. The sounds in this game are better than a lot of AAA developer titles, and its not like there's a lot going on to listen to. The excellent, and realistic, audio really helped draw me in. The visuals are slick, but its the phyiscs engine they've got this running on that really pulls it all together. Its simply fantastic. The terrain deformation, the suspension modeling, its all perfect. Like I said, I've driven large trucks offroad on many occasions for a job I used to have, and I've recoverd trucks from rouch spots (all two wheel drive, and non with locking diffs). Its a hard thing to pull off. And this game is hard. I mean, really, absurdly hard. I can attest that the handling is pretty on to what a truck like this would do, even at speeds. They've done a great job of recreating the real thing. The real thing is hard. This game. Is. Hard. I spent my first few hours attempting to explore and move loads, only to make one hair-line mistake in mis-judging an incline causing my truck to roll and dump its load, or not expecting a bit of water to be as deep as it drops off and suddenly flooding it hard. Its pretty much the real deal. So, if you don't want to just explore by yourself or get frustrated, than look elsewhere. You may also want to bring a friend along for the torture in multiplayer as you can really save each other from some literal rock-and-hard place spots. As for me, for now, I'll just be like Stanley and "Begin the game again."\n\n\n10/10 Because Big Trucks","June 12, 2014","true","30.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

Enjoy amazing graphics satisfying sounds and a whole range of vehicles? Then you'll love Spintires, but it does have its flaws. Spintires is a driving adventure game with lots of things to do.\n\nFirstly lets cover the maps: As of 19/11/15 there are 7 maps with unlimited posiblities. In the maps you have multiple different types of terrains which some cars/trucks can handle but some can't. You can drive in water but it does increase your damage level. Pretty much all the maps are based in Russia and you can unlock multiple garages to store your trucks. Many people disliked this game at first due to its lack of updates but now the developers have seemingly come back to life and added about 5 more trucks/cars with loads of different mods.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay: Driving in this game is quite fun, you can do it with friends also. Driving through the mud is a tricky buisness, whilst driving through it your tires can dig into the mud, which makes the game a lot harder, but wheres the fun without difficulty right, RIGHT? There are unfortunatley only two camera angles for driving in this game (Main 3rd person camera and rooftop camera) but both are nice and you can have your own custom view settings which save when you exit the game?! And when you log back into your save, it carrys on from that exact location.\n\nNow: Objectives: There are multiple objectives in this game, such as a forestry delivery. In the forestry objective you have do deliver wood logs from one side of the map to the other. Also you can unlock garages by delivering "garage points" to them, every map has about 3 garages and when you quit the game saves your trucks there!\n\nSo in conclusion a massive Russian map with true mud trucks, deliver logs, tow trucks and have a Russian swear at you when toggling diferential lock and all wheel drive. Just buy this game (Find it on the Steam Store £20, Bundle Stars Sales around £6,66, ♥♥♥ approx £3,75+) Prices may vary.","November 19, 2015","true","33.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I haven't been the same person ever since.\n\nUpon my birth Reptilians have planted a device in my head that lets them read my thoughts. For a reason unknown to me they established Oovee Game Studios (oh come on, doesn't THAT sound Reptilian?) and used all the information they gathered to create a video game of my dreams.\n\nIn Spintires you assume the role of a Soviet truck driver in 1980's Siberian woodlands where a concept of "concrete roads" is considered an imperialists' attempt to weaken the USSR.\nYour main task (and by far really the only one) is to pick up wooden logs from point A and deliver them to point B.\nEasy, right? Well... IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥ NOT.\n\nAt the beginning you get max 2 vehicles - usually a jeep and a small truck. Jeep is purely for exploration purposes, in which it excels, while the truck, in theory capable of delivering small logs, is best in support role as it doesn't even have an all wheel drive. To be able to complete your task you have to start with exploration.\n\nYour minimap is full of dark spots which you uncover driving near their centers. Knowing the terrain is critical in planning the route. Even the biggest trucks won't go through rivers and dense forests. You have to drive smart. But even the best route available won't promise you success if you don't have the right equipment. More trucks can be unlocked the same way as minimap which is driving near them.\n\nAll vehicles can be customised in garages, though the options available vary for each vehicle. Your trucks can carry spare parts (as trucks can be damaged), fuel (as some trucks may use even 20+ liters of fuel per MINUTE of driving), trailers for wooden logs in different sizes (there are 3 sizes of wooden logs). If your main truck is badly damaged or runs out of fuel you can use the other one, with proper equipment, to save it.\n\nWhether exploring or completing the delivery your greatest enemy is Russia itself. It does what Russia does. It kills you. It devours you. It consumes both your truck and your very soul. This is where the ♥♥♥♥♥ gets serious. Physics in the game are simply marvellous. Trucks react to every bump, each wheel's suspension is independent, tires deform. Terrain is also gorgeous. Mud deforms under your wheels in real time and it stays deformed for as long as you play on the map, water behaves in a very natural way and you can mow down small trees.\n\nThe game is pretty difficult and it favors patience. Moving through the mud is slow and painful. More than once you will find yourself stuck or flipped upside down. In many times you will have to use the winch (it's a really helpful tool) or revert your truck back to garage (but only in casual mode. In hardcore mode if you're ♥♥♥♥♥ then you're ♥♥♥♥♥). The game is also moddable. First mods were released for closed beta which sounds promising for the future of this title. There's also multiplayer.\n\nThere are some downsides as well. Graphics are good but not the best, the only real task so far is delivering wood, the game saves your progress only on one map at once (if you want to play on another map all your progress is lost), maps are similar in many ways, draw distance could be better, lighting at night is pretty awkward AND THE WAY CAMERA WORKS IS A REAL BUMBERFUK. I don't want to sound like a fanboy (even though I am one) but I believe many of those problems will be fixed as both developers and community do their best.\n\nYou can download tech demo  BY CLICKING HERE YOU BLIND MOTHERFUKER [oovee.chicsystems.net] to see if the concept of Spintires seems to be appealing to you as I believe it will not be to many. Many of you fukers will be disgusted by it.\nSo should you buy it then?\n\nYes.\n\nBecause in the end the money you give to the developers, if not you, will at least benefit me, and honestly it's all that really matters.","June 13, 2014","true","84.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Someone's going to get stuck, someone's going to tilt a load, and someone's going to forget to fuel up and it's just going to be a whole pizza instead of french fry kind of time.\n\nIn whole, I just had a game where I played for nearly 4 hours with friends and had a really traumatic time involving a truck. I'm just really triggered now.\n\n7/10, would flip tables over trucks falling over again.","February 10","true","36.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","63","12","19","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StormTruck/recommended/263280/","StormTruck","StormTruck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StormTruck/","247 products in account","SpinTires is a game all about driving and make delivery in the Siberia era. This is a new and fresh type of game for the OFF Road/ Simulator genre. I have been following this game for quite some time back in 2013 when it was Kickstarted and of corse i gave some money on their kickstarter to get the game going on and testet the heavy moddable Tech Demo of the game. Now back to this time SpinTires is now final out, at least with a version with a lot more contenct and objective to it. Now i think it will fallow the same line with Euro Truck with frekvent content updates and pathes for the game. This game is all about driving in very muddiy terrain in the Siberia era. You start off with scouting around the era and unclock the cloucking which enables you to see the era on your map. Then when you have planed your route you can take your Truck and do the log delivery from the lobber mill to the objective destination. I like this idea and it requires you to do more planing which is something i like. I will give you the pros and cons about this game.\n\nPros:\n- Extremly vell done physic in this game\n- A lot of fun to drive in the muddy terrain\n- Pretty decent graphic, not the next Crysis but really great for an Off Road/ Simulator game\n- Nice combination and well made truck moddels, they also sound great\n- Fun to explore the map\n- The game will get a lot of mods which gives this game good value in the long run and gives you good reason to replay it\n- There is quite amount of add ons to the vehicles\n- The game runs creat, i get 60 FPS but i also think the frame rate is limited to 60. But that alright. 60 is more than enough (GTX 660 OC)\n\nCons:\n- The camera is a bit messy, you often have to adjust and it hard to get it work properly. This is something they are working on a fix. There will also be interior camera in the future as far as i know.\n- Not to many maps to choose between and there is not to much variation on them either, of corse as this game support mods there will come some great community maps later, same goes for the vehicles, there could be more of it but there will also be mods that covers this con.\n- Not to many objects. The only goal is to delivere logs, it would be cool to delivere something more than just logs\n\nSo yeah, the games is very playeble and can't waith for the mods to come. I will say that if you like Euro Truck, Off Road or just wanna have some new and fresh simulator that is good at what it does you will find a lot of it here.","June 21, 2014","true","19.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. Here is a short review and/or summary of this game.\n\nFirst, the mud effects are great. Obviously I have never seen anything like it in a video game to date. Being a person who enjoys mudding in real life, this game was a must get. The ruts that appear after you dirve through an area just really make you feel as if you are there.\n\nThis game offers a real imersive feel. You can use a winch, you have to worry about fuel, you have to worry about not damaging your vehicle(which by the way, you can see the damage on the vehicle which is a great touch!)and if that isn't enough, there is another hardcore setttings which feature even more realistic additions to make your experience more immersive and of course difficult.\n\nThe graphics. The graphics are outstanding. They are very pleasing to the eye and definitely cater to the immersive feel and the physics are great.\n\nNow you may be thinking that this is game with no objectives at all. Well if you thought that, you are mistaken, because there are logging missions which is another fine touch to this game.\n\nThere kind of is a short ammount of different vehicles, but said vehicles are customizable and also there are mods to fill your want for a new ride.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of this game makes it really enjoyable. You can invite your friend to go along with you exploring and doing whatever you feel like in the large worlds. Be it forging new paths, playing in the mud, playing in the water, hill climbing, logging, or discovering the entire map and unlocking garages in the maps. There are limitless options to what you can do in this game.\n\nThere is a decent variety of maps for you to choose from allowing you to explore a lot of new land.\n\nI truly love this game and got it around when it first came out and have enjoyed it all. Like I said, if you enjoy offroading, mudding, multiplayer, and free roam, this is the game for you. I hope you benefitted from my short review.","August 16, 2015","true","25.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes, absolutly! I usually want to get at least 1 hour per $1 spent on a game and you should have no issues getting at least 30 fun filled hours of play time. It is the best when it comes to mud and getting stuck. My only complaint is that it is lacking content and missions. I'm really hoping that they add much more to this game, even if its paid DLC.

The kind of particular where, if you like trudging through where few men have dared trudge before, you'll like this game. I definitely don't think it's a game for everybody. What is very unique to SPINTIRES™ is the comradery between people in multiplayer. Especially on hardcore mode. There is no shortage of people wanting to drag you out of muddy holes or swampy lakes, and with a smile. Even sometimes flipping you if the somewhat erratic physics engine decides that your biggest potential is achieved while lying on your back. SPINTIRES™ certaintly has potential since there is still some progress to be had, as the only objectives so far is retrieving logs.\n\nI give the game a 7.9/10","November 13, 2014","true","15.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Well, for me, this is the reverse. When I  first saw Spintires I didn't believe it would be any good. Then I tried the tech demo they released and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nObviously this game is not a standard fare AAA title from the likes of Electronic Arts, Codemasters, Valve, even RAREWARE* for the Xbox. It is built around off-road physics and the ability to drive, off-road. Sounds simple, but alas the engine running the game needs to be capable of correctly calculating every nuance in the road surface, each dip and lip of hill or rock. I never thought they would be able to do it, but yet here I am.\n\nThe vehicles in any game like this, can make or break it. This game has a few vehicles, including the mighty MAZ. But it may leave a distinct taste in the mouth of people who love having a decent selection on offer. Although you should stop there and ignore that taste left by the lack thereof, and continue on and really get to grips with the physics of the game itself. It is true, it is not a game for everyone, but where this game fails, it delivers in almost atop fashion by capturing your every thought pattern.\n\nThe main reason for this game, is the physics and the ability to take what you believe you know, off-roading, and put it to the test. The basic premise of the game is to take a delivery from one part of the map, to the other. Simple enough, but then you also have to worry about damage and your fuel, because as we all know, roaming about hills takes it's toll on your fuel reserves. The maps themselves, have a "fog of war" to them. In-game it is known as "cloaked", and by "de-cloaking" areas you open up more of the map that you get to see when you are driving. Otherwise you have to play it by feel alone, trusting in your compass. Added is the ability to lock your diff's on the various vehicles as well as enabling and disabling All-Wheel drive. Although I must point out, that using a locked diff, your vehicle's turning radius is less, than when off. Both your diff locks and All-Wheel drive's will consume more fuel, so proper planning is needed for that. The rest, I feel is best left unsaid and left to the player to find and enjoy.\n\nAlong the way as you try to get your cargo from one location to the next, are various hazards you must negotiate. Whilst it is an off-roading game, it never feels like I have to race from one location to the next, but simply to take it at my own pace, and maximise my uses of the vehicle I am currently driving.\n\nThe camera in the game itself, is rather odd in it's own unique way and composition. It moves differently to how another game may implement.\n\nOf course all this has been said before. So I shall take my leave, leaving this one last comment and score.\n\nIf you are unsure about the game, as it will only appeal to a certain few, try the free demo from the official site, and if you need more content, the game is moddable, and many mods exist.\n\n-------\nGraphics: 92%\nGameplay: 91%\nLongevity: 84%\nOverall: 89%\n\n\n\n(*RAREWARE currently known as RARE, bought by Microsoft from Nintendo.

Although a small tracked vehicle whould be nice for schouting other then the uaz, im sure they will add one as they promissed and you can tell by the forums. Wonderful graphics and runs great on anything other then a toaster. And to everyone whos posting bad reviews saying, "the route lead me through trees which i had to push over".

Vehicles are poorly modled and textured, and the physics? lol. Since it's release, it's gotten two or three new levels, and other than a new manual clutch system (which doesn't really fix the problem) the physics hasn't been touched.\n\nNot a lot of user content that works, a couple are decently made, and by decently made I mean they look better than the "photorealism" textures from 2001 that the default trucks use. Speaking of default trucks, some of them don't really serve a purpose after you get other trucks(B-130), or any purpose at all(UAZ). You can now change your start trucks to completely opt-out of using them to begin with.\n\nIf you want a nice physics based vehicle game where you can hit mud, climb hills, and other stuff, just get Rigs of Rods, it might be dead, but its free, and there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of content for it. If you find you like Rigs of Rods and don't want it to be dead, try BeamNG, its basicly a clone, even has some dev work from RoR guys, and they've got growing quality content too.\n\nTL;DR: There are games that do it better, much better, and much cheaper(free).","October 4, 2014","false","29.0"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","34","63","0","0"

When you first play the game being able to go 500m without getting stuck is huge. There's no GPS to show you the easiest way to go from A to B, you have to find it yourself, you have to decide, and finally live with the consequences.\nOh, and don't trust the path you took before, the mud's always getting worse.\n(of course you can always reset your trucks back to the workshop but where's the fun in that :D )\n\nThe only negative point so far is the impossibility to save multiplayer. So with friends, you're forced to play it as a roguelike experience. The problem is noted by the devs and will (hopefully) soon be addressed.","December 4, 2014","true","22.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

I had a friend lose his computer, so he downloaded Spintires onto a seven year old Dell and it runs smoothly on the lowest settings.\n\nYou are now able to preview future updates by opting into their most recent beta releases.\nGraphics drastically improve.\nAlso future updates call for mod support.\nI have only good things to say about this game. Absolutely love it.\n\nBelow is a snippet of my old review.\n\n---\n\nEven my friends who could care less about off-roading enjoyed this game.\nEverything about it is beautiful, every time I stop my truck it looks like a promotional screenshot.\nHas everything you would want in an offroading game, absolutely everything, and anything anyone else would want in a co-op challange.\nHaving your truck frustratingly sunk or tipped in some mud is crushing. Absolutely crushing. But, that nigh-impossible recovery is oh-so satisfying.\n\nNeed I also mention that this game is FANTASTICALLY optimized. The graphics are unbelievable and gameplay is flawlessly smooth.\n\nShort story, I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you're on the fence, don't think twice.

I waited patiently for the full release ever since I first saw the tech demo a long time ago, and I was not disappointed when the full game was released.\n\nThis is not a game that everyone will enjoy, especially not those looking for a fast paced quick fix. This is a game that takes patience and planning. However, if you do have the patience, the time invested can be very rewarding. It feels great to finally get that last load delivered after going through hell just to get to your destination, or having to pull a fully damaged vehicle out of a bog or water and then tow it to a garage because you have run out of repair points in your utility kit.\n\nThe game is even more fun when played with a couple of friends, especially if you all have a fridge full of beer so you can take a break after getting through some rough terrian and take the time to grab a fresh can and roll yourself a smoke.\n\nThe addition of the editor is a good direction for the game, allowing users to create their own vehicles. I wait with baited breath for a map editor now.\n\nThere are some quirks, such as only one player getting an achievement for finishing a map in multiplayer, other players trucks being ghosts when not in use, savegames (sometimes) breaking between updates, but these will be solved over time.\n\nSome additions I would like to see made to the game would be: larger and more maps, more variety of objectives, earth moving equipment so you could repair tracks, changing weather and different seasons.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to anyone who likes the idea of driving trucks through mud, water and rough terrain.\n\n5/5","January 7","true","189.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is a very impressive realism to the terrain and with the environment all together.  And it can get very unforgiving to the novice explorer.  There is a fair array of trucks to drive and the majarity of them are off-road purpose built, russian military trucks that look quite unstoppable.\n\nThere is more to this game then just getting stuck waist high in sucking mud, high centering on large rocks or fallen trees or swamping out the engine in deep waters.  You can winch yourself out of tough places.  Plow over trees that get in your way.  Keep in mind, the bigger the truck your driving, the bigger the tree you can crush.  Run fuel and repair supplies to broken down trucks.  Open up other garage places and even haul logs to lumber mills.  In fact, the main objective is to haul lumber to the mills through the most challenging terrain imaginable.  And if that's not enough, you can team up with up to 3 of your friends and tackle the challenge together.\n\nThe game currently does have some draw backs though.  The camera still needs some work as it can get difficult to see where you want to look.  Especially when your in a tight group of trees, on a steep hill or working with the crane.  The manual transmission mode is awkward and clumsy but you will get use to it over time.  And the multiplayer mode is very lacking.  Yes, you can help your friends by winching them out of tight places or giving them fuel or repairs.  But you can't see their lights, hear their trucks engines or see what they have done to the terrain after they have driven over it.  You can't help your friends load lumber and you can't see your friends trucks that they have abandoned.  Only the trucks they are currently using.\n\nOver all, the game is pretty well put together and while being played in hardcore mode, can offer a challenge to even the most seasoned off-roaders.  Given all that I have said, there is a certain level of fun to this game that will have you coming back for more.  And if the creators of this game do something to address the issues I had mentioned above, it would make this game so much more enjoyable.","August 25, 2014","true","310.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

You will inevitably get stuck and have to winch your way out, either yourself or with another vehicle (could be a friend in multiplayer) or you will capsize and have to put back your truck on all wheels (same way)\ndoing stupid stuff damages vehicles, you can repair them with special utility trailers that you have to drive yourself.\n\nNow the major part of the game is basically driving around in very bad terrain using AWD and differential lock wisely (uses more fuel) and having to navigate in a map where you need to manually decloak everything (or not if you know the map by heart) you do get a compass.\nThe game simulates night and day.\nYou can pack wood by yourself but the game actually makes you put 3 logs in a truck and by a click of the mouse you make those 3 logs be a full complement of wood (Don't really like that for immersion )\nor, you click on a load wood button in a lumber area and voila the wood is in your trailer.\nI thought you'd have to cut it yourself or something but no. it magically appears.\n\nI'm having a lot of fun getting stuck by trying stupid stuff and new routes (the more dangerous the more fun it is), capsizing, getting back using the truck crane , and with a few friends (4 players max in a game) it can get very amusing.\nA good buy on sale or at about 15€ I guess, since the game although very playable isn't very full with material, it's more a sandbox in which you can have fun with friends.","November 4, 2014","true","41.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You can tell this by the attention to detail the devs have put in. The water moves as you push forward into it, the mud sticks to the wheels and sprays backwards as your tyres spin furiously to gain traction, the gorgeous visuals coupled with immersive sounds of a wet muddy forest filled with wildlife and the vehicles you use to drive through all this makes for a unique gaming experience.\nThere are 5 maps to explore, all of them are hidden beneath "cloaking" points that need to be unlocked in order to reveal the areas hidden beneath them. You do this by driving around the map in a variety of vehicles that anyone who's played Dayz mod will instantly recognise.\n\nThe main objective of the game is to collect and deliver lumber. This is done by hauling small, medium or large logs around the map to a pre determined point. Youll drive through impossibly deep mud, fast running rivers, tall thick forests and still tranquil lakes. Youll also need to negotiate steep inclines, often muddy wet steep inclines that will require some measure of fore thought before attempting. If you get stuck you can always fall back on the handy winch feature that attachs to any nearby tree, enabling you to pull yourself out of trouble, which is inevitably where you'll end up.\nOther vehicles aid you in the completion of this objective such as repair and fuel trucks. These all need to be driven by the player by swapping from one vehicle to another as they become unlocked on the map.\n\nThe one thing that lets this game down is the camera. You follow vehicles from an off centre perspective that works well when youre on the wider areas of the map, but as soon as things get tight the limitations of this become apparent. Trying to see where you're going when the scenery closes in, or when your're trying to save yourself from toppling  over on one of the many steep inclines that run out of deep water crossings, can be frustrating. Thankfully this doesnt hurt the game to much but it does take something away from the gaming experience.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer option that enables you to basically do whats done in single player only you get to drive around with friends as well.\n\nI like this game because it's challenging and is gorgeous to look at. It is one of those games that just grows on you the more you play it and the challenge to deliver those logs to there destination while negotiating the steep, muddy, rocky, wet, uneven and trecherous "roads" you travel along,  make for a rich and rewarding gaming experience.","June 15, 2014","true","24.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandmansa/recommended/263280/","sandmansa","Sandman[SA]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandmansa/","92 products in account","This game is revolutionary in the realm of off-road driving simulators as I don't believe there is anything else out there quite like SpinTires.  There is a very impressive realism to the terrain and with the environment all together.  And it can get very unforgiving to the novice explorer.  There is a fair array of trucks to drive and the majarity of them are off-road purpose built, russian military trucks that look quite unstoppable.\n\nThere is more to this game then just getting stuck waist high in sucking mud, high centering on large rocks or fallen trees or swamping out the engine in deep waters.  You can winch yourself out of tough places.  Plow over trees that get in your way.  Keep in mind, the bigger the truck your driving, the bigger the tree you can crush.  Run fuel and repair supplies to broken down trucks.  Open up other garage places and even haul logs to lumber mills.  In fact, the main objective is to haul lumber to the mills through the most challenging terrain imaginable.  And if that's not enough, you can team up with up to 3 of your friends and tackle the challenge together.\n\nThe game currently does have some draw backs though.  The camera still needs some work as it can get difficult to see where you want to look.  Especially when your in a tight group of trees, on a steep hill or working with the crane.  The manual transmission mode is awkward and clumsy but you will get use to it over time.  And the multiplayer mode is very lacking.  Yes, you can help your friends by winching them out of tight places or giving them fuel or repairs.  But you can't see their lights, hear their trucks engines or see what they have done to the terrain after they have driven over it.  You can't help your friends load lumber and you can't see your friends trucks that they have abandoned.  Only the trucks they are currently using.\n\nOver all, the game is pretty well put together and while being played in hardcore mode, can offer a challenge to even the most seasoned off-roaders.  Given all that I have said, there is a certain level of fun to this game that will have you coming back for more.  And if the creators of this game do something to address the issues I had mentioned above, it would make this game so much more enjoyable.","August 25, 2014","true","310.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

You will inevitably get stuck and have to winch your way out, either yourself or with another vehicle (could be a friend in multiplayer) or you will capsize and have to put back your truck on all wheels (same way)\ndoing stupid stuff damages vehicles, you can repair them with special utility trailers that you have to drive yourself.\n\nNow the major part of the game is basically driving around in very bad terrain using AWD and differential lock wisely (uses more fuel) and having to navigate in a map where you need to manually decloak everything (or not if you know the map by heart) you do get a compass.\nThe game simulates night and day.\nYou can pack wood by yourself but the game actually makes you put 3 logs in a truck and by a click of the mouse you make those 3 logs be a full complement of wood (Don't really like that for immersion )\nor, you click on a load wood button in a lumber area and voila the wood is in your trailer.\nI thought you'd have to cut it yourself or something but no. it magically appears.\n\nI'm having a lot of fun getting stuck by trying stupid stuff and new routes (the more dangerous the more fun it is), capsizing, getting back using the truck crane , and with a few friends (4 players max in a game) it can get very amusing.\nA good buy on sale or at about 15€ I guess, since the game although very playable isn't very full with material, it's more a sandbox in which you can have fun with friends.","November 4, 2014","true","41.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zigzachman/recommended/263280/","zigzachman","ZigZach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zigzachman/","93 products in account","This is a great engine. The reason I say engine instead of game is because there's actually very little to do once you start playing. You can uncloak hidden areas of each map, unlock vehicles by getting close to them, deliver resources to unlock garages, and finally deliver logs to finish the map objectives, but basically you drive from A to B. I say this not to imply that Spintires isn't worthy of our praise, or your support, but to make it clear that Spintires is not about the destination, so much as the journey there.\n\nAs other games have similarly done before, Spintires gives us an engine to create our own personalized experiences based on our direct interaction with this games biggest foe, the terrain.  Where Arma 3 has you perform recon and select the most tactical positions for your squad before a firefight, Spintires has you controlling gearboxes and determining the best tire placement over the most unforgiving, and detailed terrain I've ever encountered in a game.  While some people may find Spintires boring, other games have proven over and over that even some of the most tedious tasks supported on a solid foundation can find a strong following.  Those who may find navigating European roads, piloting an aircraft, or managing resources enjoyable may also find some fun and often exhilarating moments in lining up the perfect path between trees, struggling through mud holes with a large log trailer, or winching your friend out of an impossible situation so you can both continue exploring.\n\nWith the praise I'm giving the game I will point out some flaws. First, the camera isn't the easiest to work with, but this is being remedied. Second, you currently cannot see the terrain deformation caused by fellow players in multiplayer, also planned to be fixed I believe. Third, other small glitches occur(sometimes resources wont be counted as delivered, chat box closes randomly, winch can cause problems occasionally in multiplayer, and other small things that will be addressed).  I would have suggested releasing this title in it's current state under Early Access, because even though I love the game and trust they will fix everything, it doesn't help your credibility to release a title in this state. I would have purchased it at the same price in Early Access, and would not have batted an eye at any bugs or flaws currently occuring, in fact I probably would have been impressed at how completed the title already was. I know this makes no actual difference, but from a consumer standpoint I can see how the developers might have benefitted from the Early Access program, giving them more time to run public beta, and also more funding to allow for the extended beta development stage.\n\nThis game scratches the itch that I have never been able to reach. It started with 4x4 Evolution and Test Drive: Offroad on PS2, continued with MotorM4x and Offroad Drive on PC, and finally Spintires gets it right.  As it stands I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in any of the titles I just mentioned, I also want to press that this is a much more realistic offroad representation, you will very rarely break the 30mph mark, and you will get stuck often, the game is called Spintires, and it ain't cause your doing burnouts.  If this game receives the mod support it deserves I would bet we will be seeing this game for a long time to come.","June 23, 2014","true","113.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Spintires is a great game for a niche group of like minded people, meaning, if you enjoy putting games at their max difficulty (Hardcore for Spintires) and actually playing the game as it is intended by immersing yourself in the game world and approaching the challenges as realistically as you can if you were faced with a similar scenario in real life you will find a pleasant and challenging experience. Alternatively, if you just want to mod the ever living hell out of the game and put vehicles and random stuff in it you will greatly diminish your experience. I challenge the modders to put meaningful mods in the game in the future and add a more interesting challenge or environment vice building "super trucks" that you just direct around the map.

Then this is the game for you. There's a reason it has external cameras; you will be constantly enjoying the vehicle bucking and twisting as it goes over rocks, branches and bogs down in ruts full of mud and water. The game is pure eye candy!  Water physically Pushes against Your truck and cleans mud off your caked wheels.  Loading logs is pretty easy with an Xbox controller and gives you another sense of the passion that Oovee have put into this. The truck will move as it's loaded up or as you lift loads with the crane. it will physically sit down in the mud or on its suspension. It will also quite simply topple over if it's limits are exceeded. Very realistic indeed. Gameplay is a bit cheesy with' cloaking ' points needing to be uncovered to view hidden vehicles or tracks/roads across water or which are the "correct" path, which are otherwise completely black on the map view. The game truly doesn't need this as the true battle is finding your way across terrain or water, that will in an instant trap your vehicle or drown it! Meaning you have to try and recover it to a garage by towing it, or clicking it back to a garage you have unlocked or in the worst scenario, starting the map all over again. The pleasure is managing your fuel, putting tankers in strategic points on your route and using correct vehicles to both deliver your load and pull your vehicle out of drastic situations. Once you finish the maps you will be crying out for more!! You want expansion packs, more trucks, challenges, cranes, punctures, business model, trains, real roads like ETS2 etc.  The list is endless, it leaves your craving tons more. You end up watching real Vids of Russian trucks hauling logs or *anything* mud related; hill climbs for eg. The sad thing is there is nothing in the pipeline at the moment. Oovee have released the truck editor and soon a map editor, but it's like they have passed the buck to the community to keep this, very unusual, sim alive. It's frustrating along with a very,very annoying trait that every time Oovee release an update, it wipes out your game saves. Leaving all those maps as if you've never been there.. Somehow you are still drawn towards it but it will no doubt test the patience of gamers unless they sort this issue out. Try the demo out, which was at Oovee site.","December 22, 2015","true","80.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There will be frustrating moments, as you spend lots of time extracting yourself from Mud.\n\nThe truck models and rendering are great. The physics and visual effects are also good, especially the deformable terrain (Mud) and destructible small trees, which allows you to feel like you are actually affecting real objects.\n\nThe current number of maps is small, and once you conquer the rough spots on one map, you will be eager to move to the next, and all of the available maps are soon completed.

First I love the idea described, but I don't feel it is delivered on correctly.  I was hoping to really have an opportunity to try to find my way to a destination with minimal information, but mostly they give you no chance to get lost, so I spent my time trying to find the least hazardous route.  I can say the camera is awful and they could stand to add more variety to the road conditions, it seems like they decided Russia is all made of mud.  And really I find it hard to imagine a game like this releasing with basically no support for steering wheels, though it is less needed in this game then racing games, but still I bought the stupid wheel because it's the only thing that make driving games less likely to make me want to throw my controller.\n\nSo the fun parts, I really do think ultimately I like this game, but I do wish there was more of a "game" there, but maybe I just am not far enough yet.  I found the physics and the intense feeling as my big ugly truck hurtled down a hill I had no idea was there, to be pretty cool.  I think this game has a lot of potential and my hope is that they will continue to add content.  I don't like that this feels obviously like a game still in development, but was not indicated as such clearly, but that is the way of PC gaming now and I can't say there is any reason to wait any longer if you have been eyeing this, other then the price :)","July 3, 2014","true","7.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If you'd asked me if I'd like to chill out by driving Russian trucks through waist-deep mud, I probably would've looked at you funny, but there we are. In that sense I find it more similar to a game like Take On Mars than to another truck-themed game like Euro Truck Simulator. It also doesn't hurt if you think Russian military trucks are nifty.\n\nBut this game does not appear to be for everyone. If you are considering buying it, I'd advise waiting for a sale to bring it down to, say, the $15 range, and keep your finger on that refund button. It's also very interesting from a technical point of view, since, as far as I'm aware, there isn't another driving game that models offroad driving and terrain deformation in quite so much detail. As I've suggested earlier in the review, it's oddly relaxing watching your truck try to wade through fully deformable mud and water, and a small thrill when it manages to finally climb out the other side. Though, on the other hand, it's at first mildly frustrating getting bogged down in that same situation. I say at first because, like Kerbal Space Program, a short-term failure is merely an invitation to mount an elaborate rescue mission, and the scope of these rescue missions broadens when you introduce other players in co-op.\n\nThe developer and publisher have some issues with communication, and have suffered storms of drama in their relationship in the past, so the future of the game's development is far from bright. However, even with that, I think what's here (and what will be added in the upcoming, nearly-finished, update) is well worth the asking price when the game is discounted down to what I suggested.","August 13, 2015","true","100.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

It was well worth it and has something strangely addictive about it.\n\nNow lets talk about the details:\n\n- Graphics: The game looks stunning. The engine may have some flaws and its not 100% detailed but all in all it looks very convincing (which to me, is was matters most) and atmospheric.\n\n- Physics: Simply amazing. The mud-simulation is groudbreaking. Also very notable (and not mentioned as often) is the water simulation. Water currents are simulated. Water applies force to your vehicles in a very realistical way and you can even roughly estimate the depth of the water by looking at the way the ripples form on the surface.\n\n- Sound: Can't complain about it, the vehicles sound good. You even get to hear a knocking sound from your engine when the vehicle is heavily damaged. Environmental sounds are also pretty nice and create a convincing in-the-woods atmosphere.\n\n- Controls (driving): Takes a bit to get used to but overall they're pretty solid. The controls with a gamepad are also quite ok, however only the keyboard controls can be modified at the moment.\n\n- Camera: I agree with the others here that the camera movement feels very weird at first. Give it some time though and you'll get used to it. The system isn't so bad after all, though I assume that it was mainly built for use with a gamepad (with which it works pretty well).\n\n- Gameplay: I guess this comes down to personal preference. Spintires is quite challenging and you will only enjoy it if you like those challenges and if you enjoy fighting against the mud and overall harsh terrain. If you do however, you'll find that the game can be incredibly addictive.\n\n- Learning curve: Pretty steep to be honest. I agree that some sort of tutorial or a map that starts out with easy terrain would be needed. If you're not at least roughly familiar with driving in mud, you'd better learn it fast because that will be your first challenge.\nps.: I suggest starting on the "coast" map, that one is rather forgiving.\n\n- Multiplayer: Working together with a friend makes things alot easier and can be quite entertaining when something goes wrong. I'm surprised how well suited this game is for coop !\n\n\nps.: At time of wirting, steam isn't really the best place to buy this. Look around and you can get it significantly cheaper.","October 27, 2014","true","47.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The core content lasted me about 10hrs the mods is what got me this far. However thats where the good ends.\n\nThe bad: The devlopment of the game has constantly been one let down after another. The early patches came slowly (or so we thought we knew slow) and where bugged. New promises where made by said devloper and publisher and I refer to those two entities seppreatly because  they act as two sepperate things. Then came more delayed bugged patches which either released broken non working maps or broke game play entirely followed by severe conflict between Oovee the UK based Publisher and Pavle the Russian Devloper.  Then more promises made and and more let downs by both. The norm seems to be Pavel promises somthing then Oovee tells the forums about it then Pavel changes his mind posts his own stuff on an russian based media site and all the mud slinging repeats.\n\nThe Worse:\nPublisher has moderators running damage controlle on whats supposed to be official forums while Pavel posts updates on his own social media website(btw us english speaking peeps have to realy on google translate to even read those posts by pavel as he only posts in russian). Oovee asks player base for more faith but wont answer questions and gets upset at posts that rightfully question why we should give them more faith and time. The most recent update is over a month behind the worst case scenario time frame that was offered up by Oovee for an update. Also as mods are what keeps this going so well that the devloper and publisher have also made it so you cant post up some mods/websites because they use modding tools that where leaked by the angered Dev at one point in a fight bewteen the two.\n\nFinal Recommendation:\nDont buy the game as it seems the only way these guys will listen is if the money stops flowing and they are forced under or to grow up and man up to the promises they keep making.\n\nYou can find all the info I talked about and more on the official Forums here if you want to research this for yourself\nhttp://www.oovee.co.uk/forum/\nhttp://www.oovee.co.uk/forum/topic/11178-dev260515-outcome-of-second-meetings/\nhttp://www.oovee.co.uk/forum/topic/10987-mod-workshop-1st-look/","July 12, 2015","false","404.8"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","25","47","0","0"

One of the major things I believe should be implemented into the game is mods such as 4x4, etc. which should be enabled to be installed into the game without it stopping the gaining of achievements and game progression. I am aware that mods can be installed, but for the people like myself that aren't too computer inclined (but enjoy playing games) should be able to access an 'official' selection of 4x4 vehicles within the game that can be easily installed/removed and be used in the full game and are able to make progress, unlock achievements and be 'multiplayer'.\nIt is an excellent thing to hear animals when driving through the bush/wilderness, this is another aspect I believe would be a great addition to the surroundings and scenery. Even if there is no real intreaction with the animals, as we can hear them, it would be fantastic to see them (run accross a river or track, wild boar wallowing in mud, bear catching fish, fish).\n\nMy biggest recomendation for this game is that mods be available for multiplayer, be official, be easier to install (ex. in Portal 2 - levels/mods can be installed quickly and easily from within the game) and lastly to have some wildlife to really give this game a realistic feel to it.\n\nOverall, Fantastic game and hope the developers continue to upgrade and improve this game to full potential.\n(would recommend game to anyone)","January 10, 2015","true","93.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is easy enough for a newbie like myself. In the game, you will find yourself traversing the harshest terrain utilizing certain vehicles. ALthough, there is no set story line, there are several objectives in single-player. This can make the game a bit more relaxed, but the content isn't really there. Onto multiplayer, this is where the real content shines throuhg. I did not play much of it, but wthe games I joined had people completing the objectives, working together.

It has interesting ground deformation that simualtes mud better than any other game I've played.\n\nEven this early on this game is shining with potentail. Currently we only have 4 objectives per map; deliver lumber to the sawmills, uncloak the map, discover the extra trucks, and unlock all garages. And five mostly unique maps, I don't fully know how unique because after 40 hours of play I'm still playing around on the Coast map. As the game stands now I'd say it is well worth $30 but the Devs have proven diligent on this game and have delivered on thier promises thus far. They have promised more maps, more trucks, and more objectives. PLUS they are leaving the game open to the modding community. In just the tech demo alone modders created huge libraries of well built mods.\n\nThe bad, the camera controls are wonky and you can never seem to get the right view, the controls are rigid with only keyboard or xbox controls available (no steering wheels,) there are still some bugs with how collisions work and how the renders and with the latest hotpatch the biggest bug of getting your wheels stuck under the ground mesh seems solidly fixed.\n\nI foresee myself logging a lot of hours on this game\n","June 20, 2014","true","81.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silenkurii/recommended/263280/","Silenkurii","Sile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silenkurii/","151 products in account","The short version\nSpinTires is a quick and easy game to get into if you want some aimless fun exploring the map in a truck. With mud. And Trees.\n\nAdd in the 4 player multiplay and hilarity ensues as you bump someone off an embankment into the water, or get serious and work together to unlock all of the garages and trucks.\n\nIs it worth $30?\nIf you've ever wanted a free-roaming, off-road game with no timers or vehicles that require hours upon hours of grinding to unlock, then it's a solid price point.\n\nThe long version\nSpinTires has not changed very much since the demo release a couple of years ago. What you get in the released game is multiplayer, 5 new maps, half-a-dozen or so new trucks, new addons for the trucks, one objective to strive for (lumber transport) and some garages to unlock that are places around the map.\n\nMultiplayer is probably the biggest addition to the game which gives it some longevity. It's a basic lobby system where the game creator becomes the host of the game. While this works OK with your friends, it falls down when you join a random game. Unfortunately, all of your hard work will be undone as soon as the game host wants to leave. There's no saving, there's no swapping hosts or log out timers. It's just a sudden, and jarring disconnect from that game. The best advice would be to organise your own group of friends to play the game with.\n\nThe multiplayer chat is very basic and somewhat buggy. The default key for chat is Y, and sometimes when you're typing out a message, the chat bar will randomly disappear. Also, pressing Y to initiate chat will stop your truck. This can be very frustrating when you want to simply type "Yes" or "Thanks" and your truck stops dead. Opening the map also does this and is just as frustrating. There is no minimap and the compass is pretty useless. You really need the map to navigate efficiently, but doing this will also slow you down since it stops you in your tracks. A minimap would be ideal, or an option to have a transparent map overlay showing while you drive.\n\nThe next major additions are the maps and the trucks. The 5 maps included are all the same size, each with it's own theme. Volcano, The Plains, The Hill, etc, are all what they say. However, all the maps are just muddy tracks and lots of trees. They all look the same in colouring, textures and details. The short view distance and draw distance do nothing to help the maps look any different from one another and if you were put in a randome spot on each map, the likely hood that you could which map it is would be pretty high.\n\nThe trucks are all highly detailed and functional. There are some awesome addons for the trucks, particularly the crane which would have to be the best. You can fully operate the crane to pick up logs and load them into another truck. You can operate stabilizer bars to give your truck that extra stability it needs. The crane has full movement up and down, in and out and is trully a great addition. Log trailers are also pretty cool, adding a whole new level of skill required to take them through the tracks to a lumber yard. Once you load up a log trailer, you can immediately tell that you're carrying a lot of weight. The trailer is prone to tippping over a lot, so you have to drive slowly and skillfully. Reversing trailers has never been a strong point of mine in real life and I'm just as bad in SpinTires! Oh yeah, the trucks sound pretty good too.\n\nThe damage model is nice, but can be a little unpredictable and I think the damage model needs to be tweaked down a bit. It's very easy to damage your truck by hitting a bump in the road a bit fast. Sure, it's not ideal to go too fast on a track, but you should hardly take 50 damage. Damage seems to be hit and miss. Sometimes, you can drive into a tree and take no damage. Other times, you'll take damage. Sometimes it's minor, like say 2 damage. Other times it's 20 or more. It's all a bit too random and I really can't figure it out.\n\nMud hasn't changed since the demo except that there is more of it. It still looks like brown chunky polygons when it's churned up by your wheels and sometimes I think that it looks a little worse in the released version than it did in the demo. That's not confirmed though. Graphic anomolies aside, the mud is awesome. Never has a driving game done mud like this. Well, there was that one game that was severely disappointing in the end, but I wont mention any Off Road Drive games here. I'm really greatful that Oovee coded the winch into the game because far out, you'll need it to get out of the mud at times. Only the biggest and baddest trucks will drive straight through it but anything else, you'll have to be careful in which line you take. If you're in the Rover, your best bet is too hug the sides where there are plenty of trees to help you winch too.  If you tackle the middle of the muddy tracks, you'll most likely need a friend with you to help pull you out!\n\nThere's also water to contend with. One of the maps, The River, has.. would you believe it, a large river running through it, separating the map in two halves. Inevitably, you're going to have to cross it. Well, not have too, but want too! It's pretty awesome. The current is strong and if your truck goes too far under water, she'll suck in a few cylinders of water and sieze up. In reality, your truck just takes damage to the point where it no longer functions. It's nice though, it really adds a sense of urgency to get across. It's probably one of the only times where your butt grips your chair in the game.\n\nThe controls are standard fair. Keyboard and Mouse, or, Xbox 360 gamepad. There is no steering wheel support at present, but Oovee have seen the requests for it and I believe they are looking at adding support later on. There doesn't seem to be any rebinding of the gamepad buttons allowed yet. Hopefully, this will be patched in. Currently, if you're using the Xbox gamepad, your also using the mouse and the keyboard, too. Thats 3 peripherals folks! Yep. It's awkward and unintuitive but that's the design. Ideally, you would play SpinTires with keyboard and mouse only, as then you can do everything fairly easily. But I love kicking back with the gamepad and being able to finely adjust my steering with the thumbstick. Where it becomes clunky is, I have to put down my gamepad and use the mouse to operate the UI. So if I'm stuck, I have to put the gamepad down, grab the mouse, click the screen to get the cursor, click advanced, click a winch point on my truck, click a winch point on a tree/truck, then press 'F' to winch in (because I cannot bind winch in to the gamepad) and then, if I need to steer while winching, I have to try and grab the game pad and manouver with it awkwardly while holding F. Phew. Again, hopefully they patch this with another, more intuitive solution.\n\nThe camera can, and will be, annoying. The camera.. works. Some people like it, others hate it. I hate it. The camera can pan around your vehicle to get that view you want, but it also swivels unecessarily and can create more aggrivation than its worth.  I'd like to see some standard camera presets, like Chase, Top, Bumper/Bonnet, Side etc, as well as a free cam option where I can position the camera where I want to, and lock it if need be. That could easily be bound to the left thumbstick click down button. A lot of people want a cockpit view. It's going to be a while before we get a cockpit view, but how about a bonnet cam in the meantime?\n\nModding this game is where it will be at. The demo saw many, many different vehicle mods added to it and also some terrains. Currently, while you can mod the release version, it will probably be incompatible with multiplayer and Steam. Oovee have said that they are going to work on making mods compatible so that will be awesome.\n\nFor $30, it's great!","June 15, 2014","true","29.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My wife thinks I'm crazy for playing a game consisting entirely of driving trucks through the mud. Even my gamer buddies raise an eyebrow when I get excited about beating a map or figuring out some new strategy. All I can say is "play it and you'll understand." I paid full price for Spintires, and it's worth every penny to me. The gameplay is satisfying, slow-paced, and yet still challenging. The graphics are beautiful, and I have only run into a couple bugs. Also, the developers seem to be extremely committed to supporting this game with patches and new content. The only negative I have found is that there is a pretty steep learning curve getting started. However, between the game manual and some of the guides here on steam, you'll get the hang of it in no time. I would highly recommend this game.","July 2, 2014","true","250.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it is spectacularly beautiful; the lighting alone is impressive, but when you start to see the way the ground moves and the mud splatter interacts with the trucks you're just awed.  Also the steam on the engine is an impressive touch of realism that many other games miss out on when fording a river.\n\nThe games sole compromise to awesomeness at the moment is the camera.  It takes some time to get used to, and really requires the user to make very slow movements to remain in control of.  The number of maps thus far is as limited as some of the trucks but considering the game is still under development this and the winching abilities can be given some slack until the game is closer to being completely finished as the updates keep coming.\n\n\nI'd highly recommend the game, specially if you got some friends to help you sludge your way through the mud on multiplayer coops.","July 12, 2014","true","34.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are very good and the terrain deformation is second to none. The game also has good audio and physics for a driving sim. What really brings the game down is that it feels like a glorified tech demo. the camera is awkward and can be frustrating, and there is only one real objective; delivering lumber, and beyond that the game does little to keep you intertained, and has very little replay value. The game does feature 5 maps, however as you play through each one you will notice much of the terrain has been copy pasted several times. This is annoying because the maps really are not that big and you will notice when you see the same mud hole in four different places on the same map (really devs?). This game feels like its still in early access and for $30 you would expect a complete game.\n\nFor offroad enthusists and people who enjoy truck sims you will feel right at home being stuck in a mud pitt deep in the woods, but to the casual gamer this will a frustrating and annoying experience.\n","August 9, 2014","true","37.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silenkurii/recommended/263280/","Silenkurii","Sile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silenkurii/","151 products in account","The short version\nSpinTires is a quick and easy game to get into if you want some aimless fun exploring the map in a truck. With mud. And Trees.\n\nAdd in the 4 player multiplay and hilarity ensues as you bump someone off an embankment into the water, or get serious and work together to unlock all of the garages and trucks.\n\nIs it worth $30?\nIf you've ever wanted a free-roaming, off-road game with no timers or vehicles that require hours upon hours of grinding to unlock, then it's a solid price point.\n\nThe long version\nSpinTires has not changed very much since the demo release a couple of years ago. What you get in the released game is multiplayer, 5 new maps, half-a-dozen or so new trucks, new addons for the trucks, one objective to strive for (lumber transport) and some garages to unlock that are places around the map.\n\nMultiplayer is probably the biggest addition to the game which gives it some longevity. It's a basic lobby system where the game creator becomes the host of the game. While this works OK with your friends, it falls down when you join a random game. Unfortunately, all of your hard work will be undone as soon as the game host wants to leave. There's no saving, there's no swapping hosts or log out timers. It's just a sudden, and jarring disconnect from that game. The best advice would be to organise your own group of friends to play the game with.\n\nThe multiplayer chat is very basic and somewhat buggy. The default key for chat is Y, and sometimes when you're typing out a message, the chat bar will randomly disappear. Also, pressing Y to initiate chat will stop your truck. This can be very frustrating when you want to simply type "Yes" or "Thanks" and your truck stops dead. Opening the map also does this and is just as frustrating. There is no minimap and the compass is pretty useless. You really need the map to navigate efficiently, but doing this will also slow you down since it stops you in your tracks. A minimap would be ideal, or an option to have a transparent map overlay showing while you drive.\n\nThe next major additions are the maps and the trucks. The 5 maps included are all the same size, each with it's own theme. Volcano, The Plains, The Hill, etc, are all what they say. However, all the maps are just muddy tracks and lots of trees. They all look the same in colouring, textures and details. The short view distance and draw distance do nothing to help the maps look any different from one another and if you were put in a randome spot on each map, the likely hood that you could which map it is would be pretty high.\n\nThe trucks are all highly detailed and functional. There are some awesome addons for the trucks, particularly the crane which would have to be the best. You can fully operate the crane to pick up logs and load them into another truck. You can operate stabilizer bars to give your truck that extra stability it needs. The crane has full movement up and down, in and out and is trully a great addition. Log trailers are also pretty cool, adding a whole new level of skill required to take them through the tracks to a lumber yard. Once you load up a log trailer, you can immediately tell that you're carrying a lot of weight. The trailer is prone to tippping over a lot, so you have to drive slowly and skillfully. Reversing trailers has never been a strong point of mine in real life and I'm just as bad in SpinTires! Oh yeah, the trucks sound pretty good too.\n\nThe damage model is nice, but can be a little unpredictable and I think the damage model needs to be tweaked down a bit. It's very easy to damage your truck by hitting a bump in the road a bit fast. Sure, it's not ideal to go too fast on a track, but you should hardly take 50 damage. Damage seems to be hit and miss. Sometimes, you can drive into a tree and take no damage. Other times, you'll take damage. Sometimes it's minor, like say 2 damage. Other times it's 20 or more. It's all a bit too random and I really can't figure it out.\n\nMud hasn't changed since the demo except that there is more of it. It still looks like brown chunky polygons when it's churned up by your wheels and sometimes I think that it looks a little worse in the released version than it did in the demo. That's not confirmed though. Graphic anomolies aside, the mud is awesome. Never has a driving game done mud like this. Well, there was that one game that was severely disappointing in the end, but I wont mention any Off Road Drive games here. I'm really greatful that Oovee coded the winch into the game because far out, you'll need it to get out of the mud at times. Only the biggest and baddest trucks will drive straight through it but anything else, you'll have to be careful in which line you take. If you're in the Rover, your best bet is too hug the sides where there are plenty of trees to help you winch too.  If you tackle the middle of the muddy tracks, you'll most likely need a friend with you to help pull you out!\n\nThere's also water to contend with. One of the maps, The River, has.. would you believe it, a large river running through it, separating the map in two halves. Inevitably, you're going to have to cross it. Well, not have too, but want too! It's pretty awesome. The current is strong and if your truck goes too far under water, she'll suck in a few cylinders of water and sieze up. In reality, your truck just takes damage to the point where it no longer functions. It's nice though, it really adds a sense of urgency to get across. It's probably one of the only times where your butt grips your chair in the game.\n\nThe controls are standard fair. Keyboard and Mouse, or, Xbox 360 gamepad. There is no steering wheel support at present, but Oovee have seen the requests for it and I believe they are looking at adding support later on. There doesn't seem to be any rebinding of the gamepad buttons allowed yet. Hopefully, this will be patched in. Currently, if you're using the Xbox gamepad, your also using the mouse and the keyboard, too. Thats 3 peripherals folks! Yep. It's awkward and unintuitive but that's the design. Ideally, you would play SpinTires with keyboard and mouse only, as then you can do everything fairly easily. But I love kicking back with the gamepad and being able to finely adjust my steering with the thumbstick. Where it becomes clunky is, I have to put down my gamepad and use the mouse to operate the UI. So if I'm stuck, I have to put the gamepad down, grab the mouse, click the screen to get the cursor, click advanced, click a winch point on my truck, click a winch point on a tree/truck, then press 'F' to winch in (because I cannot bind winch in to the gamepad) and then, if I need to steer while winching, I have to try and grab the game pad and manouver with it awkwardly while holding F. Phew. Again, hopefully they patch this with another, more intuitive solution.\n\nThe camera can, and will be, annoying. The camera.. works. Some people like it, others hate it. I hate it. The camera can pan around your vehicle to get that view you want, but it also swivels unecessarily and can create more aggrivation than its worth.  I'd like to see some standard camera presets, like Chase, Top, Bumper/Bonnet, Side etc, as well as a free cam option where I can position the camera where I want to, and lock it if need be. That could easily be bound to the left thumbstick click down button. A lot of people want a cockpit view. It's going to be a while before we get a cockpit view, but how about a bonnet cam in the meantime?\n\nModding this game is where it will be at. The demo saw many, many different vehicle mods added to it and also some terrains. Currently, while you can mod the release version, it will probably be incompatible with multiplayer and Steam. Oovee have said that they are going to work on making mods compatible so that will be awesome.\n\nFor $30, it's great!","June 15, 2014","true","29.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of the major things I believe should be implemented into the game is mods such as 4x4, etc. which should be enabled to be installed into the game without it stopping the gaining of achievements and game progression. I am aware that mods can be installed, but for the people like myself that aren't too computer inclined (but enjoy playing games) should be able to access an 'official' selection of 4x4 vehicles within the game that can be easily installed/removed and be used in the full game and are able to make progress, unlock achievements and be 'multiplayer'.\nIt is an excellent thing to hear animals when driving through the bush/wilderness, this is another aspect I believe would be a great addition to the surroundings and scenery. Even if there is no real intreaction with the animals, as we can hear them, it would be fantastic to see them (run accross a river or track, wild boar wallowing in mud, bear catching fish, fish).\n\nMy biggest recomendation for this game is that mods be available for multiplayer, be official, be easier to install (ex. in Portal 2 - levels/mods can be installed quickly and easily from within the game) and lastly to have some wildlife to really give this game a realistic feel to it.\n\nOverall, Fantastic game and hope the developers continue to upgrade and improve this game to full potential.\n(would recommend game to anyone)","January 10, 2015","true","93.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Onto multiplayer, this is where the real content shines throuhg. I did not play much of it, but wthe games I joined had people completing the objectives, working together.

What I will do is tell you a story about just one of my experiences with the game:\n\nI was hauling a medium-sized load of logs to the drop-off point. My truck of choice for this job was a nice three-axle number called the C255. With locking differentials and six wheel drive, this thing was pulling the load with ease. This truck builds confidence – the kind of confidence that persuades a person to take a shortcut.\n\nIt looked safe enough at first: gentle rolling hills covered in deep emerald-green grass. However, the beauty of this pastoral scene belied the agonizing brown muck that lay just inches below those damp blades grass. Before I knew it, the C255 was buried up to the fenders. Those fat lumpy tires churned away at the mud like a mixer in cake batter, but the truck wouldn't budge. I tried reversing, turning, then forward again, over and over, and nothing worked. A scan of the surroundings for a winch anchor was fruitless. I was stranded in the middle of beautiful field of green grass that disguised the truck-swallowing mud beneath. A situation like this called for extreme measures.\n\nThe answer was the E7310. I call this bad boy the Behemoth. It's an 8x8 that's as big as two city buses and this thing does. not. get. stuck. Period. Which is good, because all it's really good for is rescuing other trucks that are stuck. Once I arrived on the scene, it was a simple matter of hooking up a tow line and away we go. It was at this point that I was reminded of an old saying about “best laid plans.”\n\nIn my eagerness to see how effective the Behemoth would be at towing my log truck out of the muck, I forgot to adjust the steering on the towed vehicle. As I'm pulling it out of the mud, one of the wheels gets hung on a rock, and the whole thing goes crashing over on its side. And there, scattered across those rolling green hills, were my precious logs. Oh, bother.\n\nFortunately, I had an answer for this as well. I brought in a third truck, another three-axle called the C4320. This one had the perfect attachment for my dilemma: a crane. With this handy-dandy I had the C255 upright and reloaded lickety-split, and the logs were delivered without further incident.\n\nNow, if a person were to experience the above-described scenario in real life, it would make for a pretty craptacular day. But doing it in this game, I was having a ball. This was truly one of my all-time best gaming moments. This game takes something that would drive a man to spit nails and makes it fun. Really fun. And that's what makes this game special.","September 5, 2014","true","50.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/recommended/263280/","Sevandres","Sevandres","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/","164 products in account","Spintires\nSpintires can simply be described as an off-roading simulator. You're driving Russian trucks in varied landscapes to achieve objectives. Simple enough, right? So what's included?\n\nThe vehicles, all of which have their unique feel to them, actually fight the terrain. If you're going up a hill and you get stuck in the mud with 2 wheel drive, you can bet your two pennies that your rear end is going to be sliding. If you're going over some rocks and you high center the truck, better hope to have a winch or the ability to reverse out. There are so many things to think about from watching how deep the river is that you're about to cross, to things like if the truck weighs too much for the questionable bridge you may be crossing. You really have to know how to manage your resources, and make the best with what you've got.\n\nThe game supports a Logitech G27 which made me feel like a kid at Christmas! With the G27 racing wheel, it feels realistic. When you go up a hill or hit a bump and the truck wants to steer one way, you will feel the wheel move in that direction, which is very cool. Of course you can adjust the wheel to your settings. You can use it with a manual shifting setup, or if you're a novice, you can still use it with the automatic shifting. Absolutely wonderful to have that option!\n\nSo what are the downsides? Well there's not a lot to do in this game. You explore to reveal the map, deliver some logs or other supplies, repair or refuel other trucks you might find, and that's basically it. Fortunately the maps are large, and there are a good handful of them to keep you busy, with some maps being much more difficult than others. Additionally there are difficulty settings which will change how your trucks get damaged via your driving.\n\nThere's no multiplayer. You cannot go out with your buddies off roading, or have your friend winch you out of that mud hole that you're stuck in. It's solely single player.\n\nLastly, the camera. There's no interior view, as the kick-starter for this game didn't make enough for it to be an included feature. The camera you have is very awkward and I've found myself stopping my truck just to reach over for the mouse and adjust the camera angle. It doesn't automatically move, at all. Additionally you only have two camera-settings to keybind. A Front/Back on/off toggle, and Trailer. That's literally it! The camera has been a real pet-peeve of mine. You might get around it but others, not so much.\n\nHowever, there is mod support for this game, and some mods might fix this camera issue, but I haven't found any success with that yet. You can modify this game with new maps, sounds, vehicles, textures, and other odds and ends. I haven't modded this game at all, so I can't confirm if modding this game is difficult or not.\n\nThis is a very promising and satisfying game. If you can get past the camera, you can sink a lot of your time into this. The biggest thing that makes me happy about the game (Other than the G27 support) is that it made you think. I have little to no off-roading experience, so it is very fun to figure out how a certain situation was going to turn out. Buy this game and give it a go, you won't be disappointed.","January 11, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are very good and the terrain deformation is second to none. The game also has good audio and physics for a driving sim. What really brings the game down is that it feels like a glorified tech demo. the camera is awkward and can be frustrating, and there is only one real objective; delivering lumber, and beyond that the game does little to keep you intertained, and has very little replay value. The game does feature 5 maps, however as you play through each one you will notice much of the terrain has been copy pasted several times. This is annoying because the maps really are not that big and you will notice when you see the same mud hole in four different places on the same map (really devs?). This game feels like its still in early access and for $30 you would expect a complete game.\n\nFor offroad enthusists and people who enjoy truck sims you will feel right at home being stuck in a mud pitt deep in the woods, but to the casual gamer this will a frustrating and annoying experience.\n","August 9, 2014","true","37.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Honestly one of my favorite things is playing with the log crane. Maybe I'm weird but I think its really fun straighting up the roads, picking up the rocks and moving them out of the way. I would love to see more missions than hauling logs, but it is pretty fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toolgump/recommended/263280/","toolgump","Kampmann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toolgump/","121 products in account","This game is hands down the best offroad simulation game I have ever played. The main reason is because of the technology used in the game to simulate the terrain. The ground contiually morphs as you drive through it and if you are by some body of water the grooves left from your vehicle will even fill up with some water. Playing this game really makes me feel like I am out in the mud and "spinning my tires". I bought this game because I enjoyed the tech demo and when I heard they were going to have multiplayer I knew I had to have it. I like playing with friends and family while sort of playing follow the leader as we take random trails throughout the map and wench each other out when needed. With all of this being said there are still some downsides. The first big one for me is the lack of objectives or content. Right now all there really is to do in the game is uncloak areas, unlock vehicles by driving up to them, and hauling logs from one spot to a next. I personally like to have some sort of progression system where I start off with maybe a couple vehicles and then complete some tasks where I then have to pay to unlock other vehicles or upgrades for vehicles. From there I would like to be able to complete different tasks such as maybe rescuing a stuck vehicle or moving other forms of freight. The camera right now is also very annoying but the developers have already mentioned that they will fix it. Obviosuly the game just released so there will be much more content coming out. In its current state it is very fun and I believe it will continue to get better.","June 20, 2014","true","48.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/recommended/263280/","Sevandres","Sevandres","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/","164 products in account","Spintires\nSpintires can simply be described as an off-roading simulator. You're driving Russian trucks in varied landscapes to achieve objectives. Simple enough, right? So what's included?\n\nThe vehicles, all of which have their unique feel to them, actually fight the terrain. If you're going up a hill and you get stuck in the mud with 2 wheel drive, you can bet your two pennies that your rear end is going to be sliding. If you're going over some rocks and you high center the truck, better hope to have a winch or the ability to reverse out. There are so many things to think about from watching how deep the river is that you're about to cross, to things like if the truck weighs too much for the questionable bridge you may be crossing. You really have to know how to manage your resources, and make the best with what you've got.\n\nThe game supports a Logitech G27 which made me feel like a kid at Christmas! With the G27 racing wheel, it feels realistic. When you go up a hill or hit a bump and the truck wants to steer one way, you will feel the wheel move in that direction, which is very cool. Of course you can adjust the wheel to your settings. You can use it with a manual shifting setup, or if you're a novice, you can still use it with the automatic shifting. Absolutely wonderful to have that option!\n\nSo what are the downsides? Well there's not a lot to do in this game. You explore to reveal the map, deliver some logs or other supplies, repair or refuel other trucks you might find, and that's basically it. Fortunately the maps are large, and there are a good handful of them to keep you busy, with some maps being much more difficult than others. Additionally there are difficulty settings which will change how your trucks get damaged via your driving.\n\nThere's no multiplayer. You cannot go out with your buddies off roading, or have your friend winch you out of that mud hole that you're stuck in. It's solely single player.\n\nLastly, the camera. There's no interior view, as the kick-starter for this game didn't make enough for it to be an included feature. The camera you have is very awkward and I've found myself stopping my truck just to reach over for the mouse and adjust the camera angle. It doesn't automatically move, at all. Additionally you only have two camera-settings to keybind. A Front/Back on/off toggle, and Trailer. That's literally it! The camera has been a real pet-peeve of mine. You might get around it but others, not so much.\n\nHowever, there is mod support for this game, and some mods might fix this camera issue, but I haven't found any success with that yet. You can modify this game with new maps, sounds, vehicles, textures, and other odds and ends. I haven't modded this game at all, so I can't confirm if modding this game is difficult or not.\n\nThis is a very promising and satisfying game. If you can get past the camera, you can sink a lot of your time into this. The biggest thing that makes me happy about the game (Other than the G27 support) is that it made you think. I have little to no off-roading experience, so it is very fun to figure out how a certain situation was going to turn out. Buy this game and give it a go, you won't be disappointed.","January 11, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Other then the fact the Developers seem to always be busy on vacations or in meetings, the rare occasion we get updates like the more recent one which added workshop support for vehicles is pretty good. They need to really get more maps included and workshop support for the modded maps asap, because this game's limited choice of 6 maps does get old rather quickly. The online multiplayer is pretty solid but it's menus are still very bare bones, and frustrating to use because you cannot name servers, and in general it just doesn't look very appealing. As far as networking goes, that is also something that's fairly broken and in about 30% of the times joining a server you will time-out or just freeze before loading the persons game.\n\nAll in all this game still rivals every other game for its mud physics which are quite amazing really and there's no other game on the market that pulls it off so perfectly. I really hope Rockstar games has seen this and taken note, games like gta could really use this procedual mud physics. Overall ill still give this game a 7/10 , as there's still much that's been promised and not fulfilled.","January 8","true","217.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

What I will do is tell you a story about just one of my experiences with the game:\n\nI was hauling a medium-sized load of logs to the drop-off point. My truck of choice for this job was a nice three-axle number called the C255. With locking differentials and six wheel drive, this thing was pulling the load with ease. This truck builds confidence – the kind of confidence that persuades a person to take a shortcut.\n\nIt looked safe enough at first: gentle rolling hills covered in deep emerald-green grass. However, the beauty of this pastoral scene belied the agonizing brown muck that lay just inches below those damp blades grass. Before I knew it, the C255 was buried up to the fenders. Those fat lumpy tires churned away at the mud like a mixer in cake batter, but the truck wouldn't budge. I tried reversing, turning, then forward again, over and over, and nothing worked. A scan of the surroundings for a winch anchor was fruitless. I was stranded in the middle of beautiful field of green grass that disguised the truck-swallowing mud beneath. A situation like this called for extreme measures.\n\nThe answer was the E7310. I call this bad boy the Behemoth. It's an 8x8 that's as big as two city buses and this thing does. not. get. stuck. Period. Which is good, because all it's really good for is rescuing other trucks that are stuck. Once I arrived on the scene, it was a simple matter of hooking up a tow line and away we go. It was at this point that I was reminded of an old saying about “best laid plans.”\n\nIn my eagerness to see how effective the Behemoth would be at towing my log truck out of the muck, I forgot to adjust the steering on the towed vehicle. As I'm pulling it out of the mud, one of the wheels gets hung on a rock, and the whole thing goes crashing over on its side. And there, scattered across those rolling green hills, were my precious logs. Oh, bother.\n\nFortunately, I had an answer for this as well. I brought in a third truck, another three-axle called the C4320. This one had the perfect attachment for my dilemma: a crane. With this handy-dandy I had the C255 upright and reloaded lickety-split, and the logs were delivered without further incident.\n\nNow, if a person were to experience the above-described scenario in real life, it would make for a pretty craptacular day. But doing it in this game, I was having a ball. This was truly one of my all-time best gaming moments. This game takes something that would drive a man to spit nails and makes it fun. Really fun. And that's what makes this game special.","September 5, 2014","true","50.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What's more, player's attitudes toward this are fantastic. Never have I met a nicer bunch of people than on a Spintires multiplayer game, where after completing the map everyone thanked me just for hosting the server! Another time I played with three Russians, not speaking a word of their language, and we all knew exactly what to do, helping each other out of the stickiest situations.

If you admire old solid trucks from Soviet era that you can fix with just a hammer, it's a cherry on top. In contrast, if you are after BAJA race-like game then this is not what you're looking for (at least till modding community gets its hands on it properly).\n\nLookup some gameplay videos on youtube, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrYr5SzGoS8\nIf you like what you see when others play it, you will enjoy the game.\n\n-------------\nSome details:\n\nIt is quite difficult even on "casual" settings and you need to think before you drive into something. It's prudent to check the game manual or some tutorials to find out how to use all wheels drive, differential lock and winch, otherwise you may end up stuck 10 seconds after leaving your garage.\n\nYes, the camera sucks and could do with some tweaks at least (which devs already promised to do), but even in it's current form you can live with it. It takes some getting used to but in the end you will learn how to tame it (I have tried just keyboard and mouse controls though).\n\nIt lasts to be an exciting challenge for some 15-20 hours of singleplayer (roughly the time it takes to complete all maps at causal diff.), after that it can get repetitive for some people (it's always: explore map + unlock goodies -> find easiest route -> make 2-4 trips with logs). I suppose you could repeat all that on Hard, but given that you will know the maps already and remember how to avoid mud traps... Hopefully we will see some more content added and also stuff from modding community that will extend the playability.\n\nAs for multiplayer, I haven't tried myself yet but from what I have seen on youtube it can be even more fun.\n\nOther things that are slightly annoing but probably won't spoil your first 20 hours:\n- You can't save progress on each map independently (devs promised to fix this though)\n- Once you finish a map it resets and is "cloaked" again\n- Multiplayer doesn't sync all sounds (will hopefully be fixed in future updates)","June 28, 2014","true","59.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I can't think of anything that I dislike about it really. Sure it isn't a deeply featured game (take this and that, from here to there, get stuck a lot), but the beauty is in its simplicity. I have almost completed all objectives in the Coast map on hardcore difficulty, and three of us managed to complete all objectives in the River map in much less time on normal difficulty. There are still many maps which offer small variations in difficulty if I should wish to play more. At the moment I actually feel pretty satisfied and could walk away without regret. I purchased for $10 when it was on sale. I'm not sure I would spend more than $15.\n\nMy favorite thing so far has been recovering spilled logs. When I was still getting the hang of things, I tipped over a few times, which can cause a load of logs to be dropped. Some trucks have a crane attachment that lets you pick up the logs and sort of place them back in the truck bed or within the cart, and once you have enough of them alligned you can recover the load and continue on your way to the objective.\n\nMy least favorite thing has to be the camera. It feels like leftover code from when the software was intended as a tech showcase. It is very impractical when you're actually trying to survey the environment.","December 27, 2014","true","41.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have mostly played this with my friend and we've had great time playing this together. Terrain is really well made and water is animated really well. Game itself has only one object: transport lumber from pile to saw. But even this isn't as easy as you could imagine. When you have cargo and trailer, it gets much more difficult to drive in mud. And if you want to make transporting lumber more easier, you should reveal all cloack points from map and that can also be quite challengin. As I said, truly awesome game.\n\n\nEDIT:  As the game has been updated, I think it's time to update my review. What the game was missing (in my opinion) was cabin view. Now there is new view (or it has been a while): roof. This really helps driving the trucks around.\n\nI have also started to use Xbox 360 controller and it has made steering bit easier. I'm not sure if this is new feature or I just haven't found it earlier but I really like the way that torque is transmitted to wheels. The less you press gas, the more torque is applied. Just like in real life. This ability really helps when driving in muddy conditions because tires have more grip.\n\n\nI continue to update my review as I see it is needed.","January 10, 2015","true","37.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everyting in the world is realistic; squishy mud, rolling rocks, bending shrubs and even trees that sway, wobble, and break! Yes, you heard me right, when you crash into trees, they actually move! I don't know why other games have stupid static trees that have no affect when you crash into them. The physics are definitely what makes this game amazing, but that is not all.\n\n-Trucks\nAlthough there are only seven trucks in the game, they are all extremely well modeled and detailed, and each truck is very different. It is a great experience discovering all the trucks on the map, and then learning the best uses for each one. Plus the trucks are all Russian, so, yeah, automattically amazing.\n\n-Maps\nThe five maps on the game are all very diverse. Five may seem like a small number, but each one of the maps is HUGE. Also, each map is very different to explore. There are many different buildings, landmarks, and natural landforms on every map. The "cloaking" system on the maps adds a unique challenge to the game. The only unfortunate thing about the maps is that only one map can be save =d at a time, so if you start a new map, everything you did on the other map will be erased. Hopefully this will be changed soon.\n\n-Multiplayer\nI didn't go into this game expecting great multiplayer. I was pleasantly surprised, though, when I saw how well the multiplayer worked. It was very easy to do, and it makes the game even better playing with other people. This game is very good when teamwork is put into effect; each person can try to conquer a different task on the map, and if somebody gets stuck in the mud, you can help them by attaching your winch to them. Playing Spintires on multiplayer is just a fun and interesting way to collaborate and work together, and believe it or not, it is actually awesome.\n\nSUMMARY (TL;DR)\nSpintires is an amazing offroad driving simulator, with extremely realistic physics, trucks, and maps. It also has great, easy, and fun to use multiplayer.\n\nI believe this game is already fantastic, but I do still have high hopes for whatever changes will occur to it in the future!\n\nFinal Score: 8.9/10","November 1, 2014","true","19.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

The worst communication from a game publisher I've ever seen. Ever.\nThis game is infact unfinished. Don't let anyone fool you into beliving it is. It left early access about a year ago, and in that time, more bugs and issues have been made by the very few tiny updates than have been fixed. Then to make things worse, They have gone to extream measures to stop modders from fixing bugs, making maps, add objectives and new trucks. Currently, there is only one objective type, of the many promiced, which is hauling logs. The multiplayer mode is horribly broken and not playble for most players.\nAt this point, the free tech demo is just as playble and has a ton of mods. Don't give OOVEE a single cent. This game has sold so many copies, they could have hired a new tech team from scratch to fix and finish this game and still have their hottubs full of money. They rarely communicate any information other than you will burn in hell for making mods, to the point that the forum mods only apologize for how badly Oovee is handling all this.\n\nIt would take so little effort from Oovee to fix this game, and their reputation, its insulting. To the point that not only will I never buy another product from them, will never stop telling people to avoid them, but when this company eventually rebrands/renames it self, I will be the first to stand up and be the biggest voice to tell people not buy their games.\n\nOovee, I only hope you go away and never publish another game again.","September 19, 2015","false","108.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

They added the ability to add new vehicles from the workshop but there is nearly no ability or support to use them on maps outside of the practice area.  You may get lucky with 1 out of 20 vehicles actually working on a single player map. But you are doomed to crash 3 minutes later anyway.

Graphics are amazingly done and the newly emplemented Wheel Support is amazing and allow for even more realistic gameplay. The goal is simple but hard enough to make it challenging even with a full team. Cooperation is something useful and really does help.\n\nThere is currently 5 maps which all offer different difficulty. After a while you might get tired of these. Hopefully Devs will implement more in time. 7  Trucks in game all with their up and downs. More truck incoming from what we've heard.

You have to drive slowly and face it the trucks dont move that fast even when you do try lol . Add the winch mechanics to get you out of a jam which you will frequently and you have a really enjoyable game that gives you a real sense of achievemnt when you end up with a truck wedged in and either winch your way out or bring in another truck to help . Brains are needed to get anywhere with this . It isnt perfect the cloaked areas you have to drive to the exact centre of can be a nightmare to get to and there is next to no documentation on how to do things .

So I am an advent off-road driver. And I saw this game for $30. But I didn't feel like it was worth that much so I waited it out and bought it on sale. Needless to say, it would have been worth the full price.\n\nIt is a great game, and down to the point, here is the pros and the cons.\n\nPros:\n-Enviroment. Both visually attractive, yet functional. The ground reacts properly, and it is far from plain.\n-The Vehicles. Great array of vehicles to select from. Sure given the time period and point of game, you can't get a Jeep. But they are beautifully done, with their own perks and downsides.\n-Customization. You can do up your vehicles with what ever you may need to get the job done.\n-Physics. They're great. Muddy tires don't always get traction, and the more kit you have on your vehicle, the heavier and more likely it bogs down.\n-The Gameplay. Though they could have just cheaped out and made it so you just get to bog around. They added actual objectives, and side objectibes to complete. This makes the game far more interesting.\n\nCons:\n-Camera Angels. Worst camera angels ever. I sent one of my fully loaded trucks down a cliff because I couldn't angel the camera to see what was directly in front of me.\n-Sound. Though the actual sound of what's going on in the game is awesome, it would be nice if you could set up a playlist or something.\n\nEither way, I look forwards to what more this game has to offer. I hope they will release Allied and other countries vehicles with more maps in the near future (for a reasonable price of course).\n\nSo if you're like me and like to off-road, this games for you. The bonus is, it's still cheaper than doing it with your own vehicle!","October 31, 2014","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are just as they are seen in the trailer therfore amazing. The gameplay itself is also very good. There are many maps to choose from and the objectives seem to take quite a while so there is lots to do including unlocking trucks and unlocking cloaks. The trucks on the game are very customizable and depending on the truck your using can really depend on how easy or hard it is to control. I've come into various scenarios where I have had to use another truck or a tree to wrench myself out of deep dirt or rivers which is always quite good fun. I haven't completed the first map yet so it should be fun to try out the other maps. I'm also yet to try the multiplayer mode in this game which looking at a couple of gameplays look good.\n\nThe only downside to the game, is that it is quite demanding (for me anyway). Basically, you'll want a dedicated graphics card to run this game on high settings. I have put most of my settings on medium or low and it works well however. I still need to purchase a graphics card at some point so I can play this as well as many other games on high graphic settings.\n\nOverall, it seems to be a fun game and the fact I got it for £11.99 (I think) was certainly worth it. Not sure I'd want to pay full price though. In my opinion, wait for it to pop up in a sale again (as I do with just about all games).","October 31, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is very slow paced and you will find yourself stuck in mud trying to get out more than you will actually find yourself driving.  But thats all the fun of the game, after youve beet working for 20+ minutes with your friends trying to escape a certain mudhole, the feeling is amazing.  Maps are fun, though I would like to see more diversity in some of the future DLC's they Devs are planning on, all the maps as of now are all muggy and wet in a forest area.  I would like to see something like the desert dunes or snowy alaska, maube even some rack crawling jeeps added into the game for some different type of gameplay, rather than just slow moving jeeps/ 8 wheelers.  You can easily fix that though by downloading a few mods which add some very nice vehicles to the game, be warned, after a mod is downloaded you will not be able to play multiplayer so back up your game files before downloading them.  8/10 strongly recommend, escpecially for fun times with your friends!","November 8, 2014","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The terrain melts like realistic butter under your 5 ft diamter tires as you struggle against that ♥♥♥♥♥, nature. You ford rivers and climb over mountains in your soviet era monster truck as you try to piece together the story. The Russian outback is a post apocalyptic mud factory covered in "cloaking" which you must overcome by actually getting places, which is much harder than it sounds. After setting up your own objects, cause ♥♥♥♥ you the game is not going to give you any, you trek into the woods in search of the Lumber Camp. After finally getting the the camp you will realize you are not equiped to do anything there at all. Thats right yopu naive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, You will need like 3 or 4 trucks there equiped with trailers, cranes, extra fuel tanks, and repair attachments, and that is just scratching the surface. Getting that stuff there is going to be really hard. You'll have to unlock trucks and attachemnts as you go and expolore more of the map. If there was some sort of Truck Dark Souls; This is it! Perhaps Lofty praise, but the game seems to just lay out some mechanics and let you go off into the world and try and exploit them as you tackle and unforgiving environment. Visually the game is absolutely stunning, not all the textures are really that sharp or impressive but all the ones that count are. The Deformation of the terrain is strangely hypnotic. Every instant looks like a Bob Ross painting except there is a badass truck ripping through the center of it!  If you think trucks are rad, or have any interest in off-roading, then this is the game for you.

This is pretty much the best true off-road simulator you'll find but bear in mind its NOT A RACING GAME. Speed is not the name of the game here but rather realistic navigation of a deep Russian forest! You've got mud, pools/streams/rivers/oceans of water, steep inclines, dried out riverbeds, dense forests, sharp switchbacks up a mountain side... a good variety of terrain.\n\nThe game is incredibly simple in its objectives but its just plain fun to set out on a new map and find the best routes to load up and then deliver loads of lumber. Yes, thats the current way to "beat" the maps - you need to load lumber either with a crane or by going to specific lumber yards and loading up on short, medium or long logs and then hauling them across the map to drop points.\n\nAND THE PHYSICS! Damn, best mud and water physics I've seen for a driving game. Your tires will dig massive ruts, water has realistic currents and will flow even between your tires... its amazing. Where there was once a pristine trail could become a muddy hell at the end of the map after you've hauled heavy loads through it.\n\nAs for the vehicles you've got an assortment of Russian trucks such as an old dually, a recon jeep and then you can even get up to massive 8x8 rolling fortresses that can only be stopped by the worst mud pits imaginable. Speaking of that recon jeep, each map starts out cloaked in black swirls/clouds that prevent you from seeing all the map right away. The cloaks can be removed simply by moving near them but they are often hidden away in deep forest/rough terrain and its pretty fun to scout out the unkown with your trusty jeep and reveal the map!\n\nThe devs totally plan on supporting the game into the future and will be surely adding new trucks, maps and even new objectives/features so this already simple but fun game will become even greater with time!","August 5, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Camera is wonky at times but once you get used to it and moving it around its not too bad. would be cool if there were weather effects, snow, rain etc.  multiplayer is  pretty good though a proximity microphone chat feature would be good when traveling in a caravan, you cant type and drive at the same time. Took me about 12.5 hours to beat the first map and that is on casual mode.  there were a lot of rescue to garages for sure.  THe learning curve is a little bit steep as far as learning the capabilities of each truck and which routes to take.  None-the-less it is a very fun game that actually has a lot of strategy in it.

Laughing at the same time at how I could go and ♥♥♥♥ up so fast.\n\nAnyway, I do what anyone would do, I hit every key looking for the chat button, "Ah, it's Y", I think to myself.  I then proceeded to plead to my comrades to save me!\n\nIn the effort to save me, my friend Crevarski gets pulled over the edge of the hill and ends up stuck at the bottom of it, ensnared by all the surrounding stones deeper in the pit.\n\nThis was, as you might assume, was unbelievably hilarious.\n\nWe then both proceed to beg for the random player to save us.\n\nIn his attempts to save us, he is then also pulled off the cliff, just to roll onto his roof on top of me.\n\nThis led to tears of laughter on my end.\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes, I knew my money was well invested, just because I've never laughed so much at having a lack of understanding the game.  The game is just hilarious as you go from blunder to blunder, stalling engines in every possible way possible for the first few hours.\n\nOnce you're past that part of the game, and you start getting good at traversing the environment in your behemoths, it occurs to you that 1 truck is not going to cut it when tackling this unforgiving terrain!  Leading you to try and get a team sorted, where you'll have to assign everyone a task.  Such as 2 log haulers, and the other 2 as the support, dealing in the winching, repairing and refueling!\n\n(For those of you that don't enjoy multiplayer, you can switch to any truck unlocked at any time to go and save the one you just drowned in 'quick-mud')\n\nAnyway, this game is so unbelievably addictive, not just for the strangely addictive gameplay, but for the amount of teamwork that is required for a driving simulator, that even the 'crème de la crème' of driving games manage to skim the surface of.\n\nPlus, with the game being relatively new, I will ignore its minor flaws, such as the camera being annoying at times, and a few missing options that would of been nice, but aren't exactly going to ruin your time, as I'm sure most of these annoyances will be addressed very soon!\n\nI would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone that is interested in off-roading 'AND' games like Euro Truck Simulator.\n\n8.5/10","June 14, 2014","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If, however, you like the sound of crawling along at single digit speeds in an old Soviet truck that gets stuck easily, then look no further.\n\nIn summary, Spintires won't be for everyone. If you're like myself and enjoy a good sim then I highly recommend you give this game a chance. The one (and currently only) objective on each map is to deliver 8 pieces of lumber from one end of the map to the other. Where the fun begins is how the maps react to your vehicles. The mud is the star of the show, without a doubt. If you repeatedly use a particular track, it will get more and more churned up and become increasingly difficult to use. There are further obstacles to contend with such as fast flowing rivers, steep adverse cambers and narrow forested tracks.\n\nThe vehicles are lovingly modelled and all of them offer some benefit over the others. You don't start a level with all the available vehicles for that map unlocked. They are often hidden in the wilderness. And then when you do find them, they will regularly need repairing or fuelling, or sometimes even both.\n\nThe multiplayer makes completing the objectives a lot easier as you can move in convoy and help each other out but some maps are still very difficult.\n\nWhile this game still has a long way to go to being called complete, I love it already. Completing a level is very satisfying and the physics are modelled beautifully. I'd highly recommend you give it a shot.","July 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the hauling trucks surpass 6 tons easily, and are over 7 feet in height, if you don't believe me, search Russian loggingg trucks and just look.\n\nAnyways, onto the review.\n\nThis game is really a peice of work, made by 2 people in Britian it takes place in Russia where you trade your time to deliver loads of logs to various objectives on 6 maps (more to come!). There is currently 2 gamemodes to choose from, casual and hardcore, both varying in features. In casual you can rescue trucks to a garage, in hardcore you cannot. Gas use in casual is little to none, in hardcore, you better have a fuel truck handy. Multiplayer is supported for 4-players at the time, and works best with people you know and can use a VoIP service with.\n\nSome counter-arguements for peoples dislikes:\n\nCamera: I honestly think the camera is part of the experience. And the views are some what odd, but you can toggle free view and lock it to where you like by clicking, and reset it by pressing "1". Could use some work, but if this is making you not buy the game, then your an a**hat.\n\nPrice: Yes, the $30 price can seem a bit steep, but I think you can seriously enjoy the game with your friends. I put in 8 hours the first day I got this game, and I do not regret it at all. You seriously can get sucked into this logging enviroment.\n\nNo 1st Person View: Seriously, is this keeping you from buying this?! Don't be such a panzy. Surely you have played a game with no 1st person view before, and it was just fine (GTA sound familiar). Like I said, don't be a panzy.\n\nAll-in-all, the game is really going well for less than 2 months on Steam, and being developed by 2 people, it's really just amazing to see this.\n\nDo yourself a favor, buy the game, and don't be a panzy because there is no 1st person view, or something stupid of the sort.","July 3, 2014","true","68.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a reason the trucks are big and beefy, they have to be to have any hope.\n\nGreat fun, great physics engine and the game is very immersive.  Once you get the hang of it, it is both fun and relaxing at the same time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moggz/recommended/263280/","moggz","Moggz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moggz/","8 products in account","This review is based on the game as it came at the time I bought it (a few days ago) including all updates and patches that it would've had at that time.\n\nIf you like the concept of this game and enjoy simulators then I doubt this game will disappoint. The graphics are gorgeous. The way the vehicles cut through the mud, brush past trees and slosh through water is all done superbly. I have never known another game that comes even close to simulating ground deformation in this way. The more you drive the tracks in big trucks, the more tricky sections can become churned up, giving you increasing challenges to get through. The level of detail on the vehicles is brilliant - swinging ropes, moving running gear, smoke and heat effects - it's all there. Although one thing that isn't there is any drivers. It seems a shame that in such an immersive simulator as this, the trucks appear to be just driving around magically by themselves. In terms of game-play, having a certain number of 'drivers' to use per map might have been a nice touch, but it's still a fantastic game even with innumerable invisible drivers.\n\nThere's no music and it doesn't need any. The sounds of the vehicles are spot on. The roar of the really big diesel engines is throaty and satisfying, the transmission whines on the little Uaz truck and the thudding and clunking as you crawl over rough terrain is just right. The ambient sounds are also great. It's a bit like a sounds of nature relaxation CD (until you fire-up a truck of course).\n\nThe maps are all very similar in visual appearance and there are no weather effects, just day & night, but each contains unique challenges.\n\nWithin minutes of playing the game I hated the two camera views. The fixed 3rd person view seems useless, most of the time all you can see in this view is the back of the truck. The mouse-controlled view is the one to use, but it seems to be anchored to the truck in a strange place so it rotates awkwardly, it doesn't zoom out far enough, and when you do zoom out it automatically zooms back in again after a few seconds. Within hours of playing the game, I'd got used to the awkward camera angle and reconciled that when you're off-roading, you don't get to see all around the vehicle, or which way the steering wheels are turning etc. After continued playing the camera angle bothers me far less, but it would still be nice to zoom out more.\n\nIf you like driving big trucks off road and have perhaps longed for a game that effectively simulates mud when off-road driving (which I have), then this is possibly the greatest game ever made. There is plenty to do so long as you enjoy the concept - scouting the terrain to uncloak the map, locating, repairing and refuelling additional trucks, keeping all your trucks fuelled and repaired, towing and winch recovery, setting up new garages and collecting and delivering loads of timber. The two main styles of play I have found so far have been scouting in the small truck, which gives a 'trials' type off-roading experience, picking the best route across terrain with no tracks, finding gaps to wind through trees, pushing through scrub and wading through uncharted depths. Then there's the more 'convoy' style of driving. Perhaps taking a couple of log trucks and a fuel tanker along wide (or at least, the widest you can manage to find) forestry tracks, using the vehicles together to find the best routes and recover, winch and tow each other when needed (and trying not to get all 3 of them stuck).\n\nHowever, if you just go out and drive in a truck to try and get from A to B, then auto-restore your vehicle back to the starting point if you crash and try over, you'll probably get bored quickly. I think you need to actually enjoy trying to recover stuck vehicles to appreciate this game, it's as much about vehicle recovery and problem solving as it is about driving.\n\nMoving long trailer loads is a nightmare, and that's exactly how it should be. It's incredibly challenging and rewarding to take big curtain sided trailers or long loads of logs from A to B without spilling the load, inching forward and back at corners to get the right angle, winching up muddy inclines and nervously crawling through water crossings.\n\nI don't even want to mention mods because this game is amazing without them, but I've gone and mentioned them now. Mods would be nice. It'd be nice to be able to add vehicles without them replacing existing vehicles in the game, and to get some new maps with a different look to them. But really, if you want to drive big trucks in mud, then this game allows you to just that, and it does so brilliantly.","March 11, 2015","true","410.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the maps offer even 2 delivery points for lumber and 1 or more pickup points. So to keep being entertained for a longer while you need to be able to set yourself some goals as well, like getting the Steam Achievements.\n\nNow that the warning is out of the way for people that need goals, let's go into the game itself.\n\nPros:\n+ Off roading with big and heavy machines!\n+ Vehicle configuration options while at garages\n+ Can also load up from alternative lumber points using a crane\n+ Hours of fun completing several different maps each with their own difficulties\n+ More hours of fun completing the achievements\n+ Even more hours of fun doing all of the above in Multiplayer\n+ Pretty ok physics on different types of terrain\n+ Running over (small) trees\n+ Disturb nature with your horn!\n+ Build custom bridges with lumber using the crane!\n+ Contrary to some older forum discussions, this game is actually supported by a development team and is being updated from time to time.\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes it can get frustrating being bogged down in places where you'd not expect it because of terrain surface (after a while of playing you will start reckognise hard vs soggy surfaces).\n- Some of the C-type trucks become nearly uncontrollable with medium size logs. They just sink away unevenly a lot and capsize easily.\n- The amount of maps when you start out is ok, but more would be welcome. Or even perhaps a map editing tool would be a nice addition to the game so people can make custom maps\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game to people with an interest in Simulation of off roading with heavy machinery.","March 15, 2015","true","68.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is good, it is holy. You will forget that you are not actually a soviet truck driver who delivers logs. Side effects may include but are not limited to: disappearance of social life, failing your finals, forgetting the name your parents, doubting reality, starvation, sleep deprivation and loss of the ability to speak.\n\nSeriously though. You better download the free tech demo before buying the game because it's the kind of gameplay one either loves or hates. There is no doubt that if you like it, it will be  one of the most immersive experience you can get from an open-world game and it allows you to complete a level by any means you like, either by using a very powerful truck with like 14 wheels or a crappy old truck which doesn't even have 4-wheel drive.\n\nIf you like the tech demo, this game is a must-buy. I can't wait to see what features we shall get now that development is back on track.\n\nThe game does need a few additions and tweaks, such as the possibility of having a flat-bed trailer so you can carry your trucks around, a digger would be nice so you can fix some roads and make bridges and the 3rd person view does need some improvement. Oh and if they could add a 1st person view inside the cabin, like EuroTruck simulator, that's would be amazing!","March 12, 2015","true","125.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will need to think how you cross a ravine or a creek in order to not get stuck without ever using your winch. the physics are great, the game play is amazing. the develoers are wonderful that they update the game when they see something is wrong. 10/10","March 25, 2015","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
