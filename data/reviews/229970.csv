The game is fun to play and moddable. However once you hit turn 200 or colonize 20 planets (this is RAM dependent I found out(16gb, at 32gb you can colonize upto 30-50 planets maybe)) the game has a dramatic slow down in game play. At this point you'll mostly be waiting on the Resource or Population Manager, often times 20 mins plus for your turn to come up. At turn 200, I was just getting into the game and having fun. So I checked if there was a fix for this. No fix. Per the developers, the game is not designed to be played for long periods or for you to colonize every planet in sight. I usually won the game after 30-45 minutes of game play, often winning before I ever met another race, having gotten bored with that, I modded the victory conditions for more time. What's the point of having a universe with hundreds of planets, but if you colonize more then 20 planets, the game becomes unplayable with long periods (many minutes waiting on the AI to complete processing your turn) between turns. Eventually you'll get tired of waiting and hit crl+alt+del, kill the game and go play something else.\n\nThe other thing is that diplomacy is a joke. The ai will attack you, make peace, agree not to attack you for 20 turns, 5 turns later will attack you again, make peace, make you an ally, attack someone else, you'll attack the enemy of your ally, they'll make peace, you won't even know they made peace, etc. Or you can attack another race, make peace, attack them again, make peace, etc. If a planet has too amny defesnses, buy the planet, the ai will sell any planet they have except their home base. Hey, there's an invasion fleet at your planet, just buy their ships if you have the cash.\n\nIf you manage to wipe out a race, they'll become friendly and start asking you for tech, even though they don't have any ships or planets and you've completely wiped them out.\n\nI've never been able to get thru all the techs in the game, just takes to long to research them and playing with the default game without modding, you'll just barely scratch the surface. Once you've researched every tech in a particular catagory, it would have been nice to get a messages about it, but you don't so you have to keep checking and then remember to go thru every planet and delete that type of research facility. I have noticed from conquered planets that the ai does not have the same limitations as you do when it comes to building research facilities. So the top tier reseach facility, you can only build 1 for your empire, where as the ai can build 4 per planet. And on top of that, the ai will always be willing to sell you any tech that you don't have and they've researched.\n\nTHere really isn't much difference between the standard game and the gold edition. This game stil lhas all the bugs it did in the original, all they did was add about 2 buildings as far as I can tell.\n\nWhen I bought the gold version on Steam, I was hoping that the bugs and gameplay had been fixed, but I came to find out nothing has changed. Luckly i got it for around $4 so it's no that big of a loss, definitively not worth $20.\n\nSo all in all the game is fun in the beginning, is moddable, but has too many issues to keep you inteserested for any length of time.\n\nUpdate:\nI'd like to note that most of my playtime is watching TV and waiting for my turn","February 5, 2015","false","274.6"," 73 of 84 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","73","84","8","0"

Most of the reviews I've read aren't even aware that this is an unpdate of a game so old is pre-dates MOO and MOO2.  So to compare this with the MOO games isn't really fair, since it's just as likely MOO took ideas from the old Armada 2525.\n\nThere are some great features to the game.  In particular, the events notifications after each turn allows itself to be used as a sort of checklist when resolving issues, in a way that not even the new Civ games do.  However, there are several tedious features.  Moving population around planets is necessary, and it just takes a little too long to issue each transport command.  The issues are minor, such as having to move the mouse far across the screen, instead of having common commands set right next to each other.  So it isn't awful, just a little tiring to me after some hours of play.\n\nAlien races keep spamming me with requests and deal offers, and there is no way to stop them.  Unfortunately, most of the offers just aren't that important.  I finally declared war on one race to stop their nagging, which reduced communications to a series of offers for peace.  The aliens will also sometimes park on your planets, doing no harm, but causing the game to prompt you to declare war every single turn, which also gets tedious.\n\nThis is basically a good, relatively simple sci fi 4x game that probably has some good strategy.  But the polish isn't there, for me.  The pace of play tends to tire me rather than energize me.  So I recommend avoiding it, although it might be enjoyable if you are really interested in 4x sci fi games, of which there are not enough.\n\nI have only played the Gold edition.  Based on the new features list, I would avoid the regular edition and only buy the gold, if you do buy it.  It adds quite a lot.\n\nUpdate:  Okay, I changed my mind.  But with some caveats.  The game is funny, quirky, and easy to mod.  If you like exploring a game to see what makes it tick, and if you don't take it too seriously, this might be a good buy.  The problems I mentioned lessen as the game progresses, and there are many ways to win.  Myself, I have made small changes to the random planet generation to reduce the number of useless planets.  It appears to have been made by one person, which I find quite admirable.  It isn't really polished, but it has a good heart.","May 12, 2014","true","3.2"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","52","57","2","7"

Alothough there are only 18 different alien races, there are several other factions with differnt perks than the main branch of that race. The map designer enpowers you to create just about any galaxy you heart desires and choose the riches at each planet. The only down falls to this game may be that the game can become a little monotonous after 200 turns if you don't set new goals for your-self and time between turns can be long if you are playing with a lot of races. Above all the game provides a wide variety of stratagies to conqur the galaxy.","December 22, 2013","true","161.1"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

There's alot of the UI where that shows, such as ending turns in multiplayer games, ending your turn completely and being unable to act.\n\nUnit diversity could be a touch better as well in early game.\n\nThat all aside, the game is deep...shockingly deep. There is a whole lot to fiddle with, and experiment here, from varying techs, planet and star system setups, even setting up migrations of population from one star system to another. Somewhere in the 50th turn I realized I was completely hooked, and my fledling 9 world empire (this is TINY compared to the total number of stars available, even in a "medium" sized map.) was just now barley starting to come out of the red and into the black.\n\nThe sheer distance between stars, also makes you feel the sheer vastness of your empire, even when you have 9 inhabited systems (you end up with far far far more) it takes a very long time to get to your new planets. In early game, when your colonizable planets are far flung, you are gambling. it's inevitable really. Do you go so far out that reinforcements will be a LONG time in coming? Or do you take the risk for higher inhabited worlds to come up quicker, and be self sufficient before another empire decides to take them?\n\nThere is depth in a great many facets of the game on initial impression, and the sheer scale involved is daunting. Highly recommend, especially as this game is more often than not onsale, 50 to 75 percent off.","January 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have alot of games ... and few hold my attention long ... i try though lol ... Armada is one that does ... its not got flashy gfx or sound ... the battles suck .... may as well auto resolve them ... the ai ... can be crushingly hard ... its really hard at the start as your libel to be placed 5 stars away from an enemy that smokes you early .... so ... why say its recommended ... maybe im a glutten for punishment ... nah ... do i like pouring over page after page of reports and micromanaging my colony ... well ... in spurts yeah i mean at the start i can do alot of turns but by the time you have 100+ stars on turn 300 or so out of 2000 turns ( you can set it how many you want) it gets rather tedious .... thats not to say i dont enjoy it ... its just work running a galactic empire that stretches across the map .... as its in space the idea of borders goes out the window as each race gobble up prime systems  leave poor ones to be filled in .... the technology systen seems daunting at first as the techs are all way out of reach but as you slowly progress it all comes into focus ....wars are waged with fleets of hundreds of ships ....bio warfare .... planetary invasions ... armies ... orbital lazers .... money concerns on upgrading colonies .... i dont have alot of hours on here but i played it for 100's of hours on gametap ... lots of races .... the diplomacy system not be fooled if your strong they wont attack if they say pay 500$ and we wont attack ... they wont ... dont trade your map info for free .... and dont rush out to big an area at the start and meet the races cause if you do early ... well i havent had good luck .... anyway awesome game especially if micromanaging is your thing .... but i was thinking ... how realistic is a galaxy spanning civ .... information cant travel faster than light ... even if we can do the alcubierre warp drive ( nasa is working on it look it up)  someday ... the vastness of space in our galaxy alone makes the further colonies years and decades and more removed from the central let alone the far side of the galaxy .... so its quite impractical at our current level of physics ... but as my scout ships flit back and forth as the inevitible tide of my colonizers and battle fleets roll steadily onward .... makes you thing of ufo sightings ...ya know ... i mean the scout ships jobs not to come make contact ... or even attack ... just to survey and it could be a long time between the first survey ships skim through the atmosphere til the inevitiable shadow of the dreadnaught ships block out the sun and the cruisers knock out the defensive capabilities before the bio ships come to gas the population .... food for thought .... good game .... yeah i think so","May 28","true","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
