It definately had shining moments, but also many drawbacks.\n\nI really started laughing quite a bit once I got into it, despite just rolling my eyes at the beginning. What really kept me playing was the character interaction, and the overall artstyle of the game. It also looks like Precipice 4 has improved a lot of the "linear" issues, so it's worth playing to lead into that.\n\nIt definately looks like a later SNES title (though not quite Chrono Trigger, or FF6 but close). An interesting battle system compared to 16 bit titles from back in the day...definitely unique.\n\nI like how you can mix and match classes however you want, but having to build MP was annoying for me. Sometimes the battles were interesting and other times redundant, leaving me wanting to just see what happens next in the story instead of fighting.\n\nWay too linear. I actually really like the "Super Mario World" style overworld -one of my favorite things in the game- but the individual areas were way too linear for me. No towns, no townsfolks to chat with, and you can't enter any buildings/rooms within the individual areas. Looking at Bookshelves and drawers give the same text for each one.\n\nMusic is pretty good, but there isn't enough of it, so it becomes repetitive. Certainly no memorable tunes like the classics, other than perhaps the battle theme...but you hear plenty of it..\n\nI enjoyed it a lot and I'm really glad I played it but as far as recommending it to someone else...I'm not sure. For the price, yeah. If 4 continues to be as good as it seems so far, (More of a Cthulu vibe) definately.","December 3, 2013","true","12.2"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","35","37","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/213030/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","Before the release of final fantasy titles on steam, there was Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3. Bearing in mind that this game doesn't relate much to the previous two titles (as they were 3D games and developed by different team), you can easily go head first into this game without playing the others which is nice. The music is alright at setting the mood of the game. The dialogue and story is funny at times and quite unique.\n\nThe gameplay is like final fantasy 3 and 4. You start a few roles (i.e classes) for each character, but you unlock and can switch between more roles later in the game as your character levels up. The combat is similar to the 'Active Time Battle' system in final fantasy IV. Each character (including enemies) will have to wait until their portrait on the top screen passes a line before they are able to make a move. This may be seen as a good thing as you have some time to plan out moves for your characters, however the combat may seem slow to some (especially those who haven't played previous 2D final fantasy titles). There are a limited of monsters in each area and they don't respawn after you defeat them, but you can see them so you won't be walking into a trap. There is also a colliseum where you can easily grind to level up quicker if you wish. There are also some stores laying around which some decent items and equipment at decent to rediculously expensive prices.\n\nBesides the normal campaign, there is also a prequel campaign that doesn't really offer much to the story, but contains  more challenging monsters.\n\nIf you are looking for a cheap final fantasy-like game or never played any of them before you should try this game out. However, if you don't like turn base combat (like previous final fantasy games) you should stay away.\n\n","November 12, 2014","true","13.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"

Combining the creative power of Penny Arcade with Zeboyd's love for old-school role-playing games creates a package of hilarious weirdness and nostalgic vibrations (with a couple hints of modernity) that feels neither derivative nor stale. The turn-based combat has a perfectly applied dose of additional strategy, which can bring even a high-leveled party of characters to their doom if their actions are dictated without thought. To compliment this, the story, dialogue, items, and enemies all carry the ridiculous, eloquent, occasionally poetic writing of Jerry "Tycho" Holkins as well as art inspired by Mike "Gabe" Krahulik. All of these elements together make On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 a funny, bizarre quest that any fan of early RPGs is sure to enjoy.","August 6, 2013","true","21.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Gone is the ability to make your own character; you'll be playing the PA guys the whole game.  Also gone are the 3D polygon graphics and animation, replaced with SNES-esque sprites and tiles.  This would be a big step back in some ways, but fortunately, the combat makes up for that.   It's got some ideas borrowed from other games (like Grandia and FFT A2), and some new ones.  The classes are also pretty interesting, and offer some good combinations.  Fights are less plentiful than some games, but still relatively common, and the enemies are tough, so they can take a while.\nI was annoyed by the fact that, if you stick with the same classes the whole game, you won't wind up with all of them capped out.  To explain further, you start out with no class equipped and quickly gain your first set, then later get another set and the ability to equip a second.  There will still  be leftovers, however, and unequipped ones earn less exp than selected ones.  Add in 2 more factors: the number of fights (and thus exp) in the game is limited (monsters don't respawn), and there's a bonus  dungeon that can only be unlocked by maxing out all the classes.  You can see how this would be frustrating, to finish the game and be stuck with no way to get into the bonus area.  Now, there is an arena where you can fight stuff, but I'm not sure if they give much exp.  Might try this later on.","July 7, 2014","true","12.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032109396/recommended/213030/","76561198032109396","Reduce_to_ash","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032109396/","68 products in account","This game was an enjoyable throwback to 16bit turn based RPGs, but with a twist. They improved the combat system by adding some complexity without making it overly complicated. Since the core of all these turned based RPGs is mostly how well and fulfilling the combat is, the majority of this review will go over that section in detail to give you a greater understanding of how the game plays. I broke down the review in bold sections so you can read what is most important or what is most interesting to you in order of importance.\n\nAt the end of this page there will be a Pro's Con's and overview which would be the closest thing I have to a "TLDR"\n\nTHE GUI (Graphic User Interface)\n\nWhen you get into a battle in this game, you will see a very familar layout, the graphic user interface or (GUI) will probably remind you of a plethora of similar older turn based titles like the final fantasy series, chrono trigger, or the breathe  of fire series. You'll see fight or attack, item and Defend. However this is where the similarities end and some of the polishing of these older combat system begins. The menus themselves are fairly easy to navigate and use, nothing new to see here but nothing bad either.\n\nThe GUI also has one new feature which is really nice, which is a bar on the top of the screen with the portraits of each of your characters and the enemies on a visible time line which shows you who or what enemy is likely to be next in turn. I say likely because in this game there is a "speed" stat and interrupt mechanic attribute which can be manipulated to increase or decrease the likelihood of who's next to perform an action. Speed is exactly as it sounds, a flat given rate at how quickly your next turn comes. Once their portrait goes from the right side of the screen to the end of the bar on the left they start somewhere back on the right, distance moved on the bar per action or round spent is based on your speed stat.\n\nHovwering over an enemy unit will tell you the current hp of the unit, and how many elemental weaknesses it has, but not which ones. Its your job to explore and find them your self! It will also usually include some kind of humorous description of the unit, generally relevant or commenting on its aesthetics.\n\nOther cool features are the skin changes, at any time outside of battle you may change your skin from "furry" "gender swapped" "undead" or "normal". I remember one battle actually had a condition of increasing the power of all female characters during it, but it wasn't an issue and this feature really is just there for your visual enjoyment.\n\nOne more thing of important note: This game has a range of 4 preset difficulties which can be changed at any time (outside of combat/dialogue), should the game not be challenging you enough or too much. It defaults on normal.\n\nTHE INTERRUPT FEATURE\n\nYou can slow targets, stop them, or increase your own speed, but the best feature is the interrupt feature. The interrupt feature allows you  to push back the time it takes of a current foes next turn. When you use an ability that has this feature you will see their portrait be pushed back. This effect generally is on a diminishing return so you can't "lock down" an opponent from ever being able to preform an action, but you certainly can hinder it, and many interrupt abilities later still deal damage, or have other bonuses like not costing MP! Usually every 2nd interrupt wont hit as hard as the previous. So interrupt 1 will give you a good knock back, 2 maybe not so much, but 3 will be powerful again and the pattern continues.\n\nCUSTOMIZING YOUR CHARACTERS\n\nThis game has the traditional armor, weapon and accessorie slot, but the real customization begins with class pins.\nEach character has its own unique abilities, and later on you get up to 14 (1 from an optional boss) "pins" which provide new abilities, passive abilities, and bonus to certain stats and pretty much work much like Espers or Materia for you final fantasy fans.\n\nThere are no restrictions on what character can wear what pin, so you can have quite a few different combinations. The equipped pins gain experience along with the character's core abilities as well, and unlike other older games the unequipped pins will still gain experience but not as quickly as the ones being used. However, each character will inevitably be able to wear 2 pins, so that only leaves 5 pins not at use at any given point in time.  So this lets you balance and combined 3 classes abilities on one character, his own, and the two pins you equip on to them. So any character can fit the role you decide to give to it.\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT COMBAT MECHANICS\n\nThe most important feature in the combat here is that, you  can drag out a boss or any battle until you win but.... it gets much harder.. Ever so often the power of the NPCS get stronger, the longer the battle goes the more damage the abilties and attacks of the NPC's do. So only using one character to deal damage, while healing all the incoming damage is rarely an effective strategy. When you hover an enemy unit you'll see something like XXX% power, every interval they gain 10% more power. The longer you go... well... they start to hit harder and hurt more...\n\nCertain battles even have conditions where certain types of damage or stats are increased (which affects everyone in most cases, you and your enemy). Most of the time these bonuses can be used in your advantage. Other times they add in a new element to the fight to over come and conquer.\n\nMAGIC POINTS AND NON EQUIPMENT ITEMS REVISITED AND REDONE\n\nEssentially every turn you get 1 MP or Magic point and you get a variety of abilities to use, but like any ability it has a cost, some are free, some have greater effect on the first turn, others cost more, and/or have other conditions or bonus effects. However there are items and abilites later in the game that allow you to gain MP faster, such as stealing it from your other allies, or energite, an item that can only be used so many times per battle thatr grants X MP.\nNow to items, Items in this game are consumables that you can upgrade and have a limited number of charges per battle. Every battle they reset to full.\n\nThere are 6 different items to use in the game and they can be upgraded in two different ways, their effect (how powerful) and charges (how many uses).\n\n\nOVERIEW: 8/10\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\nThe tone of this review may sound to some overtly positive but this game isn't without its flaws so we will start with Con's first. There aren't too many though I am happy to say.\n\nCONS:\n\nCertain abilities or ability combos can become overwhelmingly powerful which cause you to stop using previous abilities or fall into routines.\n\nThe game is rather linear, and besides 2 optional bosses, and the Arena, there is little room to "Grind" or gain additional experience or $$$ to farm items, upgrades, and accessories.\n\nThe plot line of the game is a bit hazy if you haven't played the two previous installments. Some of the events and dialogue can leave you feeling questioning your self, If I were to have played the two previous games would I have a much greater understanding of what the hell these people are talking about and who they are?\n\nPROS:\n\nInnovative combat system that holds true to turn based combat while adding in new features to keep it as fresh as possible\n\nLots of character customization and combinations in terms of classes.\n\nDespite the potential plot confusion the game's dialogue has made me chuckle, laugh or bust a gut on many occassions and was still enjoyable regardless of any confusion.\n","January 13, 2014","true","16.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I can't tell you too much about the story, as I don't want to spoil the game. Also, I can't fill you in on the backstory because... I haven't played the first two games. The reason I started on this game, and the fourth, is because they were in a pack and I had played the previous two games the new developers had done before getting asked to do these, which were Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World. That's where my perspective is coming from, so keep it in mind. Basically, you're a company that investigates supernatural happenings, and supernatural things happen. So... you investigate them. That's really all I can tell you without getting into potential spoiler territory.\n\nYou can explore specific locations on a world map with well defined places to go. Inside these places, you can search for treasure, battles, and main plot points for going there. While there is some interesting story and dialogue, the battles are the meat and potatoes of the game. The battles are nice because they are not random. Instead, they are represented by monsters clearly visible on the map. You battle in a turn based fashion, however there's a meter on the top of the screen. This determines the order the combatants will attack. It will be initially set by speed stats and certain passives, but it can also be changed by using slows, stuns, and interruptions. A combatant can also move up their position on the command line by defending, although this will not allow them to attack on that turn. So why bother? Well, to reduce major damage from a major attack, or possibly to help utilize another interesting mechanic. In this game, you don't have a pool of MP to work with. Instead, you start battles with zero MP and gain 1 MP per turn. So if you want to build it up, you can use items, use certain abilities to boost it, or simply do something that does not require MP. This forces you to manage your health and position on the timeline much more carefully, rather than having magic users spam abilities right from the get go.\n\nSo what gives you your abilities? Well, each character starts with their own class. The classes dictate what abilities, passive or active, these characters have. This will affect how you use them. Beyond this, as the game goes on you will receive badges, each with their own additional classes. You get to add one, and eventually two, to each party memeber. This gives them a total of three classes, and many possibilities on how you can build them. However, badges can only be on one person at a time, so you can't use the same class on every character at once. All of the badges and characters level up as you win battles, although the ones you actively use will level up faster. Also, you can further customize your characters with equipment as well.\n\nThis game is full of conveniences, such as the aforementioned blanket leveling and visible battles. Whenever you finish a battle, all characters are revived and restored. If you lose a battle, you get to try it again. You can save or change badges at any point. Convenient traveling through an easy world map, with shops in fixed positions and a training area to grind if needed. The game does a lot to try and ease the burdens of RPGs while still being an RPG.\n\nHowever, I found a few things a bit disappointing. One is that there are too many classes leveling up constantly. It seems that after every battle, at least one if not multiple classes gain levels and often new abilities, which is a lot to look at and manage. You'll be constantly checking your new abilities to see what they do and who they will be good for, depending on how you're trying to build characters. Plus, the fighting system is somewhat complex for newcomers, which detracts from the game's convenience factor a bit. Also, while the game tries to teach you one thing at a time to gradually get you familiar with the gameplay (which I like), it feels like once you finally understand how to fight and manage your badges and equipment and strategize, the game is basically done. It also ends on a cliffhanger story-wise. So, this whole game essentially feels like it is a buildup for the sequel, both in story and basic gameplay ideas. Although the sequel (which I will review once I finish) is rather different in some aspects. I guess I just felt like the game was getting me ready for the real adventure to start, and then it abruptly ended.\n\nOverall, it's still a good game. Fun for people new to RPGs and looking for good value games. The characters and story have enough charm to carry some of the weight. Plus all the conveniences, well paced learning curve, and constant upgrades to manage, make for an entertaining experience throughout. I guess it's good that the game left me wanting more rather than being sick of it, and the extra mode recommended after you finish the main game gives it some more for you to play and satisfy your cravings. However, I'd say that if you're looking at this game, which is only 5 dollars alone, you might as well just pay the 8 bucks and get the two pack because you'll be well prepared to take on the fourth game after this. I got them both on sale for a dollar which was well worth the price. Judging this game on its own, I'd give Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 a solid 6 out of 10 for being an engaging RPG experience without the common headaches that befall so many other RPGs.","March 23, 2015","true","13.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","2"

I truly am. The previous Penny Arcade games, in their 3D environment, semi-free-roaming capabilties, witty dialogue, character customization, and comic book-styled cutscenes were excellent, but this one...\nI just can't bring myself to keep playing. It's become a 2D RPG-stylized game, and though it started out pretty alright, the required battling, which for the most part, is every enemy you see on screen, really started to bore the living fecal matter out of me. It was just too much. Between every fight, you regain all your stats fully, so there's really no urgency of healing, which could be taken as a blessing, but...I don't know...I felt less imersed in this game, less dedicated to the characters and outcome. Sure, the dialogue is witty, for the most part, but given the lackluster gameplay and visuals...it just wasn't fun. I would've rather just read a comic book with the same style and written dialogue without the non-stop RPG fights chewing up my time and killing me with boredom.\nI'm genuinely sorry for not enjoying it more.

Not sure what it did differently to make me like it more than in other games but it's sparked a wider interest in this genre for me so thanks Zeboyd.\n\nA fun little addition was that you could gender swap the characters or turn them into furry or undead versions. As a woman who just enjoys playing female characters (just cause I relate to females more naturally), I really liked the gender swap option.

On the rain-slick; Precipice of Darkness 3!!!\nThis particulary game doesn't exactly remind you of the previous ones duo to the graphics being all 16-bit ish - not that it makes it less awesome - but just a clearly change; though it still has the humour and some of the elements of the first two parts. You will experience a lot of combat with a ton of different skills that levels up + you get more skills the higher level your classes get. The names, the conversations are just purely epic! Go play it, you won't regret it!\nI enjoyed the first two, and definitely the third part aswell. And I can already say that..

It was fine for the first two games, but not much has changed or evolved and it's starting to feel stale. The characters haven't grown much - if at all - and the plot is just moving forward one foot at a time on its predetermined path.\n\nSo if you liked the first two games it's probably worth it to continue, but play them first.","March 6, 2015","true","14.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Never managed to finish the game whatsoever. You don't have to play them to know the general story of the game. Just open the wikipedia page and read the summary.\nA bit of warning though if you are playing this game after playing the 1st two games you might be dissapointed.\n\nThis third game is fundamentally different than the the first 2 mainly because of the devs are different now done by Zeboyd.\nAs for me i like Zeboyd's version better, because i play this game after playing Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World. So i know what kind of "style" i was getting into.\n\nPros:\n-Enemies are on fixed locations. So you don't have to worry about tedious random encounters ala classic rpgs.\n-Characters fully healed and items regenerate after battles. Making the game much more simpler.\n-MPs are not carried over to the next battles. Every characters start with fixed MP. So you don't have to worry about MP management anymore.\n-Hilarious jokes. A bit different (classy) than Zeboyd's style because it's written by Penny Arcade's creator.\n-Unique job system. Dinomancer anyone?\n-Cool snes graphics. Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy 6.\n\nCons:\n-Very short. About 8 hours or so.\n-Too simple and too easy. You only need to find classes that works for you and stick with them to the end. Rendering the customizations offered in the game mute.\nYou should play the game on Insane difficulty.\n-Music are forgettable and pretty dull.\n-Too linear. There is no exploration like in other Zeboyd games.\n-Jokes takes a bit to getting used to.

You control 20's-style detective versions of Tycho and Gabe as they solve the latest paranormal mystery.\n\nEntries 1 and 2 in this series were made by a different developer, and from what I've played of Episode 1, I think that this episode is a much better starting place... it's a lot more fun. Zeboyd Games specializes in making classic RPG combat fun again, and this game features another amazing battle system. It's a classic formula that's not only nostalgic to those who have played early Final Fantasy games, but the strategy is a lot deeper. The battles get very repetitive once you've figured out your strategy, though.\n\nThe graphics are really well-done, though the sprites are borrowed heavily from FF6. The music is pretty nice, though I would've like a longer battle theme. Though the humor is very strong in this game, the story's a little weak. There's not much actual plot... it's just very drawn out.\n\nIf you like classic RPGs, get this game, along with every other Zeboyd Games title. This game's humor is also a great reason to pick this up. If you never cared much for turn-based RPGs in general, then this one probably won't convince you. If this is your type of game, the price is definitely right... there's a lot of content here for $5.","July 30, 2013","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The writing is the same as it was (perhaps even better), but if you're not a fan of Jerry Holkins' style, this game probably won't change that. As a fan of these types of RPGs in my youth, this game brought a lot of nostalgia to the table, and I enjoyed it for that alone.

However the games uniqueness and quirkyness quickly gets tiresome; after reading way too much text that ultimatley says nothing and fighting way too many unnecessary battles that are way too easy the game is boring.\n\nThe pacing is also very bad with the game giving you too many jobs at once with some being very overpowered and others being totally useless. Nice graphics and unnecessary words doesn't make for a good game.\n\nIt's not a bad game by any means but if it's not up your alley then you will quickly get bored of the overuse of superfulous words and overly intelligent themes. I don't think the series spans four games because the games are good but instead they did it so they can try and sell it as good.","November 1, 2015","false","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you love PA and love 16 bit turn based RPGs, you will love this game. It takes liberally from the early Final Fantasy series - always a good thing - particularly the many jobs of FF5 though with a comedy twist. My friends can tell you that I've whined about and mourned for this game for a long time, since it's a new developer (some guy) with a new engine (just freaking RPG Maker) instead of the actual developer that made the first two in the series. In that regard, the 3rd and not-yet-released 4th entries can't help but feel like a disastrous fall from grace. Gone are the 2D and 3D animations whose goal was to capture PA perfectly, replaced by two-frame walks and weak-to-no spell animations. Now as RPG Maker games go, it is a great game.","September 5, 2012","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've bought extra copies of it just to give out to strangers. Yes, it's that good. And I still occasionally buy copies just to support the devs. The game is hilarious, though if you're into modern humor perhaps you might want to pass. There aren't any ♥♥♥♥♥ jokes here, mainly subtle sarcasm and observational humor. If you read PA comics this is a must buy, if not, you can still fully enjoy the humor and story of the game. The combat is classic JRPG style which may or may not appeal to you, I personally love it. After a recent update of 'sorts' which added costumes, I decided I had to rewrite this just to emphasis how fantastic this game is and how it's a must buy for anyone who likes this type of game. The game costs 5 dollers and goes on sale occasionally with over 10 hours of content and much much replayability. I can't begin to describe how great the devs are. I would feel terrible for giving this anything less than a 10/10. There's something for everyone.","July 28, 2012","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Monster fights are in specific locations that you need to go through but once you beat a monster at a location that's it. There are no random encounters and the only benefit to fighting is to gain strength for the next fight and because you have to fight. There are maybe 6-8 fights you can avoid only because the path branches and you only have to fight on path A or path B. On easy you almost don't need to try, but if you want to punish yourself then go ahead and crank up the difficulty level.

Apparently 2 still exist.\n\nThis is a great edition to this series. Though a bit different in terms of style. It is a very straight forward turn base game. The premise fo a 16-bit game compared to the original was a bit confusing, but in the end the new format and style was very enjoyable and easy to get through. As you battle mimes, crabpeople, paintings, ghosts, and a whole bunch of weird (medieval times and star trek esque). You make your way through the world with the thought of stopping Dr. Blood. The story gets more in depth and leaves you with an ending craving you to want to find out what happens next (well I guess a good thing I own Ep IV then). Instead of simply leveling up your stats this game kind of has a human type trainer-esque to it. You level up abilities. Range from magic to necromancer to even turning into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Tyranosaurus Rex. It's a very interesting twist that can lead you to creating a large number of different character set ups.\n\nThroughout this game, one question stayed on my mind. what happened to my character. Where is he, why am I know longer in the party as we quest to stop the evil that first was seen on Desperation St. The short story between Ep 2 and Ep 3. Shows it all, and leaves you with a wtf moment at the end. I played through it as me (well me in a big bag) fighting my way under the sewers and periphery under my once beautiful home. The once quest to find a home I guess sovled at the end though sad as it may be.\n\nI highly recommend this game (most people have it thanks to Penny Arcades free Ep 3 giveaway). I also do highly recommend the series in general. Though you dont really need to play Ep 1 and 2 to get the plot in this one. It's nice to know my reference to the "You" Character Though disappointing it is "You" don't return for the main story of episode 3.\n\nHere's my go through of the story in between ep 2 and 3 if interested - http://www.twitch.tv/punasaurusrex/c/2736518\n\n\n","August 11, 2013","true","12.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I wouldn't reccomend, and definitely wouldn't reccomend if you were a fan of the first two games and decided to pick up the third.

I like Zeboyd's idea of adding new features to the retro RPG model to make it interesting, but no ammount of innovation can possibly remove the mind-numbing tedium of those old games, and no ammount of nostalgia can make them fun. The game took me about ten hours, and that is more than double the ammount of time I'm willing to spend on such a repetitive combat system. Further, while the earlier games were funny throughout, and had amusing plot points revealed about the world of new Arcadia, this one  was only good for the occasional chuckle, and none of the plot was more interesting than stringing your characters along a series of drawn-out dungeons. Seriously, what has happened to Penny Arcade?","November 27, 2013","false","14.5"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/recommended/213030/","aejira","aejira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/","537 products in account","Summary: The game is an obvious throwback to the RPGs of the 16-bit era, with elements that are uniquely set to the "Penny Arcade" universe. The nostalgic appeal loses its' charm very quickly, with an intentionally incoherent storyline and script [which may appeal to fans of the series], extremely repetitive and subpar combat system, and limited exploration. However, similar to how I feel about Farcry 3: Blood Dragon, the game is very short and the main story plus bonus prelude can be completed in 6 hours without much effort. There is some replayability with the different classes available, but I personally cannot see myself replaying the main storyline since it offers little reward or enough of a altered playthrough. The game has some merit and can be a great casual play over the course of a weekend, but I would not recommend it and give it a 2/5.\n\nAlthough this is the third installment in the Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, the approach is completely different in comparison to the previous games. Changing from a 3-D to sprite-based 2-D world is the most  apparent change, but there are a couple additional elements to the game. Timing attacks, button combinations, and overkills have changed in favor of classes, interrupts, and magic. Classes in the game allow for different strategies in combating the enemy and will offer the greatest amount of customization. They range from the Scholar, which utilizes various magic spells, to the Brute which favors more physical-based attacks. By the game's end you will have the ability to equip 3 classes at the same time and can various class mixtures that favor a specific play-style.  Want to build the ultimate melee hero? You can try to mash the Brute, Hobo, and Masochist classes to maximize your strength and plus up on physical attacks. Now, due to the way that MP is accrued in the game, this has some serious limitations. MP is earned throughout a battle, for each turn a character will gain one point of MP. This means that more or less 90% of your battles will follow the same pattern and will make the game extremely repetitive. For me, I had Gabe go into an attack stance, Tycho cast an Apocalypt, Jim cast a Skeleton, and Moira interrupt a monster. Could I have changed it up? Sure! But why would I purposefully choose an option that would have been less effective in those 90% of the battles I fought? I strongly believe that if the game had more of a traditional battle system, similar to the SNES Final Fantasies then it would have made the fighting system more enjoyable.\n\nOne element of the game that I thought was a positive was the use of interrupts in the game. In a sense the game is turn-based, but as you can probably see on screenshots, there is a WAIT-COMMAND-ACT phase. Once a character reaches the COMMAND point, you decide on your action and wait until the character reaches ACT for it to execute. Now some of the classes have certain abilities that will give you the ability to interrupt the enemy. For this to be effective, you have to time your character's interrupt to occur when the enemy is between the COMMAND and ACT points. If successful you can drive back the enemy's bar all the way back to the WAIT phase. This will become critical mid and late game because the more you can interrupt and slow down the enemy, the weaker the enemy will be in the long run. As the battle progresses, each turn of the enemy will yield typically a 10% increase to its' attack. This can be interpretted in two ways: either end the battle fast or prevent the enemy from acting. Certain characters, like Moira, can be class mixed to maximize her ability to interrupt the enemy and give time to the rest of the party to get a few additional actions at the beginning of the battle.\n\nAs with the previous installments, the world is rather small and the vast amount of exploration you will do in the game is limited to a a dozen dungeons. Battles are not randomnized but the types of enemy you fight will be varied and figuring out what their strengths and weaknesses can add some strategy. So the game has a set amount of battles, with pre-set monsters in each battle, and you will fight each battle at full strength [the party regenerates both items and HP after each battle]. If it isn't apparent yet, the game is linear, and each playthrough will be roughly the same as your previous playthroughs. There are only 5 playable characters in the game, of which only 4 will be useable mid to late game. As odd as it sounds, even though there are four characters, there is an extremely limited amount of character development in the game. I know of the loose associations for these characters, but there's nothing beyond that, nothing that really makes me change my opinion or gain an interest in any of the characters. Jim is a floating skull in a jar, he doesn't talk...we learn nothing new about him. Moira  was Tycho's ex-wife, we know something happened between them, but nothing is really pounded out, no flashbacks or intimate moments discussed. There may be some external source material available, but it is still the game's responsibility to draw the gamer into the world and develop a connection with the characters.\n\nHitting on the storyline and script, I know that there are fans out there that just love the humor and nonsensical conversations in the game, but as I played on it felt like it detracted from the game. The awkward, completely random, and  unnecessarily ornate dialogue just gave me even less to care about, the storyline is so muddled and incoherent that I found myself more confused and uncaring about the trials and tribulations of the party. I'm not asking for a 16-bit Game of Thrones, but what I would like is a storyline that makes sense...that has a purpose, an objective that is easily understood and draws me closer to the characters and plot rather than detract from it.\n\nSo in conclusion the game is mediocre at best. It has its' moments, both good and sometimes really bad, but the game has some serious flaws that limits your enjoyment. Buy it if it's very cheap, buy if you were a fan of the earlier games, but do not buy it if you're expecting to relive the glory days of the 16-bit era. The nostalgia runs out so fast, even with the Dragon Quest world and the Super Mario World-esque overworld, and when it runs out you'll realize that the game doesn't have any legitimate merits to stand on. 2/5","January 11, 2014","false","7.9"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowPounder/recommended/213030/","SnowPounder","Peridactyl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowPounder/","298 products in account","Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is a fantastic RPG and I highly recommend it to any and all RPG fans. It is well made and fixes many problems that I feel other rpgs do. Personally, it is one of the few rpgs that I love solely based on the battles and mechanics alone. It has 3 components that makes this game truly fantastic.\n\nThe battles are all constructed so that it is never too hard or too easy. There are no random encounters in this game so you can never be too underpowered to fight an enemy or too overpowered to just easily bypass an enemy. Because of this, every battle forces you to carefully choose your attacks. It's never advisable to just spam the attack button unless you want to die. Also, the lack of random encounters also makes choosing your difficulty actually effect your game. The battle themselves have a sort of timer that determines when a character attacks. the slower the enemy, the longer it takes them to attack. This makes it clear when an enemy is about to attack and when you need to anticipate it.\nThe game also has a certain mana system that makes fighting enemies a little more strategic. You can choose to spend points to do a special move or do a normal attack to gain more points to do a stronger attack, but that could leave yourself vulnerable.\n\nThe class system in the game is well made. Any character can be any class simply by giving them an item. You're never forced to use the same 4 classes every game. The classes them themselves aren't just the generic classes you typically see (like warrior, mage and healer). Each class is very different and creative. Not only that but every class is a viable option. Any combination of classes will be able to beat the game. Just choose what you like best. And because you can easily switch any characters class, you can easily find a class you like.\n\nAnother thing that makes the classes unique is that every class has their own special twist. Some focus on defense and protecting other team members. Some focus on battle stances that change attack effects. Some slows the attacks of enemies. They are very different and yet all work very well against enemies. Replaying this game with different classes is pretty rad.\n\nThis is probably my favorite rpg of all time. Most rpgs I love are due to their story, setting, and or atmosphere. I love Earthbound and I think Pokemon is pretty good too, but I love Earthbound for it's story, setting ad humor and I like Pokemon because i'm able to train and build a unique team. I love Penny Arcade 3 almost solely on it's mechanics and battle system (I do enjoy the story as well). If you love rpgs, seriously, do yourself a favor and buy this game. Especially since it's only 5 dollars cheap.","December 26, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you honestly enjoy random encounters? Level grinding for hours? Having to save your best items for fights that may not happen? Zeboyd has you covered. Every battle in R-S 3 starts you out with full health and every item you have bought/collected at your disposal. At the end of the battle you get all of that back. You also get 1MP per turn (magic costing up to 9MP) which you can use freely without fear of having to save it for another battle. This creates actually enjoyable gameplay where every battle is a different experience (enemies are already put in groups at pre-set points in every map) that requires tactical planning prior and mid battle.\n\nI loved the last two R-S games for being like the Mother/Earthbound games as delightully quirky and fun urban RPGs. R-S 3 manages to continue this trend while being double the length of the last two games (for the better!) and will ALWAYS surprise you. On top of that, you don't actually need to have any knowledge of the former games. Because of that, I actually recommend this game more than the games before it.\n\nIf you love RPGs you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's cheap, it's fun, and if you ♥♥♥♥♥ about it being too easy, play it on Insane and eat your level grinding heart out (level grinding is optional on easier difficulties!).","March 19, 2013","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Battle Time is used but you have to think ahead as you decide the move a few 'seconds' in advance, meaning an enemy can attack in between deciding and acting which puts a spin on the BT system and makes it a challenge, you can't tank it either as the enemy slowly gains power.\n\nThis is a good game but it comes with a warning... the difference between Penny Arcade 2 and 3 is chalk and cheese; I feel that it has lost its charm by becoming a pixelated TBS with active time.  Its continuing the story but it isn't a Penny Arcade game.

A lot of the fluff found in longer RPG's was streamlined. I found most of these simplifications to be beneficial to my enjoyment for a quick game to play during my breaks. It was very linear, moving from one location straight on to the next, with only the occasional branch off the main path leading to treasure chests holding better equipment. You can see all monsters on the map, but for the most part you can't avoid them.\n\nUnlike the previous games in the series, this game really tries to be a throwback to classic SNES era RPG's (with a few modern touches to clean it up). I really enjoyed the art style, which is similar to that in Final Fantasy VI, including the "super-deformed" characters.\n\nIn combat, I rarely found myself spamming the "Fight" command, but instead found myself using many useful skills of the various classes. In an interesting twist, you start with zero magic points and gain a single magic point each turn (or from special abilities). It felt a bit like the Default action from Bravely Default, where I might perform some weaker actions for a few turns to save up magic points for a stronger attack on a future turn. Another twist is that all HP is restored and status effect cured after each battle, which eliminated the wasted time spent healing after each fight. It never really felt like this made the game too easy; in fact, it seemed that each battle was more difficult as a result.\n\nI found a nice combination of classes that I liked to use. This is what I ended up with for most of the game:\nGabe - Brute, Tube Samurai, Masochist\nTycho - Scholar, Crabomancer, Gardenar\nJim - Necromaster, Elemenstor, Dinosorcerer\nMoira - Gumshoe, Cordwainer, Apocalypt\n\nWhile the game occasionally made me chuckle, the overarching story seemed like it was taking things a bit too seriously. It seemed to clash a bit in my mind with the odd sense of humor. Maybe it's because I never played the previous two games in the series. In any case, I always made sure to read the monster descriptions as I found many of them to be hilarious.\n\nAfter completing the main game, I moved on to the Prelude "DLC". While each character only had one class at a time, I liked that the skills were switched up a bit from the main game.

Just as a back story , since it confused me as well, Hot Head Games made the first two in this series and Zeboyd made the last two. After Precipice of Darkness 2 Hot Head Games devoted their time to the game Deathspank (awesome game series btw) and let Precipice go to Zeboyd (why? i'm not sure) but on to the review. This game retains much of what made the first 2 entries great. Same story same adult humor, it truely feels like it is continuing the story line albeit outside of the normal graphic style. This version no longer has the 3-D ish  style it now harkens back to the earlier Final Fantasy 8 bit era. The character you have been involved with in the first two episodes is gone and they some what explain this briefly.\n\nThis game definately is worth the buy but you should play the first two to understand it completely. My only real problem with this game was the fact of constantly being reminded that this is only a shadow of its first two itininerations. Had the series started like this there wouldn't be any problems but to me it is like playing the Assassins Creed Series and then in the new version it has you playing the game like Civilization. While it may still be a good game I would keep thinking how much I miss the old Assassins Creed.","December 29, 2013","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

During the first half of the game you don't really find very many items to equip. Later on in the game you end up with so much money that you can easily buy the best items in the store, which kind of makes you over-powered... because of this the item system feels somewhat useless (and many of the items in the game are.) I enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World (made by the same people) much more due to the dialogue and characters, but this game was easier to play, and the level design was less infuriating.

Health regenerates every battle, meaning that more emphasis is put on figuring out how to survive each encounter over throwing you a bunch of generic, easily dispatched enemies to deplete your resources.

However, as the game goes on, battles become engrossing, especially with the dozen-odd classes you can mix and match (Hobo anyone?); the chiptune music is surprisingly catchy; and the highly-sarcasic comments and randomness will keep you wanting more.

So it is review time.\nStory- Some time has passed since the events of RSPoD 2 when Gabe and Tycho go on another mission to find out who Mr. Blood really is and what he is up to. But things are not what they seem to be as it seems everyone has a secret to hide. Just when you think you know someone. This story is quite darker than the previous two games with a fair amount of death, betrayals and lies. My main problem with the story, though, was where was my character from the first two games. After all he's  been through, he seems to dissapear from the game for good. Well, he (or she) is not forgotten as there is a little side game prolouge that explains his dissapearance, humorous but desturbing, that is all I will say on that. A-\nGraphics- Well, Zeboyd games now takes the wheel for creating this game and so they took a completly different direction graphically. Remeber the old Final Fantasy games for the SNES? That is the style to expect for the remaining games. The retro style looks nice and well defined but may not be for everyone. C\nSound- There is no voice acting this time around and the retro sound effects are lifted straght from FF6 but the music is actually an improvement from the previous 2 games with a surprizingly rich score. B\nGameplay- This game plays just like an FF game from SNES days and that is not a bad thing. The controls are easy to get used to and are even better with controller options available (XBOX controller preferred). The dungeons are fun to explore and the battles are a blast from the past. There is even a class system for additional strategy in battle though the fights are relativly easy, it's fun to expirament with different combinations of classes. The down side is that the world map is very restrictive as you follow a strict path from point to point, making the game seem kinda restrictive. B+\nOverall- Due to the poor sales of the first two games, the project was almost canceled, but was picked up by a different company to finish. As such, you cannot transfer saved games. Though they manage to find creative ways around this issue, it still feels dissapointing that you cannot continue as your created character and that really bugged me throughout. But it still was a fun game and much improved from its predecessors. Recommended. B-","January 17, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So it is review time.\nStory- Some time has passed since the events of RSPoD 2 when Gabe and Tycho go on another mission to find out who Mr. Blood really is and what he is up to. But things are not what they seem to be as it seems everyone has a secret to hide. Just when you think you know someone. This story is quite darker than the previous two games with a fair amount of death, betrayals and lies. My main problem with the story, though, was where was my character from the first two games. After all he's  been through, he seems to dissapear from the game for good. Well, he (or she) is not forgotten as there is a little side game prolouge that explains his dissapearance, humorous but desturbing, that is all I will say on that. A-\nGraphics- Well, Zeboyd games now takes the wheel for creating this game and so they took a completly different direction graphically. Remeber the old Final Fantasy games for the SNES? That is the style to expect for the remaining games. The retro style looks nice and well defined but may not be for everyone. C\nSound- There is no voice acting this time around and the retro sound effects are lifted straght from FF6 but the music is actually an improvement from the previous 2 games with a surprizingly rich score. B\nGameplay- This game plays just like an FF game from SNES days and that is not a bad thing. The controls are easy to get used to and are even better with controller options available (XBOX controller preferred). The dungeons are fun to explore and the battles are a blast from the past. There is even a class system for additional strategy in battle though the fights are relativly easy, it's fun to expirament with different combinations of classes. The down side is that the world map is very restrictive as you follow a strict path from point to point, making the game seem kinda restrictive. B+\nOverall- Due to the poor sales of the first two games, the project was almost canceled, but was picked up by a different company to finish. As such, you cannot transfer saved games. Though they manage to find creative ways around this issue, it still feels dissapointing that you cannot continue as your created character and that really bugged me throughout. But it still was a fun game and much improved from its predecessors. Recommended. B-","January 17, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat system is more tactic based which makes combat alot less tedious. Instead of just using the same moved over and over, or mashing attack, you really need to think about your actions, and how to get the edge on your enemy. If you try to fight every battle the same way you'll probably end up losing a lot. It's also forgiving. If you fail a battle you just have to try it over until you succeed. I was happy to see the fun dialogue and interesting characters didn't suffer from the large switch in game styles.

Basically the same combat system as Zeboyd's earlier games, crossed with Penny Arcade humor.

Other people have complained that it's linear, especially in the "overworld", and that is certainly true, but I'm not really bothered by it. For me, the biggest problem with PA3 is that PA4 is so much worse.  This game ends on a cliffhanger and finding out how the story ends requires you to play the sequel ... and unfortunately, it turns out that PA4 is somewhere between mediocre and terrible.  If you like a good old-school hack-and-slash RPG and aren't too hung up on understanding the things happening in the story, you could definitely play PA3 by itself and have a lot of fun.","January 22, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luck as in who the enemy will randomly target, and with what attack. If they do it in the "wrong" order -which are most of them-, it's game over; but if they attack you in the exact right way, you'll survive. True, after a while you can compensate for this by having your own "level up" area, but that just turns it back into grinding mobs for EXP...\n\nThis is particularly annoying considering that the whole point of the first two games' combat system was born out of a desire to make every fight count; non-repeatable, non-random, and the attacking and defending skills being more important than the stats. They'd fixed something that Jerry/Tycho in particular thought of as "broken", and then this game comes and reverts it back to broken again.\n\nThe retro graphics doesn't really work either. Much of the charm of the previous two games was that it really captured the aesthetical Penny Arcade essence, especially with the cut-scenes being done in comic book format.\n\nIn the end, I played through this game -and the next- mainly because the first two games had presented a really gripping story that I wanted to see done to its finish. And that's pretty much the only reason I can think of to buy episode three and four of this series. Otherwise, steer clear.","March 31, 2015","false","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the writing, aesthetics, linearity, and Penny Arcade might turn some people off, the Grandia-esque battle system is well-crafted, the character classes are uniquely designed and encourage synergy, and the vast majority of battles are challenging on the hardest difficulty setting, requiring both proper configuration of party members beforehand and careful consideration of formation and agility within them. The way most of the genre's trappings like encounters, experience gains, items, and resource-management are streamlined keeps the game's pace going quite smoothly as well. 15 hours well-spent, especially at such a low price.","July 14, 2013","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is based on rotation, the faster your character, the more often his or her turn.  MP is reset to zero and replenishes at a rate of one per round.  Health regenerates every battle, meaning that more emphasis is put on figuring out how to survive each encounter over throwing you a bunch of generic, easily dispatched enemies to deplete your resources.

Luck as in who the enemy will randomly target, and with what attack. If they do it in the "wrong" order -which are most of them-, it's game over; but if they attack you in the exact right way, you'll survive. True, after a while you can compensate for this by having your own "level up" area, but that just turns it back into grinding mobs for EXP...\n\nThis is particularly annoying considering that the whole point of the first two games' combat system was born out of a desire to make every fight count; non-repeatable, non-random, and the attacking and defending skills being more important than the stats. They'd fixed something that Jerry/Tycho in particular thought of as "broken", and then this game comes and reverts it back to broken again.\n\nThe retro graphics doesn't really work either. Much of the charm of the previous two games was that it really captured the aesthetical Penny Arcade essence, especially with the cut-scenes being done in comic book format.\n\nIn the end, I played through this game -and the next- mainly because the first two games had presented a really gripping story that I wanted to see done to its finish. And that's pretty much the only reason I can think of to buy episode three and four of this series. Otherwise, steer clear.","March 31, 2015","false","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music is more catchy.  You lose the descriptors on every minor object in the world, but those held no meaningful value so not really a loss.  Environments are just placeholders for progression... but that was still true in the previous game too.  At least there's no backtracking.  Game takes a more serious tone here so if the comedy that overlaid everything in the first two games was a detriment to you like it was to me, then you will appreciate this change.\n\nGame mechanics become more traditional of RPGs, so no un-fun QTEs every fight this time around.  There's a meaningful amount of customization and planning, compared to the first game where every upgrade was limited and linear.  Its just more fun all around.\n\nIts just more fun.

Just as a back story , since it confused me as well, Hot Head Games made the first two in this series and Zeboyd made the last two. After Precipice of Darkness 2 Hot Head Games devoted their time to the game Deathspank (awesome game series btw) and let Precipice go to Zeboyd (why? i'm not sure) but on to the review. This game retains much of what made the first 2 entries great. Same story same adult humor, it truely feels like it is continuing the story line albeit outside of the normal graphic style. This version no longer has the 3-D ish  style it now harkens back to the earlier Final Fantasy 8 bit era. The character you have been involved with in the first two episodes is gone and they some what explain this briefly.\n\nThis game definately is worth the buy but you should play the first two to understand it completely. My only real problem with this game was the fact of constantly being reminded that this is only a shadow of its first two itininerations. Had the series started like this there wouldn't be any problems but to me it is like playing the Assassins Creed Series and then in the new version it has you playing the game like Civilization.

For me it was more or less to see what the game offers in gameplay perspective and I'm happy to say that it doesn't let you down.

This is the only game out of the Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness series I have played, and I am glad, cause it sucks. The last time I played this game was in like 2013 (I am writing this in May of 2015), and all I remember was thinking "ooh goo gaga" (I was only an infant back then). Needless to say, my infant mind could not make any sense of why giant enemy crabs were attacking my party on the boardwalk. Although this game makes no sense whatsoever and I hate this genre of games as a whole, the pretty shapes and colors were actually quite pleasing to the mind of a newborn child. Although my real parents died in a ballooning accident, I played this game long enough to teach myself the basics of the English language.\n\nIn summary, if you are an infant or a prospective immigrant moving to a primarily English-speaking country, then this game is for you.","May 14, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
