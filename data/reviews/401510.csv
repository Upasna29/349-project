You are a crab, trying to get your son back who has been stolen by an octopus who is designing traps for you.\n\nLavapools has 3 gamemodes on several levels:\n1. Procedural\nThe most common gamemode. You collect gems from gem spawn points, and as you get more gems the world gets more hazardous. At 25 gems the door opens to end your progress and save your score, but you can keep collecting gems. When you die, you drop about half of your gems in one little pile and can pick them back up when you respawn (with 0 gems, of course). The hazard level/rank/music also resets when you die. The levels in this gamemode are the smallest compared to other gamemodes.\n2. Maze\nGems are already spawned in and do not respawn at special spawn points. There are several banks located around the map, and walking over one stores any gems you may have collected so you don't lose them if you die, and it also becomes your spawn. The banks are not separate, they all add to one total count displayed on the bank. If you die but have collected gems, the gems return to their original positions and no gem pile is dropped. 25 gems opens the door, but there are more located around the map - you may want to try and collect all of them for an extra challenge.\n3. Vertical\nThere are no gems in this gamemode. Instead, the screen scrolls and a lava wall is at the bottom of the screen. You have to keep up with the moving level, at the same time dodging hazards. There are several paths to take in this level, which will lead you to a checkpoint mark. If you die, you respawn either at the beginning or at the checkpoint, if you have passed it. After the checkpoint, there is another stretch until the end of the level.\n\nThere is a bug - the octopus talks about finding 25 gems at the beginning of the vertical levels, even though no gems are involved.\n\nSome of the many hazards you will encounter:\n-Lava pools (of course)\n-Sawblades moving across fixed paths, and sometimes switching directions\n-damn bats moving in fixed directions that you have to observe on your own\n-spinning arms in different arrangements: 180 degrees, 90 degrees, T formation, cross formation, and half-arm (center on end of arm instead of middle)\n-spike-shooters aimed at one or multiple directions along the x and y axes\n-lava wall in vertical levels\nMaybe I am missing some hazards, but I got the most common ones\n\nGood luck!","May 4","true","10.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","11","18","4","1"

Think a bit of Dark Souls, but with krabs, mixed in with the good old 2d/snes nostalgia to add for aesthitics. Overall, always a blast to play. Oh yeah, did i mention there's bats?","May 9","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Fun theme and characters with good presentation and controls. While the levels are similar and the only mechanic being dodge bats, blades and spinning... extended... arrow thingys, there is 3 different level types to keep it interesting. The scaling difficutly is very well balanced ending on a super challenging boss battle.\n\nYou have to collect 25 green... things to unlock the portal to the next level. As you collect more, the level gets harder by spawning more bats, spinning blades, etc. When you die, you start over but half of your collection from the previous level spawns as a tombstone in a random location on the map. This adds a ton of great risk/reward strategy to the game.\n\nVery cool game worth the price of addmission. GG!","May 7","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I loved the music and especially that it is dynamic. It is a neat little feature that was very well implemented. The only thing I did not like that much were the UI's of the game, which could have been more intuitive but then again, a UI is not the main function of a game! For the price, I would totally recommend this game!\n\nDisclaimer: The developer gave me a key to test his game and produce a video about it on my channel iKliklaLP. Though this is technically a product placement, my point of video was not biased by that!","May 12","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
