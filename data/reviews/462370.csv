Some of the sprite boundaries are larger than the sprite. Meaning that some edges of objects/characters don't ever touch because the invisible bounding box around the 2D image is larger than the image itself. This can make the object collisions look poor.\n\n2. The music is well intended, but ot quite fitting for as casual as this game is. The music is a little too upbeat in my opinion.\n\n3. At first I did not realise that a bomb explosion could travel through objects like metal and stone. And although it doesn't make scientifical sense, it seems to be necessary to clear a level sometimes in this game. I found out on accident.\n\n4. The user interface is a little too flat; with oversized buttons that dont feel right to me. And the game isn't designed for full screen so it looks a little grainy.\n\n5. There are enough bombs to clear a level without any challenge (or at least in the first few levels). The only real challenge is to get a perfect score. Example: there are 2 bombs and 2 enemies. Sure there must be a way to get them both in 1 explosion, but its no challenge at all to use 1 bomb on each of them and pass the level.\n\n6. I blasted through the first set of levels on the map in a few minutes. Way to fast.\n\n7. Some levels start out saying something like "don't let him fall" while there is a character sitting on a platform. Basically you need to place bombs to explode the enemies without tipping over the platform with the good guy on it. Trouble is, before I can do anything, the structure falls over and 'he' falls with it.\n\nOverall, I was hoping to get something as cool as World of Goo or Angry Birds, and this isn't even close. I feel like this is a bad port that was meant for an iPad.\nOnly reason I give it a 5 is because it is playable and it does deliver the minimum expectations.\n\nBut if you love to support indie games and you are all out of casual games like this to play, then give it a shot.","April 22","false","0.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

"A physics puzzler designed for mobile/touchscreen devices!" He touched his hand to his bosom as if overcome by emotion and softly purred, "I have never seen such a thing in my life". Suddenly, he perked up, his eyes going wide with surprise. "What's this!? The UI is cumbersome and the hitboxes are really poor, thus rendering the levels clunky to play and clunky to restart as well!?" His eyes rolled back in his head and his hand went back to his bosom: "I... I think I'm in love..."","May 17","false","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
