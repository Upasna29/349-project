Theres constant popups from the start that say your workers are hungry, your workers need a pee which means they wont do anything until you build toilets/kitchen etc i mean you cant even start the damn game.\n\nAnother time i couldnt even place furniture in a room, no placement, workers dont work, no sound, objects dont show on map at times, i didnt even get to trying a film out but nevermind.\n\nSeriously tho, this game is not ready to be even early access, in its current state i wouldnt even give this game away, let alone pay the current price, and its a shame, i just hope things change sooner rather than later otherwise i can see this being a game that never leaves early access.\n\nSo im sorry but really cant recommend it to anyone.\n\nI will attempt this game again in the future and hopefully give it a much better review than now, good luck!","November 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"
