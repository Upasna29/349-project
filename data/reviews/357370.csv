It is more like a choose your own adventure book. Theres very little interaction, your character is just drawn as part of the background. The writing is fan-fiction quality, maybe its better in german. The "gameplay" consists of clicking on 3-5 items in each room, which are drawn as part of the background, and choosing whether to look at them (which gives a 1 line description of the object), pick them up (or move to another room), or use an item. Theres no options menu, which is annoying because the game is insanely loud and only runs in fullscreen borderless, and there are no resolution options either.\n\nThe only well thought out feature is the "cutscenes", the way theyre presented in comic book style is kind of neat. Too bad theres no game around those.\n\nI wish i could return this, because I dont support the idea of interactive stories being sold as games. It would have taken bare minimum effort to turn this into an actual point and click adventure with the drag-and-drop game making tools available today.","April 3, 2015","false","16.7"," 84 of 107 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","84","107","0","4"

This game needs serious polishing, there are no voiceovers  and I had to mute all sound due to the annoying background music.  The description sounds great but ingame there isn't enough story setup.  It is a short game, with about 20mins of me trying to figure out the last action sequence, which in fact ended up being simple.\n\nThe cartoon comic strip type gameplay, clicking on it to forward story I like, if the story was better fleshed out and written, more to do and a lot longer I would recommend it but even at $2.99 I didn't think it was worth it, and the first chapter of reversion is free point and click adventure and far better than this game.  Premise is there and I do like the story, with a bit of tweaking and a LOT more gameplay and length maybe the next chapters will be worth it.\n\nedit - Gameplay was just over an hour, cards have been added since hence the length.","April 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","43","54","0","2"

Even though there's a distinct lack of sound design, and the gameplay could do be more interactive, the story doesn't fail to be interesting even when it falls into commonlike tropes. I think it's a nice start, hopefully we'll get to see more of it, it's hard to judge something through a pilot. Personally I'd like to see some improvements on the interface (minor stuff) and I believe voice acting could help a lot.\n\nIn terms of characters, I have to say that besides the broody protagonist, the female leads, Sarah and C, are very likeable and well written. C is my favorite, even though I can't quite place it. All and all, a small taste of hopefully more things to come.","May 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/357370/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Jack is a member of the local force, in a world where downtown is equal to a prison, at least, for the upper citizens, not aware of the reality. However, one day, his pregnant wife got killed in an explosion and he never recovered from that. Now ousted from the force, he's contacted by the same terrorists that need his help. Is what Jack always believed in really the truth?\n\nReturn NULL is an episodic adventure game in a dystopian world, where those living downtown are oppressed by the authorities, without really a perspective to survive and with the truth being hidden to the upper citizens (though they can be thrown down to what is described as a prison/jail). The story is interesting as we meet Jack before the death of his wife and after he's ousted from the forces because of the depression that followed. While Jack wants revenge, he's convinced that maybe the truth isn't the truth and is now ready to take down the society he once swore to protect. Everything is centered around plans of a bomb, even in the second episode.\n\nHowever, I will only concentrate on the first episode as the second is available as a DLC and I will not spoil it. So, this introduction is interesting as you're leading a depressed yet determined Jack in the streets of this upper part of the city, not realizing of what is really happening down there (Jack himself isn't really sure of what to find, even if he knows the truth about it) or being afraid of the local forces, as people are taken and never seen to return.\n\nThe gameplay is a point-&-click game: you speak with people, you interact with them, you find items, you solve puzzles. There is nothing extraordinary added to Return NULL on that point and it's working perfectly. However, as it's a game with choices to make, you can expect some impact on the story (nothing really major, apart on the dialogues). It's just the way you will behave with people and how you will blame yourself on your wife's death. Besides, you can be met with a gameover as you have some action in the game.\n\nWhat I liked in that game is also the graphics. I loved how the characters are depicted in a comic style. However, there is no real animation in the game. You're just in a static background. Jack isn't moving around, you're just pointing on where to go or where to interact and it's done like that, like in a casual adventure/hidden object games.\n\nI also liked the soundtrack. However, there are no voice acting. You just read the dialogues as in a comic book.\n\nI really liked this first episode though I found it short, even if some parts of it seems long (but it's the time taken to find how to solve some parts). It was a good premise for the story to come and for the price, it's not a waste of money - at least, for the first episode. I'm giving you a warning ahead for episode 2: I don't know what happened but it wasn't as good as this one.\n\nI'm still waiting for episode 3 to make a conclusion for the whole series....","May 11","true","3.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ros1981/recommended/357370/","ros1981","ros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ros1981/","87 products in account","Quick review:\nThis is a low budget but nicely envisaged BEGINNING to a story set in a dystopian future. The art is of a comic book style and reasonably well drawn. There is no animation and no voice acting (I don't find this a big problem) but the plot so far makes me hope that this could turn into an engaging and enjoyable story. The puzzles are traditional point and click style inventory puzzles that are sensible but too easy. You'll get through the chapter in around an hour. I don't feel chapter 1 was worth paying for on its own purely because it is so incredibly short.\n\nMore detail:\nReturn NULL has a few things that are very promising. The writers have created a dystopian future world that is, initially at least, interesting and a main character with some depth and a back story that makes you want to know more. From playing the first episode I really, really hope that this develops into a full blown well written science fiction story.\n\nHowever the first chapter feels more like a taster than a proper first chapter to a game. It's not even as much as some games offer as a free demo. I think comments about the low budget sound and visuals are a little unfair given the cost of the game but if the developers want us to believe that this is a story worth hearing, they should have given us a a bit more detail. This could have been in the form of more characters to interact with,  a few more locations to explore, or a few more puzzles.\n\nI really hope that when the developers get the funds they will make a more substantial chapter 2 but I'm not holding my breath.","May 1, 2015","false","9.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

The backgrounds are quite good and have some form of detail but the characters are non-detailed and that really annoying me from scene1.\n\nSound 7/10\n\nI loved the music background.It fits perfectly with the mood of the game. I hope they can increase only the  quality of some SFX like the soothing or some minor ones but generally its really good.\n\nStory 7/10\n\nReally nice one. They make you understand whats going on from the start but without giving you too much details and also make you get “attached” with the main character for what happens to him.  At some points felt some TV series episode, but i must confess that i had some issues with going to fast at some points with the story.\n\nGameplay 6/10\n\nSimple enough basically. You don’t have to make anything ..difficult… mostly click to progress the story except some few moments that you have shoot so you much lick the bad guy at the right moment before he shoot you back. UI its also simple and nothing to talk about really. Basics but functional. I wish they can implement most interactive parts, like the shooting. Something like defuse a bomb, open key door or something like that. Its too static and you can feel that after some time.\n\nOverall 6/10\n\nFor sure its not the best but NOT the worst game. I enjoy the story and i hope the Part 2 will be as good as this one. With some fixes and implementations this one can be really one of the top of his category.\n","September 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Most of my time here was idling for cards prior to actually playing it several months later.\n\nI think this is one of those games that if it were released in its entirety all at once, it would have better reviews, because many of the negative reviews were on how short it is.  But it was probably a financial reality that they needed some revenue from Episode 1 to help fund development of future episodes.  I don't know that for a fact-- just guessing.\n\nEpisode 2 is out now-- I don't have it yet.  Maybe when all three episodes are out I'll revisit the game, because it does show promise.","January 28","true","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is nice but short.\n\nFirst, it looks good. A comic book kind of style with still images that you interact with to progress with the story. Every screen will clearly show the tone and feel of an area.\n\nThe story is interesting and I was into it. The problem is that the game comes in two parts (more parts are to come, I assume). You can buy the game for $2 and get the first chapter. It then costs $3 for the next part, which really was a downer for me. It is very cheap which is why my verdict is recommened. $5 isn't a big problem but I wish the game was all together.\n\nAnd the game is short. You will be stumped in the puzzle given but don't be fooled by my 2 Hours on record. I only finished the story of Chapter one in 45 Minutes. The rest of the time I idled for cards (I assumed I wouldn't need to).\n\nOverall, a good buy at $2 and if it does go on sale, jump at it. I can't confirm if Episode 2 is the same since I don't own it and I don't feel like I should get it. Doesn't seem right.","December 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It doesn't do anything badly, per se, but there's nothing to recommend it as a game, really.\n\nIt's basically a very limited, linear, plot driven comic book. And a really, really short one.\nWhile the writting isn't all that bad, this is completely unfit for a game. You have no agency at all. There are some dialogue choices, but they don't seem to change anything. It's all an illusion of choice, while you get the same result regardless.\n\nI don't like plot-driven media in general, so your opinion may be very different from mine.\n\nBut here's the thing. This game is a big setup. They try to have some emotional impact in the beginning, but mostly fail, since you have about 2 minutes to make the emotional bond. Too fast and in your face to achieve anything, personally.\nThen, they try to present the world and its dystopian issues, but it barely has any content for it to work. There's no exploration, no talking to interesting characters... everything is placed to move the plot forward. And the plot isn't any good either. It may become good, but it's a 30-40 minutes game, at most. And a big part of that is walking back and forth, so it's not really a good measure.\n\nThe images are static as well. The game is gorgeous. I really like the look of it. But... it would look just as good as a comic book.\nOnly, it would have more pictures...\n\nThe music is alright as well, and sets the mood correctly.\n\nNo interesting puzzles, no interesting characters, no exploration, nothing. There's absolutely nothing that makes this benefit as game. It only hurts it, honestly. Because it creates situations for the player to "interact", i.e. use screwdriver to open something, or use piers to cut wires... They don't add anything to the game, they're simply there, making things clunky.\n\nYeah, not a fan at all. It's not broken or anything, it's pretty solid at what it does. It's just that what it does is not much.","June 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Way too many clicks needed to do anything, way too little interactivity with the world, not very responsive. The writing, the music, and the puzzles are ok at best. The idea behind the game is actually pretty good, there's an interesting world hidden in there somewhere, but so far it's a let down on execution and immersion.\n\nI'll play the next chapter and see if it's getting any better first, but I'm leaning negative.","September 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a beautiful game in appearance and sound, with a comic-like visual style all its own.\n\nYet there was very little in the way of plot or gameplay - and what was there, I can't say I recommend to anyone in particular.\n\nSorry.","April 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

In this game there is a grand total of 13 interactive still screens without any animation whatsoever, 30 clickable/interactive objects, I counted a little more then 100 drawings that are not really terrible but could easily be a lot better. Add to this the fact that the dialogue selection makes no impact on the game itself (you can click anywhere during the dialogue sequences it makes absolutely no difference) and you got yourself a game suffering from lack of content.\n\nThe story is also a mess... I seriously question the maturity of the people who made this game. If the developers are kids then it is a great first step into game development.","February 8","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
