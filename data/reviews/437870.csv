I recommend the game for the reason I was enjoying such things right from the Moonbase Commander (which is quite old now). But - I see some mishaps so far which is why not everyone happy about this project, so - I urge you to think before getting yourself into.\n\nGenerally, there you build some structures, and then build more. And more. Some of them are very basic for survival (giving your colonists energy, water, fresh air and so on). Other will be gathering materials for the further growing, and once you'll have enough - you get more structures to build (like bigger powerplant or even a factory to build stuff from another stuff). That's it! Build - wait to collect some materials - build further. There will be other tasks, like maintenance of your buildings in the unfriendly environment - but those elements are quite crude at moment. In theory, you can build military base, and even fight some foes there... But principally, it's about building and developing, and not raging wars. And that's a good feature! Too many games are theming bloodbaths now and too few - prosperity and well-being of the all humankind.\n\nWhat I liked was the overall atmosphere, which returns us to the romantic novels, like Ray Bradbury used to write. You know, about blooming gardens on the Mars surface...\n\nWhat I didn't liked is the lack of content - but the developer promises to make more. What I didn't like even more is the unfriendly interface. Considering the facts that your buildings wears off quite fast, you need to build new ones and hire maintenance stuff even faster, right? But to build new pods you'll need materials. Which of existing structures produces them - you'll learn only when click all of them. If you'll need more stuff later - again, you should manually find that specific building and make an order of producing. Even on the point, where you'll be managing dozens of materials, you'll be doing the very same basic moves by finding the producer, ordering him to do some work, and controlling all such producers... Jeez, I need "yellow pages" there!\n\nIn the bottom of the hud there are 5 special buttons to Destroy your colony. I'll not be arguing, that they can be of some use... yet I don't need them so often, even if I forget about Bradbury completely. I'd preferred to see on that place some other, much more useful elements, like special buttons for producing all aviable materials from one place!\n\nTo make a final statement, this is a building sandbox simulator, which is not quite good with the building so far... and considering its sandbox nature, not so much fun. Yet... it is still early access, so there is still hope. You know, of the better future. So far, it is just another indie game made by one man, where you need to tune with the developer's logic - like Zigfrak, for example. I'll mark it as 6/10. Certainly not a sleep-taker. Yet it deserves to be on Steam much more than many other scumming junk pieces, which people buying only for cards. As of price, though... Sol 0 is two times cheaper and delivering more fun at moment. Think, people.","April 27","true","14.7"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","1"

This game has some work ahead but for under $15 it seems to have some fun potential. If you like to build bases and handle a lot of resource management this will be another game to add to your library. I would recommend this game to those who like to see games develop from the start and be a part of the development process. The developers have been responsive to comments so looking forward to the future on this one.\n\nHere is my video review if that is more your thing.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhJOaYoKJFE","February 12","true","3.1"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","1"

Baseidea is pretty much the same as in any builder out there. In this one you're colonizing Mars and apparently other planets. Start from scratch, build housing for your people, factories, defenses, luxuries and so on and try to keep all of this together without falling short on funds or get destroyed by disasters.\n\nMusic fits the game perfectly (Reminds me of Hitchhikers guide to galaxy for some reason), and sooths you while the game becomes progressively more and more of mindless micromanagement. I have to compliment the narrators as well on boosting the experience.\n\nPersonally these games are all about replayability and gameplay and thats just what the game has to offer. Starts off with a nice tutorial to help you get started even if you're not familiar with the scene. For future, i hope some more modes of gameplay would be introduced to the game to add extra replayability and hours in the game.\n\nAll in all, i can suggest getting the game for anyone who enjoys citybuilders/micromanagement to the fullest.","February 23","true","2.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/437870/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarth Space Colonies, developed and published by Persona and Pixel Studio, is a Steam Early Access title that fits within the resource management simulation-strategy genre. The ultimate object of the game is to terraform space colonies and to save the human race. The first planet that you have to work your magic on is Mars. You have been selected to create the first self-sustaining colony on the red planet. You must terraform it into a natural, fertile wonderland that is beaming with life. Getting there will not be easy as you’ll have to manage your resources expertly and balance between growth and development and maintaining the stations, buildings and equipment that you already have at your disposal lest you kill off your colony.\n\nI have to suggest that for an early access title the game is already at a very playable level. There are three planned zones but the current game is limited to Mars. There is more than enough content to satisfy your gameplay needs for at least several hours and I’d suggest that there would be a lot of room for replayability. I know that with my first playthrough that I wasn’t necessarily happy with a few things that I did, for example I should have utilized my space much better, and doing things differently would likely have provided me with different outcomes. Most importantly what is there absolutely works. It shows off its potential, ultimately leaving you wanting more but allowing you to have a taste of what is to come. It’s exactly how I would hope an early access title should be.\n\nThe level of micromanagement in this game is something to be praised. I feel that many games within this subgenre fall short in the accessibility of micromanagement. While I know that not everyone is a fan because it can become tedious I can appreciate when a developer puts the work in to find the right balance. I believe that that balance is met extremely well here. Of course, balances can change throughout the development of a game but for now its a major pro.\n\nI quite enjoyed the objective structure of the game. There’s always something new to build and develop towards and there is seemingly many ways of doing that thanks to what appears to be a very diverse marketing system. The research into how many of each structure do you build to amass a colony that suits your needs will leave those who like to build data sheets spellbound for a long time. Do you target experience points rather than finances or vice versa? Is there a way to capitalize on both targets at the same time? What is the quickest and best way to attain your next actual objective? There is room for a ton of strategies that could work. Some will fall short, obviously, but therein lies the beauty of the genre.\n\nThe game is currently priced at $13.99 and is going to be raised as many early access titles are when it is released. If you’re a fan of city and base builders and resource managers then I would highly recommend jumping in now. It’s already what I would consider to be a good game and knowing that more is to come makes me very eager for its retail release.  A wholehearted recommendation.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group and our Curation list get on this http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 19","true","4.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Build the next item... ok.  Need some blocks foor that, but not sure which ones as they are overlaid with a stupid red obscurring blur (because thats always helpful).  When you inevitibly select the wrong blocks, your screwed.  Restart. Try another pair of blocks... ok, I have the blocks, except wait...  that building needs a total of *12* blocks to make the next structure and storage can only hold *10* blocks - becuase math is hard?\n\nOne wrong mouseclick, you have to restart.  Oh but how could you possibly click the wrong thing?  I'm sure there are tooltips and useful contextual information thruout...  NOPE!  There are some crazy horrible voiceovers in the 'Tutorial' that made me choke on vomit a little, and which were no use at all.  Had to resort to Guess & Click!!

I had high hopes for this one. The issue isn't it's early stage in development, it's the glaring lack of design work. The main thrust of the game is producing saleable products to fund your colony's growth. There is no support in the UI for this, however.\n\nEach building is seperate, so you have to click on each building to view its status. Then for each unit of raw materials you want to produce, you have to click once per unit to add it to the production queue. There's no way to say "I want to produce these until I say otherwise"; you just have to click hundreds of times. And if it finishes, then you don't get a notification, so make sure you click more times than you need, or resign yourself to checking back periodically. Then, you have to click each manufacturing building to view its status, and if it's not currently manufacturing, you can tell it to produce one manufactured item. No queue there, so just remember to check each factory periodically to see if it's finished with its one item. Then to sell the items, you go into that building and click once for each item you want to sell. If you want to sell fifty units, that's fifty clicks. If you think all that sounds pretty tedious, you'd be right.\n\nThat the game has reached a playable state with no thought given to how it's going to be played makes me very doubtful that the game will ever fully mature. I'd love to be proven wrong. I am not going to hold my breath, however.","February 14","false","1.0"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","22","34","0","3"

The game itself is similar to Planetbase and Sol 0: Mars Colonization. At first glance Earth Space Colonies looked quite interesting to me since I haven’t really played a management game for quite a while, especially a space one. That said, I was somewhat drawn out due to the graphics because from the screenshots on the Steam Store page, it looked like a game for mobile devices but once I was inside the game, it wasn’t that bad and I grew fond of them after a while.\n\nRight now the point of the game is pretty simple, even though, from what I’ve played I still couldn’t figure out if what I’ve gone through was part of the tutorial or if there was no tutorial at all. What I can say is that you always have atleast one objective given to you by one or more of the game’s characters and that is one of things that interests me most in Earth Space Colonies. The fact that it has characters and a narrative driven story, which I assume is still being worked on. According to the developers, the game will have three different campaigns and I only played one of them.\n\nPros:\nThe game runs pretty smooth, atleast for me. (over 200 FPS ingame with 970/ i5 3.2Ghz)\nNice music, and even though it gets repetitive, I still find myself enjoying it.\nHuge variety of craftable items and resources\nSense of progression, not usually found in this type of games\nCons:Buggy and clunky AI (technicians tend to get stuck on buildings or in thin air)\nThe UI is somewhat confusing and unintuitive at all, it could use a complete overhaul\nThe pace of the game tends to stagnate when you’re waiting for a research to complete or resources to be reproduced\nLack of radar/map which indicates damaged buildings\nOverall thoughts\n\nAfter around four hours of gameplay, I still have mixed feelings about Earth Space Colonies but I can say for sure that the game has the potential to become a very good game. But, right now I feel like it still needs some work, optimizing the AI and polishing the interface, because I can imagine some people would get somewhat confused while playing it at the moment since it can be somewhat unintuitive.\n\nThat said, I do think the game might be worth your time if you’re into space exploration or if you’re just a fan of management games in general with a little bit of micromanagement thrown into the mix . The three different campaigns make the overall game much more interesting Since each one of them focuses on different aspects, “Terraform Mars, defend Ceres, explore Ganymede.” Unlike other games from this genre, in Earth Space Colonies you always have some sort of guidance throughout the game, the objectives. These help you progress not only on game mechanics and unlocking new craftable items and resources but also allow you to progress through the story.\n\nSo, if you like what I mentioned and if the game interests you, I say go for it. It seems the developers are currently working on the pathfinding AI and hopefully, soon enough, all campaigns will be complete.\n\nRating:\n\nI would rate the game “Earth Space Colonies” a 6.5/10\n\nWant more recommendations?

These are really small issue.\nDidn't take too long to complete as the game stands, and will be looking forward to what comes in the future updates.\n\nReally fun for a first release if you like this type of game.","February 15","true","8.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But this game has none of these functions.\n\nEvery game needs to be tested undepend of the release typ.\n\nThe game starts with a tutorial ...WASD to move and hold right to turn the camera seriously? This game needs a tutorial and not a "how to play your first computer game"...\n\nThis game contains a lots of icons in combination with values but they have no descriptions, so you have no clue of the meaning of these icons and values.\n\nFor example the landing pad has a icon with a rocket and the value is 10... what does it mean? Do I require 10 rockets to lunch a rocket? Where can I see my current amount of rockets? I'm out of rockets, where do I get new rockets? I can't do anything because I'm out of money... And I need rockets to receive money... maybe I need money to build rockets, idk?\nNote: Rockets = Money\n\nThese are thing that should be mentioned in a tutorial.\n\nAt this point I just stopped playing...\n\n-Game crash on exit button... As a software dev I can diffently say that this kind of bugs wouldn't exist if the game was tested on other machines from normal players\n-Add Tooltips and descriptions!\n-The UI is overall totally miss designed\n\nDid you heared something about Testing or QA? Yes? It seems that these game was never played by an other person then the programmer.... Testing without players from the outside of the dev process is just waste of time.\n\nNo pause/option menu on ESC - but you have a button in the upper left corner....\nNo multiply savegames... back to the roots... :D\nNo Game Over - Destroyed everything with aliens and I had no ressources left...\nOverlapping Menus\nNo exit/close button for menus\n\nThe Tech level up screen is absolutly annoying!\nAdd stack queues to the item processing... to much micro managment if you have a lots of buildings","February 12","false","1.3"," 26 of 95 people (27%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","27","26","95","4","11"

Maybe it's just me though... Who is buying all this stuff we're selling in the market? I could see maybe selling it to Earth where you came from once you get the landing pad built, which isnt even an option, but there's really no one there on the planet to buy all that stuff. And since producing and selling this stuff is the only way to advance at some points (which isnt really explained in tutorial), why can't we automate manufacturing of goods so we dont have to keep clicking, clicking, clicking, clicking, clicking? There are astronauts and buggys roaming around with no ryhme or reason. Modules do not connect together in any meaningful way to make other modules function (as in PlanetBase). Some of the verbal comments by A.I. assistants do not make sense in the context of what is going on at the time. The details of  how specific resources are needed to enable buildings are not in the tutorial. At some point in tutorial you are just left not knowing what to do next to accomplish what you're asked to do. I will keep my eye on this game for updates. It will be a cool game when more complete and details thought out :)","February 16","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
