Things not to expect,\n- Animated cutscenes\n- UI with decent usability\n- Character models worthy of 2015\n- Character animations worthy of 2015\n- Progressive campaign\n- Character customisation during campaign\n\n\nCutscenes are "animated", but show frozen models, with speech laid on top.\n\n\nUsing the game feels clunky, you will often accidentally stop your hero mid stride because you accidentally clicked twice on the target, when you should have clicked once. Or your hero doesn't move, because you should have clicked twice when you clicked once.\n\n\nIt doesn't seem that there has been a User Experience designer involved in the development of this game, there are too many basic usability issues. Such as that you can't bring up a town screen by clicking on a town. It took me nearly 10 minutes to figure out that you need to double click the little town name on the bottom left to do that. Ridiculous. That's just one example, expect a lot more like that.\n\n\nThe character models and animations certainly look dated, and many look like they are reused directly from Hereoes VI. Most of the time, you'll notice that Heroes VI had much better character models though. Models are small in battles, so you don't see the details (maybe this is for the best, as the details are not that great). The entire game has a washed, grainy feel to it that takes away from the "Heroes feel". Heroes should be lush, with powerful colors, to immerse you into this fantasy world with its multitude of colorful, odd beings. This is not the case. You get sort of the same feel as when opening a spreadsheet or something. The delightfulness is clearly missing. There's a sparse, somewhat empty feeling to it.\n\n\nThe animations are clearly a step down from Heroes VI. For example, the Centurion will bash his shield at the opponent, then stick his spear in it, and only about half a second after BOTH attacks are completed does the target react and make some kind of motion. Not immersive.\n\n\nThe campaign is not progressive. I. e., it doesn't build a story for you to follow, but rather it's just a few short stories that you can play through in any order you want. Personally, I would be fine with this, if everything else had been good.\n\n\nSame with character customisation, you start out with predesigned characters, sometimes at level 0, for other scenarios at level 30, which may annoy some people, but would have been fine if the game was otherwise up to snuff. Of course it isn't.\n\n\nThe good things are: It's a new instalment of Heroes! For people like me, who grew up with it and love it, this is great. The maps have depth to them visually, which is fun. Castles can be in valleys and so on (but the washed out, derelict feeling that I mentioned earlier detracts from this). Skills feel slightly more useful than in the last Heroes. They've taken some time to groom the skill set. On the other hand, it's not the glory that was Heroes V.\n\n\nIf you're fine with all this, then this game might be for you. The truth is however, that Ubisoft again is trying to get away with minimum effort. What I don't get is, do these people take no pride in what they do? Does it feel good to crank out one half-♥♥♥♥♥ effort after another? Is it a matter of competence, do they not have the right people? Is everyone working on the game too junior? Or is it a conscious strategy from the management?\n\n\nDon't they want praise from the fans? Why aren't they creating it with "game of the year" firmly fixed in their minds? I simply don't get how someone could be satisfied with creating something with this level of indifference. That can't be a satisfying way to live your life. If you don't like the series, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, sell it to some studio who DOES love it.\n\nIt comes down to this: those who grow up with this game now, as I grew up with the original series, are NOT going to love it. It is not loved by its developers, and that transmits through to us, loud and clear.","October 4, 2015","false","12.0"," 1,050 of 1,175 people (89%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","89","050","1","56","37"

I still cant give a positive review, because there are just so many aspects ruining the fun, even for hardcore Might & Magic fans.\nFirst and most importantly: the incredible amount of bugs.\nJust to give a few annoying examples:\n- Game crash during start / Random crashes\n- Blackscreen during start (can't even open the taskmanager and close the game anymore)\n- Game crashes while saving causing your savegames (yes, plural) to be corrupt\nAs a result of that you cant even continue the campaign you were playing during the crash.. the only workaround for me so far was to delete every single savegame for the campaign to be even able to start it again (gave up after I tried the same campaign 3 times because of this ♥♥♥♥)\nBy the way: if there is a better workaround, I am really interested :)\n- Campaign objectives are randomly not working some times\n\nBut if you really can live with that major bugs and many more minor ones, there is still the following for you:\n\n- The combat sounds are a disaster. There are just none with high combat speed activated, so you just hear music and nothing else + alot animations have no sounds in general\n- The campaign selection was crappier made than the equivalent in some 20$ games (You hear the voices of the characteres while looking at a picture of the person talking.. proper animations seem to be too expensive for Ubi..)\n- The Uplay DRM stuff is annoying as always, inkluding the usual connection problems for a special amount of fun\n\nPersonally I could live somehow with the last aspects.. but the crashes and mainly the corrupt safe games are absolute no-goes.. it is seriously annoying if several hours of your time were for nothing, just because the game decided to crash again for no reason.\n\nDont make my mistake and buy this game atleast before it really is done, if ever at all.","September 29, 2015","false","47.2"," 806 of 916 people (88%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","88","806","916","28","16"

Stay away.\n\nIt's been said that this game would be the one to restore the old ways of doing things that 3DO and New World Computing had set in place. However, this is just a false promise meant to make you spend money on a cheap product that is glitchy and isn't even fun.\n\nI'll start with the poor AI. It's worse than HOMM 3 AI. Yes you read that correctly, a game from 1999 has better AI than a game from 2015. I played a map on hard difficulty and found no difficulty at all. The AI is so dumb it's laughable. To explain, all of the neutral armies made serious mistakes that didn't even make sense. In battle, enemy melee fighters, for example, make movements that aren't even towards my army. They just made themselves fodder for my archers instead of causing me to take losses. The most annoying AI shortcoming of all, which made combats not challenging to the point of no-fun, was enemy archers defending instead of attacking. When I would move a single melee troop next to them to stop them from shooting the AI would just have the archers defend instead of move or attack to clear their path so they could shoot again. This was on hard difficulty. Don't get me wrong - I want to win but it shouldn't be that easy, especially on hard difficulty. Shouldn't AI maximize my losses on hard difficulty? At least in HOMM 3 that's what would happen. In this game it didn't even do that.\n\nThis game feels cheap too. The opening cinematic is a camera panning over stained glass. No nice animation or anything. The fonts are terrible and did I mention the crappy AI? It's also riddled with glitches; e.g. windows supposed to have text have none, creatures disappearing from the battlefield etc. Shouldn't this stuff been weeded out during the open beta that this game had? It really seems as though Ubisoft is just taking advantage of the dedicated fanbase that the HOMM series has and just churning out whatever crap it can slap the name on to make a quick buck.\n\nIf you can get past the rest of the garbage AI and poor quality that this game has to offer then you'll have to deal with the long winded slow gameplay that makes the rest of the HOMM franchise look as fast paced as Starcraft 2. In older games you could build up your army and move out quickly if you played intelligently. In Homm 7 there is so much trash in the way and reaching your high level creatures is such a pain (because of the town level system) that you get stuck within your zone control slowly amassing an army to move out just to get stopped by more trash outside of your zone. This change in strategy is amplified by the reduced movement speed of heroes compared to older games.\n\nThis game is a disgrace to the HOMM series and I can only hope that my refund request gets accepted. Don't make the same mistake I did, if you want HOMM you'll have to go back to the older games or just be disappointed like me.","September 30, 2015","false","3.7"," 499 of 581 people (86%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","86","499","581","21","12"

In my case, the game uses 100% of the system disk throughput for 10 minutes while loading saved games, and then crashes silently. Across the board, for various reasons, stability seems to be a major problem with the game client.\n\nWhen it does run without loading a game, it uses ~6GB of RAM and shows mediocre performance, which is hard to understand for a game with such unremarkable technical and graphical ambition. Any 4X game, including any from Ubi's own wonderful Anno franchise, provides a much larger and more complex world at a much lower RAM footprint and with better overall performance.\n\nAs much as I hate bringing price into any discussion about games, it should be said that $50 for a game that clearly has serious technical faults (even without considering the vast number of problems preventing people from even playing it) is unreasonable, especially when you consider how high the bar has been set for indie developers in the $15 range. Issues like this would break the reputation of any lesser franchise almost immediately. I do regret purchasing this game, and I'm afraid I can't say much positive about the developers until the stability issues are resolved.","October 1, 2015","false","9.1"," 303 of 349 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","303","349","6","1"

However, the more I have played this game, the more I have come to the conclusion that I cannot in good faith recommend this game in its current state.\n\nI am a longtime fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. I was introduced to the franchise with HOMM2 and instantly hooked. Heroes 3 holds a dear place in my memory. It was the game a friend and I would sneak away from school during lunch in order to play hotseat. I didn't play much 4 but 5 and 6 were both extensively played. The hours total on my steam account do not count the much larger part of hours I spent on the titles before linking them to my steam account.\n\nAnyways, I held off purchasing this game for a long time because of the negative recommendations I read on forums and from a friend who played during the betas. I ended up purchasing it the night before the release because I am a huge fan of the series and felt like it could scratch an itch for me.\n\nI started with the Stronghold campaign and played through without any issues. I was one of the few who had no CTD or game ending bugs. I read the negativity on the forums and just attributed it to bad luck or people with an axe to grind. I then proceeded to play the Haven campaign with a couple of game ending bugs and CTDs. I gave up and then tried to Dungeon campaign ( my favorite faction) and couldn't get through a first level of the campaign. I struggled through the Sylvan campaign but eventually was able to beat it. Now, on the Necro campaign, I think I'm calling it quits until this game is fixed. Corrupted saves means that I cannot load up a mission I have been working on and complete it. The game has no way for me to restart a mission when all the saves are corrupted so I cannot do anything to restart a mission unless I restart a campaign entirely. I'm sorry, I'm on mission 4 of necro, I don't want to restart the entire campaign. Through all these issues, the game has slowly worn away my patience and enthusiasm so that now, I don't want to spend a huge amount of time loading only to have a CTD while loading a save.\n\nLook, the game has great bones. Once this game is polished, it has the potential to be one of the top entires within the series. I think the developers took the game in a good direction BUT the game has far too many bugs in it to be released.  When the game is working, I love it. When it isn't, I am incredibly frustrated. I want to play a heroes game and this game is not in the condition that I can reliably play the game.\n\nI plan to change this recommendation once these bugs have been ironed out. I like the communication the developers have had on this forum and others about their plans. Free content to be released, fixing issues and balancing things show that the developers are interested in the long term health of this game. However, the game is currently in a state that will frustrate many, even among the most hardcore of HOMM fans.\n\nCheck back in on this game in a month or two. I hope that it will be in a much better state and you will be happy with the purchase. I do not regret my purchase because I see the potential the game has but I cannot recommend someone to purchase a game and then wait a month or two until it is in a more playable format. As of now, the developers have some work to do in order to fix the amount of good will they have burnt through.","October 22, 2015","false","114.3"," 269 of 308 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","269","308","4","11"

Game reliably desyncs after approximately 3 - 10 turns or 'days', and crashes to menu the following turn.\n\nThis is exactly the same issue that presented when we tried to play throughout the beta. That this game is now fully released with identical bugs is a disgrace for a high tier publisher. The same issues presenting is unacceptable, particularly given the cash grab that was "pre-order for beta access". One would have hoped the beta would serve to raise issues, that would be addressed prior to full release. Unfortunately not.\n\nMeanwhile, this game is being retailed as a multiplayer game.

I've spent over 50 hours since release, and every map has some game breaking bugs.\n\n1. some quests are just straight up bugged out that you have to restart the map, and redo everything again for the quest to work. I spent more than a day to finish a map, and the last quest bugs out. It just pisses me off.\n\n2. The sound is the worst thing in this game. Sometimes, there is no sound during combat, like at all, but there's sounds during normal play. Sound doesn't match with actions on faster combat speed.\n\n3. Crashes. This game crashes a lot on my system. When some textures have a hard time to load/render, it just crashes. Some other times, when I fight that particular packs of monsters on the map, it just crashes, everytime. If I skip just that one pack, it works fine. I can play a much more demanding game like Witcher 3 on highest settings, and my pc handles just fine. I'm not even sure why this game crashes so much.\n\n4. Spells don't cast at locations you point to. Especially firewall, firewall sometimes wouldn't place on the tiles that you want to assign, but it would cast a row in front/behind it. It's just stupid.\n\n5. Effects texts on units/monster just fly all over the screen.\n\nThere are many more bugs, that I can't possibly list them here.\n\nOn to game design,\n\nQuests/stories are boring, so boring that I don't even spend time listenning to them. This game quests are worst than HoMM VI. The quest logs don't even explain how to get something done, or have no direction. The pinpoints on the map sometimes work, sometimes don't. I would pick HoMM VI over this game anyday.\n\n\nUnits are plain, and boring. Range units from all factions either shoot through a row of monsters, or throw something in the sky and do area damage. There are not much design or imagination went into designing these units. The champion units are just stronger, and have more health, with a bunch of passive effects that no one cares to read, and rarely visibly matters during combat.\n\nThere is no balance between might and magic. I just pick magic everytime. I can finish the whole map with 1 stack of monsters, and maxed out firewall if I play correctly or I can just use Prime magic and summon stack after stack after stack of elemental units, and the AI just attack those summoned monsters. Most spells are just useless, I just use those very high damge spells, and it would get me through everything.\n\nTheir cutscenes are not even animated, well I'm sorry, the candles are animated, but the characters are still images, and if you look at some models, the design is just ridiculous. The necromancer girl eyes are not even lined up. etc. etc.\n\nI can sit here, and tell you how bad this game is all day, but I'm sure you're already convinced not to buy this game, not right now.\n\nTD;DR:\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. JUST DON'T. There are so many bugs, crashes, balance issues. Story is boring, cutscenes are not animated, units are plain simple, not unique. There is little nothing new/intuitive about this new installment, they took what was already there, and made it worse.\n\nI would get this game if it was less than $20 bucks in the future.","October 4, 2015","false","55.8"," 287 of 340 people (84%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","84","287","340","14","4"

This is what they achieved in Heroes VII..\n\nI have been playing Heroes for over a decade and hoping to see this one for a while.. And they even add Solmyr again which is my favorite hero off all times. By the introduction video starts the disappointment starts also..\nFrom the first second you can feel how far from the quality this product is.. I really think even Heroes III have a more interesting introduction cinematic. And the menu.. The colors they choose, the fonts.. everthing looks so cheap.\n\nFor a while I tried not to see all of this. Just start a single player map, of course choosing my favourite hero Solmyr. They even managed to ruin that. In map screen you see a floating genie but in hero page there is a man figure with two legs..\n\nEverything looks so sloppy that it looks like they give 0 importance to the details..\n\nI must say they did create some very interesting game mechanics which can add a variety of possibilities to the game. But some they serve it in such a poor condition that you must force yourself to play it... The game looks way behind of Heroes VI and even Heroes V.\n\nIf you are not totally committed to this series never ever think of buying this.. And even if you are committed still think twice before buying it..\n\n\n----UPDATE------\n***My views after 15 hours of game play***\n\nI continued to play for the strategy elements that I mentioned before.. The result is more disappointment.. The game really is as bad as it looks and feels like.. The AI ie totally broken. I played custom maps so I don't now how it works in campaigns because maybe it can be more scriptted so you may have more fun but for custom maps..It just doesn't work. The AI is so lazy and arrogant(!).. It passes by many free resources on the map. Doesn't even bother to collect any of them. It never try to invest itself. Most of the times it dully wonders with lots of heroes (w/o armies)  around the map.\n\nThis looks bad but the battles are even worse.. Sometimes units just go left, and next turn, they go right while continuing to tkae ranged damge from my army?! Or big units (2x2) try to go narrow passages (1 square).. Then wait there or turn back to try later... In the battle map with river, whcih has only one way to pass trough to other side, a bridge, enemy units try to go left corner where there is a river.. Then they return back to the bridge.. But  again they wanted to give a second try to river.. If you have one or two rangeg units or some solid spells it is really makes no sens to fight.\n\nThe AI offers no challange at all..\n\nSo pardon me because I don't want to be rude but this game is an insult to its fans more than a tribute!.. After Heroes III, nearly all games tried to do something different.. In the end, they also mostly failed but at least they tried. This one try to gather all of their good parts and ruined them all for good..

As soon as you start the campaign, you are greeted with a static 3d screen of this guy's council. Are you serious? It's 2015, and this isn't an indie game, it's not priced like one, and you can't even animate this? At first i thought this was turned off as a performance option, but no. And there are plenty other similar "cinematics". Seriously ubisoft if you're gonna use static 3d scenes, DONT, use drawn scenes or something else instead.\n\nThe gameplay is actually allright, but it doesn't do anything new or different from the rest of the series, for multiplayer or single player vs AI you might as well just play 3, 5 or wathever your favorite installment of this series was, and the campaign is pretty lackluster compared to 6. I suppose two things i liked here was the hero progression in general with that skill wheel, and having more factions at release like Academy which is an old favorite of mine.\n\nThe game as a whole doesn't look that good. I wasn't expecting ultra-photorealistic graphics in my heroes game, but this doesn't look any better than 6 concerning texture quality and effects. Also re-used assets ♥♥♥♥ me off.\nThe units are the things that look the best in this game, and yet many heroes 6 versions still look better.\n\nConsidering heroes 6 was such a mess at release and was eventually patched into a decent game, i'm hoping this one can improve but right now it just isn't worth it at full price.","October 2, 2015","false","30.4"," 252 of 302 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","252","302","7","6"

I doubt Ubi will learn a lesson from it as they have a history of doing this but one can hope.  The amount of money this game could have made overall as a finished product released with positive reviews will now sadly never be realized.\n\nAs for the game, this game is the best Heroes iteration since Heroes IV, though as any review it is up to opinion and discussion I will try to keep it on topic and based on things at least measurable.\n\nGraphics are very good, I did not like Heroes V or VI graphics, V graphics very much reminded me of early WoW graphics they were bulky, fat, and simplistic with tons of bright colors.  VI trimmed it up a bit, but VII is full rendered fantasy with great designs from an artist with some great concepts, the green dragons in this one look amazing for example (they look like they themselves were grown out of the forest) and many other creature designs are very well rendered, if still a bit bulky and ill defined for my tastes it is miles past V or VI.  IV had actual scans of 3d models as sprites, and III any way you look at it, the graphics are severely dated.   But I am happy with the graphics on this game, the maps are also amazing, and the towns are beautifully rendered.  In V you had 3d animated town screens with dramatic sweeping cameras but I find I don't miss them, and prefer the solid functional and pretty town screens they implemented in every other hereos game, and so I can say with confidence this is my favorite when it comes to graphics in all areas but two: 1) the animations for some creatures are a bit odd on fast combat speed, and while somewhat to be expected even on slow speeds animation starts and stops can be awkward.  2) some of running animation of hero mounts also seem off on the map.  Overall, 9/10 for graphics, I'd give more if it had the animations better sync'd with the game.\n\nSound is very good in this game, I love all the sounds in combat, and the music is stunning and very pleasant and there is different music for every town screen.  This seems lovingly done and very much puts me into the mood to play and does a ton for the atmosphere of the game.  10/10\n\nGameplay is addicting, I just had my brother and neighbor over and we played from 6pm at night to 4am in the morning hotseating and visiting.  We intently helped each other play even though we are techinically against each other, and it was a walk down memory lane and enjoyable in new exciting ways that pleased us very much.  Since the gameplay bugs were fixed we had no reservations about digging in and very much loved it.  It is all it promises to be a heroes game playing homage to its roots, and past, and community wishes.  The skill system is somewhat revamped, but I consider it an improvement, the same things that were always there, are there but it shows you everything and what you're getting into making better strategy.  Many of the broken mechanics and annoying things any long time heroes fan would know about were addressed.  Some juicy examples: you can quick combat and if you don't like the results you can play manually.  This makes for quicker turns and less gambling on how good the AI will play on your behalf (which you couldn't expect much from the AI in any heroes game but we'll get to that more in the next section).  Town building screens are very informative now, right clicking on most things lets the window stay open so you can examine abilities, AI turns are quick (heroes V had they had longer turns than players often times AI was still bad),  there is a compendium of information for heroes and units, medusas no longer guarantee kill things, minotaurs no longer have a chance to block all damage, there's more slots for artifacts, having the wrong school of magic doesn't totally screw your hero on a map when a powerful spell is found because you can still learn it just not as strong as if you were in that school... the list really goes on and on and I'm still finding large improvements on gameplay.  There are a few minor things I'd like to see changed but I can't bring myself to even mention them at the moment.  10/10 for gameplay this is the direction heroes should go.\n\nThe AI is pretty bad in any heroes game, but it is really missing decision making in this one and hopefully that is patched in.  I still prefer it to the release date heroes V AI because it would take about 5 minutes every time you ended turn and it was still stupid.  This is lightning quick, as IV, and III were and has yet to achieve their intelligence but on a normal game at least they can still come into your territory with a sizable army and make a fun diversion.  When it gets to the meat of strategy though, no Heroes AI was ever good and there's lots of ways you can beat them having bigger armies than you but that is part of the formula for heroes imo.  You kill bigger stronger foes by being smarter,it's a strategy game after all.  Sometimes it will fail in this though and you are up against an AI that managed to kill itself.  That happened in V though and even IV a few times, but it was something to laugh at rather than get mad, usually with friends.  There is definite room for improvement of the AI however.  AI is 5/10. If they start picking up ALL resources they come across and don't always buy a ton of heroes could boost that a lot.  This would let them build bigger armies and punish players who take too long to explore or wait longer in base to build up bigger armies to use weaker strategy/take less losses in capturing objectives and collecting treasure.\n\nThe worst part of this game in my opinion is the comments on the official website, while some were deserved for releasing a game that should've stayed in beta testing for 7 months, the level of irrational hatred there and raw negativity makes me ashamed to associate myself as a fan.  I really liked the idea of the shadow council, and silencing negative opinions can seem draconian, but moderation, tone and a code of conduct are still very important factors for making a game and atmosphere built on constructive feedback.  I honestly wish they'd just remove comments on their official website as it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth every time I go there.\n\nIn conclusion, the game was released too early and paid a heavy price for it, and will now always live in that shadow.  It is however through patching, now the best heroes iteration since Heroes IV.  It has improved gameplay, great graphics, been based on community desires and feedback, great music and sound, and fixed and improved upon many broken mechanics and annoyances from past iterations learning from the past in a good way and taking the Heroes franchise in a direction that I very much want to see, on the strong stipulation that Ubisoft will stop releasing games that aren't finished ruining not only their company reputation but the games that had a lot of potential to become market breakers.","December 23, 2015","true","43.1"," 217 of 277 people (78%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","78","217","277","13","8"

Still feelin so sad to write a negative rewiev about one of my beloved series. I bought the game just on its release and even people here were sharing negative reviews about game on its first day, i didnt care and honestly i didnt meet with any bugs or crushes unlike the ppl talking about when i started to play the game. For a week it was still ok. Yes game itself lacking many major features (fail cinematics and artwork, inconvenient battle sound etc.) but was still bearable since i mostly look for playability and challange.\nBut after a week, when i am back from another city for a couple of days and wanted to play again but couldnt load my campaign save. Tried to fix it but i couldnt. After 10 mins i even couldnt launch the game. The game i was playin with no crashes for a week was not launching this time. And yes this is terribly annoying.\nIn conclusion my opinions about the game (i stilll feel sad to write those about that masterpiece series)\n\n\nNegatives\n\n- After playing so long, be prepared to have crashes and never be sure that you can load your game from your desired save, cose it may be corrupted already.\n- AI is dumb. Even with a crap army but with a decent hero, you can win against AI easily.\n- Units are unbalanced. It shouldnt be that hard for a pack of elite unit to kill a weakling pack of core unit. But you cant...\n- Artwork is not beatiful as other HOMM series. e.g in HOMM3 remember city artworks, but HOMM7 towns look like a cheap japanese manga cover\n-Some unit artwork is pointless (check upgraded asassin and black (fearie) dragon)\n-Sometimes AI turn takes hellishly long\n- Crappiest cinematics ever\n-Not a great selection of talent trees and might and magic heroes are not designed well according to their speciality. Why would i have 3x spell talent tree but crap might tree on a ranger hero??\n-Artifacts are not alluring like in previous series. I shouldnt be fighting with  zounds of undead in a crypt just to get +2 defence cloak...\n- Outdated graphics in total\n- No random map generator and so few maps in core game\n-Game seems like it is beta and not finished\n\n\nPositives\n\n-Campaign story is very nice\n-Playability and gameplay is good and not boring. Feels like kinda between homm3 and homm5\n- City features like spying/sabotaging etc. are really nice additions.\n- Item sets are also nice addition for gameplay\n- No spells to be abused and mastering on magic heroes is not a piece of cake as on previous series but when mastered it is really powerful\n- Racial talents on heroes are reallly nice. (Righteousness and natures revenge are lovely )\n\n\nI still dont say dont buy this game, buy this game after its fixed, buy it but NOT NOW","October 8, 2015","false","47.7"," 136 of 164 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","136","164","3","1"

Ubisoft strikes again. Having been a staunch fan of the series since Heroes 3 I was full of hope for this game and with Heroes 7 we were promised a return to the glory days of the Might and Magic series by combining the best features from previous games with some exciting new additions. As it turns out that was simply the set up to a joke, the punchline being this game, and I for one could not be less amused.\n\nI won't even comment on the Uplay aspect as thousands already have and their complaints have clearly fallen on deaf (read: uninterested) ears as the platform is still being pushed. I will simply take you through my  Heroes 7 experience.\n\nGiddy with delight at the prospect of playing a new Heroes game full of promise, judging by the pre-release gameplay videos, I purchased the game before release. Not just the game but the deluxe edition. As such there began a waiting period where Heroes 7 sat majestically in my library shining brightly like the bastion of turn based strategy I hoped it would be. If only I had looked a little deeper and seen the carefully woven fabrication or opened my nostrils and smelled the mile thick coating of polish that adorned the turd that was this latest Ubisoft offering. But i digress; the day finally arrived... it was ready to play.\n\nWith a slight tremor of excitement I moved my mouse to the play button and, as a lonely bead of nervous sweat rolled down my temple, with bated breath I pressed it. Little was I to know that was the most fun I'd have. After what seemed like an eternity there began an intro. 'Ok', i thought to myself, 'not too bad, don't judge yet' as the lacklustre video\ncontinued. I arrived at the main menu and was instantly struck by the garish colours and dare i say lazy menu design. But yet again I resisted the urge to give up and pushed on; 'maybe the gameplay will make up for it' I thought to myself.\n\nHaving selected campaign there began a 'video' intro to the campaign. Now the observant among you will be wondering why i have left video in quotes. The campaign intro is in fact a series of static pictures that are pushed across the screen with some clunky, poorly acted dialog playing simultaneously. This all but confirmed in my mind my earlier  suspision of laziness. I then reached a point at which I could select one of several campaigns and lo and behold after choosing one i was treated to some more static images pushed across the screen with further uninspiring commentary. It was at this point I began to take some personal offence at the release of what I was already beginning to suspect was a shoddy, unfinished mess.\n\nAll this could have been forgiven however had the gameplay been of a high standard. To say the gameplay is clunky is to say the heart of the sun is a little warm. In comparison to other games in the series the movement around the campaign map and the combat both felt sluggish and mired.  While the faction town was visually appealing the menu was again  cumbersome and unwieldy and the town was lacking in customisation options. The hero skill wheels were disappointing too and provided dull, minor benefits at best. All in all the gameplay was as poorly implemented and devoid of innovation as all that had come before. After my campaign attempt I tried twice to begin a single player scenario. Both times the game crashed when trying to load the list of available scenarios. I struggle to comprehend how Heroes 7 made it through the testing phase to the point of release in the state it is. The only explanation i can think of is that somehow a build from very early in the development cycle has accidently been released (fingers crossed the mistake will be rectified).\n\nAnd with my foray into the underwhelming gameplay the offence was complete. All that was left was to remove it from my system, scrub my eyes that they might recover from the horror they witnessed and try to move past the extreme regret i felt that day.\n\nIn conclusion: thank you Ubisoft for my 'deluxe' piece of garbage.","September 29, 2015","false","1.8"," 168 of 218 people (77%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","77","168","218","37","2"

From the bugs that occur, it feels closer to a alpha -> beta transition than a beta -> release transition as the bugs are blattant and trigger easily doing required actions.  The AI is apaulling in that enemy creatures focus on either stacks you can't replace in your base or just smalled stack to penalize for the new moral system rather than actually focus on any of your creatures that matter.  The AI heroes will ignore pretty much anything non-mine or base related and will even sacrifice heroes.  As such, there ai is easy to pick-off and trick into destroying stacks of creatures of your choice.  The weird trend of removing one faction from a previous game is still in trend as there's no infernal faction anymore but the new factions are interesting.  The spells still feel rediculously overpowered for mage heavy characters, but the melee characters are a legitimate alternative now at least.  The base aspects of the game and new features feel good all around, but aren't even close to polished and there are some sever balance issues that need to be addressed to.  Finally the amount of non-campaign maps for single player is beyond pitiful.\n\ntl;dr?\n\nWait for this game to get fixed and improved and then take another look at it later on, but don't get this game as it currently stands as you will just find it frustrating due to the lack of content and massive amount of bugs riddling the game.  The game feels rushed and playing it for even a short time it becomes painfully apparent that the dev team did not have sufficient time / resources, or just didn't take the project seriously.","October 3, 2015","false","32.4"," 136 of 173 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","136","173","5","2"

(I'll talk about inferno later) Oh and what's this? they don't look as detailed! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ all the creatures in the game aren't as detailed as the ones in the game "Heroes of might and magic 6" hell even the terrain in "Heroes of might magic 6" was better. The town screens were better in 6 and the building screen looks less like an orgy in 6. It's just the artists were lazy, otherwise they would have tried harder not to make the golems looks like the golden army in Hell Boy -.- ( I could explore more into this but I am to lazy look into other reviews)\n\nGame-play:\n\nAlright, I'll have to admit the game-play is rewarding BUT not FUN. I say rewarding is because you can try to manage to put up with impossible odds and feel this warm sensation of achievement. It's not fun because you'll be screaming at your screen telling the game to "♥♥♥♥ off" "You can suck ♥♥♥♥" "ETC": for deleting your spells, saves, your sanity, even your love and devotion for the series/franchise. But, the main game-play after you whip everyone's asses calms down to a slow and steady halt... BEFORE IT SAYS NOPE AND JUST RAMS AN ARMY THAT IS BIGGER THAN YOURS UP THE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥ ( This song EXACTLY displays what the game is saying to you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPGa6vzfvqk ). Then there's the most horrible problem this game has. They have glitches. These glitches don't care; they will ram their ♥♥♥♥♥ so far down your throat you will cry and quit the game (Trust me I lost my sanity from this game.) These are so game breaking you can't even complete the whole ♥♥♥♥ing campaign! An example of this was when I was playing my wizards all innocent only to go to the 3rd map to discover that yellow jerk-off yanky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a mother ♥♥♥♥er sitting there on this one linear path that I NEED TO PASS. The glitches in a short sentence is: The glitches will ruin everything for you in the game. Now remember, that one sentence you love (I hope) "it's pretty bad if Heroes of might and magic 6 is better". In fact that game you could do the following: own dynasty equipment, convert towns and forts, play a game that is less bug ridden, have pets that do things for you, actually have story, but most important have good solid game-play not fantastic nor bad but solid. Actually incorporate a difficulty to the game than just spamming armies of the thousands.  Here's the simple solution to fix the game-play problems... alright your ready? Are you sure? Okay, okay just stop screaming at me. Just play Fallout (any fallout).\n\nStory and lore:\n\nOkay, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ but if you get rid of my demons I will flip the ♥♥♥♥ out with my ♥♥♥♥. I mean really? How hard did they have to masturbate to have the idea of getting rid of a core faction to the franchise??? (I told you I would talk about this but NOOO you didn't believe me. Right, back on topic.)  and the story oh god, (also spoilers!) I can't complete the stupid academy campaign (Refer to the paragraph above) and I flat out abandoned it. I don't get the advisors though; in all of my 100+ hours of game-play I have only found ONE advisor incorporated to the escapades of a hero only to disappear the next map which is dungeon. Then there's the Academy where (So far) it's story is so tangled with all of these characters that are introduced out of nowhere you're lost (Well I lost interest in the second mission) like Masfar the old ♥♥♥♥ and then the gay lesbian duo in the first map to the good hearted prince who destroys his hard work in the end to kill some 500+ Shantri titans that appear out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere then you have to travel into this portal to get this flower that somehow ends up in your possession even if the first map hero still has it only to follow a really narrow path, oh and that's as far as I got before that yellow yanky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ got there. Then there's the Orc story which I could NOT give a single solid ♥♥♥♥ about but so far that's the story that I find has a good story in it (mind you I haven't finished Haven nor the Necropolis campaign.). Then there's the weak ♥♥♥ pansy elves who I couldn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ even if you offered me a million dolla... okay maybe not then even if you offer me thousands I would not care and I wouldn't waste my life on that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "Oh I'm a pirate and I am going to help these random ♥♥♥ elves that I JUST MET even if that means I will die to escape this job of being a ship captain which is much easier than helping a bunch of fools. Before being offered a choice in the end to become a captain or a tree hugging hippy." Need I explain more?\n\nLastly, Overall:\n\nOver all I am so disappointed with this game I need to visit the old great games like heroes of might and magic 3 and 5 to try to regain and go back to my love for this franchise and to hopefully regain back my sanity from this egregious piece of ♥♥♥♥, bug ridden, fake heroes of might and magic game. So in the end I am giving it a 3/10 because it has some value and not a lot of value, I deducted points partly from the ♥♥♥♥ing glitches oh the horror, OH THE HORROR! Now a recap: the stories are ♥♥♥♥, the game-play is kind of ♥♥♥♥, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the inferno being removed is ♥♥♥♥ (Seriously I can't get over that), the building mechanics are ♥♥♥♥, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the Orcs are ♥♥♥♥, the elves are ♥♥♥♥, the academy is ♥♥♥♥ for being to overpowered, the elves are definitely ♥♥♥♥, Haven is meh, Necropolis is meh, the custom single player games are ♥♥♥♥, Uplay temporarily down is ♥♥♥♥, Uplay is ♥♥♥♥ for releasing so many buggy games lately, etc.\n\nIndividual scores\nStory - 1/10 --- [See update below. Originally 3/10]\nGame-play - 2/10\nGraphics - 4/10 ( I mean they aren't that bad to me at least could have been better than heroes of might and magic 6)\nTotal: 2/10\n\nDisclaimer - I am too lazy to correct grammar errors you have come across. Thank you for reading though :D\n\nUpdate: Just played the Haven campaign don't know how I persuaded myself but I did, the campaign sucks so much! *BOOM* meaningless map with meaningless character once again! Magic Demon out nowhere (Incorporate my demons already! You already did so. Like shia labeouf said "Just do it!" [Told you I was not letting that go.])  Oh! Wait your dad's a bloodsmith? Don't care, and now he's facing the armada when they could've sent the strongest force to avoid loses, we're so edgy declaring war on the GRYPHON EMPIRE that is ♥♥♥♥ing 10X stronger than your weak ♥♥♥ force. What's the point of these stories if everything is hundreds of years in the past? Lastly, why? Just... why? Making herose worse are you serious? Changing the God-send ability of full range to just a measly 3+ damage to range damage just why? That's going to far with "Balancing issues" Your balancing has now completly destroyed the way the campaign plays. God, these people spent all of their funds on P0RN and not the game itself. Poor, poor developement.","November 25, 2015","false","154.0"," 184 of 252 people (73%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","73","184","252","67","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jt19/recommended/321960/","jt19","ArcaneWeapon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jt19/","91 products in account","To be honest, I'm kind of shocked right now.\n\nTLDR: I go into a lot of details, but overall 7 brings nothing to the table that 6 doesn't already do better.  And the graphics are really terrible.  Thanks to Steam's new refunds I'd recommend checking it out for yourself, but personally I'm going to be refunding this.\n\nI've played every Heroes of Might and Magic game since 4 and I always look forward to the next iteration.  They've had their ups and downs over the years, but each game has changed the gameplay in a refreshing manner while still sticking true to what we've come to know and love about the series (for the most part).  Sadly, 7 falls FAR short of this.\n\nFirst off the biggest and most upsetting part of the game that struck me right off: the art.  This is 2015.  Games are coming out each looking more beautiful and amazing than the last.  And yet this game looks like it came out 10 years ago.  You start the campaign to horribly low poly 3D models that they were even too lazy to even animate.  The 2D drawings that introduce the individual factions campaigns looks better than this horrific series of still shots of 3D models.  In game, the art is all much lower quality than it was in 6 as well, I even booted it back up afterwards just to make sure it wasn't my imagination.  I'm running both games on High and it's night and day between the two games with 6 easily looking far better.\n\nBut gameplay is what really matters at the heart of things.  I was willing to overlook the shockingly poor art quality if the game at least played well.  It doesn't.\n\nI started on the Dungeon campaign since they're my favorite faction (YAY, they're not DLC this time!) and was insantly disapointed that everything looks exactly as if I were playing Heroes 6 (minus the crappy art of course).  The buildings your heroes interact with are all identical in appearance and functionality, most everything seems completly reused.  Navigation is the same as always as is town manegment (although more on that in a bit).  My first hero leveled up easily thanks to a 1k exp shrine and I was taken to the talent wheel to pick a new skill.  Selection seems to be drastically down from the customization you had in 6.  I can't comment on this too much though since I never got a hero to level 3 to select more than one new skill.\n\nCombat is identical to 6.  Heroes behave exactly the same, attacking or using a spell once per turn.  Troops act based off of initiative and use luck and morale identically.  In fact the only difference I noticed at all in combat was that the game lied to me and told me that my units wouldn't be retaliated against when, in fact, they were causing me to lose half my assassin stack.  However, unlike in 6 there's no rewarding audio or animation on attacks.  Your units just sluggishly walk around the board and half-assedly wack your opponents with no real impact.  A large part of this is likely the lack of any real good audio cues possibly, but combat just seemed really dull and boring.\n\nSo back to town manegment.  Town screens are animated and look decent so that fiasco from 6 didn't repeat itself.  I do have to say that the town screen is actually quite beautiful.  The Dungeon town is by FAR the best looking art I saw in the game, if only the rest of the game had recieved the same treatment as this.  I'm not a fan of the building upgrade UI, but that's pretty minor.\n\nOh and Inferno fans?  Your faction was removed, so if you don't like playing the other factions you should probably steer clear.  Maybe they'll get the DLC treatment that Dungeon got in 6, but considering how much outrage that recieved I'm pretty shocked they did it again.  On second thought, maybe it's not actually that surprising.\n\nSo to wrap everything up, ultimately to me 7 feels like a DLC extension to 6.  The game looks the same (only worse), plays the same, and just doesn't seem to do anything that 6 isn't already doing just as well if not better.  The game also performs far worse on my computer for some reason, averaging around 20 FPS at High as opposed to the 50 FPS I get on High with 6.  The lack of Inferno as a faction is incredibly annoying and if it ends up being DLC as well it just seems incredibly greedy.  I'm going to be refunding the game and sticking to 6 since it just seems like a better game to me.","September 29, 2015","false","1.3"," 199 of 279 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","199","279","5","3"

I have played all the other Heroes games, with 2 and 3 probably being among my favorites.\n\nI was excited to get into a new Heroes game, with fresh updates on graphics and gameplay.  What I got was a whole lot of disappointment.\n\nWhile the graphics look nice, I feel like 6 was cleaner looking and in motion.  The animations are clunky, from movement to attacks.  And the combat sounds.  Oh good grief, the combat sounds.  They are either horrible, or flat out don't exist.  There are no impact noises to speak of.  The music will play once through, then just stop.  So you are playing a battle, which should be exciting, without much combat sounds, and no music.  It's horrible, and ruins the gameplay for me.\n\nAnd the don't get me started on the cinematics.  They are atrocious.  It's 2015, and every charcter stands frozen like a statue, giving speeches without moving lips or their bodies.  I enjoyed the opening cinematic from Heroes 3 far more than I did this one, which is saying something.\n\nUntil these things are fixed (specifically the buggy sounds, and the non existant sounds), I have no desire to play this game.  It should never have come out of beta like this, and needs quite a bit more time to develop.  I cannot recommend this game, and that saddens me, for my first review and because it's a franchise I love.  If the game gets updated and fixed to work properly, I will edit my review.  Until then, don't buy it.  You'll be disappointed.","September 29, 2015","false","6.1"," 121 of 162 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","121","162","2","1"

I am going to keep it sweet and simple just to stop others falling into the same trap I did.\n\nAfter reading many negative reviews, I decided to give the game a go any way as most of the reviews seemed to revolve around issues with multiplayer. I wanted to play the campaign or single player vs AI so I gave it a go. After about 20 hours of playing the extremely EASY and lacklustre campaigns.. I was still actually have fun as some of the game mechanics are really good. The campaigns dont really progress however and so 1 map you might start of with a level 5 hero, the next you are playing a different hero who is already level 20. This didn't really gel with me   and I began to see that rather than take my time to explore each map the best thing to do was simply beeline straight towards the finish line  and the campaigns really are easy. I found no real difference between playing on normal or playing on heroic - so I just jacked it right up to heroic just to try and give myself the illusion of progression on each map.\n\nSo then I decided to try single player vs AI. No simultaneous turns and the time between your turns really is ridiculous. I found myself reading a book or applying for jobs in between my turns - which hey actually I didn't mind but really shouldn't be necessary. AND THE BUGS. Oh my gosh there are a lot of them, bugs ranging from some of your building not working, your strategic spells not working, things which are only meant to let you cast a spell once per combat seem to increase this spell count each combat you are in until you can cast said spell an unlimitted amount of times (and your spellbook is fullup with multiple copies of the same spell. Let's say you are defending in a seige and someone flies over your wall and you decide to shoot them with a crossbow, well because they are now on your side of the wall they get a cover bonus even though they are standing about 1m away from you with no wall inbetween.\n\nA lot of the bugs I could forgive as many of them cancel each other out - 1 bug hinders you and (although I felt like I was cheating) another bug will aid you. But I can not forgive game-breaking bugs that pop up many hours into a game and just render the game a complete waste of time. An example of this is when I defeated an enemy hero inside their city. I gained control of the city and the game informed me that player had been defeated. However his hero still took up the hero slot inside the city. This meant that I could not enter or exit any units or heros from this city what-so-ever.\n\nThis is turning out not as short and nowhere near as sweet as I was hoping.\n\nTL;DR: game is fun at first until you realize the abundance of bugs and lack of polish and care. Combine that with game breaking bugs that will waste hours at a time this game really is not worth it in its current state. Once the bugs are dealt with multiplayer may be fun but single player will surely still be lacking.","October 9, 2015","false","44.2"," 78 of 99 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","78","99","0","2"

Then what do I see? Mistakes after mistakes. First you had the audacity to put Inferno up for a vote with Dungeon, do you know how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is? Now the game is without Inferno and Dungeon is the only villain (barely), do you know how boring that is?\n\nThen you had the gall to use recycled assets, again! You had plenty of time but you just chose not to put in the money and effort. But what bothers me is you keep saying that this is a great comeback, something that resembles H3 and H5. And look at what you have made, what a disgrace.\n\nThe artstyle is not worthy of the Heroes name and the townscreens are the most hideous I've ever seen. Also if you don't fix the still 3D figures at the council table, it will be a laughing stock for eternity. Characters talking without animation, only you can make something so stupid like this, Ubi.\n\nPlenty of people were vocal about the right direction the game should take while it was being developed, but you just had to do it the hard way. You have to make your own pizza wheel and change the whole thing after release. Today as of 5/20/2016 you have delayed the patch that's supposed to fix the dumb AI and a bunch of other game-breaking bugs, are you out of your mind? Nearly 1 year after initial release this game still has the dumbest AI on the planet. You do know the current state of the AI completely undermines the very fundamentals of the game right? Have you stopped giving ♥♥♥♥s altogether?\n\nWell I have. I saw you terminating the PR stunt (shutting down the SC site) and releasing these half-♥♥♥♥♥ patches. I feel like the goal of these unhelpful patches are here to say that "we still offer game support" (no you don't" instead of solving actual problems.\n\nPerhaps while Far Cry and Assassin's Creed keep making you money you don't care how this franchise does because it doesn't have any sentimental value to you and you'll trash it like so when the fans won't simply take whatever piece of trash you handed to them, but hey, ♥♥♥♥ you.","May 20","false","62.5"," 59 of 74 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","59","74","7","0"

That said, now at version 1.8, it is a very solid game that is virtually bug free.  Do not let reviews screaming about bugs scare you as those versions are a thing of the past.  Hopefully it'll serve Ubisoft a lesson in ensuring a quality release next time around, but don't pass up an incredibly strong HoMM game due to a botched, but since fixed release.  Overall the game is vastly superior to HoMM 6 in every way.\n\nThe strong positives are as follows:\nThe story - by far the best HoMM story to date.  It is very well written and told exceptionally well\nThe art - Beautiful artistic cut scenes and images really enrichen the game's experience\nContent - The game comes with 27 missions (7 campaigns) worth of single player campaigns and has added another 10 missions (2 campaigns) in the free patch updates\nGameplay - Overall a significant improvement over HoMM6.  Much of the unbalancing that ruined HoMM6 has been fixed.\nSkill system - Thankfully went back to the skill wheel, similar to HoMM5 so that every hero doesn't wind up as an exact carbon copy of each other.\nFun factor - it's just a fun game to play\n\nThe mediocrity is as follows:\nAI - AI is being updated through the patches, but still falls short of what I consider the best AI in the series of HoMM5.  The AI performs acceptably in battle, but on the world map it is much too passive and not resilient.  On normal and hard difficulty (heroic is the toughest) your toughest challenges will be the neutral monsters.\nGraphics - The graphics are nice, but not much improved since HoMM6.\n\nThe ugly/bad is as follows:\nThe 3d rendering is not animated during story sequences - this is really only problematic during the Council story sessions as during the mission cut scenes the way the story is told, the frozen 3d scenes are appropriate.  Trying to get through the dialogue of the Council in real time is pretty cringe worthy though.\n\nOverall:\nStrongly recommended","April 15","true","50.4"," 69 of 95 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","69","95","2","0"

Since the King's Bounty, that, original one on XT. Heroes III were the best. Heroes IV were bearable. Heroes V with all addons are currently my favorite. Heroes VI were bearable, no RMG made it rather short experience, but it was nice. Not the best, but nice.\n\nBut this one ... well, they've managed to completely ruin the franchise. Cutscenes are just a joke, really, they look like first attempt to use 3D modeler. It's not bad, it's terrible. Gameplay is dumb as hell - no story, nothing, Hust go to "that" gate, kill that pack of monsters. AI is like a newborn baby. It knows how to move these little figures. That's it. UI looks like a 1998 web-site with all those "leopard-texture-graphical-buttons" and terrible, just unbelievable non-user-friendly UI/UX. Any aspect of this game is ugly. You just want to tear off your eyes after 10 minutes looking into this game UI. Graphics, well, it look worse than 2010 low-cost strategy games. you can't see that on screenshots, you got to see that in action to be fully thrilled with the ugliness of this.\n\nI'm not even comparing it to any of the games in franchise.

Interface lags.\n- I myself am at human campaign lvl 4 where cities are present on both sides and halfway through a lot is laggy and loading takes extremely long or doesn't work at all.......\n- so i can't continue the playing.\n\n=====================\nIt's not worth the price. If it was 25-35,- price range it would be worth it.  (probably 20-25,- when the novalty of release has worn off.)\nAll the visual elements don't come across Tripple A quality or pricing but more of an experienced indie dev. I'm reminded by the difference between Simcity and City Skyline but I'm not sure the gameplay advantage City Skyliners has is valid for this game. Add the major Lag bugs and you don’t see gameplay compensating for lower visuals.\n(for a quick view of what gameplay they improved on look at the last paragraph)\n\n\nMisleading\nI find the ingame pictures  on store page misleading. It feels like they added more saturation and bloom effect in photoshop. I'd suggest watching gameplay footage on youtube.\n\n\nAesthetics and Visual Design\nThere is no good overall aesthetic design. Even when the models have the detail they they don't come out that well in the game like it does with the previous HoMM 6. The game also uses many models of HoMM 6, not necessarily problem if the price was right and more was improved graphically.\n\nAnimation, special effects and audio is also of lower quality than HoMM 6.  This all contributes to a lower ambiance than the players had of the previous title.\n\nInterface feels outdated, some elements are good to decent and others are not and in some areas feel unfinished. There is also lag in the interface where it does not properly update elements fast enough.\n\n\nGameplay\nAll the previous elements contribute to the overall experience the gameplay gives, but looking at the gameplay alone I'm not sure of it yet. It feels like there is more diversity in heroes type, more construction options and there are more factions to play compared to Homm6. The skill system is new and the morality system is gone which is probably an improvement. From what I've played and seen I expect a bit slower pacing than HoMM 6, giving you a more wide world exploration experience like the old games. This I see as a positive. The garrison system I really like and is a very nice addition that prevents leaving everything unguarded. I also want to add the Governor system, it's a nice interesting innovation, although i'm not sure about certain bonuses are worth the skill investment.\n\nBut when compared to HoMM 5 or the ones before I don't think the gameplay is broader, probably smaller. The Game-editor might be one HoMM7 strenght which is pretty good from what I heard.\n\n\n\nBugs:\n- Interface lag\n- Long wait times for computer movement\n- Multiplayer problems\n- Combat bug where you can’t move forward and with wait or defend for bonus turn\n- Windows 10 problems\n- More\n\nWhat I’d have liked:\nLooking at it now, I wish they just expanded upon HoMM6 since the visuals are good there. Just upgrade that engine add 2-3 factions and put some gameplay changes they made in HoMM7 like:\n- 1 extra resource\n- slower pacing (more world exploration feel)\n- Garrison system\n- 2-3 factions added\n- Unit/construction options\n- More heroes class types. (liked the new skill system)\n- Removal of morality\n- Governor system (seems interesting and new innovation)\n- A good editor","October 3, 2015","false","55.5"," 51 of 69 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","51","69","0","1"

I attempted to close the game and reload, thinking it was just a glich and that restarting might correct the issue, but of course it did not.

I tried once more today after they released the 1.2 patch, and I'm sorry to say it still feels like ♥♥♥♥ trying to play this mess. My honest opinion is that this particular game in the once-glorious series will NEVER be good. HoMM 6 wasnt great either, but at least became something half-decent after 6+ months. MMH7 however, will stay as a disgrace in every fan's memories.\n\n\nPros:\n\n* Caravans are back\n\nCons:\n\n* The color palette is non-existent. It's like playing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game called 423789421 shades of grey. Everything is washed out. I can't remember how many times I missed resources on the map.\n* Animations (unit/hero) are exremely clunky. I played this crap on a high-end Alienware laptop, and even on lowest settings you can plainly see the the clunkiness. It's not your rig's power, but the optimization that sucks.\n* combat : OMFG!! Worst ♥♥♥♥ing part. Sounds are terrible, half the units are recycled from HoMM 6, animations are ♥♥♥♥, spells are buggy, heroes look bland, etc etc\n* AI: a ♥♥♥♥ing mongoloid is smarter. after patch 1.2, they stated "it's a work in progress" lol.\n* Multiplayer: even after patch 1.2, the games still desync after a few turns. what a failure.\n* voice-acting: a russian ♥♥♥♥ could do a better job\n* Campaigns: meaningless stories that arent even connected\n* character models : on par with Quake 1 (well, ok, Quake 2)\n* Uplay\n* UBILOL\n\nI sincerely hope UBILOL goes out of business.

I remember when heroes VI came out and they said they couldn't make a 3d map maker, it would be to dificult and to expensive, turns out they where right on the expensive part, as the game is severly lacking.\n\nAI could be patched later, but the fact that so many champaign games have gamebreaking bugs in them, at launch is rediculus. Those are mostly fixed now, but what really breakes it for me is the out of sync errors on multiplayer, even over a LAN network whitout simultainius turns and whitout spectateing combats I can never get a game to last longer then 2 weeks if im LUCKY.\n\nI like the new flanking mechanics, but I dont like the change to warcries, or the fact that you can't make a custom hero anymore like you could in VI.

I have played all of them since HOMM3.  While this game does have several interesting features (i enjoy the new leveling system for example), the game is, for the most part, quite broken.  Though the dev team is working constantly and pumping out patches fairly quickly, the multiplayer is still broken after 5 major updates (each of which somehow manages to be a whopping 2 GB).\n\nI am unable to play a LAN game without the game going out of sync.  Sometimes this take a week or two, sometimes I can't even make it through a single turn.  It is the most infuriating game that I have played in quite some time, and I wish that I could still get my money back for it.  The campaigns are truly awful, there is no random map generator, and only 9 maps to play on (for skirmishes or multiplayer) and 7 extra scenarios.  The "movies" in game are only slightly moving 2d stills, and the 3d town interface is gone, going back to a town interface almost identical to the one used in HOMM3.\n\nAnd for all of this, the game uses a ridiculous amount of system resources for what is given to us.  In short this will most likely be the last game that I purchase from Ubitrash.  Good job guys!

The creatures, the buildings, the spells, the heroes, the whole map, basically everything looked bland, pale and washed out (the music was ok).\n\n-Heroes 5 (or in my view the true Heroes 4) was enjoyable. the style was a bit cartoony but overall it was a decent game and thank god the didnt follow up on homm4's system of spells, creatures and buildings.\n\n-Heroes 6.. well all i can say is that heroes 6 was from another planet. They changed so much that it felt like a complete different game (in a bad way). I didnt recognize anything and couldnt relate to the games of old (ill call it the HoMM3 feeling). It was too smooth, too sci-fi... IMO..\n\n-Now the review of the version that matters here: HoMM7 !! (108 hours played so far)\n\nThe game has a lot of positive and a bit of negative.\n\n-Looks: heroes on minimap and in combat look amazing, creatures, spells (great effects. Spells feel like your doing something big now), environment (Focus!! your in combat but damn that little streamlet oozing gently throught the landscape looks legit. Or the volcanic landscape where your screen actually shakes because of nearby eruptions.. SICK), basically everything! No negatives there.\n\n-Bugs: to my knowledge and experience non-existent (anymore perhaps?! I didnt play it at release date).\n\n-gameplay: smooth. Perhaps a little too much, because when i wanted to dig up the grail i was looking for the dig option for a good 10 minutes before i found out its an option in your spellbook... So not a 10/10 here.\n\n-Music and sounds: Maybe a little more soundtracks would make it perfect but overall it sounds nice.  8/10 in my book.\n\n-Towns: you actually have a town view again!! ty! and FU heroes 6.. When you add a building you  can actually see it in your town view. ther is a clear section where you have your hall of heroes (tavern), marketplace, warmachines (blacksmith), caravan overview etc. etc. I like it 8/10\n\n-Multiplayer/hotseat: Very disappointing really. Im talking about the amount of maps available. 10 in total with like only 2-3 large maps. Its just way Way WAY to few maps to choose from. Given theres a map editor but who has the time or will or more importantly the skill to make well thought out maps of his own. I dont have a lot of free time and i just want to play a map instead of create one. I want a map to be a surprise , so that i dont know where everything is located etc.\n\n-Factions/Races whatever..: Too few. This has been an issue with all of the HoMM versions past HoMM3. But this time we dont even have the "Inferno/Devil/Demon" faction... WTF I really hope that there will be some new races being added in future patches.\n\nSo to conclude my rantings:\n\nHeroes of Might and Magic 7 is a good game. It again gave me a bit of  that feeling i had when i first started playing the HoMM series. If Ubisoft finetunes this game with future patches and additions in terms of maps, campaigns and factions (maybe 2-3 more) this will be a great game instead of a good one.","March 17","true","126.8"," 55 of 79 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","55","79","0","0"

It takes a bit to get used to the way the skill tree is made, but it's easily understood.\n\nThe only real downsides at the moment are a minor bug in the way you can share artefacts between heroes (a know bug which should be treated soon) and the fact that the campaign videos start with 'statue like' heroes, which have no lip movement, no expression, it's like stone. I guess I can live with that, the hero and unit variation is nice.\n\nIf these issues will be treated, it'll be 100% a solid continuation.

I can hear my computer ( a very high end gaming rig) working hard but don't really see the benefits. This game is not SkyRim.. you don't play it for the graphics.  Most of the changes are for the worse, in my opinion. You can no longer convert conquered towns to your faction, fully recover your creatures (if a necromancer) and the AI is really, really dumb.

The AI is useless, they don't even pick up valuables on their piece of the map and they leave castles untouched, even if there's no defence.\n\nI feel like they are targeting the wrong audience, this is not a mobile game.","September 29, 2015","false","6.0"," 65 of 102 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","65","102","0","0"

That is an easy fix, presumably, but it makes things just a tad bit more painful.\n\nThe hero creation seems to be confined to the map editor and I have not yet worked out a way to create my own hero for use across multiple maps - so far as I can work it out, it seems like the only way to play custom heroes is by editing them into individual maps. That's a pretty big pain and kind of a downer as I would much rather play my own custom than the premade heroes.\n\nThe campaign has a good story, but there are some flaws in the presentation. Namely that the opening "cinematics" aren't really animated. The council talks, there IS voice acting, but since nothing is animated you just end up with a camera panning around to look at still, unmoving faces.\n\nOn the second map of the Academy campaign, the enemy AI seeks refuge in a "shelter" of sorts and refuses to leave... leaving you unable to complete the map. You might be able to have one of your heroes make a B-line for the sanctuary and try to occupy it first, but I have not tested this. I have tried moving heroes away from the vicinity of the sancturary in order to lure out the enemy AI's hero, but that does not work. I even tried having my heroes garrison themselves in towns, but even that did not lure out the enemy AI. Thus, map 2 of the Academy campaign is not completed on my game.\n\nDespite what some other users are saying, the game does run fine on my PC (windows 10) and has not crashed or had any sort of slow down. Uplay, while I don't particularly enjoy having to use it, also works fine. The game's graphics are nice, I like a lot of the animations for the spells and units, and the soundtrack is pretty nice so far.\n\nI think that, overall, much effort was put into this game. If you take a moment to analyze the details, you can see that the team worked really hard on the game. I just don't believe that their hard work is finished yet. If the campaign is fixed (or that sanctuary shelter thing is removed), random maps generate in the right location, and you are able to actually make your hero in the game to play across multiple maps, then I would say that this game is much more in line with what I had hoped for. As it stands now, however, the inability to complete the Academy campaign, random map problems, and lack of my own hero are pretty disheartening.\n\nHopefully I am mistaken and there is a way to make your own hero, fix the location of random maps, etc.","September 29, 2015","false","5.0"," 62 of 97 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","62","97","0","0"

For example, my heroes tend to lose ALL THEIR SKILLS after a save/reload or when going from one map to another in the same campaign. This bug defies the very meaning of the game, which is to build and improve our hero(es) over time.\n\nApart from the bugs, the game itself feels bland and uninspired. My favorite heroes titles are II, III and V, and this chapter just doesn't feel the same. It looks more like a cheap copy of those great titles.\nIf you are new to series, I suggest you avoid this title. Here on Steam you can get Heroes V: Tribes of the East and Heroes III, which are still *amazing* games.\n\nI've bought the game during Fall sales, and I'm still wondering if -35% was cheap enough for this title.

I actually feel bad for the devs!\n\nThere are some REALLY cool ideas and returning ideas from previous titles in this one like the town building "tree" and the towns look great themselves, plus more resources is nice and there just random tid bits thrown in that make you go "oh thats nice"\n\nNow heres why this is a negative review. THIS GAME NEEDED AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR of SOLID DEVELOPEMENT.\n\nPeriod.\n\nEverything from the reused units and animations and sounds from 6 (yet somehow they all feel and look crappier) to the fact it lacks SO MUCH POLISH badly, and not even in a "this game crashes a lot" way, but you constantly see units "skate" or "hydroplane" across the battle / campaign map or be doing an animation the wrong way (moonwalking orcs anyone!?) to just doing the wrong one flat out.\n\nThe sound is TERRIBLE, just anything from music to sound effects. Hell a lot aren't even synced up right with animations.\n\nThose nice HOMM6 mission intros, outros and stuff? All the cinmatics are pictures of models that clearly had intended to be animated but aren't. It's hilarious.\n\nThe units look TERRIBLE not to mention some are just so stupid for the race, or even the entire races theme in general, anything from the fact that the haven faction is mostly reused stuff to nagas being called a medusa and now a dungeon unit... Trust me when I say the units look bad graphically AND theme wise for their respective race. Not to mention how pathetic towns look on the campaign map artwork (however the town screen itself is quite nice) it doesn't even change anymore at all it seems! I seriously doubt it does but it doesn't matter anyway because they all look terrible.\n\nAll in all, this game took a look at some of the old good heroes of M&M like 3 and 5 and SOME stuff of 6 and that stuff makes you WANT to like this game, it really does! However the glaring fact this games budget was slashed or time cut WAYYYYYYY too short, and the awful art direction race wise makes me honestly say avoid this game at all costs.\n\nGo to gog.com and get heroes of M&M 3 complete, the chronicles of tarnum (yes all 8 ((?)) of them) and HOMM5 complete and M&MH6.\n\nThose are way better.

In the end I had to download an update patch directly from Ubisoft and bypass Steam in order to play.\n\nLike M&M VI, you have to play this game online using Ubisoft's portal, even though the main campaign is single player only. VII has a similar look and feel to VI when you start out but once you get into the game you realize how poorly this game is designed (at least in my opinion.)\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Skill wheel from earlier versions is back! But none of the skills actually cross-link nor is there an "uber" skill available if you choose to learn all the skills in the 3 special catagories for any hero.\n- Former games allowed you to bond with heroes by building them up from scratch at level 1 through 30 through multiple campaign maps.  Most maps in the campaign scenarios don't continue with the same hero you built up from the last one and the new one they provide you for the 2nd or 3rd map in the scenario is already pre-built and leveled.\n- AI is pathetic!  Strong AI heroes will bypass your weak castles, forts, etc.. on their way to their target.\n- Combat AI is no better.  At first AI creatures would always move forward automatically right into range of your creatures.  All you had to do was tell your creatures to wait till AI creatures have moved first.  After a recent patch, AI creatures now wait as well, but unfortunately this also includes all ranged AI creatures allowing you always to get your ranged shots off first.\n- Battles are ridiculously slow, especialy if you have healing or war units, even when fastest battle options are chosen.\n- There does not seem to be any option to make AI heroes aggressive.  All you can do is alter starting resources, weekly resource gain, or neutral creature growth in order to try to make the game difficult.\n- Final campaign map can be completed using a side hero with your main hero and others only required to collect resources!\n\nAfter playing all the campaigns from start to finish I can honestly say this game is very repititious, not very challenging, and disappointing.\n\nEven with the negative changes found in M&M VI, at least they included some very interesting "Boss" fights during the campignes which would have been nice to see continued in VII.","May 10","false","24.6"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","30","43","2","0"

Until we realise that, developers will keep on doing this s**t, because we're still going to buy this for "nostalgia" or other reasons, so why put effort into it?\n\n\n\nOh yeah: TL/DR warning ahead, skip to the bottom for conclusion.\n\n\nLet's start. First off: "teh bugz".\n\nThey are everywhere. EVERY. WHERE. I can't fight other heroes, because it crashes. I can't load a game, because it crashes. I can't edit a map, because it crashes. Can't do this, can't do that... basically, don't do ANYTHING, beacuse it may crash.\nHow can you ♥♥♥♥ up Unreal Engine like this? I saw hobbyist developers, HOBBYIST DEVELOPERS do better stuff in UE than these "Professional" (I put it in quotes because they are clearly not professionals at all). Hell, 7dfps people do better than this, IndieDB, GameJolt... sure it's hard to compare because this game is massive and those are indie games, which means they are smaller, but there is no excuse for so many bugs. Why? Because these people are supposed to be "Pros". GameJolt, 7dfps, IndieDB (and other sites) they are indie devs and their games have less bugs than this AAA+ title. It's kind of expected now in 2015.\n\n\nNext, let's tackle "teh grafics".\n\nThey... I think they kind of fit. The UI is a mad mix between Heroes of Might & Magic V and Heroes of Might & Magic III, it's kind of appealing. To me at least. The town building is OK, the town screen is a MAJOR step backwards from Heroes of Might & Magic V. I thought it was AWESOME when for the first time, we finally could see the city 360 style! It was sooo awesome! Aaaand then came Heroes of Might & Magic VI... aaaaaaand then came Heroes of- oh sorry, it's no longer called Heroes of, now it's just Might & Magic VII...\nGraphical glitches... are rare, which is surprising. Really. After you look at the campaign menu and you see the STATIC MODELS "talk" to each other you are surprised that the rest of the game has animations and almost no graphical glitches. I wish I could rotate the map 360 as  well, but no, of course not. They have to hide unfinished assets somehow. The underground world is a joke. It doesn't look different than overworld. In III, V and EVEN VI, you could clearly distinguish underground from overworld. Here though... It's a mess. One big pile of kaka.\nAnother thing that gets me: Heroes V, when you selected a monster and wanted to know more about it, you saw it's 3D model next to the book with all the data and you could easily compare the monster's upgraded version with the standard one. Here... you get a short bio! No, like REALLY short. It's amasing that these bios are longer than 10 words. Oh yeah, and instead of a cool 3D model, you get a "cool" concept art thingy. Another step backwards. Sure the 3D in V was not very good and the animations and models were more... childish, but... really? A concept art painting? *sigh*...\n\n\nBut we're not done yet...\n\nTeh epic soundz...\nYeah if only they were epic... The VO (Voice over) is... meh. it's not good, not terrible, not ok... just meh. The sounds aren't always synchronised with the animations. It's surprising that they ARE synchronised most of the time. REALLY. I am serious. It's especially evident in combat if you set the speed higher or slower than 100%. Ridiculous.\nOther sounds and music... it's meh. Want a visual representation? Do a thumbs-up, turn it sideways and then turn it a little more downwards, but not completely down and there you have it.\n\n\nThe A.I.\nOhhh boooy... since we're talking about A.I., I bet that Spielberg's movie is better than this one. I can't really compare, because like I said in "Teh bugz" section, I can't fight the other heroes at all, both the A.I. and other player's heroes. It's not just ridiculous. It's ludicrous. I can't fight heroes, in heroes game. WAT.\n\n\nBUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET!\n\nThe map editor.\nYou think it su**s? You bet it su**s. I can start it, sure, but can I edit anything? Well yes, I can click on "new". Guess what happens then? Did you guess crash? Because if you did, then you are 10000% correct. Again, it's ludicrous, because the editor is the DEFAULT MAP EDITOR from UDK and UE3. You even have an option to SWITCH THAT VIEW. WHY? WHAT IS THE REASON!? Did they forget to edit it out? Were they too lazy to? Were they too busy wiping their virtual/real bottoms with our virtual/real money? WHAT!? WHY!?\n\n\n\nTL/DR (IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY FINAL THOUGHTS, IF NOT SKIP EVEN MORE):\n\n\nFINALLY:\n\nTeh conclusion.\nIt s***s. Of the 3 new Heroes, this one is THE WORST. There is no comparison. I could play VI, it was not as good as V and not as memorable as III, but I could play it at least. The sounds are meh, the graphics are OK, the A.I. is most likely meh, the UI is OK.\nBetween these new 3 Heroes, I would recommend V with the expansion packs. It's the closest thing you can get to Heroes III and V is the best of the new 3D Heroes. Compared to this, it's perfect. Compared to VI, it's excellent.\nOh yeah and may I ask WHY is there no Inferno? Why are so many factions missing? "Because story, duuhhh". Bulls**t. We always had Inferno. There is also one more faction missing (I think? IDK, they were not so memorable as the factions from Heroes III.) from the previous games.\nWait, I just figured out WHY it's missing. DLC! Yes! Brilliant! Yeah, that's the way to do it! You think they will feel ashamed that they are doing this? You really think so? Go back, all the way up in my review and answer again, or let me answer for you: No, of course they're not going to feel ashamed, because people WILL buy the DLC, because "nostalgia", because "I can't play without my teh best faction evaa", because of "reasons".\nI can't belive I wasted my money on the deluxe edition, I could get Metal Gear Solid or Fallout 4 FOR THE SAME PRICE AND I know that Metal Gear Solid will work and I'll have 50+ hours of fun with it and I'm 90% sure that Fallout 4 will work. The rest 10% is reserved for bugs, but nonetheless I will have 50+ hours of fun with it as well.\n\n\n\nTL/DR:\n\nDon't buy this, it's kaka, if you want 3D Heroes that is the closest you can get to Heroes III, get Heroes V. It may be more childish (for my taste at least), but it's the best 3D Heroes there is. If you don't want 3D Heroes, get Heroes III with ALL the DLC on GOG. If you don't want Heroes at all, save yourself the trouble, save those additional 10 euros or whatever your currency is and buy Metal Gear Solid V, Fallout 4, Just Cause 3, Xcom 2, etc. etc.\n\nThis is the last product I bought from Ubis**t. No, really, it is. I'm done. I'm done with Heroes and Ubis**t. That's it. Keep in mind that those stars do not replace "-of-" in their name, they replace nasty letters "-hi-" and if you combine this with "Ubis--t" you get a very plesant word.","October 5, 2015","false","15.4"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","25","35","2","0"

In fact, I think cutscense in HoMM3 is even better than it, you must know it's a game published in 16 years ago. UI is also unfriendly. You can't cancel your order with right click. Exit button of each form isn't obvious. It makes your operation unsmooth.

Do not buy this game, if you can help it. As a big fan of the series from HM 3 to HM 6 I was excited that the new HM game is coming. But I feel now that this is a big let down. Well lets just summarize it.\n\nPros\n- nice 3D models and particle effects\n- dungeon and sylvan factions are back in the game (not DLC this time)\n\nCons\n- a lot of bugs/crashes, it crashes for me during the start\n- mission objectives are randomly not working (preventing player from finishing the campaign mission)\n- very cheap cinematic\n- cheap sounds\n- no feel of progression, you have all missions except one unlocked from the beginning\n- no progression in the missions - you can build every building and unit from the beginning\n- a lot of models are re-used from HM 6\n- Uplay is forced upon player again\n- AI is dumb during combats\n\nThere is nothing that previous titles in the series have not done better already. Also shortage of new, fresh good ideas and overall feeling of laziness stems from the game on every corner. Do your wallet a favour and stay away. If you still want to buy it wait for discount, this game is surely not worth 40 euro.","October 2, 2015","false","20.1"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","1"

As the technology improves, the games also improve in many aspects but it still takes a good story teller and someone familiar with the "lore" or history of the game. The strategy RPG category of games has a huge competitive field and keeping fans becomes a challenge. When HoMM VI first came out it too was full of "bugs" but eventually they were fixed ( some never got fixed but that is another story). I am hopeful that the bugs in this latest install ment of HoMM will be fixed eventually also. For a first time player of HoMM, they may find the game a bit of a bore. This version is sadly lacking in the beautiful art work that I found in version VI. The art work here in VII looks like preliminary sketches.\n\nBadly disappointed in this version but still hoping it will get better.

However, I will never let this get to the point of me missing out on a great experience.\n\nTo the game itself:\n\nOn launch (once you get past any uplay annoyances, some may experience none, some may) the game presents itself as a rusty old game. Shamefull still camera shots with voice dialog and poorly rendered images. You honestly need to see it to believe you just bought a AAA release. I felt like I was playing an Alpha, let alone beta/early access.\n\nWanting to really enjoy this game i skipped to the actual gameplay. They have kind of gone back to thier roots, it does feel alot more like 3 or 5 but without any polish. The map is awkward to control but suffienct. The graphics are nothing like the screenshots (I play on max, which doesnt take a super comp). I liked the gameplay, it was very much more of the same (heroes 6) but felt a bit shallow. I thought I was enjoying it but before I'd played an hour I was very much telling myself I can't wait to play this game when they have done testing and optimising, before remembering this is the full release.\n\nWith some beta testing this could be one of the best HOMM's (post release comment intended)","September 29, 2015","false","1.1"," 52 of 86 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","52","86","0","0"

This game is buggy as hell. Crashes, negative exp for fights, resetting levels of heroes endless turns (my hero reseted his move points for about 10 times during a single turn) and more stupid things happens from time to time.\n2. Inadequate tooltips (at least in Russian). For example when I first got the heal spell during the campaign I read its tooltip and it said: heals 0-0 hp to damaged units ressurecting any dead units if it can. While at first heal does not resurrect and moreover it heals for a bit more than 0. Overall it's extremly common that tooltip gives you a range of damage and you deal damage lesser or greater than possible.\n3. AI is really bad. While on the tactical map it barely works (it's awfull: it can not focus fire stacks, never waits even if it is reasonable, can try to kill a fire elem with fire... But combat AI never was a strong part of heroes), on the strategic map it's almost useless - it ignores loot, travels with empty heroes to your lands and more stupid things.\n4. Campaign story is really boring. And campaign is too easy even on the highest difficulty level (it will be easy even if they increase all enemy troops by a factor of 1.5) almost all battles can be easily win with no losses, but AI is stupid and plays them very poor so autocombat is not a variant. This makes campaign even more boring, playing all subcampaigns looks like a torture (i gave up to boredom after one and a half).\n\n","October 2, 2015","false","40.0"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","27","42","0","0"

As far i see it all the negative for singleplayer is gone.\nThe in game graphics are in my opnion very very nice. True, lots of units of heroes 6 are the same, but the artwork on the units, townscreen and map is great. The cutscenes graphics in the campaigns are maby not up to date, but then this game is not about the latest graphics technology. Go play the Witcher 3 if you want that.\n\nThe gameplay is very nice too. Better than AoW 3? I think so. AoW 3 is like running around with the Magnificent 7. Units are more like sidekicks.\n\nIn the old days i have hat so much fun with multilplay H3.

The storylines, for me personally, were engaging and entertaining, and the combat was well-balanced and very enjoyable the way the new systems worked.\n\nI enjoyed the music, I enjoyed each campaign (passed each), and was overall very impressed with the changes to the way the town systems work, loved the way capturing a city would automatically grant you control of all mines and dwellings within its sphere of influence, and also really liked the way that hero skill points were distributed.\n\nI dunno, for my money, this was more than worth it.

However, I am no Heroes fan who enjoys playing online. The Heroes of Might and Magic series has and will always be an offline experience for me. I had no plotstoppers or other annoying bugs whilst playing the entire campaign and the single player scenarios. There have never been any appcrashes ever since patch 1.6 as well. The only bug I encountered was the infamous pre 1.6 bug where a hero could lose its abilities and spells. This bug has been fixed.\n\n\nSo, what can you expect from Heroes VII?\n\nWell, in my opinion, the best mix of Heroes III's and Heroes V's strengths: brilliantly designed single player campaigns and scenarios, everything displayed in beautiful 3D. I like the artdesign.\n\nWhat can't you expect from Heroes VII in its current state?\n\n1) Blizzard Entertainment-like pre-rendered cutscenes or ingame-cutscenes in between campaign missions. Do I miss those? No. This is a game for a relatively small fan base (in comparison to the big fishes out there - this is not Fallout for example) and the developers put their budget where it matters - into the game, not in beautiful rendered videos and eyecandy outside the core game.\n\n2) Well, there is no ingame random-map-generator. You can however generate random maps via the map generator outside of the game and play those once you launch Heroes VII. And the positive side of things is - at least we have a powerful tool to create fan maps. Even steamwork support. Yay!\n\n3) There are no simturns as in Heroes V. If I played the game online, this might change my opinion totally, but I do not care about multiplayer.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThe missions are rich in variety and great fun, the factions are way better designed than in Heroes VI and most importantly: the developers care and constantly improve their game. In February, we will get the first part of the "Lost Tales of Axeoth" - a campaign spanning content that was cut from Heroes IV. Yes, Heroes VII was released way too early and the game reviews crushed the game's reputation. But many bad reviews have been written in the early days after its initial release by fellow gamers who just sneaked into the game for less than two hours, criticized the game, refunded their steam purchase and never looked back (no offense meant though).\n\nIf you expect a great multiplayer game - avoid Heroes VII. Otherwise, it's a great installment and in my opinion the best Heroes since Heroes III (which was buggy as hell in vanilla - but back then in 1999, the internet was no mass phenomenon yet and people did not have the ability to receive worldwide online attention when encountering bugs - times have clearly changed since then).","December 27, 2015","true","122.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

I just write it for the other HOMM fans to prevent tham losing money meaninglessly.\n\nThere are SO MANY things what I'd like to say, but the major truth, why this game is a nightmare and perfectly failed game, are as follows:\n\n1. Broken and messed system\nThe one of the major problem is the system, i.e., hero, skill wheel, town designs. All of those seems creating via copy and paste and even without any deep considerations. This game's genre is Turn-based Strategy Game, but there is actually NO strategy in this version due to the brainlessly designed skill wheel systems and the specialties for heroes. You would not want to keep playing this game more than once in your life.\n\n2. Bugs, bugs, and bugs!\nThere are still huge number of bugs after six patches... So... you even would not be able to imagine how many bugs had been before. Actually, this ♥♥♥♥ game still cannot support multiplayer game since it has been released 6 months ago. Remember that this trash game has been saled in 2016. And they said that there was a technical issues that cause the bugs while playing the multiplayer game... You can easily guess how much poor technical skills the dev team has and so there would be also no hope, I mean, no significant improvements for this game, in the future.\n\n3. 0% of creativity\nThis game totally copied and pasted from the previous versions of HOMM/MMH series. Sounds, Graphics, Icons, whatever. This means their primary object of saling/releasing this game is to make money without any efforts via deceiving the fans of HOMM/MMH series. DO NOT be taken in by their fake advertisements. Again, I'd like to say that this game has no hope, no vision, and no future. There would be no expansions for this game imo since this ♥♥♥♥ has been totally failed.","March 3","false","105.3"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","25","39","0","0"

With the latest patches it runs stable (never had any serious bug), at least in Singleplayer mode (never played Multiplayer, aside from the good old Hotseat).\n\nI like the new overall faction designs (heroes, creatures, buildings, town screens ...), and the visual richness presented on the maps (though some interactive objects are hard to see, unless you use the Alt key to highlight everything). For me this is the best looking 3D Heroes so far, much more iconic than VI was, and not as ugly as Heroes V :)\n\nGameplay is a vast improvement over Heroes VI: Areas of Control are still there, but now connected via caravans (like in Heroes IV), making you less reliant on the horrible act of hero chaining. Skills, abilities and spells were also decluttered: Spells were moved back into the magic guild and shrines (where they belong :), and the skill wheel provides a compact overview when it comes to reviewing and learning passive and active abilities. Actually the whole interface turned out to be really accessible.\n\nThere are also some cool new elements to the game as well: Bridges can now be destroyed, which can be used to secure escape routes and delay enemy attacks. Flanking was added to the combat, giving you at last some idea where to move your units in order to maximize damage, and some means to counter retaliation.\n\nThe campaign is solved way better than in the previous two games: Gone is the forced linear progression from V, and the jumpy, convoluted story of VI. Instead you have six independent campaigns, so you don't need to play the other campaigns to follow the story, and can just start with your favorite faction. Thankfully, the pace of the maps was sped up compared to Heroes VI, so they don't take ages to complete. They are nicely scripted, though the story is nothing to write home about. The overarching story hook with the Council is as silly as its presentation, unfortunately, but overall, I really enjoy the campaign.\n\nAnd the most important part: The good old "Just One More Turn" feeling is definitely there!","January 15","true","13.2"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","0"

The availability of each skill slice being only available to certain types of heroes adds a bit more uniqueness than the the skill tree of HOMM6.  They are still not super diversified, but enough to give the heros a different flavor.  I felt alot of the HOMM6 heroes were carbon copies of each other.\nThe castles and their units are a bit modified as well, though certain staples remain.\nI thought I would find the built-in 'tactics' phase at the beginning of every combat annoying but I kind of like it now.\nI am enjoying the gameplay (almost done playing through the campaigns at the time I type this), the graphics, the music and basically the whole package.\n\nI have been a loyal fan of the HOMM series, since HOMM2, and so far this is one of my favorites!

This game is a huge disappointment.\nJust submitted for a refund on Steam. It's that bad. There is a real trend in the reviews posted on Metacritic so far that its "The best of Heroes 3". Look, I love Heroes 3. It was great. At the time. I still go back and play it every now and then. However, that is not what modern gaming should be compared to. The nostalgia glasses are very thick on this one, and it shows. The interface is very busy and clunky. The animations are clunky. It feels like they ran out of time or something because the opening scenes are mostly static images. The intro to each mission is drawn stills, and that's fine. The problem is the intro to the campaigns and such clearly were meant to be animated.\nThe whole thing just feels so stiff. I think a good comparison would be the controls of X-com the original, VS the new X-com Enemy Unknown. While the controls on the original were fine for the time, they feel clumsy and difficult (to a modern audience), compared to the new one which are smooth and economical. Again, I love the old games, but lets have some progress!\nI'm a 30-something gamer, and have been playing my whole life. I actually enjoyed Heroes 6. Maybe I'm not the right audience for this new one, as I'm not stuck in the past. I hope to revist this entry a year down the road to see if they perhaps patch out some of these issues, but until then I just hope my refund comes in.","September 29, 2015","false","3.8"," 57 of 99 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","57","99","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kunoichiau/recommended/321960/","kunoichiau","kunoichi.au","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kunoichiau/","22 products in account","I cannot recommend this game right now, but everyone is still awaiting the first post-game release patch.\n\nOkay, I've played through the first two Wolf campaigns, and part way through the third. I'll give a quick summation of my thoughts about the game. The game is a vast improvement on Beta 2, but still has a long way to go.\n\nThe AI still has issues (enemies running sideways or backwards for no apparent reason, for example), but I'm sure others are better able to discuss that.\n\nI like the style of the new map (going over and down mountains, for example) and the new additions of seeing other characters get off boats and onto the map (start of second campaign), which gives the map a new and upgraded feel.\n\nHowever, the colouring of the map is still too soft and needs to be saturated with colour, and the objects you can interact with need to stand out more in some way. Sometimes the Alt highlight is blue, sometimes white, but I do find myself having to use it a lot (unlike in previous Heroes games).\n\nLikewise, the battle screens still need work with the graphics (for instance, casting fog on an enemy doesn't surround the enemy in a fog, so you have to right click on them to see if the spell is still working, or try to target them with a shooter). My other half played Heroes 6 while I played Heroes 7, and the general graphics in the battle screen leave a lot to be desired by comparison. I think it's to do with the softer colours, so nothing is particularly well defined, as per the map.\n\nAs for the castle map, ugh! It looks like someone stuck a cartoon painting in the middle of a 3D game, and just doesn't suit the style of the rest of the game. While the colours are brighter, the flatness of the castle screen detracts from the rest of game. It's like different artists worked on the game without a lead designer to ensure that there was a single look and feel to the entire game. It just feels wrong going from such clever 3D (map) to the flat 2D of the castle screen.\n\nAn additional reason why I have such issues with the castle screens is because we were not given what was promised. Take the Sylvan town screen, for example. We voted and chose this image for the screen on the first Sylvan vote: Tree Island[static14.cdn.ubi.com] - note its detail and feel of the image.\n\nThe second castle screen vote was for this image: Harmony in the Moonlight[static14.cdn.ubi.com] - again, note the detail and feel of this image.\n\nI thusly expected an image of similar complexity, with a 3D-ish feel, but a night time version of the first image - expanded, of course, to fit all the buildings.\n\nI feel that the final product - Final Sylvan Townscreen[ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net] - in no way represents the look and feel of what we voted for. Sure, it is a night time town screen with a tree on an island, but it is 'cartoony' in comparison to the original vote, and feels very flat and looks like a watercolour painting rather that something that fits into the rest of this game.\n\nI do feel that Ubisoft falsely advertised Heroes VII, as the original images posted on the website all reflected the original look and feel (eg. Sylvan Faction[mmh7.ubi.com]), not what we got in the final product. There is also no word that these sorts of things will be fixed, or if they will be fixed at all. Very, very disappointing.\n\nSimilarly, the council table is also in need of work. The characters don't move at all, let alone have their mouths moving when they are meant to be talking to each other. Do they have telepathy? Why are they so frozen? It's super creepy, but it could be so cool. This is one of the first things a player sees, so it really reflects badly on the entire game as a result. This isn't the 1990s, where such things were impossible to do!\n\nAs for bugs... Just before the final battle for the first Haven campaign I upgraded 5 chaplains and joined them to a stack of 10 upgraded chaplains making a total of 15. When the other army attacked, I was back to the 5 chaplains and 10 upgraded chaplains, rather than 15 upgraded chaplains. This is certainly a bug that needs investigated.\n\nThe time between the end of the battle and the battle results window was getting longer and longer the more I played the game.\n\nAlso, the game crashed on me quite randomly on the third campaign, whilst on the map page. Because the game takes so long to load, I gave up playing for a while, and am currently playing Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II on the PlayStation, and I have to admit I am enjoying that game much more. (Plus, it actually has animations and cut-scenes, which Heroes VII does not seem to have.)\n\nAnyway, I really hope that these issues are corrected with a patch in the very near future. Currently, whilst far better than Beta 2, the game feels like Beta 3 instead of a final product. More work from the graphics designers is sorely needed to get the game together and working as it should. Right now, the game in no way reflects the advertising pictures throughout this site, which is highly disappointing.","October 12, 2015","false","184.5"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

Fraction abilities no longer require charging for who knows how long. For an instance, elven (Sylvan) fraction ability is pretty potent, and it's what they attempted to achieve in homm5, but failed. Bad thing is it's basically must have for a main hero for most of the fractions (stronghold just doesn't work without it). Some fractions, however, have it considerably weaker. Overall balance is also very questionable.\nFrom updated gameplay perspective it's nothing new really, but offers some smoother experience. If not only...\n\nMajor drawbacks include poor localization, lots of bugs (100+ pages full of complains in 5 days after launch on steam forums), and game being REALLY slow even on somewhat decent pc for no apparent reason. All the Ubisoft things. So, nothing really new and tons of crappy game support.\n\nBottom line: Don't pay for this game now unless you're a fan of the series, it's totally not worth it.

Battling the enemy heroes and conquering their towns provides very little satisfaction as a result because there was never really any threat of them managing to repel your attacks because as I say the AI seems to be very stupid, using nothing in way of tactics to defeat you and their armies are never really that threatening in the first place. I have noticed that half the time they seem to have caravans full of creatures all gathered in one place at their base and you simply have to walk up and defeat them one by one. The enemy towns never seem to be built up either and the enemy spread their troops amongst five or six heroes so none of them pose a threat. I've been a fan of the heroes of might and magic games for a long time now but this one is, whilst graphically very nice looking, probably the most boring of the lot to play. At least in heroes 6 managing to complete a level felt like a challenge, whereas here the feeling is just meh. I can't even be bothered to explore that much and collect resources etc. or even level up my hero because the levelling up will happen very quickly and there is always a max level that is achieved very early on in each level. All you have to do is just gather the bare minimum of troops and walk over to where the enemy are and you win every time.

A lot of the elements, menu and gameplay, feel a bit archaic. When starting the campaign I was really sceptical because of the menu and the presentation of the story, but after meeting my first hero, improving my first city and fighting my first enemies, it felt like playing good old Heroes II again. The story in the campaign is well told and makes it very addictive.\nOn the downside without the story the game mechanics doesn't feel that up-to-date, I remember Heroes II very fondly and like that Heroes VII feels a lot alike, but it inherited as well a lot of it's flaws: the fight feel a bit too simplistic and while exploring the map and fighting your way through hordes of monsters is fun to some extend, it's a bit too repetitive for my taste etc. And the multiplayer experience seems to not have evolved since I played in hotseat mode in Heroes II.\nHowever, if it comes to the question whether I enjoyed playing Heroes, the answer is a clear "yes". :)\nPS: I have read a lot about bugs.

The problem is that it is also very clearly unfinished.\n\nUnits look good, but everything else, both models and textures, looks blatantly unfinished. Adventure map models are constantly clipping through and rendering inside walls - having a city stuck halfway through a transparent mountain gets confusing, and happens regularly. The font used to display effects like the Sylvan mark ability is just... cheap-looking. Barely a step up from unfiltered comic sans. I wouldn't bring this up, but it just looks jarringly unprofessional.\n\nEverything does. I haven't played campaign mode, so I can't talk about the cinematics as so many others do, but it wouldn't surprise me to hear that they are as cheap and abysmal-looking as they've been made out to be.\n\nAnd that's without getting into the bugs. One of the more common ones is having the text appear outside of a window, or having notifications on one window overlap one another so that you can't read them. There are also animations that simply don't play; sometimes, dead units will simply freeze rather than playing their death animation. Sometimes they just vanish from the battlefield entirely. Sometimes LIVING units vanish from the battlefield entirely, particularly when you have large units near terrain. And, most notably, the game I was just playing had a two-fer glitch that rendered it essentially unplayable and literally unwinnable; not only did all ranged units suddenly lose their ability to make ranged attacks, but cities became uncapturable. Killing all units defending the city would result in the screen "shimmering" for a moment, the city failing to change sides, and all units re-appearing. Infinitely. I did this six times over three different cities.\n\nSo the bugs and unfinished-looking graphics are a downside (music tends to cut in and out quite often, too, but that's less noticeable). I would recommend holding off until they're fixed, assuming that they ever are.\n\nIf you're not concerned about the bugs, though, the core game is actually not bad. Not having Inferno as a playable faction is rather disappointing, but the rest of it is the same Heroes game that we've loved for a long time. The return of the 2D city screens is actually quite nice, and they all look pretty cool. The unit designs are all very neat-looking, and the shift from unit tiers to Core-Elite-Champion is actually handled very well (and doesn't change so much that purists will be offended). Every faction is extremely unique and distinct, and from what I can tell, they're all pretty much equally viable.\n\nThe biggest complaint I can really make against the actual core game is the lack of content. The number of maps is fairly small (though the editor helps) and there aren't many unique artifacts (the editor helps less with this). And I still don't know why they changed the resource names (especially because they all look the same on the map now). But if you can look past that, the new skill wheel is quite nice, the addition of flanking adds a new tactical level to battles, and basically it's everything you'd expect from a Heroes game.","October 6, 2015","false","29.9"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

In every Game for me WORKING Multiplayer is a MUST.  Because after I played a time against the AI, which is by the way shocking stupid in heroes 7, i get bored. No new strategy, no human thinking i'll never play a strategy game against an AI for long.\n\nEvery Heroes i played from Heroes 3 (i played heroes 2 Multi too but only Hotseat) had a working multiplayer.\n\nAnd at the top of that if you made a savegame, at a point where the Game was not OUT OF SNYC, well that was useless. Because the Game CORRUPTED the SAVEGAMES from before as well.\n\nI NEVER encountered a game in the HISTORY of GAMEPLAY that allowed the program to TOUCH AND CHANGE your SAVEGAMES. Because a SVEGAME IS SUPPOUSED TO BE SAAVVEE!\n\nI Buyed the Geme for me and my girlfriend and and was looking forward to the release. I rusheed home from work after i started downloading the game before work and started playing. And what a dissapointment. After 4 hours of screwing around I came to the conclusion that the game was not playable in multiplayer.\n\nThey announced a big patch and after the patch release (over 1.5 GB) i hoped they fixed it but it still didn't work.\n\n\nOne more Thing: the convertion of Cities that worked perfectly in heroes 6 was not implimented in heroes 7.\n\nNow let me tell you one thing, fans of cities non convertable:\nIf you ar playing Academy and your Human opponent plays Sylvanas. You conquer 2 Cities one is Dungeon and one is Nekromacer.\n\nYour Opponent conquers the other 2 and both are sylvanas. He stack all his creatures and you don't. How can you still win that game when your human opponent has 3 times the ammount of creaturens on a stack??? At least it should be an option at map settings before you start, so if anybody doesn't like that, it can be disabled.\n\nConverting Cities was Progress. And they removed it and replaced it throug errors out of sync and by the way where are the dwarfs, my favorite from Heroes 5. Of course it just happened there were no programmers left to work on them, they were too busy programming errors and removing progress.\n\nI would like to say that i never was that dissiapointed by a game. But honestly i have to admitt i was: Rome 2 total war was quite the same dissapointment.","November 19, 2015","false","113.1"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","0"

I haven't played any skirmish maps or even multiplayer maps.)\n\nGenerally you will like this game if you like its predecessors. The main concepts stay the same with very little changes.\nAs I like these concepts and as I think everybody who's interested in this game knows them as well, I just point out what I didn't like about the game:\n\nAll in all it was a little too easy. While I have played most of the HoMM games and other TBS (e. g. Age of Wonders), I wouldn't claim myself to be an expert. I played on normal difficulty and just followed the general strategy of focussing on leveling up a single hero on each map fighting with him only, until the level cap is reached. Then I would level up the next hero. And before finishing a map, I always tried to visit every building that increases stats with each hero.\nDuring all of the campaign, I had 2-3 tough battles. The rest was quite easy.\n\nSomehow the battles got repetitive quickly. I don't know if there are more neutral enemy armies in this game than in its predecessors or if the tactial possibilities are more limited but I often had a couple of battles in a row that played completely the same. That most likely is connected to the game being too easy.\n\nThat may as well be connected to the spell "Summon Elementals" being too powerful. If you have this spell with a decent mage, you'll blast all enemy armies especially in the beginning of a map when they're still small.\n\nThe wizards campaign starts with a beautiful map with two memorable heroes. Unfortunatley the next two maps are played with different heroes that are only loosely conncted. While the stories where nice as well (Arabian Nights atmosphere) I would have liked it much better if you more or less played with the same heroes through the campaign.\n\nWhen one of your buildings gets attacked with no hero defending it, you can't do a quick battle or surrender in the tactical combat map. You're forced to (auto)play the battle. That's unnerving when you'll loose the battle anyway.\n\nI played through the campaign with version 1.6. While there were some minor bugs, there was only one really unnerving one: artefact exchang on heroes is totally bugged, making it impossible to distribute artefacts as you wish. You may even loose items permanently. That a bug like this slipped QA is pathetic. I more than once considered stopping and uninstalling the game because of this.\nOn my personal fun scale, I gave it a 7,5/10, so for me it wasn't as good as Age of Wonders III (8/10).","February 15","true","186.3"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","20","32","0","0"

I really hope it gets patched heavily, because there are three major issues that need fixing right now :\n\n- Unplayable multiplayer : tried to play with a friend in co-op, took ages in order to even get in a game together (port opening, static IP setup... really ?), and then out-of-sync error spam for like 20 turns starting at turn 5ish, until my friend gets stuck in a previous turn and can't play anymore because well... it's actually gone out of sync.\n\n- No RMG outside of the editor ? If I want to play with a friend, I have to select one of very few predefined maps that support more than 2 players. I just want to select the number of players, a few variables, and have a randomly generated map to play on against some AIs, is that too much to ask ? It's that simple in Age of Wonders III.\n\n- No spectator mode for your ally's battles ? All my friend got to do while I was playing my battle was watch a map, a progress bar, and listen to the sounds of the battle being played. Wow. Then again, in Age of Wonders III you have to watch battles that are being played. It gets dull to sit there watching other players do their things... but at least you have something more entertaining to watch than a noisy loading screen for f*ck's sake.\n\nOther than that I have no real complaints about the game. It's got a nice style, and to me the graphics are fine and the animations are decent enough. It also runs fine on my rig (Hopefully - i7 5820k, GTX980, 16gigs DDR4 and a SSD).

That played out well for me as it released in the fashion I have come to expect from them. By all accounts the game was heinous and unplayable. So I ignored it. Until I started to see positive reviews float from the depths, mentioning patch 1.6 as finally releasing a finished, playable and enjoyable game. I dared not to hope... But it was also on steam sale... I took the plunge.....\n\nAnd sunk into the warm, comforting bath water of a heroes of might magic game. 7 sees the return of resources and spells and mage guilds, but keeps the area control around towns. The skill dots of 6 also forgotten, now having a wheel where you can take various skills to grand mastery, mastery, expert or novice depending on your class, of which each faction has 6. Before you get overwhelmed with choice note that 6 are the same for every faction, 3 might and 3 magic with an agressive, defensive and balanced version of each. You can plan ahead, make very different heroes with different playstyles on every map... A great experience.\n\nThe game is ready to be played, it is fun, it is worthy of it's lineage.\n\nMaybe next time Ubi wont fart out a half cooked game?

As an aside, who are these endless strangers that keep making friend requests?  Why?  And why does it have to pop up in the middle of my game?\n\nOK, with those two provisos, I was pleasantly surprised.  This game seems to take Heroes back to its roots.  Balance is better.  There are tactical choices in how you compose your army.  It looks great.  Campaign design is better -- not endlessly fighting the same stacks over and over.  Storytelling isn't awesome but is much improved.\n\nHere is hoping this paves the way for a return of the franchise, hopefully sold to someone other than Ubisoft.","December 30, 2015","true","7.2"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

So HoMM5 was stuck between the old style and a new direction.\n\nSo this game the dev crushed his soul and just made a "Heroes of M&M" game.

They are not met.\n\nDon't misunderstand me, the game isn't that bad, but it's not that good either.\nFirst of all, this is not Heroes of Might & Magic. It is Heroes of MIGHT & magic. Magic is not very useful, except at the game beginning where it decides the battle. Once you reach mid-game, your best spells are these that alter inititiave or movement, the spell that conjures elemental and a few troop enhancing spells. Anything else is mostly useless. And unlike other editions (I did not play 6 however), I have never been mana starved.\n\nCombat is too deadly, and hardly lasts more than 3 rounds. Usually, it is over at the end of the first or somewhere during the second round. This explains in part why magic is no that important: you cast one, at most two spells in one combat!\n\nThe game is unstable and may crash. I have identified an artifact that causes the game to crash as soon as I enter combat. Too bad, it was a good one! Since you have autosave at the end of every turn, you can live with such bugs.\n\nMuch can also be said about heroes skills. Some are very poor, such as the exploration tree (1 skill point for 1 movement point is a poor trade off!), and some are just too good to pass over (the parangon tree if you get it.) Since you have only 30 levels, you will very often end up with the same skills. Too bad.\n\nI've yet to finish the campaign. It was not too bad, until I got stuck in the land of dreams (mage campaign); I'm possibly too dumb, but moving around doesn't open the next passage at some point. So that finishes this campaign. But it looks like a bug. (Edit: I restarted from before entering the land of dreams and it did work.)\n\nAlso, I'm still missing Heroes 3 graphics. They were clear and looked like fairy land. These graphics are 3D (yeah, that's trendy!), but the game doesn't need that and it tends to obscure places in the land; you don't know if you can pass through or if there is a treasure etc... until you try. And in many cases, you have a hard time distinguishing a pile of material or an important land marker from the surroundings.\n\nOverall the game is not unpleasant.\nIt's just not great, with many little things that should have been seen and corrected.\n\nEdit: One more reason to be warry; today, I discovered that my most recent saves are bugged, and loading the last uncorrupted one makes me lose 2h of game. Or so I thought. This happened again after this, so I'll have to end the campaign crippled or run around the map losing time to recover my spells. Amusingly, my skills are scrambled too: some are lost... nothing to do about that! This latest discovery doesn't plead in favor of the game!\n\nEdit2: This last bug is getting more and more ennoying and it cripples about one game out of three. I'd recommend not to buy the game as long as it is not solved: regularly having to reload old saves, having to make check points (which you load to know if the save is correct) is just plain unacceptable and removes much of the game fun. Many other less apparent bugs spoil the game; for example, I noticed that mage's towers don't shoot when sieged; necromancers get so many skelettons from the middle of the game that it looks like a bug; I could name others... Clearly, even though the game will let you get some good time if you like the genre, the editor definitely doesn't respect the customer. And aout the editor, I did not mention that you will have Uplay running in the background, and unlike Steam, it is a pile of s..t; it may send you pop ups every thirty seconds should you lose your internet connection, and it may even crash your game...","November 18, 2015","false","283.4"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","17","27","0","0"

That it would grow from maybe a rather childish position, to a mature, sophisticated, excelent masterpiece. This is, of course, not entirely possible, since, I presume that certain types of games are always being produced for the same target age group of players. So I am allways a little disapointed when a new version doesn't meet my always increasing expectations. Anyways, I am sorry to say, that in the case of Might & Magic Heroes VII, my disappointment has more severe reasons.\n\nBased on what has been presented for many months on the products home page (mmh7.ubi.com), I expected monumental visual experience and immersive, exciting gameplay.\n\nInstead, the graphics of the game is many levels behind beautiful visual style and artworks presented on the homepage, obsolete by any standards, cheap and, in some parts, utterly unprofessional and shoddy. If the UI of the game was only by half as beautifull as is the web page, the day would be saved.\n\nCheap icons, which, somehow, do not fit the background. Uggly fonts with heavy drop shadows. Inconsistent color combinations. And, after all, that windowy user interface with a lot of old days buttons and scroll bars. All that brings the feeling of refusal and suffocation.\n\nGameplay is tedious and, in comparison with the previous version (Might and Magic: Heroes 6) doesn't bring any added value or refreshing novelty. Game as a whole is, dare I say, a very telling evidence of underbudget or mismanaged development project, especially when you see quite a good conceptual art.\n\nFrom reasons mentioned, the game is simply not worth of money I spent on it.

In the beginning the game was total disaster but after 1.3 patch it was more or less playable (I'm playing multiplayer only).\n\nNow after 1.6 Ubisoft didn't change much from point of view of plenty of bugs and game balance - a total disaster.\n\nJust few examples about balance.\n\nWhole name of game is wrong. It should be something like: Magic and a bit of Might. Magic is just very much overpowered. For instance with well upgraded water magic or with elementals calling you can beat almost any neutrals without losses in your army.\n\nThe most overpowered fraction in Stronghold clearly. First of all they have 50% defence from magic (the only fraction has it). Second and even more important that upgraded Gnolls (around 100 units) and Harpies 6x1 can beat a very strong neutrals easily (even in deadly level sometimes). For some reason they are very cheap as well. Comparing to Dungeon for instance where first 3 levels of creatures are clearly worse.\n\nI wrote a report about another bug 23.12 but still no answer. Got just automatic message that they would reply within 48 hours.\n\nHeroes M&M - my favourite game since childhood. But I'm not satisfied with Ubisoft job at all. Looks like they decided to bury this game.","January 2","false","332.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

It does however have a lot of unit and creature variety, and enough differing map monsters that there are a variety of fights to be had which offer many unique battles and cool unit abilities/specializations that add some depth to the tactics.\n\nSpells seem OP, but hey, they always were (blind I'm looking at you).  This is def. better than H6, and the levelling up system is improved.\n\nNote that so far I have played only the single player campaign, and have no interest in multiplayer, nor have I tried it.  It may or may not work, I don't know, but as far as all other reported glitches/problems/crashes reported, so far I have not experienced any of that, so that is good, and their latest patch does seem to have fixed a lot of the reported problems.\n\nThe cinematics sucks, the story is so-so, but as long as you know that going into it you won't be disappointed.  Playing the game is what's fun.  I would love many more map options for single player scenario, as that is what kept me playing H3 for years and years (and still to this day), there are only a few choices at the current time, which kinda blows.  But the campaign offers a long enough game play experience to make this worth it, especially when it's on sale anyway.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of the series, start with H3 as it's cheaper, and ultimately still the better game, and decide if you like this style of game before going for the full pop of this title.","December 7, 2015","true","5.7"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","26","45","0","0"

I was initially put off by the negative reviews, but as they were mostly due to bugs related to the initial releaser, I waited a few months before purchasing.\n\nThis is my initial experience:\nMy experience with patch 1.6 has not seen the recurrent crashes and game ending bugs. I am almost done with the first campaign and the game has been stable. There are a few improvements over the past iteration, such as being able to easily set up caravans to ferry troops from one city to another, as well as a well thought out ability tree - at least for the Haven general abilities. Haven't had much opportunity to use spells, but I'm having a blast of a time.\n\nAll I can say is that if you have been putting off getting HOMM7 because of the bugs, I think this is not a bad time to get in. I would positively recommend this game if you love any of the previous HOMM iterations. It is feeling better than HOMM4, slightly less engaging than 5, and I prefer the graphics over 6, even though the lips don't move! (I think if they were going to use their 3D models in static positions, I would have preferred 2D art during the cut scenes).\n\nAll in all a fun game in the vein of previous HOMM.","December 24, 2015","true","53.4"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogresav/recommended/321960/","ogresav","ogresav","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogresav/","465 products in account","Update:\n\nI updated to Windows 10, considering that maybe they tested more on a newer OS (I was on 7, still hits minimum reqs), and maybe I was right!\n\nThe game is running fine for me now, except for one crash and one bug on a map, but this is all before the update that was just released today, 10/14/2015. I've been playing 8 player FFA singleplayer (my favorite way to play Heroes), and I've had a great time.\n\nOverall, I think they took great parts of previous releases and put them together in a clean way.\n\nMagic: They went back to the style from HoMM3 where you upgrade your mage guild and get a new set of spells. Plus, you can select your desired sphere of magic, and it'll ensure you get at least one spell of that per level. Also, each faction has its own specialization that you will always get, and one that you will never get. For example, Haven always gets one Light spell, and never gets Dark, and on top of this you choose the other type you always want to get. I think this is the best magic system I've seen in HoMM so far, from playing 3, 5, 6, and now 7.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are not so much noticeably better than 6, but they are better. In some ways you can really tell, but either way, they're up to date for 2015.\n\nTowns: town building feels like HoMM3 and I really enjoy the style of the towns so far. You have a good set of options early on for what you want to build, and there are hard decisions to make, like when you should save up for more expensive buildings, or just buy extra units and go fight battles. For several buildings, you have two options (+X harpies or +X gnolls?), and for your core 7 creature, you have two different versions. This is a really strong aspect of this release. For example, Dungeon has the Cave Hydra or the Shadow Dragon, and each have their own upgraded version. It's a fun feature.\n\nAlso, the caravans are a great feature, as well as some spells that you may have which allow you to summon units from your town to your hero (a dark spell, maybe some others).\n\nHeroes: The heroes level up and have skill points you can drop into different areas, and 3 "ultimate" skills, one unique per faction. This has been really fun so far. I've had a Stronghold hero that did massive damage after fully upgrading the special stronghold "Bloodrage" skill set, and I've had Dungeon creatures that can walk through enemies, flank them from the rear and attack twice, without retaliation! It sounds unfair, but this is very late game, and it takes a while to build your hero to the level where they can do this. Either way, the game just came out and balancing will take time.\n\nBattles: One thing that I think is a huge step ahead: flanking! If you attack from the sides you do extra damage, and from the rear you do a good percent more. Upgrades can make this even more damaging. You will have to think hard about placement so that you can flank someone with the right creature and do massive damage, also possibly having special abilities that are faction specific that work when you flank from the rear.\n\nThe Bad: As for steps back, inferno isn't here! I'm betting it's coming in DLC, but that was a core faction that we all loved.\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend the game as the next in the series, and it looks like it'll be up there with 5 and 3 for me. It was a really sloppy release, but they have probably worked their asses off to get the patch out the door two weeks later. I've been fine in windows 10 so far, but with 7, it wouldn't even run, at least before the patch.\n\nCheers!\n\nPrevious review: This game crashes a ridiculous amount. I can't run the default 64 bit binary or it'll just crash before even showing the splash screen. If I run the 32 bit one, I can get started to play, but usually it'll just crash before the game loads.\n\nI've only managed to get a decent 1v1 game going with an AI, and it crashed when I was winning and attacked their castle. I just tried to do 2v2 hotseat with a friend and 2 AIs, and it crashed before the game loaded. Twice, different maps.\n\nI was so excited for this game, but sadly, it's broken. Wait until they actually finish the game before considering purchasing.\n\nIf they don't fix this, this is the end of the HoMM story for me. I'm certainly not pre-ordering the next one. I thought I'd at least get to play a buggy game, but no, if I'm lucky I get a splash screen.","October 10, 2015","true","33.3"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","32","57","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TalismanDota/recommended/321960/","TalismanDota","Talisman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TalismanDota/","195 products in account","TL,DR: I like this game a lot, but it is very buggy. Many users have reported issues with crashing (I have not experienced any crashes), multiplayer does not work (desynchs), and most importantly (in my opinion) units do not behave correctly on the tactical map. This is pretty standard stuff for a Ubisoft game, so unless you are a big Heroes of Might and Magic fan, like me, then you should hold off on buying the game.\n\n------\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised with how much I'm enjoying the game. I've sunk a ridiculous amount of time into every heroes entry since 3 (yes, even 6--I ♥♥♥♥ you not, I played it for over 250 hours). Fortunately, they have outright removed all of the awfulness from 6.\n\nHero leveling is fairly interesting. The schools of magic seem reasonably distinct and useful. I have an inkling that Prime might be a bit OP (seriously, the perk for teleport, +50 initiative, is very, very powerful, and time control, for its cost, is super useful). UPDATE: Light magic is also overpowerd. Dear God retribution is absurd. If ALL of the schools are overpowerd, then I'm totally behind that design... but I feel like fire, water, and earth are probably lagging behind. We'll see.\n\nThey have massively reduced the ease of resurrecting units, to the point where you have to specialize pretty hard to be able to do it, which I think is appropriate.\n\nThere seems to be a good number of items. Not like heroes III, but respectable. Set bonuses can be very nice, and on larger maps where you get more items, mixing and matches these bonuses is good fun.\n\nFactions are nice and distinct. Each has its own style of play, and they seem to be balanced by each being unbalanced, which I prefer.\n\nCreatures are, for the most part, pretty good. There are some that I dislike for various reasons, such as pixies and dryads being way too similar in appearance, and others which seem either under-powered, or too difficult to reach critical mass (as in, they keep dying off in combats because the AI will prioritize targeting them). Some examples of these include blade-dancers (very low HP for an elite unit, melee, low growth, expensive creature building), vampires (melee, low growth, bugged--will come to that in a bit), lamasus, etc. I think a balance pass will fix most of these issues.\n\nTown development is interesting and full of meaningful choices. Do you squeeze out a creature building before the end of the week, or are you fiscally responsible and prioritize getting your town hall up ASAP? It takes a lot of time and adventuring to obtain the resources to max out your town, especially since you'll also be recruiting creatures and a hero or two.\n\nWalls now come with a garrison, which can't be removed, and defend towns from those pesky 1 creature hero armies. Forts, and gates also come with garrisons, which fill over time for free, allowing some meaningful zones of control.\n\nCaravans are back! In IV, you could order a caravan, and it would magically appear after a set period of time. In VII, caravans are an actual unit on the map, with a high move speed, that can be interacted with by your heroes and by the enemy, so they can be somewhat risky if your territories aren't secured.\n\nFinally, let's go ahead and mention that this game is buggy as all hell. I personally have not experienced any crashes, freezes, or issues with the SP campaign. I HAVE, however, noticed a lot of incorrect unit behavior in battles. Do not take any perks relating to your warfare units right now, because they are very glitchy, and perks seem to make it worse. I've noticed gnoll hunters don't always do what they're supposed to, the treant's abilities don't seem to work at all, and effects that trigger on damage/unit kills will not trigger on the battle-ending attack (so vampires don't lifesteal if they end the battle by killing something, and Djinn won't provide mana to your hero). Units sometimes also get really excited and decide to ignore their move speed, allowing them to cover the entire tactical map. Similarly, heroes will sometimes get a second wind on the campaign map for no discernible reason. Also, the AI is just terrible, both tactically and strategically.\n\nSo why the hell am I enjoying this game? Because it's a ♥♥♥♥ing Heroes of Might and Magic game, and it's got a lot of potential, and it's actually a well designed game. Also the music is quite nice.","October 2, 2015","false","33.5"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

The game does not to a good job of alerting you to new items that appear. I got completely stuck in one scenario because I hadn't noticed a huge stack of free creatures had appeared along with a portal to the scenario-winning battle.\n\nIn short, this is a good classic Heroes game that can only get better with a patch or two.","October 7, 2015","true","25.5"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","30","56","3","0"

To me, VI was a huge disappointment mainly becasue I play the game for the story. I believe I am not alone when I say that I do not have the time what it takes to finish a scenario on super hard mode and often go for easier settings. Heroes VI was so badly balanced that adventuros players like me had no chance finishing a campaign without denying their nature and focusing only on the objective. Enough said, I still have 100+ hours played.\n\nNow back to Heroes VII, I have been really looking forward to this game, however the bad reviews and the price tag put me off. As a real fan I could not be satisfied with this and decided to wait for the christmas period - honestly, I knew that because of all the bad reviews the game would not cost more than £20 - and I was right.\n\nSo here I was, after a long time of waiting I finally got to try out the game. I was expecting clunky gameplay with tons of bugs, however what I saw was a whole lot better than what I expected.\nUnlike other people reviewing this game, I started on patch 1.6 that may make a huge difference (perhaps).\nSo here is what I found so far after finishing the first heaven campaign and being at 4/5 in the necromancer campaign:\n\n\nNegative (ish)/Could be better:\n- Cutscene animation - frozen characters. Annoying, but can live with it. Doesn't change my impression of the story at all.\n- Clunky movement - yes, it is true that often you stop your hero with using too many or too few clicks. Can live with it.\n- Clunky targeting - Often by reselecting a target if you do not click on the rigth side of it then your character may chose a longer route to it and you end up losing movement points. To me this was the most annoying, but can get used to it.\n- Not being able to replay cutscenes - This may be a user error but I missed the finishing cutscene of the heaven campaign and found no way of replaying it. Thankfully youtube had all the videos I needed. Just to clarify I did try to re-finish the campaign from a save but the council hall cutscene did not replay.\n- No inferno faction - Perhaps we will have this later, cleary the creatures are there and you definitely got to see at least one inferno hero, perhaps just need to be unlocked?\n- Lack of animation - Becasue I like to see my awesome creatures when I hire them there and then without any extra clicks. Not a tragedy, just would be nice.\n\nPositive\n- Good story - yes, I read the reviews of the story not being good enough but so far I am quite amased and all I can say that perhaps people haven't quite managed to grasp idea of the story so far. Truth is that HOMM V had an awesome story and it is very hard to match this. All in all, this is different but so far I am quite happy with it.\n- Balanced difficulty levels - Will not take days and weeks to finish a campaign. I love this. Easy should be easy. If you want harder play on hard...\n\n\nAll in all, I am glad that I did not let the bad reviews stop me from buying this game. so far I have not seen any bugs and while I agree that it should not be in the £40+ price tag it is an enjoyable game and would recommend to all true fans of the Heroes series. I am really looking forward to explore all the different factions and abilities, perhaps I will write a more in depth review once I have done this. Until then, HAVE FUN!\n","January 1","true","24.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

I feel they really made some good choices with a 3 style combat/hero system combined with caravans. The only reason this game is not doing well seems to be failures on the technical side which is a shame... The tech side is suppose to be the easy part. I really think they over did the graphics for a turn based game. Just make them crisp and fast. Would like a new caravan graphic that actually looks like a caravan and not just a hero's horse. The ledges don't have to be so steep with such crazy camera angles. Also story line seems to be lacking originality, everytime I read a different factions storyline I'm reminded of some mainstream movie or book series from the last 20 years. Still think the creatures and towns in 3 are cooler; really not a fan of the sylvan theme. They should think about marketing this series towards tablets. I can't think of any reason why this wouldn't make a great tablet game if done correctly. Plus the graphics level and player expectations would be more on point for the series.\n\n+ Hero's act seperate from creature stacks as in H3.\n+ Siege and other support devices like in H3 but more unique; better than H3.\n+ Castles have towers and more; better than H3.\n+ Creatures need hero to travel but hero no longer needs at least 1 creature; better than H3.\n+ Graphics are the best of any Heros.\n+ Long campain with depth.\n+ Retained Hotseat.\n+ Caravans and Forts included.\n\n- Graphics, battle scense, and inventory are glitchy.\n- Caravans look like a horse; could be more unique.\n- Campain characters faces don't move when talking (little creepy).\n- Story is not original.\n- Faction names and creature choices are a little lame. Factions not as cool as Hero's 3 or even 2 for that matter.\n\n\nI'm still feeling out the talents and magic tree.

The intro is great, but the game itself is awful. On the one hand the graphics are so hard on my laptop that it takes forever to even load up the main menu. To so much as get one hero to move once takes half a dozen attempts due to some pathfinding problem.\n\nOn the other the graphics don't even look good. They look like an attempt at a painting by someone who has only ever done technical drawing. When you clicked on a town or city in any other HOMM game you got an impressive, atmospheric feel like you were actually inside a fantastical settlement. The music, the individual buildings, in each different type of settlement added to the atmosphere, which was very different for each faction. Heroes VII could be any other computer game out there. Just a set of flow charts and boxes with some half-hearted graphics added. The campaign map and the battle map heroes and terrain may be 3-D, but they look hollow and empty - and downright weird.\n\nIt's like whoever made the game had a Heroes of Might and Magic game described to them but had never actually seen one - kind of like a medieval European drawing of an elephant by someone who'd never seen one but only heard one described. I get the feeling the designers were given a contract to make a Might and Magic game and then were whispering to one another "but what is a Heroes of Might and Magic?".\n\nI thought maybe it was just the campaign that was the problem, so i went back to it and started it up again and tried a scenario. No, it's the entire game. I'd love to be able to love this game. I don't mind changes when they're improvements - despite some people panning Heroes VI i loved it. Yes, having to sign up to uplay to install and play it was a bit annoying at first, but it was still a great game that kept the best of the series and added improvements. And you can actually set Heroes VI and uplay to run in offline mode. But Heroes VII? I can barely even look at the thing.\n\nHeroes VI does (eventually, and very slowly) run on my laptop- the patches seem to have sorted a lot of the initial problems - but it's just unbearable to even look at it,\n","October 27, 2015","false","1.0"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Story and aethetic wise, I'm afraid that the dev tried too hard to fit things in the "plotline", if there was any, to match the game story and the art style with its predecessors; unfortunately I see little connection between 7 and the 2 previous titles, and the game completely lost touch with its former style (just look at the Necropolis town in this game).\n\nI was glad to see the dev team had an interactive design process with the fans, however I fear that they merely heard the feedback, but did not listen. I waited for many patches, and only bought it when on sale, yet I was disappointed. Many players complained about how bad HOMM 4 was, but IMHO HOMM 7 would be the lowest HOMM series has reached so far.","February 8","false","0.8"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

This game is soooooooo scaled down version of previous Heroes game. This game feels rushed and incomplete.\n\nWhere do i start:\n\n1. The intro is not even properly done, its like pictures and you hear voices, no movements, no mouths that move when speaking, if you compare this to Heroes VI, i mean really, how could they drop the standards so much, they just wanted to rake in the money and not really put in much of an effort making this game.\n\n2. Lots of things missing in the game and in game buttons, menu etc that was in previous game.\n\n3. Graphics looks crap and i still say Heroes VI was better, even the combat looked better in Heroes VI, again scaled down quick buck rushed version this new Heroes VII.\n\n4. Things i miss in combat (i cannot find this and might have missed it), this is small example but it made Heroes VI so much better than this game, example: When troops died in combat, you could check the stack and see how many died so that if you want to use resurrect spell you could check which stack of troops would benefit it the most if you lost troops from more than one stack, this is COMPLETELY GONE, no way to check what stack qty was so no idea which stack lost troops unless you keep track of this in your brain. WHY WHY remove that. It was very helpfull info during combat.\n\n5. City view looks crap, like animation type picture, not even close to how nice Heroes VI was.\n\n6. City building: A real stupid building tree and if you build one choice you cannot build the other choice. Confusing as well.\n\n7. Spells, no proper tree to know what field of magic you want to go into, no way to check spells etc, so you have to choose blind between Air, Fire, Water etc. magic schools and not really know what spells you could cast. Also the spells are very limited.\n\n8. Again info and tool tips not informative enough or non existant.\n\n9. Skirmish maps, i saw like 8 maps, WOW i can really enjoy myself a lot (this is sarcasm). Then there is scenario maps but you limited in choice because of being a scenario, like who you play as, victory conditions etc.\n\n10. Game rushes you once again, this has been a problem with all Heroes games and i really thought that they would listen to their clients because there has been loads complaining about this since game 1. You still have to rush and get everything as fast as possible, you also have to attack AI so quickly otherwise he will have 3 times more troops than you.\nExample: Played 2 player skirmish, found AI Hero, had 3, 1 had the most of his troops, destroyed all 3 heroes, checked his only city, had like 40 troops between 4 stacks in defence, left AI to get the other goodies i had to leave because YOUR ALWAYS RUSHED IN THIS GAME, like 20 turns later, AI comes with his hero again, guess what, almost double the troops i have...NOW WHERE DID ALL THOSE TROOPS COME FROM, i destroyed everything, so even with my 20 turns later of adding more troops to my existing troops, the AI has more troops than me out of the BLUE!!???? So the cheating still in game, even on Easy difficulty.\n\n11. This game feels like it was made with someone sitting in his garage and making his first game. This from people who brought out 6 titles before this crap game. This was rushed and NOT complete and then still want to sell it at such a HIGH price. Not worth the $50 or $60 (deluxe) price for this game. Should have been around $20-$30 price tag.\n\nStay away from this game because you will REGRET buying this SCALED DOWN QUICK BUCK RUSHED EXCUSE ME of a  version of this new Heroes VII.

I liked literally every single HoMM game, all the way up to 6 and including its misbegotten child, 4. HoMM7, however, deserves no love.\n\n\nIt is, at best, an unfinished project.\nAt worst, a mockery of all that Might & Magic stands for.\n\nThe animations and sound are worse than they were in V. The creature sounds in particular are even more sloppily done than before - it seems they let an intern play around with a soundboard from HoMM2 and applied a filter over it.\n\nThe gameplay itself tries to return to the HoMM1/2/3 roots while retaining most of the mechanics from V and VI, both the good ones and the clunky ones - the result is something that has absolutely no synergy and is generally just confusing.\n\nThe creature/faction balance is good, however. The addition of flanking adds a new depth to the battles, which make them as fun as we're used to. It is, unfortunately, a pearl floating on a pigsty. A very large pigsty.\n\nThe game itself is pretty, but things get very weird and jarring - the 'cutscenes' are a horrible mess of 3d characters that don't even get to have animations, the soundtrack is mostly HoMM VI's almost track-by-track.\n\nIn short: the game brings nothing new to the table and only serves as a disappointment. Pick it up on 50% sale or more. At full price, it's a mockery. Just get VI or V - VII is a rushed, unfinished project that is barely fit for an open beta, let alone a 50€ release.\n\n5/10.

Don't let the average positive review score scare you off, as it seems the majority of the issues are squashed.\n\nI will hold my full review until I have spent more time with the game.\n\nFor now, I will say that is stable enough to trust and enjoy.  Heroes VII has gotten away from negative changes to the forumula from VI, brought back older and better mechanics, while still adding enough for a fresh experience. There are some truely smart changes.\n\nThe unanimated cutscenes, while at face value seem unpolished and cheap, allow for longer and less rushed dialogue between main characters that would otherwise be too expensive to justify when fully animated. I think it's an interesting and fair trade off, one that I wouldnt mind seeing other games adopt.\n\nOverall, the graphics are not to a modern standard. Chances are, as a HOMM fan, you are OK with this. There are some improvements over HOMM VI, but this can be almost impossible to distinguish most of the time. However, at times, there are some truely nice looking environments that will surprise you.\n\nWhile too early to tell, this game is on track to being my second favourite HOMM game to date.\n\nTL;DR, The game is now playable and worth your attention, don't wait for a sale.","October 14, 2015","true","35.6"," 31 of 60 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","31","60","2","0"

It's good.\n\nLet the whiny comments and negative reviews of this review roll because I don't get a nerdcry over Uplay.\n\nUpdate: Please realize I am not reading any of these comments or whatever so.. yeah.\n\nAnyhoo, the game is pretty great, I like the opening campaign sequence. It's much more interesting than VI which was blehhh . Everything works fine on the highest settings, and the "storytelling" of the campaign is nifty, voice acting is alright. Can't wait to play more and enjoy myself.\n\nBecause I actually bought the game to play it since I love the series and I don't care about uPlay and neither should U (get it? uPlay? u?)\n\nAlso, calling people "sheeple" is so 2009, step up your game (Ok so I did see ONE comment before the "Shut Up!" Chrome App (highly recommended by the way, it saves you from reading internet comments)\n\n:)","September 29, 2015","true","26.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","72"

The game is a solid addition to the series. I've been playing HOMM since the first one came on the scene when I was kid. HOMM7 is a throw back to the 5th one which I enjoyed a ton!\n\nThe skill tree is new but familar and the equipable items thus far seem identical to the 5th series. If you've ever played any of the series you can pick this up like a champ. While the graphics are not as clean as I'd expect they're not that bad either. The orcs look a bit arabian unlike the warriors I expected but whatever I can get over minor preferences.\n\nThe opening animations seem to get some hate too but for me, it's interesting and I'd rather them spend the time and money on game mechanics anyway.

I play Might and Magic from the beginning. So I started with Heroes of  Might and Magic 1 and I have bought and played all the following Heroes of Might and Magic games. All those bad comments make me doubt to buy this game. With patch 1.06 I deceided to buy and I am very very glad that I did that. Heroes VII IS FANTASTIC. I have played the hotseat tilll Heroes III because the next versions were not that fun enough.\n\nHEROES VII has given back the fun and the races we all loved to play. This game feels like the old days and all the fun I have had with it. I have played several hot seat games with different races and I have discovered no errors or bugs. What I discovered was a beautiful 3D world with beautiful heroes, monsters and fights.\n\nThe graphics are very very beautiful also the castles are inside, I really like the level up tech tree. The best and funniest level up tech tree I have ever seen in a Heroes game. This make you want to level up and to get more and more spells and skills. This also is with the artifacts you will find. The music and the sounds are also very beautiful. Also during the fights. This is so much better then in Heroes 6. Also the music in the castles are very nice and beautiful.\n\nThe controls feels as usual and more of that. The different options you have are very very good. Ai speed, adventure speed, combat speed, camerea scroll speed etc. II really like the option to slide the fight movie cam from 0 till 100. So you can choice how much you want to have a cutscene form your fight. Overall, I am very very pleased that I have bought this game.

You are buying a broken product that even 3 months after release contains game breaking bugs (v1.6).\n\nNote: This review addresses only the campaign aspects of the game. I have not touched multiplayer.\n\nThe Good:\n-The bare bones HOMM series mechanics are there and, for the most part, work.\n-The addition of flanking is an interesting change.\n-Fortifications are a nice idea.\n-The AI is very fast and the game responds well to input.\n\nThe Meh:\n-Graphics are decent but not a visible improvement over the previous instalment.\n-The fact that they reused a lot of the HOMM6 textures is a bit off-putting.\n-The slide show "cutscenes" feel cheap.\n-The dialogue is bland and cringeworthy but this has been the case with HOMM since HOMM4.\n-The spell book looks very cheap but the spell animations look decent.\n-Hero customization and itemization feels inferior to previous instalments. The items and skills feel like they don't have as much impact as in previous games.\n-Castle screens are still a mess. Not as bad as the Lego pieces in HOMM6 but nowhere near the beauty of HOMM5 animation.\n-The tooltips and GUI feel very cheap and intrusive.\n\nMost of these are minor complaints, but it's exactly because they are so minor and easily rectifiable that they are so frustrating for me. It feels like the devs are investing the bare minimum of effort to check off different features which in previous games added a lot of value.\n\nThe Bad:\nMost egregious: the game crashes during Necropolis mission 4 (after the second dialogue with Zenda). I can't even finish the second campaign. It's possible that this is an issue with my configuration (Radeon R9 290 GPU + i5 3570K CPU; Win7 64bit) however, it's the first time I've encountered something like this in what I thought was supposed to be an AAA release.\n\nAfter completing the Haven campaign + the first 3 missions of Necropolis here's what I can tell you about the actual gameplay problems:\n\nSeveral in-game bugs:\n-Moving artifacts around sometimes causes them to disappear or behave erratically.\n-Several creature abilities do not work properly (Marksman's "Piercing Shot" doesn't actually affect the tiles it's showing).\n-Some campaign mission events aren't very well scripted. For example: you can "break" the scripted Necropolis Mission 3 ending by recalling to one of your castles.\n\nThe AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a lot of aspects. In most previous HOMM games, even on normal, the AI knows not to move their melee units into the player’s melee unit range during the first turn. In this one, they just mindlessly rush you, always moving as close to you as possible. In previous installments the AI knew not to suicide their heroes into fights they have 0% chance of winning (I've had the AI run heroes with a few core creatures into my fortified castle with 5 champions + several Elites).\n\nConclusion: even if you ignore the game breaking bugs you are still buying a mediocre product. If you take into account the blatantly broken aspects of the game this is a downright terrible investment. First HOMM purchase I genuinely regret, even with the winter sale discount. This will be the last game in the series that I purchase.","December 26, 2015","false","68.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The gameplay and the battles are what we know about HOMM, so no complaining about that.\nGraphics are in my opinion good, the sound too. So i like the game\n\nThere are a few little things which I think it could better.\n\n1) The game doesn't remember the game settings, for example I disable the introduction of the enemy at the start of a battle, but everytime I start my game again I need to disable it again.\n\n2) Because of the level cap, in my opinion are many skills according to their skillwheel from the heroes you have or can hire wrong assigned. For exaple in the stronghold campaign you get Imani. She needs Bloodrage, Defence and Warfare for her full Chieftain capacity. But pre assigned are Bloodrage, Defence, Diplomacy and Explorer.\n\n3) After played the campaign and like to do a skirmish map you can't hire/start the heroes you like. Danan (mystic Sylvan) Zenda and Anastasya (necropolis) are unavailable.\n\nBut overall I still like the game","January 2","true","322.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Now depending on your faction different structures lead to different things and there are a bunch of special structures per faction with choice structures as well.\n\nAs of right now this is my favorite Heroes title, with 1 main shortcoming - there needs to be a Random Map Generator for more replayability, but I'm guessing that's in the works anyway.","January 1","true","205.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

After all, cinematics can be ignored and crashes can be fixed, but levels really affect the fun you can have.\n\nI started with the wizard campaign, the first level of which is possibly the worst designed level I've encountered in games.\n\nYou start with two heroes who at some point get separated. Nothing you do before they get separated really matters, because your troop counts get reset to the value the designers think you should have at this point anyway (I hadn't lost a single creature, but after the separation some were missing). While separated, there's a couple of gates that one hero can only open after the other hero unlocks it, meaning that usually one of your two heroes is not doing anything except wait in front of a gate.\n\nThese are just minor annoyances beside the fact that there's two spots in the level where you can pretty much randomly lose, through no real fault of yourself, making you resort to the autosaves to be able to play on.\n\nThe first is a "riddle" where you have to pull 4 levels in a specific order. The clues given don't seem to bear any meaning that I could decypher. Get it wrong three times and you have to fight an unwinnable fight.\n\nThe second auto-lose spot is right after. You get the mission to have your two heroes meet up and exchange a quest item (you don't really get a warning that this is your quest now btw, your path is simply blocked and you're supposed to check the quest log yourself to notice it's updated). After you exchange the item, you get a new quest to defeat the bad guy within 7 turns. Unless you knew ahead of time that this meant being close to the spirit gate that you now suddenly can travel through (it was nonfunctional before),  you probably are too far away from where you have to be to get there in time, meaning you have to open a savegame from before your heroes met up, make sure they meet up next to the gate and then continue.\n\nOh, and the quest item you got grants you a spell, castable once per combat that destroys the entire enemy army of the big climatic final fight in one spell cast.\n\nDuring all that, there's a "story". In it, your lesbian protagonist is literally accused of beastiality because her lover is a djinn (looks like a lovely lady to me, shrug). Not that she seems to love her that much, because she doesn't try very hard to desuade her lover from killing herself so that she can have a bit more power to defeat the enemy (who, by the way, she sortof believes is on the right side, though that doesn't stop her from killing him anyway). Earlier you talk with a proud orc who vows to take some secret to his grave, until you threaten to kill him, after which he spills it immediately. After which you kill him anyway.\n\nIt is frankly impressive they managed to get so much wrong in a single level.\n","September 30, 2015","false","3.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Ok so first release was not perfect, but patch 1.2 fixed a lot of bugs and I am very hopeful for the next couple of releases.\n\nCampaign is actually pretty fun, every heroes had crappy campaigns and actully this one is one of the best.  Yes cutscenes suck, but we don't really care, as long as story is good and gameplay is fun, which it is.\n\nGameplay is really great, it's on par and even better than Heroes V, magic wheel is good and you also have the choice to get the 4 random choices like older versions.  So far played with 2 factions and have enjoyed them, can't way to try the other ones.\n\nTown screen is great, simple and to the point, spells are great, a lot of variety there.  Units variety is pretty good so far, haven't played every faction but enjoying the variety thus far.\n\nI am actually playing with laptop (i7, integrated HD 4400 and SSD) and can play with medium graphics settings (1200 x 720).  I am sure the game would perform a lot better with better GPU, but am still impressed with the result.\n\nThings to improve:\n-Graphics and design should be improved, it's ok, but could be a lot better, the only place where Heroes VI is better than VII is in graphics.\n-Sounds and music should be improved, it's kind of generic, especially in battles.\n-GUI is ok, could be better.\n\nSo far great game and will be enjoying next updates and hopefully new content!","October 15, 2015","true","28.4"," 31 of 63 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","31","63","2","0"

It is a return to the Heroes past. It was nice not to have to deal with the horrible conflux issues that plagued Heroes VI.\n\nHowever, in Heroes VII players once again had to battle with a mountain of bugs despite two Beta trials. Very disappointing. Unforseen compatibility issues are understandable, campaign breaking bugs and basic game play bugs are unacceptable. I for one an fed up with Ubisoft's habit of releasing games unfinished. With many of the bugs finally fixed with patch 1.4, the game is playable.\n\nAll the basic are there but the still screen movies are disappointing but not a major problem. The 6 scenarios were a welcome addition. The skill wheels are a great idea. The town portals are frustrating in that you can't choose which portal you wish to go to.\n\nWhat is a serious problem is the severe lack of playable skirmish maps. Sure there is a map editor, but not every player has hours to spend on building playable maps. Most players do not want to spend more time making new maps than actually playing the game! New fans are unlikely to find the world builder useable. Sadly long term replayability of the game is just not there without spending more time making maps than playing the game. Fans were seriously short changed.\n\nHaving been an avid fan since H2, I love the game but I am disappointed with the typical Ubisoft short changing of their customers. However, the essence of previous Heroes games  is there.","November 7, 2015","true","663.1"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","21","43","3","0"

However, the patch 1.2 and 1.3 has turned the situation around magically.\n\nI started playing HoMM2 in 1997, and has been playing each installment ever since. I am happy to say the current incarnation of HoMM7 is a worthy successor.\n\nIn term of the game play itself, HoMM reached its height at HoMM3 and more or less plateaued from there on. There are additions and reductions in each installments since then, but core functions are about the same. HoMM7 is no different.\n\nThe major improvement, AFAIK, is the graphic. UE3 is a popular engine and is behind many major titles in the past 5 years. It is NOT outdated, as most UE4 games won't be out until 2016.\n\nThere are still improvement to be made for sure. Improve AI, improve multi-player, improve map editor's performance, etc. All of those will determine if the game has long-lasting values after all campaign and customize maps are done.

From a long time player of this series Heros M&M was my very first strategy game so I have a huge investment with this series hence the pre-order on a Ubisoft title.   That being said a game that is slow paced and strategy base relies heavily on its story plot and cinematics.  What concerns me is the lack of animation made clear at the start of the campaign before ever choosing your hero. You can hear the sound and if u look close enough tell the tongue is moving beyond that there is no facial animation in the opening cinematic or subsequent.  I am hoping details like this are bugs like issues with the animations so they were frozen as to allow release on time.  Remember devs have no true final say on a products release date they give an estimated date and marketing takes it and sets the release date. However if they are not bug related and they actually didnt rig or animate those sections of bones I for one would be highly disappointed in the production pipeline of their studio.\n\nEven indie devs manage to release with the animations.  Ark Survival evolved) is an un optimized game that always has bugs being worked on or not, but the Dinosaurs were there on release walking and dying properly.\n\nNow more to the point the animations of the characters during battle sequence wasnt bad.  However it leaves much to be desired when every cinematic breaks your immersion. Compounded by desyncing multiplayer games.  I do not recommend this game in its current state wll update this review as patches are launched.\n\n","September 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

I feel like with this game I was the vitctim of a bait and switch. The game is functional as a M&M game, but the production value is highly lacking for the price tag.\n\nThe "cinematics" are just still 3D shots with the characters talking over them, which is extremely clunky to look at and is awkward to watch. The ingame graphics are stiff are frankly they are worse than M&M 6, which is odd to take a step backwards. Lastly the combat is lacking in that the units hit animations and sounds lack any punch, I dont get any sense of impact with the attacks or the sound effects. It seems like  a small gripe but when the thing you enjoy most about the game is underwhelming it is disappointing.\n\nOn the whole the game doesn't appear bad, I just feel that the price tag for what is delivered is miss matched.

Therefore, after pondering things carefully, I decided to change my public impression of this game. I have disregarded the technical difficulties of the release in hope that they will get fixed relatively shortly down the road, but after over one month of patching, the game is still unplayable, bugridden, crashing and desynchronizing in multiplayer consistently.

I have had one crash in 26 hours, something I experience with other games too (it's probably my weird setup with SSD raid, I sometimes crash just browsing the net).\nWhy didnt they wait a bit to release directly a good game at launch? The abysmal critics at launch almost made me pass this.\nI can't really comment about global balance, I'm still playing the campaign, but so far I like the factions that I played.\n\nI am very glad I ignored the bad reviews, this is going to last me a long time.\n\nEdit (addition): patches are released on a frequent basis, and the game feels actually very stable. Balance is pretty good, although there are still two factions which I have not played.\n\nWhat I like is that the spirit of the best HOMM games is back: the game is not linear. You have to plan each day of the week, assemble carefuly your teams, change hero depending on the next fight, etc.\nMy only disappointments so far are:\n- the overabundance of artifacts in the campaigns.

I wanted this game to be at least as good as previous heroes\n\nAlas.  Among the issues I've discovered:\n\n- Character animations appear to be broken and stuttery in many places.  (I'm looking at you trogladytes)\n\n- The intro video is done in a hybrid still-life characters / real time fire animation that actually made me think that the characters were frozen.  If they're not supposed to move, why does EVERYTHING ELSE move?  Seems like they ran out of time to make the cut-scenes animated and just said "to heck with it.  Freeze them"  It's weird.  You'll think it's broken.  Seriously.\n\n- The "zoom" animation they have going into battles is incredibly disorienting.  Not "cool", just disorienting.\n\n- There's not enough contrast on the maps to see where anything is.  You'll frequently overlook things because they blend in too well.\n\n- It doesn't scale well at large resolutions.  I've tried it at 2560 and 1980 resolutions, but fonts are too big, and combat dialogs appear half off the screen for a second or two before jumping where they should be.\n\n- Something about combat just isn't exciting.  Maybe it's the music.  Maybe it's the textures.  Who knows, but I'm missing the coolness that was in previous Heroes games.\n\n- The list goes on and on (meaning I can't think of any right now but DARN IT I'm sure I will)!\n\nI want, I want, I WANT to change my mind about this game.  Maybe with a few patches we'll be there.  But right now, I can't recommend this.\n\n","September 29, 2015","false","49.7"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

It works okay on my computer on ultra/high, though there are still a few bugs for them to work through.  I'm on patch 4 I think now.  If you are familiar with the series, I haven't found anything extraordinarily new to the franchise.  The skill wheel is about the newest thing.  If you like the previous game VI, then you'll find this pretty adequate.  I haven't attempted multiplayer; I usually don't with a new game.  I wait until they tweek the balance and the connection issues with most games.  The biggest complaint, which is the same one for VI, they just can't seem to recapture the spectacular city screens that they had in V.  They're pretty, but don't have that wow factor that the 3d redered and flying ones did in 5.  I think that causes it to feel a little more like a board game and little less like an engrossing computer game.  I have finished the Human, Undead, and Mage campaigns.

I liked the direction that they were taking starting with M&M V  and thought M&M VI was a step in the right direction.  But this version feels like a step back to M&M 1 & 2 with the small icons representing structures in the environment ruining the immursion. In early games these short cuts made sense as the graphics of the time could not handle that much more.  But they have had the ability to build better environments for some time as can be seen in M&M V and M&M VI so I simply don't get the vast departure from a formula that worked in this version.\n\nI purchased the game when it first came out but so hated the current direction with the artwork on the maps that I asked for and was granted a Steam refund.

Do not get confused with all negative reviews. Although there are some bugs and slow loading time, they are all getting patched up continuously. İ definitely recommend this game to all turn based strategy players who love heroes series, kings bounty series, etc...","November 7, 2015","true","70.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

As stated in the previous review, the game is a generally fun game but does not really add anything new to the genre.\n\nHowever, as it stands and after more time spent on the game, I honestly cannot recommend the game in it's current state.\n\nIt is buggy beyond belief. Previously, I encountered several minor bugs/glitches involving skills or enemy AI or spell/skill effects and such. Most of these were relatively minor and I was prepared to give Ubisoft time to patch these up as most did not really affect gameplay drastically.\n\nRight now, I've encountered what seems to be a fairly common game-breaking bug (as per the game/steam forums) where loading a save file causes the game to crash to the desk-top. The ridiculous thing is that when this 'glitch' occurs it seems to corrupt/affect ALL the other save files. In other words, once you crash one in a campaign map/scenario, you effectively cannot load any other save files!\n\nThe thoughtless manner in which the devs designed the game ui is such that you cannot even now reload the map/scenario when this bug happens but have to restart the whole campaign ...\n\nBroken beyond playability. Do not buy until fixed/patched.","October 1, 2015","false","95.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Playing with the "random" option for hero skill improvements makes progression very similar to pre-VI games. It actually feels somewhat like HoMM3.\n\nI have only played sandbox skirmishes, as I don't care much for campaigns in these games.\n\nI was very pleased to see that UBI brought back the 4 rare resources instead of just crystals. They also got rid of the "main hero" feature from what I can tell. Again, I am happy about the revision.\n\nAt first I only thought that the SFX were atrocious. Upon closer inspection though, I've realized that the entire game is lacking. IMHO the graphics are WORSE than the 10 year old HoMM5. Lame spell effects!\nThe combat is less interesting also. There are fewer caster units. Take genies for example. Instead of being able to hurl blesses/debuffs from afar, they have to attack in order to implement their debuff.\n\nThey took a step or two forward from HoMM6, but then took several backwards. This is a bad product as is. I'll keep an eye out for patches, because it still has some potential based on the core game and a nice map editor. I'll probably give HoMM5 another go in the meantime.","October 2, 2015","false","10.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Some are really serious, as in missions not being able to be finnished.

The cutscenes are ... not anything you really talk about in regards of state of the art, but they still tell the story that is the background for the game in a way where you just want to continue to see what the next map will bring.\n\nNow to the actual gameplay:\n\n- the missions offer a high variety of goals (not just capture all towns etc.),\n- scripted events actually surprise you, sometimes in a positive way sometimes with a groan\n- the combats run smoothly, the units are balanced and with the skillwheel you don't just go the old heroes VI cookie cutter builds\n\nSo if you can look past all the naysayers and give the actual game a try you will soon find yourself facing the old problems heroes always had.

I've been fortunate and I haven't had any problems, and I can only rate this game off of my own experience; which has been pretty good so far. The core gameplay is very solid and this game has all the ingredients there to be a fantastic heroes game. The graphics are nice. The animations are great. The storytelling is decent enough. The addition of a map editor with a RMG is nice. The combat is as fun as in any other heroes game. The town screens are a pleasant oldschool 2d approach. Most of the spell effects are cool.\n\nI do have problems with it, but I hope these things can be ironed out and improved in future patches/expansions. The sound needs work. Certain animations don't have sound effects that should. And the town screen music sometimes cuts off for no apparent reason. The non-cinematic cinematics do feel super cheap and just don't really work from an artistic standpoint. The user interface is shoddy, and the skill wheel just seems like a pointless "innovation".\n\nAll in all, I think Heroes 7 has the potential to be the best HoMM game since 3, if it receives the proper support. So I sincerely hope that Limbic provides that, and don't just give up due to the wave of negative feedback they've been receiving.\n\n","October 5, 2015","true","33.1"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","43","16","37","5","0"

Most of the bugs I encountered were of the game breaking nature and forced me to restart the respective mission. But I never had problems loading into the game and it didn't crash on me even once. Therefore, I am not overly affected by the bugs since having to restart a mission might be a big annoying but at the same time it is nothing horrible and allows you to optimize your farming pattern and readjust skillbuilds of the heroes.\n\nPublishing a game with so many problems shouldn't be done and can be considered an insult to the customers. Yet, I am still recommending the game because the campaign is beautifully crafted, the mission design is pretty awesome and you instantly get sucked in by the typical Heroes of Might and Magic charme that makes it so hard to stop playing.\n\nIf you liked the other Heroes of Might and Magic games and if you do not care too much about missing animations during what "could" be called cut-scenes if there were animations, you will enjoy this. If all you want to do is ride around, collect stuff, build huge armies and strong heroes, then you WILL enjoy this game. The pace during the campaign is quite high, which is why this game clearly is NOT RECOMMENDABLE for beginners. There is no tutorial whatsoever, no introduction to mechanics, if you never played a game of this genre, you might be overwhelmed and pretty helpless. As a HOMM veteran, I think that is awesome, since you are just thrown right into the big epic fights!\n\nOne downside that has to be mentioned is the quite horrible AI. The fights are far from "hard" and even playing on heroic, you can easily defeat "deadly" enemies if you know how to play. The AI moves around confusedly, suicide attacks sometimes (without doing too much damage) and generally just isn't a real challenge. But then again, since HOMM3: AB no Heroes was really challenging and I still liked them, simply because the story is interesting.","October 6, 2015","true","47.3"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","16","37","0","0"

I am on mission four or five of Wizard so it may be different for the other campaigns.\n+Caravans and reinforcement spell! You rarely have to backtrack because you can now summon or caravan new units in pretty efficiently.\n+Heroes are ridiculously powerfull, you can easily win battles that are not in your favor numbers wise with some tier 4 spells(I can see how that can be a negative for certain players though)\n+ Maps take a lot less time to complete in comparison to Heroes 6 which I find a major plus due to the fact that I would get bored or have to stop and pick it up later half way through most of the really long maps on Heroes 6.\n\nNegatives\n- Story is weak(at least for wizard campaign). I dont really care for the protagonist mostly because there is very little dialogue.\n- Clipscenes are still images with voices narrating the scene with the camera zooming in on the person "talking". Not sure if this was a poor design choice or laziness I am leaning towards the latter.\n- Two of the wizards missions gave off a side quest feeling that did not offer anything to progress the main story line.  I hope I don't run into many more of these.\n\n\nBUGS: The only bug I have run into with this game is a unit died on the final battle of the map and it wouldn't proceed to the next turn so I had to reload the fight. Also some of the spells you can use outside combat would occasionally not activate so you have to cast them again (pain in the ♥♥♥ for town recall). I am currently using an i7 12 Gig ram and a 670 nvidia graphics card.\n\nOverally I would definitely recommend this game to those who enjoy the Heroes franchise, they barely changed the forumula but really took a lot of the best aspects of the Heroes series and put them into one game. If the story picks up I can say this may be one of my favorites.","October 1, 2015","true","42.5"," 108 of 229 people (47%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","47","108","229","18","0"

You were very skeptical about the people with 1.3 or even a megalithic 3.7 hours in this game giving it a bad review.\n\nTLDR: AI is very dynamic and adjustable for people looking for a more challenging experience. Those complaining about "slow gameplay" might be new to the series or simply not used to it, being as it is a unique style of startagy game in general that isn't re-created every other day you log-into steam. (Zombie, Survival Sandbox, JRPG, Pixel Grapic Adventure Games, ect.) There have been very minimal bugs in my experiece though this may not be true for everyone. Campaign has been a blast although I did turn voices off because they have rarely been good in any game ever. This game should be cleaned up with a patch and will be solid gold for any true HoMM fan.  All this game needs is "3DO" at the beggining to make me smile even more.\n\nI read a lot of complaints about the CGI being "cheap" and I honestly don't care myself so I may seem biased but if you really care about that enough to dislike the entire game then yes I would tell you that the cutscenes aren't mind-blowing. It's such a small fraction of the game though and really not worth being sour about considering whats beneath it all. It's your life, time, and energy though..use it as you like.\n\nThe AI is easy enough for begginers at normal difficulty or for someone learning the new dynamics of the game. If you want a real challenge then try Heroic difficulty to make all your masochistic dreams come true. I'm still picking my teeth up off the ground. You can select maps that will take you a few hours to an entire real time week long. Thats one of the reasons I like this game. I can play many different campaign types, start new maps to figure things out, play the same game for a very long time, or go online to play against other human beings. Lots of options on only a vanilla version of the game.\n\nThe maps are absolutely beautiful; serious nostaliga rolls in from every corner. The music is awesome, atmospheric, and engaging. Theres a glitch right now as of 10/2/2015 where the music stops looping. In battle this is more obvious but i'm sure this will be sorted out in less than a weeks time.\n\nThe skill wheel is awesome. You can build your city at amazing speeds right away with certain skills trees that help economic growth like being able to build twice in each holding every day or increase income of gold and resources. Caravans work wonderfully and when utilized correctly can help the flow of gameplay quite a bit. The maps offer tons of secrets and potential advatages if used correctly, potentially changing the flow of the game. The town screens are very nicely done and the progression tree for each very much pays homage to the older games of this series. You can make your heroes governors of certain holdings to gain great buffs and even spec into different types of magic as you go. The items in the vanilla version so far are awesome. Back to the old school in ways that HoMM VI really detered from.\n\nMy favorite part is that I never have to look at Uplay. I booted it up the first time and it asked me to sync my steam account. After I did that I simply just start the game through steam and it starts right away. After i'm done it syncs with the cloud and closes up through a HoMM splash screen on my desktop. I'm easily going to forget what Uplay looks like.\n\nOn top of all this, the map editor is absolutely stupendous.This game is a breath of fresh air for the HoMM series..finally! I feel bad for the people who are really frustrated with the game after only a few hours of gameplay but hopefully they get their refunds and move on to another game they truly enjoy playing. As for any of you considering this game.. if you're worried about little bugs just wait a few days to a week. Other than that i'd say pull the trigger. If you like HoMM I think that after you give it an honest try you'll be pleasently suprised.","October 2, 2015","true","30.2"," 37 of 82 people (45%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","45","37","82","5","4"

The creature abilities are interesting and the battles are fun.  Further, when you're just going around stomping creatures on the map, the auto batttle is handy; if you lose more troops than you care to accept, you can still choose to fight the battle manually.  I like the ability wheel in this game more than I liked the ability selection in any of the prior games.\n\nHowever... it does have issues.  The low performance on this game is insane.  The graphics are suitable, but that's it. There's no reason it should run as slowly as it does.  The cut scenes?  At first I actually thought they weren't playing correctly because I have an older computer.  However, I got online and started reading and realized that no, there is no animation.  Is that just laziness?  Did Ubi think they developed such a good game that there was no need for animation, that the story would speak for itself?  It's just an oddly lazy decision to decide not to animate the game.\n\nIf you're a big Heroes fan, go ahead and buy this; it can be enjoyable.  If not... well, move along, nothing to see here.  This should not be somebody's introduction to the Heroes franchise.  Heroes III, V or VI would be much better.\n\nI will give this a tentative recommendation.","November 1, 2015","true","85.8"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","8","22","2","0"

I was going to take everyones advice and purchase it when it was on sale in a year or so.  There is a lot of hate for this game it seems, but I really wanted to immerse myself into this game like I have with it's predecessors.  I struggled with the notion of dropping full price for the game for nearly a week.   I finally gave into my urge despite the rhetoric about the game, and I can honestly say I'm having so much fun!  I'm glad I paid full price as this will encourage them to continue to build expansions for this awesome game, that I will happily pay for as soon as they are made available.  There is more strategy in this game than it's predecessors and this really excites me.   The skill wheel is awesome, and each hero  is actually more unique now than ever.  I'm so glad the elves are back because they have always been my favorite to play.  The elves are more enriched in this version than they ever have been!\nI must admidt I purchased the game after the patch and I do not play multiplayer mode so I can not account to the bugs expressed in that area of the game.  I haven't had any poor experiences with bugs yet.  Bugs will kill a game for me quickly, there have been a few great games, that i loved to play, have their playtime shortened due to bad bugs.  I have not come accross any game ending bugs for me, and thats what i fretted about the most after reading the reveiws.  I'm so glad, that i have a difficult time expressing in words at the moment, that I purchased this game.  In my opinion, It's the best version yet, and I welcome with open arms any DLC/Expansions!","October 24, 2015","true","346.3"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

I haven't experienced any issues with Uplay or performance (Win 7 64bit, i5 2500k, GTX 560 Ti). Too early to make conclusive judgments as to where it stands relative to the other Heroes titles but I feel it is a step up from 5 & 6. I give every Heroes game a shot and this one is just fun to play and that is all I was hoping for.\n\nEdit 05/Oct/2015:\n\nThe Haven campaign was mostly fine. The only issue was not being able to assign the ultimate skills to certain heroes that were picked up on the third mission.\n\nNow having started the Sylvan campaign I came across more unforgiving problems. The main issue for me was that save games started to get corrupted on the third Sylvan mission. I essentially had to play through that entire mission with certain 'checkpoints'. By that I mean that there were certain savegames that would work but most of them wouldn't. So If your game crashed for whatever reason you would have to restart at that 'checkpoint' which in my case was about an hour behind my current point in the mission.\n\nAnother issue is the AI. While playing on Heroic I never encountered the AI using the special abilities of the creatures.\n\nTDLR: With the above issues in mind I would say that the game has potential in terms of gameplay but  requires quite a bit of polish to iron out some of these very annoying bugs.","September 30, 2015","true","92.4"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","16","39","0","0"

And for the most part, I am not disappointed. There are a few things that I would guess will be addressed through future patches but overall, they aren't deal breakers for me. A lot of people had problems with the game launching on the first day. For myself, I found that it would only launch through steam if I first had Uplay running in the background. As of this moment, I still need to have UPlay up or it will not launch through steam. There is also a significant wait time when I first launching the game. It's a minor annoyance at best that I think will be fixed at some point.\n\nAs far as graphics go, they aren't bad. The screenshots are a little deceiving thought. The game screen is not as crisp as the screen shots would lead you to believe. They aren't bad but they could be cleaned up a little. What I really like is the artwork and design of the creatures. It's not just a copy of creatures from previous games either. There is a nice variety of creatures that are decently animated, for this type of game. But I almost suspect that some of the screen shots were touched up a little.\n\nI'm not really deep into the campiagns yet but so far, this one seems slightly easier than some of the previous campaigns from earlier games. So far, I've only played it on normal difficulty so I can't really speak on other difficulties. So far, I haven't had to restart  a map because of being overwhelmed by the enemy too early. I haven't played through all of the faction campaigns yet so maybe I have just gotten lucky so far.  It's a decent challenge so far but not overwhelming. The main thing is that I am having fun with it and that's what it's really about for me. It definitely has that HOMM feel and I am enjoying it very much. I would definitely recommend it if you are a fan of these types of games.","October 2, 2015","true","315.6"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","16","39","0","0"

Sure, it does not top Homm3, but I doubt that any new Homm ever will.  So I recommend this game to any fan of the series and here is why:\n\n+ Looks good (way better than 6, due to Unreal engine)\n+ Campaign is interesting\n+ Towns are not the cluster♥♥♥♥ that Heroes 6 offered. This includes the looks, the upgrade tree (magic guild are back, choices which buildings to make / upgrade etc), ressources (7 this time) and overall design\n+ New units\n+ Characterprogression way better than Heroes 6\n\nNegatives:\n- Weird cutscenes (3D-Models that are not animated with a voiceover - looks really cheap)\n- Combat tooltips wrong sometimes (units retaliate even though the tooltip says they wont)\n- Objectives not always clear (talking about campaign)\n\nTo adress some of the complaints in other reviews: I didnt have one crash in about 7,5h of playing. The sounds in combat do feel sluggisch, thought higher tier units tend to have way more satisfying sfx. Yes, Uplay, whatever, doesnt really bother me.\n\nAll in all: if you are interested and can afford it without hesitation, you should pick this game up and enjoy it for what it is: a solid Heroes expirience and a huge upgrade from part 6. Else just wait until it goes on sale.","September 30, 2015","true","11.5"," 34 of 77 people (44%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","44","34","77","5","1"

Im sorry to hear so many people are having trouble. I myself have not come across anything game breaking. Glitches aside, I find the game to be a fun and worthy addition to the franchise. The different factions have great variety. The battles are the same classic fun system that I'm used to.\n\nIt's true that it doesn't really add any big new features or make any monumental changes, but it includes all the game play features that I identify with M&M games and it executes them well (when they aren't glitching). The good news is that M&M, despite this screw up, is in the hands of a worthy development team who are owning their mistake, Some of the issues they are fixing take more than a weekend to fix, so I know some people are mad that the patch is taking more than a few days, but its either that or a rushed patch (and rushed patches can sometimes introduce new problems!)","October 7, 2015","true","5.6"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"

This is a game that has always needed tweeks and adjustments for a time after release (via patches).  Further, no version (save Heroes I) has been "great" until expansions were released.  Heroes 3 was best upon release and best post expansion.  For most of us who have played them all, H3 is the benchmark.  As of the first day of release, H7 comes close and I'll elaborate as to why below.\n\nHeroes has always been a mix of turn-based-strategy and RPG with a big dose of "discovery and conquest".  Parts "Risk" and "Civilization", parts Chess and other such games, with decent stories, interesting Heroes, and a wide assortment of creatures to use in armies.\n\nH7 is no exception.  In fact, developers intended for this to have some of the best elements of the series throughout its history.  While my final judgement will come after it is "Complete", I'd say this one is well on its way.\n\nFor players like myself, immersion is the key.  Does it get me invested in the battles and the urgencies that come with a strategy/rpg?  Am I excited about the discovery aspect?  Are there surprises along the way?  Is there a variety that keeps me interested and re-playing?  Answer:  YES.\n\nTop that off with the best Map Editor (with a Random Map Generator) since H4 and its reasonable to conclude that this one has staying power.  One of the best parts about the Heroes Community, is the fan made maps shared via sites like Celestial Heavens and Maps4Heroes.  Keeps the game fresh and interesting.  Developers boast too that the editor has a modding element that make the possibilities endless.\n\nIn my house, we're playing the Hot Seat all the time with some combination of my wife, my 7 yr old daughter, my 15 yr old son and myself with my 4 yr old son rooting us on.\n\nI look forward to playing more.  I look forward to expansions.  In fact, I'd love to skip work right now to play.","September 30, 2015","true","444.5"," 100 of 219 people (46%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","46","100","219","17","7"

I thought it was a disgrace that there was no support for windows 10. I spent hours upon hours screwing around with the settings etc, still nothing. Eventually they released the hot fix so I could play it.\n\nInitial thoughts were average, I can deal with the DX9 graphics, that’s not what HOMM is about its about gameplay. That being said I don’t actually mind the gameplay, I have only played a bit of the arcane campaign, I’m not sure if the other campaigns are as disjointed as this one, but it doesn’t have a flowing story through the campaign which is a bit weird. Not a massive fan of this.\n\nSound and music are not the best, not the worst. Animations are ok, I think they just played it safe with respect to this game. But underneath it all there is a little bit of the Heroes 3 charm in there. I’m sticking with it. Still disgusted with the fact that they clearly did not test windows 10 capability but all in all the game is definitely worth playing through. It’s not HOMM3, but I think it’s a good addition to the series. Probably not worth full price, I’d wait for a sale if you’re on the fence about buying it.\n","October 1, 2015","true","20.7"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","9","26","0","0"

Major points:\n\nTo those of you who feel this game hasn't evolved enough... look at what has happened to final fantasy due to all their innovation. The whole console series is now garbage and it was once gold. There ARE other games to play than first person shooters and action rpgs. Dont fix what isn't broken.\n\nThe only REAL complaint to make about this game are the motion graphics. Heroes levitating across maps instead of galloping. Mobs on combat often float diagonally and not in a way that looks at all normal. I've played two maps and I'm going to set this one down for a few months and hope this get's worked out.\n\nThe cutscenes do look like crazy wax scenes and it's hard to tell what they were going for. My guess is this game got pushed out before it was ready (which btw, who told gaming studios it was ok to release unfinished products?! It seems to be the norm these days). Perhaps the scenematic movements are not there the same as the combat/map movements are off but it is obviously due to a lack of polish.\n\nGreat points. This game is beautiful otherwise. Not at all cartoony like 6. They did make leaps in graphics, but perhaps they just haven't quite finished the job.

I have put a good bit of time into this game already and I love it. The animations are beautiful and the designa and layout of the maps is pretty good. There are even areas cosed off in certain maps until you unlock them by visiting shrines and the like. Spell animations are great as well. I find it interesting how they show the opening of each campaign with a still frame on the speaker as they talk. its kind of cool and looks great ithout animating their mouth. Are there bugs? sure there are. But the game has been out only 6 days as of my writing this. None of the bugs are really gamebreaking either. The storylines are all well written as well. Literally my only complaint is that The campaigns take much less time than they did in five or six. Ive nearly beaten the undead with and human campaigns and havent put in more than 20 hours as of now. Other than that, great game. I would give it an 8.5/10. Also, I have a really good computer and have yet to experience any bugs. Maybe all of you complaining of bugs and craqshes need to get a better PC. I have 16GB RAM, 4.5GHz processor, two 4GB graphics cards running on crossfire, and enough power and space for the game. It runs perfectly and the only bug Ive experienced was losing a save by booting it up on my laptop from the UPlay Cloud. Im a veteran of the series and have played al lthe games from HOMM3 to this one. Its really not bad, but all the people leaving bad reviews after less than 5 hours of play time dont deserve to have their reviews taken seriously. I Its a good game and I wholeheartedly recommend it.","October 5, 2015","true","22.6"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

Finished most of them, too.\n\nAnd I personally would recommend the current incarnation.\n\nOh, sure, it's far from perfect. They skimped on things that seem just silly to skimp on, especially for such a big name (company and game). Cutscenes and menus, and the interface in general, look like they were designed a good 10 years ago. The town screen is..okay.. but come on, when they had the majesty of H V's Haven to draw from?\n\nHowever, to me most of the drawbacks are fairly trivial, at least so far. It helps that so far I have not experienced a single bug or crash, unlike Heroes VI which I found to be simply unplayable at launch. Bitter disappointment that, was glad it didn't turn out similarly..though, I guess there's still time.\n\nThe graphics are good. Design, excellent. I'm alternating between this one and the Witcher 3, and I find no cause to complain about this.\n\nThe formula is the classical one, which to be fair it was what the fans expected. And it's good! Combat and hero progression feel vastly more satisfying than Heroes VI.\n\nThere are a number of blasts from the pasts which also make me glad - such as the return of the Magic Guild, Thieves Guild, and the War Machines of yore.\n\nThe new additions - or all that I've seen so far - are all to the good, if fairly minor. The hero skill progression is interesting. Combat wise, they've added in cover to the battlefields and flanking. There's a "local guard" added to castles, a fixed defence force you cannot remove, not too strong but decent. World map boosters last multiple battles.\n\nCampaign and story, I like it.\n\nOverall.. especially if you're a Heroes fan, go for it.\n\n","September 30, 2015","true","57.3"," 12 of 34 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","12","34","0","0"

They should have used the "Unity" engine for better in-game menus as the palette used is rather bland.  Would even say it looks a mess.\n\nAlso it is very odd with the main war screen having chars there that are not animated at all when they speak, yet its all in a 3d enviroment, the candles move and the screen scrolls around the  3d chars but no movement with them just the voices.  Did the main animator leave the company before they finished the game? All the char pics are either non moving puppets or 2d pics, a bit of a miss with todays tech level.\n\nI will still recommend this game as its still a "Might and Magic" game but like so many games released looks like the skill level of devs/animators/Logic is far lower than what it used to be, to many rose coloured specs wanting to make millions with there console/phone programming lack of skills.

Necromancers are back as they should be - raising skeletons (and banshees) from the dead enemies, dragons are back (You now usually have a choice of last-tier unit) and the graphic style is a heavily modernized version of what you saw in III and Dark Messiah. The skill trees are more similar to the ones in HoMM V - which was the best in the series in that regard, I think - but it's not without ideas of its own.\n\nThe graphics look good, but my GFX 780 is struggling a bit at very high, but it's not bad. The graphic style is, for me, very good, they've  rolled back the 'reinvention' they did in #6.\n\nThe interface has a few problems - you can't see the stats of your hero while choosing what to upgrade from goodie huts, which is the most direct complaint I have.\n\nThose things aside, I was greatly enjoying my first few hours in the game, and I suspect we'll be friends for quite a while. :)\n\nPS: I don't know anything about MP aspects, as they do not interest me.","September 29, 2015","true","24.9"," 13 of 37 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","13","37","0","0"

Now known as, I guess, "Might & Magic (trademark) Heroes (trademark)" (sigh). If you are new to this franchise...stop reading right now and go download Heroes 3 complete for a few bucks on gog.\n\nAnyways, I sort of recommend Heroes 7, at least to fans of 5. I had an okay time. Thumbs up for not being Heroes 6!\n\nHeroes 2 was the first game I ever really loved as a kid. I have more hours in Heroes 3 than any other game ever. I didn't care for the direction of 4, I thought 5 was pretty enjoyable, and 6 is DEAD to me.  Heroes 7 is very reminiscent of 5.  It is a step back in the right direction for this franchise, I think, but by no means a classic, and I will be back to playing 3 soon.\n\nPROS:\n*Talent trees have some pretty nifty abilities and actually seem to matter again\n*Beautiful home castle screens\n*Multiple kinds of resources\n*Return to more "old school" factions from V\n*Interesting flanking tactics added\n*Uplay still lurks in the background and I get spammed with game ads everytime I close the game, but the horrid separate Uplay login from VI is gone\n\nCONS:\n*Buggy and crashes (10/17/2015)\n*Not very many single player scenarios outside of the campaigns (woo DLC?)\n* I love the campaigns in the older games in part because I can level up a few carefully-selected heroes from scratch into my own customized squad of killing machines over multiple scenarios. In Heroes 7, I keep on getting handed new pre-leveled heroes in each scenario that I don't particulalry care about.\n*I really didn't know it was possible to ragequit Heroes. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to add so many "find this secret without any hints!" and "have two heroes step on all of these switches at the same time without any hints!" gimmicks to a turn-based, time/day-based campaign...WITH a time limit...but...stop it.\n*Quick combat - can't use it in any enemy hero battles. This makes killing trivial heroes, and defending forts that have no chance of winning, boring.","October 17, 2015","true","51.8"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","8","27","0","0"

It's not executed perfectly, but they have listened over the years in going back to their roots. Moreover, they've made some of the options that we've been screaming for more standard such as the ability to restart battles or encounters without having to exit and reload a savegame.\n\nYes it needs plenty of bug fixes, I get it. If you only play games that are "perfect" at release then avoid this. And if that's the only basis for a negative review, then it's a shallow review.

It's a conservative installment of the franchise, but all the little things are "done right" which I've felt was lacking in heroes V and VI.   For example, while hovering your mouse over a guy you want to attack, you see where he can move shaded out, so you know exaclty where to place a unit so he can't reach you, likewise, you get coverage details if you're moving a unit behind a rock or what not.  The campaigns, it tracks where you are in each campaign quite nicely so you're not stuck with finishing one campaign before you start another if you like to try out each faction first like me.  They added neat little ideas like warcries for the warrior classes, metamagics for the wizards, and some wicked ♥♥♥ spells (tsunami was like holy ♥♥♥♥) and the sound effects and music are pretty good.  It has a lot in this game, but not so much that it turns you off which I felt made Heroes VI suffer.\n\nI was hesitating to buy this because of all the negative reviews, but they seem to be trash reviews because of bugs and stuff which I haven't had a problem with (and I'm saying this after the patch).

It is exactly what you have whined and yelled that you want. Heroes 3 type graphics and pallete of colours. I also saw some morons complaining about the 2d town screens. Again, as the majority wanted, very Heroes 3 like.\nMusic, as always in a Heroes game, is sublime, way to go Romero.\nGameplay is good, they tried to go back to the roots, as in the past the plebea has complained of any inovation attempt. Campaigns are trying to break away from "this is your castle, now kill all the other players" which is a good thing, you have skirmish maps for that.\nSome superficial idiots complained about the cut scenes. Well, I am sooo happy they went with this solution than with what they did previously. I would rather have still images than the mess of animation for cut scenes in Heroes 5, made with the game engine that looked hideously and moved their mouths like fish freshly pulled out of the water. If you can't do a great job then don't do it, go arround it, and thats what they have done.\nI also love the in game menus in Heroes 7, colours and the feel of the spells book, the portraits of the heroes and so on. Again, Heroes 5 sucked big time at this chapter.\n\nEveryone screams BUGS! I am not saying there are no bugs, it's just that I didn't encounter them, and I played  one campaign, now in the middle of the second one. I also played the beta and that was a buggy mess, but the final release seems okay up till now.\n\nCons:\n\nThey did not have a breakthrough like they did when they released Heroes 3, if that can be called a fault. And nobody does these days. The difference between computer games generations is getting smaller and smaller as are the steps towards visible, shocking improvements.\nAlso, I am not crazy about the wheel type of the hero specialization. It seems a little weird, but I am getting used to it. I am sure they could have found a different, better solution to that.\n\nI cannot comment on the AI, but all heroes games besides 2 and 3 sucked at AI. Let's hope this will also be an exception.\nI forgot to mention that I hate the influence of japanese style graphics on some of the creatures. I mean the archangel should look like a dam archangel, not some asian legless, faceless emo teen with a long robe, sleeves and ribbons flying "graciously" around. I really miss the archangel from Heroes 3 with western type drawings. It looked more biblical, less cartoony, giving him a more dramatic feeling.\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8,6/10.","October 4, 2015","true","22.9"," 11 of 37 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","11","37","0","11"

No bugs for me, sounds just like it should.\n\nTo people complaining about Uplay ; grow the hell up. Are you really buying Ubisoft games and complaining that they're Ubisoft games? Really!? "Well I bought this game from Ubisoft but it turns out it's from Ubisoft so I don't like it".

I was one of the folks who pre-ordered but ended up refunding. I was disappointed in how badly they messed up one of my favorite franchises. I don't think anyone will dispute that the game was in no shape to be released and shouldn't have been, especially for a AAA price.\n\nWith all of that said, this game has some of the most attentive developers I've seen for pretty much any game in the past couple of decades. A team that actually listens to its customers to this day and works quickly to address issues. So much so that I rebought the game.\n\nThe game is currently release worthy on the singleplayer side. I've not experienced any crashes and while there are still some bugs here and there, they are more minor and do not heavily impact the enjoyment of the game. And it is the first HOMM game in a while that redefines just enough of the mechanics to feel like a brand new game but at the same time keeps enough of the original to still be a sequel. It's quite simply a lot of fun (in contrast, I couldn't even bring myself to finish the H6 campaigns).\n\nThere are still things to be fixed but the game is currently miles apart from the atrocity at release. Make no mistake, some folks still have problems with the game. I have a reasonable powerful system and have had no technical issues. If you are on the fence because of the reviews and are getting it primarily for singleplayer, I highly recommend it. If you are getting it for multiplayer though, I can't speak to that yet as I haven't had time to try a game (it does connect a lot better than when it came out though.)\n\n\nUpdate: (2/21/2016) At this point, I think it's fair to say the community has given the dev team a lot of chances. They continue to be responsive and they continue to try to fix things. However, it seems each patch takes longer and ends up making the game more buggy. I don't understand how they can spend weeks testing a patch to release it with "no problems" only to have the community run into some very obvious problems in less than an hour (some of them you literally have to be blind not to see and are universal to all, not hardware dependant.) I am changing this review back to negative. The $60 I spent rebuying the game I will consider a loss. At this point, I don't even care anymore. I've wasted too much time on a game that might work each time a patch comes out only to be disappointed. I won't fault the dev team for not trying but I do fault them for being some of the most incompetent devs I've ever seen. Given they keep digging the hole deeper with each patch, I seriously doubt this game will ever see the day where it runs perfectly. I am done with this and will also stop following the discussion board.","November 9, 2015","false","151.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple as that. In all the years I have used Steam, this was the first time ever I asked for a refund. The game is very pricey, and feels unfinished. The graphics are very bland and uninspired, the combat sounds are awful, the music isn't good (something HOMM serie always got right), the 3D models on the main campaign table look really ugly and unfinished, and there are no animations for them. The game as a whole just felt really boring.\n\nNow a bit more personal; I disliked the factions and their creature distribution. I don't know why they had to make dungeon associated with dark elves and sylvan associated with elves. Just look at HOMM 2 and 3 titles and you'll see that those two factions were a lot more inspired. Some units design as a whole are terrible. I don't know, it just feels like the game was rushed, they threw everything inside a big cauldron, mixed it in a senseless manner and released the product for us to buy. Everything just feels very disconnected.\n\nThe building tree UI is also bad. Looks very confusing and the townscreens could've been MUCH better. HOMM 2 and 3 townscreens were much more appealing and charming than what we got here, and they are 90's games. We are in 2015.\n\nIf this game was maybe a 20 USD title, sure, but not for the current price. Overall it just feels like a very boring game and I would wait to buy it on a 75% discount weekend or something.","October 8, 2015","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
