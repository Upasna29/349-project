The gameplay of each attraction is just a watered down version of other horror games and the sound/music used is taken right out of other games and films. The AI is random and unintelligent, seeming to have no line of sight, and only catch you when you're right next to them. The worst thing to me is not the excessive use of jump scares (which is ALL the time), but the ugly enemy designs. They look so cheap and fake that it's hard to be afraid of them. The game has some cool elements and I like the concept, but I really can't recommend it unless you really like bad jump scares.","March 9","false","0.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dna4ever42/recommended/424260/","dna4ever42","Alex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dna4ever42/","93 products in account","I cannot recommend this game. It is the first game for quite some time I regret buying...\n\nPro:\n- Some Graphics, due to Unreal 4 middleware/engine\n- Cool fireworks at the beginning\n\nKind of neutral:\n- Not complete, only 3 levels available, and in-game announcements for 3 more levels\n- It is a "collection" of non-entangled mini-games/levels\n\nContra:\n- Very bad english translation\n- Bad programming, eg. missing or jumpy animations ... if any\n- Ugly level design, badly aligned walls, big squared blocks as buttons...\n- In game advertisement for portugese youtuber/podcaster?? Very good for the mood...\n\nOne Level is quite adventurous, i liked it (Black Hole), the Dark Room level is just plain jump scare stuff in one room, hence the name, and the hospital level is a joke. It is so complicated still uninteresting to play. I made an animated png with the desciption how to play it :)\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/133541/playing%20manual.png\n\nMaybe the game gets better over time, but I cannot imagine installing it again in the future. Sorry, there are other very good indy horror games out there...\n\n\n","March 27","false","2.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I must have spent over 20 min just to find the coins since I got completely lost because everything looks identical.\nThe jumpscares are good aswell the music. However the music stops and is quiet for a long time until you enter the next area. The puzzles are ok. The dungeon stage was good and suspensfull.\nI will write about the other 2 levels later but for now this game is not recomended.\n\nPro\nJumpscares\nMusic (While is actually on)\nGraphics\n\nCon\nBlack hole level is a mess.\nNot optimized I have a 980ti but have to run medium to get 60fps.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVoz6QxbcRI","March 30","false","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilerg/recommended/424260/","kilerg","KillerG Is Magic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilerg/","211 products in account","Disclaimer: I've played one of the three currently available "attractions."\n\nI really like the idea behind this game. You're at an amusement park and each "attraction" is a mini-game of sorts. The developer has done a decent job of keeping the game updated, so I can only imagine how big this game could end up getting. I do feel like it would've benefited as being an Early Access title rather than getting a full release with only a few of these mini games to play, but at least it's still relatively cheap.\n\nSo far what I've seen is a lot of cheap jump scares. It's nice to see that in a game that's also pretty and has great atmosphere, no one seems to be doing those cheap jump scares anymore unless it's a 2D platformer or something. And the fact that the developer can create multiple different atmospheres you can jump between is pretty damn cool. But don't expect this game to be a psychological horror game, because it's not, it's more of a thriller. There are a few puzzles too, which weren't necessarily easy, but they weren't necessarily intensly difficult either.\n\nAlso I should point out again that this game is GORGEOUS. The dev built this on Unreal 4 and it really makes this game pop. The engine really helped with making the atmospheres feel believable if at times disjointed, at least in Black Hole. The audio was great, although I had trouble with music stopping sometimes if I left the area and then there would be no sound. Some of the effects for the scary portions are so strange that they're scary because you don't know what the hell they are...and for me that's good, but it may not work for you.\n\nWould I recommend you buy this now? Probably not. Would I recommend you buy this when more attractions are available? Probably. And maybe even then buy it on sale. It currently costs $8 and it's a little steep for maybe 3-4 hours of playtime, but of course there will be more later. Give it a try though, you might be surprised.\n\nThis is my first look at the game, I was playing the "Black Hole" attraction:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t38w04CB16Q","March 25","true","1.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I feel like this game is very unpolished and the bad grammar takes you out of the experience.  It relies on cheap jumpscares too much.  I would say this game is worth 2 bucks not 7.","April 5","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The entire game is jumpscares (Cheap ones, at that), and the audio doesn't make sense in several areas of the game. Overall, it's not worth $7. It might be worth $1 or $2. If you think you might want it, you can see the Let's Play down below for the basic gameplay it has to offer.\n\nORIGINAL:\nI haven't played much of this game (as you can see) but it's definitely appealing for some reasons:\n\n1) The level design is colorful, strange, and well executed\n2) Yes, every scare I've encountered has been a jump scare, but those get me. And I like them :P\n3) While it does cost money, it's cheap, and it seems to have a good bit of content for just an "average indie horror game"\n\nIf you want to see some of the game before you play it, I made a YouTube video of it. Check it out if you want:\nhttps://youtu.be/kosge6MG5Hg","March 9","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I don't think so. I would maybe pay $2-3 for it in it's current state, but definitely not $7.\n\nGraphics: 5/10 - It looks ok, but there is a lot of screen tearing when turning and some of it just looks out of place as well.\n\nSound: 5/10 - Some of it sounds very good, but again, some of it is just very out of place.\n\nGameplay: 3/10 - Not very good. It's basically a game with multiple mini-games; a FNAF spinoff, a few puzzles, and a tour of a hospital. But what really hurts this score is the broken english in all of the directions, which just makes it hard to understand the objectives of each mode.\n\nAtmosphere: 5/10 - There are some moments when I would actually feel scared, but after a little while I was completely aware of when something was going to happen.\n\nScares: 2/10 - Just not scary after the first few jumpscares, and that is all the game has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 9","false","1.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Yes.\nDo they work on me? Yes.\nDid I enjoy the game? Yes.\n\nThe game has a cool concept, as you go through each attraction as if it were a "Haunted House" type of attraction. They are all disconnected from eachother, and there is no story line. Each one has fresh scares and I found the game to be fun. Think of going to a theme park full of haunted houses.\n\nWhy the negative review then!?\n\nI liked Dark Room and Black Hole, but Terror in the Hospitol is GOD AWFUL. The puzzle is so broken. You need to do 5 steps, then repeat the process 3 times. The problem is that with the coins system, you will die. And die. And die. And die. Having to restart from the beginning each time. Doing the process once is hard enough, BUT THREE!? On top of it, I've fallen through the map twice in this attraction. I think you will need to beat all three attractions to move on to the new ones, and if that's the case, I'll never play the new ones, because I've completely given up on the Hospital one.\n\nI really liked the game up until this. Hopefully the developer fixes the 3rd attraction, because it's pretty rage ensuing as is.","March 31","false","3.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"
