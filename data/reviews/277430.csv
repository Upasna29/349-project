Hopefully the first of many more! I'm a huge fan of Halo and when I first heard of this game coming to Steam I got excited.  The game is only 5 dollars which is a great price for the content it provides. Does the game run smoothly? Well yes! The movement is spot on and the keyboard/mouse controls are well done. So I love the controls, the gameplay, the price, and the content the game brings us in general. But, there are a few things I don't like about it. I don't like the video settings. They are very lacking for a PC game. The options are Resolution, Anti-Aliasing, and the refresh rate. And I wished it was Multiplayer. Maybe co-op; that would be very fun. But besides all of that, I think the game is great and worth the price!","April 4, 2014","true","3.1"," 654 of 754 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","654","754","0","22"

And yes this is a mobile port.\n\nNow that part's out of the way, Halo: Spartan Assault is a fun little top-down twin-stick shooter and it's a great deal for its already low price (and an even better deal during one of the frequent 75% off sales). It's short, but I don't really see that as a downside, personally. As someone with a fairly short attention span at times (like the times when I am awake), I like that Halo: SA is a game that I can pick up and run through a level in a few minutes.\n\nThe graphics are nice, particularly since this started in the mobile sphere. I played using an Xbox 360 controller and I didn't find the controls awkward at all, though it did take a few missions for me to get the hang of things. The music's also really good. The story is pretty basic, but you're a recruit in training in some sort of Halo universe thingie, and you are using the game to re-enact the historic battles of some heroic spartan assault in some futuristic past. Probably this all makes great sense if you're already a Halo fan. What you get is a nice little series of missions in which you are some kind of badass futuristic soldier tasked with clearing enemies, escorting vehicles, holding strategic points, destroying heavy weapons, etc.\n\nThe enemies, weapons, power-ups, and the missions themselves are all varied enough that it keeps things interesting as you progress through the 30 or so levels. Surprisingly, there's also quite a bit of replayability, whether it's trying to get gold stars on each mission, going for all the achievements and medals, attempting missions with the "extra credit" parameters, farming for XP to buy upgrades, or playing with various handicaps (skulls) turned on.  In addition, once you factor in the muliple difficulty levels and the ability to compare your scores to those of your Steam friends, you can easily play through several times.\n\nAdd nice Steam integration features (trading cards, achievements, leaderboards) and the only reason not to get this one is (apparently, judging from the negative reviews and threads I see) if you are too busy crying that Micro$oft didn't put the Halo game you really wanted to play on Steam.","January 18, 2015","true","3.7"," 117 of 126 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","117","126","11","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/recommended/277430/","StarSide","Psychedelic Adventurer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/","422 products in account","Tl'dr version:\nA fun and responsive top down shooter. Bizarre design choices and a weak story does not stop me whole heartedly recommending this game to anyone who likes this kind of thing. If you're a Halo fan you probably already own this. I would however advise buying this on a sale if you can help it as the games replay value is limited.\n\nNow if MS would hurry up and get Halo over here on pc, that would be nice.\n\n\n\nElaborated version:\nHalo Spartan Assault is a isometric top down shooter brought to you by 'Vanguard games', who holds reasonable pedigree, as they made the well received title 'Gattling Gears', another top down shooter.\nOriginally made for Windows Phone, then ported over to Windows 8, then to both generations of Xbox consoles, then finally to Steam, which means it will run on anything. Basically you'll find this title on virtually any reasonbly current gen platform you can find.\n\nFrom the very start, you can tell this is a ported mobile game almost instantly. Giant menu buttons and a small array of graphical and audio options are not unexpected for these types of game. However it doesn't make it any more excusable. This stuff does not belong on pc and, where I can forgive a smaller company the lack of attention to detail, this is f***ing Microsoft and Co!\n\nControlling your Spartan is easy. WASD keys will move your guy around, while aim and shoot with the mouse. Pretty simple. Everything here feels tight and responsive. Quite an achievement for a top down shooter, where many a time you'll find yourself struggling to control a slow and unresponsive character.\nGameplay wise, this is about as good as you're going to get out of this genre. Good stuff!\n\nGraphically, the game is very pleasing to the eye. It's by no means going to win awards. But it definitely has it's own style and charm to it. Everything here feels like Halo. Plasma grenades explode with a satisfying buzz Halo players will no and love, while the chatter of different weapons all feel hefty and interesting. One of Halo's greatest strengths is its weapons variety and while it does taught some of the best weapons from the game, I was slightly disappointed they didn't include more weapon variety.\nAlso, due no doubt to this being originally a Mobile game, some weapons are extraordinarily overpowered (The automatic rocket launcher for example) This completely breaks the tactical nature of the game, and really only limits you to a few weapons which you'll either start with at the beginning of the level, or by unlocking them XP points. None of the guns enemies drop are worth anything. And they'll more than likely get you killed if you attempt to use them on harder difficulties.\n\nThis brings me to another strange design choice the game has. Instead of paying for an advantage, on console and desktop versions of the game, you can simply buy OP weapons with XP points you earn by repeating levels. This to me, feels sloppy and hurried. Maybe I was expecting too much, but it would have been cool to have some kind of progression system to unlock more guns. It would have lengthened the games longevity somewhat also.\n\nThe story here is about as by the numbers as you'll get. Rookie Spartan Sara Palmer gets into trouble with the covenant. Davis, and her fight back and win the day. Pretty standard stuff. This is by no means going to make you fall in love with the Halo lore if this is your first outing of Halo. Which it very well might be,given MS's track record of releasing Halo games on PC.\n\nOne massive, and rather nonsensical issue I have with the game however is that MS has actually made the decision to strip the CO-OP mode out of the game entirely. Unless you own the game on Xbox One, (which I do) you wont be able to play with friends. Aside from the insanely short sighted design decision to rip pieces out of the game so the Next gen port would look more favorable, I can't think of single reason to do this. This severely hurt the games fun factor as two players really makes this one of the best top down shooters out there.","November 13, 2014","true","37.3"," 161 of 187 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","161","187","10","10"

It has the same atmosphere and the same graphic and artistic direction, making it a real Halo game.\n\nThese being said, the game is actually designed for mobile touch enabled devices and the first thing that gives it away is the missions length that never reaches 10 minutes. In fact, you can finish most of the missions in less than 5 minutes(if you're good enough), making Halo: Spartan Assault the first casual game in this series.\n\nThe story is interesting and it's written in such a manner that can justify the moments when the game gets really hard.\n\nThe game features and experience system that allows you to buy new weapons and abilities. You can get XP points only based on the enemies you kill and the manner you kill them. This way you can earn the Bronze/Silver/Gold star or none (this means no XP points). You can also select 2 out of 6 skulls to make the game harder but gain more XP points.\n\nThe game is really enjoyable but unfortunately it has some serious issues.\n\nThere are moments the game feels so scripted and cheap that you really want to ditch it.\n\nThe default weapons set usually feels useless so you have to pick your own custom ones. However this requires a lot of XP points and force you to pick up skulls. This makes the game harder but frustrating and cheap.\n\nWhile the Covenant troops have no problem in controlling the vehicles, you struggle to.\nWhile the need 1-3 grenades to blow up their own vehicles when you are driving them, you need 3-5 at least to do the same thing with the same vehicles. While they can blow up you vehicle really fast with mounted turrets without stopping from shooting, you need more shots and time to do it and you also have to stop firing since the turrets magically start overheating when you use them.\nAnd you also need more grenades to blow up the turrets when the enemy uses it than they need for when you are using it.\n\nAll those aspects make some missions so hard that you have to keep on trying to finish them. Sometimes you need to replay old missions to get XP points so that you can afford the right set of weapons and abilities since you waste all those points trying to figure the right set out, making a 5 minutes mission feel like a 30 minutes repetitive hell and a very bad way to make a game feel longer than it really is.","April 19, 2015","true","8.1"," 69 of 80 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","69","80","4","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noble_Spartan/recommended/277430/","Noble_Spartan","Noble Spartan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noble_Spartan/","54 products in account","I'd say that this was a good run. It really made me spend some hours into this game, especially as a Halo fan.\n\nHalo: Spartan Assault is a Top-Down Shooter that is a "prequel?" to Halo: Spartan Strike, and as noticed by the gameplay, it is significantly different from all the other Halo First Person Shooters you all know in love. But it is still considered a Halo game in my standards and it definitely deserves some recognition.\n\nAs with the story, you play as the characters that are seen in Halo 4, Spartan Palmer and Spartan Davis. As it takes place before the events of Halo 4, you're met with a series of missions in each specific Operation. There are 5 missions in each Operation and there are a total of 6 Operations altogether. Depending on your pacing of the game, it may take you less than a day up to a couple of days at the most to complete this game, depending if you're getting the achievements or not.\n\nLots of things return from the previous Halo games along with other stuff that are non-existant in Halo: Spartan Assault. One of the most famous things to return is the Armor Abilities. Along with the previous ones returning such as the Active Camoflage, the Autosentry, and Sprint also returns as an Armor Ability. Besides the old ones, there are new Armor Abilities that can be very effective and sometimes overpowered. The Overshield is one of the most overpowered Armor Abilites you can have in the game.\n\nSome of the beloved vehicles return from Halo Wars as well. The Grizzly is the only vehicle from Halo Wars that is drivable, the others like the Hawk, Wolverine, and even the Elephant are just there for asthetics.\n\nNo Battle Rifle or some other fan loved weapons don't exist. :(\n\nIn my opinion, Halo: Spartan Assault had more replayablility than it did on Halo: Spartan Strike. Even after you finish the game, you still had to do some of the Spartan Ops that are available in every mission, but the only difference is that the Spartan Ops in Spartan Assault made you do more work than in Spartan Strike, sometimes having you to replay that mission more than once and making it tedious just to complete that specific Spartan Op. But after completing them all and earning all the achievements, it really does make you feel like you've achieved something after all that hours you put into (That is, if you're planning to do that).\n\nProbably the only bad parts of this game are the sometimes tedious Spartan Ops and no multiplayer for this version. Since only the Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions have multiplayer, it should be fair that the PC version should get multiplayer as well in my opinion.\n\n$5 is worth it in my opinion and it's $1 cheaper than Halo: Spartan Strike, so you're basically geting more bang for your buck for this game. I know the gameplay isn't everybody's cup of tea, but you should still try this, Halo fan or not. If you're not convinced, then this game contains trading cards and Halo theme backgrounds and emoticons that some or most Halo fans want (Including myself).\n\nIn conclusion, Halo: Spartan Assault is a very decent Top-Down Shooter as it stands for most Halo fans and everyone else to try.\n\nShould you buy this game?As a Halo fan, you should! Looking for some decent games or getting into Halo? Give both Spartan Assault and Spartan Strike a try. Or you could just wait for this game to go on sale if that suits your tastes.\n9.5/10\n\nHalo: Spartan Strike Review if that's what you're looking for:\n\nIf you liked this review, feel free to join my Steam Curator Group, Spartan Crew (Noble).","January 23","true","47.3"," 49 of 50 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","49","50","4","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laggyteabag/recommended/277430/","laggyteabag","laggyteabag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laggyteabag/","404 products in account","Halo Spartan Assault is average at best. The game looks very much like the mobile game in which it is ported from, and it feels like one too. The game lacks full rebindable keys, and the game feels all in all very clunky to play, especially when driving human vehicles such as the Scorpion MBT using the keyboard.\n\nMissions can last anywhere between 2-6 minutes in length, and they offer very little in terms of replayability or variety, generally consisting of "Get to objective X", "Kill X amount of targets", or "Defend X for Y amount of time". Each mission begins with a loadout screen where you can select your loadout which consists of a primary weapon, secondary weapon, armour ability and power up (not active by default), however you may only change your loadout by spending your in-game currency (XP), but there is no need to do so as the game is very easy without such purchases, as there are many other weapons, vehicles and stationary cannons scattered around each level that keep you stocked up long enough to complete the mission with very few issues.\n\nThe story is very basic, and your average Halo fare: A human planet is under attack by covenant forces, lo and behold: the forerunners seems to have had a foothold on the planet before they died out, and then the UNSC and the Covenant duke it out to try and reclaim whatever technology they left behind, and to stop the Covenant from destroying humanity etc etc. It is not going to be the most memorable story, or even memorable at all, but what makes it worse is that missions are explained with a small block of text, and cutscenes are reserved for the completion of each ‚ÄúOperation‚Äù (every 5 missions), these cutscenes, whilst nice to look at with their graphic novel style presentation, only last a few seconds, and do little to break up the monotony of the combat.\n\nGraphically the game is very impressive for a mobile port. DX effects are squeezed in to make explosions look fairly impressive, as well as cramming in a large amount of particle effects such as embers and snowflakes which all make the game look alive. The lighting and background effects (post Operation C) are also very nice to look at as it obtains every bit of colour that Halo is known for, a refreshing break from the flurry of grey/ brown games that we are so very accustomed to seeing now. One huge downside however is the lack of graphics options past AA, resolution and refresh rate. Where are the texture options? V-Sync? Or even a colourblind mode?\n\nThe sound design is very good though, the weapons sounds are taken directly from the Halo console games and thus are of a high quality (although they do sound a little muffled), and whilst the original music composed by Tom Salta (Halo: CEA) is very good, the music feels like it is implemented incorrectly, as the music that often accompanies combat is very calm and whimsical, not the epic music that I would expect from such a scenario (see Halo: CEA OST's "Strung"). The game feels very Halo-y in how it sounds, but it is a shame that this feeling does not carry over to the rest of the game.\n\n(As of the launch day) As expected, I did encounter a few bugs and issues during my time playing this game. I experienced a couple of crashes (which are inexcusable), as well as one irritating bug that causes the game to go into windowed mode when tabbed out, which makes this extra annoying because the options menu cannot be accessed whilst you are in the middle of a mission, and because there are no checkpoints, you will either have to finish the mission in windowed mode, or quit and start again. (There is no "Fullscreen" option in the menu, requiring the player to change the resolution of the game and then reverting it to your preferred resolution, or quitting the game).\n\nHalo: Spartan Assault is the first Halo game to reach the PC platform since Halo 2 back in 2007, but it is a shame that this is the Halo game that we got. If you are a avid Halo fan like myself, you probably already have it, but if you are on the fence about it, it might be worth the try just because of it's low price, or maybe just to convince 343i and Microsoft that the PC is a viable place to put Halo games both new and old, but otherwise, I find it hard to recommend.\n\nUPDATE: Completed in 4-5 hours, that is including mission failures as well as being AFK.\n\nNOTE: Unlike the mobile and console versions of the game, the PC version does not feature microtransactions at all, however it is painfully obvious as to where and how they were implemented. Also, the emblem, weapon and armour skin rewards for Halo 4 do not appear in the PC version of Halo: Spartan Assault.","April 4, 2014","false","4.7"," 356 of 541 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","356","541","0","38"

Weapons will be familiar to fans of previous Halo games and translate well, although they lack some of the impact you'd probably expect. There are a fair few enemy types thrown at you, from Grunts to Brutes and I was pleased to be able to stealth kill a few unaware enemies rather than always going in guns blazing.\n\nThe missions themselves are extremely short and seem to end just as things start to get interesting, which I found really ruined the flow of the game. That said, I can appreciate it works for shorter play sessions where you literally have a spare five minutes to play.\n\nBefore setting off on a mission you can choose to apply 'skulls' that increase the difficulty of the game in a variety of ways (such as removing HUD elements or making shields deplete when firing weapons). Although you can also select your weapons and equipment, it's tied into an unlock system where you spend experience points that you earn for completing missions and secondary challenges (some level specific and some weekly). Unfortunately, these unlocks only apply to the current mission you're attempting (they don't remain unlocked even if you attempt the mission again at a later date) so are all but useless in earlier missions unless you're perhaps chasing a high score. Experience Points don't come rolling in either, so you can really feel like you've wasted what you've just earned.\n\nThe levels themselves are rather similar, although are well detailed and some of the earlier missions tend to have things going on in the background to make you feel like you're in a larger conflict. The game has a fair number of not-so-invisible walls that often serve as spawn points for enemies and is a pretty linear experience, this again can be a plus for those high score getters because you'll know exactly what enemies to expect and when.\n\nHalo: Spartan Assault is not a game I'd recommend to friends and seems a bit of a let down given the setting, but if you're after an easy to play top down shooter, what's on offer is pretty fair for three and a half hours of Halo themed shootyness.","May 30, 2014","false","6.6"," 70 of 101 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","70","101","0","1"

It was a pretty fun game that can be played in bite sized chunks or all at once. Either way, there is no drop off. The game is presented in 6 chapters with 5 acts per chapter (basically). I played an act or two at a time for the most part, although I did run through the last two chapters today.\nThe gameplay is simple and intuitive. If you are familiar with the Halo universe and games, then basically, everything is the same except this is a bit pared down and of course is a top down Isometric shooter rather than the standard Halo presentation. Outside of that though, everything is basically the Halo everybody knows.\nThe difficulty is something you can scale yourself via in game options during the mission set ups. Experience points are used to purchase different weapons and shield upgrades pre mission as well as action augmentation (improved damage, shields, or experience).\nThat is basically it. You play as two Spartans, Palmer and Davis, and each mission features one or the other, plus generally a few marines to back you up. Some missions include vehicles such as the Scorpion, but most are foot missions, although you might pick up vehicles or use turrets along the way.\n\nAll in all, I thought the game merited 8 out of 10, especially since it was obviously designed to be a mobile game first (at least, so it seems to me).","July 18, 2014","true","6.0"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

I've played Halo 3 since december 2008 and I played it untill the very last day I played anything on my Xbox 360 back in late 2012. That's four years of playing Halo 3 almost every single day. Needless to say but Halo was definately one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had, period. Fans and gamers alike have been waiting (begging, even) for Halo on Steam. Thus far the PC has only seen Halo 2 for Windows, but never before has a Halo-game been released on Steam. Until now, that is.\nHalo: Spartan Assault makes its entry to Steam as the very first (and hopefully not the last) Halo game ever to be released on it. Coming at a steal of only 5$ you get a complete Halo experience that is not only a fun Halo game, but also a great twin-stick shooter, offering quite a lot of content with endless replayability.\n\nThe Good:\n¬∑ Solid controls allow for intense firefights set on beautiful locations filled with authentic Covenant enemies (like Grunts, Jackals and Elites).\n¬∑ The Challenge System is back from Halo: Reach and Halo 4, bringing you more challenges several times a week. This adds a huge replay-value. One challenge may have you completing a level with at least one skull enabled, while another one will have you killing 200 Grunts with Assault Rifles in Operation B. Each challanges gives you additional experience to compete against your friens (and foes, if you're the competetive kind) in the leaderboars.\n¬∑ The story, albeit quite forgetful, is a prequel to Halo 4s Spartan Ops mode without ever attaching too much to it. It's a story of its own that introduces new and old characters to the audience. Beautiful art-styled cinematics and gorgeous environments are a treat to look at and a blast to play though.\n\nThe Bad:\n¬∑ No co-op or multiplayer. While the singleplayer offers a high challenge and huge replayability, the lack of co-op or multiplayer is rather disappointing. Gunning through the missions with a friend could on its own offer even more replayability, and the multiplayer could soak up hours of gameplay of Halo- and twin-stick-fans alike.\n¬∑ It's not Halo 3, Halo: Reach or Halo 4, but it's still fantastic to have a Halo game on PC.\n\nThe Ugly:\n¬∑ Stunning cinematics with solid gameplay set on gorgeous and varying planets make this game just as much fun to watch as it is to play it. Add authentic Covenant enemies and iconic Halo guns and this game makes for a gorgeous wet dream for any Halo fan on PC.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n¬∑ If you love twin-stick shooters, get it. If you love Halo, get it. If you love games with high replayability, get it. For a 5$ price tag, Halo: Spartan Assault brings you a high-quality twin-stick Halo shooter that will have you coming back and replaying every single mission long after you've completed the main story. 9/10.","April 5, 2014","true","4.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Albeit the crummiest, most god-forsaken half ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• release of the franchise I cannot bring myself to call it a bad game.

Either way, I‚Äôm pretty damn happy with the $5.00 I spent acquiring this fairly respectable game. Whilst in no way does it do the franchise any justification or could even sit amongst the many flawless titles that have been released over the last 14 years, I‚Äôm happy to have it in my steam library and I‚Äôm pleased by the trading card support that includes some great art-work which keeps the universe alive and cements its place on the PC platform.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/277430/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","For a good number of gamers, the Halo franchise is synonymous with the Xbox name. After all, the first Halo helped launch the console and made it a hit in a PS2-dominated space. Halo 2 helped solidify Xbox Live as the premiere place for online gaming on a console. The thought of an Xbox console without a new Halo game is unfathomable. Microsoft saw fit to give an older Halo title to satisfy fans. Halo: Spartan Assault is a fine title. It just isn't what people were expecting.\n\nSet in a time period between Halo 3 and Halo 4, Halo: Spartan Assault doesn't have you taking on the role of the famous Master Chief. Instead, you take on the roles of both Spartans, Davis and Palmer, at the outpost on Draetheus V and its moon, X50. The outpost is under attack from a Covenant force that has ignored the peace treaty and gone rogue. You repel enemy forces to prevent them from uncovering old Forerunner technology, which can be used to destroy planets.\n\nThe tale certainly holds more significance if you pay attention to the franchise lore outside of video games. The heroes in this title play significant roles in the novels and such. What you get are the highlights of an important battle, rather than a fully fleshed-out tale. Aside from animated storyboards that bookend the chapters, most of the tale is told in text boxes that precede each mission, and even that doesn't do much beyond explaining the events that preceded the mission. Part of the reason for this is because you're essentially playing a program aboard the UNSC ship Infinity that uses the battle as tactical training for Spartans during their off-time. It is an interesting framing device, but it makes it feel like a throwaway story since it doesn't try to tie into the other games.\n\nSpartan Assault marks the second official time the Halo franchise has veered away from the first-person perspective. This time, the game features a top-down perspective and a dual-stick system to deliver the shots. The game retains mechanics, like a two-gun limit and an ammunition count for each firearm, forcing people to think about their shots during firefights instead of spamming the area with bullets. It also has skulls, a mechanic introduced in Halo 3, which give you handicaps for each level, like turning off your HUD or forcing you to become more vulnerable during attacks.\n\nThe shift in perspective also brings with it a gameplay shift, as the title is less grounded in story and has more of an arcade focus. You won't see points flying above each Covenant member you kill, but you have a persistent on-screen score counter during fights. You also have familiar badges, like Double Kill, Killimanjaro and Wrecking Ball that act as point multipliers, which are essential when you're trying to achieve three-tier star rankings for each level to gain more XP.\n\nFor the most part, the levels can be broken down into three different disciplines. Some levels have you hunting specific targets, with or without a time limit. Others are escort missions, and some levels require you to hold down your position until help arrives. No matter what, the missions rarely deviate from a given task, and instead of combining them into one giant quest, the game sets this up as 30 different levels.\n\nAs far as the core game goes, it isn't a bad shooter. The mechanics of the Halo universe work very well here, though there is a heavy emphasis on on-foot action over vehicles. The arena style of environment keeps the game focused on combat more than exploration, a point punctuated by the relatively small size of each arena and the lack of secret areas. Giving it an arcade slant means that weaponry is abundant, so you'll rarely have a moment when guns aren't being fired. In short, it works as well as expected.\n\nGraphically, Spartan Assault is good. The environments emulate the Halo aesthetic quite well, with the familiar war-torn bases and barren battlefields meshing well with the colorful alien flora and fauna. The figures are now diminutive in size, but you can easily tell the difference between a brute, a grunt, and every other enemy in between. Their accompanying animations are done rather well, and particle effects are rather minimal. Things like explosions and the aura of the moon's and planet's energy sources are reflected rather well.\n\nSound has never been an issue with the Halo series, and this one isn't looking to buck the trend. The effects are classic Halo, as is the music, which isn't done by the original composer, though his influence is certainly noticeable. They're all well done, but some seem to play at inopportune times, like a sad piece playing during the tail end of an intense firefight. The voices are fine, but the lines from your accompanying soldiers can get repetitive.\n\nAs long as your expectations are tempered, Halo: Spartan Assault is a serviceable game. It works as a top-down shooter, but you'll miss the enemy intelligence of the older games. The bite-sized missions can be good, but unfortunately, that means the whole game amazingly short.

It has the same atmosphere and the same graphic and artistic direction, making it a real Halo game.\n\nThese being said, the game is actually designed for mobile touch enabled devices and the first thing that gives it away is the missions length that never reaches 10 minutes. In fact, you can finish most of the missions in less than 5 minutes(if you're good enough), making Halo: Spartan Assault the first casual game in this series.\n\nThe story is interesting and it's written in such a manner that can justify the moments when the game gets really hard.\n\nThe game features and experience system that allows you to buy new weapons and abilities. You can get XP points only based on the enemies you kill and the manner you kill them. This way you can earn the Bronze/Silver/Gold star or none (this means no XP points). You can also select 2 out of 6 skulls to make the game harder but gain more XP points.\n\nThe game is really enjoyable but unfortunately it has some serious issues.\n\nThere are moments the game feels so scripted and cheap that you really want to ditch it.\n\nThe default weapons set usually feels useless so you have to pick your own custom ones. However this requires a lot of XP points and force you to pick up skulls. This makes the game harder but frustrating and cheap.\n\nWhile the Covenant troops have no problem in controlling the vehicles, you struggle to.\nWhile the need 1-3 grenades to blow up their own vehicles when you are driving them, you need 3-5 at least to do the same thing with the same vehicles. While they can blow up you vehicle really fast with mounted turrets without stopping from shooting, you need more shots and time to do it and you also have to stop firing since the turrets magically start overheating when you use them.\nAnd you also need more grenades to blow up the turrets when the enemy uses it than they need for when you are using it.\n\nAll those aspects make some missions so hard that you have to keep on trying to finish them. Sometimes you need to replay old missions to get XP points so that you can afford the right set of weapons and abilities since you waste all those points trying to figure the right set out, making a 5 minutes mission feel like a 30 minutes repetitive hell and a very bad way to make a game feel longer than it really is.","January 9, 2015","true","82.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Unfortunately, it's a port of the mobile game which happens to be more of an top-view action game instead of a first person shooter. Does that make Spartan Assault any less good ? Yes and no.\n\nThe universe is there, and the atmosphere oozes Halo, it's just a bit less detailed. Same goes for the enemies.\n\nThe controls also could've been implemented better but once you get the hang of them they'll do just fine. Controlling vehicles is awkward, though and it takes much more than a little bit of practice. By the end of the game I still wasn't able to drive a vehicle without crashing into something.\n\nYou can tell the game was designed for mobile phones because the missions are ridiculously short. And yet some of them are pretty hard. There are 6 campaigns, and each campaign consists of 5 levels, making a total of 30 levels. A level will take you 5-10 minutes to finish. So there's just a couple of hours of gameplay here. Objectives range from defending an area to killing every alien or blowing stuff up. The mission variety is what keeps the game fun because if I had to shoot my way through every level I probably would've stopped halfway through.\n\nAnyway, Halo Spartan Assault is really a game for the action genre and Halo lovers. It's definitely fun in short bursts, but it's not the Halo game we originally wanted or hoped for. Here's hoping Microsoft will someday release the 'true' Halo games. I think this one will sell pretty well nevertheless, if only because of the word 'Halo'.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","April 7, 2014","true","5.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","2"

Impossible!\nWell, apparently not. It seems Microsoft have finally opened their eyes to the potential of selling on Steam now that their ill-fated foray into digital distribution failed miserably (I am of course referring to GfWL).\nSo let me start with saying this: I am not into consoles, I havent owned one since a PS2 many years back, but I am a huge Halo fan. Yeah, it sucks to be me.\n\nHalo: Spartan Assault (H:SA) is a twin-stick shooter composed of 30 short levels originally available on Win8 platforms & devices, and on XBLA, primarily designed to ship Windows 8 and touchscreen devices. After each set of 6 levels the player is shown a short cut scene and taken to a new area. The narrative for the game is delivered completely in this way, with nothing being revealed during gameplay itself. While the story lacks the emotion and twists & turns of the full Halo titles, it is presented in a relevant way that ties all the levels together for a game designed to be played in short spurts.\n\nH:SA doesn't look amazing, but it still managed to remain incredibly loyal to the aesthetics of Halo and every single model in the game is instantly recognisable, whether it is an enemy/human/weapon/vehicle. This ties in with the sound design literally being ripped from other Halo games as well. Everything sounds just as you would expect it to and even when combat starts to get more chaotic, you can still pick out the individual blasts and pops from each weapon. The only problem with this is that the soundtrack to the game is rather unoiriginal, and also not really thought out very well. Some of the levels are accompanied by music that simply does not suit what is happening as the sense of wonder & exploration of the other Halo games, which was aided by their incredible OSTs, is not present in all-action top-down twin-stick shooter.\n\nMy largest worry when purchasing this game was whether it was going to be a functional port. Generally mobile games do not convert very well into full PC titles, but I was pleasantly surprised that the controls are tight & responsive for this PC version when using either a gamepad, or mouse+keyboard. I had to rebind a few keyboard keys to make the controls more comfortable for myself, so it is nice that they remembered to include that as an option. The levels are each rather short, generally with 10 minutes being a long mission, but this helps break up what could become rather stagnant. Although the game has a nice variety of weapons, powers, and vehicles, the actual gameplay is not too engaging because the top-down style of the game limits the amount of ways you can approach any situation (it is pretty much always "guns-blazing", even if using a sniper rifle). Levels can be replayed at will, have score modifiers, and can even have the difficulty ramped up by using "skulls", which are essentially a choice of various handicaps, such as tougher enemies or no HUD. The game also has an XP system whereby any you have earned can be spent to buy a better weapon or power to start the next mission with. XP is earned through completing levels, set challenges, or the updated daily & weekly challenges.\n\nUsually price isn't a huge factor in buying a game, but I think I should mention that H:SA only cost me ¬£4 (I think it is $5 for N. Am). Even with the poor exchange rate on Steam's store, that is still very cheap. For me, as a Halo fan, it was a no-brainer to buy this. I got plenty of enjoyment from the game and will keep it installed for a quick fix every now & again. For a non-Halo fan I honestly don't think there is much here for you, but at that price you might consider buying it (especially when it eventually goes on Steam sale!)\n\nMy fingers are crossed for this to be the beginning of more Halo titles coming to Steam. I am not expecting more, but you never know...","April 26, 2014","true","4.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

A very good mobile to PC port. The controls were tight, gameplay was fun and reactive to what you have done via medals. The plot was decent, there was enough context there to create a meaningful story. The base mechanics are inherent of the twin-stick shooter.\n\nYou can manipulate the game's challenge/diffuiculty level via skulls that modify the play style of the game. E.g. The player only has a shield and when that is destroyed then the player dies or dropped weapons have lesser ammo. A nice twist that offers a chance for some replayability and allowing the player to get better at the game.\n\nThe enemies come in all different forms and are taken straight out of the Halo games. Watch out for the Brute Chieftan, one-hit-kill. The best enemy is the kamikaze grunt, kill him and it'll drop it's plasma grenades (hopefully raining explody plasma death on it's allies!).\n\nFor a Halo game it was really good. Of course it been a small game it was easy to get immersed into the Halo universe. I've played the original Halo trilogy on the Original Xbox and they were a stand out title. I'm very surprised Microsoft haven't released the Halo games on Steam. A FPS like Halo was meant for PC.\n\nAlso the regenerating shield makes a return, so it is possible to cower behind some rocks and suck your thumb until your shield becomes active.\n\nI don't really like giving numbered ratings (kinda cliched) but I would reccomend getting this game, especially on sale. You can play through the campaign in a few hours.","May 7","true","4.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

However, as it is not one of the main Halo flagship titles, it was easy to pass over this game without notice. So, in the end, is the game worth tracking down? Well‚Ä¶maybe if you are a hardcore Halo fan who absolutely needs to have something to fill the void until the next game is released.\n\nHalo: Spartan Assault shares only the basic skeleton work with the other titles in the series ‚Äì for one, this game is a top-down isometric twin-stick shooter. As far as the Halo universe is concerned, this actually makes for a fine fit ‚Äì it plays very much like a Halo game, but viewed from a distance. The visuals are spot-on for the Halo games as well, as there are several parts in which every visible color in the light spectrum will be present on your screen at the same time. It‚Äôs a pretty game, to be sure, and I didn‚Äôt feel as if the environments were stale or boring.\n\nGranted, that may have been because the game is very short, and you don‚Äôt spend more than five minutes in every level ‚Äì typically, even less than that. This is the result of being designed as a mobile game, in which you tend to only spend a few minutes on a sporadic schedule to only finish a mission or two. The early missions will fly by and the game does scale up the difficulty with reasonable progression. I did experience a few deaths on the later missions, but that was primarily because of my own fault of trying to rush through a level and not paying attention to my Spartan abilities or avoiding enemy fire. Enemy types aren‚Äôt particularly varied throughout, though that is typical for the Halo franchise.\n\nThe story is barely serviceable, though hardcore Halo fans will probably want a look. I had to check online to figure out that this title takes place between Halos 3 and 4, when the newest Spartan volunteer program has been implemented and the elite super-soldier unit is growing once again. The missions alternate back and forth between Spartans Palmer and Davis, although there‚Äôs no real difference between the two other than a slight visual difference with their armor color and helmets. As it is a side-story, there is very little impact here in the grand scheme of things, and the game is mostly devoid of voice acting or cutscenes ‚Äì most story information comes from in-game text before every mission, and I had to resist the urge to just skip through the handful of paragraphs that moves the story forward. Also, the game just ends without much fuss, which is disappointing.\n\nIt‚Äôs a very short, average game, but serviceable for five bucks or less. Not recommended unless you are very much invested in all things Halo ‚Äì it can be skipped otherwise.","November 10, 2014","false","3.7"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","30","50","4","2"

Granted, no one should expect amazing depth or creative storyboards out of a mobile-port game, nor intensely long missions, which is why I listed that it was a mobile port first.\n\nThat said, the graphics are pretty cool, the interface is decent and the only bug I've run into is that it seems to conflict with the Windows transparency graphics. So, you start your game, begin a mission, and about twenty seconds into it, the game will minimize and Windows will say it no longer has enough resources, which is BS, some games just make this error and it will only do it once per session. The problem is that, from that point, the game is small and windowed unless you reset the resolutions settings in the main menu. So, if you are mid-mission, it will be like that until the end. If you've spent resources on that mission because it's particularly difficult and keep failing it, you will lost those resources if you retreat to the main menu to make your game big again.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a top-down shooter, which means that being one millimeter off in your aim ends up being three million miles of difference by the time your shot reaches the edge of the screen.\n\nIt's also important to note that this game has no concept of "multiplayer" or "firefight". It's strictly highly structured missions. So it's got about fifteen hours of missions and challenges before it starts to get old.\n\nRecommended, but don't expect much, and try to get it on sale.","October 12, 2014","true","8.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The game challenges you every chance it gets and has a satisfying difficulty to augment the gameplay.The A.I suprisingly tries to flank you and uses different tactics to flush you out of cover. The brutes actually function as brutes and try to smash your body into a pulp and the grunts suicidally charge into battle with little regard for their own life.\n\nKeyboard support\nThis actually suprised me but the game functions spectacularly with mouse and keyboard. The character moves fluidly and doesn't get hung up on objects at all.\n\nCons\nVehicle Controls\nSpartan Assault features multiple vehicle sections where you can pilot tanks,speeders,and other such craft.They definitely break up the monotony of the game itself but they control so terribly that all I wanted to do was get them out of the way as quick as I possibly could. When in the Scorpion tank for example,you can only move in 8 directions in environments clearly not meant for such a control scheme.This results in you getting caught up on rocks and cover that litters the ground and making you an easy target for covenant soldiers.\n\nGraphics\nSpartan Assault plays from an isometric viewpoint and,as typical of other isometric games,has horrendous texture quality since they believe you can't see it close enough to tell. This problem plagues Spartan Assault in a particularly bad manner as there are many areas where you indeed can see the textures up close and when you do you can tell that they look abhorrent.\n\nAmount of Content\nOne of the first things you should know about Halo:Spartan Assault is that the game is short,as in 30 levels short.The game is clearly designed like a mobile game and has levels that you can complete in 5-10 minutes each. There are 6 chapters in the game and 5 levels within each chapter but seeing how quick you can complete each mission there really isn't a whole lot there.If you were wondering,there is no co-op or multiplayer mode in this game,though I feel it would be a very welcome addition and could fit well with the style of gameplay.\n\nIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming","August 23, 2015","false","7.7"," 49 of 86 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","49","86","6","0"

But nevertheless, it's a pretty fun game. Aside from the movement and steering of some vehicles, which can get a bit sketchy at times, the controls are smooth and the gameplay gives a fantastic arcade feel to Halo. Considering the depth and magnitude of the story told throughout the rest of the Halo series, the story behind Halo: Spartan Assault is somewhat monotomous and uneventful. But I get the sense this game was meant to be more of an arcade shoot-em-up instead of an epic, emotion packed story-teller, and it does quite well with that style. My only real complaint about the game is that many of the in-game challenges (Assault Ops), and the Steam achievements that rely on them, are extremely grindy. They mostly involve playing the given level several times in order to get a certain amount of kills with a specific weapon or vehicle. I would have liked to see some more variety in the challenges; perhaps more that revolve around timeliness or accuracy. But this is only really a problem if you're a completionist when it comes to achievements, so it didn't bother me too much. Despite all of the anger and ranting by Halo fans concerning the series not being brought to Steam which seems to be directed at this game, I actually really enjoyed it.. and for only 5 bucks I definitely got my money's worth! If you are considering purchasing this game, just keep in mind that it's very different from the other Halo titles and it certainly doesn't deliver the same experience. However, it is a good game and overall I would definitely recommend it.","January 13, 2015","true","9.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The only elements visible are those which are ablosolutely necessary to even play the game with some slight degree of competence.

My main bone to pick with this title is the very nature of the game; "the Halo 4 "prequel" isn't a first person shooter."\nBut, for the sake of this review, I'll look past that and judge the game on its own merits.\n\nGameplay:\nYou control your character with the typical WASD movement scheme, and "aim" with the mouse. I say "aim" because for me, it can be rather choppy at times, but it gets the job done. There are quite a few weapons, such as the Focus Rifle, (which I found rather unexpected) and there are plenty of vehicles. The vehicles handle well, as one would expect from a Halo game. Any vehicle centered missions were fun and enjoyable. Speaking of the missions, the entire game's campaign is divided into six chapters, with five missions in each chapter, making for a thirty mission total. Not bad. The missions themselves seem varied, and were quite fun to play through. They're bite-sized, and you could play through five or more in one sitting before you know it. My main complaint with the missions is the pre-game loadout screen. You can select a different weapon, armor ability, or power-up to play the mission through with, but the currency you use to buy these weapons and such pays for a temporary, one-time unlock of said item for the specific mission on which you're about to play. The system seems worthless, considering A) the price of these items and B) the short mission length, meaning you shelled out 750 XP on a Spartan Laser for nothing. Although the opportunity for micro-transactions in-game was made available, Microsoft thankfully did not take that opportunity. Overall, the gameplay is solid, but it could benefit from balancing in the loadout department, and perhaps a level editor. It's worth noting that the console version of this game has a survival mode in which you fight off hordes of the Flood, which would make a great addition to the Steam release of Halo: SA.\n\nStory:\nThe story, unfortunately, is told through small text blurbs displayed just before the mission start. I expected a larger emphasis on storytelling, but this was not the case. Sad, but it doesn't take away from the aforementioned gameplay. The story itself follows Spartans Sarah Palmer and Edward Davis as they defend planet Draetheus V from a Covenant attack and kill the commander of the particular Covenant splinter faction assaulting Draethus V: Merg Vol. The story is not a direct prequel to Halo 4, which also disappointed me.\n\nGraphics:\nIt looks alright for a top-down shooter. Obviously, with the nature of the game, they didn't need to render anything too advanced. The models themselves are somewhat low-poly, especially the world models of the weapons. The weapon world models actually could have used some touching up. I looked at an Assault Rifle laying on the ground, and it took me a few seconds to realize that the object I was staring at was, in fact, an Assault Rifle and NOT an abandoned Lego recreation of a deformed spaceship.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a fair game, especially for the appropriate $4.99 pricetag. I'd give it a 7/10. It's worth picking up if you're a Halo fan. If you're not a Halo fan but you're looking for something inexpensive to play, I suppose this wouldn't do too bad a job of holding you over.\n\nTL;DR:\nGood game, and at $4.99, it's worth buying.","June 16, 2014","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is pretty long, got enough weapons, enemies, vehicles and missions to make it worth while. It's even cought the Halo-esqe feeling with AI behaving and nice backgrounds.\nBut I can't recommend this game for anybody except genre-fans. Gameplay is repetative, upgrade system is silly and obnoxious and overall experience is not challenging or exciting in any way. There is a "skull"-system, that helps you boost the difficulty in reward of higher score (and points for upgrades), but there are too few of them, and since some doesn't affect gameplay a lot and others makes it rather unplayable - you'll find youself play with one "skull" combination the whole game.\nIf you are sick to the tears with Renegade Ops and hunger for something fresh - you could give it a try. Otherwise stick to the less forgetable games.","April 10, 2014","false","4.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

On the PC. Well it is Halo themed anyway!..\n\nHalo : Spartan Assault and Halo : Spartan Strike are twin stick shooters ported from mobile...\nhmm...\n\n\n-	The Idea	-\n\nActually, as a consumer, I don't believe there is inherently a problem with mobile ports, so long as they are a fair price and have been sufficiently upgraded to a decent standard with consideration for the platform. For example, the fact that we don't have our PCs on us when we go to the capper... at least, not all the time...\n...I can feel your judgement...\n\n-	Immediate Impressions	-\n\nHalo : Spartan Strike as well as the previous game, Halo : Spartan Assault, looks pretty good on PC actually... like surprisingly so...\nMaybe it's just because I didn't expect too much but daaaaayummm, it's a pretty sweet game graphically if it looks even remotely like that on mobile.\nOne thing that stood out to me in terms of its presentation was how you could see things moving in the background and foreground. Wraith Tanks and Grunts patrolling the streets below the bridge I was on, while Hornet gunships wizz passed followed closely by the wale of the Banshee fighter aircraft furiously firing their plasma guns. All of this creates a sense of scale. You are in a war that surrounds you and doesn't just form a tity line along your path.\n\n-     Why I Played     -\n\nThese cool tricks aside they are not exactly by any means at all games you play to get immersed in, at least that was the case for me. I enjoyed them most when I wanted to almost mindlessly play something while listening to a podcast or half watch something in the background.\n\n-     My Biases     -\n\nSo here's my situation with those games.\nI got both in a bundle during the steam summer sale for like 3 quid and as of writing I have completed Spartan Assault but have only finished 'Operation A' which is about a 6th of the way through Spartan Strike.\n\n-    The Amount of Bang    -\n\nEach level is like 2, 3 or maybe even 4 minutes long at a stretch. Be aware that I don't have a good concept of time...\nThe games themselves have a decent length to them. I have about 8 hours put into Assault but I did go back to get gold on most of the missions. Play through it once and it's like 5 hours maybe a bit less...\nI can't actually remember...\nFor what I paid, I'm happy out with that!\n\n\n-	Conclusion	-\n\nI had a sudden realisation that I'm sorta writing a blog which is not what I set out to do.\nHowever I also cannot remember what exactly I set out to do either...\nMaybe I'll just spend the rest of this review defending my choice to get a windows phone as my last mobile.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Well if you have a windows or an apple phone/tablet it is probably best to get it on something portable. It's a game that clearly had a lot of work put into it visually and the gameplay is pretty grand, even comparing it to PC games, I have played much worse.\n\nFUN FACT : the narrator during the cutscenes, Roland, is voiced by Brian T Delaney. Your man who voices the male protagonist of Fallout 4, neow‚Äô how about them apples.\n\nWhat I can definitely recommend is this video of me playing Spartan Strike for PC.\nSee what I did there?\n\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uzvzfiWioPo\n\nIt might give you a taste for the game sher! If you do decide to check it out let me know what you think, feedback is much appreciated!\nAnd just because it doesn't have a great selection of apps doesn't make the windows phone bad!...","May 9","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It has the same atmosphere and the same graphic and artistic direction, making it a real Halo game.\n\nThese being said, the game is actually designed for mobile touch enabled devices and the first thing that gives it away is the missions length that never reaches 10 minutes. In fact, you can finish most of the missions in less than 5 minutes(if you're good enough), making Halo: Spartan Assault the first casual game in this series.\n\nThe story is interesting and it's written in such a manner that can justify the moments when the game gets really hard.\n\nThe game features and experience system that allows you to buy new weapons and abilities. You can get XP points only based on the enemies you kill and the manner you kill them. This way you can earn the Bronze/Silver/Gold star or none (this means no XP points). You can also select 2 out of 6 skulls to make the game harder but gain more XP points.\n\nThe game is really enjoyable but unfortunately it has some serious issues.\n\nThere are moments the game feels so scripted and cheap that you really want to ditch it.\n\nThe default weapons set usually feels useless so you have to pick your own custom ones. However this requires a lot of XP points and force you to pick up skulls. This makes the game harder but frustrating and cheap.\n\nWhile the Covenant troops have no problem in controlling the vehicles, you struggle to.\nWhile the need 1-3 grenades to blow up their own vehicles when you are driving them, you need 3-5 at least to do the same thing with the same vehicles. While they can blow up you vehicle really fast with mounted turrets without stopping from shooting, you need more shots and time to do it and you also have to stop firing since the turrets magically start overheating when you use them.\nAnd you also need more grenades to blow up the turrets when the enemy uses it than they need for when you are using it.\n\nAll those aspects make some missions so hard that you have to keep on trying to finish them. Sometimes you need to replay old missions to get XP points so that you can afford the right set of weapons and abilities since  you waste all those points trying to figure the right set out, making a 5 minutes mission feel like a 30 minutes repetitive hell and a very bad way to make a game feel longer than it really is.\n\nEven so, with all these problems, the game is really enjoyable for a $/‚Ç¨5.\nI was however hoping that once you buy the game on Steam, to have it on WP account as well.\n\nI give it a 7.5/10 hoping that Halo: Spartan Strike won't have the same problems.","October 26, 2014","true","13.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Makes no sense from a technical standpoint.\n\nThis has a campaign of varied missions, mostly just a few minutes in length but generally pretty fun. You'll get chances to both escort vehicles and drive them yourselves, including hijacked alien vehicles. You can pick up any weapon off the ground (alien or human) and restock ammos at various lockers throughout missions.\n\nIn terms of interesting weaponry, a plasma type lets you generate energy by pressing both mouse buttons down and then "unleashing" it. The sniper rifle gives you tremendous dmg but understandably has a slow rate of fire. Different types of hand grenades are available. For better or worse, you just aim the toss with your crosshairs, and the toss (right mouse button) goes straight there.\n\nA hotkey (Q default) triggers a Special Ability. Examples are Sprint, holographic decoy, etc.\n\nYou can carry two weapons at a time and switch freely. You earn XP while playing, and you can use a "skull system," which modifies the game's difficulty level (one makes enemies more challenging, one debuffs your shield etc.) while giving you a bonus on XP-earning rate.\n\nYou can use your XP to buy upgraded weapons, along with a special ability and a passive bonus modifier (improved shield, improved dmg by weapone tc.).\n\nWhile it supports controllers, imho the keyboard/mouse default controls are excellent (and can be re-bound under options).\n\nGreat sound effects. If you play the current Early Access title Running With Rifles, you, your AI guys and the aliens are kind of like that in terms of camera view and size.\n\nI would recommend it to fans of games like:\n-Alien Swarm (minus the co-op, which again is sad)\n-Alien Breed\n-Running With Rifles\n*And just about any fan of top down and isometric type shooters. :-)","April 6, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

This view works pretty good, and isn't annoying unlike some other games with this kind of view. The levels aren't that big, but the entire game takes some time, and the ''xp'' as money system works great, so when you can't beat a level, you can use xp to buy boosts or weapons, that will make you stronger.

Thankfully, Halo: Spartan Assault is not nearly as borked, and all-in-all is a well designed game with lovely visuals and pretty graphics.\n\nBut alas, beggars cannot be choosers, and Halo PC players must do with feeding from the crumbs of Microsoft's/343's very large xbox-flavoured plate. Co-op annoyingly is non-existent, unlike the Xbox versions; and there are many annoying quirks such as lack of video options, jerky WASD movement, and lack of command line parameters. I hope for a future patch to include co-op.\n\nI do hope this will be the first of a bulk of Halo related Steam titles. Microsoft/343 would do well to port at least Halo 3 to the PC, to satisfy our 7 year lust and to let us, your loyal fans to ''finish the fight''. Gamers of Steam by and large have welcomed the release of Halo: Spartan Assault, and I for one would definitely consider buying future Steam released Halo titles.","June 11, 2014","true","31.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

This game feels really likeable and re uses the models from Halo Wars. The enemies know how to play as far as AIs go.  Also most (will  clarify in cons) feel fair and fun to use.

But take a look at screenshots and make your own opinion, really, you will see if you like it. For me it's solid 8+/10\n\nMusic: Epic. Tom Salta did great job. It fits the game, that's one thing. It won't bore you at any point of gamethrough. Bah, i myself enjoyed listening it outside the game.  10/10, 100%, A+ or whatever best rate you wish for. I'm in love in main menu theme :3\n\nOptimalisation: It works flawlessly on my year-old-and-cheap-as-heck laptop, that speaks for itself.\n\nGameplay: top-down shooter, seems similiar to Shadowgrounds, but it's kinda "faster". Short missions in which you annihilate Covenant troops and defend yours. What's interresting is XP system and challenges.\nXP let's you "buy" another weapon you start with, upgrade your shield a little and buy a boost. Everything only for duration of that one mission. XP is gained by completing missions. Simple, and works, i like that.\nChallenges makes the mission a little more difficult, but it lets you gain more XP for completion. Together with boosts it makes kinda nice combo.\n\nI am willing to rate the game with a nice and honest 9/10. Very good graphics and gameplay combined with epic music makes it very interesting game.

Mainly because I refuse to buy an Xbox, so all I knew about this game was the name tag that gets tons of hype. Granted I knew that this isn't the normal genre that Halo is best known for.\n\nIn this game you control a single soldier, you can carry two weapons and have various special abilities. I only found out about these until the last 2 chapters however. While the game is fairly short, and there is hardly any story line to it, the gameplay is somewhat addictive. I found myself being able to finish the game in one sitting. The individual levels vary between 2 minutes and 10 minutes long. The game is very fast paced and it doesn't give you chance to get bored.\n\nTowards the end of the game, I found my self being very overpowered due to the fact that I had hoarded experience points (because I didn't know how to spend them) and could use the homing explosive drone on each of the final levels, which kind of made the whole ordeal very easy and probably ruined the experience a tad.\n\nThe enemy units are all very samey, throughout the game, varying from the regular grunts who just keep pouring into you, to your beefed up melee combat commanders who will kill you in one shot.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple. Move around with WASD and aim with the mouse. The vehicle controls on the other hand left me driving into walls without knowing which way to turn around for a few seconds each time, left me very confused.\n\nYou can't ask much more of this sort of game in terms of graphics, it's a very regular decent graphics top down shooter. Nothing more, nothing less. Yes there are prettier games out there, but my gosh there are plenty worse.\n\nAll in all, I'd say pick this game up on the cheap, or if you are a fan of the Halo universe, you may get a kick out of it more than anyone.","June 22, 2014","true","3.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","13","24","2","0"

Unfortunately I found out it wasn't a multiplayer Halo, instead it was just a port of a mobile game, but I still gave it a chance. I regret doing so. This game is a extremly generic top-down shooter with halo skins and sounds added on... That's it. The story is short, lame, boring, and dull. It's just a few cutscenes, some voiceovers and boxes of text....... Missions get repetitive and boring very early in the game. Also, no co-op... even though the Xbox One version has it.

This is your typical top down shooter/more of an arcade campaign style game.  For 5 bucks you can't really complain with what you get.  Growing up with arcades around this actually brings up that nostalgic feeling of being there.  Basically you fight off hordes of covs with elements of tower defense.  The more enemies you off, the more you defend, the more you keep things alive, and so on the more xp you get. You save up xp to use weapons, armor abilities, and so on for different missions.  It isn't really needed all the time to save up for the sniper rifle or the rocket launcher as the base weapons get the job done.  I would suggest this being a game you play day after day, but more as a time killer or a party game per say.  If you're looking for Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3-ODST, Reach, and 4...this isn't that kinda game letalone an FPS at all, so you will be dissapointed if you come in looking for that.","April 6, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of FPS, it's now an isometric "twin-stick" shooter. You are now playing various spartans as sort of a historical simulation / entertainment where you fight the Convenant forces on various battlefields. There's shoot, grenade, melee, shield, and the standard two weapon limit just like Halo itself. Missions aren't that different: clear the area of Convenant invaders, get through the gauntlet of Convenant defenders, escort friendlies through hostile territory, and more. There are vehicles too.\n\nThe fun of the game is to 1) score well and get gold medal performance, and 2) add difficulty modifiers to increase your score even more. Missions are relatively short and there's really only one way through, and they are not too terribly hard in the easiest difficulty level. The full complement of Halo weapons are here, from the magnum and needler to spartan laser and energy sword. As are the weapon crates and reload closets, turrets, and more.\n\nFor people who still remember the "Crusader" series, this may be about as close as you come to it. It's a fun little game.","May 29, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've decided that you just dont like top-down arcade shooters where you play for highscore, you aren't going to like it (becuase you're a bad person). Just be sure to use keyboard and mouse and throw your controller away.\n\nFirst of all, forget what happened in the Halo Xbox games. The theme of this game is that you are in a virtual combat simulator reliving historic battles that Spartans have fought and won. This has nothing to do with Master Chief.\nIt's a Halo game and it is beautiful. All of the models' animations are fluid and the AI is tight. The big kicker is that it is a top-down shooter, which I think is refreshing and is a great start for the first Halo game on steam. While people think of a FPS when they think Halo, this game is a lot more arcade where you play for points as you go along with the objective. The classic killing sprees are here and you can drive Wraiths and tanks. I was impressed when the Wraith wasn't it's is own enemy and an Elite jumped out when it got low on health, which allowed me to hit him in  the back and getting an Assassin reward and then jumping into the Wraith and running over some Grunts.\n\nThere is a lot of fun to be had here and is a great time-waster. It has been a long time since I have played a game where getting a highscore feels good and means something. After a mission you will get XP which you spend on better weapons like a Rocket Launcher or the classic badass Spartan Laser. Get a good score, buy a better weapon, get an even better score on the next mission. While that could seem cheap, it is a lot of fun. Of course score increases with a killing spree and killing bigger targets.\n\nAre you going to have tons of hours in this game? No. Will you have fun in the time that you do play? I dont see why not.\n","December 26, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So when I saw this I just had to get it because it looked like a lot of fun and is worth $5. The only things I am not pleased with is the no Multiplayer feature and the campaign seems pretty short. i blazed through the first 3 levels in 15 minutes. It really needs a 4 player co-op feature though and they need to make the campaign a little longer and more challenging. other than that it's a pretty good game. Try it out!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suprememessage/recommended/277430/","Suprememessage","Harmonic Revelations","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suprememessage/","271 products in account","As a long-time fan of the Halo series (I bought Halo: Combat Evolved when it came out, and have bought every Halo upon release since then, excluding this one, as I thought a mobile game wouldn't be anywhere near good for the series), this game was actually quite enjoyable. The music felt nice and didn't bore me, which lives up to my expectations since Halo has always had a kick-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• soundtrack since forever, basically.\n\nPicked this one up on sale for 2 dollars, and honestly it was worth it. I wouldn't be as likely to have bought this particular game but I did and don't regret it.\n\nOne thing I particularly like about this is that by expanding the platforms upon which Halo is available it opens it up to a wider audience. I do however have the desire to see The Master Chief Collection on Steam, as while this game does the series justice in the sense it lived up to what it promised, it doesn't do the series justice in the sense of bringing the feel of the rest of the games to PC. Yes, I know Halo CE and Halo 2 had PC ports (I own both), but it would be nice to see Microsoft pay attention to their fanbase in modern time as well. I'd gladly dish out money to play any Halo game on PC.\n\n\nI'm a huge fan of Halo's lore, so it's a nice touch to see what went down between Halo 3 and 4. The story wasn't as overly convuluted as say, Halo 4's. In addition, it was nice to see things featured in Halo Wars pop-up again (Another game I feel is underrated among the fanbase as a whole).\n\nOver all I'd rate this an 8/10, but if you're looking for the classic Halo experience, make sure Microsoft knows you want The Master Chief Collection on PC.\n\n","December 20, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am going to write this review using only facts and at the very end I will give a quick 'my opinion' portion.\n\nSo here they are, a buncha random facts about the game.\n\nGame - Halo: Spartan Assault\nReview Date - 09/01/14\nPlatform - PC/Steam\n\n\nFeatures:-The game was developed by 343 Industries and Vanguard Entertainment\n-As of 09/01/14 the pc version of this game does not have co op and there are 6 operations with 5 missions each.\n-You can rebind most of the keys. You cannot rebind the functions Pause (escape) fire (left click) throw grenade (right click) when using keyboard and mouse.\n-There are drivable vehicles and manable turrets.\n-There are leaderboards for who has scored the highest on specific missions.\n-There are cutscenes in the game.\n-There are achievements in the game (25 at the time of writing).\n-There is a tutorial.\n-Each level has a bronze, silver and gold level of performance (based on your performance).\n-You may adjust the volume of SFX and music in the options, but you cannot do so during a mission.\n-You may disable subtitles in the options.\n-You can adjust resolution, AA and refresh rate in the options. (There does not appear to be a windowed fullscreen or windowed option but when I alt + tabbed the game became windowed.)\n\n\nStory:-The plot of the game takes place between Halo 3 and 4.\n-You play as both spartans Sarah Palmer and Davis.\n-Although the battle rifle(or some variation of it) appears in spartan Davis' hands during the cutscene for operation E, no such weapon is available for use in the actual game.\n-There are no 'halos'(ringworlds) in Halo: Spartan Assault.\n\n\nMechanics:-You never reload in this game. All weapons fire until you are completely out of ammo.\n-Running over a weapon you are holding will automatically pick up the ammo in the gun on the ground (this includes plasma weapons).\n-When you throw a grenade it will travel towards your cursor location.\n-Firing slows your movement down.\n-While inside of a vehicle or turret it will take damage and you will not. If you are in one of them when it is destroyed you die.\n-Grenades can hit obstacles on their way to target and get stuck.\n-The plasma pistol can be charged to deal chunk damage to vehicles and disable them.\n-While banshee's do fly overhead, you never actually fight or drive one.\n-You can hold up to 5 plasma grenades and frag or incendiary at a time.\n-You hold up to two weapons at a time and can swap between them.\n-You can melee using the melee key (default space bar).\n-There is a border at the edge of each mission to which you can not go past(a visible barrier). Enemies will sometimes phase into the playable area from outside this region and will be invincible until they fully phase in.\n-You have a Radar that shows enemies as red dots.\n-There are explosive barrels and objects that can hurt you and enemies.\n-You can drive over enemies which will kill them instantly.\n-You will be killed instantly if a vehicle (including your own) drives over you.\n-If you use the 'hollow' and 'pacifist' skull you can kill yourself by shooting until all of your shield is gone.\n\n\nGeneral:-You can only increase the difficulty with skulls.\n-There are 6 skulls total.\n-You may only apply 2 skulls max.\n-Applying skulls increases experience point gain.\n-You can performs certain tasks to gain lump sums of experience points by filling objectives known as Assault OPS .\n-There are weekly objectives and mission specific ones.\n-Experience points can be spent to swap out your primary, alternate weapon or your armor ability. They can also be used to apply a buff such as increased score.\n-It is possible to get all 25 achievements in under 25 hours.\n-There are no flood in this game on the pc version at the time of this review .\n\n\nPersonal:\n-I purchased the game for 1.69$\n-I 100%ed the game after around 25 hours of play.\n\n\n\nQuick opinion:\nYou can ignore this section unless you're still on the fence about the game and want my opinion.\n\nI'm not too sure how to feel about this game and whether or not to recommend it. I would definitely say I got my money's worth at 1.69$, but I'm left with an oddly sour taste in my mouth knowing that I probably will be unable to enjoy any future halo games. This game contains so many inconsistencies from the normal halo that it's hard to enjoy personally and the lack of Co op really hurts the game. I do not know the details of why and whether or not it was an attempt at further cash in on the popularity of the series or not, but what I do feel is that the oppurtunity for a juicy and in depth top down Halo has been passed.\n\nAs a stand alone game it really just was not that bad. I guess if you've got a spare 5 bucks it should provide a few hours of entertainment for ya and honestly if it had Co op this game would be worth 10 bucks IMO especially if they added more than the 5 available on xbox.","September 1, 2014","true","26.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even as an exclusive PC gamer, I still enjoyed the ports of Halo 2&1, riddled as they were with problems, I worked my way through them because there were qualities I found very pleasing about the games.\n\nI'm happy to say that many of those qualities are present in Halo: Spartan Assault as well.\nI'm talking about the general aesthetics, the art and feel of the universe you are playing in, the designers not fearing to use more vibrant and exotic colours, but combining them to truly give an alien feel to many sceneries. The maps and environments in this game have captured one of these key features of Halo, and I found myself really liking just walking around looking at the worlds you are situated in.\nEven as a top-down shooter, you get the feel that the Covenant forces still are the same old Covenants you ran into back in the first Halo, despite them being smaller figures now seen from a distance, they are crafted to evoke just the essence of our staple alien friends.\nThe AI too has been made to match much of the similar elements you saw the NPCs doing back in Halo 1. With Elites running, strafing, chasing, lobbing grenades, taking cover, dodging and being more versatile than the grunts or jackals, both of whom can run away from you in fear, the jackals if you have brought down their shields and the grunts when friends of theirs have died for instance.\nThe weapons are a good mix and actually I found almost all of them useful, which was shocking, even the dual SMGs felt useful as a spray and pray -type of weapon to deal with swarms of low to medium threat enemies coming at you. I think all are the original ones we have seen in the games, and their feel remains the same, though scaled down of course.\nI was surprised at how pleasant the effects and graphics were, this can look beautiful and impressive at many times, and seeing explosions and debris flying around too evoke me to like this as an equal to the gameplay of Halo 1 (though not perhaps Halo 2, which I found even more enjoyable, yes, I am horrible for liking Halo 2 more). The lighting and particles too, even though minimalistic because this is a minimalistic game, have been made very well and fitting to the atmosphere of our Halo universe.\nThe maps are short, but sweet and show a dedication to detail, the campaign is short too, but fun to replay, and the medals, assault ops and acheivements add the replayability.\n\nWhen I bought this game I was nervous about how well it would play, the system requirements listed are rather high, my mediocre laptop only meets the minimum requirements (2 core 2ghz cpu, 4gig ram with shared memory intel hd graphics win 7), but I get consistently high frame rates in this game, and you can't set many settings down, only resolution, anti-aliasing, and the frame rate. So actually I could play decently this game. And rather bug free I might add.\n\nControls feel like the biggest disappointment - I can live with not being able to modify many settings in this game, but the way the mouse, character and camera moves are not intuitive, and you can make a top-down shooter with great controls, just look at Shadowgrounds. Well, there is still time for a patch to make this a thing of the past.\n\nLast sorrow was that this game lacks the same epic/movie-style storytelling of Halo 1/2, it has some beautiful prerendered short cinematics between some operations, but not the same kind of adventure style, of showing our progression. Perhaps that was because this was again mainly designed for mobiles in mind, and they feared adding too intense cutscenes or longer ones (perhaps even some memory limitations or other?). Also, I am sympathetic to the makers wanting to shift the focus and show the universe from a different perspective, I just hoped that in doing so, we players could have enjoyed the depth of the story more.\n\nBut on the whole, I've enjoyed this a lot. Fun gameplay, making simple seem respectable in many ways, lovingly made graphics and visuals that border on the artistic. Here's hoping that We will get the chance to see the rest of the Halo games being brought to Steam!

I am going to write this review using only facts and at the very end I will give a quick 'my opinion' portion.\n\nSo here they are, a buncha random facts about the game.\n\nGame - Halo: Spartan Assault\nReview Date - 09/01/14\nPlatform - PC/Steam\n\n\nFeatures:-The game was developed by 343 Industries and Vanguard Entertainment\n-As of 09/01/14 the pc version of this game does not have co op and there are 6 operations with 5 missions each.\n-You can rebind most of the keys. You cannot rebind the functions Pause (escape) fire (left click) throw grenade (right click) when using keyboard and mouse.\n-There are drivable vehicles and manable turrets.\n-There are leaderboards for who has scored the highest on specific missions.\n-There are cutscenes in the game.\n-There are achievements in the game (25 at the time of writing).\n-There is a tutorial.\n-Each level has a bronze, silver and gold level of performance (based on your performance).\n-You may adjust the volume of SFX and music in the options, but you cannot do so during a mission.\n-You may disable subtitles in the options.\n-You can adjust resolution, AA and refresh rate in the options. (There does not appear to be a windowed fullscreen or windowed option but when I alt + tabbed the game became windowed.)\n\n\nStory:-The plot of the game takes place between Halo 3 and 4.\n-You play as both spartans Sarah Palmer and Davis.\n-Although the battle rifle(or some variation of it) appears in spartan Davis' hands during the cutscene for operation E, no such weapon is available for use in the actual game.\n-There are no 'halos'(ringworlds) in Halo: Spartan Assault.\n\n\nMechanics:-You never reload in this game. All weapons fire until you are completely out of ammo.\n-Running over a weapon you are holding will automatically pick up the ammo in the gun on the ground (this includes plasma weapons).\n-When you throw a grenade it will travel towards your cursor location.\n-Firing slows your movement down.\n-While inside of a vehicle or turret it will take damage and you will not. If you are in one of them when it is destroyed you die.\n-Grenades can hit obstacles on their way to target and get stuck.\n-The plasma pistol can be charged to deal chunk damage to vehicles and disable them.\n-While banshee's do fly overhead, you never actually fight or drive one.\n-You can hold up to 5 plasma grenades and frag or incendiary at a time.\n-You hold up to two weapons at a time and can swap between them.\n-You can melee using the melee key (default space bar).\n-There is a border at the edge of each mission to which you can not go past(a visible barrier). Enemies will sometimes phase into the playable area from outside this region and will be invincible until they fully phase in.\n-You have a Radar that shows enemies as red dots.\n-There are explosive barrels and objects that can hurt you and enemies.\n-You can drive over enemies which will kill them instantly.\n-You will be killed instantly if a vehicle (including your own) drives over you.\n-If you use the 'hollow' and 'pacifist' skull you can kill yourself by shooting until all of your shield is gone.\n\n\nGeneral:-You can only increase the difficulty with skulls.\n-There are 6 skulls total.\n-You may only apply 2 skulls max.\n-Applying skulls increases experience point gain.\n-You can performs certain tasks to gain lump sums of experience points by filling objectives known as Assault OPS .\n-There are weekly objectives and mission specific ones.\n-Experience points can be spent to swap out your primary, alternate weapon or your armor ability. They can also be used to apply a buff such as increased score.\n-It is possible to get all 25 achievements in under 25 hours.\n-There are no flood in this game on the pc version at the time of this review .\n\n\nPersonal:\n-I purchased the game for 1.69$\n-I 100%ed the game after around 25 hours of play.\n\n\n\nQuick opinion:\nYou can ignore this section unless you're still on the fence about the game and want my opinion.\n\nI'm not too sure how to feel about this game and whether or not to recommend it. I would definitely say I got my money's worth at 1.69$, but I'm left with an oddly sour taste in my mouth knowing that I probably will be unable to enjoy any future halo games. This game contains so many inconsistencies from the normal halo that it's hard to enjoy personally and the lack of Co op really hurts the game. I do not know the details of why and whether or not it was an attempt at further cash in on the popularity of the series or not, but what I do feel is that the oppurtunity for a juicy and in depth top down Halo has been passed.\n\nAs a stand alone game it really just was not that bad.

Not a bad arcade style Halo spin-off, not really as exciting as other Halo games, this twin stick shooter starring Halo characters is just an appetizer for a full course meal that may never be released to PC.  On its own merits, this is a decent casual game for people who want small doses of the Halo experience and for people who simply want something challenging in the twin stick shooter category.

You can board enemy vehicles, you have only 2 weapons at a time, and can switch them to other weapons you find in the battlefield.\n\nEnemies behave just like in the FPS games: Kill an elite and the grunts that were following him will flee sometimes. Or if you stuck the elite with a plasma grenade, he will charge at you to try to take you with him.\n\nAlso, most of the weapons, vehicles and enemies sound like you'd expect them to. Except for the drones; for some reason, they sound like the engineers from ODST and Reach. And the soundtrack does have the Halo feel (and some great tracks!)\n\nGameplay-wise, it does represent a challenge but nothing overwhelming. Only by activating skulls you will get that challenge that the vanilla gameplay does not bring.\n\nAnother important aspect worth mentioning is that the missions are too short. You will spend at most 5 minutes on a mission. But at least they are varied so you don't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nConclusion: The game is enterteaing. Lining up your shots and saving ammo is still a thing. And if you're a Halo fan, you'll apreciate the care the developers put into making it feel like Halo.","December 8, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/automatonimation/recommended/277430/","automatonimation","robot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/automatonimation/","31 products in account","I have no problem admitting that I am a Halo "fanboy". I played Halo when it was first released, and every subsequent Halo ever produced. With that being said, I'm no slouch and I won't sugar coat this games' flaws just because I love the franchise. Read on for a legitimate review from a player who was there from the very beginning.\n\n\nThis game is short; incredibly short in fact. It was designed around mobile devices that utilize the mobile version of the Windows 8 operating system, specifically tablets. People are going to tell you, "Incorrect, it was developed to serve as an interim game during the time between Halo 4's release, and Halo 5's release on the Xbox One". The sad fact is that this statement is just flat out untrue. This game was designed for the sole purpose of Microsoft attempting to secure their portion of the mobile app/game marketplace. They figured that if they released a "Halo" game for the mobile device world, the name alone would convert a giant percentage of gamers who would be new to Microsoft products, while at the same time getting existing Microsoft/Halo consumers to purchase and subsequently convert to the Windows 8 operating system. This is evident of the fact that Halo: Spartan Assault was initially released EXCLUSIVELY for Windows 8 and its mobile device distribution.\n\nA few months later, once Microsoft realized their fiscal mistake in limiting the game only to Windows 8/Mobile users, they released the game for Xbox One and then the Xbox 360. Notice anything coincidental in the timeline of those releases?\n\n\n\nAnd so all this background information converges nicely into the rest of my review:\n\n\nFeel and Control:\n\nCons:\n- The aim controls for a mouse and keyboard are weird at best. The crosshair feels like it's on this fixed dimensional grid and you can see that when you try to aim at enemies, it just snaps into the general vicinity of where you want to actually aim, and not directly on what you're aiming at. At least not without a couple attempts. If anyone reading this review is familiar with the aiming system in Alien Swarm, I'm certain you will agree that Halo's aim system falls incredibly short in comparison. Halos aim system transitioning feels incredibly forced when using a mouse and keyboard, and although it's not the absolute worst I've had to deal with, it just doesn't feel right.\n\n- The crosshair and aiming should have been tied directly in to player movement instead of being what is essentially "free". You can have the Spartan looking in one direction and have the crosshair all the way in the opposite direction direction, while being unable to shoot at the target until you move the Spartan with WASD. This system destroys the flow of the game.\n\nPros:\n- The gameplay in terms of graphical smoothness is perfectly fine. Because of its top down nature, there isn't much strain on the processor or graphics card, and so aside from the aiming system, the gameplay is smooth.\n\n- There are only eight or nine(I forget how many exactly) keybinds, three of which can not be modified, which in turn means that the controls are simple and easy to get used to.\n\n- The game offers both controller and mouse/keyboard support. Mouse/keyboard feels forced, but the fact that it supports these two input devices and not controllers exclusively, trumps any flaws that the aim system may have... in my opinion anyways.\n\n- The loadout system definitely offers some variability and is sure to give you some new ways to complete the missions, subsequently raising the level of the games replayability. Not by enough though.\n\n\nMaps/Graphics/Environments/Storyline:\n\nCons:\n- One thing I noticed that really confused me was that the maps had elevated surfaces in certain spots. This game in particular lacks in the ability to portray depth of any kind, and because of the fact that the gameplay is TOP-DOWN, I can't for the life of me understand why the developers would create maps with any variation in elevation. In a top down video game, the maps should be completely flat otherwise the inevitable happens; because the game can't portray depth well, you find yourself in a situation where it appears as though you're shooting at an enemy but for whatever reason your bullets just stop short. In reality, because the map in that particular area is not flat like it should be, you're positioned at the bottom of the elevation and the target is positioned at the top. You unwittingly shoot at the floor while the bot shoots you dead. -- This situation in particular has happened to me quite often, and occured mostly in the first two missions.\n\n- The game is painfully short, and apparently most of the other reviewers seem to either be in denial, or just hardcore, blind-faith, "drink the coolaide" type fanboys. There is virtually no replayability in this game unless you strive to waste a large portion of your life maintaining a spot on the global leaderboards. THERE IS NO CO-OP ON THIS VERSION. Co-op is offered exclusively for the Microsoft gaming consoles, which means you can't even play it with your friends. Thumbs down.\n\n- The story isn't anything special.\n\n- The game has some issues with multiple monitors. If you have multiple monitors you will see that other than the monitor you're playing the game on, the rest will be blacked out. And it's inconsistent as well; sometimes it does this, and other times the game won't black out your other monitors.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics are smooth, and the environments/maps are also done pretty well with only a couple exceptions.\n\n- The cut scenes are awesome, evident of the typical work from the Halo franchise.\n\n\n\n\nSo in the end, is it worth $4.99? Yeah, I would say go for it if you're a Halo fan like I am. One reason I bought it is because it's the only Halo game offered on Steam and I've been waiting for a Halo game to be released on Steam for a long time.\n\nBut here's the main reason I bought it: I'm hoping that if enough people buy the game and show interest in the idea of having Halo games released on and supported by Steam/Valve, then Microsoft will, eventually, go through with the decision to port the older games to the Steam platform.\n\nA bit of a pipe-dream you say? Probably. Especially now that Microsoft has formed their own version of an app-store/gaming platform for PC users. I can hope though... I can hope.","April 6, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a top-down, isometrict point and click shooter. It is not the traditional Halo game. If you are expecting this to give you the same experience as Halo 1, 2, 3, Read, or 4, then you will be dissapointed.\n\nBUT WAIT. KEEP READING:\n\nDon't go into this expecting a full Halo experience. Just buy and play the game, as if you've never heard of the Halo series before.\n\nIt's a fairly decent game for what it does. The levels are fairly straightforward, you follow blips on your radar to mission goals. There are the familiar Halo enemies like the Elites, Grunts, and Jackals. The same Halo weapons are here, except some of the smaller guns like the pistol and plasma pistol are gimped by their slow rate of fire and lack of scope mechanism.\n\nShooting is a little difficult in this game. I found it near impossible to aim with an Xbox controller. It's a lot better with a mouse and keyboard, though still not perfect. And controlling the Scorpion tank is nigh impossible with the mouse AND controller.\n\nOh, yeah. There are vehicles. They work the same way they do in the main games, just from a different perspective.\n\nSome have complained that the missions are boring or repetitive, but I've found them to be pretty fun. The game allows you to set skulls (anyone who has played the Xbox games will know what this is) to increase difficulty and multiply your score.\n\nIt does have the Halo atmosphere, even though it isn't the same as a classic Halo experience.\n\nThe only thing the game lacks is multiplayer. It would be fun to do some of the missions co-op, though, admittedly, the missions are way to short for that. Some classic CTF or deathmatch modes would be a lot of fun, though. Imagine if there was a top-down version of the classic Blood Gulch map? Support this game and maybe it will happen in an update or DLC.\n\nThis brings me to my mine point. If you want to see some real Halo games on Steam, then support this game. This is an excellent opportunity. Rave about this game, for what it does. It's an excellent deal for only six dollars. I'm hoping if this is successful on Steam, we might see Halo Wars or even the Halo 1 remake. Support this game, email Microsoft or 343 Studios.\n\nIf you're a big fan of the Halo universe and backstory (have read the novels, etc) then you will probably enjow this game. If you only like first-person Halo games, then this will disappoint you. Please don't buy the game, then ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because it's not the game you actually wanted.

Buy this game.\nAre you a fan of twin stick shooters? Buy this game on sale.\n\nSpartan Assault is basically a very professional and polished mobile title, the gameplay is fairly standard, and yet manages to reflect it's source material surprisingly well. In this game you feel like a Spartan, you have access to weapons, equipment and vehicles from the Halo world, and there are many moments that make you feel like you're playing a Halo game. You can hijack vehicles, punch tanks, use armor abilities, dual wield SMGs and stick grenades to hapless grunts, there are even skull modifiers that increase your score. The graphics and music are very high quality for such a cheap game too.\nThe game follows the story of two Spartans, Davis, a newcomer, and Sarah "Eggheads" Palmer from 4, as they fight the Covenant on a Forerunner planet. You'll switch between the two to accomplish various missions ranging from defending bases, escorting transports, rescuing stranded marines and all kinds of things, there's a lot of variety.\nThe missions are short, and designed to be played in small bursts, but they're varied enough to keep you interested, although I have to say the story (told through mission descriptions and Terminal-style animation) is poor for a Halo title. The score attack theme and skull modifiers will give you an incentive to replay missions, although there's no horde mode unfortunately.\n\nI have only two complaints, that the local coop present on the Xbox versions was removed in this port, and that you can't select your weapons before a mission. You may use points accrued from missions to buy a different armor ability or a heavy weapon, but you're not given the option to change your basic loadout.\n\nI got this game for $1.99 and I feel it was a very good deal.\n","April 21, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","At first, I thought of reviewing both Spartan Assault and Spartan Strike as one game, then noting their differences. The Twin-Stick shooter gameplay is similar to make you think that SS is the same as SA (which came first).\n\nHowever, after playing all of SA and 80% of SS, there is a subtle difference in how each game plays that may or may not to be to your liking: The mission structure in SA is less "Halo" than SS, which I think is to the game's benefit.\n\nIt Looks Like Halo, It Plays Like Halo, But It Doesn't Feel Like Halo\nThe PC port for Halo: Spartan Assault (and Spartan Strike) is a mobile/tablet port for an isometric twin-stick shooter (made by the same guys who made Gatling Gears, Vanguard Entertainment).\n\nAlmost all buttons can be remapped, save for the fire, the grenade and the pause button. Controller support is optional, and the keyboard and mouse controls are almost all perfect. The only lacking thing for controls are the vehicles. There are also simplistic options, nothing that is going to tax your computer.\n\nImporting the mechanics of the Halo franchise works, to my surprise, quite well for the genre change with some tweaks to how they all work. Along with some alterations to work within the new genre. For example, no reloading for weapons and the alterations to certain guns like the Spartan Laser's sustained fire.\n\nSome carry-overs from the Halo franchise: The two limit arsenal, the armor abilities, the Skull difficulty modifiers, the later addition of loadouts (which uses XP you earn in completing missions to unlock one-time weapon unlocks and other changes for your loadout), and the very limited arsenal and vehicles. (Yes, you can board them.)\n\nYou'll fight only the Covenant in this game (Elites, Grunts, Jackals and Brutes, which I'm confused to why they're here, but I guess I should've paid more attention to the date). Their AI acts exactly like how they would in the Halo games. Elites are more mobile, Grunts go on sucide runs, Brutes charge at you. You get the idea.\n\n(And the human AIs for your teammates are useful for once. Go figure.)\n\nOddly enough, as this game takes place as a pseudo prequel to Halo 4, you don't actually have a ton of diversity for weaponry. Nor all the Halo stable vehicles. There is no Halo 4 weaponry, and not even all the weapons before that game show up (no BR, no light-machine-gun, no energy swords, no carbines, etc.)\n\nAs you would expect from a mobile game, your objective is to complete simple missions and to get the best raiting. In this game's case, beat the 5 to 10 min missions in the quickest time with the most flare. This is through the medal system from the Halo franchise, which fits in to providing an enjoyable experience.\n\nEven to someone like me who hates the three gold star systems of mobile game, I found its implementation respectful to the Halo franchise (similar to the score mode for campaign). You can get plenty of hours trying to perfect your runs, and there are 30 missions--around two and a half to four hours of content--which don't often repeat the same objective next to each other.\n\nI also never felt undermanned nor pressured for using the special weapons you can unlock for a mission--the rocket-launcher, the sniper rifle and the Spartan laser. And even "buying" the temporary loadouts does not guarantee you'll get the best score for this game. (Trust me, I tried to break the game with the awesome rocket-launcher and found myself only getting silvers.)\n\nSpartan Assault's Drawbacks\nIf you want to buy this game for the story, you can pass this series of games right off. SA and SS are only simulations of events that you have no bearing on, and even when the game does get serious you won't care. (Plus, the Spartan IV program is a bunch of whinny wimps.)\n\nIf you do not like the mobile route, then you might not also like the series. Although I do think there is something here if you're a Halo enthusiast who found Halo Wars an interesting attempt of branching out the franchise. It doesn't do anything superb or innovative, but the game is competent and feels mostly balanced.\n\nThe vehicle controls are somewhat stiff in comparison to SS. They move based on your WASD movements, not your actual direction you move--like how Halo does it as well as SS. I never found it bothersome but you may find it more annoying.\n\nSome people complained about the gunplay about some weapons, but I used all the weapons and they felt useful, never a wasted item in this game. I did notice some "weird" unresponsiveness to shooting my guns at times. (There were somtimes a delay on shooting the gun that I never could make sense of. SS had far more instances of this problem than SA.)\n\nInterested? Buy the Bundle\nIf you are interested in these games, I would definitely recommend the bundle whether on a discount or full price. You'll get your money's worth together rather than paying for them individually.\n\nI would definitely say Spartan Assault is the better of the two games because the game plays similar enough to the Halo FPS series while making something new. Spartan Strike suffers from the same problems Halo missions can suffer from; abitrary restraints on the player.\n\nThis problem is fine for a linear FPS with checkpoints, but for a mobile game with short missions, you'll find the abitrary mission objective changes the bane of your time. Not the brevity of the missions nor the simplicity of the genre.","November 29, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's your top down twin-stick shooter game with nice responsive controls whither you play on Keyboard and Mouse or your 360 Wired Controller.\nIt also has options for touch screen for those with the capabilities but I'll leave that out of the review since I don't have one.\n\nGraphics- not much. It was made for mobile phones so don't expect to be blown away from them- but with capabilites of 720P and higher resolution with up to 8xAA it won't look that bad.\nYou can cap your FPS at your full refresh rate or half of it if you want (standard 60Hz, 30Hz) or none at all. It was kind of funny to see 500FPS average with my GTX760. My card actually downclocked itself since it was pretty much running idle. The cutscenes are beautifully animated and well drawn while being short.\n\nGameplay- Fast pace with a strange Halo echo to it despite being a major departure of the standard FPS shooter. You aim with either your mouse or right thumbstick (aim assist on the controller is prevelent) move with the left stick or ASDW keys and fire with the mouse or trigger buttons. The basic premises of the story is that you are re-enacting events in the past via simulations where you play as various Spartans in the sudden new Covenant War. Animations and sound feel and look like Halo, watching Grunts cower in fear like previous games is just as satisfying as it was back in Combat Evolve. The game is divided into Operations A-F and then x-5 with 30 playable missions in all- however, missions are brief and last no longer than 3-5 minutes.\n\nOne problem I've seen is that the 'upgrades' (overshield, sentery turret, and seeker drone) and 'weapons' (the spartan laser, sniper rifle, and rocket launcher) are single use and would have to be bought again with EXP you earn in the game. Haven't never played the mobile or arcade version of the game, this kind of screams micro transaction left over which may seem kind of lazy.\n\nThe Iconic Skulls make a return to the game to increase your game score multiplyer, such as Hollow where the Spartan has no health and only shields, or the classic Famine where ammo drops are less than usual. However, the famous IWHBD Skull is absent from the game as enemies make no understandable noises other than screeches and bellows.\n\nGames are replayable, where you can compete in online leaderboards for the highest score. Medals also make a return where kill streaks and sprees can earn you medals- these sprees will end if you take damage. They have a nice variety of 32 possible medals to earn, though not all of them you can earn in a single level.\n\nAssault Ops are the are challenges players can choose to pursue. There are weekly and mission specific missions you can undertake- such as Kill 250 Covies in Operation C for Weekly and Kill 50 Grunts in A-1. Completing these earn you EXP that you can buy said weapons and upgrades.\n\nAll in all, the game is a nice time passer for only 5 bucks with enough replayability to warrent multiple playthroughs. While not deep gameplay wise it's still a pleasent experinece for those itching for more Halo action.\nGuardian Verdict: 65/100 - Plausable Purchase.","April 5, 2014","true","1.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unlike the other Halo games, Spartan Assault is a top-down shooter rather than first-person, which may turn off some people from the game. While it may not be the best of the Halos, it still has good things about it. The game has a pretty good story, and also brings alot of vehicles and weapons, such as the Grizzly, Hawk, Focus Rifle and dual SMGS, from previous Halos, rather than only having things from Halo 4, which I like. The gameplay is good for what it is. As for the graphics, the game, being developed mainly for phones then ported to PC and Xbox, doesn't have the best graphics, but that doesn't bother me. One thing I like is that they removed the microtransactions which were present on the phone version for the Steam release. Overall, Halo Spartan Assault is really nice and it being 4.99, it's really worth the price. I hope to see more Halo games, like Halo 2 or 3 coming to Steam soon.\n\n8/10.","April 5, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I had a look in the windows store and the reviews seemed mixed, most people complaining about microtransactions and such.\nHowever i thought i would give it a try nonetheless, and to my surprise it is actually quite nice... No, it isn't your typical first person, shoot everything type of Halo, or even a top down RTS like Halo Wars, but what we do have, is a nice little top down, arcade style shooter in which you play through a series of missions, set in a simulation taking place before the events of Halo 4.\nI have played about 5 hours so far, and it has been fun, there are no microtransactions that i can see, however when you begin a mission, you choose your loadout, you can either use the default one, or a custom one which you use xp to choose, so i can see how they might implement it if they wish.\nThere are special missions, just like in other halo games, that you get xp for completing, and weekly challenges.\nOne thing i wouldlike to see in the future is the addition of coop, if the phone version can have it then i am sure this can too, and it would make it alot more fun. There is alot of negativity about this game, people saying it's a waste of time, and just Microsoft trying to make money. But who cares if it is? it's cheap, it's Halo, and it's on Steam.

Halo: Spartan Assault is very generic shoot-them-up which puts player to the boots of spartans - an elite soldiers with energy shield. The game has 30 missions total and most of them are about defending some position or rushing through the map killing all the enemies which stand on your way. However there is also some cool vechile driving missions where player supremely crushes enemies with terran- or covenant tank with all familiar weapons included!\nI don't know what Halo -enthusiasts think, but I found the story nothing signigicant - terrains and covenant compete ground control and hunt some powerful relic laying somewhere.\nAll in all Halo: Spartan Assault is good fun in small steps and that's also primary reason I wonder why there isn't any co-op availabilities which would have done Spartan Assault nice party game - well maybe in the sequel if it should have one.","December 16, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's a fun little game, turning Halo into a top-down twinstick shooter. Considering the price tag, the presentation is excellent, it looks and sounds like I remember Halo; bright colorful graphics with some cool designs mixed with an epic soundtrack and memorable soundeffects like your shield recharging.\n\nGameplay-wise it manages to feel a lot like Halo but also streamlines everything to be more arcade-ish. The whole dynamic of attacking and retreating to get your shield back up, as well as the constant switching of weapons and using the equipment of beaten foes is present albeit in a more simplistic manner than in the main games of the series. Even the driving-sequences feel suitably Halo-ish. With 30 missions and about 3-4 hours to unlock them all it's actually quite a big/long game considering what it is, luckily the missions themselves are on the short side and can be completed in a couple minutes each (which I did like, a lot). Using Skulls to alter the difficulty of each mission adds further challenges and longevity, and if you aren't tiring of the game you can always go for earning a gold ranking on every mission as well as doing weekly "quests" and mission-specific bonus objectives - for 5 bucks there is a lot of stuff in here that can/will keep you occupied.\n\nMy biggest issues with the game right now is the lack of cooptional action with friends, going for that gold-ranking or the high score with a fellow spartan from my neighborhood would have been the best. As it is, it's a well executed time waster in the Halo universe, good for a playthrough or two but nothing you absolutely HAVE to own or must play.","April 13, 2014","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/backlogger/recommended/277430/","backlogger","Backlogger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/backlogger/","1533 products in account","So far the best part about the game is that its Halo. If it wasn't Halo, this type of game probably wouldn't draw as much interest from me to be honest. Its pretty basic. It looks like there are 4-5 operations with 5 or so levels each. Each level so far has been pretty short, it maybe only takes 5 minutes to complete. Similar to mobile games, each level has a possible 3 stars (bronze, silver and gold) based on how many points you earn during the level. At the start of a level you are able to select a load out of two weapons and some type of armor upgrade. The default load out is "free" and to change the default load out you must spend XP gained during previous levels. You can also select from 6 handicaps (up to 2) that will multiply your XP gained during that level. It looks like in order to get a gold star at the end of the level you probably need to use a handicap. Examples are: one handicap makes your armor deplete as you are firing a weapon, another gives weapons you pick up less default ammo. You get points or XP from killing enemies and from kill bonuses like double and triple kills, etc.\n\nIts what you would expect from a Halo game in terms of the types of aliens you are fighting and the weapons that are available. Like other Halo games you usually run out of ammo from your default load out and have to pick up enemy weapons along the way. You also get grenades, which are fun, and some levels have cannons that you can get inside and blow up aliens.\n\nEach level has some type of objective you have to complete, like destroying 3 objects or escorting vehicles.\n\nThe game has steam cloud support, achievements and cards, which make it very Steam friendly. Even if you don't like the game you can get cards to sell or a badge to craft or if you are lucky a booster pack. The game also has full controller support, which I haven't tried yet. I wish the game had some type of local/online co-op.\n\nThe game is fun, but not mind blowing. Definitely a casual unless you go for 3 stars on every level, but even then so far the levels have all been so short its probably not a huge pain to grind out the 3 stars. All in all I am glad I bought it, but unless you are a Halo fanatic there probably isn't a huge rush to go out and buy it. Its currently on sale on the Windows 8 Storefront and xBox Live store, so I would expect this to be on sale at some point.","April 4, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

I really did. But deep down, the game has a major flaw that ruins it.\n\nIt's Halo. I've played Halo Wars, I know that Halo DOESN'T need to be an FPS, but yet IT WORKED WELL THERE, WHAT HAPPEND HERE!?\n\nIn an hour, I got bored sick of the game. And the funny thing is, even while playing with Skulls, I beated two of the five stories on the game (I also bought the sequel, which I won't even touch). In an hour. So that's like, two hours and a half of game.\n\nThe game also has a few other problems beside that, though those are really small details:\n\n-No reloading. This makes some weapons stupidly broken. Why getting the Assaunt Rifle when I can just go Full SMG? There's plenty of ammo in some maps anyway. And in others you can just drop the weapon and pick another.\n\n-Stages are way too short. Some of them can be beat in some miserable 2-3 minutes, and that's unexcusable when the game has 25 of them.\n\n-The story is... Well, lack-luster. After having gems like Halo 1 and 2 on PC, AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF WAITING, this is what PC gets? A generic story about two generic Spartans who are saving planets you probably don't know because reasons, which noone of that you'll get to care at any moment.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do like Arcade games like these... But this? I don't really think that it's good enough, even for Halo fans (and I'm including myself there: I have played them all so far, and this is worse than ODST and it's lack-luster unfinished story mode on release). Personally, I would buy the sh#t out of Halo 1-2 if they suddenly appear in Steam, but these companies keep ignoring PC because Halo is one of the games that's making the Xbox sell these days (most of their "exclusive games" are getting into PC, and they're making the console redudant as hell).\n\nOh, and I couldn't find any Red vs Blue easter egg. A Halo game without Red vs Blue references (not counting Halo Wars and the original Halo Combat Evolved) is like a Disgaea game without extreme grinding.

I did enjoy my time with it, but I am a Halo fan and love the universe.  I think in the end my issues with the game outweigh the positives.  First off I don't regret my purchase at all.  The 3 hours it took me to beat the campaign were worth the price of entry for me.  I will also be coming back to it and trying to get higher scores on the missions.  First off the game works just fine, I had no issues technically.  I played with my keyboard and mouse for most of the game only pulling out my 360 pad for a couple of missions.  The keyboard and mouse worked great for the most part and allowed me to use grenades and weapons a lot more acurately.  As for the campaign itself, the story didn't impress me at all and I didn't really feel like I learned more about the Halo-verse.  Unless I am missing something there does not seem to be any sort of horde or survival mode and that is sorely missed.  In the end I would recommend this game for Halo fans and Halo fans only unless you pick it up for cheap in a sale.\n\nPros\n+ Mouse and keyboard work fine\n+ Decent twin-stick\n+ Halo universe\n+ $4.99 cheap base price\n+ Replayability from highscores and skulls\n\nCons\n- Tank controls with keyboard and mouse suck, like really REALLY suck.\n- Zoomed in a bit far for a larger screen.\n- Can't bind actions to mouse buttons, + can rebind to keyboard. (also can't rebind fire and grenade)\n- Insta-death situations with bumping into vehicles.\n- Campaign is rather short(~3 hours)\n- Pause button is in the center of the screen at the bottom, easy to accidently click.\n- No horde/survival mode to my knowledge\n- No multiplayer\n\nOverall my issues with it range from minor to infurating, but none of them break the game.  If you are wanting to get a half-decent twin-stick with a Halo theme go ahead and dive in.  If you are looking for a great twin-stick I would recommend looking elsewhere.","April 5, 2014","false","6.1"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","0"

It's actually a decent port (more or less) they still keep some of the obvious touchscreen hud on screen which gets in your way when you try to fire at enemies and end up pausing the game instead (it happens a lot) regardless of the choice you make as your control setup.\n\nThe option settings in this game are sub-par. Very few settings. Resolution anti-aliasing, control scheme and volume.\n\nThe game is split up into 30 missions, most of the missions can be done in a few minutes but there are challenges and weapons/perks to buy and use. There is a ranking system that allows you to get either a bronze, silver or gold star. These don't really do anything unless you are getting achievements. At the end of each stage you'll get a cutscene and these do actually look pretty nice.\n\nIf you go into this not expecting anything you'll probably be positively surprised.\n\nHaving said that, I'm kind of indifferent about the Series as a whole, I played some good and some bad. So if you're a hardcore fan you probably won't like this, also this is a prequel to Halo 4 which is odd considering it's an Xbone exclusive.\n\nThey actually kept most of the SFX from the series as well, keeping it authentic, except for the Banshee which sounds like a F1 car, for some reason. Most of the weapons work the way they do in Halo, however from what I recall from playing Halo and Halo 2 the plasma pistol was more or less the worst gun, in this game it appears to be one of the best, providing you charge it up.\n\nThere's about 11 weapons (from what i can remember) and 4 driveable vehicles. For some reason all of the vehicles are insta-kills‚Ñ¢ even if they come towards you at 1MPH.\n\nThe AI is also pretty bad, for example if you throw a grenade at them, they'll leave the explosive radius only to run back into it. Enemies piloting vehicles won't stop for their own team, so they'll just be flattened instantly. Your teammates don't fair any better, they seem to be stuck to you via an invisible leash, as opposed to splitting up from you and helping when there are multiple objectives. There is also no way to command your teammates to do certain actions, considering the fact that you're considered an elite soldier, nobody seems to care what you think. The AI also enjoys repeating the same 3 lines. Usually 'Good Work, Dawg'\n\nOverall the game is above average and is actually pretty enjoyable (which is a nice change).

It's a simple game too, you are given an objective and you must murder a ton of covenant soldiers as you do said objective. The game has a story, telling between the events of Halo 3 and Halo 4, in which spartan Sarah Palmer and Spartan Davis. The covenant you are fighting are not the separatists from Halo 3, but rather a rogue fleet who ignored the cease-fire. It's a light story but mission and map descriptions offer more in the Halo universe which I always welcome.\n\nThe gameplay like I said is simple, you spend EXP you earn to buy weapons and gear to help you. (May I mention I see a 'Microtransactions' tag for this game, I see NO microtransactions in this game unless you count buying ingame items with currency you earn ingame) Along with gear you can optionally pick two of six skulls to increase the difficulty but in turn earn yourself more ingame currency. After you pick your items you begin the mission in a fast paced, top down run n' gun style of play. You are restricted to 2 weapons but ammo is plentiful and you can pick up enemy weapons on the fly. The first few missions are slow but the game picks up after about 3 missions. I enjoy the gameplay and being able to hi-jack vehicles is always fun. I will mention this game lacks co-op, I hope they add some co-op maps in soon.\n\nThe sound is part of where this game shines, as the soundtrack, gunfire, and dialogue from allies and enemies add a nice Halo feel to this game. The gameplay obviously is not like the other Halo games other than the weapon and Health mechanics but the sounds are top notch. The soundtrack is also nice as it has the classic Halo feel to it while sounding completely new.\n\nI also would like to mention the presence of Halo Wars units in this game, while I see Halo Wars was not popular, I loved the game and seeing stuff from it is a good feeling. From what I have seen so far there is Grizzlies, Wolverines, and some Covenant turrets returning from Halo Wars. This is a small detail but I always thought that Halo Wars was overlooked because it was not like the other Halo games, and didn't get the attention it deserved. I feel this game shares the same fate, like I said it is by no means a bad Halo game, plus it is cheap. Other than the lack of co-op and some issues I have with the gameplay, I enjoy this game. I don't regret buying it and I'm glad there is no microtransactions like what plagued this game on other systems.

Its a great game.\n\nIf you have never played a Halo game before then I would recomeend you go play them...1-3 is all you really need to play to understand why they are so good. Now for all of us who have played all/most Halo games then you will notice this isnt a normal Halo game. This is a top down shooter. Now most people dont buy it because of that, because its diffrent, but this game is great! It has the same soundtrack, enemies, vehicles, etc. It is a short game, but thats all it needs to be as it is telling a smaller story. maybe 4 hours of gameplay. thats not including achivements, getting gold on all levels, etc.\n\nIt does have a con or two. The biggest being that for (what seems to be) whatever reason the game crashes randomly. Not sure why, just certain levels if you die, the game crashes. The other con is that their is no multiplayer, no Co-op, no Versus, nothing. Just a highscores board.\n\nMy rating, 8/10. The multiplayer was a big bummer, crashes are easily fixed with a reboot of the game.\n\nAlso, why isnt Halo 1-3 on Steam yet?

It was playable for a bit, but updating my video drivers rendered it unplayable. I decided to skip the Xbox version and purchase this version on Steam (glorious is pc gaming, glorious is our master race). It's a good game for $5. Decent story, Decent visuals. Simple, yet fun, gameplay. The soundtrack is fantastic!!! It is different, but keeps that Halo feel (it reminds me of the Halo Wars soundtrack). Overall, it's a good game.\n\nPart of the reason why I purchased it was to also show my support of Halo on Steam in general. Hopefully, other Halo titles can see Steam support and maybe get ports of Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, and Halo: Reach.

Some might criticize the game for being a port of a game based around micro-transactions, and that can be felt verily in the load-out screen to some degree, I personally find these qualities contribute an almost arcadey feel to the game. Yes, you can go through the story like is intended, but it feels just as rewarding to go through the missions you've previously completed. Given that most missions were designed to be the short sort of thing you could play while waiting for an appointment or in commercial breaks while watching television, it doesn't feel like a complete loss if you die.\n\nI experienced the game with the wired gamepad I kept when I outgrew my 360, and aside from the top-down perspective, the controls are feel very close to how I remember the other games, from Combat Evolved through Reach. While there is a very light degree of auto-aim to account for the inaccuracy of thumbsticks, it does not feel as though you don't have to take care when aiming. That being said, you are also allowed the option of keyboard/mouse gameplay. Though I have not tried this option, I imagine the mouse cursor would allow you for more precision aiming.\n\nAudio-wise, I have no opinion one way or the other at this point. The audio isn't bad, but on that same line of reasoning, it does nothing to 'pop out at me' as it were. Given my admiration for the musical scores in the series, this much is a letdown. In the heat of battle, I've heard nothing that's made me stop and say, "This is to Halo: Spartan Assault what the 'Truth and Reconciliation Suite' is to Halo: Combat Evolved."\n\nGiven the presence of the Xbox 360 controller support, it is safe to say that this is most likely based off a similar build to the one from the Windows Marketplace or Xbox Live, so in lacking the co-operative missions present in those versions, it is a bit disappointing. I can only hope that as time goes on, this much can be returned to Spartan Assault, even if it is only something not dissimilar to the Firefight mode many of us are so familiar with.\n\nWhether you're a fan of the series and hope that the sales encourage more Steam ports of Halo classics, or you're simply looking for a game that you can play for a few minutes at a time, I can't say you'll go wrong investing in this game.","April 11, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The cutscenes are well done. And the controls are good for this type of game .The sound design is very good, much of them are taken from the console games with high quality. It is sort of repetitive, more if you count the duration of each mission, about 3-6 min. It has 3 to 4 hours so it is not too long but is has some replay value. But if you don't like getting high scores you will play once and thats all. The graphics are very good.\n\nFor a fan of Halo that never had the money for an XBOX 360 and never continued the saga since Halo 2 , Its a Blessing of God. Halo: Spartan Assault is a 5/10.

It is not, however, a good Halo game. Halo is an epic FPS with wonderful multiplayer, co-op campaign, and more. Spartan Assault is a simple top-down shooter. I have not yet finished the game, but I've completed the first Operation and then some (sets of five missions are grouped as Operations, A-F). The storyline isn't fantastic, but it's not bad. Visually and audio-ally, the game is pleasant to look at and hear, especially considering its humble origins as a mobile game. There is not a tremendous variety in missions (you can only do so much in a top-down shooter), but they have their differences. This game is the kind of game that you will pick up, play for a little while, put it down again, and then come back to it the next day when you have some time that you just want to mess around with. If you don't want a hardcore shooter, but are interested in casually blowing up a few alien jerks in a simple, but fun game, try Halo: Spartan Assault.

You play directly as them firing and throwing grenades at enemies. It sometimes feels recessive because you don't get to admire scenery like in most Halo games. Because you don't get a close up view from Spartan viewpoint you don't get the full effect of the game, it doesn't feel like you're playing, but like you're just ordering around even though you are indeed the one killing most of the enemies. For a Halo game it is less than expected, but the game is good, don't think I mean to say it's bad, I would definitely reccomend getting this if you like Halo and even I may play it again.

From the excellent campaign, the brilliant multiplayer and the revolutionary Forge, the fun never seemed to end. Thousands upon thousands of hours have been lost due to Custom Games alone, a true testament to a fantastic game. Friends would gather for hours on end to discover never-before-seen maps and game types and have an absolute fantastic time while doing so, inspiring some to make their own. Even at the age of 4 years old, Halo 3 still retained a large fan base of hundreds of thousands, something not many video games today can say. Friends and I alike adored the game and worshipped it for its seemingly never-ending fun.\n\nBut now, trouble has disrupted the balance. Thousands of players seek new homes in other video games, they seemingly prefer these new homes as they offer things no other video game does. They seem blind to the fact that Halo 3 is the holy grail of entertainment, and they ignore our pleas. But with your help, 343i, we can restore balance. Most past Halo 3 players reside in the lands of the Personal Computer now and regularly play their video games on Valve Software‚Äôs Steam. Halo 3 can find a new home here, a home with VAC protection, The Workshop and Steam Groups. I am not alone in this plight, for thousands of other Steam users beg of Halo 3 to spread its powerful wings on the Personal Computer. Please, 343i, let these fond memories become present excitements and release Halo 3 on Steam as soon as humanly possible.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMobert Ritchell\n","April 8, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a simple game too, you are given an objective and you must murder a ton of covenant soldiers as you do said objective. The game has a story, telling between the events of Halo 3 and Halo 4, in which spartan Sarah Palmer and Spartan Davis. The covenant you are fighting are not the separatists from Halo 3, but rather a rogue fleet who ignored the cease-fire. It's a light story but mission and map descriptions offer more in the Halo universe which I always welcome.\n\nThe gameplay like I said is simple, you spend EXP you earn to buy weapons and gear to help you. (May I mention I see a 'Microtransactions' tag for this game, I see NO microtransactions in this game unless you count buying ingame items with currency you earn ingame) Along with gear you can optionally pick two of six skulls to increase the difficulty but in turn earn yourself more ingame currency. After you pick your items you begin the mission in a fast paced, top down run n' gun style of play. You are restricted to 2 weapons but ammo is plentiful and you can pick up enemy weapons on the fly. The first few missions are slow but the game picks up after about 3 missions. I enjoy the gameplay and being able to hi-jack vehicles is always fun. I will mention this game lacks co-op, I hope they add some co-op maps in soon.\n\nThe sound is part of where this game shines, as the soundtrack, gunfire, and dialogue from allies and enemies add a nice Halo feel to this game. The gameplay obviously is not like the other Halo games other than the weapon and Health mechanics but the sounds are top notch. The soundtrack is also nice as it has the classic Halo feel to it while sounding completely new.\n\nI also would like to mention the presence of Halo Wars units in this game, while I see Halo Wars was not popular, I loved the game and seeing stuff from it is a good feeling. From what I have seen so far there is Grizzlies, Wolverines, and some Covenant turrets returning from Halo Wars. This is a small detail but I always thought that Halo Wars was overlooked because it was not like the other Halo games, and didn't get the attention it deserved. I feel this game shares the same fate, like I said it is by no means a bad Halo game, plus it is cheap. Other than the lack of co-op and some issues I have with the gameplay, I enjoy this game.

Spartan Laser is very satisfying\nVehicle levels are super-cool\nA nice little touch of Halo returning to the PC Universe!\nInteresting music. Soft and sad, which is strange in an action game, but somewhat captivating\nI liked the cutscenes\nSurprisingly good enemy unit AI\nTONS of levels\nLets not forget the price!\n\nThe Bad Not very deep, terrible writing\nNot very immersive, despite the fun\nSuper-easy, and then super-hard. Difficulty curve is like a rocket ascent.\nDifficulty towards the end ruined the game for me. Instead of being immersed I was thinking "What there's more???"\nEnemy spawning dynamic is frustrating (enemies spawn in certain areas on a timed basis, meaning that in some places you can't ever have your back "covered"\nAiming is imprecise. I've had the mouse reticle directly on top of an enemy, and the bullets fly right past. If the reticle is less about where the bullets hit, and more about a general direction, they should get rid of it\nReticle is also annoying for the alien grenade launcher, which always fires a fixed distance, even if you're aiming for less than that distance\nSome basic enemy types have way too much armor. You blast them for 20 seconds because they're jumping around, wasting time because they're melee units and if they don't attack they're gonna die anyway, but they just dance. Its really annoyingly indecisive. I suspect that the dodge AI assumes they're a gun-weilding unit, because otherwise the dodging makes no sense, and with melee unit armor, it just takes FOREVER and becomes frustrating.\nThe tank controls are AWFUL. Up and down seem to move forward and back, but left and right will rotate until you're left or right, and then become forward and back. Its as-if a gamepad control mechanic was only partially ported.\nMy gamepad didn't work (unrecognized). Wasn't this a console game?\nWHY AREN'T MORE HALO GAMES OUT ON PC? For those of us who are PC gamers, we may have played Halo on PC back in the day, but subsequent Halo games do not appear on Steam or Origin or any of the usual gaming services. So I feel like there's some backstory that I'm missing that would have advanced the story and increased my appreciation for the game narrative. Some monumental events, tech lore, (etc) probably occurring in Halo 2 or Halo 3, is referenced in this game. Maybe it is a mind-blowing twist, but I can't know because as a PC-only gamer, I have no context.  Microsoft makes Windows. Microsoft makes Halo. I understand that they're trying to push XBox sales, but seriously, after 5-6 years, just release the game on PC please.\n\nIn ConclusionIts a fun game, but don't expect too much out of it. Its not terribly immersive, or well-written. The controls are generally good, but fall short in some places that you will notice. At the time that I got it, it was $15 which I think is a fair price, especially if the Halo universe interests you.","March 21, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I feels like a demo to be honest. You can't actually jump and the maps are just so linear and dull you won't notice any difference between them. They could have had huge pitched battles, multiplayer, Co-op. I don't know who the developers were but it is like they got hold of the office swear jar and used it as the budget for this game and made it in their spare time rather than looking at facebook on lazy Fridays.

Halo: Spartan Assault is a top down shooter with a good variety of levels to complete, although the missions are always the same but with different names. And the missions are very short, would take around 5-10min to complete it.\n\nThe combat system is okay, you can switch from your primary to your secondary and also use grenades and your even use your melee weapon. The game also offer a decent amount of customization, before your start your mission you can chose the weapons, the booster, the are some booster to use such as, health, shield, then you have some skulls, this is what makes the game more challenging, you can chose from hide some Hud elements, when a gun drop doesn't have much ammo or make enemies stronger.\n\nThe controllers are fine, i played with keyboard and mouse and i didn't find any difficulty, but i have to say sometimes the mouse laggs a bit but is the only "problem" there.\n\nWell, for 4,99‚Ç¨ is a awesome game a bit repetitive but good, so if you have nothing to play, you like top down shooters i would recommend it.\n\n~ 7/10\n","June 3, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Skip the list for the actual review.\n\n\n\nFor $5, you get a $10 game. How to get max enjoyment out of this game:\n\n1) Like the Halo universe, be somewhat familiar with it\n2) Buy game\n3) Install game\n4) Forget about game\n5) Get bored and peruse through your library, finding this game\n6) Play for ~ an hour\n7) Realize this is a damn fun game for a while\n8) Only play this game when you have nothing else to do, because while it's not some masterpiece like Hotline Miami, it's really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good for its price\n9) Slowly play through the campaign, playing 2-3 missions at a team, taking roughly 20 minutes if you turn on some skulls\n\nGameplay's solid, vehicles can be... interesting, but I feel you SHOULDN'T be able to flawlessly move a tank through a cluttered battlefield without some difficulty. Putting on thunderstorm makes it very challenging, as the AI is intelligent. No reloading, which is nice for this style of game. You just have a *very* extended clip. Melee range is longer than you think it is, and Elites are actually real damn scary sometimes. You have to play intelligently, which isn't really necessary on Halo until you get to Heroic difficulty. The AI Marines are actually fairly useful as well, and the missions (so far) have been intelligent, plausible, and varied.\n\nVerdict: 8/10\n\nHalo: Spartan Assault isn't a AAA title, but it is incredibly good for its price. If you like the Halo franchise, and like games of this style, Halo: Spartan Assault is a good game for you.\n\n\n\n(I really wish it had multiplayer though, would buy a 4 pack, turn on Thunderstorm and Black Eye, and play with friends)","January 4","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This short game is not a prime example of a brilliant AAA title, but\n\n- it is really cheap\n- has a online ladder\n- a lot stuff to unlock and achieve\n- running on not so good systems and a good game for when you have nothing else to do\n\nThe story is short explained like every other Halo short story. Somebody attacks humanity, some elite group of soldiers (here Spartan IVs) are send to clean up and finally some heroic sacrifice (like in every halo title).\n\nThe gameplay is Halo 2D from above. You controll your character with the arrow keys and aim with the mouse. Being ported from the X-Box the game actually feels...good! I played through the missions without bigger problems, died from stupidity in some cases and managed to complete the game and 80% of the achievs in over 3 hours.\n\nBig minus are the tank controls. Like in Halo (PC version), the covenant tank drives like a charm, but the human tank is an uncontrollable mess. In this game, it gets worse. When you come to your one and only tank mission, you WILL totally loose it. instead of following your mouse like every other vehicle, the tank is controlled by the arrow keys and the tower follows your mouse. But W is not forward, W is driving up, A is driving left and...I think you got the problem. Having one vehicle with completly other controls is confusing as hell...\n\nBig question are the boosts you can unlock from missions to 1-time use them on other missions. If you fail to complete a challenge, you can farm XP on other missions until you have enough to buy 1-time use bonus equipment, like the spartan laser. Makes bossfights a lot easier. But is also...well...easy. I dont know what to think about it.\n\nI think I never had spend so well 3,50‚Ç¨. The game wasnt that great, but I finished it on the same day of installing and felt good after it.

Just.. no.\n\nI cannot actually comprehend how this has gotten so many good reviews. It is a boring, souless, money grabbing chore of a game that makes me so, so sad with 343. The entire thing feels redundant as all hell and has no substance what so ever. Quite frankly, if it didn't have the big bold text of 'Halo: Spartan Assault' written all over it, it would just be a cheap and nasty ported tablet game... Oh wait, that's just what it is with a Halo badge stamped on it.\n\nThe tiny drabs of poorly put together animated story cutscenes occasionally thrown in aren't even worth playing through to unlock it along the way. It's even worse with how badly it handles. Even for something that was formerly a tablet game, the fact they throw in background rockets and 'explosions' just to *attempt* to give it depth and remind you that it's a big, big battle you're in! shows how much of a sorry excuse this ends up being.\n\nThis has to be by far one of the worst top downs I have ever played, made worse by the fact that I had high hopes for it. If you enjoy something that makes you want to bang your head against a wall repeatedly, this is for you. I wouldn't even recommend it on sale.","April 7, 2015","false","1.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The story is mildly interesting, if unimaginative, and the cutscenes are ugly (but, like everything else in the game, thankfully brief). I only played with an Xbox One controller (acts like a 360 controller here), so I can't speak for the keyboard and mouse controls, but aside from the awkwardness of driving the Scorpion and the heavier, twin-barreled tank, the controls were fairly solid. Could have used an indicator for where you were shooting though, can be difficult to aim at times. The controller would vibrate for a set amount of time then stop, even if you were still doing the action that caused it to vibrate in the first place, though that may have been the Xbox One controller drivers and not the game itself, who knows.\n\nSkulls are essentially required if you want to be able to use better weapons throughout the missions, as the more powerful Sniper Rifle, Spartan Laser and Rocket Launcher are restricted to XP purchases. Basically, you get a certain amount of XP per mission, but it's so miniscule that it would take at least three missions to unlock just the 500 XP Sniper Rifle. By using skulls, you increase the XP multiplier, so you earn it faster and can unlock things quicker. Unfortunately, while the skulls made the earlier levels more entertaining by providing more of a challenge, the later levels got frustratingly difficult. If you enjoy that sort of masochistic challenge, by all means, put on whatever skulls you want (up to two at a time). It's not for me though.\n\nConsidering I love the Halo universe, I was really disappointed in this game. If you rarely get time to play any video games, it might be worth your time, but make sure it's on sale if you do decide to get it. I'd say five bucks, max. It seems to have been designed with mobile in mind, especially with the odd borders in the corners, but it works far better on here or the Xbox One. Trust me.

Halo: Spartan Assault is a game where you take control of a spartan via an aerial camera, there are 30 missions to complete, none are too complicated and all are action packed filled with alien ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• kicking fun! Some people may not like this game simply because the entire game is played with an aerial camera, but if you enjoy that style of game then this is perfect. As a fan of the Halo franchise I couldn't have been happier with this installment. If you enjoyed Halo, or want to get a little taste of what Halo is like, this isn't a bad start. $5 isn't a bad price to pay for this game at all.","April 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Surprisingly enjoyable, and that's coming from someone who got 1 level into Halo 4 before becoming bored and putting it down (Halo 2 is probably one of my favourite games of all time).\n\nNo idea if the story is canon but it's your typical Halo fanfare, very reminiscent of Halo Reach in that it follows non-MC spartans. Gameplay is twin-stick, but with identical controls to what is in Halo (at least if you play with a gamepad), making it very easy to pick up, with most of the associated weapons, grenades, vehicles and powerups that are in Halo. I guess this is as good as you're going to get for now, since Halo proper isn't coming to PC any time soon, but that this game is definitely worth the price, even not on sale.\n\n","September 28, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you love the Halo series, you'll like this. The $4.99 price tag ain't so bad either.","April 5, 2014","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

When I first started it up, there was no tutorial or even a simple tip guide. Another thing that REALLY bugged the hell out of me is that everytime you click to shoot, there is a short wind-up time before your spartan actually fires his gun. It's uh.... sort of a design mechanic? While it may suit mobile players, playing like that on a computer with a mouse, is a WHOLE different story. Imagine playing an FPS but everytime you click to shoot someone, there's a delay that'll get you killed. Spartan Assault has that issue and for me it's a turn off even though I LOVE Halo","February 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All the sounds and graphics just shows the Halo style, its fast-paced and fun, and there are no micro transactions involved so your paying for the full experience.\n\nThe story is fine, I just have one problem. Right at the start of the game, it tells you that this is all a simulation, and its a fun game that Spartans play in there spare time. This angers me. I don't feel anything for what the characters go through because I know that if I fail, theres no consequences what so ever. I know its a recreation of a past event, but still, let me actually be in that event, not some crappy simulator.\n\nIts worth your time and money, and has some interesting lore. But if your looking for a emotional adventure, play the actual Halo games.\n\nAnd Halo 3 please... you let us down with the xbone, this is the least you could do.\n","April 6, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zveir/recommended/277430/","Zveir","Zveir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zveir/","135 products in account","As a person who's first video game ever was Halo:CE on the original Xbox 12 years ago in 2001, I've spent the majority of my hours in my gaming lifetime playing inside the Halo series. I've clocked about 7K hours total in all the Halo games combined, and I'm extremely critical of anything Halo. Unlike most I won't say no just because this game is not an FPS, but I will look at it as a game in general. Halo Spartan Assualt is a simple top-down shooter that was literally made to pass the time when you are bored. This game does not have much depth to it, the story is based around past battles in the Universe and all the missions are "simulations" as all the virtual walls surrounding your play area identify.\nGraphics - For a $5 game that is also a mobile game, this game is beautiful. The ground textures look crisp, the animations are stellar, and it does a pretty good job of keeping your eyes glued to the game. The character models are fairly good, however the Grunts and Elites don't exactly look like their FPS counterparts in terms of color. Most of the Grunts are Yellow, and most of the Elites are Purple(Based on how far I've gotten in the game so far, will update once 100% done). This ticks me off because in the FPS versions, Grunts are Orange and Elites are Blue. On the lowest rankings that is. As of now there are no Red/Black/Camo Elites, but there are Gold Elites and White Grunts though, so that's a change.\n\nStory - So far, there is little. The Story is based around the Covenant breaking the Treaty it has with the UNSC by invading Draetheus-V and it's moons. This game is set after the events of Halo 3, but prior to Halo 4. This is the answer as to why the UNSC and Covenant where fighting when Halo 4 began. I'll leave the small details to you. But on terms of levels, the levels are layed out as Operations, there are 5 Operations total, each having 6 Missions in them labeled as (Letter) - (Number) to keep this simple. In the beginning of each of those 5 Operations is a well done cut scene expalining the next bit of the story. They're rather short, but get the job done. There hasn't been any voice overs mid fight, or much explanation other than the caption in each Mission before you start playing(they are interesting to read if you know the Halo Universe through previous games/books). Those captions add new Characters we have not seen before, such as Spartan Davis. I'm disappointed in the story, but for a game like this that was not intended to be very story driven it is understandable.\n\nGameplay - Ah, the important question. I'm not gonna lie, the gameplay is damn fun for this genre. This game has a solid feeling of when you hit something and when you do not, enemies respond accordingly to hits, and won't just immediately walk into your wall of fire from the UNSC/Covenant Turrets. Gameplay is fast and responsive, and it makes getting Killionaires and other high multi-kill medals fairly easy. One gripe is that there are missions where you actually do specific tasks like destroying AA-Wraiths or Escorting Wolverines, but there are others that have you survive for a certain period of time and wait until your ride comes to pick you up. In the mean time of that they throw countless enemies at you just to try to give you some entertainment. It felt like the Deadpool game in those moments(even though it was for only 3-4 minutes).\n\nAudio - I had to give this it's own segment, the audio in this game is amazeballs. It's really clear and great quality. But, they didn't keep all the original sounds from previous Halo games. The Shotgun sounds like something I've never heard before, and all the others sounds faintly similar to their FPS brothers. Obviously this is a different game, but it just didn't feel like Halo there.\n\nFinal Thoughts - For $5 this game really is pretty damn good. It's not the usual Halo experience(neither was Halo Wars but I enjoyed that game too) however it gave a great experience with a good bit of fun to be had. For this price, it's an easy buy for any Halo fan that wants another taste of the series.\n\n8.5/10","April 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I can't stand the fact that I paid pretty much anything for this game. Microsoft is just trying to squeak a few dollars out of the halo fans, and the screenshots/videos made it look a lot better than it actually is.\n\nGraphics: It's meant to be played on a tablet. 'Nuff said.\nSounds: The sounds you know and love, just very, very repetitive.\nStory: What?\nGameplay: Simple, boring, repetitive missions. Got through the first 5 missions, each one was pretty much the same.\nMultiplayer: None. This would've been a saving grace, because then at least I'd be able to get drunk and play with my friends. There's not enough bourbon in the world to make this fun by yourself.\n\nOverall: 2/10. It's halo. It's same old same old, but with a lack of story and multiplayer, the only two things that keep Halo from bargian-bin material.","April 12, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's debatable.\n‚Ä¢ It isn't very much like the other Halos, GUI is a bit different, music is a little different, as well as gameplay.\n\nAnd that's about it, I think I would rate this game at a 8/10(simplified 4/5). It's simply a good game, yet we would like to see better.\n\nAnd my personal note to Bungie: It was a stupid decision to sell the Halo title to 343 Industries, they ruined it in Halo 4.\n\nAnd my personal note to both Companies( 343 and bungie ): Please, make a port for Halo 3 with Multiplayer for Steam, everyone is wanting it, me myself would wish you guys would convert Halo 2 to Steam instead of Games For Windows Live. GFWL has horrible server stability, when Steam and Valve servers have much more stable and compact servers.","April 13, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

IT sticks with spartan ops in HALO 4, plus it would seem like it would go with the side mission sort of thing with HALO 5.

The game looks great, might be a little flat but for a top down shooter it is not bad at all.\n\nFor a port of a mobile game it still is very impressive the amount of detail they did put into the compat system: ie slower movment while shooting, great physics enjine, very resonable graphic options.\n\nI had no problems runing this game at 60fps at 2560x1440 with anti-lasing. really shows that even for a port of a mobile game that is baised on one of the best FPS games out there, they put a lot work making the game engine run smoothly.  which is quite rare for today as it seems that after Crisis, larger devlopers are willing to hold back on the demanding bit rates.\n\nConsidering my rig is 2nd gen i3 getting anyhting to run at 60fps at 2560x1440 is always impressive.\n\nLevels do seem a bit short, for as much quality time was put into this game there is a deep lack of multiplayer. Really wished the devlopers would have put in a CTF or DM mode not so different from the RPG classic Nox.\n\nThere is a leader board and weekly chalanges, I have not yet to try those but it seems like the kind of thing Arcade pros would love. Really a shame the PC version did not get 4 player co-op, really would have boosted my opinon of it as I am basically forced to do the whole thing alone.\n\nThis could have been a great co-op game, but alas it was intended for a mobile platform (possibly slacking off at work :D)\n\nSo for this game you do get what you pay for, which I paid about $2.50 on sale. It is a pretty nice package even though it is a little bit short.\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/recommended/277430/","anterk","Anterk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/","730 products in account","Spartan Assualt is truely a poor-man's Halo. An exceedingly bland story gives reason to the series of short missions avialable to you, each no more than ten or twenty minutes long. Shooting requires you hold down the fire button, an odd choice that ensures the player is always forced to forsee where the simply-minded enemies will go rather than shoot at where they already are. Mouse control is usually better than a controller because you recieve a reticle to help guide your shots. However, vehicles such as the scorpian tank and the ghost become incredibly difficult to control unless a controller is used, due to the translation from a fully 3D Halo environments to this isometric one, a potentially maddeding issue given that a least a few missions openly try to make you use these vehicles.\nThe average mission in Spartan Assualt is bland. The music is nice, but if you're a Halo fan you'll probably have heard it all before and, if you're like me, you might just find the music oddly out of place. Enemies are easily killed, so it really is a good idea to turn on a few skulls (alter the game to modify the difficulty). However, none of the skulls ever felt like a real solution, and even the skull that was directly related to increasing "enemy difficulty" just made all the enemies more bullet-spongy.\nIn similer games, such as All Zombies Must Die and Nation Red, there is a tendency to throw large waves of easily killed bad-guys at you. In Spartan Assualt, there are never that many enemies, and increasing the difficulty just makes the same brain-dead enemies slightly tougher (more health). Given that Nation Red and All Zombies Must Die already exist, and have working mouse controls, I can't recommed this game.\nMost importantly: if you're hurting for more Halo on PC, like I was when I bought this, you'll just end up disapointed.","June 20, 2014","false","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That same friend also gifted Halo Spartan Assault so a shout out goes to him for being a cool guy.\n\nHalo Spartan Assault is a Top-Down or Twin Stick Shooter depending on what you call it and centres around a story about Spartan Palmer who appeared briefly during Halo 4 and a faceless Spartan Davis trying to stop a Covenant from destroying a planet that contains Forerunner artefacts capable of destroying planets. The story isn't all too interesting but the cutscenes are presented well in a simplistic manner so it is enough to keep most people at least somewhat interested.\n\nCombat is nifty and you have several options of playing, I chose a controller but you're welcome to use a keyboard or touch screen layout. The game looks quite nice as you fight you will see Banshees and Hornets flying pass in the scenery which adds a layer of immersion. It reminds me of Halo Wars for the most part and also nearly everything feels like Halo which is a good accomplishment including gun audio, shields and enemy chatter. Except for the Drones, they make the sounds of the Alien Engineers which is a bit of a nitpick of mine.\n\nThe only real complaints other than two bull#%!$ levels is the lack of a Co-Op feature which these type of games begs for. The 360 and X1 versions have Co-Op but only online. Pure blasphemy. Also the levels were usually a bit too short (Though it was also for Windows Phone 8 so it sort of makes sense).\n\nThe presentation is nice, the story is a little boring and the combat is fun for the most part. But I would really only reccomend this to people who are big fans of Halo though the games works as its own story it won't keep non fans entertained. Still it's a nice little title to have and I give it a total score of 6/10. Go pick it up if you want to play something Halo related or enjoy Twin Stick Shooters.","January 18, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While this game is clearly an ios port, and don't get me wrong I have nothing against that, it doesn't stand up to games of a similar play style hence the comparision to Guardians of Light. To put it simply this is a quick and boring game. Halo fans might get something out of it but I believe they will be in the minority. Games like this are meant to be played in 5 minute blasts while waiting for a bus and when you port games like that onto PC or consoles then they become quick and uninteresting because they're not designed to hold your attention for long periods. That being said I picked this up for about 50p so on that basis it's good.\nOh and it has some of the worst handling vehicles I have ever come across.

It's one of those games that starts off enjoyable and borderline fun but because of repetition and other issues it gets unbearable.\n\nIt seems pretty short and could easily be beaten in a couple hours, but those couple of hours will be repetitious and infuriating. Top-down shooters are nigh impossible for me on a keyboard so I used a controller and noticed that :O is my controller broken? There are dead zones in the movement stick! Oh wait I go play any other game and it's completely fine. This makes the movement absolutely annoying. The 4 diagonal "corners" bug out and stop when the stick is moved there and you only make these movements when you're in combat.\n\nWith the hardest "skulls" enabled it's a breeze, but. BUT.\n\nThe levels are shorter than 8 minutes meaning it'd be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to bother putting checkpoints in. But there will be some levels where it is so easy to die a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t death which means :O you were inches from the end of this pile of tedium and :O now you're back at the beginning and have to replay 7 minutes. Even though these levels are short and very similar (go here, shoot things, go here, shoot things, maybe get in a vehicle, shoot things, go here, survive for x time, follow these things and don't let them die, shoot things). This leaves you with an artificially long ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• annoying game that shouldn't exist on anything other than your crummy phone and releasing it on Steam means that people who want a modern Halo will buy this because :O I want teh halo but :O it's crap.\n\nI want to finish this because I wasted measly $$$ on it and just so I can be free of it, but there are so many better things to play/watch/eat/defecate/ingest/inhale/exude.\n\nIt's like using a pine needle to get an annoying popcorn shard out from between your teeth and having that feeling of satisfaction for getting it out but it's not worth going through 24 pine needles, having bleeding gums and mouth splinters for a few moments of minor satisfaction.\n\nYou say Halo and I say goodbye.\n\n4/10 would not repeat again","October 16, 2014","false","5.7"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

Obviously more interesting levels would boost the whole thing even more but that would take more than a little artwork and programming.\n\nSo as of now, for 5$, Spartan Assault is a nice mini game for Halo-Fans, but if you aren't into the franchise you have no reason to pick it up.","April 5, 2014","false","1.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

Spartan Assault takes place between Halo 3 and Halo 4, you play as Spartan Palmer and Spartan Davis, protecting Draetheus V from a Covenant rebel invasion. Forgetible plot. The Original Quake had a better story. So this game is a top down shooter, it plays nicely. WASD to move, and mouse to aim. Alot of the guns are full auto, before you start a mission, yoy can change your loadout, with XP points you get for playing, there is a sniper rifle (Thankfully is not full auto) , spartan laser and and a full auto rocket luancher... WTF. Armor ablilities, and sadly no reloading, what is this, Doom? It sounds like i hate this game, i like it! its short, but fun! The mission can be dumb as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• however. like "STAY AT YOUR POSITION FOR X AMOUNT OF TIME AND WAIT FOR X, AND FIGHT OFF COVENANT" it's annoying, but decent.

Since it had the Halo name I knew I had to buy it and try it out, and for $4.99 there wasn't much to lose. For that price it is well worth it. The gameplay is solid and everything runs smoothly does what you tell it to do without any problems. There is also some variety in weapons and vehicles so don't expect to just use and assault rifle and walk around the whole time. The artwork and cutscenes are done well and it adds more lore to the Halo Universe so if you are interested in that this could be enticing. There are some other features like leaderboards that add replayability.\n\nWhile I doubt any new Halo games like Halo 5 or the rumored Halo 2 Anniversary will be on Steam hopefully in the future more Halo games will be available on the PC.","April 6, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Regretfully it's one of the worse purchases I've made.\n\nIt runs like junk on integrated GPU's (tested with HD4000 in 1080p) even though it's originally a game for smartphones. Just saying.. If you have a beefier GPU there will be no problems, but it shouldn't be necessary seeing the graphical fidelity of this title. Options menu lacks a bit, and the menus in general are quite annoying to navigate.\n\nThe most important thing for me though, since this game lacks in so many aspects: I'm not having fun, not having a laugh, not having a good time, not having a blast - not even remotely. The game itself is VERY dull and OBVIOUSLY catered towards casual smartphone gamers. It just lacks the soul of the entire franchise.\n\nIf you're looking for a PC game with PC values, avoid this. If you're looking for a mindnumbing waste of time, play Bejeweled instead, it's a lot more satisfying..\n\nIf you want an assesment of what this game has to offer from another, more positive viewpoint, I recommend you go watch TotalBiscuit's 'WTF is...' about the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF1EA71nDA4\n\nEducate yourselves before you toss your money at something.

The gameplay rotten! The story Terrible! The AI is so easy to kill so the devs say "I know lets make the guns suck to level it out!" The game lasts only 2 hours but for ¬£4 thats alright. The game also has good tanks but since there is no difficulty settings anywhere the enemy tank are like lego! The ending is a vertical line upwards in difficulty and the end cutscene is terrible! The turrets are overpowered nearly 1 shot kill. There is no character development at all. The friendly AI is so overpowered they keep taking your kills meaning you don't get points for them meaning getting gold star ranking is near impossible. The graphics are slightly above average so that's good.The gun buying system is so bad that they are overpowered but are horribly overpriced, the cheapest thing is 250 XP but for each level you get an average of 50, meaning that to insta-kill the boss , (which there is only 1 by the way),you need to pay every level and get a silver ranking.The cutscenes in the game are so boring you just want to skip them instantly.

It's been years since a Halo game made it to PC and they choose a top down shooter. I was so excited. I've given up on Xbox for the most part. But they brought one of the franchises I really care about to steam. And it sucks. None of the great FPS action that defined the Halo genre. Sorry dudes. Bring Halo 2 (Yes I know it's available for vista I'm on 8) or ODST, or  3 Or Reach, Or 4. Or 5. Please bring a decent Halo game to your PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME (I.E.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/parkerberlin/recommended/277430/","parkerberlin","parkerberlin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/parkerberlin/","18 products in account","I've been a huge Halo fan since the very first Combat Evolved on Xbox. This was mainly due to the epic story line. The game in itself, the back story, the history of your main character. Just the whole thing. I even guessed that the humans were or interacted with the forerunners in 2003 (not hard since 343 recognized our species). I've even read 2 of their many  books. I've owned and played every Halo game even the somewhat lame ones (Halo ODST & Halo Wars, not bad games just nothing compared to the rest). I was very happy to find Halo Spartan Assault on Steam.\nIf you're a fan like me then this game is a must have and since it's only $4.99 there's no real reason not to get it. I traded a game for it, a game I earned for free so even if you don't have money this is still obtainable.\nI like top down shooters and this one runs incredibly smooth. The story takes place in between Halo 3 and 4 and focuses on the newer batch of Spartan II's. The game is a challenge if you try to obtain gold for every level and there are over 30 levels.\nYou play one of 2 Spartans back and forth as you complete missions. You only control your character but I think that's part of the fun (more like Halo 1-4 except not FPS). Board any vehicle and take your pick from nearly all of the UNST and Covenant weapons we've come to know in the previous games.\nThis isn't a long game and the replay value is moderate if you're a fan, but its a great arcade style of game play. Not complex and easy to learn.\nIf you're not a fan but you're looking to spend $5 on a decent game this is a good choice and it has trading cards that are selling in the Steam marketplace for a good amount at the moment compared to other cards.\nIf you're a fan then this game is a must have. Great visuals and more Covenant domination at the hands of the Spartan II's.\nMy only wish is that they made the game longer but for the price and the style of game that it is the length of the game isn't a surprise. Also even if they made the game with 100 levels I'd probably still want more... :)","February 1, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/recommended/277430/","bizargh","Bizargh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/","118 products in account","Before I proceed with My Review, just a quick tip to increase your money's worth:\nIf you head to "Steam > steamapps > common > Halo Spartan Assault > Data", you can find the game's music files, among the cutscene dialogue and a few other Sound FX. they're in OGG format, which can be opened & played in such programs as Audacity (A Popular Free Audio Editor, which you can then use to convert to your favourite audio file format such as .MP3, .WAV, .FLAC, etc)\n\nThey're not as high quality as the Official Soundtrack release due to being compressed for the game's highly efficient size, but not only can you find a numerous amount of tracks/mixes not included in the Official Soundtrack album, it can certainly give you a bit more money's worth from the game, especially as the game itself is cheaper than the Official Soundtrack album (Which can be digitally downloaded from iTunes, Amazon MP3 & other Music Retailers), which I can actually recommend you buy, because Tom Salta, the composer, does a surprisingly damn good job with the music! (I even consider it one of the game's biggest highlights, despite not being as notable as the works of Martin O'Donnell & Michael Salvatori)\n\nMy Review\nHalo: Spartan Assault is a surprisingly competant designed-for-mobile top-down shooter which may be a very short-lived experience with not a great deal of replay value & even less narrative content, it's certainly very gentle on the wallet & surprisingly translates the Halo experience into a new genre pretty well.\n\nIt controls well enough on Mouse & Keyboard (With fully rebindable keys aside from "Fire Weapon", "Throw Grenade" & "Pause" locked to the left & right mouse buttons & escape for odd reasons), but you certainly can't go wrong with a Gamepad. Just note that the weapons obey an automatic fire-rate with occasional fire-delay depending on their power or behaviour, so don't be shocked if your Shotgun, Pistol or Rocket Launcher doesn't fire a single shot on the click of a fire button like I was. It's part of the game's weapon design, but it's not what I consider a very responsive one for those expecting to fire in single-shot.\n\nAnd to clarify, there are none of the microtransactions as seen & negatively received on it's mobile release. The XP Points used to buy even more powerful weaponry & abilities for single mission use is earned based on in-game score, which became an enjoyable resource management system for myself. Don't worry, as long as you score big on your missions & spend wisely, you won't have to do much to maintain your XP Points. Otherwise, you won't need to do more than replay a mission you do well with more than twice to supplement your XP Points.\n\nIt's also worth noting that it unfortunately doesn't include the Co-op mode that was added to the console ports, so you'll be shootin' solo.\n\nStory wise, it's basically a Training Simulation recounting a battle that took place between Halo 3 & Halo 4's timelines, where you as the player strive to earn your gold stars on the very short but numerous levels, with Skulls aka Difficulty Modifiers to provide score multipliers & greater challenge and the previously mentioned arsenal of more powerful bought-for-single-mission-use weapons & abilities to customise your more varied mission-assigned loadouts. There's not really much more to it than that.\n\nAll-in-all, if you need something cheap & cheerful and quick to install to kill some time or satisfy a need to shoot lots of bad guys, you can't go very wrong with Halo: Spartan Assault! It's not a big recommendation, but there's very little preventing me from doing so.\n\nSide Note: I wouldn't suggest purchasing it solely as a means of encouraging Microsoft Studios & 343 Industries to consider returning to porting the main-series Halo shooters onto PC. The enthusiastic result of Halo: Spartan Assault's debut on Steam has so far only lead to a follow-up, "Halo: Spartan Strike" being made & coming to Steam on launch.\nA progressional result nonetheless, but I would suggest a more specific method to advocate your desires to see such games as Halo 3 be ported to PC & distributed via Steam.","December 26, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Felt like once you played a full chapter you end up with a sad "been here done that" feeling to the game already. They do have different objectives to keep it slightly interesting (defend a wall from a swarm of jihad grunts, or seek and destroy "x" things), but overall I was rather saddened that it was largely forgetable. I don't hate it, its just... not your mom's cooking thats all. I was a massive fan of HALO before Bungie left the franchise, to me this game is just not HALO.\n\nPROs:\n> Good Sound: Nails the effects perfectly from the console series, from the assault rifles thunderous bursts to the warping plasma pistol overcharge.\n> Weapons: If you've played a HALO game before, you can expect the weapons to act EXACTLY the same.\n> Enemies: Again, are as expected from a HALO game, grunts crap themselfs and run where elites stand and "WORTWORTWORT!" from the back of the lines until you pop their shields.\n\nCONs:\n> Vehicles: Can be a chore to control properly, leaving to a lot of panic in the thumb sticks when the action gets heavy.\n> Lack of Purpose: Felt like a simple cash grab as their is no real purpose to the story (its basically a "look what this person did back in the battle of BLEH)".\n> Experience: Rather silly that you can only purchase weapons and upgrades for ONE mission only. I just stuck to the default stuff and picked up guns as a ran through the levels.\n> Short: You'll probably kill through this in about 2.5hrs if your a decent shot with your thumbsticks.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n> Get it while its on sale: I got it for $1.49 during the christmas sale, there is NO way I'd pay anymore for this.\n> If you like HALO and GYOMETRY WARS, buy this... just don't expect the "cool factor" to last past the first chapter.","December 26, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much the only Halo experience on PC.\n\nThere is a 6 sections each and 5 missions with in each section.\nEach mission is straight forward and can be completed with in 5 minutes.\nI finish the game in 4 hours, but the re-playablity is high.\nFor each mission you can turn on skulls, 7 to choose from; but can only\nhave 2 active during the mission.  You can also spend XP you earn in the\ngame to upgrade the mission loadout of weapons that are default.\nFor example, your primary is the assault rifle; you can spend your XP to\nupgrade to 1) sniper rifle, 2) spartan rifle, 3) rocket laucher. You can\ndo the same for your secondary.\nEach mission you are scored on each enemy that you kill, the medals\nyou earn, and for completing it as fast as possible. Giving you a bronze,\nsilver, or gold star for each mission.\n\nOverall I enjoyed playing this game. The controls are tight and responsive.\nThere is a satisfaction in using each weapon. (All weapons have made it\nover, mostly, even the focus rifle!  I mean the tickle rifle! Who doesn't love\nthat weapon, let's face it that gun is worthless. You spend all the energy\nthat gun has to offer and it's enough to kill 2 elites, and maybe 1 grunt.\nGarbage! Pff! The nerve the coventant have. Whose bone headed cousin\ninvented that rifle only to have his more succsessful brother greenlight it\ninto production. Then come to find out the spartan's use it to play tag with.\nI'd love to be a fly on the wall in that follow-up metting:\nHead bossman tentical face - So how's the focus rifle out on the battlefield?\nAshamed brother - Oh! Ummmm, good. I ... I ...I mean it could do better.\nHead bossman tentical face - Better? How so?\nAshamed brother - Well, for one it could start by killing the enemy.\nHead bossman tentical face - What!?\nAshamed brother - Yes, well, it seemes that, cough, umm it appears that it\ndoesn't actually kill the enemy, actually.\nHead bossman tentical face - Pff! Doesn't kill the enemy? Well then what\ndoes it do?\nAshamed brother - It, uh, it, swallows pride, it tickles the enemy.\nHead bossman tentical face - You must be joking. Great scot! So you're\ntelling me that the coventant has a weapon\nthat just tickles the enemy?\nAshamed brother - Yes. Yes we do.\nHead bossman tentical face - Does it at least tickle the enemy to death?\nAshamed brother - Yes! Wait, no. No, doesn't do that. Would be nice.\nHead bossman tentical face - So then what's our plan of action?\nAshamed brother - I believe to keep, using, the weapon?\nHead bossman tentical face - Well, I doubt that would make us lose the war.\nNext order of business. Can someone please\ninform the grunts that, yes, while we all have a\nlaugh when they put a plasma grenade in the\ntoilet to scare everyone it's starting to stink up\nthe place and it's causing the flood.)\n\nIn conclusion, very nice game.","December 28, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easy 10/10 for what-it-is (Mobile Port). Very fun. Seriously hope Vanguard puts out another full-length one!\n> Didn't quite scratch my 'FPS' itch (since it's a TDS), but it came surprisingly close... still haven't had this much fun with Halo since CE (#‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•).\n> This game is a steal at $5. At &1.49... it's a Goldman-Sachs.\n\nSummary:\n> Halo-themed top-down shooter, featuring Spt. Palmer from Halo 4, and all the usual suspects for baddies.\n> 30 short, satisfying missions.\n> Mouse to aim, WASD to move. ALL typical halo weapons up to Reach, 'Nades, Melee. Vehicles. Loadouts. Armor abilities. Medals n' stuff.\n\nThoughts:\n> 60 minutes in, I realized that I had happily fallen into the exact same subconscious shoot-nade-melee dance that I deveoped playing Halo CE all those years ago :]\n> Combat makes emptying your Assault rifle clip FUN like not since Halo 3/CE. Good pace, well-balanced... even with every combination of skulls!\n> Was made with love: good original music / cinematics / world & level design / ambiance.\n> Attention given to TINY game details... you'll see when you play.\n> AI is SOLID - like the best of CE and 3 put together, with EVEN fewer bugs.\n> Marines are actually durable and useful.\n> Only saw three small bugs the whole game.\n\nGraphics:\nTo me, there are two types of People when it comes to Graphics:\nA] "The Fetishists", who try to assuade their deep despair that the gaming industry has barely innovated for the better part of two decades by convincing themselves that a game is 'good' if it uses the newest, hyped-up, AAA-studio Graphics Engine.\nB] "The Realists", who care about Immersion, and graphics are merely a means to that end, whether 8-bit or Frostbyte.\n\nIf you're a Fetishist, you will be disappointed at anything... So ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off.\nIf you're a Realist, you'll realize this game's graphics are attractive, made-with-love, conducive to the gameplay, and immersive.\n\nConclusion:\n> This is what a game should be.\n> Hats off to 343 and Vanguard, and to Microsoft for getting the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of the way for once and allowing this thing to be born.\n> Though doubtful, let's hope 343 allow this mere mobile-port to remind them of what a Halo game should be.","December 29, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a top down shooter version of Halo, but with no real story.  No plot, no persistent upgrades (there's a handful of generic upgrades you can buy PER MISSION, but you'll almost never be able to afford them), no RPG or rogue elements (didn't expect any, but the story is supposed to make up for that in action games).  Missions are 1-10 minutes long at most, unless you're REALLY horrible.\n\nEssentially, you take a 1st person shooter, strip out aiming, crouching, running, cover, and just about all other skill related aspects, but don't replace them with RPG/rogue elements like you might normally see in similar top down games.  You really aren't left with much.\n\nStarted getting bored by the lack of...ANY substance at about hour 1, but for $1.50 I guess I expect that.\n\nThe sad part is that they have to be losing money on this game at even full price of $5.00, and it COULD have been a much better game with just a little work.

This was mainly due to the epic story line. The game in itself, the back story, the history of your main character. Just the whole thing. I even guessed that the humans were or interacted with the forerunners in 2003 (not hard since 343 recognized our species). I've even read 2 of their many  books. I've owned and played every Halo game even the somewhat lame ones (Halo ODST & Halo Wars, not bad games just nothing compared to the rest). I was very happy to find Halo Spartan Assault on Steam.\nIf you're a fan like me then this game is a must have and since it's only $4.99 there's no real reason not to get it. I traded a game for it, a game I earned for free so even if you don't have money this is still obtainable.\nI like top down shooters and this one runs incredibly smooth. The story takes place in between Halo 3 and 4 and focuses on the newer batch of Spartan II's. The game is a challenge if you try to obtain gold for every level and there are over 30 levels.\nYou play one of 2 Spartans back and forth as you complete missions. You only control your character but I think that's part of the fun (more like Halo 1-4 except not FPS). Board any vehicle and take your pick from nearly all of the UNST and Covenant weapons we've come to know in the previous games.\nThis isn't a long game and the replay value is moderate if you're a fan, but its a great arcade style of game play. Not complex and easy to learn.\nIf you're not a fan but you're looking to spend $5 on a decent game this is a good choice and it has trading cards that are selling in the Steam marketplace for a good amount at the moment compared to other cards.\nIf you're a fan then this game is a must have. Great visuals and more Covenant domination at the hands of the Spartan II's.\nMy only wish is that they made the game longer but for the price and the style of game that it is the length of the game isn't a surprise. Also even if they made the game with 100 levels I'd probably still want more... :)","February 1, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is a ton of fun, the visuals and music are incredible, and overall it's just a really well-polished game. The campaign isn't all that long, but there are a lot of different optional things to do, so completion will take considerably longer than just playing through the game.

Easy 10/10 for what-it-is (Mobile Port). Very fun. Seriously hope Vanguard puts out another full-length one!\n> Didn't quite scratch my 'FPS' itch (since it's a TDS), but it came surprisingly close... still haven't had this much fun with Halo since CE (#‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•).\n> This game is a steal at $5. At &1.49... it's a Goldman-Sachs.\n\nSummary:\n> Halo-themed top-down shooter, featuring Spt. Palmer from Halo 4, and all the usual suspects for baddies.\n> 30 short, satisfying missions.\n> Mouse to aim, WASD to move. ALL typical halo weapons up to Reach, 'Nades, Melee. Vehicles. Loadouts. Armor abilities. Medals n' stuff.\n\nThoughts:\n> 60 minutes in, I realized that I had happily fallen into the exact same subconscious shoot-nade-melee dance that I deveoped playing Halo CE all those years ago :]\n> Combat makes emptying your Assault rifle clip FUN like not since Halo 3/CE. Good pace, well-balanced... even with every combination of skulls!\n> Was made with love: good original music / cinematics / world & level design / ambiance.\n> Attention given to TINY game details... you'll see when you play.\n> AI is SOLID - like the best of CE and 3 put together, with EVEN fewer bugs.\n> Marines are actually durable and useful.\n> Only saw three small bugs the whole game.\n\nGraphics:\nTo me, there are two types of People when it comes to Graphics:\nA] "The Fetishists", who try to assuade their deep despair that the gaming industry has barely innovated for the better part of two decades by convincing themselves that a game is 'good' if it uses the newest, hyped-up, AAA-studio Graphics Engine.\nB] "The Realists", who care about Immersion, and graphics are merely a means to that end, whether 8-bit or Frostbyte.\n\nIf you're a Fetishist, you will be disappointed at anything... So ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off.\nIf you're a Realist, you'll realize this game's graphics are attractive, made-with-love, conducive to the gameplay, and immersive.\n\nConclusion:\n> This is what a game should be.\n> Hats off to 343 and Vanguard, and to Microsoft for getting the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of the way for once and allowing this thing to be born.\n> Though doubtful, let's hope 343 allow this mere mobile-port to remind them of what a Halo game should be.","December 29, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a top down shooter version of Halo, but with no real story.  No plot, no persistent upgrades (there's a handful of generic upgrades you can buy PER MISSION, but you'll almost never be able to afford them), no RPG or rogue elements (didn't expect any, but the story is supposed to make up for that in action games).  Missions are 1-10 minutes long at most, unless you're REALLY horrible.\n\nEssentially, you take a 1st person shooter, strip out aiming, crouching, running, cover, and just about all other skill related aspects, but don't replace them with RPG/rogue elements like you might normally see in similar top down games.  You really aren't left with much.\n\nStarted getting bored by the lack of...ANY substance at about hour 1, but for $1.50 I guess I expect that.\n\nThe sad part is that they have to be losing money on this game at even full price of $5.00, and it COULD have been a much better game with just a little work.  Add some persistent stats/upgrades and you'd have a $10 game at least, and it wouldn't have taken much work.  Meh.\n\nRecommended ONLY on sale.

But that is my opinion. I have played the whole campaign and I would give the game a 7/10. The game lasted (for me) about 3 hours of campaign but I begun to lose intrest near the end as I had a little bit of trouble completing the last level. I managed to complete it by purchasing some upgrades. I have little if not no complaints about the acctual game. I do wish they put more work into the enimies a little more. I say this beacause all purple elites have plasma repeaters, and all red elites have focus rifles, etc. If the enimies had a little more weapon and rank variety I would find the game much more interesting. I was a little upset to find that there were no hunters in the game. I couldent help but notice on one of the posters/pictures (before and after the realase) had a large hunter in the background. For one thing hunters are not that big, but secondly it was not even in the game. My second but petty issue was the tank driving was a little funky but I managed to drive it without too much issues. Do not approach this game as "Its a new halo game" Approach the game as "its a mini halo game" beacause you will be dissapointed. This may sound incredibly negitive, but I acctually enjoyed the game to some extent for its entirety. The end put me off a little and seemed rushed. But if you are thinking about buying the game I reccomend it.

Well, for me, it went great.\n\nFor a top-down shooter, it's a really great game. It may be a tad bit easy, but have there been ANY hard top-down shooters (Besides Space Rangers. I loved it.)\n\nAlright, so, let's review the plot first, shall we?\n\nThe events occur around 2554 (UNSC military calendar). You are placed in the boots of either Spartan Edward Davis or Spartan Sarah Palmer, depending on the mission. Draetheus V and its moon, X50, are under attack by Covenant cultists, led by Parg Vol and Merg Vol. They seek a Forerunner device on the planet, but encounter fierce UNSC resistance. The battle drags on, and the UNSC utilizes some weapons and vehicles that the Covenant haven't seen yet, or for a long time. In the end, the UNSC wins the bloody battle, but at the cost of hundreds of brave Marines and Spartan Edward Davis.\n\nIn the beginning of each mission, you get to choose your loadout, albeit, at a cost. If you had exceptional records in your previous mission, you can access either a rocket launcher, the one-shot-wonder (Sniper Rifle) or the Spartan Laser. You can also activate skulls for additional difficulty and increased rewards.\n\nThe only downside of the game is that it's a top-down shooter, and not a full-scale FPS or a TPS. Also, the vehicle controls can be very difficult and/or sluggish at times and it will be brutal to maneuver out of a Mega Cannon's firing lane, especially in narrow corridors.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who considers himself a true Halo fan. It's not a massive Halo game, or Halo 4 on PC, but it's definitely something. Let's hope Microsoft finally understands the value of moving Halo to the PC.","October 3, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/recommended/277430/","bizargh","Bizargh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/","118 products in account","Before I proceed with My Review, just a quick tip to increase your money's worth:\nIf you head to "Steam > steamapps > common > Halo Spartan Assault > Data", you can find the game's music files, among the cutscene dialogue and a few other Sound FX. they're in OGG format, which can be opened & played in such programs as Audacity (A Popular Free Audio Editor, which you can then use to convert to your favourite audio file format such as .MP3, .WAV, .FLAC, etc)\n\nThey're not as high quality as the Official Soundtrack release due to being compressed for the game's highly efficient size, but not only can you find a numerous amount of tracks/mixes not included in the Official Soundtrack album, it can certainly give you a bit more money's worth from the game, especially as the game itself is cheaper than the Official Soundtrack album (Which can be digitally downloaded from iTunes, Amazon MP3 & other Music Retailers), which I can actually recommend you buy, because Tom Salta, the composer, does a surprisingly damn good job with the music! (I even consider it one of the game's biggest highlights, despite not being as notable as the works of Martin O'Donnell & Michael Salvatori)\n\nMy Review\nHalo: Spartan Assault is a surprisingly competant designed-for-mobile top-down shooter which may be a very short-lived experience with not a great deal of replay value & even less narrative content, it's certainly very gentle on the wallet & surprisingly translates the Halo experience into a new genre pretty well.\n\nIt controls well enough on Mouse & Keyboard (With fully rebindable keys aside from "Fire Weapon", "Throw Grenade" & "Pause" locked to the left & right mouse buttons & escape for odd reasons), but you certainly can't go wrong with a Gamepad. Just note that the weapons obey an automatic fire-rate with occasional fire-delay depending on their power or behaviour, so don't be shocked if your Shotgun, Pistol or Rocket Launcher doesn't fire a single shot on the click of a fire button like I was. It's part of the game's weapon design, but it's not what I consider a very responsive one for those expecting to fire in single-shot.\n\nAnd to clarify, there are none of the microtransactions as seen & negatively received on it's mobile release. The XP Points used to buy even more powerful weaponry & abilities for single mission use is earned based on in-game score, which became an enjoyable resource management system for myself. Don't worry, as long as you score big on your missions & spend wisely, you won't have to do much to maintain your XP Points. Otherwise, you won't need to do more than replay a mission you do well with more than twice to supplement your XP Points.\n\nIt's also worth noting that it unfortunately doesn't include the Co-op mode that was added to the console ports, so you'll be shootin' solo.\n\nStory wise, it's basically a Training Simulation recounting a battle that took place between Halo 3 & Halo 4's timelines, where you as the player strive to earn your gold stars on the very short but numerous levels, with Skulls aka Difficulty Modifiers to provide score multipliers & greater challenge and the previously mentioned arsenal of more powerful bought-for-single-mission-use weapons & abilities to customise your more varied mission-assigned loadouts. There's not really much more to it than that.\n\nAll-in-all, if you need something cheap & cheerful and quick to install to kill some time or satisfy a need to shoot lots of bad guys, you can't go very wrong with Halo: Spartan Assault! It's not a big recommendation, but there's very little preventing me from doing so.\n\nSide Note: I wouldn't suggest purchasing it solely as a means of encouraging Microsoft Studios & 343 Industries to consider returning to porting the main-series Halo shooters onto PC. The enthusiastic result of Halo: Spartan Assault's debut on Steam has so far only lead to a follow-up, "Halo: Spartan Strike" being made & coming to Steam on launch.\nA progressional result nonetheless, but I would suggest a more specific method to advocate your desires to see such games as Halo 3 be ported to PC & distributed via Steam.","December 26, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Felt like once you played a full chapter you end up with a sad "been here done that" feeling to the game already. They do have different objectives to keep it slightly interesting (defend a wall from a swarm of jihad grunts, or seek and destroy "x" things), but overall I was rather saddened that it was largely forgetable.

Game has replay ability kinda , Every mission can be done on bronze , silver and on gold medals , so if you will miss few rounds and get silver or bronze and will want to have everything on gold you will replay it , otherwise game does not have any other reason to replay it. Game has good potential but it is wasted on stupid pointless missions where you just kill all enemies on map or destroy few covenant tanks or turrets. You can`t customize your character , you just customize loadouts and choose few skulls for missions. If you are fan of Halo buy it or if you are just bored and want to try something new buy it but on sale. Game in general is fine , it is fun for few hours, then it just gets boring.","September 18, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound effects are kind of cheesy compared to the rest of the Halo franchise but they work.

Unless you're a hardcore completionist, you're going to run out of things to do. Every level has stars for how well you did, but they don't have any real impact on the game. It also features weekly and daily challenges to do, but again they don't have any real impact. It would have been better if we could have different armour and weapon unlocks, allowing us to change our Spartan's look or start levels with different equipment combos. I understand we're supposed to be playing to specific Spartans, but honestly who cares? I'd still rather be able to change the look of my armour than worry about sticking to cannon. It's the same thing that's bugged me in nearly every Halo game except for one. (Sorry, but I've never found the MC's look all that special.)\nAlso, something else that's disconcerning is the lack of multiplayer. This game would have a much greater replay factor if I could play it with friends instead of always playing solo. The fact that it doesn't have any makes you wonder why they didn't think to do it.\nIn the end, I would recommend this game for a fun, one-time playthrough, but the lack of options, customization, and multiplayer leads me to not fully recommend it.","November 26, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes many characters, weapons, and vehicles from other Halo games. Halo: Spartan Assault is a top-down shooter making it similar to Halo Wars on Xbox 360. The controls are very simple and are not difficult to remember like some games. The story isn't very long but you can always go back with different weapons, armor abilities, etc. As a Steam Trading Card user I only buy games with trading cards available, hence why I purchased this game. I have a three year old trash laptop and it can run this game which I was impressed by. For $4.99 this game is well worth the money!","November 29, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
