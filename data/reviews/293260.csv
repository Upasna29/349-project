You play all of your action through cards that obtained from equiping items. So, different items had different cards.\n\nPro :\n1. Free to play with cash to speedup your progress.\n2. Excellent Multiplayer with automatic matchmaking, ladder, rewards, etc.\n3. Easy to learn, hard to master.\n4. Excellent Singleplayer/Coop campaign.\n\nCon :\n1. Currently only 3 class and 3 races. Based on D&D mechanic, this is rather small\n2. There is no way to gain cash currency for free other than joining guild (Five 5$ redeemable coupon that only guild master decide who gonna get it). You only get what they give it to you while doing tutorial (spend it wisely).\n3. Some dungeon are locked with cash currency. While there is no item that cannot be obtained by free players, the locked dungeon guaranteed to get an epic item for the first time completed.\n\nSome tips :\n1. Choose your starting party wisely. While you can change it anytime you want, it can be a hassle to level up it again. A popular combination is dwarf warrior, human priest, and elf wizard but I dont recommend it (see tips 2). My personal favourite is elf warrior, human priest and gnome wizard that kinda hard early on. Check the wiki for some insight. http://wiki.cardhuntria.com/wiki/Cardhuntria:Community_portal\n2. You get a free multiplayer pack at Renown 5. Try to raise your renown to that level by doing campaign first. The pack is consist of dwarf warior, human priest and elf wizard with reasonable equipment to get you started multiplayer. Multiplayer character is interchangeable with the campaign character, that is why I suggest not to take that character as your starting character because you get it free later. But, recruiting level 1 character is only 10 gold. So do what you seem it fit.\n3. A lot of people is asking this, so I gonna write it here. You can start selling your equipment at Renown 7. I dont recommend to sell equipment because you maybe need it sometimes later for the campaign.\n4. When you get your pizza, the game make you spend it at that time. Just dont ! Close the client and you get the pizza without spending it. You can spend it later for whatever seems the best for you.","July 26, 2015","true","19.5"," 182 of 196 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","182","196","9","0"

The loot is varied and interesting. Which makes you want to play more. But as soon as you get into multiplayer, you quickly realize that you need to pay in order to compete. The prices are steep too. Balance is nigh impossible because of how the game is centered around card drops.\n\nSingle player campaigns are a grindfest. Campaigns are well made, and the level design is well thought out. They are fun, interesting, varied and challenging. Unfortunately you need to pay to proceed to higher level campaigns. After buying the campaign you still have to grind, pay to grind. There is a 1 day cool down and wait to for all the campaigns too.\n\nThis game has so much potential if it do away with the f2p model and just be a proper paid subscription game.

Loot that is trumped by shop gear which costs you hundreds to thousands of gold to buy, but then is sold for 2... 2 gold.\n\nAnother annoying "feature" is that players quit the game when you're winning and you have to sit there for 2 minutes waiting when it is clear that they aren't coming back.  The game has a 20 minute timer that is laughable. Most players are quick and every now and then you need some time to think, but then there are the players that spend what seems like ages trying to make up their mind on how to move... And this is even in the higher ranks where you're supposed to be playing against players who earned their way up in rank. But this could be another side effect of the pay to win mentality of the game.\n\nIt grasps you for a while but then it just stalls at this pay to win ceiling that makes the game hard to enjoy, then you get the slow players that make you feel like scratching out your eyeballs. 4/10.","March 7","false","121.8"," 147 of 192 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","147","192","2","8"

If you're looking for a good, fun board game/card game/strategy amalgamation, this is a pretty sharp little package.  The script is witty and funny, the gameplay is tight and well-designed, the game looks beautiful in it's simple cartoon style.  What's not to love?\n\nThe problem is the way the financial end is set up.  Now, you can play through the single-player campagin and have all the fun you want with multi-player for free... but if you want to play the additional Treasure Hunt add-on content, through the base game and its two expansions, the in-game pricing is $20+$13+13, for a total of $46!  I felt bad about getting so much fun out of this game for free, and was looking to throw the developers some cash.  I also wanted to complete all of the Treasure Hunts and get the achievements for doing so.  But no way in hell am I paying $46 for it.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of $10-$15 sounds about right, and maybe $5-$10 if you could grab it on a Steam sale.\n\nBut it won't ever be on a Steam sale, because the prices are all in-game.  The Steam page simply lists it as a free game, without the pricing tiers or the ability to buy it from Steam.\n\nAnd to be honest, some of the other the achievements are practically an impossibility.  It's pretty rare to get an epic item, and more difficult to get a legendary.  I have a handful of epics after 80 hours game time and maybe 2-5 legendaries.  But to get the hundreds listed as a part of the achievement?  Probably won't ever happen.  Especially if you're not paying a monthly membership fee on top of everything else, which gives you an additional piece of higher level gear with every loot chest.  It's a fun game... but it's not big or deep enough to keep me playing for dozens to hundreds of hours a month as a part of some subscription model.  It certainly doesn't have the scope that World of Warcraft did back in its day.\n\nThe devs would have kept me playing longer, and spending some money, if they hadn't made the non-free full version so ridiculousy expensive.\n\nSo enjoy the campaign, get what you can out of it, and be done with it.  If you really want to give the devs some money, you can always buy in-game currency to unlock a few of the Treasure Hunts or a couple of extra costume/characters.\n\nUPDATE:  I had originally given this a marginal thumbs down, but just recently changed it to a thumbs up because of the comments from Sgt. Buttersworth [308] below.  It turns out you can get all of the DLC for cheaper than the fees they charge in-game buying them separately as stand alone bundles.  My advice is to check out the game for free.  If you like it, by the time you start hitting the optional add-ins, the thing to do is click on the pizza slices at the top menubar.  Instead of buying the Basic Edition for $20, the AotA Bundle for $13, and the Citadel Bundle for $13, simply buy 690 slices of pizza for $20.\n\nYou can then use those 690 slices of pizza (plus the pizza slices you get from playing the free part of the game) to purchase the treasure hunts in bundles at the following rates: 300 for the Basic Edition treasure hunts, 150 for the AotA hunts, and 150 for the Citdel hunts.  This will get you all of the expansion DLC for $20 instead of $46, and you'll still have some extra pizza left for a few costumes.  Certainly not as many as if you'd bought the DLC's separately, but they're all cosmetic & ultimately unnessary imo.  You also won't have access to the one-month Club memberships that will give you extra loot, but those are also not necessary.  If you want to spend the $46, you can, and the difference will be a bunch more figures/costumes, and three months of Club memberships (one month for each of the bundles).\n\nI'd say that $20 is more what the game is worth, and for that price you can pretty much experience everything the game has to offer.  You can always buy the Club memberships later with additional pizza.  80 pizza will get you a week (and if you don't buy anything else, you'll have enough pizza left for a week membership with the 690 you've bought for $20).  After that, it's about 300 pizza per month with pizza priced at 330 slices for $10.\n\nSo to sum up... play the free game.  If you like it, buy all of the treasure hunts in pizza bundles after buying 690 slices for $20... which will also afford you a 1-week Club Membership.  After that, $10 will give you a month of Club Membership if you desire to keep it going, with some pizza leftover each month.\n\nPurchasing that way will give you a better deal than buying all of the bundles for cash at a total of $46.","September 4, 2015","true","81.4"," 70 of 88 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","70","88","0","11"

Good challenge!\n- Very cool ftp model. You can have tons of fun without spending a penny, even in MP.\n- Simple and effective UI and HUD, I appreciate how devs sped up certain parts and made the game smoother. PC card/tabletop games usually have those extra unnecessarry animations. Not here though.\n\nCONS\n- Currently there are only 3 classes (and 3 races). The game balances it by forcing you to regularly revise and rebuild your deck to optimize it for various scenarios, so it doesn't get boring too quick. Couldn't find any info if they will add new ones.\n- Because of how the base game mechanics work (SP), they don't work that well in MP, especially in Co-op mode. Only one player can play per turn, so it could get a bit stale for others. Still, if you play with friends you won't mind it too much.\n\nDefinitely recommending, if you like Hand of Fate, Guild of Dungeoneering, Talisman - you'll love this.

Literally everything looks like you're in for a D&D session, or some other tabletop RPG. Even the NPCs can strongly resemble some of the nerds from your surrounding!\n- Chest-opening addicts, brace yourselves. This game is incredibly generous in terms of giving you loot. Leagues for 50 gold (slightly more than what a Rare Treasure gives you) rewarding you 3 of these (at least) for just... signing in. One-per-day adventure with enhanced loot that's same for everybody (ergo can be found by someone else and everyone will have it in that place), one-per-day adventure with treasures only, this time it's different from person to person, chests with guaranteed rares for MP wins...\n- THE COMMUNITY. Good lord, that's one friendly community. I've yet to find less toxic place in the internet. Open chat, greet people, ask questions, have them answered... that's just something amazing.\n- The competitiveness of the multiplayer. People think something like "Legendaries give you better stuff, after all it's a F2P game." Couldn't be more wrong, in fact 90% of the legendaries are below mediocre. And so, people can get to some decent-high ranks playing with items that are RARE at most. And, as you'll find out if you play the game, it's raining rares there.\n- No P2W aspect. The only thing a person who paid money gets are costumes for heroes (meaningless in fights), chests (you can get a lot of them from many different sources and they don't guarantee you anything amazing), Treasure Hunt adventures (items from these can be dropped just by playing and it's as likely to happen as a drop of any other item) and Club Membership (which only gives you +1 item per SP or MP chest, doesn't include league chests and it's another item of the highest rarity the chest gives. Ergo gives you more items, but not BETTER items.)\n\nSo what's the catch?\n- Prepare yourself mentally - this game is a card game WITH DICE ROLLS. And it doesn't use Pseudo-random distribution. What does that mean for an average player? You can be on a freaking amazing luck streak, you can be on a horrible loss streak. It happens and you need to be prepared for it.\n- Seriously. DO ASK people in chat before you decide on doing something important - spending pizza, buying an item from a shop, selling an item, etc. This game is helluva confusing thing for new players and while the tutorial maps in SP kinda explain a small bit of the game, the larger picture needs to be... learned by heart, basically. You'll quickly learn why you shouldn't sell any of your items before you've maxed out on them or why having a lot of movement is a good thing.\n- I could probably suggest you visiting forums. No, not steam forums, the CH forums. You can find them by getting into options in CH and clicking the "Forum" button or googling them. I've learned A LOT about the game that way and probably wouldn't stick for as long as I had.\n\nStill, it's free. And it's amazingly good for being free. I don't see a reason to not give it a try.

I think I need assistance on this review, so let me nab this radish farmer to help me get my thoughts out.\n\nOriginally posted by Gaming Peasant: Wha is dis den?\nCard Hunter is a High-Fantasy, Card-based TBS/Pen 'n' Paper RPG.\n\nOriginally posted by Gaming Peasant: Den its' a casual bloke's DnD den? Why are yas playing dis?\nAh, but that is where you are wrong. Yes, it's High-Fantasy, but that is not quite the setting. You are a guest in the home of Gary and Melvin. Gary is a beginning Game Master (GM), and Melvin is the assholish, but veteran, GM. Gary is the one hosting this game and running the singleplayer (according to my playtime spanning across two days), while Melvin is the prime definition of a neckbeard that needs to remember that games are supposed to be fun.\n\nOriginally posted by Gaming Peasant: Roight, so it's not a standed computa game. How does it play?\nGood Question, my Linen-garbed friend!\n\nThe game is sectioned into rounds. Each player takes turns, playing a single attack, movement, or spell card per turn. This continues until one player is out of action cards, and passes. If the other players have action cards, they can continue playing until all are out, which the final person to pass declares the round as ended.\n\nOriginally posted by Gaming Peasant: Sounds simple. methinks there is more to dis den dat!\nYou have no idea. There is a ton to manipulate and do and use to your advantage, from trapping floors and laying curses upon your foes, to Objectives within the field of battle. Adding to the mix are Traits and Handicaps, which can buff and debuff your team and your enemies to turn the tables in your favor!\n\nOriginally posted by Gaming Peasant: Okay. Carry on, I need some amusement while I harvest me crops.\nAt the beginning, you recruit three party members. You can choose from 3 races and 3 classes. This may seem a little lackluster, but this actually keeps things simple enough for the novice RPG player, and yet still adds a good amount of strategy to your party.\n\nDwarves are very tough, but are slow. Humans are decent in both movement and toughness, while Elves are very fast and have the bone structure of a sparrow.\n\nOriginally posted by Gaming Peasant: Wot of magic usage? Most of dese type of fings 'ave them differ in ability...\nThat's the cool thing. All 3 races are completly capable of rocking out as a mage due to how the magic and attacks are handled.\n\nThis leads me to the classes; The Warrior, the Paladin and the Mage. Sorry, thieves, the healer is more important, and Elf Warriors are pretty much the same.\n\nThe Warrior is able to wear heavy armor, can wield THREE weapons (Maybe the dwarves have prehensile beards?), and generally hit like a speeding truck.\n\nThe Paladin meshes Might and Magic nicely, heals and buffs their teammates, and can even lay down the smiting via curses!\n\nThe humble mage is a master of long-distance combat, but shines when you can hurl opponents with Telekenetics, block pathways with lava flows, and fling all sorts of elemental bolts, among many, MANY cooler things!\n\nOriginally posted by Gaming Peasant: How easy is it to pick up? me kin may try dis!\nAll that is needed is a basic reading ability, and elementary arithmatic for planning.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow let me get to the F2P aspects:\n\nIt is handled almost as good as Team Fortress 2 before the Robot Update.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/recommended/293260/","ARANimate","ARANimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/","214 products in account","Card Hunter is a combination of a traditional collectable card game mixed with tabletop gameplay delivered to in such a wonderful presentation.\n\nPresented in the form of a tabletop game board, each campaign is several levels or floors deep. Pitting you up against different foes with different sets of cards.\n\nYou are introduced to all the mechanics in a great way using the early missions as their conduit. You'll also unlock each of your starting party members one at a time over the course of the first hour or so of the game. Each of the character classes are: Warrior, Priest, Wizard and each of those can be one of these 3 races: Human, Elf, Dwarf. This gives you a chance to learn the basics with each one as you play. Tutorials tend to make or break strategy games, but Card Hunter does it in a simple and engaging way.\n\nThe single player campaigns are all a part of an overarching story where the brothers Gary and Melvin take a tongue in cheek approach of the dungeon master and player roles. This makes each encounter feel like a real tabletop RPG, especially with the art assets and introductions for each campaign.\n\nEach of these campaigns is picked from an overworld map that looks like an actual paper map with little dungeons and shops that pop up as you progress. The attention to detail is one of the things I find the most fascinating about this game. Each character, game piece, card all look like real game pieces. Blue Manchu did a great job with the art direction on this and it shows.\n\nThe gameplay here is the star. Mechanically it's very deep, with 1000's of items that alter your deck. Instead of the traditional collectable card game trope of opening card packs and building a deck. You instead must equip each of you characters with one of those many items. Each item is a set of cards for your deck. So as you outfit your party with better weapons your card pool will get stronger as well. These items are obtained from completing the single player campaigns, playing multiplayer, or purchasing chests with a paid currency.\n\nBy making the deck building mechanic tie into the itemization of your party it makes you make decisions that normally you wouldn't do. As you progress, each character is given a certain number of major and minor power tokens, which gate the gear you can use. You will find some of the best loot requires some of these tokens when you're equipping your character. This prevents you from making a character to powerful. Much like traditional tcg's or ccg's would limit the number of copies of certain cards in a deck, this mechanic is essentially doing the same thing. Though what happens here is it forces you to make some tough decisions. For instance, do you equip the laser weapon with 6 awesome attacks or the divine item that gives you some extra heals. The way this customization works adds a nice layer of depth to the strategy of this game and one of the reason it has such replayability.\n\nBesides the free content there is also 3 versions of paid content purchasable from inside the client. The Basic Edition for $19.99, the first expansion Attack of the Artifacts for $12.99 and the most recent expansion Expedition to the Sky Citadel, also $12.99. Each of these packs adds new campaigns, new items (which means new cards), new enemies, and new costumes.\n\nIn the newest expansion, Expedition to the Sky Citadel, your campaign is against the GM - Cardotron 2000. Adding content from levels 18-21 and also proving you with a level appropriate party in the event you are not level 18. This content is hard, at least the first of the six treasure hunts was. In my first attempt at it I lost several times. Hopefully I can get some more loot and try going at it again.\n\nI know this is getting lengthy but there is also a well integrated multiplayer portion to Card Hunter. With ranked leaderboards, custom multiplayer maps and a separate load out for your party. You can play individual ranked games to prove your worth or join a ranked league where you play a set number of games in a certain period of time for rewards. The multiplayer seems balanced, although I haven't played enough of it to be 100% sure.\n\nOverall, For a free to play game it can go one of two ways. Lot's of content locked behind paywalls, which make the game feel pay to win. Or a ton of content for free with paid options to progress faster. Luckily they went for the latter. It's always a plus when a free game goes that route, giving you plenty to do and then entices with new content to make you to want to support the game. Card Hunter brings a free, fun and unique card game/rpg to you and presents it in such a charming way.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JPJ8GNgCSjY\n\nFor More Reviews and the Bi-Weekly Podcast\nEarly Access Media[www.earlyaccessmedia.com]\nYouTube\nPodcast[www.earlyaccesspodcast.com]","August 26, 2015","true","5.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

If even the positive reviews express frustration at the RNG then you know it's a problem. Forget about strategy and deck-building; getting a beneficial draw is so unlikely that I fail even in lucid dreams of the game (which after nearly 300 hours there are many).\n2. Distribution of the card types attached to equipment is made with neither rhyme nor reason, causing unneccessary limitation and imbalance. Your warrior can choose 1 of 52 different martial attack items which buff everything from bash, chop, and penetrating attacks to bash, chop, and penetrating attacks. Do you like fire? Lucky you; you can load your wizard with 2 staves and 4 arcane items providing fire magic cards to be buffed by your pyrocentric arcane skill. Do you prefer electricity? You can go to hell; there are some nice shocking staves but not a single 1 of over 200 arcane items adds lightning attacks.\n3. The game has been ensorcelled by dark magic to compel people to keep playing even as they rail against it.

Too much reliance on getting good results from random rolls/draws/loots.\n\nFrustrating as hell to be in a difficult fight, and your warrior draws no attacking cards for 3 rounds in a row, while at the same time your healer doesn't draw any healing cards. And when you do finally draw that much needed attack card, your opponent blocks it with an armor or shield card.  It's worse than bad rolls  in a real DnD game. Here you have to randomly get the right card, then if the target has armor or a shield, you have to randomly succeed against his block.  In DnD you can always move and attack, and even if your attack rolls were bad, you weren't hamstrung by not having a card that allowed you to attack.\n\nIf you were unlucky not get good loot drops, it makes your life even worse.  Your cards available to you are dependant on the loot you get. Also loot that worked well in one adventure, may not work well in the next one.\n\nThe game won't let you sell usable items for quite a while into the game. Meaning you have tons of junk in your inventory that you'll never use and can't sell to buy stuff you really want.\n\nThe sterotypical dungeon master schtick with Gary and Melvin is amusing at first, but after a few adventures you start wishing they'd just shut up.   The whole cardstock aesthetic has it's own charm too.\n\nNaturally being an online game you have to deal with full servers or servers being down.\n\nIt's worth trying for free, but I'd rather play a proper traditional RPG than this, personally.  It's kind of funny to me, that I feel like I would like this game better if I had never played actual pen and paper RPGs before.","July 17, 2015","false","6.7"," 52 of 87 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","52","87","0","0"

Have you ever spent hours upon hours playing D&D along with friends? Then stop reading here, Card Hunter is the game for you!\n\nCard Hunter smartly mashes elements of both Collectible Card Games and Table-Top games, layering those with colorful characters and lots of humor, making fun of most common tropes about roleplaying. Finally, all of that is sprinkled with a myriad of references to gaming and pop-culture, resulting in a carefully crafted and absolutely charming experience.\n\nThe Single Player campaign is well put together and satisfying: the lower level adventures serve as a basic tutorial to the most important concepts of the game, easing the player into the ins and outs of an otherwise complex and deep game. As you keep going through the Campaign's story, the game slowly ups the challenge level, so the player is presented with a rewarding experience without feeling too overwhelmed. Wanna know what's best? You can tackle the whole Campaign cooperatively together with up to 2 of your friends and other fellow players, so you're not forced into playing the game on your own even if you don't like PvP.\n\nFinally, if you like some good competition, you can jump right into Multiplayer mode and bring-it-on against other players. The MP mode features an automatic Match-Making System, so newer players are pitted against opponents of roughly the same skill level, making ranked matches much fairer.\n\nThere's a ton to be liked in Card Hunter and, while this certainly isn't a game for everybody, I'd seriously encourage all Steam users into at least giving it a try. The game's free to play, and the devs really do get the f2p model right. Not only can you play the game without ever spending a penny, if so you desire, but you're never faced with artificial pay-walls. Some game content (a few adventures and skins to customize your in-game characters' appearance) is accessible by paying-customers only, but free-players can otherwise access every item and card in the game via regular play alone, no microtransaction needed, minimizing the pay2win issues most similar games suffer from.\n\nI'd also like to vouch for the indie developer making the game and the awesome community surrounding it. If you like your games to be frequently updated with bug-fixes and balance-changes, I assure you'll find all of that in Card Hunter. The devs also regularly work on new content to be added along with updates, with a big expansion usually being released once a year. If you try the game out and do like it, I strongly advise you visit the official site and join the forums there, as those are filled with great info and lots of people ready to help and very welcoming towards to new players.","July 25, 2015","true","29.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

You go through questing modules and collecting loot to of course upgrade your own equipment and play through the storylines presented.\n\nIt's a charming game with simple but good graphics, a solid foundation for gameplay, and plenty of quests available. You do not seem to be hampered or stopped by paywalls, which seem to only be there to allow you access to more loot, cosmetics, and at times to unlock some new adventures. Not that you -need- those adventures, you can do just fine without them, but it does seem like it would be a good idea to get them at some point.\nIn game, you will find the movement and combat to be intuitive, with all moves being detailed on cards you play it is easy to look up what something does, and you won't find yourself blindsided by surprise gameplay changes. It's all about knowing your tools and using them well.\nFor the looting fans, you can spend your gold to buy extra loot chests, and for those who love to optimise everything there is a good variety of equipment available that is sure to get you exactly what you need to build your dream team.\n\nWhile it starts a bit slow, it builds up quickly and gets in full swing fast enough to be comfortable without any moments where the difficulty hits you on the head.\nI haven't even tried the multiplayer yet, but with the solid base this game has, co-op, and ranked play I seriously doubt I would be disappointed.\nEdit: Checked out multiplayer, am not disappointed.\nAnother edit: Not all is fine with this game. Login queues are a thing, and it seems to be online only. This wouldn't be a problem if they had a 'cancel' or 'quit' button on the queue, but ctrl-alt-del is the only way out\n\nAs a summary, Card Hunter is a great tactics game with good atmosphere and as opposed to many 'free' games, this is actually a game you can play for free and enjoy.

The name is slightly misleading as there is no card collecting.  Cards are made available through many hundreds of items.  Deck building is done by equipping items to characters like any other D&D inspired game.  But unlike other D&D inspired games, the effectiveness of each item depends on how it synergises with other items.  An item with powerful cards will be balanced by also containing a number of weak cards.  All items are available for free and will drop randomly just by playing the game.\n\nMany of the Steam reviews suggest this game is pay to win.  This is simple not true.  I became a top 10 player without spending a cent*.  I have seen some rich players dropping hundreds of dollars to fast track their item collection.  But you cannot buy any specific items.  So money gives them very little advantage.  Any seasoned player in the world chat will tell you the same.  You must grind your way to the top and this is a good thing.  The match making system makes use of Elo ranking, and will prevent you from playing against an experienced player that will definitely win.\n\nIgnore the negative Steam reviews.

I do. But I've hit a point where all I can do is repeat a handful of vexing missions against what seems like ridiculous odds and can't seem to advance anymore. I am glad I only put a little bit of money into it because I think I'm done with it. As an example, I am a full level above one of the Treasure Hunt missions but cannot make any headway- the enemies have an endless deck of huge area effects that generate difficult terrain and they themselves have Hover. It gives a hint- to get robes that have Hover! Well, that's great, but I don't have any and at the time, there wasn't any in the stores that I could find, either. On top of that, it only means my squishy Mage gets Hover, since that effect only comes in robes, and then only if I happen to get that card at some point during the battle while the mage is still alive. I constantly find myself with Warriors that have lots of movement cards but no offense, or lots of offense but no movement. Another Treasure Hunt mission has my characters two full levels above the level requirement and is a capture-the-flag type mission with one victory space. Only the defending monsters are ridiculous, two of them have a seemingly endless supply of poison dart ranged weapons, the other two fly, have twice as many hit points as two of my three characters (and have one-and-a-half times that of my fighter), and a huge melee attack they always seem to have at the ready. If I am lucky with drawing movement cards, I can get within a few spaces of the victory square before my last character dies, or I take a slow approach, keep my characters alive, but lose on points. Twice I actually got a character on the victory space, right before death, and both times by the time I had gotten there, killing that character was the last victory point they needed to win. What else am I supposed to do? There are two missions a level below me I have beaten and two missions a level below me I can't beat (not to mention the level 7 treasure hunt two levels beneath me I also can't beat). Is this it? I really want to like this. I love the old-school-DnD art and tabletop RPG look but the puzzle-nature of the game coupled with needing just the right cards (that you may not even have access to) puts this soundly in the "dislike" category. At least it is essentially free, though I did buy the Basic pack (and am regretting it now). I just can't recommend it.","November 2, 2015","false","37.2"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","27","44","0","0"

This is true, but for a free game, there is a worthwhile and in depth story line that harkens back to the old 1st edition D&D fights of yesteryear - where not everything was beneficial and luck was truly random. I would recommend that you do NOT spend any pizza that the game gives you until you have completed all the scenarios - about 25 hours worth - Then it will cost very little to pay for any expansions you may want.","April 21","true","125.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The prices are too steep, so don't buy anything, it won't be worth it. They missed too many simple things to warrant asking for purchases.\n\nIts fun at first when you play with friends but the grind is real. The prices are a little too steep for me for the what you get. The game missed alot of simple things that would help, such as  tile labeling for communicating with friends. The blocking cards on the AI are pretty OP, they roll a block at least 60% of the time and usually have 3 or 4 of them while none of mine really ever blocked. You reach dead ends that you have to grind 5 or 6 times before you can progress, which is around the 7-10 lvls. I havent gotten past lvling my group to 11, because I get too bored. I recommend downloading it for a quick go to game, but once you get into it a ways in you will get bored. If you buy any of the in game transactions you really wasted money. I could've seen myself spending $5 back when I thought the game was fun, but $20? LOL. I'm glad I don't have buyers remorse. I want to get to the higher levels featured in the screenshot, but theres absolutely nothing that will keep me playing this game for that long. The grind is WAY to grueling.\n\nA year later I remembered this game and picked it up again, they seem to have fixed the unfair rolling tables. I still find their prices extremely laughable. Plus for all the 'is it pay to win' confusion, it's a 'pay to not grind' so you get things much more quickly. All who find this not helpful are those that paid $100 and are salty about it lol","August 19, 2015","false","64.5"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","35","60","2","1"

I probably have 1000+ hours in the game if you include the web version.\n\ntl;dr: Neat CCG game that is free-to-play and *not* pay-to-win. Extremely fun and unique game with a cool retro feel, but can be overly random, imbalanced, and frustrating at times. If you enjoy CCGs and some light RPG stuff then check it out.\n\nObviously I'm a bit biased (both having played the game since beta and contributed published content), but I really enjoy the game and the unique things it brings to the Collectible Card Game (CCG) based format. Unlike many other CCGs, this game is absolutely NOT pay-to-win. In fact, some of the top rated players have never spent a dime. The content you purchase is really just for cosmetics, extra single player levels, or small boosts to collecting speeds (like 15% boost, which is not much at all). If you enjoy the game you should support it not so you get stuff, but so Blue Manchu can keep making new content.\n\nThe game is basically a mash up of a CCG with miniatures. You use cards to control the miniatures in an arena combat. Levels will often have interesting challenges that you need to overcome, with unique cards that can drastically change how you need to play. There's a decent amount of depth in when to play what card, when to pass early, and how to manage character facing and position. There's a lot to love, a lot to learn, and a lot to master.\n\nWhile I do love the game, it isn't for everyone. It skins itself as an RPG, but it is much more a deck building / CCG style game. Some single player levels are extremely difficult and require you to rework your party just to overcome the challenges. Don't view it as an RPG where you get your stuff and slowly get better replacement gear -- almost every item has a use in some situation (even the super bad items are useful once you finish the game for Quests). This is both good and bad as it requires you to tailor your builds to the level, but also results in often playing a single player level just to immediately lose due to not having the "right stuff" equipped.\n\nOutside of that, my main complaints about the game is that it is a bit too luck based and imbalanced. There is the obvious card drawing element, but then there are dice rolls where a single one can make or break a match. Additionally, there are a few balance problems with some cards being overly dominant. If you're a hardcore CCG fan who wants to create an undefeatable build then the multiplayer game probably isn't for you. Yes, top ranked players are consistently top ranked (I was #1 for quite a while), but that doesn't mean you won't lose matches against bad players just due to sheer dumb luck.\n\nOverall, the game is very unique and fun. Since it is free there isn't much cost in trying it out. If you enjoy CCGs and have a nostalgia for old school RPG tropes then this game is perfect. I'd recommend people check it out even if you're on the fence.

Card hunter is somewhat between slow and fast paced tactical/rpg hybrid, has a very good atmosphere, and for those who were borned in the 80' (or 90') and had experience with tabletop-rpg, can bring back memories.\nThe indivudal adventures in average can be done between 5 and 10 minutes, so if you haven't got all day for gaming, this is just made for you. Grab your pizza slice and beer and do some good old rpg.\n\nI have only encountered one downside of the game so far....but dude, that downside is like an avalanche. Yes! Yes, those who are playing this, know what I'am talkin about. The card drawing/luck system. Thats where the sh*t hits the fan. If you gonna play this, be prepared, even if you gonna choose a dwarf warrior, there will be hunders of battles where you gonna draw 3 move card in uncountable rows of rounds. Why? Dunno.

Free to play.\n\n2. Not true pay to win. You can unlock extra missions and treasure hunts with pizza, which is purchased with real cash. There is also gold used for items and chests (which can drop random gear, including the best). They give you enough pizza to unlock quite a bit of the end-game treasure hunts just by playing through the campaign, if you hold onto it. Gear drops from chests at the end of matches, and it's quite random with the loot drops (RNG). Everything can be obtained without a single spent penny.\n\n3. Gameplay. Think your traditional grid-based tactics game... with cards. Instead of having set attacks, you draw cards each turn and that is what you have for that round. The cool part is that each character draws cards, and the cards in each characters deck are dependent on what gear you have equipped. Equipment in this game gives you various cards (which are your attacks and skills) instead of traditional stats\n\n4. Campaign is a bit entertaining, sometimes repetitive, but good. Once you finish the game, you can redo any mission with special challenges that must be dealt with. These missions give you good loot drops.\n\n5. Multiplayer: This game has 2 and 3 player co-op, as well as true 1v1 pvp. 2 player allows for an additional card draw per character to make up for the lack of numbers. It's an absolute blast. There is also true pvp multiplayer, which is ladder/elo based. In this mode, everyone is given 3 characters to use that are higher level (once you unlock them in the campaign), or your own characters once you finish leveling them.

Also, inventory and equipment management is a hassle. There's a bunch of stuff that's labeled as useless and only able to be sold but there's also many different variations of them turning your inventory into a sack full of useless junk. I think it would have been way easier to just have given the player gold directly instead of having them waste time on figuring out whether something is equipment or junk. I digress. The game itself is entertaining so if you can get past the inventory and mulitplayer/co-op issues you should be alright.\n\nOh and microtransactions are shoved in your face... so that's annoying. In a regular game you would fight a boss and get rare or higher rarity loot. Well, in this game instead of getting that loot it's withheld from you and you're asked to pay for it with real money as if the game is giving you this amazing bonus but in fact they just took a slice out of the content (no pun intended)--such a simple game feature at that--and are asking you to pay $$$ for it... then again you could argue that it's a 'free' game... but still, quit shoving your sticky pizza in my face.","May 6","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Here's some obvious features u can experience even as a new player:\n1. Tons of collective cards which u can combine them with different strategies in game.\n2. Never feel boring and always being shocked by some new ideas or play-style in pve, especially pvp.\n3. Randomess and even some rpg- style makes the boardgame quite unique.\n4.

Great dev. team always add some new things to the game and try to make it's a better world.\nThere're more about the game, but that wait's u to find out. The game itself has a steep learning curve, one needs to learn lots to master the game system.\nHowever, in my opinion, I hope to see the game system much more complicated and more elements which can freely utilize in future.

It's a game that strikes a good balance between card and board game. Needless to say I enjoy it.\n\nIt is also one of the few F2P games that I have thrown money at because I was enjoying it. Their F2P structure is quite fair. Most of it revolves around cosmetics which are really only for the cool factor. There is a subscription option that you can take for as much as 30+ days or as little as a week. Which really only gets you a piece of bonus loot at the end of a quest. Most of the times that bonus loot is OK but not mindblowing, so it isn't as if they are trying to bait loot you into subscribing. There are also Treasure Hunt maps that have a guarenteed one time drop when you first complete them. That one time drop will also show up as RNG loot throughout the game (quest level permitting) as well as cycling through the merchant shops for in game gold. I've also personally never been huge on most of the Treasure Hunt loot, I have personally fount it to be mostly OK but I seldom if ever use it. The Treasure Hunts for me are mostly for the fun of the quest.\n\ntl;dr, the F2p aspects of this game are in no way pay to win and don't feel forced.\n\nThe PvP is even fairly fun, assuming you dont run into the flavor of the month team or have built a deck to counter said build. Ususally seems to be three dward wizards. I've found myself physically kringing when I load into a PvP match against them but there is something especially satisfying when you emerge victorious or better yet make them rage quit because your deck is set up to be viable vs other builds but almost completely shut them down.  PvP also has a pretty good reward chain. At least for the first 6 chests after which it really depends on if you are still having a good day or not.","July 14, 2015","true","660.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This Dungeons and Dragons-themed title melds customizable characters and roles with a combat systems that can be learned with very little play time. There are little-to-know pay-to-win features, utilizing the in-game currency (pizzas) for mostly cosmetic character items; pizzas can also be earned at certain points of the game, and players should not find it truly necessary to purchase theses pizzas unless they wish to support the developers in this admittedly fun title. This game can be quite humorous, and the dialogue and text can be quite interesting, so that is another plus.\nHere are just a few reasons to Roll for Initiative in Card Hunter:\n\nGameplay - Card Hunter utilizes a grid in which to structure battles. Depending on which stage the characters find themselves in, hostile figures, obstacles, and backdrops will differ from previous encounters. There-in lies a question directed from new or potential players: what determines the actions player characters can make? Each character-individual forces when enemy non-player hostiles are involved- has their own deck of cards which define specific actions, maneuvers, and attacks that specific figure can perform. Once a player performs an action with a character, the enemy does so, and so on; these phases of actions continue until both sides pass their turns consecutively, in which both forces must discard cards until each individual figure has, at most, two cards each. This mechanic was likely implemented to entice players to commit to actions while not hoarding cards for later turns in a battle. The main objective, however, is to eliminate the opposing force by reducing each of their figure’s health to zero or below, or by other means described in scenarios within a campaign. There are also multiple races-humans, dwarves, and elves-in which players can add in any combination to their party, as well as varying classes that can be assigned to them.\n\nItems - You may have heard mentions cards and asked yourself, “Why is this not a card game? Why is this portrayed mostly as a grid-based strategy game throughout this review?” To answer these questions, Card Hunter does feature cards that dictate actions and a maneuverable gird to which to strategize, but cards are obtained much differently than in traditional trading card games. In-game items are given to players after each battle as loot and there are varying slots in which they can be assigned; they also retained individual rarities and levels so that players can grade and compare cards that can be placed in similar slots on the player’s characters.\n\nCharacter Leveling - As players complete adventure paths, their individual characters gain experience which boosts health points and possibly opens up item slots that allow characters to expand the card count and variability in their decks. For example, at level five my dwarven fighter now has the capacity to equip three weapons, as well as a martial skill and other helpful items which grant bonus cards and traits. Though leveling is a somewhat slow process, this is compensated by the abundance of quests that are granted to the player upon completing others; these quests also have a daily reset allowing players to complete them only once daily, but so many quests open up at once that this hardly presents an issue-after three hours of play I found no need to revisit on of my previously completed quests.\nTheme - Card Hunter is a pretty blatant Dungeons and Dragons-themed title. The game’s Dungeon Master is named Gary after the legendary Gary Gygax, dice rolls are mentioned frequently in accordance to mechanics within the original roleplaying game, each adventure path’s synopsis and art is based on classic modules; it is fairly obvious yet awesome.\n\n\nTL:DR - Card Hunter has a few features that could possibly mark it as a ‘fee-to-pay’ title, but after five hours of total play I have not utilized nor have I felt it necessary to utilize the paid functions of the game. This title is extremely fun, though I have not yet had the opportunity to experience either cooperative or player-versus-player online features; I cannot accept nor deny the credibility of the online community. Card Hunteris recommended for those who enjoy card- or grid-based strategy game. Also, if there are any new or existing players who would like to play cooperatively but do not know anyone else who plays, I would gladly join in. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

Most of you are liable to HATE it, 'cause it ain't exactly "flattering" to gamers, but like Taxi Driver before it, it's one of those films which allows you to gaze at aspects of yourself unflinchingly in a mirror, and decide which bits you'd like to keep and which bits you maybe, just maybe, should try and change about yourself.\n\nBut I'm getting way, WAY too "deep" here, especially for the game I'm about to review.  So let's skip, if we may, to a particular scene in said movie, in which our anti-hero/"gamemaster", named Scott, rants at some poor kid (who wants to join his tabletop gaming group) about the evils of video games which purport to be "role-playing games", when they lack what he believes to be the core ingredient of such games: "Communal storytelling."  Now, whether or not you agree with Scott over how important such things are in the grander scheme of life, there's no denying that no video game ever has had, or ever will have, the "depth" of storytelling and character which a bunch of people sitting around a table with pen, paper and dice can achieve.  No matter how advanced and "clever" computer programs might get, they'll never be able to improvise action or explore characters to the extent which a group of switched-on, imaginative, flesh-and-blood human beings can.\n\nOf course video game "RPGs", however erroneously named, have absolutely no NEED to aspire to such heights, because they have OTHER things going for them.  They're more visual, more aural, more immediate...hell, you don't even need any FRIENDS, 'cause they tend to have single-player options.  Video games have a LOT of things going for them which old-school RPGs don't; just as surely as old-school RPGs have their own strengths when compared to video games.  So what does all this have to do with Card Hunter, the video game I'm allegedly reviewing here?  Well, I could let the devs themselves answer that question for you, but since you're stuck with me, I'll continue putting things in my own words.  But in order to do this, I shall also have to touch upon the "evolution" (or "de-evolution", depending on your point-of-view) of the (in)famous Dungeons & Dragons game.  Sure you've heard of it.  The people who made Card Hunter certainly have...\n\nD&D began as the purest of tabletop "role-playing games"; perhaps even the ORIGINAL of its species, unless I'm mistaken.  But what is even more important to note is that, since its inception in the 70s, D&D has gone through many different permutations (including the ADVANCED D&D, or AD&D, system), and while I've only "seen" and have not actually played more recent editions, the general inclination in recent years has been to make D&D more, I dunno, "accessible" to new audiences I guess, by pushing it in a slightly more "board game"-ish direction.  Card Hunter takes things one step further still by adding even MORE blatant "board game"-y elements, like, well, CARDS (oddly enough, given its title)!  And again, "accessibility" would seem to be a key word in their thinking herein.\n\nThey've also proudly played up - as opposed to down! - the "nerdy" aspects of such games, by...well, play the game and you'll see what I mean.  It's not subtle.  As for whether it's "hilarious" or "cute" or "charming", or simply "grating" or downright "insulting"...well, that's up to the individual.  Scott from Zero Charisma certainly wouldn't approve...in fact, he'd probably put his fist through the computer monitor in rage.  But are we all Scott?  Of course not.  Me personally, I'm probably half-way between sympathising with Scott and thinking the dude should chill out a tad and GET A ♥♥♥♥ING LIFE.  Would he at least be right if he were to complain of a lack of storytelling and character in this "RPG"-styled game?  Of course he would.  Card Hunter is, in essence, just a bunch of semi-tactical battles with a bit of buying and selling and character recruiting in between.  It does, however, lovingly "frame" said battles in D&D-styled "modules", which do go some way towards evoking Ye Olde Memories for soon-to-be nursing-home nominees like yours truly.  If you ever played or bought any old-school D&D paraphernalia, boy, are you gonna have flashbacks!  A lot of the titles of the "adventures" are even puns or variations on famous old D&D modules ("Black Plume Mountain", anyone?), and the art style is also frequently spot-on.\n\nSo is this, ultimately, a loving "tribute" to, or a ♥♥♥♥-take/post-modernist revision of, those old D&D adventures?  Well...it's both, really.  Let me put it this way...you can choose to buy "pizza slices" if the Free-To-Play format gets too sluggish and "grind"-y for your tastes (and you wanna, er, CHEAT, basically).  And there's plenty of other cheeky nods towards gamers and gaming culture itself, as opposed to trying to fully immerse you in a world other than our own.  Actually, the first thing you'll see when you start the game up is a title screen declaring this "The Game Of Fantastical Adventure Limited Only By Your Imagination!"  Which is, of course, a complete and utter crock of ♥♥♥♥♥.  Even the likes of the oldest-school D&D were pushing their luck when they made statements like that.  But I'm pretty confident that the Card Hunter devs KNOW this, and I'm more than happy to nod appreciatively at their constant and well-meant in-referencing.  Having said all that...do I LOVE this game, given that I believe that I understand precisely what it was "meant" to be?\n\nWell..."love" is certainly a strong word.  I certainly like it, quite a lot.  But I've only played a bit over an hour, gotten one measly achievement, and for now I might just put it aside and come back to it when I'm a bit more in the mood (or after I've finished playing Darkest Dungeon, a game more defiantly up my alley).  But it's all up to the individual really, and your own individual sensibilities, and as long as you avoid the lure of the Pay-To-Win incentives, it's a pretty impressive game for the big fat sum of ZERO DOLLARS and ZERO CENTS.  It's fun, has a gob-smackingly beautiful visual aesthetic, inventive sound...there's absolutely no denying that it's a high quality game within the parameters it sets for itself.  But please, please, for the love of the Gods, and this is mostly aimed at all you ♥♥♥♥ing KIDS (under thirty) out there...pretty, pretty PLEASE don't think that this is what a "role-playing game" is.  No video game will EVER replace those, as they're actually about more than just statistics and combat and random number generation.  They really are (at least at their best).  Think of this more as a compromise between, say, super-simplified D&D and Talisman (the board game).  Or failing that, let's just call it a VIDEO GAME with light "strategy" elements and light "RPG" elements, and we can all just stay friends, whad'ya say?\n\nFor now I'm done, but I'm sure I'll return to it in time, when I'm in the mood for a grind-y dungeon hack-er with meticulously "cheesy" aesthetics.  (Hey, come to think of it...maybe the "pizza" symbolism they came up with was pretty apt after all!?)  The game is free, doesn't take up much disc space, and in all honesty you may as well download it and give it a go if you've bothered to even OPEN this Steam Store page.  So why are you sitting there, reading this appallingly long and tiresome review?  Quick, before someone thinks you're a NERD, 'cause you like to READ 'n' ♥♥♥♥...PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!  You don't want people to think you're "smart" or some ♥♥♥♥ like that, do ya?!?\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","July 20, 2015","true","19.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","1"

I started playing this game two years ago, going through the campaign on my own, having a blast customizing my deck to combat the various enemies the game throws at you while laughing at the tongue-in-cheek dialogue. After that, there was a whole other world to explore in competitive multiplayer with other players, with a system that matches the player up with opponents of a roughly equal skill level.\n\nNow with the recent expansion, there's also the possibility to go through the campaign cooperatively with up to two friends, or team up to play a multiplayer match against another team. There's something new to keep you coming back to the game every day, such as special loot rewards for beating certain adventures or 10-hourly leagues which offer completely new scenarios to strategize in.\n\nThe variety of cards is absolutely huge, there's enough possible playstyles to accommodate anyone's tastes, and the constant collecting of new items and cards means you'll often find ways to adjust your characters to be even more to your liking.\n\nCard Hunter is easily the best Free-to-Play game I've ever played with the richest and fullest experience without buying any in-game currency. It's basically as far from a pay-to-win model a Free-to-Play game can be.\n\nAnyone, whether they have a casual or deep interest in the game, whether they prefer playing competitively, cooperatively or solo, whether they buy the in-game currency or not can enjoy this game!","July 13, 2015","true","222.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

That being said, some of the campaign progression is slowed to have to grind for items to equip your characters with.  This is where a minor pay to progress aspect comes in, but again, it is minor.  This is because you can essentially grind past that either by switching over to multiplayer for a handful of games for better item drops, or repeat previous adventures for  gold to buy better items.  There are reports that at higher levels the game slows even more, but I'm only at level 7 currently after about 8 hours of game play. Item prices in the shops are a little steep and just reflects on a pay to progress (more quickly) model.  I wish there was a better tutorial for new players, but it only took me a few games to get the hang of it. The game provides a new element to card game play by providing the boardgame, so it is a nice mesh between card dueling and boardgaming.\n\nThe game has been losing players steadily and is currently only at 25% of its average players online at a given time compared to what it had when it released, only 6 months go, in July 2015. (per steamcharts).  Having that large of a drop over that short of a time should be an indication of the game's longevity.\n\nI would give this game a thumbs up because there is a good number of hours were it will provide enjoyment.  That being said, there is a lot going against it as far as mechanics go.  The random number generator style of card play can be frustrating.  Selling items is a joke as there is no difference in gp value for a level 1 item, or a level 18 item.  Pay to progress models frustrated me because you either have to choose to grind for hours, or pay real money to get the items faster.  It also seems the developers are not interested in keeping players by ignoring any criticisms that have been made.  This game could have been great if the developers balanced game play, improved their mechanics, and didnt require players to grind for advancement.  There are plenty of ways to incentivise purchases but pay to progress, and pay to win for multiplayer, are the least player friendly ways to go about it.","December 16, 2015","false","8.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

But if you do not want to spend money or grind old dungeons over and over for small rewards just to progress at later levels good luck. Higher level dungeons where you are at same item level as the dungeons or slightly below it all comes down to rng which kills the game. Whoever hits their armor rolls will win in battles making the game fustrating when you have to either grind to get over geared and over leveled to pass. Or spend money just so you do not have to keep praying to the RNG gods that the enemies always hit their armor roles and you never hit your armor roles. It truely kills a great game when it comes down to RNG later in the game if you are going the free to play route.","January 10","false","34.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

If you get stuck, visit the shop and buy some cheap common cards/gear and change your strategy. Certain cards work better than others on different maps. I played through the campaign without needing to grind. After that you will unlock quests which are more challenging. You can pay to unlock additional maps but it not necessary to experience the game.\n\nPlenty of multiplayer options including ranked matches, co-op and league matches. If you are stuck ask someone to help you out. IF you have poor cards then play a league match with fixed deck.

Also the fact that the game rolls the dice for you.\n\nWhen I first looked at it in the steam store, I didn't really think that this game (especially that it's free) would give me hours of great fun with friends. Boy was I wrong. After 8 hours of playing with friends and talking to them over teamspeak, we still haven't discovered 1/8 of the map! (it's huge!) There are lots of dungeons and items, ranging from wands or spears to lasers and mines!\n\nThere is a premium currency in the game called "pizza slices" for which you can get various skins for your characters, weeks of premium (gives you additional loot after every level in a dungeon) or you can buy chests with epic items! At the beginning they give you around $5 worth of the currency, which is enough to open some best chests available for your level and/or buy a skin / week of premium. It's very generous from the developers.\n\nOnce I launched the game, the tutorial was pretty long, and you had to finish it in order to play co-op or multiplayer. After finishing it, me and my friends chose our characters for co-op and went for an adventure. Another thing missing here is you can't see your friends on the map. It only tells you in the chat where they have moved, and when the team wants to go to a dungeon, the team leader must go there first and press "Battle!". That will invite everyone from the party. It got me confused at first.\n\nAfter that, we really got into the game, we did a 8 hour long session and leveled up our characters to level 7. Then I played some multiplayer, and that is PvP battles on various maps, kind of King of the Hill style.\n\nTime for some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- Huge map\n- Not pay2win\n- Lots of different equipment and animations.\n- Multiplayer / Co-op\n- Lots of joy\n- Many, many dungeons\n- A story\n- Brings back the memories\n\nCons:\n\n- Only 3 player co-op\n- The game rolls the dice for you (this one is a personal con)\n- Can't see friends on map when playing co-op\n- Kind of long tutorial\n- No randomness in story (the dices thrown by the "GM" (AI) are fixed, unfortunately)\n- Can't create your own character, no stats (like agility etc.)\n\nI can easily recommend this game, especially that it's free, and gives hours of joy and nostalgia.

Are your weekly Pathfinder games not enough for you? Are you having trouble finding a party of adventures to dungeon crawl with you? Look no further cause Card Hunter brings challenging AI and tactical thinking that will keep you entertained for hours, and it's all free to boot.\n\ncreate a party of three of your choice from from the following races and classes:\nRaces: Dwarve, Human, Elf\nClasses: Warrior, Mage, Priest\nWhy not level each type that's a combo of 165 parties have at it!\n\nLoot is well set up each class gets specific gear the only ones that are in common are the Shield (which both the warrior and priest get) and Boots (whichs everyone gets) not to mention each class and race get special skill slot. The awesome part is gear is how you get your cards. You don't pick and choose cards individually like a deck builder, but you find loot which have 3 cards attached them them; unless they are weapons which have six cards. The play style for each class is tremindous I can't say on play style is better then the other but there is deffinitely synergy to make a character awesome. Personally I'm thinking of making a life steal dwarven priest, a dwarven mage that plays keep away with a card that causes them to take damage whenever they move and a elven warrior that is hasty to get in close and deal some heavy damage. What type of class you play may fall to lady luck depending on the items your able to find.\n\nI have yet to touch multiplayer I want to finish the single player first before I try it out, but single player and multiplayer is linked so that you use the same character and gear and levels are locked when you switch to multiplayer to create an even playing field.\n\nLong story short if your a fan of table top RPG adventures this is the game for you.","July 21, 2015","true","24.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You are playing a tabletop role-playing game with a Game Master, and you control your minifigures and defeat enemy encounters by using skill cards. Anyway, lets just go on ahead to the pros and cons...\n\nPros-\n\nThe Concept itself is very cool, I being a Game Master myself. Thank you developers for making a game where the Game Master is actually somewhat relevant :-)\n\nGraphically it is good, if you like these cheesy kinda graphics. It just makes it more unique in my opinion.\n\nLots of room for development. The developers will likely add a ton of content over time, which is really cool. Plus you can easily change whatever you want material wise. Want Legend Of Zelda themed pieces? Just change out some of the files and you have it!\n\nCons-\n\nCombat, the combat itself is basic, and to similar to basically any other turn/card based games.\n\nCostly, the extra content costs quite a bit, but I think the developers have earned it to some degree. Pay-To-Win elements when it comes to the multiplayer aspect of the game.\n\nConclusion-\nOverall I find this game to be fun. There are some aspects of it that I believe could be changed, but this is a solid game as is and I recommend it. Bring your tabletop roleplaying to the PC using Card Hunter!\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League","July 21, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The fiction is best thought of as a cute gift wrapper for the game design, but honestly - it doesn't need more.\n\nFinally, it just feels *patient*. You can feel like  you've made progress with only 20 minutes at a time, if you like, or binge for hours. A couple of years ago, as a new father with free time at weird hours, Card Hunter was a kind of refuge of clarity and safety-within-risk. But that was just MY reason to fall in love with it.

Also the fact that the game rolls the dice for you.\n\nWhen I first looked at it in the steam store, I didn't really think that this game (especially that it's free) would give me hours of great fun with friends. Boy was I wrong. After 8 hours of playing with friends and talking to them over teamspeak, we still haven't discovered 1/8 of the map! (it's huge!) There are lots of dungeons and items, ranging from wands or spears to lasers and mines!\n\nThere is a premium currency in the game called "pizza slices" for which you can get various skins for your characters, weeks of premium (gives you additional loot after every level in a dungeon) or you can buy chests with epic items! At the beginning they give you around $5 worth of the currency, which is enough to open some best chests available for your level and/or buy a skin / week of premium. It's very generous from the developers.\n\nOnce I launched the game, the tutorial was pretty long, and you had to finish it in order to play co-op or multiplayer. After finishing it, me and my friends chose our characters for co-op and went for an adventure. Another thing missing here is you can't see your friends on the map. It only tells you in the chat where they have moved, and when the team wants to go to a dungeon, the team leader must go there first and press "Battle!". That will invite everyone from the party. It got me confused at first.\n\nAfter that, we really got into the game, we did a 8 hour long session and leveled up our characters to level 7. Then I played some multiplayer, and that is PvP battles on various maps, kind of King of the Hill style.\n\nTime for some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- Huge map\n- Not pay2win\n- Lots of different equipment and animations.\n- Multiplayer / Co-op\n- Lots of joy\n- Many, many dungeons\n- A story\n- Brings back the memories\n\nCons:\n\n- Only 3 player co-op\n- The game rolls the dice for you (this one is a personal con)\n- Can't see friends on map when playing co-op\n- Kind of long tutorial\n- No randomness in story (the dices thrown by the "GM" (AI) are fixed, unfortunately)\n- Can't create your own character, no stats (like agility etc.)\n\nI can easily recommend this game, especially that it's free, and gives hours of joy and nostalgia.

With other games, you are given your cards, play a few games and then leave the game due to a dwindling interest.

At the start of each encounter, your party of characters and their enemies are deployed on the board, and each of them is given a hand of cards from their deck. The player and the Game Master alternate playing a card from their hands to move across the board, execute a melee attack, or cast spells. When both of them pass without playing any card, the turn ends. If there are any hands with more than two cards, these must be discarded down to two, and two new cards are drawn from their respective decks to form a new set of hands. Play continues until the player or the Game Master attains their victory condition.\n\nThere is no perma-death in this game, so even if your entire party gets killed, you can always start over with the same party if you want to.\n\nMy Evaluation\nUsing cards instead of dice to resolve actions is nothing short of brilliant. This game mechanic adds a level of planning that would not be possible with dice alone. If you enjoy turn-based tactical combat in a D&D-like setting, Card Hunter may be for you. This game doesn't come with an emotionally engaging story (not that you should expect one), but you may appreciate the geek humor that this game has in spades.\n\nNote that Card Hunter has microtransactions, but they really aren't necessary to win. Over all, I find the developer's business model to be fair and well worth supporting.","July 20, 2015","true","48.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then it takes four clicks to get back into the fight after getting the shaft from the random number god. It takes even more to bail out on an adventure sequence in progress. (You have to forfeit up to three times in a row to exhaust your continues).\n\nAn example of bad RNG and balancing: Monsters almost always come in groups. This means they get to share a hand. That means any monster in the group can use all the attacks. But wait! It gets worse: every creature in the group gets to use all of the block and armor cards.

I'm pretty sure the computer cheats to make unrevealed cards in the computers hand exactly what they need if the computer is losing. And you're guaranteed to draw at least one move card, but not attack/heal/magic for your three classes, so you frequently find yourself inundated with move cards.

It is super addicting but easy to pick up and put down as needed. It is also enjoyable to play on your own or with another friend or two. There are times where it is difficult to commit to campaigns and this really quells that craving to just build a character, step out into a fantasy world, and kick some serious butt.\n\nThe experience and loot gained is satisfying; sometimes you may get a piece of bacon for a resale value of two gold but sometimes it is a really awesome weapon with abilities that make your deck shine. There is a lot of strategy involved and this game provides a nice challenge. As a free player there are plenty of encounters to enjoy but I have to admit that I am looking forward to purchasing some adventure packs in the future.\n\nThe free model is excellent on it's own, but for those who like to invest a little and enhance their experience, it looks like Card Hunter has you covered there as well.\n\nI am definitely getting my friends to play this.","January 8","true","20.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Even purchasing the 20 dollar (ON SALE!!) premium "basic edition" pack only gets you one month of their, frankly revolting, subscription based grind aid. Needless to say the multiplayer element is essentially pointless in any numbers game with a cash shop, so there's that as well.\n\nUltimately, the gameplay is pretty solid. I would definitely recommend giving the single player a whirl for a bit if you feel interested. Just do not spend a single red cent on anything in the game if you have any respect for yourself or video games in general. It is truly a shame they didn't just release this game on a buy to play basis for steam, or at least let you permanently upgrade to a "bought edition" instead of keeping the micro-trans, and the ludicrous subscription-to-a-browser-game concept, firmly in place.","July 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","20","41","0","0"

You have a table, game master, plain paper battle map, different papers with stats, story and all other info; dices, decks, characters in form of plain cardboard tokens, and sounds that fit tabletop atmosphere perfectly. I mean the style is 11/10. It received "PC Gamer: Most Original Game of the Year 2013" award - I guess that was the main reason, because... gameplay is pretty boring as for me.\nEvery battle you control 3 characters: Warrior, Mage and Cleric. Each character has his own deck, and item slots. Each equipped item adds its cards to that character deck. Yes they don't give any stats, there are actually no stats at all (but hp) and no auto-attacks. Character levels increase amount of item slots and hp.\nSo, for example your Warrior deck has 40 cards. His Rare Sword gives him 6 cards, including 1 Rare Smash, 2 Uncommon Punches and 3 Common Strikes. Uncommon Boots give him 1 Uncommon Run, 1 Common Walk and 1 Common Weak Armor. Common Shield gives him 2 Common Blocks and 1 Common Armor. And so on.\nEach round all characters draw 3 cards from their decks, with only exception that at least 1 card will always be Move card. So yes, there will be situations when your Warrior has drawn all Armor cards and won't be able to attack till next round at best. Each turn player chooses 1 card of 1 character and plays it. When all players passed the turn, all characters choose 2 cards and discard the rest, and next round begins.\nJust like in any CCG, there are a lot of nuances like line of sight, direction the unit is facing, terrain types, armor and penetration mechanics based on dice rolls, buffs/debuffs, trait cards that have to be played at yourself at the beginning of round, terrain enchantments, knockbacks, damage types (crushing, piercing, lightning, arcane, etc.) and... well I don't know them all because I only played few hours :O\nCampaign seems to be pretty huge - the map is, at least, and I only discovered several missions - a tiny part of it. Each mission has few battles on different terrain with different monsters and a (simple) story. And the loot, of course - you get new equipment and/or "treasure" items which are only good to sell. Go to the shop between missions, sell them and buy something you actually need. You can change equipment between battles and before the next try, if you lost. You only have 3 tries and then you have to restart mission.\nSurprisingly, goals don't always end up being "kill everything", some are interesting. There are also Treasure Hunts, which are only unlocked with premium currency which is Pizza Slices :p\nMultiplayer should be fun as well, but I didn't try it since you have to level up your characters and get some cards in campaign first to get there, and I did not ;p There are dailies also, as far as I know.\nMicrotransactions are used for levels, cosmetics and items. I can't say for sure, since I didn't play much but the game doesn't look like P2W. Steam reviews also say it's not. With premium you get 1 extra loot item each battle, some hidden levels, you can buy more things in shop and therefore probably collect Rare cards faster. But just like in GOOD CCGs, luck with drops and patience decides much more.\nSo why my verdict here is No, and why is it No without doubts? 2 things.\nFirst, I don't like how Cards are drawn. I don't know if it's the style or just lack of talent, but this is just TOO simple. Check screenshots. I mean I could draw such art, too, and these are not empty words. I understand this isn't MTG with its several dozens professional artists, most of which dedicated whole life drawing fantasy. But come on, this is CCG after all. There is no way I am collecting cards that look like 10y.o drawing. Characters, monsters, terrain, illustrations - everything else looks fine.\nAnd second - as for me, gameplay is boring - maybe original, but boring. There is no excitement when you do smart tactical decisions and win, which I have in Hearthstone or MTG.\nP.S. Don't forget - there are ABSOLUTELY no animations in game, except poorly made spell effects. Since it is Tabletop-styled. You don't have much animations when you play board games, do you? Facial expressions don't count ^^\nClass: III - Bread\nVerdict: No\nReviewed: 8.24.2015\nApproach: Steam - PC\nTime: Several Hours\nDeeds:\n1 Achievement","August 24, 2015","false","6.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","0"

Who knows..', Cuddlepie thought.\nIt felt like days ago when he and his friends last saw the sky. They had been crushing and slashing their way through zombies and skeletons for too long, way too long. Mr Jingles had already fallen... Wouldn't be long before fatigue got the best of him also.\n'Damn our luck..', he mumbled. Their cart crashed probably at the worst place ever. He just knew that cottage was bad news. He could feel it, and his fears proved correct when the dead appeared and never stopped coming. They had hoped it would be just a few, easy to get rid of. But that was just wishful thinking.\n\nBoppsy made a tough decision, but it was the right one. Perhaps someone else would have ignored the sinister laughs and the cries for help from the cottage and just run away. But not them. It was obvious that whatever evil lurked inside the cottage had to be dealt with, once and for all.\n'By me beard, young lady, FOCUS!'. His thoughts were interrupted by Boppsy's fierce voice.\n'I am trying, you silly dwarf! I already put that giant skeleton in the other cell, do you think teleporting others is as easy as swinging a hammer?' The wizard replied\n'Perhaps you 'd like to do it then!', Boppsy laughed back, while breaking another skeleton in pieces. 'Cuddlepie, are you ready?'\n'Always, brother', I replied.\n\nWe had finally reached the last chamber of the cottage and I was staring at the evil necromancer for some time now, only few meters ahead of me, yet so far away. The lava between us was impassable. I was exhausted but I was also ready to strike with my most powerful combo. Boppsy was right behind me, succesfully holding off the endless waves of the necromancer's minions at the narrow corridor between the two jail cells. The young, imprisoned wizard was in one of the cells, trying her best to help Boppsy and teleport me next to the necromancer for the fatal blow.\nThe necromancer was mocking us, throwing spells without caring if we die now or later...\n\n'Finally!!!', I heard a faint yell. And time stopped\nI tried my best to hold my senses. I had prepared my all out attack and now I also had the perfect block ready. My vision blurred and a split second later I was next to the evil necromancer. He didn't seem worried nor afraid I was next to him and he lifted his weapon to crush me down...\nNo, I wasn't expecting that. In my surprise I desperately threw my shield up while dashing on the right. It blocked his swing and he lost his balance, and he wasn't ready at all for my reckless swing that hacked him from shoulder to bottom.\n\nThe chaos had stopped.\n\nRNG, as much as I f#!@&% hate you, Card Hunter has also taught me to love you.","December 4, 2015","true","143.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyknight/recommended/293260/","greyknight","Commissar Blam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyknight/","75 products in account","Card Hunter is a deeply enjoyable game. It's a fusion of traditional Dungeons & Dragons tabletop and Magic: the Gathering style card game presented in a charming aesthetic that mimics classic D&D boards. The mechanics, while odd at first are quick to learn and work very well. There's a full suite of some 30 multi-mission adventures on offer, along with fleshed-out PvP that's accessible basically right off the bat in a competitive state.\n\nOh, and all of this is free. Not bad, right?\n\nBUT - and this is a very big BUT - the amount of RNG involved in the gameplay is absolutely through the roof. Each character you control draws every move (up to and including actual moving) from an unseen, randomly shuffled deck of cards. The only guaranteed draw is the basic movement card which is always given to you at the start of each round. Absolutely everything else from attacks to healing spells to self debuff cards is completely random.\n\nIt is maddening and sadly all too common for my fighter (big chap who hits things with a sword/club/lightsaber) to go several rounds in a row without drawing a single attack card, and then draw a single kind of crap one before going another round without. For a class that's supposed to be up close and personal at all times this is downright deadly, especially since in the campaign adventures monsters seem to have an incredibly strong chance of drawing their most potent attack more or less every turn. This also applies to the priest (healing and buff/debuff support) and mage (killing things from far away), who are also both often caught without anything useful in their hands in the heat of the action.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Card Hunter *is* a good game. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives by a fair margin. But I cannot stress enough that it can sometimes be an incredibly frustrating experience because so much of it is left down to the whims of RNJesus. The only thing you have complete control over is the positioning of your characters. Play it, but be very aware of that fact because it WILL bite you in the ♥♥♥♥ with alarming frequency.","January 17","true","41.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It has SP and MP modes, co-op, daily rewards, and a map editor. The big thing that makes it unique is the fact that you don't own individual cards; instead you're collecting items that contain 3 or 6 cards each. Each of your chars has their own deck created by the items they have equipped (36 cards once all equipment slots are unlocked) which they draw from during battles.\n\nCombat involves moving your chars around on a 2D map (handmade, every SP map is unique) made up of several terrain types, but their actions are limited to the cards in their hands. Attacks can have ranges, area of effect, damage over time, buffs, debuffs, or even create special terrain types. Victory is based not just on what cards you have but also your skill in positioning and timing (the order you play your cards or pass).\n\nIt truly is free-to-play. Every card, item, race, and class is available for free. The only premium content are special character skins (purely decorative) and certain SP modules that give a specific item when you first complete them. But those items aren't the rarest or best in the game, and can be obtained from random drops and shops in both modes. The other main use of premium currency is Club Membership which gives an extra item every time you win a battle while a member. You can also use the premium currency to buy chests (booster packs) or convert to common curency for the shops, but those are considered to be wastes of money. There is no trading or direct purchasing of specific items you want, you have to wait for it to show up in a chest or shop.\n\nWhy do I love this game so much? Why have I played it every day for over two years?\n\n1. Free. Singleplayer. Turnbased.\nYou just can't find many games that fit all three conditions.\n\n2. Nice clear interface.\nBen Lee's artwork is beautifully clear and distinctive, making it easy to tell my chars apart. The boards are flat so my chars are never obscured by walls. Lots of useful information when you hover the mouse over things. Ability to mute the music and ambient sounds (they're not bad, I just don't like them in my games).\n\n3. SP doesn't force you to play against humans.\nIt's a huge campaign of 73 modules (5 tutorial, 38 regular, 9 fan-made, 21 premium) most containing 3 battles and you can play every single one of them without ever facing a human opponent.\n\n(If you'd rather play against humans, at about level 5 you'll be invited to MP and given a free premade party to get you started. Then you'll have to play one more game against the AI to introduce MP rules (timers, draw limits) but after that you can disable AI opponents and play only humans from then on.)","July 13, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And i have to say this game is even more fun in coop.\n\nYou really have to plan the moves together and build your party accordingly to the enemies to defeat some of the harder levels. I also love that there is such a variety of factors deciding the match. Just equipping the strongest items wont get you far. Since it is a deckbuilding game there obviously is a element of chance in the fights, but i you can compensate that pretty good by choosing the right equipments.\n\nAs for the buisness model, i have to say this is an extremely fair free to play title. You can play this game completely without paying a dime. Paying will just give you a little more loot, different looks for your heroes and access to bonus levels. So you should consider buying this as a thank you to the developers, for letting you play such a great game.","July 23, 2015","true","88.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Not only is it addicting in its simplicity, it's also one of those rare free games that doesn't hit you with a paywall (that I've seen in the total time I've played.)\n\nBrief summary: you play against a Game Master (AI) and choose between three classes, and three races (not a huge selection, but they are varied enough that it makes a difference.) Then, you select modules to play, defeat the mobs, and gain loot/exp, which allows you to buy better equipment. The only twist is, it's a card based game, so each piece of equipment (or lack thereof) corresponds with a set of cards that will be added to your character's deck.\n\nIf you like time killing, and a bit of a challenge, there's honestly no reason to NOT pick this up, as you'll get countless hours playing it at no cost (though I'm going to toss a few $$$ the devs way anyhow, as I appreciate them not using the Canadian Devil's Freemium strategies.)

Being an RPG fan myself, I can't say that this system does much for the deck-building fans out there, however.\n\nOver all, it's a fun romp and worth a couple hours of your time, if just to check out the systems in play.

These guys must REALLY love playing instead of making money.\n- The graphic style is awesome.\n- The playability is - a very little bit monotone but - really easy compared to some otther boardgames in real and on PC.\n- At least for me it has just the right little ammount of Text for a PC-"RPG". Even some funny little outgame-events are not missing.\n- There is sh!tloads of stuff to collect and to build up you chars: optical and gearwise.\n- Unlike in most of modern free 2 play games, I dont feel forced to spend any money for "additional stuff" at all (especially this fact could even cause me to do so or to donate).\n...\n\nThis game is awesome for everybody who loves real boardbased RPG but hasn't enough time or a playgroup in real. Its exactly how I imagined a PC-version of a board-RPG has to be.\n\nI bow my knee for you, my Heroes!

If you hate it? Well we will probably agree, it's not a fun game because of it.\n\nThen there is the proof of "Free to pay" game it is where it offers you special games and extra loot if you pay for a premium currency, however it's based in IRL time and it doesn't matter if you sunk 500 dollars on it earlier, if you just ran out you will be left without anything in the future.

For starters there's nothing inherently wrong with this game at first glance, it looks nice, plays well, decent gameplay, leveling system etc etc, I was all set to love this game appart from one massive game breaking (in my case) oversight, no resolution options ingame or pre-load, this lead to everything being "slightly to the right" of where my cursor actually was and by slightly I mean a good centimetre or two and yeah I could of grinned and bared it but frankly it ruined the game for me then and there, I slugged through the first level, tried to sort the resolution issue and then came here to write this review.

You move your characters around a dungeon game-board, and attack enemies, using cards drawn from the deck of cards each of your characters has. The most unique twist Card Hunter has on this genre is that your decks aren't built simply by placing whichever cards you want into your decks, but by equipping your characters with items, each of which brings several cards to the table. This means you have to weigh the advantages of the stronger cards on items against the disadvantages of their weaker cards.  It starts simple but very quickly will require you to tailor your decks to face specific challenges - such as trying to maximise the number of longer range attacks you bring when facing enemies that like to dance out of range of short range melee attacks.\n\nThe free to play model has often been called *too* fair; you can get a remarkable amount of game without ever spending a cent. It isn't pay-to-win, and there's no difficulty-paywall to make you feel that you can't progress without paying; tailoring your decks and strategies will see you through all the challenges that seem too hard at first, rather than forking out for subscriber advantages. To be frank, most people who end up subscribing do so as much because the developers have earned it as much as to access subscriber priveleges.\n\nThere are several multiplayer modes, and the primary one is deep, complex, challenging and immensely satisfying. I've played a hell of a lot of Hearthstone and Scrolls, and my wins in Card Hunter are far more exciting and satisfying than in either of those games. Other multiplayer modes (primarily Leagues) vary from more casual and random to differently challenging games using the same core systems, and they're a lot of fun too. The community is, by the standards of such games, excellent. You'll rarely have trouble getting help and tips, and it's very rare that people don't win or lose with good grace.\n\nAll in all, if you like strategic turn-based games, and/or CCGs, and/or tabletop games, or if you're just curious about any of these things, you owe it to yourself to try Card Hunter out. I think it's probably the best free game I've ever played.\n\nOh, a sidenote about the latest expansion which launched simultaneously with the game's release on Steam: I already loved this game a lot, but hell, these are the best, funniest, coolest campaign maps in the game! The nods to System Shock 2 seem cool until you realise that some of the devs *worked* on SS2, then the nods become mindblowing.

I think what surprised me most about it was just how polished it feels. The UI is very smooth, the combat log clears up any confusions about what happens, and the occasional nerdy banter and tabletop feel adds a lot of humor to the game. The gameplay itself is also fun, it definitely doesn't feel like a ripoff of MTG or other card games.","July 14, 2015","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some items will provide a good mix of AOE cards, some items will provide direct damage, most items will be an unholy and utterly useless mishmash  with junk cards that you won't want in any situation and one card that you really want but probably will never draw because it comes buffered with garbage.\n\nAround level 10 you start getting encounters that you absolutely have to base your party gear (deck) around, and loot is pretty sparse. I liked the game enough to pay for a starter back wich gave me extra loot drop for most of my playtime, and am currently stuck in a quest that requires crowd control but I still never managed to find any good crowd control items (no up to level fire staves or axe based multi target attacks,) the few items I have will have 2 of the attack I want and 4 junk cards that I'll be more likely to draw.\n\nDespite that, the cash shop isn't strictly predatory, between level requirements on items and the fact that said items are fairly cheap to buy (it's just extremely hard to find something you want at the merchants,) but there will be wasted days where you'll grind lower level dungeons until merchant inventory resets, and there will be be a wall where each new mission takes 2-3 days of grinding before you beat it.","July 23, 2015","true","54.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You are forced into 30-50+ retries just because it was literally impossible with the cards you were given. Like you have 4 turns to kill an enemy and you are given no weapon cards, just block and move.\n\nAs the special campaign levels are visible on the campaign map like every other level, I really want to complete them - but it's seriously idiotic how they are 98% RNG-dependent.\n\nBuying all the DLC is $45.\n\nMultiplayer I haven't tried.","July 17, 2015","false","34.5"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","14","30","2","2"

As you advance the game pits you against increasingly stacked odds. The problem is your cards are all drawn random, so if you do not get just the right draw combination on many maps there is no recovery and you have to start over. Not that random cards are totally bad, it is just that your opponent does not seem to follow the same rule. Your cards are random but the computer seems to have attack cards, move cards and defense every turn. Random cards for the PC would have balanced play but it does not appear to be designed that way.\n\nSome may like this style but to me anyway this totally negates strategy in the game, it comes down to random card draws and luck. If you find frustration and yelling at the computer when you need an attack card and get all move cards, die and have to start over, this is the game for you. Me personally it is being uninstalled.\n\nNice idea to mirror an old table top game, but poor implementation.","August 21, 2015","false","21.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The last thing i want to add is this games  f2p model is good, it's not p2w.","July 13, 2015","true","25.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It is a fusion of D&D and deckbuilding.  Every piece of loot you collect adds specific cards to each of your party members' decks.  You draw cards each turn and try to make the most out of your spells, melee attacks, heals, and movements.  Dice rolls are made with many of the blocking cards so there is an element of chance.  Other than that, the rest of battle is affected by how you build your decks.  This game is free so it's definately worth a try.  You can pay actual money to gain access to more loot, campaigns, and cosmetics.  If you like turn-based combat and/or deckbuilding, you'll love Card Hunter.","July 14, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You can spent money to get random loots faster, buy certain premium quest modules, and cosmetic figure outfits.\n\nFrom my prospective, one of the best part about this game is the fact that each game could be done in 10-20 minutes or less and there's no problem with taking a break.  So it's a really good game for people who are busy and can't spent more than 30 - 40 minutes at a time.\n\nAll in all, this game has kept me entertained for a long time now, and I look forward to additional contents from the developer to keep this game growing.\n","July 13, 2015","true","317.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Otherwise why call this a role-playing game since there is no roleplaying? Gaining levels is not a roleplaying game that's a level-up game.\n\nThird, combat is simple, somewhat fun and does not take forever to go through one fight. I don't like the card system for armour, it's dumb, you are either wearing your armour or not, it should not depend on your cards, it's silly. Skills on the other hand should, even though I find that silly too but it's a card game. Permanent items like armour and shields should always be in effect and not count as a card. There are some challenging fights out there too.\n\nFourth, microtransactions, yay! I'd rather buy the game that being faced with begging Devs, because that's how I see game devs that puts micro trans in their game, beggars. You can go far in the game without using any mt.\n\nFifth, having an adventure where you explore an area would be great. It wouldn't be just hack'n'slash turn-based.\n\nI recommend barely this game, I think the dev / pub should sell this game and remove all micro trans from it. The mts are really not worth any real money. I won't waste money to make one, and only one of my character look different. Why the hell would I want to pay for that?\n\nIf you don't like micro-transactions, stay away from this game.

However there are two major issues that really limit it. First off the leveling system they have in place doesn't let you replay any previous dungeons if they are a couple levels below you. If you try your level will be drastically reduced, you won't get any experience whatsoever, and because of your artificially reduced level you will also now be too low level to use your own gear! So apparently you are expected to constantly lug around tons of worthless low level gear for your party just in case you want to play any scenario deemed below you (which is generally like 90 percent of them) and you will also get nothing whatsoever out of it. FUN!\n\nSecond it's very micro transaction heavy. There are a very large number of skins, and now scenarios (including the new Penny Arcade ones) that you simply CANNOT play unless you pay. This is not an issue of paying to advance more quickly, this is literally walling off part of the game forever unless you pay up.\n\nI'd much rather just pay once for a full priced game than this nickel and dime b.s.\n\nAvoid until/if they ever figure out a better pay structure","April 24","false","6.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game on its face is fun, but the combat relies HEAVILY on random dice rolls. A string of bad rolls WILL mean that you fail a mission, no matter how skilled you are or how well you've built your characters. Add to that the enemies seeming to get very powerful cards just a little ways into the game (rank 7 missions, and even earlier) and it can get immensely frustrating incredibly quickly. It may be that enemies have smaller decks than the player characters do, which means key cards (armor, powerful attacks, etc) come up more than they do for the player, or it may just be my poor luck, but at the end of the day, when no amount of strategy can win in the face of a string of bad luck, I can't recommend this game. In my opinion, a certain degree of luck in games is fine, but when the ability to even make an attack comes down to luck of the draw, I think that hurts the game. It's not a bad game by any means when the other components are taken into consideration (art is good, the tone of the game is humorous, and the mechanics for character progression and deck building are fun) but it is very frustrating when battles are won or lost based almost purely on RNGs.","August 9, 2015","false","5.4"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","7","17","2","3"

The game mechanics are interesting and fun but it is pay-to-not having to grind and you are playing an RPG without story or immersion or atmosphere.\n\nIt is such a shame that a really great idea for mechanics is wasted because of greediness (asking money for content and loot) and laziness (no story, animations, atmosphere).\n\nPROs:\n- Game mechanics are unique and interesting. It is basically a puzzle game (which gear to equip for which battle) meet tactical combat a la XCOM.\n- The whole "meta" aspect - you play someone who is playing a game - is funny (for about 15 minutes).\n\nCONs:\n- The devs ask you every 5 seconds for real money. Big portions of the game are only available when paying for it. Image that in The Witcher you are being asked to pay 4 Euros to enter this dungeoun. The game really is all about loot (cards). Every single action a character can perform - even to walk - comes from cards which come from equipment. Loot is everything, levels are nothing. Now, you can grind your way to victory over countless hours or simply pay cash to get loot. At the same time, the  price per month is about the same as for a triple A MMORPG, WTH?\n- Multiplayer is very asymmetrical, players do not get even chances because single player loot is used.","December 20, 2015","false","11.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The futuristic direction made previous cards useless. The RWG on loot and during play gets old. The random generation generally doesn't give you enough rare cards in relation to how many times you have to win against players who simply bought their decks. There is rampant cheating and people taking advantage of leaderboard mechanics. Cheaters can see your cards and magically have a counter. People take advantage of the leaderboards by intentionally trashing their own rank in order to get "consecutive wins".\n\nThe mechanics of how cards work is also confusing. Combinations are difficult to create unless you spend the time to understand the mechanics of a card rather than what it actually says.\n\nIt was fun for a while but, it's not sustainable gameplay.","April 26","false","116.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

Other reviewers have covered those well enough.\n\nI gave it a fair shake with over a dozen hours of play this week so I'm here to tell you that playing this game beyond the first impression is awful.  The table-top theme becomes very burdensome, limiting the maps to roughly 1/3-1/2 of a 16:9 monitor.  The fancy dice or whatever that you see in the screenshots are useless borders.\n\nThe "DM" is a series of running jokes about pizza, pimples, living in Mom's basement, etc.  They provide ZERO atmosphere to the game but constantly interrupt the flow of your party's grind as you have to acknowledge each inane comment to continue playing.\n\nIn addition to being tiny, the maps are exceedingly boring combinations of terrain squares.  The art is so bad that you have to examine each tile to get an understanding of the intended impact on movement or line of sight and good luck remember them all.  Once you've decided how your party will be built, you'll play every map exactly the same way.\n\nMultiplayer is immediately accessible since your multiplayer team is max level.  You still have to grind for equipment, however, although I see that you can purchase ready-made and equipped teams for multiplayer games.  One team is provided, armed and ready, for free.  Multiplayer, however, is exactly the same as playing generic campaign boards only with (sometimes) superior intelligence.  I enjoyed the handful of games I played, then watched a couple of more games, and never felt the need to try it again.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to love it but recommend giving this one a pass.\n","July 17, 2015","false","13.8"," 20 of 45 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","20","45","0","0"

Honestly this game combines the faults of card games (no heart of the card here), D&D elements with horrible mechanics (enemies move in groups, enemies have high damge cards while you do not, my bad they have a lot while you have little, dice rolls that seem rigged, hints/tips that are redundant because of the mechanics of needing power gems for "everything".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rdadolf/recommended/293260/","rdadolf","Borogove","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rdadolf/","159 products in account","There are good free-to-play games (e.g.- Dota2, Path of Exile) and bad ones (e.g.- anything by Zynga). Unfortunately, this falls squarely into the latter category.\n\nIt's a clever concept, no doubt. And despite some trashy pitfalls (your "GM" is an utter unlikable fellow, and I'm sick of his voice already), the fundamentals like combat mechanics, pacing, and interface are decent. But it's the F2P "features" that weasel their way into the game that really suck the fun out of it.\n\nFirst, the big one: you can't repeat quests more than once per day. This is what really turns me off. Once you've run what's on the map, you're done. Go play something else. This is a direct result of their F2P model: it artificially limits your characters, and paying "Pizza" (their in-game currency) allows you to bypass this somewhat.\n\nSecond, despite what others have said, there *are* pay-to-win features here. It's not all cosmetic.\n\nThird, they shove it in your face. There's a "membership club" (read: pay us for more items), which awards more loot at the end of dungeons. Regardless of whether you've signed up or not, they roll an item reward and lock it if you're not a member.\n\nI get it. Casual gaming is a tough market, and getting free-to-play right is hard. Too much and your game looks like a trashy ebay ad; too little and you don't get a paycheck. That said, they didn't even come close to the right balance here.\n\nI'll pass, thanks.","July 26, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JesterKyu/recommended/293260/","JesterKyu","Saika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JesterKyu/","97 products in account","Alright, as you can see I've put 90 hours or more into this game in just two weeks. Admittedly, some of that was me leaving the game on. But I digress.\n\nAs others have said, this game starts off as fun, but challenging. Around the level 6-7 area is where the game actually begins to get more fun and challenging at the same time. it is a very fun and satisfying experience when you overcome a very stacked battle against your adventurers, but soon the tedium sets in and you start to see the unfair difficulty in spades. Soon you realize just how stacked odds are against you when you actually play and count the number of random dice rolls and the like in a fight and how the game *Perhaps* manipulates the battles and cards as you play.\n\nExample : You and your party are up against armor shredding enemies who have 2 space attack cards that go through armor and 1 space attack cards that discard all your armor cards. These enemies only pull 13-16 cards at the beginning of the match and they are for the most part 90% good cards. Enemies have "Failure" cards such as discarding all blocks, or discarding all attacks, which can mean you'll have an easier time for that round and perhaps the next. The problem is, that they usually have cards better than yours, and the game knocks you down levels so you can't come back with great gear.\n\nSo you decide to run a party mix of warrior, priest, and mage. Positioning is VERY important in this game. You sometimes need to play "Hold back" or "Aggressive" in order to win. Look at the board, notice line of sight, basic strategem. Understood, right? Thing is, if you make "one" mistake, a party member is dead because it is usually 5+ VS 3...or in some cases 13-14 against 3. Albeit some mobs of enemies come as one...so its 3 goblins as "1" enemy who shares cards and usually have little hp.\n\nSo you begin the fight, and you get your hand of cards. You stacked your priest for heals, you stacked your mage for long-range damage, and you stack your warrior for tanking/medium strikes. Your mage sees a mob in range, she/he casts a spell. The enemy mob has at least 2 block cards and 1 missile reflect on turn one. These cards have rolls of 3-4 to deflect, so thats a 50%-60% chance they will fail....but you have to roll all three times. After 90 hours of play, I know that these rolls are indeed not as random as they officially appear. And sometimes you want one to be blocked, but instead a lower chanced one will activate.\n\nI have recorded how many times my mages spells have been "Reflected" instead of "Blocked" by cards with far higher  chances. My spell will go under the missile block and be reflected...followed by a block. Now you may be saying "Just go melee it, then?" right? So I change the strategy, use my warrior....If I use all my movement to get my healer and warrior into position, my warrior backstabbing (Like a rogue) to bypass blocks and my healer being able to heal....the 2+ enemies who are stacked against you will indeed backstab your warrior in return usually wounding him/her down to 5-9 hp...or worse, killing them outright.\n\nThe thing is, each round the game gives you a certain amount of cards from your "Deck" but I've noticed the deck gives you only 1-2 options for the approach to minimize damage/loss each round. Try it yourself and I am sure you will find the same findings. I've recorded how often I've been "Punished" by the gm for trying to finish off a mob when the gm (Ai) has decided "You have done enough damage this turn. Pass now, or you will regret it." and lost a match. The enemies somehow have "just" the right cards to screw your party if you do anything but what the game wants you to do.\n\nThe game doesn't really have as much luck as you think it does. In my 70+ hours of play, I've noticed my party fails rolls around 33% more than enemies do. If you manage to bypass enemy blocks, and damage AKA....look at the game board, look at all the possible movement, and "Hope" that the enemy doesnt have 2 pocket moves/super smash/instant kill cards...and you'll win. That takes time, imagine if you had to plan every move in real D&D for 5-10 minutes to make sure your warrior won't get blitz krieged when you pass your turn or better yet, your warrior is in perfect aoe chop range....you stacked 12 chops in your deck...and none come up for 3 turns. I get 2-3 rounds in a row where I have no attack cards and an enemy has ~10-12 Hp left and it drags on to tedium. I stack my decks for builds, but my "attack" cards all sink to the bottom or when they do come up, I'm so far out of range that they're useless.\n\nThere was once a fight where I had to occupy squares against 5 enemies, and even though I've beaten it consecutively since then, I once sighed in frustration because a "Healer" priest on the other side....was down to 10 HP. My warrior had a 14 damage attack I "saved" for 2 turns to finish her. My mage only had a sneak along walls movement, I snuck up behind her, occupied a sqare, force blasted her into my warrior's lap and....She pulled out a pocket Mighty Bludgeon, my warrior failed "All" 3 of his armor rolls with 1's and the match was over in a blink. Stuff like this happens "Often". Way too often. The only way to win this game? Put about 100+ hours farming purples from matches you've already beaten until you can "Overgear" for the new fight...and beat this crooked system. I can't even get my money back, but I did have at least some fun before the game got unfair.\n\n\nSo please, login to the game, read the chat, you'll hear the same thing. Don't listen to people who have put in less than 20-30 hours into this. They haven't hit "The Wall" I climbed the wall, I've won against ogres, demons, cthulhu, and everything else....but its not worth it. its not worth the twenty dollars I put into this crooked game.","July 29, 2015","false","105.2"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

Interesting game play.  The graphics are about what you'd expect for a java based game, but if you're playing this game you probably are much more interested in the atmosphere and game play.\n\nEach dungeon is basically a set of room battles, and cards are dealt to both sides that they can use during the fight to move, heal, hack... etc.  The biggest issue for me was that after each room battle was completed, your health and card deck was completely reset, so worrying about future battles at all doesn't play into the current battle.\n\nProgression of your characters is somewhat stiffled if you don't purchase an extra loot "slot" that gives you an extra toy after you win a fight, increasing your chances of getting better gear.  The game has other areas littered with pay for play "opportunities", which in my opinion is never justified, although for a game of this caliber, is plain silly on a computer platform.  This game is belongs on I-pads or other such limited computing power devices, and is probably a little below average in those markets.  All in all, if you have an game pad, X-Box or are 12 years old, this game may hold some limited draw for you.  It's definetely not a D&D tribute, or even that in depth.   But for a free download, it could hold your attention for a couple days if you're an RPG or adventure fan.\n\nI do applaud the effort though.  We neeed more games like this in the genre, but a more depth and challenge would be nice for me.","July 23, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","6","0","0"

There's zero tactical depth and variety in this game because all kinds of damages are just direct damage (DD). If you're looking for interesting creature spells, you'll just be disappointed. Most attack cards in this game are either "Melee attack dealing 2/3/4/5/6/etc damages with a range of 2/3/4/5/6/etc tiles" or "Magic attack dealing 2/3/4/5/6/etc damages with a range of 2/3/4/5/6/etc tiles". Honestly, there's no creativity at all in card design.\n\n2. Ugly card artwork unless you think cards like this (http://wiki.cardhuntria.com/wiki/Cards/Stab) and this (http://wiki.cardhuntria.com/wiki/Cards/Strong_Stab) are eye candies.\n\n3. 100% Pay-to-Win: If you don't pay real money to buy chests that offer powerful items (in the forms of "rare", "epic" and "legendary" items), you won't have any chances at all to win in PvP. Yes, you might still beat low level PvPers equipped with cheap items. However, you'll definitely be killed by high level players who have spent hundreds of dollars on buying powerful gear. People who say this game isn't P2W are just blatantly lying.\n\n4. Stupid storylline: Every quest is just "kill this evil character (insert name) to obtain this valuable item (insert name)".\n\n5. No in-game deck builder. No in-game item and card database. Good luck wasting your time on Google.\n\n6. Mentally ret@rded AI: If your character has just 1 HP left and an AI enemy with attack cards in hand is next to him, don't worry! Because the AI enemy will just end the turn instead of using the attack cards to kill your character. The AI in this game is just dumb as hell. The developer only uses numerical advantage as the means to make AI enemies difficulty to beat in this game.\n\n7. Extremely slow development progress: Currently, there're only 3 races (human, elf, and dwarf) and 3 classes (warrior, priest, and wizard) available for team building. The player community has been asking for the 4th class (e.g., rogue) for over 1 year already, but the developer has done *NOTHING* at all in widening the range of class or race. Instead, the developer has only kept churning out adventure modules that offer stupid storylines and more powerful items to milk players' wallets. After all, as I stated above, the only way for you to stay competitive in PvP is to maintain an arsenal of powerful items.\n\n8. The game server can be down without any explanation or prior notice from the developer. They're probably using a toaster to host the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a digital card game with tactical depth and variety, go play Magic The Gathering Online. Don't waste your time and money on this sub-par title. I wish I could request a refund for the money spent on the campaign modules. According to the stats provided by Steam Charts, the number of peak players has tumbled by over 80% (a loss of around 5000 players) since the game was released on Steam a month ago. This hard fact is another strong evidence that Card Hunter is just a huge P2W disappointment.","August 4, 2015","false","180.3"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","4","16","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/recommended/293260/","tartrazine","Tartrazine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/","1509 products in account","As thematic and boring as THAC0Card Hunter's premise is that you are playing a pen-and-paper role playing game that is run by Gary, a novice game master, who is bullied by his neckbeard brother, and has a crush on the hot pizza delivery girl. These brief interludes before every campaign mission are easily the best part of the game. They do a great job of capturing the humor and nostalgia of every nerd's high school pen-and-paper role playing sessions. Sadly, these story sections don't really mesh with the gameplay. Gary introduces the missions, but there's never any dialog during the combat. It feels like someone wrote the story and then the combat system was farmed out to a different team. The gameplay just isn't as fun as the story.\n\nThe first big problem is all those Cards you're Hunting. Each item that you equip adds its entire set of 3 or 6 ability cards to your character's deck. If you understand basic UI design (unlike the Card Hunter devs), you'd probably expect the game to have a character screen that clearly shows which cards each piece of equipment is adding to your deck. Maybe with a column of equipment slots, with each item's cards shown to the side. But they didn't do that. So maybe your second guess would be that all the cards in your deck are at least organized sensibly, so that if your mage's deck contains two Firestorm cards from his staff, and a third Firestorm from a magic ring, the devs would at least program the game to give you the OPTION of clearly showing those three Firestorm cards all together, presumably beside any other fire spells that are in your deck, right? WRONG AGAIN! This cool cards-from-equipment idea was handled in the WORST way possible - each item's cards are just squished against each other in the deck, without any sorting or clear visual boundary between the sets of cards. And to make things even worse, some missions will force you to change much of your equipment (for example, you'll need lots of attacks that hit multiple enemies for a mission that swarms you with goblins) but there's no way to easily switch between "decks" (equipment loadouts), so you're stuck wrestling with the terrible interface much more than you should have to.\n\nOh, and when you're browsing a shop (there are several, presumably just to make shopping more frustrating, since there's no danger or cost involved in moving between stores) whenever you mouseover an item so that you can actually see what its cards are there's a cute little unrolling scroll animation before you get to see what its cards are. And no, it can't be disabled. You have to endure it every... single... TIME when you're just trying to slog through your mess of equipment. (Did I mention that I've put several hours into the game but still haven't earned the right to sell crappy equipment? I know you get to sell junk eventually, but it takes way too long to show up.)\n\nCards have some basic numbers to show how much damage they do and their maximum range (although these don't increase to reflect passive buffs), but anything more complicated than that requires you to zoom in on the card to read a mess of confusing keywords that should have been replaced with icons. (The keywords are such a mess that some "piercing" type weapons do "penetrating" damage that ignores armor. Really?! You had to use two different terms that have the same meaning everywhere but in your game? You couldn't call them "thrusting" or "stabbing" weapons?)\n\nNext problem - movement! I like games where the position of your units is important, but movement is very cumbersome here. You can't move unless you have a card that specifically lets you, and you can't "save" some of its movement for later in the turn. Combined with the fact that you only get to play one card before the enemy gets a turn, you will often run into infuriating situations where enemies move just out of range, making your hand full of attack cards useless. Each adventurer does always get a basic movement card in addition to whatever cards he randomly draws from his deck, so you're not completely reliant on getting lucky and drawing a movement card, but it just isn't enough.\n\nIt's crucial to know how much health each character has left, but the number is often obscured (There are lots of alternate skins for your heroes that you can buy with real dollars, but their appearance doesn't change to show how bashed up they are). You can see your adventurers' health numbers at the bottom of the screen, but it's not shown as a health bar or anything else eye-catching like that. Just numbers.\n\nHere's a bonus tip for slogging through this review of all the game's problems: Gary will give you pizza (premium currency) so you can get a free taste of stuff that normally costs real money (such as hero skins) but the game lets you spend the pizza on actual useful stuff like club membership for bonus loot.","July 17, 2015","false","25.4"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","4","16","3","1"

There is no choice involved at all, no character customization beyond choosing 1 of the peices they sell and equipping gear with no visual component. The DM characters constantly remind you with bad jokes that your not playing anything resembling the games initial appearance. Its all fighting, getting gear and leveling up.\n\nIf you want a game where you play levels, something like angry birds with a bit more stuff going on, then go ahead, its well made for that.\n\nIf you had hoped for anything more, such as rolling a 20 sided die or any die, making choices with saving roles, etc, this is not that game. Its not even a card game, so dont expect that either.\n\nSo im not saying its bad, im saying its not anything special and i dont reccomend mediocrity.

I fail to see what makes it worthy with the other games on steam. The baordgame style is enjoyable, the tutorial is thorough (even if it does a bit much of the hand holding). It fails in it's disguise of of free to play. Sure you can play for free but it quickly points out the things you won't get unless you pay. Even still, I don't have a problem with this system. You  get to play and see if you like it and just not buy if you don't find it enjoyable. What I have a problem with is the insane price jump for simple stuff. For $19.99 you get the actual game plus 100 pizza (in-game premium currency). That's crap when considering the game isn't worth $20- No voice-overs just odd sound effects for dialog pop-ups, no live action, pretty basic boardgame style play with nothing all that new brought to the table, and certainly nothing compelling for a $20 game and this title has the nerve to push for a monthly fee (that is optional but still thats some bs).\n\nI'm a frugal steam gamer. Thanks to steam sales, I've been able to enjoy amazing titles with little more than $20 (I tend to burn too much of that on beer and use the change for videogames :-() in my pocket at any given time. But this game will never compete with those deals (most recently Depth >$10 for a full game and crap my pants fun!). The price for pizza is between $4.99 to like $98.00 (150 and 3,800 slices respectfully)! That's insane! This can be used for premium gear as the game quickly points out 3.5 hours in. I have mobile games that are more cost effective than this with better graphics and sound.\n\nShort and simple is this, if this game advertised itself as a $20 FULL game on steam it wouldn't get a 2nd look but I'd at least have more respect for it. There are waaaaay too many titles (especially the random badasses that go on 80-90% sales for no damn reason other than that the sun came up that day)  it can't compete with with at the same relative cost. This game hides it's price tag until play it and when it shows itself it is a bloated mess of cost. I would never recommend this game to my friends because with this cost structure they'd laugh at me, tell me to play Path of Exile, and to take note of how a real free to play game is suppose to be setup.

Having the cards linked to items seriously hampers the deck-building aspects of the game.\n\nThe dungeon playboards are extremely repetitive and having to repeat them to level another character is very tedious.\n\nHaving to join a "club" to get additional loot items is also ludicrous.  I also note that more often than not the better items wind up being in the "club" slot.\n\nIf you're into watching grass grow, being irritated by odd DM's, and restrictive repetitive cards then you might like it, but I'd advise everyone to step away from this one.","July 17, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 22 people (5%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","5","1","22","3","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OHGODTHEBEES/recommended/293260/","OHGODTHEBEES","Cardassia Did Nothing Wrong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OHGODTHEBEES/","160 products in account","This game has weird mechanics that leave you saying 'Oh come the ♥♥♥♥ on' way to many times, especially the fact that you can't move your characters without a move card. As you are only likely to get 1 move card per draw for the character, you will often find yourself stuck in the same position as enemies just walk away from you and you are unable to follow having used up your move card and you don't get new cards until you end your turn. This becomes very annoying when enemies start cover the floor with damage over time spells.\n\nThe lack of the ability to move your characters around without a card to move is really, really annoying. Pure and simple. The fact that the enemy's constantly move away from you makes it even more annoying. The fact that some enemies make standing still punishment for you even even more annoying.\n\nOf course all your attacks also come in the form of cards. You cannot reuse them. You can have a character use up his 1-2 attacks and not really be able to do anything against the enemies around him unless you end the turn to redraw cards. Half of the games I played featured my dwarf sitting there doing nothing while being attacked simply because I wanted to use my other characters.\n\nI cannot stant the mechanics. Maybe if you only controlled 1 character at a time it would be more workable, but having your party stand around and do nothing but get hit while you're moving your mage around to do something, then having them hit again as you launch off a couple spells without doing much of anything isn't an enjoyable system.\n\nI do not recommend this game.","July 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 53 people (15%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","15","8","53","4","0"

It had many components that you would think would fit perfectly well, but the main problem with this game is:\n\nThe game has this repetitive grind to it because it makes you fight the RNG (random number generater),especially near the end of the campaign.\n\nThe missions/modules/enemies always seem to have a major advantage. Never have I seen an enemy without at least one attack nomatter what when they draw while more than likely I seem to go for rounds without getting anything but move cards. Enemies sometimes come in hordes which seem not bad since most hordes just share form a single deck but the problem start to arise when you notice that while you take a whole turn to move one character, for the enemy actually takes one turn to move everyone.Theres also the fact that the enimes have better cards than you most of the time which don't make much sense for the levels sice you can only come in within certain levels and if your overlevelled then you have to lose some cards and power tokens to make it "fair"\n\nThe game rolls seems rigged. I can't tell how many times that this game gave me a hand that could comlete annilate a foe but for some reason ALL its defence cards block everything, even when my cards have stuff like "hard to block" or they have "bad luck"(it essentially makes it s the dice roll goes down by 1), it gets so lucky and procs each and every block card.\n\nI mean theres one level in particular which is called "Return to the Astral Shrine" which essentially is impossible for me because even with armour destoying cards, bad luck and any other cards that make enemies lose cards, the enemies in that room just make it impossible because thay always have a card that blocks 5 damage, they only need to roll a 4 ad it doesn't matter whether is works or not they keep that card. But the problem with that is that they seem to always have one of those cards in there hand no matter how many times you destroy it! I mean I once save two cards that did 14 damage each so I unleashed it on one foe and it happend to have two armour cards which successfully rolled a +4 for both of the attacks I did, which lead to my attack that had the chance to do 28 damage to do a total of 8.\n\nOverall, I think that this game has it's charm but the fact that even though it's free to play, it feels like it tries to rig the game and force you to buy so that you can actually progress.","July 31, 2015","false","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat flows extraordinarily well and is pretty easy to understand.\n\nHowever, this game does come with some notable flaws: Card draw and deck size. There are a few cantrips scattered throughout what I've seen so far, some even going so far as to allow you to take another action after drawing the card. These lack of cantrips can seriously drag a game on or even completly screw an attempt over. You can continue to draw only movement cards, or armor cards, or block cards. This gets highly frustrating, especially when it happens two, three, or even four rounds in a row. Being able to opt into slimming your deck size down might help this a little bit. Perhaps this is handled later on down the line and I just haven't gotten to it.\n\nOn the other hand, it does have some great mechanics. Your choice of cards (or, rather, items which have cards attached to them) plays out as a big "Risk vs. Reward" when comparing cards from a single tier. Do you want an armor that has three "Armor 1. Keep."s, or one that has one "Armor 1. Keep.", one "Armor 2. Roll 4+", and one "Armor 2. Keep. Roll 4+"? Further, the usage of monster groups that use a card pool is a very clever idea that I for one would never have considered; it helps to balance out combat between 3 player characters and many more enemies without bogging down combat by making groups move at once.\n\nOverall, it's an awesome game. Highly recommend it.","September 16, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enough said there.\n\nGiven there's no true pay to win or catchup mechanisms, however, PvP tends to be won by the guy who's been around the longest. Since this PvP is what most would consider the endgame, this means that the game eats itself as it ages.\n\nAttempts have been made at making the game more evangelical. Leagues, particularly limited format ones, are incredible, and maps you create can be added to the game in the Mauve Manticore dungeons, which are finally firing once per month like they stated when they first devised the idea. Further, Aloyzo's Arsenal allows players to submit custom items which can be added to the game.\n\nThe issue here is that none of their evangelical work gets to the heart of the problem, which is that their loot design denies new players the ability to try entire categories of strategies - burst mage and vampire priest being the worst offenders - for their first months of playtime. And if a set of ranked maps favors these old-player builds for that month, well, Card Hunter likely has lower new player retention that month.\n\nBasically, the game needs to ensure that there's no exclusivity. Stay to win is almost as bad as pay to win.\n\nStill, play the PvE. It's incredible, and you'll have a blast.","December 21, 2015","true","386.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only downside is that hands each round are completely random from your deck, so it is possible to have a completely useless hand that you dont need.  But it is balanced out considering enemies seem to suffer from the same problem.  This game is not pay to win and the prices are very reasonable for unlocked content.  There is no real plot,  each mission has its own mini story.  The dialogue is humorious and seems to cater to people who play allot of table top role playing games.  You get to choose 3 classes and 3 races.  The race you pick determines the mobility and hp of your character.  As for the classes all 3 of them have thier advantages and disadvantages.  The cards you get for each character is determined by the items you equip.

Position your adventurers on a grid map and do battle with monsters using the spells and fighting techniques represented by cards that your adventurers get from the equipment you choose to equip them with.\n\nIt has a decent competative MOBA multiplayer as well as a 2-3 player co-op campaign.\nThe purple prose of the modules provokes just the right amount of nostalgia to invoke OG Dungeons and Dragons.\nThe competative balance ebbs and flows with each expansion, but is generally pretty good.\nThe difficulty of the singleplayer/coop campaign varies WILDLY depending on the specific scenerio, any handycaps you may choose to apply, and how you spec your toons.\nExpansions/DLC are fun and flavorful if somewhat short and occationally punishingly hard.\n\nOverall a very nicely designed TSG with a good deal of depth and a strong competitive following.

So if you fit into that niche this game is for you.  And it's free.  Yes you can spend $$$ and buy gold or pizzas which are used to but extra items/unlock extra quests or club memberships (which get you extra loot items), but you don't need too at all.  The game can be played without spending a penny,shilling or whatever you have, and still very fun.  I actually bought one the AotA pack just because I wanted to support the devs for all the fun I have had with this game and help them expand it and continue on improving it.  Or maybe just feed them or put a roof over their heads etc.\nI spent 6 hrs on this game when I first started and many more before I purchased the extra pack.  I didn't play this before it was on steam and now I miss not knowing about it from previous edition.  It plays like a RPG where you choose your characters and then select quests (or mini modules like old school Dungeons and Dragons) then it turns into a tactical board game with cards attatched to each of you characters to use during the battle.  Your cards are determined by what items/weapons/armor etc. you give your character and their class and race.  Very easy to pick up but mastering your items, cards, and using your turns will take some experience.  You may have to exchange items per each battle, sometimes losing badly to learn how each part of the module works and enimies you fight.\nArt work is fantastic, bringing me back to the 80's with the old D&D module artwork and style.  Very nice dialoge and narrations during play and some good comedy thrown in to boot.  Try it out, you can't really lose it's free for petes sake.  Hats off to a great game and as of so far I've seen a fantastic dev team working hard to update and keep the game running even after a large influx of players thanks to Steam.  Haven't played the multiplayer as of yet but will soon enough as friends play this too, will update my review when I get there.\nOnly downside I can pick out right now is you can't play offline.  You have to connect to the games servers to play even single player, so if your offline or the servers are you can't seem to play.  Not a terrible problem since once again it is free but the only negative I can say about this great game.","July 23, 2015","true","71.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a turn-based card strategy game. You form up three characters as a party to complete the campaigns and earn items in each battles. Even though this game has pay-to-win features and also memberships, but it hasn't affect much of the gameplay. You too can earn pizzas (cash currency) in certain rounds. You can either play it in a single player, where you command three characters. Or in a cooperative-gameplay, where three humans players control one character each. The campaign can seem rather boring as you get deeper into the jungle, as you need certain strategy in order to complete the round. Nevertheless this card game fuses together with item looting lets users to configure and mix-match their character abilities. The tutorial has been very helpful and witty at times, with an amateur player joking with the game master.\n\nFor network connectivity, this game is pretty stable. Suitable for Asian players too, however it maybe hard to matchmake with co-op players due to the timezones.","October 18, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite simple and casual but still 'deep' enough for people who are not really into casual stuff.\n\nThe things I like from this game are:\n1. It has a unique system that a character's deck is built from whatever equipments the character has.\n2. RPG element, characters can be levelled up.\n3. All characters are free to recruit from the first level. If you feel that you have picked a character that does not fit your style of play, just go recruit another one.\n4. You can name your character\n5. You can play alone or together with your friends, no problem.\n6. The artwork is good, I like it\n7. It's FREE!! Why are you hesitating??\n\nOther things (not bad, not good, but maybe you might want to know):\n1. Costume/cosmetic is only represented by the character token. Real money is needed for these character tokens, they are not cheap but not really important either.\n2. Everytime you cleared a battle in campaign mode, you will get loots. There will be an extra loot on each post-battle screen, you could only get that random extra loot if you're some kind of a premium member (this involves real money). The extra random items are not always good.\n3. There are also some storylines/campaigns which need your money to be able to be unlocked.\n4. Is this P2W? So far I can't give you that answer yet because I only play on the co-op mode :P\n\nI rarely engage in the PVP mode but so far the single and co-op mode has been fun for me.","August 13, 2015","true","68.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/isese/recommended/293260/","isese","Amber (琥珀)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/isese/","129 products in account","I have fully enjoyed my time playing this game thus far and, for a sound investment of $0, it's one of my cheaper experiences. The combat flows extraordinarily well and is pretty easy to understand.\n\nHowever, this game does come with some notable flaws: Card draw and deck size. There are a few cantrips scattered throughout what I've seen so far, some even going so far as to allow you to take another action after drawing the card. These lack of cantrips can seriously drag a game on or even completly screw an attempt over. You can continue to draw only movement cards, or armor cards, or block cards. This gets highly frustrating, especially when it happens two, three, or even four rounds in a row. Being able to opt into slimming your deck size down might help this a little bit. Perhaps this is handled later on down the line and I just haven't gotten to it.\n\nOn the other hand, it does have some great mechanics. Your choice of cards (or, rather, items which have cards attached to them) plays out as a big "Risk vs. Reward" when comparing cards from a single tier. Do you want an armor that has three "Armor 1. Keep."s, or one that has one "Armor 1. Keep.", one "Armor 2. Roll 4+", and one "Armor 2. Keep. Roll 4+"? Further, the usage of monster groups that use a card pool is a very clever idea that I for one would never have considered; it helps to balance out combat between 3 player characters and many more enemies without bogging down combat by making groups move at once.\n\nOverall, it's an awesome game. Highly recommend it.","September 16, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is I expected this game to suck.\n\nIn reality it is a very addictive, and fun game. It mainly focuses on combat and party optimization. People complaining that the cards they draw are too useless simply dont know how to deckbuild and probably max out on armour but use only crappy weapons. The community seems pretty friendly and helpful so far and there is lots of low level player so you wont get trashed as soon as you start.\n\nI wouldnt take anything out of the exisitn game but I do wish that they would add more classes are you are currently limited to 3.

I grew up playing tabletop dungeons and dragons among many other systems. This is a simple easy to use game that emulates the gaming experience of a tabletop RPG game using cards, amor pieces that translate to attacks and abilities and an almost board game style layout with floor tiles you travel along as you play. Its like combining a card battle with a stradegy turn based game with the dungeons and dragons (Medieval) setting and feel (its actually more generic then D&D but I figured it would be the easiest trigger word description).\n\nYou have a quarky new DM (Dungeon Master) that narrates as you progress by describing the scene; you and enemies you encounter, as well as a cast of other characters that chime in periodically, like the pizza delivery girl, his brother the veteran and cruel DM and his mom.\n\nOverall Im giving this a good review because it was free, easy to use yet still challanging and very well done. Ive been playing it non-stop since I bought it and still have yet to complete it. You finish one dungeon, 3 more pop up.  You can have multiple characters including multiplayer ones. The roster is pretty basic: Warrior, Cleric, Mage, but you can mix them up by buying new characters at the tavern, change their appearance and buy them new weapons, armor and magical items which totally customize the game play!\n\nIf you were ever a fan of tabletop old school RPGs this game is atleast worth a look, its free anyways lol","July 23, 2015","true","91.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since you're purchasing actual content, it doesn't leave you feeling sullied when you hand over the cash, even if the individual purchases ultimately add up to the cost of a AAA game.\n\nThe power token system ensures that even very early game loot will have a place in your end-game party builds. Higher level gear requires more and more tokens, you'll never possess enough tokens that you can deck your character entirely in high level gear. It's a clever idea, and well implemented.\n\nI haven't touched the multiplayer, but this is where, I imagine, the pay2win issues are a little more at the forefront. There are no item rarity restrictions, and legenday / rare items are a very powerful and central part of many pvp builds.\n\nProtip: When starting out, you'll be given pizza to spend on costumes and chests. You don't have to do so. Spend that pizza on card hunter club membership instead, it will make playing the campaign much more enjoyable.","October 22, 2015","true","86.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your character's equipped gear determine the skills ( cards ) that can be used in battle, those skills ranges from moving cards to blocking cards to healing to utility and attack cards with merged cards that allow two actions i.e( attack and move ) . Said gear can be equipped in slots that you gain when you level up your characters. That gear is sperated into 5 catagories ( common, uncommon , rare, Epic and legendary ) with the rarer varity gaining you powerful skills, said gear is also further seperated into gear that require power tokens - which you gain from leveling up - power tokens are also seperated into minor and major power tokens, they serve no purpose but as a prequiste to equiping gear.\n\nIs it P2W : No, it is not. Spending money on the game yields you cosmetics and extra content, represented in more campaign modes i.e. ( citadel in the sky, attack of the artifacts) and treasure hunts that yields you a single Epic class gear.\n\nIs it fun : Extremely.\n\nDoes have any flaws : Yes. As with all fun games you want more. I would have liked if it had more classes ( rogues , scouts..etc. ), out of combat focus even if it was just yes or no choices and steam work shop support for player created campaigns.\n\nVerdict : Very fun game to play with amazing content to match 8/10\n\nTl;dr : Xcom meets D&D in a weird card game like manner , easy to play hard to master, free to play , turn based , amazing content , paying unlocks more amazing content , wish it had more things to do other than combat.","October 31, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is great. The combination of tactical combat, deckbuilding, and classic tabletop theming is great.\n\nAt a free price tag, I'd recommend Card Hunter to nearly anyone. I purchased the Basic Edition for $20 a long time ago and do not regret it.\n\nIt must be stated, however, I'm not a fan of buying in-game currency which CH does have. You can buy pizza which can be spent on Gold or "Club Membership" that increases the amount of loot you get from levels, with the bonus being at least as rare as your rarest find. Luckily, no real content seems to be hiding behind most pay walls, minus the treasure hunt missions for the various bundles.

The game is a blend of turn based Dungeons & Dragons style battles with a collectible card game. Blue Manchu has managed to combine the two types of game quite well. Each piece of equipment you attach to a character has a set of cards associated with it. This allows the player to quickly change their deck without going through and micromanaging every single card. In battle, the cards are drawn randomly from the pool each character has and are used to take actions. Movement, healing, attacking, and other status effects are all invoked by cards. This makes battles dynamic, interesting, and random.\n\nThere is quite a bit of content for free but the game can get a bit grindy at higher levels. Several expansion modules have been released that can be purchased in game. There are also a few other perks that can be purchased, such as an increase in loot drops and additional character images. None of this is necessary to enjoy the game and there is plenty to do without paying a dime. Blue Manchu has balanced the difficult task of having a free game that is not pay to win and is worth paying a few dollars for for players who really enjoy it. I would recommend getting the additional modules, as they are pretty fun and help level up a bit quicker.\n\nI first played this game when it first came out so my Steam playtime doesn't represent my full playtime. I had taken a break from it and saw that it was added to Steam. With the Steam release is the new co-op feature. This allows a person to each control a character and take turns. This has been a lot of fun with friends and adds another element to the game since it requires focusing on a single character rather than the whole team.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for RPG and CCG fans. The two genres are blended perfectly to create a unique and engaging experience. There's nothing else really like it.","July 18, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a board game that uses card game mechanics for combat, the cards in your deck are set by the equipment your characters have. The combat is in small 5 to 10 (usually) minute chunks so you can invest as much or as little time per session as you want. It's also an homage to old school D&D, with many of the chapters fashioned after classic modules. It is free with a P2P element, but (at least initially) it isn't as in your face as a lot of games are. Some people won't like paying the approximately $10-$12 to unlock content (a special dungeons pack and 2 expansions as of this writing each cost around that price) but it seems like there is enough content even without that. Did I mention there is PvP and multiplayer co-op? If you like strategy board games, card games, or old school D&D, you will love this game.

It is neither of those things. What you get instead is a fun little throwback to old school AD&D, complete with a perfect mimicry of the art and writing styles of that era of game design. And my god, it even plays like old DnD - just a simplified, reasonable version, dressed up with some crunchy deck-building mechanics. It's accessible, it's charming, and above all it's fun. It's a gem of a game.\n\nSo, why is Card Hunter a mixed bag?\n\nThe answer to that is Gary and Melvin.\n\nCampaign mode in Card Hunter is basically a three-character story. Gary is your GM, Melvin is his older brother, and then there's a girl from a pizza place. The pizza girl is totally fine as a character. Gary and Melvin make me writhe in my chair.\n\nImagine, if you will, a hobby shop. Imagine this hobby shop is in a crappy part of your city. Imagine its windows are so heavily plastered with comics and action figure ads from the 1970, all of which are faded and peeling and stuck on with tape. Imagine that you've gone inside this store, wrinkling your noise at the powerful funk of old books and spilled snackfood that fills the cramped, dirty space within. Imagine there's only one customer, fat and unwashed, paging idly through Bikini Mail Magazine. And now imagine that behind the cracked, ancient counter, lounging in a pool of his own adipose folds, is a forty-something man in a pit-stained old t-shirt and sweatpants, hyucking softly to himself as he optimizes his WoW build on his laptop.\n\nNow imagine you've collapsed that entire experience into a single person. That person is Melvin.\n\nGary is not much better.\n\nThanks to Gary and Melvin, Card Hunter is a wild roller coaster of highs and lows. You'll fight a sharkbear, and that'll be pretty cool. Then Gary will say something cringing and miserable and you'll want to claw your own eyes out. You'll perservere, though, and get to see some righteous module art about cannibal yetis living in a blizzard. And then Melvin will open his mouth and you'll dream about just punching him. Punching him until he stops moving. Punching him FOREVER.\n\nI've never seen a game ooze social awkwardness like this one, and it's a damn shame, because everything else about it is great. The devs clearly are familiar with old school DnD. They get what tabletop culture used to be like.\n\nAnd then they choose to make the faces of Card Hunter a distillation of all the worst parts of the people who play the hobby.\n\nMaybe they hate themselves?","July 15, 2015","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/recommended/293260/","captainstardog","Fireballs of the Eucharist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/","161 products in account","Card Hunter is a fun game and will give you a good 2-4 weeks of game play for no pay, unless you binge it--then you won't get as much out of it. Meh, your mileage may vary. I plateaued after a week, so take that for what it's worth. What's it like? Well, for an old guy like me, it's a pleasant bit of nostalgia. For younger players, it's a throwback to the old D&D tabletop games of well, my childhood--late 70's - early 80's, though a lot of the genre trappings of late 80's - late 90's are present. Let me tone it down a bit and explain.\n\nYou get three generic characters with basic item slots. Pick an elf, dwarf, or human for each, and pick a warrior, mage, cleric for each. Each item slot grants access to certain cards you will play in battle. Adventuring leads to better gear which grants better powers. There is a rough storyline in the "real" world of the game where you are reading the things that others say to you.. a game master, his brother, the cute girl, etc. Nothing heavy or great. Some funny stuff, but very light. You can alternatively play multiplayer for quicker loot and gear. I waited until I finished the main campaign to engage in multiplayer, but you don't have to. I forget, however, how soon you can start, and the nice part is that the game lets you know.\n\nEach adventure has a little backstory you can read, as well as a little backstory in "real" life you can read as well. You move game pieces around a battle mat, taking turns with the computer. It's all pretty self-explanatory unless you're completely new to this sort of thing. The game holds your hand just long enough to get you up to speed, so don't worry if you are new. It's worth a try if you think you might like to experience a taste of tabletop roleplaying, without so much roleplaying--actually none. It's all hack and slash. Not complaining, just saying.\n\nMost of the campaign adventures were way too easy, but still fun for the most part. Later level adventures get significantly more difficult and sometimes require strategy as well as luck of the draw to win, depending on your gear and choices. The last few tended to be annoyingly difficult, but I can overlook that. I actually was more disappointed that the campaign stopped when it did. I wanted more solo play. You may feel differently. I get the feeling that the last few quests were uncharacteristically hard because someone felt it necessary to downplay the fact that there is no more free content afterward. Could be wrong, but I doubt it.\n\nThe game gives you gold for completing quests and selling treasure rewards. Gear can't be sold until you make a few levels to decrease the chances you'll sell something you later wish you had kept. The game also gives you some pizza, which is the game currency that you will have to pay real cash to get once the freebies run out. They want you to spend it a certain way, which I think is a complete waste. Just my opinion. Here's a pro tip for you: If you can manage to play a LOT for a week, spend your pizza to get a one week membership. That way you'll get to keep the best treasures you earn rather than just gazing at them before moving on to the next battle. Because that's how it works, you open a chest and items appear. One item appears in a special box that you can only open if you are a paid member. Usually that item is a really good one. Not always, but early on it is. And don't laugh, some of those low level rares, epics, and legendaries are worth holding onto for later. Trust me.\n\nNow, about multiplayer. I find this aspect of the game more fun than playing chess with human beings. Some of the players are very good. Some are very arrogant and irritating. It's a mixed bag, but no better or worse than any other online community. Actually, it IS better than some communities. Here's another pro tip for you--for every game you ever play: Stay out of the online chat. The game developers have some strange ideas about who can play and who should be banned. Their game, their rules. I get it. Just not what I would do. I have kids who'd like to play the solo campaign, but nobody under the age of 13 is allowed to play. In a lot of ways that can be good, but if a good kid wants to play the solo adventures, I'm not sure why that's a problem. Remember when I mentioned my childhood- late 70's to early 80's? I was between the ages of 8 and 13 at that time. Just saying. Keeping the next generation of gamers away from your game isn't the smartest or most community-minded move, but rather a way of keeping old farts like me happy and spending money. But I digress. Anyway, there's also co-op, but I haven't played it, so I'm not going to comment on it. I will say, as for the pay aspect, in multiplayer, you can pretty much tell who's either spending most of their life in the game or spending cash to make it look as if they are.\n\nAnyway, if you think you'd like an interesting card game that uses tabletop pieces and strategy against human opponents that is easy to get into, you could do a lot worse. My biggest beef, however, is the way you kind of get forced into multiplayer after you finish the main quest, because, really, that's about all there is to do unless you pay to unlock extra adventures in the caimpaign map. Those may or may not be worth the dough. My guess is they are worth it if you like this game because, with the exceptions I noted above, the free content seems pretty much consistent overall. I enjoyed the game, but I didn't like it enough to spend the cash. It's worth trying.","August 6, 2015","true","215.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the way it is now some things need to change. Most situations feel like they need to be handled by more then 3 team members and the game overwhelms you in later missions with large amounts of NPCs that are both small damage and large damage leaning more in the favor of large damage enemies. Usually ending with you trying to prioritize the high damage enemies but taking too much damage or losses to consider the exchanges worth while.\n\nPros:\n\nSimple:\nEasy to learn, your abilities are based on the equipment you have, enemies aren't overcomplicated time bombs you don't want to go near, races are genericly balanced, and classes have designated equips.\nGreat Fun with Friends:\nCo-op with friends is a blast, makes everything twice as fun.\nComedic Writing:\nThe game can be funny at times making it feel more worthwile to play through the campaign\nEquiment:\nEasy to understand, a little hard to obtain without grinding lower level missions, and equipment is balanced with major and minor power tokens so you aren't a complete god against the AI.\nEasy to Change:\nYou don't have to stick to one party, you can buy new party members for a low cost of ingame currency and interchange party members at any time to fit your play style.\n\nCons:\n\nClasses aren't what they seem to be:\nThe classes can be built one of two ways, either all aggression or complete support roles. There are no effective in betweens because you're either losing out on damage or don't help the other members in your team.\nWizards aren't at all DPS, most spells at a wizard's disposal are weak or are easily snuffed out by enemy armors/blocks. Also most beginning damage spells are close range that deal no damage, meaning you have to sit in damage range just to do damage and this follows you well into mid game depending on your load out. The wizards that can control spells that manipulate the battlefield have no damage what so ever.\nPriests are squishy supports that can't stay in combat very long for the same reason, they do almost no damage. With the all aggression priests they have almost no support and once again can't stay in combat because they can't take a hit.\nWarriors are either high damage DPS with no range or medium DPS with range. Warriors aren't tanks either considering most NPCs will just chip off 50% or more of your member's HP without even trying. Warriors either move into range and then have the target immediatly move out of range afterwards or do little to no damage with longer range attacks.\nEquipment:\nIt will screw you again and again, most equipment is either okay but nothing substantial. Anything that's good either has terrible draw backs from using them or require so many power tokens you can't use anything else that's good until you're high level. Your equipment is determind by RNG so you might just get a bunch of stuff for warriors or priests, but get nothing for your mage. Essentially making that unit completly worthless unless you do a grindfest or buy new overpriced equipment. Main issues with equipment is you're forced to use low level equipment even though your other gear is leagues ahead of it and it's mainly useless in your missions. There isn't any scaling in gear level, you have your low level gear that doesn't require power tokens, mid range gear that requires minor power tokens, and high grade gear that requires either major power tokens or both major and minor power tokens. At max level team members, you only get 4 major power tokens and 4 minor tower tokens. Which you have to try and prioritize certain equipment slots over others, making you weak extremely weak in one department and strong in another. The Warrior class has 9 equipment slots, Mage 10 slots, and Priests with 10 slots. With most late game gear using 2 major power tokens you're already missing half your stock for only one equipment item. So now you're stuck trying to build for pure DPS or pure support for certain classes. There is no effective inbetween for both offensive and defensive builds, they both work against each other and flood your hand with either or, not a mixture of both.\nGold/Shop:\nMaking gold is stupidly hard uphill battle of RNG and selling extra equipment for almost nothing to buy new equipment. To be actually able to sell back items you don't use you need to get a renown of 7, probably about 8 or so campaign missions. Their main reason in doing this is to have players build a good amount of equipment before going and blindly selling off equipment they aren't using. Main issue with this is once you get to sell items they aren't worth much of anything unless it's rare or legendary equipment which still sells for a crappy amount of gold. Common equipment is usually worth around one to two gold, where rare and legendary sell for around 50 to 100 gold. Selling one legendary piece of equipment gets you enough gold to buy one mediocre item from the shop. Your main way of making gold is selling common extras of equipment and cheap treasure with your occasional semi-precious treasure.\nNPCs and RNG are jerks:\nNPCs won't move unless you do most of time making it hard to determine how to plan for a situation, most times the NPCs seem to be well aware of what you possess in your hand. NPCs seem to just get cards that undermine everything you try to do. They either have so much armor and block you can't do anything or their rolls against you and for themselves feel rigged in their favor most of the time. Most of their saving rolls are 4+ and they seem to get the rolls they need flawlessly at most points in time. My armors and blocks have a saving roll of 2 or better and I still end up failing them 90% of the time.\nRaces:\nThe different races don't work well together at all. Dwarves are all tank but no movement which makes them pair terribly with humans and elves because they just leave them behind in the dust. If you're going to play with a dwarf you might as well make the rest of your party dwarves and play defensivly. The only good time to have one dwarf is as a mage because they don't have to be front line. Humans are a balance of both health and movement making them your go tos for optional play styles and are able to switch between aggressive and passive play styles. Elves are all mobility with no health making them get in and out characters or complete avoidance characters. You're not staying in combat with elves, you're either dashing in to do a little damage then dashing out or attacking from afar. Elves don't pair well with other races because they just leave the other races behind and end up over extending themselves.\nLittle to no hand manipulation:\nThere are barely any card draws and some of them punish you for trying to get new cards that are better for the situation. There is little to no enemy hand manipulation unless you can specificly build for it and land the ability through the NPC's/Player's saving roles. So far the only enemy hand manipulation cards I have seen remove their oldest block or all of them or remove armor cards. Enemy NPC's will most likely do this to themselves before you even know what to use to manipulate their hand.\n\nMy current stand point with this game is neutral, I love the concept but hate the way the game is going at the moment. I'm left here to hope they change some of these glaring issues before I loose all interest for a game that punishes players for trying to build for multiple utilities. If you want to play it for fun's sake with friends you'll probably enjoy this game for a few sessions. But if you want to seriously play all the way to the end power to you, because this game is brutal with it's RNG and rolls for saves. To be able to continue to play for me there needs to be a serious rebalance with how classes work, how card draw works, and how the rolls/RNG work.\n","August 19, 2015","true","47.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mylakovich/recommended/293260/","Mylakovich","Chris P. Baconbite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mylakovich/","301 products in account","I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who grew up playing Dungeons and Dragon or who enjoys tactical board games. The art direction is perfectly suited for the medium and every card, icon, and character is easy to comprehend. The adventures are cleverly written to evoke the classic D&D style with a subtle sense of humor. From a gameplay standpoint, Card Hunter scratches that itch for meaningful descisions with the random card elements. By equipping different items before each battle, you can stack your deck with specific cards more suited to overcome the challenges. This will be essential to be able to continue as this game is quite challenging and most maps will require careful turn-by-turn planning and a bit of luck to be able to win. Don't hesitate to re-equip or shop for new items if the enemies are immune to a damage type or have a gimick attack.\n\nAs a free game it scores major points for not including any obnoxious elements like a limitation on play. The cash shop currency is optional and you can complete the singleplayer adventures with the default rewards. Overall this is easily the best tactical board game available on Steam.","July 16, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have had so much fun that I decided to pay $20 for the Basic Pack to support the devs. The only con so far is the connectivity issues, and those are already being worked on. I would recommend to play the game with friends. However that doesn't mean that the singleplayer isn't fun, I often will hop in to the singleplayer inbetween Co-Op sessions to level my characters and get more loot. The community is friendly and helpful, and the devs have been friendly (haven't interacted with them myself but a bit of browsing the steam forums for this game proves this).
