"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swerving2kill/recommended/331670/","swerving2kill","|CBW| BusBoyBud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swerving2kill/","139 products in account","The mechanics of this party game are great. I love being able to whip this game out and everyone can play as long as they have a smart phone... but it gets old rather quickly, especially if you can't find new people to play with. I'm seeing a lot of up-votes and the down-votes are not being taken seriously. I'm going to have to be that guy here and advise you not to buy this game in its current state - at least for said price of $25. The positive reviews are warranted, but would I buy this game for $25 if I knew what I know now? Absolutely not. This is for two simple reasons.\n\n1. There really are only two games worth playing in this pack: Fibbage and Drawful. You could argue You Don't Know Jack, but if you'd played it once, it's nothing knew. Besides, if you have more than 4 people in your party, you can't play this game, so it is almost always excluded at most parties. Word Spud isn't even a game. End of story. I wouldn't pay a dollar to play it. Lie Swatter is ok, basically a guessing game between two questions and the luckiest person wins. I never played it enough to see how many questions it contains.\n\n2. Fibbage and Drawful are the bread and butter of this pack. These together would be worth the $25, IF they actually had a reasonable amount of stock questions. From what I've heard Fibbage has around 200, and Drawful has ~600. Drawful obviously has the most replay value, but Fibbage seems to always be the favorite at parties. Unfortunately, after a few short hours, you see more repeats than you'd like to admit. Now if you like being the host of a party and don't mind the repeats, this isn't so bad, as long as your guests are different people every time.\n\nHowever, I really don't understand why new questions have not been implemented. Or why there isn't a way to have the community submit their own, or at least create your own for your own game. I'm sure the framework was never built to do those things, but why they thought 200 questions would surely be enough is beyond me. Even with Drawful, you begin to see repeats fairly quickly.\n\nWhat's worse is the developers state it is impossible to get repeat questions until you've gone through them all if you host on a single system. This has been contested by several gamers and I too challenge this statement. I've only hosted on one computer and seen repeats within a few hours.\n\nI might as well also note there are a lot of bugs: throwing people out of games, randomly not being able to select answers, etc. They are a nuisance, but don't really seem to deter me or the people I play with as the games themselves are so lighthearted in terms of competitiveness. If that is something that is going to bother you, then I would add that to the list of reasons why not to pick this up at its current price tag.\n\nThe developers themselves said they won't add new content unless the demand is there. Well consider this my demand.  I want to support these guys, but I feel a little cheated. I expected more out of this game than 5 hours. They've opened up an interesting platform, but I think they or someone else could do this genre better justice and increase replayability. They state you’re gonna need more than one party for this, and that's absolutely true. Because otherwise you'll burn out your audience real quick!\n\nUPDATE (1/5/2016): This review received more attention than I expected, so with the successor out on steam now, I feel compelled to give an update on the state of the game. It appears the developers due indeed believe there is demand for more content. Unfortunately that content is in the form of a sequal and a price tag of another $25. I can't speak for the this game's successor, but I can give an update on this games current condition. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to say... This game resurfaced for me on New Years Eve with a (reasonably) fresh audience. The game was still littered with bugs (i.e. no one being able to enter in answers, freezing, booting players, no input recognition, etc.), and the newcomers seemed to agree that only Fibbage and Drawful (though primarily Fibbage) was worth playing. Overall an enjoyable experience for the newbies, but a little lackluster for those who had played with me before. Simply put, the game still lacks polish and solid content.\n\nIt is a shame the developers have decided to neglect this game and move on to other titles. The platform they've created has a lot of potential, which I feel has gone mostly untapped. I think this platform yearns for a DLC format. Similar to the Heads Up mobile party game, you could buy\nthemed DLC packs for Fibbage or Drawful for just a few bucks. Hell, have a Star Wars themed pack, that would sell like hotcakes right now. Another idea is to sell additional games as DLC to add to your party pack. Giving users the abilityto hand-pick and personalize their party pack for when they host! This would increase the replayability of the game, especially with the same crowd. But at the very least, if they continue down this business strategy of separate releases, it would be helpful\nto connect the games, so you can access all the jackbox party games you've bought through one interface... Though, I don't see myself buying another one of these any time soon at a 25 markup.","July 23, 2015","false","13.0"," 426 of 486 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","426","486","16","5"

I love the games in the party pack.  They're a lot of fun.  My family and I have managed to get a few hours of entertainment out of them and I have immensely enjoyed the content.  You Don't Know Jack 2015 and Fibbage both feature Cookie Masterson, which is really the most important thing to know, with Drawful being the surprise hit of the pack.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack is a classic trivia game show environment where each question is posed, then each player is able to give their answers. Cookie is condescending and evil towards the folks who get it wrong, something that often provides a great spot of humor.\n\nFibbage XL is a fill-in-the-blank trivia game where each player gets to enter an answer, right or wrong, and then those answers are shuffled in with the real answer, at which point each player gets a chance to guess.  Points are awarded to players who get the question right, and to the players who are able to "trick" the others into guessing.  There are a few problems with Fibbage, mostly relating to the use of the language.\n\nFibbage's "true" answer can easily get lost in the mix.  For example, say the answer to a question is "Grand Canyon" and you type in "the Grand Canyon" and your friend misses a letter and types in "Gran Canyon."  You now have three VERY similar answers, with two of them being functionally correct, and the game won't detect it as being the same as the "correct" answer. This is both the source of fun in Fibbage, and a source of frustration.\n\nLie Swatter is a pseudo-trivia game where players must either answer True or False to the statements given.  Some of the "lies" are remarkably difficult to spot, and players will enjoy trying to guess them.\n\nDrawful requires players to attempt to draw things from the given category, and then other players will try to guess what has been... done.  After guesses are made, players must determine the true name of the category.  Like Fibbage, Drawful suffers from answer ambiguity in that adding articles or making typing errors can render the true answer indistinguishable from the fakes, but c'est la vie.\n\nWord Spud, the low point of the pack, is a word association game played by taking random turns adding to the words given previously.  So a 5 turn word order may look like this: Banana Split Decision Election Politics. Points are awarded by players voting on whether the given words were acceptable, so basically the points don't matter.\n\nThe games scored as individual games:\nYDKJ - 9/10\nLie Swatter - 9/10\nDrawful - 10/10\nFibbage - 9/10\nWord Spud - 6/10\n\nSo why No?\n\nPseudo-technical issues.  This game doesn't have actual local multiplayer support.  Internet connection is a MUST, so no taking this game to a party center unless they've got wi-fi.  The game requires that you sign each player into Jackbox.TV - admittedly not that difficult since you can do it from desktops, laptops, cell phones, tablets, toasters, etc. and use your "room code" to start the game.  However! This connection to the online service does not give you actual online multiplayer, either.  Players have to be able to see the host's screen in order to see the questions, the answers, and hear the awesome Mr. Masterson and streaming services have a significant enough delay to where YDKJ players would have a significant host advantage... sometimes by more than 10 seconds.\n\nIt gets hairy in practice, though - the people playing the game have to be comfortable with their individual devices, or one of you has to be technically inclined enough to be able to make sure everyone's devices are operating as expected for the entirety of the game. So if you've got a friend or relative or partygoer who doesn't have a cell, they're not playing, making this the least casual-friendly party game to date.\n\nThis leads me to my next problem - while I understand the need for the screen for Drawful, Fibbage, and Word Spud, I can't figure out why YDKJ and Lie Swatter aren't controller compatible.  I should be able to hand each player an Xbox 360 controller (or use my Big Button controllers) which require LITERALLY no technical experience to use and put each player on an even playing field.  Xbox 360 controller support is only for playing You Don't Know Jack in single-player mode.\n\nThat's ultimately my biggest problem with the system as it stands at release - in practice, the game is literally unfair.  My parents are in their fifties and my mother's an amputee.  We can't really play on an even playing field because my ability with the phone doesn't match theirs.\n\nSo, if you're going to get a group of friends together and they're all on equal footing in the smartphone world, then fine - this is a great game.  If you're going to include anyone else... nope.  Nope nope nope.","November 29, 2014","false","9.2"," 655 of 914 people (72%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","72","655","914","10","33"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AROAH/recommended/331670/","AROAH","Marcus Bresberg, Stockbroker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AROAH/","527 products in account","This is hands-down the best party game I've ever played. For the price of You Don't Know Jack alone, you get multiple great games, including an amazing Pictionary-style game that manages to not only have its own identity, but exceeds Pictionary in some ways, mostly in terms of quality of the prompts. I can't say Pictionary has ever asked me to draw "words" or "#throwbackthurs."\n\nMeanwhile, Fibbage manages to take the YDKJ-level of trivia questions and combines it with trying to fool your friends into choosing your convincing yet wrong answer. Would you guess that there's a group of people who celebrate by bashing each other with bags of fire ants? Neither would I, which is why I got 1000 points by tricking my friends into thinking it was feces.\n\nYDKJ is, of course, the best at what it is, and 2015 keeps with the trend of "ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SERIOUS" trivia, so while there's nothing really new about the gameplay, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Don't fix what isn't broken, after all.\n\nWord Spud is the only game that really falls flat for me. The description really doesn't explain what it is, so I'll attempt to do so. Have you ever played the driving game where you say a word, and then your friend has to say a word to go after that one that still makes sense? It's that. That's the whole game. They made a video game out of that. There's scoring, but the points are based on your friends voting on whether or not they liked what you said. There's literally no incentive to say "yes" to anything, so the game falls apart. I see the potential for a Cards Against Humanity-style "everyone puts something in and then you pick the funniest answer" game, but they instead made... this. It's fun for one round, but I don't plan on coming back to it.\n\nLie Swatter is essentially something you can put on to fill time at an actual party. Since it's the only game that supports more than 8 players, it works well for larger groups who don't want to leave anyone out. Unfortunately, since it's been designed to accomodate such large groups, the gameplay suffers, and it's essentially a game of True or False. It's certainly more fun than Word Spud, but nothing to write home about. Definitely reserved for things like family get-togethers, weddings, and the like.\n\nFor those concerned about how multiplayer works, don't be. While a couple of reviews have groaned about the smart device requirement, it really shows how creative the people at Jackbox can be, given the right tools. A game like Drawful has always required you to either play a Flash game on your computer or use some kind of accessory on your console, but in this case, if your device can run a modern web browser, you can probably use it to play these games (while I haven't tried using the WiiU gamepad, I would not be surprised if it worked). Fibbage would be outright impossible with any other input method, simply by design. While I can understand the frustration with YDKJ not using controller input, and I don't know why they didn't increase the amount of players thanks to bypassing the controller limitation, it's a small price to pay, when smartphones and tablets are as ubiquitous as they are.\n\nOh, and if you're looking to play online, I've found a solution (requiring multiple monitors) that involves using Google Hangouts to broadcast your screen that's hosting the game and having all of your friends play by watching the Hangout. Skype, unfortunately, has such terrible video quality that it's unwatchable, but I'm sure many other video conferencing applications will do a similarly good job. The game runs in Windowed Borderless, so you don't have to worry about constantly alt-tabbing, or anything, and the latency from Hangouts is short enough that you can all laugh at the same things at the same time. If you really want to have fun, you can even broadcast the game on Hitbox.tv, because the latency is short enough to where your viewers can competently play, albeit with a 4-second delay. Twitch is functional for playing Drawful, since you have so much time, but Fibbage and YDKJ are far too time-focused. I'd personally recommend streaming on your preferred site and then advertising the Hangout somewhere in the chat or on the page, for anyone wanting to join.\n\nWhile I'm concerned about the amount of content, considering multiple-hour play sessions are a regular thing, I've been playing a combination of only Fibbage and Drawful for nearly 8 hours with not a single repeated prompt, yet. I would definitely purchase add-on content, if any became available, as well.","December 1, 2014","true","21.4"," 80 of 91 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","80","91","3","0"

A cheesy gameshow with traditional trivia interspersed with a few more unusual rounds, like a quickfire true or false and a round which singles out the current loser to get themselves back into the leaderboard. It's decent, but the time based answering means that it's unsuitable for streaming and the 4 player max player count makes it less appealing when there are many friends or family over. Still, it's solid fun.\n\nFibbage and Drawful are the gems in the pack. Both support 8 players and both have a greater focus on player driven interaaction. Meaning your terrible drawings, guesses and lies become part of the whole game leading to some of the best fun you will ever have with party games.\n\nFibbage however lacks content, after playing for half an hour or so, questions started repeating. Drawful, on the other hand, took a very very long time until something even resembled a possible repetition. (Drawful is much harder to get a feeling of repetition since the answers and phrases are all so esoteric and outright nuts (which only adds to the fun).\n\nI explored the gamefiles, and saw an explaination. Fibbage only has 200 or so questions, while Drawful is closer to around 600. A rediculous disparity when both games are really great.\n\nFlyswatter and Word Spud are special situation games. They are neat, but cannot really stand among their peers. Flyswatter is basically a game you play if you have A LOT of people who want to play a simple trivia game in the form of true or false questions.\nWord Spud is the subjective game of the bunch, where how you win is directly related to what kind of people you play with it. Words are stringed together, one player at a time; whether you want to be smart, funny or write poop and pee jokes is entirely up to you and judged accordingly; as each input is judged by everyone else.\n\nBeing able to pretty much play all games (aside from You Don't know Jack) through streaming and also being able to play through mobile, tablet and web browsers makes this one of the most unexpectily well realised, accessible party games released in the last decade.\n\nIt is one of those technologies that wouldn't have worked 5 years ago, but now it is in the most fertile of environments, and it thrives.\n\nBoy, I just hope they add some more Fibbage questions though, or workshop support.","January 1, 2015","true","11.3"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","54","62","0","0"

It is easy for players young and old to get involved in, and even fun to simply observe. Everyone in the room is always laughing when this party pack is pulled out. The best part is – if one person purchases it and broadcasts it to a TV or even through Skype, anybody with a tablet or cell phone can join in the fun and play along.  The only downside is that you do see a lot of repeated questions/prompts in fibbage and drawful. That means that once you've played it enough, you'll know all of the answers. It'll make you look like a big shot when you introduce the game to a new group of friends, but inside you'll just feel ashamed.\n\nFibbage – Trivia based game where you try to fool other players with your lies.\n\nDrawful – Always brings out the most laughs in my experience. Drawings aren’t too precise, but that only makes things funnier.\n\nYou Don’t Know Jack – Another trivia based game, more head-to-head action and ability for another player to interfere with your game.\n\nWord Spud – Word associations and a lot of laughs. Can be nonsensical, so it isn’t always a family favorite.  Try making a rule to use quotes or song lyrics to make the end result flow in a hilarious fashion, or try telling a story . I find that this makes the game more exciting and interesting.\n\nLie Swatter – A true or false style game that is good for playing with larger groups of people. It moves pretty quickly and can get boring, but you can learn a lot from playing it while showing off your trivia knowledge.","July 12, 2015","true","17.6"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","31","36","3","0"

Get your friends together for some fun. I guess I'll be like everybody else and break the 5 games down one at a time.\n\nWord Spud:\nThe general consensus is that this game is bad. There's a reason for that, it's because it is bad. You'll play it once and then it'll turn into a Bad Rats-style joke. The game I played devolved into my friends and I typing "gay Alexis is gay" over and over. 2/10 standard rating 10/10 from IGN.\n\nLie Swatter:\nA mediocre game that you won't play much. True or false gets boring after a few rounds, even with categories like "Shaq rap lyrics" and "butt holes." (Those were the actual two final round topics I first got.) 5/10 standard 10/10 from IGN.\n\nDrawful:\nThis and You Don't Know Jack cannot be played very well without being in the same room. Because of that, I have not had a chance to get the full experience of Drawful yet. From what I've seen, though, it is the star of the show alongside Fibbage. I will try this at my next gathering. Approximate rating: 9/10 standard 7/10 "too much water" - IGN.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack (2015):\nIt's You Don't Know Jack. Like Drawful, I haven't gotten a good chance to play this one. However, I know how the game works. It's a silly gameshow, and it looks good. Approximate rating: 8/10 standard 10/10 IGN.\n\nFibbage:\nThis game alone is probably worth the full $25. Although it's slightly easier to play in the same room, you CAN play this online, and I recommend you do if you can't gather your friends. This game will create inside jokes for your friend group, such as when my friend said that Twister's original name was "Gay Games For The Family" and then later claimed a man had an addiction to "Gay Twister Games," while I determined his addiction was to "Sex With Small Animals." Fibbage is one of those games where sometimes it's just fun to lose. It's like Cards Against Humanity but more fun because you're never stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand. 10/10 standard rating 10/10 IGN. I would put Fibbage in my top 3 games of 2014 with Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart.\n\nOverall:\nFun games, even if you can't be in the same room. I'd give Jackbox Party Pack about an 9/10 overall. Two very excellent games and a good one carry the one mediocre and one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one, and I'd say it's an overall solid purchase.","January 14, 2015","true","21.8"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","24","36","6","0"

HOWEVER, your milage will vary (due to video transmission lag) with those NOT nearby.

I can't speak for all of the games, since the ones we played were Fibbage XL and Drawful.  After playing only those two games, and knowing how good You Don't Know Jack is by itself, I knew this would be worth it for myself.\n\nDrawful plays like a more ridiculous version of Pictionary where you also want to try and trick others into believing that the answer you provide is the correct one.  Have you ever tried drawing the phrase "Baseball glove is setting my hand on fire"?  Those are the kinds of things you get to try and draw, and the outcomes/answers can be hilarious.\n\nFibbage XL is where we spent most of our time, and it's amazing.  You basically get a statement/sentence that has a blank, and you need to fill in that blank with what you think is the correct answer.  All the answers from the players appear, along with the correct one, and you need to try and choose which one is right.  Again, being part of the You Don't Know Jack family, the answers aren't always going to seem normal.  Did you now that there's a Chinese dish cooked with the urine of very young boys?  You do now.\n\nIf you enjoy party games, you need to pick this up.  Of course how much fun you have depends on the players.\n\nMake sure you note that you need to use a tablet/smartphone/computer as your controller, as to play you connect to an online game room.","February 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Used my Surface (Pro 2) and Miracast to broadcast to the big TV.  Had no issues with the game itself running on the HD4000 in the Surface.  Miracast has a delay, but wasn't enough to be problematic in a game like this.\n\nFibbage was definitely the biggest hit. Most people complained that Drawful was a little too slow (and nobody's drawings made any sense). Lie Swatter was mostly a filler while everyone was waiting for others to congregate for Fibbage. YDKJ was enjoyable for me, but most others weren't into it (and the 4 player limit hurt this one too). Didn't even bother with Word Spud, nobody thought the concept was worth the time.\n\nFibbage alone though is great (and I'd buy this even if it was just Fibbage and YDKJ).\n\nThere were a couple occasional issues with people's browsers getting disconnected from the game.  Sometimes they would be able to put the same username and same room code in and immediately get reconnected, and sometimes they would try that and it would tell them to wait until the next game.  And worse, when someone gets disconnected, that means you have to wait for the timer to run out completely before moving on to the next question.  I think it should be a little more lenient in allowing a reconnect when it's the same username as someone who is already in the game.\n\nStill, the game is highly recommended for large gatherings (and keep in mind that it's designed for local multiplayer only).","November 30, 2014","true","8.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But having played this with three different groups of people I feel like I'm ready to write a review on it.\n\nThis game is possibly the easiest to access of all the multiplayer games I've played. As somebody who is used to playing Smash Bros and Left 4 Dead with friends, learning and playing this game is completely different to any other multiplayer game I've owned. You can play this game with both family and friends for a blast.\n\nAnd it's really good fun. There's usually laughter, competition and excitement depending on whatever one of the five mini-games you're playing.\n\nDrawful to me is the one that stands out and represents this group of games best. Whether you're making guesses to try and make the other people laugh or going for points with somewhat good drawings there's fun to be had. I'd say this is the most upbeat and casual game, with its easy to learn set of rules and charming style.\n\nFibbage is the competitive game, where you're putting trust into whoever's picking the category and having the rewards raised every round makes things more intense as the game goes on. You can easily go from last to first with a highly convincing lie, which means it's usually anyone's game.\n\nLie Swatter is the simple one where players won't have to worry about anyone else tricking them. It's all up to whether you know the facts and there's always competition with the fastest correct guesses and the scores being so close each round.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack seems to be one I've found only a couple of people who enjoy playing it. Some say it makes no sense, but there's something about its style that makes me want to play it. It's usually pretty terrifying being almost caught up to until the third round however. All most people want to do by then is spam the button and hear multiple screams at once.\n\nAnd lastly we have Word Spud. Nobody I've played this game with has really liked Word Spud all that much. It tends to get boring after a few rounds as it relies on a voting system. It's a great idea on paper but not so much in theory. I feel like I have to try and make it more fun for myself just to get some enjoyment from it.\n\nAs a game, this is worth its price for just Drawful and Fibbage alone. Starting up this game easily turns into hours of fun for everyone and it's well worth what you pay. I'm looking forward to when I buy the second party pack for even more fun!","March 4","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However the only game I have properly played is YDKJ 2015. And while I think it's a great game, I feel like it could be improved upon.\nI don't know if you remember this bu the 2011 game that used to be on Steam but no longer isn't had the option to play two player games. That's the major issue that I wish was there. I understand with the technology system being more advanced they are changing everything so that you can play with a phone or tablet. But if they had ran a similar system to the 2011 version, with the game mechanics, then I think it would make for great competition for local players who don't have the advanced technology option.\n\nHaving said that, the humour in You Don't Know Jack 2015 is full of banter, hilarity and humility. I really like the new soundtrack and audio commercials for the game and just wish that Jackbox would release the audio files for them. I mean, they did that for 2011, so if we could get a downloadable soundtrack then that would be great because we could then compare and enjoy.\n\nAll in all, depsite the fact I really play the Jackbox Party Pack for YDKJ 2015, I can safely say that this set of games is a great party favour for any set of gamers, whether that'd be casual or serious!\nGive it a try and see how you feel. And if you want me to take all that back, well guess what.... YOU DON'T KNOW JACK!","May 9","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also you've got to be in the right mood for the gags but some of them will hit. The game is US-centric but the quiz material is pretty universal with the occasional outlier).

However, unlike its Xbox 360 counterpart, You Don't Know Jack is unplayable. It's laggy, so you lose points every second your buzzed in answer doesn't register onscreen. Furthermore, one of the players in our game wasn't able to buzz in from her phone at all, since the buttons go grey after anyone else answers and won't respond to any of her inputs. Fibbage wasn't a huge deal, considering it isn't time sensitive as long as everyone enters an answer before the very last second, but not having 4-controller support for You Don't Know Jack completely ruins the game, and the whole experience was a clear example that much work needs to be done on the mobile device input support for this package.\n\nThe games may be great, but the performance isn't.

The use of a phone (or similar internet-connected device) as a controller is genius as it allows friends to play easily and without the need for additional hardware.\nMost of the games are incredibly fun too, with only two of the five games (Word Spud and Lie Swatter) being ones that you will soon forget about due to them simply not being particularly fun. Out of the remaining three Fibbage and Drawful stand above the rest and can be played for hours and still have you and your friends wanting to play more. They both lead to some hilarious moments as you laugh at each other’s drawing skills or silly answers. The two also remind me of the fun had playing Cards Against Humanity, which is very high praise indeed. You Don't Know Jack is decent too, though it will get picked less due to not being as entertaining, it is still enjoyable every-so-often.\n\nPerhaps the only real complaint that can be made about Jackbox is the limited amount of content for each game. While it will still take a while to see repeat questions for Fibbage and Drawful (which ruins a lot of the fun), or to complete all the YDKJ episodes, it will still eventually happen. And when it does there is unfortunately no DLC or Steam Workshop support to add to the longevity of the product. Hopefully this can eventually be patched in.\nThat one problem aside though, I would definitely recommend you play this game next time you have friends over.

The decision to not support multiplayer controller support, even for the games it could work in, really wrecked this game for me. When I bought the pack, I had a Nexus 4 that was shattered, a Kindle Fire, my girlfriend's Note 4, and 2 Logitech game controllers. Between the lag of connecting through the Jack.tv server when we were sitting right next to each other in the room, the lack of controller support, the difference in capabilities between our two working devices, the game was utterly unplayable. Jackbox has responded in their forums to the ocean of negative comments saying basically "This was our design decision. We can't and won't change it"\n\nIf it's true that making a game support 2 local controllers at once in a game that has ALWAYS supported 2 game controllers in the past is so impossible, that's a pretty tragic design decision. If it's not true, then why not just fix it and make the game much more playable and accessible?\n\nYes, lots of people have mobile devices now, but they're not all the same. Some are buggy, they crash or freeze. Not everyone has high end handsets that will work identically from user to user.\n\nI have always loved YDKJ, from the very first CD-ROM I got when I worked at Best Buy in 1996, through all the iterations including the web games. I'd love to get a copy of the 2011 edition on Steam but I guess it's been pulled. I really want to play this new one Jackbox, but I hate this controller decision. Please at least add support in the next iteration.","May 7, 2015","false","2.6"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

The game requires a local internet connection to play, but here's the kicker: you play the game on your phone! That's right! That means your Mom doesn't have to fiddle around with an Xbox controller, and you always have enough devices for everyone to get in on the fun!\n\nPlayable on any tablet or phone with a web browser, The Jackbox Party Pack is hands down the most non-gamer friendly party game I've ever seen, and it's about thirty million times better than trivial pursuit or other similar packages.\n\nThe five games are drawful, fibbage XL, You Don't Know Jack Trivia, Lie Swatter, and Word Spud.\n\nDrawful is a sort of pictionary inspired game in which you draw on your tablet. I haven't played a lot of this but it is great fun. Between 3 and 8 players can play.\n\nFibbage XL is my personal favorite, and is a spin on a balderdash type game in which you are given a trivia question and have to write a lie. Players then guess between all the lies other players made and the truth. Between 2 and 8 players can play, and it is totally hilarious.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack Trivia, aside from one amazingly stupid question involving Ralph FIennes in episode 3, is a very funny and well put together trivia game for 1-4 players.\n\nThe other two games are pretty weak, and largely ignorable. Word Spud is a weird game in which players just try to write funny phrases with a prompt for 2-8 players, and Lie Swatter is a game for 1-100 players that probably wont interest you unless you're really determined to try and get a zillion people together to play trivia.\n\nOverall the package is amazing value for money, and a party game that is actually a party game (an amazing rarity in gaming nowadays).\n\nUnconditional recommendation here.","January 28, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This amount of content you get for the price is an incredible deal which is worth it in the long run. This party pack is only good for people who have a family game night or play with a group at home. You can play with people in a different home but the comedy and experience is taken away from it. Now short reviews on the games themselves\n1. You Don't know Jack 2015: Honestly I played the 2014 version and compared to that one 2015 falls on its face. It's more awkward and the jokes dont hit as hard. It is a solid trivia game and is good for the price it is. This and the 2014 version have a lot of "episodes" which is a game session that has its own set of questions. So if you play this a lot I hope you don't memorize the answers otherwise its fun.\n2. Fibbage: This is a lying game. The game gives you a question and there is the real answer buried amongst a group of lies created by the other players. If other players pick you lie you get points, and if you find the truth you also get points. The questions are good at getting some ridiculous answers out of people and it is good fun.\n3. Drawful: This is by far the funniest and most solid game of the package. It is Pictionary and Fibbage combined. You have to draw the picture for the other players to guess and if you get them to guess the correct phrase you get points. The other players will create new captions so people will pick their answers and get points. You don't have to be an artist; honestly it is much better if you aren't.\n4. Lie Swatter: It is a game of competative true or false. It has some good moments overall its a nice quick game.\n$. Word Spud: This is a game where you connect words and the word I use has to be in the phrase you say next. I say Hammer you add Time and the next person says Piece and so on and so forth.  Honestly this is boring. There is no host to commentate and explain unlike the other games, its quiet and unless you have a really good chain of words it just isn't fun.","June 16, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Controllers are fast, precise, and offer tactile feedback. And for god's sake, let players use the keyboard. If the keyboard has n-key rollover and all four players are willing to crowd around it, let them do it. It wouldn't be fun, but it might work better for them than using smartphones. Or maybe I have controllers incompatible with the game and I want to use JoyToKey to kludge them into working. Even that would be sloppy and lazy on your part, and you failed to meet even those low standards. But, not only does this game not allow you to have more than one player to play using the keyboard, it actually allows NO players on the keyboard. That's right, this game lets NO ONE play on the computer hosting the game. A minimum of five devices is needed to play this game with four players. Good job!\n\nThe point is this: give your players options.\n\nTrying to play this game using smartphones, the ONLY WAY the game works, was an awful experience. It was a decent idea, but it does not work well in practice. The lag is a serious issue, which should not happen when everyone's in the same room. Minimal lag is acceptable for most of the game, but completely ruins the Jack Attack. We tried more than one phone that didn't work, which led to one player being forced to use a laptop. She was at a disadvantage because clicking a button with a mouse is slower than on a touch screen. Even that's no picnic, though. It still takes a significant amount of time to look at the phone and press the button, something you DON'T have to do with controllers, as they offer tactile feedback. It's a little thing, but these little things add up. Even worse, oftentimes when we would press the button, the input would simply not register. Some players were at a serious disadvantage because they had more lag than other players. Our phones, like most people's, are set to go dark after a few seconds of disuse, which is the desired behavior at all times except when playing this game. This is distracting and frustrating, because enough time passes between each question for the phone to turn off, and it's not uncommon for you to get caught with your phone off when it's answering time. And god forbid it's locked by then. You have to remember to turn your phone on ahead of time, or continuously rub your finger on the empty area of the screen to keep it awake. You think it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it really does significantly detract from the experience, knowing you have an unreliable piece of garbage in your hand that will screw you over unless you pay constant attention to it. Changing the setting is a hassle, needs to be done again once the game is over, and results in your battery dying even faster (which this game does a pretty quickly already.)\n\nThe idea to use smartphones was clever, but flawed in execution. Failing to support ANY OTHER INPUT MODE, even the DEAD SIMPLE keyboard, was a catastrophically bad decision, and it ruined this game entirely.","January 8, 2015","false","2.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","2"

Fibbage is an excellent game about creativity and lies. These two games, Drawful and Fibbage, are so great, that they make the whole pack worth it. Wordspud can be funny, sadly it has very little meaning. Most of the games are also much better if you can gather a lot of people. I'd say 5-9 is good.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack is the center of the pack, it contains all the earlier You Don't Know Jack games, how ever, it's a "quiz-type" game, and for three Norwegian teenagers, it was pretty difficult, so we had to guess most of the time.

It should be "Partial Controller Support" at best. So my purchase was based on a false claim.)\n\nThe one, and only thing I bought this game to do was to play You Don't Know Jack with my family around thanksgiving. I have a set of controllers and was extremely disappointed that the previous release didn't support them. This does support controllers, however! Well, sort of. It supports Controller, singular.\n\nIt only supports a game controller in single-player YDKJ mode. To play multiplayer, you have to use smartphones (or other computers) to load a browser-based controller app. This sounds neat but was plagued with problems - trouble connecting, getting disconnected a few times per game, phones falling asleep between questions because of no input for 15 seconds, laptop turning off the screen mid-game because of no input for 15 minutes, etc.\n\nSeveral of these issues (and locking up the first time I tried to screw someone, which was when we gave up) are likely because of being rushed out before thanksgiving - and I appreciate the effort, and all of us agreed that the bugs are reasonable for it being brand new. But several of them are fundamental design issues. And none (except the screwing lock-up) would have been a problem if I could have used the controllers I already bought, have used for years, and have already used in the Xbox 360 version of YDJK released 3 years ago.\n\nOf course, that's not the only reason to buy the game for many other people, since there are several other game modes, but that was the only reason I got it, and mostly for the short window of family gatherings. But the other games would have had the same issues with the smartphone controllers. I also feel deceived, as I bought it because the store page clearly says "Full Controller Support" and it absolutely doesn't have that.","November 29, 2014","false","0.5"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","2"

For the price it's pretty good, and so long as you don't play it too much in one sitting many of the games have a lot of replayability.  Easily 7/10, if they contniue to update and add to it then it couls slide on up to an 8\n\nThe Jackbox Party Pack is a really fun party game to play with friends.  One person with one computer has to own the game, and then all of their friends can connect with their phones or computers for free at jackbox.tv.  There are five games inclued, although personally, Lie Swatter and Word Spud seem more like just fun side games as opposed to main games.  The three mains games are Fibbage, Drawful, and You Don't Know Jack.  Fibbage is really fun, but after playing it for a while, I tend to see similar phrases repeated.  Drawful is similar, but with a wide variety of entertaining words to draw, meaning that it continues to be fun.  You Don't Know Jack is both hilarious and lots of fun, however, there are only 50 words.  I am not sure if Jackbox Games intends to continue updating the game, but the addition of more episodes of YDKJ and more Fibbage phrases would definitely make it a better experience.  What's cool about the game is that if you have Skype, or a program that allows you to share your screen, you can play with your friends online, without them having to purchase the game.  You can play Fibbage, Word Spud, and Drawful, (YDKJ and Lie Swatter need fast response time, and with input lag and screen share delay, it gives the people not in the room a large disadvantage) from great distances.  Even without screen sharing, you can play Word Spud and Fibbage, but the experience is a lot more fun with your friends next to you.  HOPEFULLY YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T BACKSTABBING NERDCHERDLERS WHO WON'T PLAY WITH YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE YOU MADE THEM PLAY IT FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES, IT WAS LIKE TWO GAMES OF FIBBAGE AND THEY WERE ALL 'nooo i don wan plae animorr' AND THEN SPENT THE NEXT 20 MINUTES ARGUING ABOT WHAT THEY DID WANT TO PLAY","January 3, 2015","true","186.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It turns a mobile webpage into a digital controller, with buzz-in and Screw buttons. And the 2015 version is great. For the most part, it all works well, but the Jack Attack is frustratingly reliant on a lack of lag and fractions-of-seconds difference in buzzing in, which drags the experience down a bit. Otherwise, it works great.\n\nAnd the other games included in here are surprisingly fun. Specifically, Word Spud and Fibbage are brilliant, making use of a phone's keyboard for clever input. They utilize creativity and reward it, and are  honestly just as much of a reason to buy this as YDKJ! Plus, they accomodate up to 8 players.\n\nThe games load quickly for each mobile user, and thankfully it's as easy as entering a 4-digit code in any mobile web browser.\n\nFun stuff for parties.\n\nP.S., for some reason the drawing game refused to work for us... I'll update this again if it decides to function. It looks fun.","January 26, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This team still has some of the funniest writing in games and the host is hilarious.\nFibbage my favorite so far -- up to EIGHT players, and because you're entering your own answers via your phone/tablet the game is as silly (or racy) as your imagination! Literally takes about 30 seconds to set up with your devices and has performed flawlessly for us in Fibbage.\nMy biggest disappointment is the lack of support for multiple controllers in You Don't Know Jack. My wife and I are very competitive YDKJ players, and the twich factor on many of the YDKJ games make the web browser controls a frequent source of contention as to who buzzed in first.\nPLEASE add multiple controller support, guys! Those of us who are into local multiplayer games often have multiple controllers, and while Fibbage is designed from the ground up with the web-based interface in mind, YDKJ screams for direct control!","January 19, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/draino/recommended/331670/","draino","Draino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/draino/","200 products in account","Fibbage and Drawful are the best party games you'll ever play, especially for a 5-8 person group. They're extremely accessible games (even the trivia/artistically challenged have a good shot at winning), as clean or dirty as the participants are willing to make them, and rounds move quickly so people at your party can rotate in and out as needed.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack 2015 is also a blast for groups of 2-4 (or by yourself)- the comedic writing has not gone downhill from the stellar 2011 entry in the series. Also the rules and question types have not changed significantly- if you liked that entry in the YDKJ series, you will also like this one.\n\nLie Swatter is a little underwhelming and I have yet to try Word Spud, but who cares, I can strongly recommend this game on the strength of those first three games alone. This game is an amazing value, especially compared to something like Mario Party where you're paying $50 for a game that at most 4 people can play and everyone needs a $40 controller. Here, because of the phones-as-controller thing, most people will have no problem finding enough devices for everyone to play.\n\nI was initially hesitant about the phones-as-controllers thing because I couldn't get the provided website to work in my Windows Phone browser, but after changing a phone setting (you have to turn off Data Sense), things started working as expected and I was sold on the idea. Nobody else I've played with had any problems out of the box with their iPhones using Safari or Androids using Chrome. If some people are on cellular networks and some people are on wi-fi, the difference in latency might be noticeable in YDKJ, but it's a nonissue in Fibbage/Drawful because everyone's got plenty of time and you're not competing to press a button first.\n\nThese games are not only very technically impressive (because of the phones thing), they are also very funny and a ♥♥♥♥ing blast at parties. Buy it.","March 28, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Drawful is the best thing in here and is arguably worth the full price alone: everyone laughing at both eachother's terrible drawings and terrible answers to the drawings. Fibbage was fun in the same ways the Drawful was, but just less of it I guess. Being able to play the game on any smartphone or tablet browser is an amazing idea, and a way better method than any pass-and-play party games I've played before.\n\nSadly the other two new games in this pack aren't very good. Word Spud is at least a good idea - an off-the-rails word association game in theory - but gets boring pretty fast and the whole everyone-gives-points-if-they-like-the-word kinda makes no sense being there in the end. Lie Swatter just isn't enough of a thing to stay interesting for long at all, though it's understandable it wouldn't be too involved or complicated if it can incorporate 100 players.\n\nThat said, I do think that this pack is absolutely worth it for Drawful, Fibbage and You Don't Know Jack. I think it goes without saying but this might not be a good purchase if you're not the kind of person who plays much local multiplayer, although I can totally see people putting this up on something like screen share in a skype call and playing like that. That'd work too.","December 25, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've supplied a mini-review of each game below as well as a remark on the bad multiplayer, because this is the kind of game that thrives on a party.\n\nYDKJ 2015 is more of what you love: a trivia game full of satire and rib-rubbing, with in-jokes and pop culture sprinkled healthily over top and a healthy dollop of the just plain bizzare.  It is somewhat of a Jeopardy for the MTV crowd, and is even split into individual 'episodes'.  Once you've played through all of the episodes, you'll start to repeat questions and the game loses some lustre, but that should not dissuade you, because You Don't Know Jack is famed for its writing and the snide side-remarks of its host.  You're definitely getting your money's worth with YDKJ alone. (9/10)\n\nFibbage is a game of lying to your friends.  A Jeopardy-like question is phrased, but with a missing word and its up to you and your friends to supply a word to fill the blank.  Once done, all the submissions are displayed with the TRUE answer, and its up to you to puzzle out which of the words is the truth, and which are your friends' submissions.  It's great fun, but can be ruined by the game not having sufficient duplication-detection.  This is a problem when someone typos a word, or adds "the" or "a" in front of a similar submission by someone else, which causes the game to display both (now obviously wrong) submissions, which makes it very easy to discern the truth.  Only a minor problem, because the game is still a blast despite this.  I've yet to play through all the questions, but my understanding is that there's not nearly enough.  That said, what's there should keep you reasonably occupied.  8/10\n\nDrawful is identical in nature to Fibbage, with the exception that instead of being shown a phrase and filling in a blank, you are instead asked to draw something.  It's easily the best game of the set, and art skill is not required.  In fact, the worse you are, the better it is.  Once you're done drawing, friends add a title to your artwork, and then try to guess the "true" title from the list of submissions.  The game is incredibly sneaky, and will even misspell some of the "true" titles in an attempt to make them appear to be user-submitted.  It's great fun, but loses points for not having any kind of erase function (a big problem when your are tapping your phone to keep it awake during the game).  It's easily the most fun I've had with this whole pack so far though, and still earns top marks despite (or because of) people instantly resorting to drawing ♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  9/10\n\nWordSpud is a stream-of-conciousness typing game.  A word is displayed, and its up to you to complete a phrase using that word.  The end word of your phrase then becomes the beginning word for the next player, and so on.  Players yea/nay each submission, and the number of yeas/nays are given as points.  This is where the game falls apart, because it relys on charity.  It's easy to simply "nay" each submission and subtract points from your friends.  There's no objective scoring, and each game devolves accordingly. 5/10\n\nLie Swatter is a game to bust out if you've got a real bone-fide party going on.  Anyone can join a game in progress, and the game supports up to 100 players.  The game displays a statement, and its up to everyone playing to buzz in whether its Truth or False.  Some good trivia to be found here, but the game lacks personality.  The game is really You Don't Know Jack "Lite", with all the weird questions but with none of the charm or satire of YDKJ's over-the-top host.  6/10\n\n__________\n\nThis is all well and good, but there is a crucial flaw in every single one of these games:  The Jackbox does *NOT* support local multiplayer, *NOR* does it support online multiplayer.  Instead, it horribly butchers both.\n\nLet me explain: The Jackbox has controller support, but only for single player.  If you have 2 or more players (and you should, because its a f---ing "party pack") then you *must* connect through "Jackbox.TV", a website set up specifically for this purpose.  Players use their phones, tablets, or laptops and navigate to the site, enter a 4-character code and join the game.  Each player is controls the game by typing, drawing, or tapping the virtual buttons on their device.  In theory, this is great.  In practice Jackbox.TV requires a relatively new smartphone.  If you're using Windows Phone, Blackberry, or an Android device older than 4.X, or an older i-Device, you're ♥♥♥♥-outta-luck.  This is a total bummer for a game that purports to be able to be played "on your phone or tablet".  Even on a laptop, IE is not supported and you must use Chrome or FF.\n\nThis ruins the fun by a significant margin.  You'd think that if someone's phone is incompatible that you could use one of those controllers sitting around, but the Jackbox bizarrely removes support for controllers in multiplayer.  It's a crippling blow to a great game.  If you have multiple controllers, a keyboard, and multiple mobile devices, each should be able to connect and play, but instead only mobile is supported for multiplayer, and even then only mobile devices meeting the very specific criteria of being able to support WebSockets (there's a website to check if your browser supports websockets).\n\nYou Don't Know Jack is very time-sensitive, and it's frustrating if your mobile data ends up being fractionally slower than someone elses'.  Again, something that controllers have solved years ago, but someone at Jackbox Games thinks that you only own one controller.\n\nDo your research.  The Jackbox still gets a "yes" from me but honestly it's a close one.  The "phones-only" multiplayer really cripples this otherwise great pack of games.  It could easily benefit from having a free app that provided better support for phones that don't have WebSocket-capable browsers, or by supporting controllers and the keyboard in local multiplayer.","January 11, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I originally looked into Fibbage due to an Achievement Hunter Let's Play and I soon learned that the pack comes with 5 games.\n\nFibbage: Love everything about this game, though it really needs more questions.\nDrawful: Just as good as fibbage and honestly probably even funnier with the right group of friends.  Lots of content.\nWord Spud:  Pretty fun, but it is best played with like minded people.\nYou don't know Jack: I liked it, but I haven't played it more than twice.\nLie Swatter: Thought it was pretty boring, friends no longer want to play this after playing it once.\n\nOkay so how do you play this game online?  I started with twitch but the delay was enormous.  Then I tried Hitbox and Steam Broadcast.. About a 4-5 second delay on each so not the worst but still pretty bad when you should all be seeing the screen at the same time.  So what should you use?  Simple, all you need is a screensharing program.  I use a program called Teamviewer which is free, extremely easy to use and easy to set up.  I've had about 15 people download this to play no problem.  I've heard Skype screenshare might also work but I haven't tried it.  I've had nothing but poor experiences with Skpye so I can't be bothered to try it anyways.\n\nMy process: First off I gather up the people I'm playing with in Teamspeak (Mumble/Skype/Steam Voice Chat/etc also work), it's usually just whoever is there and then we'll try to get a few more in, prefarably 8.  Next I open up Teamviewer and start a presentation, making sure I have my performance meter set as high as it will go.  I am then given a code to give to everyone that they put into the Teamviewer app and they instantly join my presentation no problem.  I give them all some time to look at my cute wallpapers while I wait for everyone to join of course.  When everyone is in I open up the game in windowed mode and display it on my second monitor.  You CAN do this with one monitor but then either your display will be really small for everyone or you will have to write down your answers via phone/tablet.  I click on the preview settings on my Teamviewer and have it display ONLY the game on the second monitor, then my primary monitor is open for answer input/whatever else you want.  Start the lobby, have everyone join Jackbox.tv, make sure they can see both your screen on Teamviewer and their input device (we all use the web browser) and you're ready to go.\n\nThe problems with my method:  I have been disconnected from team viewer one time in the 8 hours I've played this game with everyone and had to have everyone join a new presentation.  Also there is VERY NOTICABLE FPS lag and it can look very bad, but everyone agrees it is completely playable since there is no delay.  I would not reccomend this method for anything other than playing party games.  By the way, only one person needs to buy this game, everyone else just watches the Teamviewer/web input device.\n\nI just thought I'd post this so those looking for a game to play with their online friends can have an easy time figuring out how to set this us.  As ridiculous as my workaround is, it's completely manageable and after doing it a few times it only takes me about a minute to set everything up.  This game is awesome and I hope they add online multiplayer, but until then this works.\n\nGood luck, have fun :D","January 12, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the first gathering, we tried Drawful for about 5-10 minutes before giving up, because it turns out that while we were on a reasonably servicable internet connection it wasn't good enough. Luckily, when I tried it and Fibbage out with family we had a more stable connection and everything worked a lot better; both Fibbage and Drawful were fantastic fun. This makes it even more disappointing that there's no offline mode; I don't know about console ports, but on the PC you should be able to set up a small webserver running the same site as jackbox.tv to provide a LAN version.\n\nOn the whole, I would recommend this game only to those with good (not even just OK!) internet connections.","May 9, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had a lot of fun along with my family, and I'm sure that I will play it again in the future with friends. Just make sure that everyone has a device that will be able to connect to jackbox.tv (e.g. tablets, phones, laptops, etc.) as it will act as their controller to all of the games within the pack! (Being able to put the game on a big-screen (e.g. AirPlay to an Apple TV) is also handy, although you can all just cramp around a computer in your office...)\n\nBy far my favourite game within the pack, as there are 5 games inside, was Fibbage XL. Basically, everyone would input a lie as an answer to the question on-screen, the lies would be shuffled in with the correct answer, and then everyone would have to choose which answer they thought was the right one. Fool someone and you'll get points. Find the truth and you'll get even more points! There is a lot of fun to be had with it!\n\nNext I would say Drawful was also very enjoyable. It has a very similar concept to Fibbage, only you have to draw a picture of something and then people have to guess what it is. Their guesses are shuffled in with the correct answer, and, just as in Fibbage, you get points for fooling people or guessing what the picture actually is.\n\nYDKJ 2015 was also quite a bit of fun, but as I only played it with my family (of whom there are a few kids) it didn't last long. Yes, the trivia aspect was fun, but there were some more mature questions that left our six year old quite puzzled and us embarrassed... But aside from that, Lie Swatter and Word Spud really aren't that great. Lie Swatter is decent, in that you have to guess if the statement on the screen is T/F, but Word Spud's scoring system is broken. I say this because the other players get to vote on whether your word is good or not, and so someone can rig the system.\n\nOverall, as I said in the opening of this review, this game is a must-have for people who want to entertain their guests or friends (or even family). You are bound to have hours of laughs with Fibbage, Drawful, and YDKJ 2015. And the best part is that everyone's controllers are their phones!\n\n(Note: the game requires you to be connected to the Jackbox servers in order to play, which is a drawback for people wanting to play without internet)\n\nEnjoy! :D","May 9, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is hilarious, entertaining, and an experience heavily influenced by the people playing it.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you have people you can play it with - but that's not hard to do. All you really need is an internet connection, and if you use skype screen-sharing or something, you and your friends don't even have to be in the same room. It's a perfect game for parties, as long as the 8-player limit on two of the best games isn't a problem.\n\nI very occasionally have trouble with the connection - for example, in a round of Fibbage someone's phone won't display the answer choices, and they end up not being able to answer the question. It's not a common occurance, and usually resolves itself when we move on to the next question or refresh the page. It's never really been that big of a deal, but it might be worth mentioning that it's not flawless.\n\nOverall, great game.

The main game takes place on your computer screen and players use phones, tablets or anything with a compatible browser to interact with the questions. The games range from a standard trivia game (with a You Don't Know Jack twist), a truth or lie game (Lie Swatter) a fill in the blank game (where you have to fool your friends and find the truth) and a few more.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, with the usual quirky You Don't Know Jack charm. Definitely worth a purchase, especially with some games allowing upto 100 players.","June 21, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's only two real problems, One is two of the games aren't that good, but the other 3, You Don't Know Jack, Fibbage, and Drawful definitly make up for it. The other is the replay value is a little bit on the low side, but I've got 14 hours as of now out of it and will definitly get a lot more. Honestly, one thing I'd reccomend though is if you are torn between this game and Jackbox party pack 2, definitly get 2.

For You Don't Know Jack 2015, is that most of the material is topical to that time.

Using your phones (or a tablet) as a controller works seamlessly.\n\nI love that no one had to download an app for their phone in order to play.  They just set their smart phone browser to jackbox.tv and entered in the code the game told them to enter.  Viola they were logged into the game and ready to go!\n\nMy favorite was Fibbage, where you and your friends tried to BS your way to points.  Lie Swatter was also pretty fun and allows the most people to play at once.\n\nAll the games are pretty quick, so it is easy to keep everyone's attention.  This party pack will definitely be played again.\n\nOnly con I have is that the You Don't Know Jack game only allows up to 4 players where all the others allow at least up to 8 (one even up to 100).

I only tried it for a few minutes on my own after purchasing it but when my guests came over that night was my first time trying the different games and the multiplayer. I was a little worried about everything working but after giving everyone access to my router ( I was trying to avoid it before) it worked fine. The games are fast and fun, Fibbage, Drawful and Word Spud were the most popular ( in that order). We tried all but stuck to the games that supported 8 players since I had about 15 people with me and the game connected to my 92 inch projected screen, it worked out perfect. I can't believe how much everyone enjoyed it, we were supposed to watch a movie after playing this for an hour but we ended up playing the entire night until 4am, (6 hours total) .\nYou might not think of games for a fun time at a house party but it makes sense when it supports a lot of people.\nAs much as I enjoyed this game it could be soooooo much better if they can increase the player limit for some games like Word Spud. Also Controller support for multiplayer should be implemented, it should be simple enough.\nI also liked the jokes the commentary helped things feel really "legit".\nI definitely recommend this game for a party.","May 25, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's only fun with 4 or more people. 3 or less it gets kinda dull. Yeah some games can be played with 2 but really it's just not that great.\n2. You will find yourself playing Fibbage and Drawful more than any of the others. You don't know jack is good, and so isn't lie swatter but they seem to repeat the same questions a lot. Word spud sounds great but you have to rely on everyone else voting yes on your answer which can be a game breaker for really compatitive players.\n3.

I do NOT recommend this game if you are not going to play it with people locally. Nearly everything in this pack is meant for playing with friends and family in person--not online. There is no online multiplayer for this title, and there is not enough here for a single player experience.\n\nNow, this first Jackbox Party Pack is kind of an amazing value proposition if you play with friends with any level of consistency. Usually a board game will run you around $20 and a few play throughs of that one game. This is around that price but offers many more games to play and is something nearly anyone can get into.\n\nAlso, all of these games run off the browser of a supported mobile device, and you can't really play otherwise.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack is played with 1-4 players and is a wacky trivia game that is insanely fun to play. The game is seperated into the actual trivia and a buzz in section that can lead to great times, along with accusations of unfairness due to taps on the phones and tablets. This is a great game to play after you've played another game, it's not so great as a "warm-up" title.\n\nFibbage, on the other hand, with 2-8 players is a game that is great as a warm up title or actual game. Lying to friends and family is always fun, but this game gives you the chance to actually win for it! It's a weird combination of trivia, and a lying game. Pretty much everyone I know loves this game, while they may dislike most of the other games in the pack.\n\nDrawful is one of those games that sounds amazing on paper, but in its implementation could use a ton of work. You and your fellow players are given a word, and are then expected to draw whatever that is. However, the word or phrase could be "midget santa claus", which, is awfully hard to draw on a mobile device. Not being able to erase further makes the game frustrating to play, and with some phones or tablets not scaling properly can lead to a very tiny space for actually drawing. That being said, this is one of the games in the pack that I nearly always end up playing due to the second portion of the game which is titling the picture, and then picking the correct title from a pool of choices. This game is a blast to play--so long as you're given reasonable phrases or words to draw.\n\nWord Spud is a game that has left me scratching my head in its design and inculsion in the pack. The game starts with a word, like "the" and you are tasked with writing words after it, which your friends then vote on. That's it. The person with the most points by the end of the game wins, and that's that. You can make the game more interesting by creating a topic like "poltics" and voting based on how close they are to the theme, but that kind of funcionality isn't present by default. It's definitely the second weakest game in the pack.\n\nLie Swatter is a game that was obviously meant for a streaming service like twitch and not a game that's meant for a few people. You're given facts, and vote on 'em. The one with the most points wins. Sometimes this game is a blast, but most of the times I've played it it's been pretty boring for everyone involved. There is a ton of variety in the questions though, so it has a decent amount of replayability.\n\nAll of this said, the Jackbox Party Pack is an amazing game for a smallish group of friends to dig into in person. If you're looking for a game to play with more than 8 people though, you're out of luck.","December 27, 2015","true","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a long time fan of the YDKJ series, i highly recomend.\n\nPros:\n-Great new content for the classic You Don't Know Jack game.\n-Fun new Fibbage game really brings more wackiness to the table.\n-Drawful. Like, this game doesn't need an explination. Just play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this.\n\nCons:\n-Some wifi issues when playing with more than a couple players. Could just be my own modem, but with everyone using cell phones or tablets to play the multiplayer we've had issues with players getting droped or their answers not going in on time.\n-Lie Swatter and the other game lack in terms of fun and replayibility. They're worth a couple of runs but are very easy to forget. The three main games make up for these easily enough.\n\n--\nOverall the OG party pack is really where it's at if you've played the old YDKJ or are bored with the newest installment already.

While i'm sure I will eventually run out of new material, as long as you dont play it THAT often, you will probably forget a lot of the right answers for some of the catagories. This also usually isnt the problem for the drawing game, since it can be ANYTHING, and if these guys have been playing with you, it makes it all the more harder to fool them.\n\nI will say, Lie swatters only purpose is how many players it can handle.

I do NOT recommend this game if you are not going to play it with people locally. Nearly everything in this pack is meant for playing with friends and family in person--not online. There is no online multiplayer for this title, and there is not enough here for a single player experience.\n\nNow, this first Jackbox Party Pack is kind of an amazing value proposition if you play with friends with any level of consistency. Usually a board game will run you around $20 and a few play throughs of that one game. This is around that price but offers many more games to play and is something nearly anyone can get into.\n\nAlso, all of these games run off the browser of a supported mobile device, and you can't really play otherwise.\n\nYou Don't Know Jack is played with 1-4 players and is a wacky trivia game that is insanely fun to play. The game is seperated into the actual trivia and a buzz in section that can lead to great times, along with accusations of unfairness due to taps on the phones and tablets. This is a great game to play after you've played another game, it's not so great as a "warm-up" title.\n\nFibbage, on the other hand, with 2-8 players is a game that is great as a warm up title or actual game. Lying to friends and family is always fun, but this game gives you the chance to actually win for it! It's a weird combination of trivia, and a lying game. Pretty much everyone I know loves this game, while they may dislike most of the other games in the pack.\n\nDrawful is one of those games that sounds amazing on paper, but in its implementation could use a ton of work. You and your fellow players are given a word, and are then expected to draw whatever that is. However, the word or phrase could be "midget santa claus", which, is awfully hard to draw on a mobile device. Not being able to erase further makes the game frustrating to play, and with some phones or tablets not scaling properly can lead to a very tiny space for actually drawing. That being said, this is one of the games in the pack that I nearly always end up playing due to the second portion of the game which is titling the picture, and then picking the correct title from a pool of choices. This game is a blast to play--so long as you're given reasonable phrases or words to draw.\n\nWord Spud is a game that has left me scratching my head in its design and inculsion in the pack. The game starts with a word, like "the" and you are tasked with writing words after it, which your friends then vote on. That's it. The person with the most points by the end of the game wins, and that's that. You can make the game more interesting by creating a topic like "poltics" and voting based on how close they are to the theme, but that kind of funcionality isn't present by default. It's definitely the second weakest game in the pack.\n\nLie Swatter is a game that was obviously meant for a streaming service like twitch and not a game that's meant for a few people. You're given facts, and vote on 'em. The one with the most points wins. Sometimes this game is a blast, but most of the times I've played it it's been pretty boring for everyone involved. There is a ton of variety in the questions though, so it has a decent amount of replayability.\n\nAll of this said, the Jackbox Party Pack is an amazing game for a smallish group of friends to dig into in person. If you're looking for a game to play with more than 8 people though, you're out of luck.","December 27, 2015","true","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a long time fan of the YDKJ series, i highly recomend.\n\nPros:\n-Great new content for the classic You Don't Know Jack game.\n-Fun new Fibbage game really brings more wackiness to the table.\n-Drawful. Like, this game doesn't need an explination. Just play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this.\n\nCons:\n-Some wifi issues when playing with more than a couple players. Could just be my own modem, but with everyone using cell phones or tablets to play the multiplayer we've had issues with players getting droped or their answers not going in on time.\n-Lie Swatter and the other game lack in terms of fun and replayibility. They're worth a couple of runs but are very easy to forget. The three main games make up for these easily enough.\n\n--\nOverall the OG party pack is really where it's at if you've played the old YDKJ or are bored with the newest installment already.

I often play with my family during get togethers. Drawful is silly and so much fun. The inability to erase or change colors makes for a fun challenge when you get asked to draw things like "Cyclops Picnic" or "Purple". YDKJ is as fun as ever, testing your knowledge of the random and ridiculous facts. Fibbage brings the fun of Drawful without the need to draw, and is always a crowd pleaser.\n\nGreat set of games, fun for everyone.","March 8","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My friends and I use Skype's screensharing function to play in real time. The only thing you lose is the sound but it's fine since everyone will be chatting. Playing locally is fine; we just hook up the laptop to a nearby tv for the best experience.\n\nBest games are Fibbage, Drawful and You Don't Know Jack! Fibbage is a great game to play even if you're not a trivia buff since it also relies on your bluffing skills.  Non-artists don't have to worry about having great drawing skills in Drawful, since the concepts are way more complex than your average Pictionary words. The end results are hilarious though. You Don't Know Jack is your typical 4 player trivia type game.\n\nAs for the other two, Word Spud would be best enjoyed by people who love word puzzles/games. Lie Swatter is the least fun in my opinion since you're basically playing "true or false".","November 29, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
