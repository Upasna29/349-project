So, complains about the "unrealistic physics" are just stupidity. It's like complaining that Mario Kart is not realistic!\n2nd, the game is too short. Now, it is true that there are too few tracks and too few cars, but the game actually runs very well with no bugs at all and it is actually fun for some fast destruction racing with friends.\nAnd 3rd, the graphics are not top quality. But in my opinion, they are good enough. (Actually, I just can't understand why people give so much importance to graphics on games. Fabulous graphics may impress you at first, but after some minutes you get used to it and your entertainment will actually rely much more on other aspects, not on the graphics, unless it's so bad that it hampers gameplay, which is rare and definitely not the case here)\nThough there are better titles out there, it's 44 metascore is simply absurd. This is not the first time I see a totally misleading metascore. I can't trust it anymore after this one.","November 25, 2013","true","2.3"," 153 of 177 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","153","177","0","5"

The goal here is to get the most kills while on a closed circuit track rather than winning a race. A simple make it to the finish line would be too easy. Since you want the most kills, if you're in first place you had best slow down and let the others catch up to you so you can wreck them. However, then you risk them overtaking you and the person in front always has the advantage when only one weapon is designed for a forward attack.\n\nEach of the game's twelve vehicles has their own set of three weapons. The front attack is usually something that shoots forward, the side attack sprays out mines of some sort and the back attack drops something. These weapons all do something slightly different. The childhood dreams school bus has a cow catcher that will throw a vehicle, the alchemist RV has an ooze gun. The logger has side saw blades, while another vehicle has mines that will throw you into reverse. The side and back attacks are temporary and disappear after a moment. When you use them a rear view camera appears so you can see if anyone hits them for your own fiendish glee. When you kill someone a notice pops up on the screen.\n\nYou can have all three of your weapons ready by driving through colored barrels. Blue is the side weapon, yellow is the front, red is the rear. Black barrels give you a random charge. Having three weapons at once makes you dangerous. In fact everyone here is dangerous. You need to watch your opponents for a red, blue or yellow glow on on each respective area. Well if there's a glow on their front you'll never see it coming. There is full camera control, but the problem is you need to rotate the camera to face behind you rather than a quick look behind you. Another shame is no indicator to warn you that someone is on your six.\n\nTo get into the lead position you have a nitro boost and a lot of it. If you run out, you can find more in green barrels, but otherwise it refills after a brief moment. This boost is more than a slow thrust, so there's no logic to using it. When you get a small amount of it, use it.\n\nYour vehicle has health, so getting hit with a falling log or running over ice spikes still gives you a chance of surviving. If you die, wreck or even respawn, you lose all of your charged weapons and keep what's left of your used nitro. So Post Apocalyptic Mayhem has good strategy rather than quick and crazy car combat.\n\nThe courses are designed to make use of this combat with several sections that break up a map into narrow stalls, larger areas and bottlenecks. Kills are almost guaranteed without quick thinking to play defensive and let others through a narrow corridor or nitro ahead and leave barrels or fire for the others to run through. There are several different paths with each track so you always have a chance of finding a safe path to get ahead.\n\nThere's an arcade mode that lets you play one track at a time, but I much prefer the apocalyptic challenge which has you playing all eight tracks back to back with a score after each one and a final score at the conclusion. This mode makes it feel like a deeper game even if its limited. The game does offer multiplayer online with ranked matches, but four years after a budget title's release means the game is inevitably dead for multiplayer. I would have enjoyed it, because medium felt easy and the hard difficulty while it was still fun, it was difficult to exceed second to last place.\n\nThe vehicles all have character and there's a wide variety each with their own stats for acceleration handling and mayhem.  You have nine unlocked from the start and can select between a pair of dune buggies, a little car with a unicorn head that has a giant twisting drill, another small nuclear themed car and a few others. You'll need to purchase DLC with the ice cream truck, 1950s squad car and classic tow truck. On sale, I'd go for it. I'd advise against smaller vehicles, because a smaller body size means its tougher to hit the barrels to get weapon charges.\n\nIf you think there's a balance to smaller vehicles having less body to hit with weapons, you'd be wrong, because the weapons really scatter out making them tough to avoid without stopping. The mines themselves are tiny and blinking, so they're tough to even see.\n\nThe game plays like a lot of other racers with a chase cam and I feel like the game was really designed with a 360 controller in mind. Everything is color coated to the controller, even the barrels. Its true arcade style racing with throttle controls of forward and reverse. There is a hard brake, even if I never had to brake. Slowing down to let opponents catch up just meant I had to let off the forward.\n\nNow that I've discussed the good, let's turn to the bad. The weight of each vehicle is so light it felt like driving a balloon with tires. Its difficult to stay grounded even in a logging rig, a school bus or an RV. There are a lot of jumps and ramps, but I'm talking about in general you can be driving on the walls. Coming down from a high jump can bounce you back up. Its ridiculous and it took me thirty minutes before I stopped laughing at the game and had some fun with it. You can also boost through the air, because your boost is a rocket rather than strict nitrous.\n\nAs for the graphics and art direction, it just looks faded and worn. I feel like I could enjoy the game more if the colors were bolder and it was more than a dusty covered look to them. I would say a dusty brown, but one of the eight courses feels little more than a happy winter wonderland of a previous course where rather than having brown sand blowing in the breeze its a snow dusting.\n\nAnother interesting thing is how much the demo or trailer plays in game if you wait too long in the menu. I enjoy when games have demos or trailers and it seems to be what's missing from games now, but it plays a little too often.\n\nThere's a lot working against the game despite all its positives. Its still far from a good game, but it was entertaining once I stopped laughing at it and found the strategy involved. In a sequel I would love more levels, more modes and a different, more vibrant art direction. I think a lot of people will hate it for how simplistic the weapons are with side, front and back coupled with the fact each vehicle's weapons are different and there are better vehicles.\n\nIf you find it on sale, take a risk.","September 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a racing game, except honestly the racing doesn't matter. What really counts is the level of destruction you cause on the other drivers while racing.\n\nThe game comes with a variety of cars (ranging from an ice cream truck, police car, and more cynically, a mobile meth lab) that all play differently.  Each car gets three weapons, which are activated by finding colored barrels.\n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward.  Literally.  You just drive down the track, collect weapons, and make it hell for the other drivers.  If you can wreck another car, you get a point.\n\nMy big complaint about this is the DLC pack.  The additional vehicles are included in the game already as opponents, the DLC simply unlocks them as playable.  It is not particularly expensive, but it strikes me as somehow a part of the full game is removed and hidden behind a paywall.","December 3, 2014","true","12.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I am completely in awe of this game and I am so addicted to it. I love how the races always seem different even though I may use the same car with their own unique weapons. Every race is so unpredictable and you never know what's going to happen. This is a good distraction game for me and it makes me feel incredibly happy playing it. I can kill my opponents without the risk of getting arrested! Lol. Great music tracks to each race in the apocalyptic challenge mode as well as various cars with extremely powerful weapons. Some cars are better than others but I like to play with them all to make it even and challenge myself even more. You can play on easy which is not as easy as you would imagine but a good place to start if you are playing it for the first time. I like playing on hard. I love the challenges of the hard mode. What can I say. Good graphics, music, gameplay and interest. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in buying it. If you like fun and a challenge or 2, then this game is for you. You need to be on the ball and kill your opponents in order to get the most kills if that's what you like. There is no escape! I would say that it's sometimes difficult to play in multiplayer if you can't get any players to join but it's a good excuse to get your friends to buy it too!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/recommended/91900/","maghook","Maghook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/","1308 products in account","Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a fun, arcade-type racing game where the goal is to destroy as many opponents as possible with a variety of weapon pick-ups. There are no laps and your position in the race does not matter, there is only a countdown timer that signifies the end of the match. Unfortunately, that simple description is where the fun ends.\n\nThe game is broken. Some vehicles are obviously better than the others and the ones that are lacking in certain areas are not awarded any compensation in the remaining aspects as you would come to expect. A vehicle that is extremely slow generally does not gain a weapon that can be used over distance, rather requiring you to home in on your enemy before launching an assault from the front, side, or rear. Vehicles faster than you can manage to "hoard" all of the pick-ups, leaving you with the frustrating realisation that you are crippled and unequal.\n\nFast vehicles have the advantage, even if they have horrible steering. Certain faster vehicles in particular have weapons that create an area-of-effect that can wipe out every opponent in a single attack. Unless you like the challenge it is simply unwise to select a vehicle that is slow and cumbersome.\n\nIn my short experience I've come to understand that the online matchmaking system and netcode is completely broken. There is no way to cancel a connecting session, you are simply forced to sit and stare at what might be a match being made or what might turn out to be a failed connection. Once you've successfully joined a game you might find yourself stuck in starting position, like stone, as you watch other opponents speed off only to look to the side and see another half-dozen opponents frozen in the same position as you. There is nothing you can do, the only course of action here is to force-close the game by using the task manager or through Alt+F4.\n\nI've also now discovered that if you check someone's "gamercard" while you're waiting for the match to start you will not be able to close the Steam overlay as it will continue opening the person's Steam profile over and over again. The only way to successfully stop this is to wait for the match to begin and close the overlay or simply force the game to close through the task manager, as the overlay prevents Alt+F4 from working most of the time. This is a massive oversight on behalf of the developer and who knows if bugs such as these will ever be fixed.","February 13, 2014","false","9.4"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","27","45","0","0"

The reason for this seems simply to be because the developers disassociated themselves from the Meridian 4 group for a period of time. Even during the absence of this game on the store page, the PAM community was still playing it, with their friends quite frequently.\n\nYou will also notice that this game has what seems quite an absurd meta critic review score 44/100 when you compare it to the large amount of positive reviews from the gamers themselves. One of the biggest complaints to the game is that it has relatively few levels 7 all up and a handful of cars 12 only which some are quite decent.\n\nThe game is best described as a Mad Max version of Mario Kart. The objective is to not only be the fastest around the track, but also the one who has the most kills. Hence it is possible to win the game even coming in third place or something as long as those in first and second place do not have more kills than you.\n\nTo help you get the kills each car is fitted with a wide arrange of novelty weapons which only activate by running over the corresponding colored barrels on the race track. Each car has a weapon that shoots from the side of the car, shoots behind the car and shoots in front of the car, there is also a turbo boost you can pick up. Each directional weapon is color coded to a corresponding barrel color. While this may sound complicated you will pick up the idea within the first lap.\n\nThe cars handle really well and the map courses are quite eye pleasing and somewhat versatile when it comes to terrain. When the game suggests mayhem it aint kidding. On the harder difficulties you will spend most of your time bouncing around the screen by all the explosions thanks to your enemies. The game caters single player, multiplayer and campaign.\n\nIt must also be noted that there is a large amount of achievements that are dedicated to the multiplayer aspects of this game, the frustrating thing is that there are few that play the multiplayer online, unless they are playing with friends. So if your an achievement hunter you may wish to seriously think about buying the multiple pack of this game so that you can play it with your friends. This game is definitely fun and really quite decent, having said that I would still recommend that you wait for it to go on a sale.\n\nSince the game was developed back in 2011, hopefully steel mokeys will one day stop scrathing and sniffing their behinds and give us more levels and dlc to please the players. There is serious potential here, but alas still only peanuts of material given.","September 16, 2015","true","9.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

This is accomplished by grabbing weapons off the track. Players can equip weapons for the front, sides, and rear. There's also a boost for catching up to the...mayhem. With a multitude of tracks and a variety of cars to drive, this game gets a pass in terms of content.\n\nIn practice though...ehhh...hmmm..oh uh well shoot. There's really no incentive for actually trying to race. The winner is determined solely by # of kills. At this point, why not just have a big arena? Make it a car combat game like the Twisted Metal series. Actually that wouldn't work because most of the weapons are designed for a racing game. It's a head-scratcher of the a design-decision, since it applies to the entirety of the single-player. There is a multiplayer mode for racing, but everyone is going to destroy each other anyway(or at least they would if anyone played this game online).\n\nAll that said, it isn't really a big deal. I'm just annoyed as hell because while playing the game I got hit with a nasty bug. At one point the game gets stuck on a loading screen. It stinks but it happens.

It allows you to play multiplayer and singleplayer. Game is created to have some fun with your friends in multiplayer. In game you to race and destroy opponents. Singleplayer player is a bit boring because you play vesrus computer. In multiplayer you can choose your vehicle and while racing you can pick items on the ground and with them you can destroy opponents.\n\nGame is worth of money. I reccommed this game to racer gamers and everyone who wanna have some fun with friends while playing co-op or multiplayer.\n8,5/10","February 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Multiplayer matches are rare but totally worth it when you manage to assemble a couple of drivers for a match.\n\nGame is often bundled and sold very cheaply but do not think for a moment that this is some garbage bin game.  Game has been designed with thought and this can be seen in the strategical thinking that is required to succeed rather than absolute skill in driving laps as fast as possible. In fact you will not win if you keep trying to speed away from the others. Kills count and they can be tough to get.\n\nNot going to spill much ink here on mechanics. other reviews has explained this very well already in deep detail. Let's just say there are vehicles for everyone and yes there are some vehicles that are more deadly than others in the hands of people who know how to use them but no car is really OP once you learn how to deal with them.\n\nGet this game and play it.","November 30, 2015","true","15.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Especially with friends, if you don't mind not so great graphics but gaming is just for fun to you this game is great to play once in a while. Don't play it too much then it becomes a bit boring due to how small that the game is. Few cars few maps but I still recommend it because it's really fun.","August 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is not about racing. It's about war!\n\nThis one was once a small little gem, that was sadly overlooked and suffered from race quitters in it's multiplayer times. The game looks nice with a cool aesthetic and a good driving feeling. On release there were only three maps available which were fun to play. Thank to the devs a free DLC was released adding new content like two new maps and three new cars. The cars are well balanced starting from small fast ones to big slower ones. All cars have a front, side and a back attack. Every car has its unique crazy weapons which are activated by collecting power-up barrels on the race track. All weapons are fun and you should definitely try out all the cars with their weapons to better choose what car is best for you.\nIf this game is on a sale grab it! You won't regret it. Even if mulitplayer is dead now you will enjoy the single player long enough.","November 26, 2015","true","99.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has a Rock N Roll racing, arcade style feel because you have to pick up weapons from the track and the focus is on competing for those powerups and killing your opponents. However, its not a racing game. First place is measured by kills, so pulling ahead of your opponents where its difficult to damage them, actually results in a loss. The game needs some balance between racing and being a meat grinder, otherwise theres no reason to follow a course at all, just make it thunderdome.","December 2, 2013","true","4.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I saw this little gem and assumed it would fall into that category; I was wrong. PAM has a superb soundtrack for the type of game it is combined with chaotic multiplayer fun at an affordable price. However, if you don't have any friends to play with, I'd say pass.","November 29, 2014","true","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
