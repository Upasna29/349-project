On the other hand, it's brutally tough, it's unfair, and its quests suck hard. So even though I recommend it, I only recommend it to those who like extreme challenge.\n\nI love the idea behind Majesty, and I'm very sad that its levels were designed by masochists who have no idea what difficulty means. I like tough games, but they need to play fair. Majesty doesn't. Majesty enjoys sending hordes of tough enemies at you 30 seconds after mission start. Majesty enjoys directly targetting creatures at your certain structure (which of course must not be destroyed), even though you don't have a direct control over your heroes and the only thing you can do is rely on your luck or save/load approach. Have you ever seen eagles primarily attacking buildings? Well, in Majesty you will.\n\nThe overall problem is that even though you are not given a direct control over your heroes (which is absolutely great and I love it), the developers do not make the rest of the world consistent with this "simulation" approach. So, although some creatures just wander around, there are waves which doesn't and it doesn't make any sense, except for artificial difficulty.\n\nIf you want to finish this game, essential is\na) carefully reading a manual, or some web guides, because a lot of important features is not properly explained in-game\nb) slowing down time whenever there is a fight ('<' and '>' shortcuts)\nc) saving a lot, unless you want to repeat the whole level\n\nEven if you all of that, you'll need to repeat some expert levels at least once, because you'll need to learn what special events happen when (e.g. at the beginning of the third day, there is a wave of dragons targetting your elven lounge). And some levels have just one or two possible solutions and it's almost impossible to complete the level otherwise. You'll need to look at YouTube to see how to complete it. There's no other way.\n\nIt would be really great to have a Majesty-like game with a reasonable and enjoyable level design. Unfortunatelly, it hasn't happened yet.","November 13, 2014","true","0.2"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","42","53","3","2"

You can construct buildings, anything from guilds, to guard towers, to marketplaces.\n\nFrom the guilds you can recruit heroes, but they have a mind of their own, so to get them to do what you want you can place bounties to explore parts of the map or to kill and destroy enemies and buildings.\n\nHeroes will level up, and will buy things from the marketplace and other such buildings using gold they get from bounties, killing enemies, or finding in chests on the map.\n\nYou can level up buildings to improve them and to be able to research new things, such as better armor for your heroes to purchase at the blacksmith, or new spells for your wizards to learn at libraries.\n\nOverall Majesty is an interesting rts, which Majesty 2 couldn't quite live up to.","September 20, 2011","true","4.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

If you're a casual strategy player who doesn't want to control every single unit or gather resources manually then this game is for you.\n\nMajesty is mostly focused on which buildings you make, especially during the start of a level. The heroes will explore  the map on their own. They fight and gather items, and if the enemy they're facing is too strong they flee. They also upgrade their armor and weapons automatically but only if you build a blacksmith and research the upgrades. That means you don't have to worry about anything except making the right buildings. If you feel like ordering the units to search a specific location on the map you can add a bounty flag which will make the units move there to get the reward.\n\nBy the way, the music and voice acting is amazing.","December 8, 2015","true","26.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

But it's still a great game.\n\nFor those on Windows 10: Add -useddblit -blitmovietobackground to the launch options of your game or your game will slow down extremely badly after just a few buildings.  This doesn't completely solve it though, because it only lets you add a few more buildings and population before the slowdown begins again.  So instead of being at slowest speed after 10 buildings, the game will be at medium speed after about 25 buildings and each guild full.","November 30, 2013","true","10.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

It's a fair title as it's a bit of it's own beast. It has city/kingdom management. There are monsters - and heroes, which you hire, to deal with them.\n\nThe thing is, you don't control the heroes. You entice them. With bounties. It sounds a bit obtuse, but it's actually quite enjoyable. It's a constant balancing act of upgrading structures, researching technologies, and bribing heroes with ever greater sums of cash - which they then spend and you re-absorb through tax collectors.\n\nThere's a good deal of inventiveness in the game - and quite a bit of, essentially, altered perspectives. The situations are familiar to strategy players, but the approach is novel.\n\nKeep in mind that it's an older title. It may have some... hairballs as you run it. The graphics are dated, but they honestly didn't bother me.\n\nIf you're interested in something a little different with a fair amount of inovation, you're in the right place. Addictive and fun, Majesty combines the best of city-sim-lite with the rewarding chaos of herding cats.","October 8, 2014","true","2.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/25990/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nMajesty Gold HD is advertised as "The Fantasy Kingdom Simulator", and that pretty much sums up the genre: Fantasy, Simulation, and Strategy. Majesty was developed by Cyberlore Studios. Majesty was released in 2001, Majesty Gold Edition was released in 2002, and Majesty Gold HD was released 2012.\n\nBefore people start typing up comments: the version you're getting covers all the predecessors, originally Majesty only had the bottom half of the levels you'll see in the single player game, Majesty Gold Edition included an expansion for the "Northern Expansion". Majesty was re-released in an attempt to be more compatible with windows 7 machines, two additional quests, and other minor bug fixes and improvements.  I'll elaborate on this later in my review, my apologies for making the -Quick Review- section too long.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662954883\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Greetings Majesty! I am your cryer, I've been with your family through multiple generations, and..... What's that? I see... Yes... mmhmmm.... Sorry to cut the pleasantries short Majesty, but the kingdom is in ruins and only you can fix it, because you're the only one with the almighty power to instruct the peasants to build stuff!\n\nBy this point, most people are used to being the only competent operson in video games that can issue orders, and in strategy games it's typical practice. On that note, Welcome to Majesty! A game where you don't control any characters, npcs, avatars, etc directly!\n"Woah, Woah, Atratzu!" - I hear you exclaiming. - "What kind of game are you ever talking about? If I can't do my 360 no scope's, or press A to jump, I don't think you're really talking about a video game." - Well never fear, my dear reader! I shall teach you the way of Majesty!\n\nGameplay: You play from the perspective of the "Majesty", you have 3 types of serfs: Tax collectors, Peasants, and Guards. You have some control over these characters, but you can only issue commands and they'll follow (except guards, they only patrol. But don't worry; their AI isn't that bad they're zealous zealots for you.). In addition to serfs, the Majesty can issue several different commands, you can set bounties, order spells to be cast, and set building foundations (which the peasants will then go build).\nThat's it! I've actually covered the only powers the Majest has... crazy huh? "Stop baiting us, Atratzu. You only write reviews this way when you really like a game." Wow! What a bunch of astute reader you all are!\n\nWe next move on to the mechanic that will MAKE or BREAK the game for you: Heroes. There are many different types of heroes, and I'll spare you a 'tutorial-review' explaining the differences, mainly these are different types of AI creatures running around and doing their own things. But as the Majesty you have some say in what they might do.\nFor example, say you have a blacksmith, and marketplace, if your hero has enough gold, he or she might purchase armor upgrades, or potions, or both if the hero has enough money. But which will the hero prioritize? I don't know, you'll need to watch them!\n\nIn a Way I feel like a Queen Ant (Don't look into this analogy too much, mmmmk? It's too late isn't it. *sigh*), I set up my nest, and then all my little babies run around doing stuff. While I myself am quite boring, I get to watch and see the adventurers the little ones are having!\n\nBefore someone dismisses my obviously nostalgia blinded perspective, the game challenges you by giving you different objects and restricting certain buildings to be built in certain missions. You might need to beat a mission using only archers and warriors. In one Expert-Difficulty Mission you cannot build ANY-GUILDS (You need to build guilds to hire heroes): you can only hire heroes and pray to the Ardania gods that the Monsters don't melt your kingdom before you can explore enough to get help! So in a way, you could say Majesty is a combination of a "puzzle" and "strategy game", with many randomly generated elements.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662957053\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam Achievements for Majesty Gold HD. Sad really...\n\nPrice: Majesty Gold HD is priced at $9.99, actually... I think I still have my Majesty Gold Edition CD somewhere around my still packed up game library in my apartment. Majesty can be a pretty big time sink, since there's a lot of RNG going on in the background, which might make your play through more difficult or easier, you can easily sink more then 10 hours into the game, thereby making the price 1 dollar per hour (my value system is: I like every dollar to go towards an hour of gameplay.)\n\n*Multiplayer and Optimization I don't normally care about Multiplayer, but I've noticed a handful of negative reviews complaining about it, and a lot of forum posts asking for help setting it up. Honestly I never cared to play multiplayer, it seems that some really tech savvy people in the community have come up with methods to play multiplayer, I'll include some links to articles if you want to do some reading and downloading to get it working. (It does seem that playing on a LAN would be easiest and the least painful, but not everyone has that option)\nRegarding Optimization, Majesty Gold HD may be more compatible with windows 7, but it sure didn't show up on my computer (I begrudgingly upgraded my gaming rig to windows 10. Don't get me started; I hated windows 8.1 on a desktop more), I had to make changes to the launch of the game so I could stream it over twitch, and get it into window mode. I've poked around and saw there are other suggestions for optimization, you can chose your favorite.\nRegarding the windows 7 optimization, I downloaded Majesty HD to my Win 7 laptop (Which is getting kinda old), Majesty Gold HD worked beautifully! So at this point I can say this much; Win 7 it works fantastic, Win 10 it works but not nearly as smoothly, and may require file tweaking or launch editing. (the Launch Edits that I did were: "-useddblit -blitmovietobackground -w" without the quotation marks)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662960961\n\nConclusion: I think it's pretty clear I love this game, as I mused to myself over twitch: "Part of my love definitely comes from the flood of memories when I played it in the summer of my high school years, remembering the summer vacations away from school playing Majesty Gold Edition and listening to the radio... mom coming downstairs telling me 'DON'T YOU DARE SPEND YOUR WHOLE SUMMER INDOORS'." *sniff* brings a happy tear to Atratzu's eye.\n\nIt's clear *I* love this game, but the real question is: Will you? The good news is that Majesty has been on sale for 75% off in the past, so you can wait until it's pocket-lint-price before trying it out. But if you're a very careful spender, you'll want to remember the key points of my review: You don't control, or do anything very direct. You Build, you cast spells. You're basically playing Fantasy Sim City. If that sounds fun, try it! If it sounds like a pain, might want to skip it.\nMajesty has aged, there's no doubt about that. Has it aged well? I think it has aged decently so far, because the sprites are more cartoon styled, but this game definitely isn't for everyone. I would suggest Majesty Gold HD to anyone whom enjoys older games (I should start calling them "seasoned", sounds more sophisticated!), strategy games, puzzle games, and fantasy game genre's.

Put a marker down with some cash on it, and someone will take care of it.\nSwimming in cash, but your heroes are broke, and under-equipped? Put a 4000 gold bounty on a rat, and watch them stimulate the economy fast.\n\nIt does get trickier on the higher difficulties, but once you've got the hang of it, it's both challenging and rewarding.

Instead of building up an army and marching your soldiers to destroy an enemy’s base, you have to construct a small town around your castle in order to ensure that the heroes you recruit have all that they need to be successful.\n\nHeroes can’t be controlled directly, but their actions are a reflection of their class (e.g. Rangers like exploring, Rogues like to steal) and of the rewards banners that you put up. You have two types of banners: attack banners and explore banners that will reward your heroes with an amount of gold you set for attacking a monster or monster den or exploring a location, respectively. While this may sound hard to juggle, it really isn’t and Majesty does a tremendous job of creating missions that are both challenging and fun.\n\nOne of my favorite games of all time, I can’t tell you how many hours I spent playing this as a kid. Coming back to it years later to replay it on Steam just made me a remember what an amazing game this is. Every strategy fan should add this game to their collection!","March 28","true","54.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's an RTS that subverts everything regularly present in the genre, and doing it with a great sense of humor to boot. Instead of troops you have heroes, and that distinction is huge. Rather than amassing an army and micromanaging it directly, you hire individual heroes who usually aren't keen to throw away their life for the crown - you can't give direct orders, but instead you provide incentive to these heroes and hope that the price on the head of the monster you want dead outweighs the allure of a day in the local tavern.","April 2","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I played this game when I was a kid over winter break and had a lot of spare time to waste in randomly regenerating maps just because things went wrong.\n\nThese days, my time is more valuable. It's very annoying when your heroes make stupid mistakes like not attacking the ratman who's chasing your tax collector with 2000 gold right outside your palace, or when the dragon attacks you on day 2 or 3 before your palace is even developed and you don't even have a shot at winning unless you get very lucky right away with wizard blasts making contact as they dodge the dragon's breath.\n\nAlso, the game really isn't a "Kingdom Sim". There are early peaks in how quickly you go through the tech tree in Majesty, and don't have anything left to do. You can build several Fairgrounds with Royal Gardens and Temples all around for fun while using the cheat to spawn waves of rock golems and dragons, but eventually, your heroes reach incredibly high levels, so nothing can challenge you. This usually happens within an hour or two of playing a mission, so the replay value is very small aside from completing scenarios.\n\nI bothered to write this since I got this game in a bundle with Majesty 2 just to see how that game is. Ultimately, the only reason to buy this is if you're just that curious to see what the game's about.","January 4","false","9.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

While it is up to you to build guilds and hire heroes, once recruited those heroes go off and do their own thing - exploring, finding loot, and killing monsters. It is up to you to use the money you collect in taxes to build structures that support your heroes and make them stronger, allowing you to expand your town and your economy. Rather than issuing orders, you offer incentives, in the form of cash bounties, to entice your heroes to explore a specific spot, take down a certain troublesome monster, or band together to besiege a dark lair.\n\nThe game doesn't have a campaign per se - rather, it is a series of independent missions of varying difficulty. However, each of these scenarios is unique and tasks you with achieving a singular objective, sometimes under a time limit, other times without access to certain kinds of structures and heroes. You can also generate your own freestyle quests for endless custom action!","April 7, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The northern quests are PREPOSTEROUSLY hard, and almost take the enjoyment out of this game.. still, if you can beat them i would imagine the satisfaction brought by the victory.","March 28, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, you don't control any of the people's actions, and can only guide and give some minor aide. Different hero types have different goals, and this leads to great depth in the game. You have plenty of early available scenarios to work out different strategies for the huge difficulty curve in the last unlocked scenarios. Setting up your own scenario is also very fun and where I sunk the most hours in when I first had this game many years ago.\n\nThe sound effects, one-liners, and music can either aggravate or charm, as they WILL be repeated.\n\nIn a niche within a genre that's mostly about organizing large forces, Majesty allows a slightly more hands-off playstyle that allows focus on the broad strokes. It also gives the player enough broad strokes to play around with to keep the pace active.","December 21, 2013","true","23.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I have fond memories of playing it as a child, many times doing so for hours on end. The game brings with it a sense of wonder and magic and introduces you to fantastic lands, courageous heroes, and frightening monsters. It is truly one of a kind.\n\nWhere Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim shines is in its gameplay of indirect hero control, where instead of simply telling your subjects to do this or that, you provoke your heroes to action through offering bounties and rewards for completing tasks, offers which they may or may not accept depending on their individual temperaments and strengths. This feature adds a certain depth of strategy and difficulty as well as oftentimes bringing about frustrating situations - it really allows for unique, individual gameplay experiences and provides certain replayability value.\n\nAdding to the replayability value of Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is the Freestyle Mode. In this mode, you are free to set up your own starting conditions and objectives. In addition, the Freestyle maps are randomly generated using a seed, allowing different landscapes practically everytime.\n\nMajesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is an excellent game and is well worth the price. I recommend this game!","March 8, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

But my second time through here I've noticed some massive shortcomings as far as the difficulties and artificial challenges of the quests.  They don't really pose any actual challenge and you can win pretty easily if you follow certain steps and get lucky.  This is not my idea of enjoyable gameplay.   The custom scenarios are quite fun however, and it is nice to watch the kingdom develop.  If you're going to try the quests however I'll warn you right now, you usually just end up exploiting shortcomings in the game to beat the levels.
