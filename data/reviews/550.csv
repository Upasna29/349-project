Tank also enjoy stamp collecting, scrapbooking, and updating blog under pen name "Love Muffin". Tank took origami class once at adult-learning annex, but fingers to big, so Tank smash teacher.

It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.\n\nThere's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!\n\nAlso you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.\n\nThere's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.\n\nScavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.\n\nThen, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.","November 25, 2013","true","203.2"," 2,309 of 2,532 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","309","2","0","47"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atomlib/recommended/550/","atomlib","atomlib","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atomlib/","819 products in account","Yes, this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes, even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well, let me explain.\n\nIs it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half-Life 2 and episodes. Yes, it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's: a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open-world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.\n\nBut don't think graphics are bad. No, they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement, nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations: infected puke, beat eachother, walk around, die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies: some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism, I'm just getting started.)\n\nSo maybe the story is the main element here? Nope, you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry, medical supplies, some other stuff. You have a very simple goal: get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.\n\nSo why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.\n\nWords cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies, 3 basic types of main weapons, a few different secondary weapons, grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.\n\nLeft 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well, every time different items get generated in different places, you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over, again and again. And people actually do.\n\nSpeaking of people, it's a multiplayer. Yes, there is single-player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation, you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players, maybe you should play with friends, maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap, you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back, sharing resources with them. Oh, and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.\n\nThere is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team, they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo, but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.\n\nI think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates “%gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11” and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes, you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago, finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours — its gameplay was dull. Yes, you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away, you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. “Easy to learn, difficult to master” — yes, we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters, who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much, just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls, a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.\n\nValve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art, you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic, and is it bad? Nope, it's fine, it's a videogame, not a reflection of reality.\n\nThere is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything, it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic: they create games with some new elements. They create a game, it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better, they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half-Life 3 may never happen: what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times, it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.\n\nBut right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game, and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored, there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b-a-s-t-a-r-d-ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).","February 10","true","324.0"," 189 of 194 people (97%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","97","189","194","17","9"

It's one of those essential games every PC gamer must have in their Steam library. It's a massive step-up to the first game in the franchise and it would take a lot of hardwork and determination to make a sequel that could ever hope to topple this one.\n\nI could write a much longer in-depth review about this brilliant game, but either you, the reader already acknowledge a lot about this game, through its strong magnitude and reputation. On the other hand, I personally would just want to leave it as the hidden gem, for the very small, minimal group of people who are still not familiar with this game, even to this day. With a message to those people, being simple and direct; you will not be disappointed by how much this game lives up to.\n\nI would advice the newcomers to this game to take it slowly and definitely look out for the -75% off sales or even better, the free offer of this game which is most frequently appearing on big Steam sales.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/recommended/550/","GopherGaming","Gopher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/","352 products in account","The successor to Left 4 Dead, this second game adds new maps, new weapons, new special infected with new attacks and even new characters. But in many ways the most important different between the two games is the scoring system.\n\nWithout mods, the first games scoring system really did tend to induce rage. A single mistake on a map and you could lose so many points that teams would be totally demoralized and either fall apart (making the game effectively over) or just quit (making it absolutely over). For hardcore players this was half the fun, but for the average casual player it could make Left 4 Dead a little too frustrating.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 on the other hand had a far more forgiving score system allowing teams who fail badly on map 1 to still feel they have a good chance of clawing the in back in the next 3 or 4 maps. With party wipes being a little less likely due to the removal of the quad cap, Left 4 Dead 2 is still a game people can play causally and still enjoy. With the extra variety of a lot more special infected meaning a lot more variety in possible tactics, Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best team focused games that I have ever played.\n\nIf you have a small group of close friends who love winning through superior team work rather than superior twitch skills, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best PvP games you could try. But be warned, playing with random people you have never met can be rewarding, but more often than not it can be bloody annoying.\n\nHOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkylarKitty/recommended/550/","SkylarKitty","Mrawri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkylarKitty/","274 products in account","L4D2 is a vast improvement in L4D in almost every respect. It actually has a plot for starters. Each chapter flows into the next as the four main characters try to escape hordes of the infected. That's right! They're not actually zombies folks! They're just humans infected by a virus that makes them exhibit zombie like personality traits, a plot line also been used a million times. But the plot is really not what matters here, it's not supposed to be important, as much as the plot as I got from the game without trying to find it was "Here are some zombies, here is a gun, have fun." What we're really here for is the gameplay.\n\nIn addition to your weapons you can hold presents such as Molotov's or Pipe Bomb's, the latter of which is incredibly useful and incredibly awesome to behold. If you don't enjoy hundreds of zombies piling together then have their exploded body parts ragdoll through the air then something clearly went wrong when God was handing out the human brains and bird brains.\n\nAlong with your dopey common infected are the more dangerous and lethal special infected who can ravage through a player's health in a matter of seconds as well as separate them from the group. These zombies must be brought down together and the players must constantly stay together to rescue each other from these zombies unless they want to lie down seductively on a dinner plate instead. The strongest of these are the Witch and the Tank, The Witch being able down a player in a single hit and The Tank having ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly insane amounts of health. All four players must stay together and work together to progress through the levels and do what is required of them depending on which chapter they are playing. The inclusion of these special infected zombies makes the game much more interesting and challenging than other zombies as well as bucketloads more fun.\n\nWhile playing through the same five campaigns may not seem like a good length for a game, this is made up by the other modes L4D2 brings along. There's the usual survival mode that almost every shooter has nowadays. Scavenger mode where you play the worst ♥♥♥♥ing part of the game over and over. And Versus mode where you get to play as one of special infected zombies in a team of four and try to stop the humans from reaching the safe house. This is one of the few games where I actually enjoyed the multiplayer, maybe it's because the game is focussed around it but that's beside the point. Versus mode kept me entertained for hours on end and even now I would go back and play it.\n\nThe real reason that people can replay L4D2 over and over even though it's the same level is because of a bit of smart programming called the "AI Director." The AI Director has the ability to change the placement of walls, weapons, power ups and items in each level as well as being able to spawn hordes of zombies and special infected. This is done to an extent on one level on the fourth play through I was still discovering new paths through the level. No game has anything else like this and it is a unique bit of programming on Valve's behalf.\n\nBUT, remember that sentence about body parts flying through the air? Well that is in the game, but not in the Australian version. The Australian version of L4D2 has been cut down and censored to fit under the MA15+ label as we have no R18+ classification. Even Valve themselves were startled and confused by the refusal of the classification and I can understand why completely, the original game is not that bloody or violent that it would need to be banned. So say goodbye to corpses, body piles, gore, dismemberment and decapitation, apparently if we see that we will all turn cannibal and eat each other.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is a standout game that deserves the praise it gets. The gameplay is highly entertaining with good replay value due to the AI Director as well as beautifully atmospheric. The online multiplayer is actually quite good which coming from me is a massive ♥♥♥♥ing compliment so go out, buy this game, and witness it's mastery.","November 25, 2013","true","311.3"," 645 of 777 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","645","777","0","10"

Once I got a PC that could run Left 4 Dead 2, I discovered that Left 4 Dead really has no end of enjoyment. It is not for everyone of course, but if you like slaying zombies, exploration, teamwork, fun with friends, and some hilarious moments, this game is excellent.\n\nIt is now 2016, and still, people are making mods, addons, skins, new game modes, and creating unique servers that change the rules of the game. It is hard to get bored with a game that people keep adding to this much.\n\nYou will unfortunately hear about, or experience yourself, bad players on this game. This goes for EVERY game out there on the Internet. If there is a way to ruin other players' fun, there are people who will try to do it. Please don't blame the game for bad players. Left 4 Dead 2 still has hundreds, maybe thousands of players who love to have a good time and try to support eachother in game. I'm one of those. =D If you have a bad experience, try again please. More good-natured players are always welcome.\n\nTo me, this is the best game in the world right now. This is because it provides a fun way to meet cool and amazing people, who enjoy this great game where you are rewarded for working TOGETHER, instead of just killing eachother. The game itself provides lots of fun, but what really makes it amazing are the people you play with, and people who continue to make the game better.\n\nI have put off writing a review to this game for so long, because I really can't say enough about it. This review seems like it barely scratches the surface to me. All I can say is try it. TRY IT. Join some games, download some add ons and try those. Remember not to take it too seriously. Get killed, laugh, try to get better, die more, laugh even more.

It is a sequel to the previous game Left 4 Dead.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 lets you play as another group of four survivors on a brand new campaign with a crossover campaign from the first game too. These new survivors are Rochelle, Coach, Ellis and Nick. This sequel has more game modes to play and even more choice of weapons to use against the undead, but there are also new types of special infected too, so be prepared to be amazed, or dead. It seems that Valve finally decided to add Left 4 Dead campaign into this new game, but the feels are different as the new infected also present in the old campaign along with the new weapons and improved graphics, making the game even more replayable.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 also comes with Steam Workshop support so there are lots of user made custom content you can download to customize your game, like custom weapons, custom survivors, custom infected and special infected, custom maps and event some people made custom campaign with their own story. You can also make your own content and share it with public.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a really good sequel.

The left 4 dead games "both of them" are games that are unlike anything else I have ever played, they are games that quite literally changed my entire life. These games are the types of games that you can meet people on that will be friends for years to come and these games also have an unreal amount of replay value. you have campaign for the casual players with addon support so you have an almost endless amount of maps to play if you dont mind downloading more, you have versus which can be really fun, but sadly in both games unless you play with friends the community is either tryhards that care too much about winning or people that are so terrible that you wonder how they even got their computer running in the first place. Lastly there is survival, my personal favorite game mode. People in the survival community "once you actually find the real survival players" are useually a nice bunch of people and its a game mode unlike the other two in a good way once you give it a chance. Honestly both of these games although they both are titled "Left 4 Dead" are very different and many people i have run into tend to think of one game as simply better than the other, but objectively speaking this is simply not the case. Both games are too different to really make that kind of judgement. Both of these games are games that if you enjoy this type of gameplay, then you could waste thousands of hours on them.\n\nBut this brings up the biggest problem with these games, the people in them. Do enough searching and you will find people you can mingle with but the majority of public players in either game regardless of game mode are unbelieveably dumb. In vs also not just the really dumb people but you have the typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s found in any game based around pvp that seem to think that winning makes them more important somehow as a person and don't seem to realize that there is no reward for winning in a l4d games like there is in a competitive game like counter strike or dota with their tournaments.\n\nCampaign is a really casual game mode compared to the other two but still there tends to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this game mode too sometimes, people that find joy in joining pub games just to grief their teammates for some reason and then leave without a word. Thankfully this is rare and most people in campaign are either mute or friendly.\n\nThen there is survival, a game mode that brings me more enjoyment but also more frustration than any other mode. In L4D2 it seems to be a collection of people that for some stupid reason refuse to play anything except for the mall map, people that are actually really terrible at it too and can run laps for 100+ min on mall sure but could not get a gold on any other map to save their life. There is l4d1 survival as well which is a dif style of play but the community is dying off because all of the players who have been around a long time have gotten tired of the game and pubs are beyond stupid. Always either people trying to glitch a time or people so bad/dumb you wonder if they were dropped on their head as a baby 5 times.\n\nAll in all, You will enjoy the l4d games, both of them if you enjoy co-op based shooters, but you will have to endure a very mixed crowd of people regardless of game, with the first game haveing a somewhat more friendly crowd cause of the smaller community. I would recommend both games if you have the patience to search for people worth talking to or have someone to go into the game with.","December 10, 2014","true","225.5"," 111 of 124 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","111","124","4","12"

I met most people on my friends list on it and became really good friends with some of them.\n\nI'm mostly a Scavenge and Survival player. Yeah, I don't really like Versus and Campaign, which are the most played game modes. Being a Scavenge player, where the community is way smaller, I get to know basically everyone who plays it regularly and when I join a game (mostly on the Rooftop map) it's guaranteed that I will meet someone there who is either on my friends list or that I knew before just by playing. I'd say the best years to play this game mode where 2010-2013, it just died from there on to nowadays, but surprisingly, there's people who still play Scavenge, so there's always at least 1 game.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2's main problem, unlike most FPS games, isn't hackers. It's the community itself, specially the tryhards. Those morons that take video gaming more seriously than real life (well, they probably don't have a proper life to begin with anyway). Yeah, they get mad in public matches if people don't have over 2.000 hours and don't skeet every Hunter they see, even if their team is winning. You're going to have a hard time playing the PvP gamemodes, Scavenge and Versus, if you don't have at least 200 or 300 hours on Campaign and Survival you're going to be judged (if your profile isn't set to private or friends-only).\n\nDon't expect a horror shooting game, there's no horror elements in Left 4 Dead 2. The creepiest thing (if you can call it that) is the Witch, and even so, she's kinda... cute. Expect an action game with a toxic PvP community and a (mostly) friendly PvE one.","August 21, 2015","true","133.1"," 76 of 81 people (94%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","94","76","81","17","3"

Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).\n\n2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.\n\n3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.\n\n4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.\n\n5)  Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.\n\n6)  Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.","December 15, 2014","true","10.4"," 731 of 1,034 people (71%) found this review helpful 563 people found this review funny","71","731","1","563","30"

(Campaign, Versus, Survival, Scavenge)\n● The Lobby/Drop-in system works flawlessy allowing players to effortlessly finding a game.\n● Free DLC.\n● A New Gamemode! Scavenge!\n● Mutation System, play or create your own gamemodes!\n● Workshop!\n● Make your own Maps!\n● Low PC Specs required.\n● Get to play as Special Infected! (Yeah.. those Zombies..!) in Versus mode.\n● A bigger variety in Special Infected compared to Left 4 Dead\n● Very Easy to setup your own Dedicated Server.\n\nCons\n● Players have to download Maps manually, they are unable to download from the Server they are joining, same goes for Custom Made mutations.\n● The Game is unpolished in regards to exploits and bugs, Valve has never responded to countless reports and complaints.\n● No Matchmaking, you're very likely to end up with very unbalanced teams when joining Versus games.\n● A weak Attempt at "Clan/team Matches" by introducing "Team Versus", "Team Scavenge" modes.\n● Ragequitting is not punished at all.\n\nThe Community\nThe Community for Left 4 Dead 2 is very comparable to Left 4 Dead, in Public Games you can expect to be insulted and possibly even votekicked if you're underperforming in the eyes of your teammates. However, in Co-op gameplay this is a much less frequent occurence.\nThere however is still a breathing Competitive Scene, this scene is much better in terms of actually being able to finish your games as well as making buddies and playing on much more balanced and difficult "Gamemodes".\nI'd advertise if I knew for sure it was allowed. :D\n\nCurrent Status of the Game\nAs of this post, Left 4 Dead 2 has an 30-Day Average of 9033 Players Worldwide.\nThe game is definitely alive and has games to join all the time in my area. (West-Europe)\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 Costs $20 which is the same price as for its predecessor, Left 4 Dead.\n\nFinal Words\nLeft 4 Dead 2, in its current state is well worth the full $20, even if you're going for just a little bit of Campaign and Survival. The more friends you have to play this with, the more fun you'll have.\n\n● 5 Original L4D2 Campaigns.\n● 6 L4D1 Maps DLC.\n● 1 The Passing DLC.\n● 1 Cold Stream DLC.","October 18, 2014","true","554.2"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","64","73","3","8"

Do you like guns? Do you like Mariocart? Do you like to spam right-click like your middle finger has Parkinsons? Well you are going to love this!\n\nL4D2 is a unique, fast paced twitch shooter with loads of replayability. Even if you get bored of the official valve content there are tons of fun community maps to try out. In particular I recommend Questionable Ethics and The Bloody Moors. Despite the zombie theme L4D2 is not really a horror game and the L4D2 campaign and characters in particular are pretty cartoonish compared to the darker design of the original Left 4 Dead. However, all of the L4D1 maps were ported over to L4D2 a long time ago now, so there isn't much need to buy the original unless you are really curious or nostalgic about it.\n\nThe game is getting a bit old now with alot less people online than there used to be. Consequently mosty of the players you find online are either veterans/long term addicts of the game or newbies from the previous sale. This only really applies to the PvP modes of the game (Versus and Scavenge) but new players are going to have a tough time in public games because of this. L4D2 does not have a very high skill ceiling like Counter Strike or Quake but there is still a fairly steep learning curve to start with. In any random public game you are likely to be playing with players who have 1000+ hours who know the maps like the back of their hand and know all the various little tricks and strats. You will find them frustrating to play against and they will find it frustrating having you on their team. This is the kind of game where one player can really drag a whole team down so if you are that player you can expect to be kicked alot. If you are new you should start out playing versus with friends, or get onto some 10v10 commuinity servers where you can mess around without getting kicked from the game.\n\nPeople say that the public versus community is really terrible but I dont think it is any worse than other PvP games apart from the fact that some of the game mechanics specific to L4D2 make people rage such as the forced dependence on teammates and some of the inherent randomness of the game. In fact I would say that the versus community is better now that it was 4 years ago when the game was more popular. For example most of the time now people will 'ready up' before starting a round, whereas before it was normal to see people deliberately rushing out of spawn while players are still loading in. But yeah... if you are new you are going to need thick skin in public versus.\n\nVersus is definately the most replayable mode, and the reason why many people keep playing this game for thousands of hours, but it what I said above puts you off you can always stick to playing the co-operative modes which are slower paced and with more easygoing players. The exception to this is expert difficulty, where friendly fire damage is signifigant and effects playstyle alot. Because of friendly fire expert is also the biggest target for griefers. Playing alot of expert co-op will make you paranoid about teamkillers and you will start to accumulate a nice big blocklist.\n\nAnyway what I have written might come across as negative but I think it is honest view based on over 2000 hours of gameplay which by itself says alot about addictive and replayable this game is. I don't think I have ever played any other game for as many hours, and no other game has made me laugh or rage as much as L4D2.","February 17, 2015","true","515.8"," 48 of 49 people (98%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","98","48","49","8","6"

This is probably the most teamwork-oriented game I'll ever play. Not even Team Fortress 2 can compare to the importance of teamwork in a game like this. I can't stress enough that spelunking alone will get you killed.\n\nGameplay in general? It's alright. I'm no professional critic, but I can say it's simple enough to understand. Shoot zombies, get inside safehouses, try not to die.\n\nOh and I love the voice talents. So many lines for performing a single action, like apologizing, getting saved, and even looking at safehouse graffiti.\n\nGood game.\n","August 23, 2015","true","110.7"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","44","46","6","0"

It doesn't try to keep you playing with progression, but with sheer FUN. While a lot of online games these days will beat you over the head with an experience bar and taunt you with unlockables, Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't keep anything from you, and from the word go, you have access to whatever equipment you find randomly strewn across its maps. It focuses on making any given campaign run or round of versus unique and interesting, and you as a player get to enjoy the journey instead of simply anticipating the destination. This isn't a game where you grab the SMG because you want some kind of SMG bonus afterward, or you sneak past a sobbing zombie woman so you can get an experience bonus the next time you play. This is a game where you grab a shotgun because you want to shoot that Witch in her stupid, crying face.","March 31, 2015","true","905.5"," 39 of 39 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","39","39","5","2"

Some of the Levels are designed slightly creepy and all of them are having a different type of theme. A roller coaster, or the swamp, a storm at night? Everything's possible.\nBut what's woth to buy this game, when you can't kill those guys? Well - you can! And to do so you can find a bunch of different weapons all over the maps. An Axe, Machete, Katana, and - of course - guns. A lot of guns.\nThe story isn't anything really new, but for zombie-games there isn't much space to experiment with that. But it's not bad in any way.\n\nFinal words: This game is much fun to play with friends, or all alone with the help of the your fellows. With a lot of different modes you can spend a lot of time in this great game and it's definitely worth it.","January 27, 2014","true","214.2"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","46","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s-team-community/recommended/550/","s-team-community","flikk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s-team-community/","84 products in account","Left 2 Die is a military shooter developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It's focused around a group of five highly-trained military professionals and is known for its high degree of realism and gritty, immersive plot.\nUnfortunately, the game falls short of excellence for several reasons. First, the game does not let you use iron sights on any of the weapons. This detracts greatly from the realism of the game and makes complex tactics like run-and-gun completely unviable. Second, there are no custom classes or leveling system. The lack of a ranking system, or "Prestige," means that there is no sense of fulfillment in the game. You cannot paint your weapons different colors to make them distinct and realistic, nor can you unlock stronger weapons, forcing you to rely purely on luck, and spending hours upon hours scavenging for supplies and usable equipment is a complete chore. Additionally, the game lacks prone and sprint mechanics. This is very unrealistic because you cannot lie on the ground and you cannot go fast enough for to the game.\nAside from the five original soldiers, the game allows you to play as eight different "SI's," or Secret Infiltrators. The SI fill varying roles, from support to close-quarters combat, to intelligence-gathering. Unfortunately, the game discourages teamwork, leaving players with almost no tactical options. Additionally, the Infiltrators cannot use firearms, which detracts from the realism of the game. This is surprising, considering that the developers at Treyarch have a long history of creating tactical masterpieces.\nThe levels are poorly designed, with no objective other than to make it from one Staging Room to the next, with a lengthy extraction stage at the end of every operation. These frantic levels are just confusing, making the game very hostile towards newcomers. It is disappointing that Square Enix decided to develop a tactical modern military shooter with no objective other than survival.\nIn spite of the game's numerous flaws, the devs at Rovio have truly outdone themselves in creating a modern masterpiece of storytelling. The narrative in Left 2 Die, the newest game from renown developer Naughty Dog, is involving and profoundly emotional, moreso than their earlier titles such as "LittleBigPlanet" and "The First of Them." The five soldiers all have very distinct personalities, and the backstory is rich and enchanting. The ending is nothing short of sublime; without spoiling anything, Irrational Games has managed to surpass the storytelling sucess seen in their earlier title, "System Shock."\nLeft 2 Die follows an episodic format, allowing players to purchase each episode seperately or buy a "Season Card" to make every episode available the minute they are completed by Rockstar Games. Each episode is roughly 30 minutes long and ends in a stunning cliffhanger that blends in seamlessly with the next episode. This innovative DLC format is sure to pave the way for games to come, and at $40 per episode, is worth every penny.\nThe Creative Assembly has truly outdone themselves in their latest game, Left 2 Die. The title is sure to satisfy all types of gamers, from the casual to the hardcore, and is literally flawless.\nOverall, I rate the latest DOTA 2 expansion pack, Left 2 Die, a 10/0, unforgettable.\n\nEDIT: Also something about the community being a literal cesspit","January 16, 2014","true","152.0"," 129 of 186 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","129","186","0","27"

The gameplay and various stories really tops it off.\n\nThat's the sad part.\n\nUnless you decide that you want to play solo or maybe with some friends, don't bother with this game. It's really nice, and I mean REALLY nice to play offline, but any attempt to play online will be immediately refuted by the majority of players who happen to be super pro elitist ***holes. You will get kicked for everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. I've been kicked for opening a door, healing a partner, accidentally incapacitating a partner who was at 1 health and in the middle of the crossfire, using a med kit because I'm low on health, being pinned by a zombie, AND MY FAVORITE, being a f***king new guy.

A simple word, 'Community'. Out of all of the communities of games, movies, etc, this is the worst one I have ever came across. This community is full of elitists, ridden with them. They always kick you for doing the slightest thing wrong or not doing what they want you to do.\nFor example;\n\nAbout to die and stops to heal = kick.\nKilling a zombie that someone else was about to kill = kick.\nJust missing a player as a charger = kick.\nWalks out of spawn and immediately gets pounced = kick.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game you ask? It's because of the game itself. I only play this game with friends (for obvious reasons) and that is a highly fun experience.

Fans fairly assumed that under the guise of the second part to us will offer the same Left 4 Dead only improved and finished. Actually, so it also turned out – here only completions so change Left 4 Dead 2 that after a game couple of hours in it already there are no wish to remember all the charges at all. History repeats itself. In Valve didn't begin to invent any fancy plot, it here it is simple to anything. Survived again four, around again the zombie and to reach a quiet place, it is necessary to pass five levels, each of which to a limit is saturated with dangers of death. Were replaced unless scenery – in the second part they any more so gloomy, we should spend a lot of time and on the open spaces filled in with the sun. However, and this change is made not for appearance, and for the sake of gameplay improvement. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).","February 20, 2014","true","14.1"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spitora/recommended/550/","spitora","M<4tt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spitora/","40 products in account","I can honestly say that Left 4 Dead 2 would be my favourite zombie multiplayer game right now. It's a sequel to Left 4 dead. Same concept but more features added. It adds newer maps, different characters, more playable special infecteds, and a bunch load of more weapons to slaughter zombies with. You basically travel through different areas with your teammates trying to find an escape route. What more can you say about it? It's a fun coop game where you can play with your friends or any other online players from across the world.\n\nBesides from just going to different saferooms and finding an escape vehicle on a finale campaign on the same maps, there are other gamemodes you can play to eliminate the boredom. Survival is a great and challenging gamemode where your teammates and you have to try to survive on a map for as long as you can with the resources that will be provided around the map. Great mode for strategy and setting a goal for surviving for maybe longer than 10 minutes or even an hour. The longer the time, the more crucial it'll get. Versus is another gamemode you can also try out. Probably is the most popular and playful gamemode in the game. It's a fun and competitive game which consist of two teams. One as special infecteds and one who plays as the survivors. After completing a map, both teams will rotate positions depending on who won last round. The team with the most points after completing the finale will be declared as the winner. This I believe is the only gamemode where you actually have the ability to play as a special infected which is a fun feature in the game.\n\nWith some of the updates that Left 4 Dead 2 offered us, you can actually have the ability to play as the old characters and the old maps from the first Left 4 dead. This means that there are more maps for you to try out and more characters for you to select. You don't even need to purchase the first Left 4 Dead. Also adds two extra maps for you to play on such as "The Sacrafice" played by the Left 4 Dead characters and "Cold Stream" played by the Left 4 Dead 2 Characters.\n\nIf you get bored of just playing normal vanilla games, you can try out some of the special steam group servers. These servers are made by other people where they can provide special features in the game that originally aren't in the game. They bring out a new level of fun and diversity. A fort spawner server for Survival where you can build a fort/shelter to help you fight away the zombies. An RPG leveling system server for Campaign and Versus where you can level up your character and acquire unique  perks and abilities to make you much stronger to slay the infected.\n\nI met most of cool online friends on this game. It has been here for a while now and is still a popular game to this day. I would extremely recommend getting this game if you're into horror, fun or just love smashing zombies with a frying pan. It's only $21.99, which is fairly a cheap price for a great game.","January 4, 2015","true","499.4"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","5"

THE FIRE JUST APPEARED UNDER MY FEET! HEEEELLPPP MEE......"\n"WHO THREW THE MOLOTOV?!"\n- What people usually say when I throw a Molotov at their feet and watch them burn\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2, even though it's a game about zombies and all that surviving and the end of the world apocalypse thing, is pretty silly. More to that later on. Right now we start off with the most important part of the review, the gameplay.\n\nGameplay: It's fun. You get to kill hundreds of zombies with guns and FIRE and the most fun weapon in the game, the chainsaw. Helping your team out by whipping out your chainsaw and going chainsaw first in the horde is awesome. Its makes you feel like an immortal badass coming to save your teammates by cutting through those zombies and showing the tank who's the best. And that all feels great!\n\nMusic: It has the creepy, zombie like feel to it. It just feels......like you’re in an apocalypse and there's no hope of surviving. It's that sad, zombie-like, songs that make you feel..........in that moment. Like you're there with what could be the survivors of the zombie apocalypse that will get through this chapter in human history! It feels like you're there, in the moment, in that place. And all that feels creepy and awesome at the same time.\n\nCommunity: There always will be noobs in the game, but that's alright since there are more people who know what they're doing and you have friends. The friends who sometimes screw you over, but always try to help you. If you're friends are not like that. I dont think you have the friends you should have. This game is so much fun with friends though. Valve did a amazing job of making you feel accomplished in there games, and this makes you feel accomplished.\n\nGraphics: They’re good. Pretty normal.\n\nMods and add-ons: Who are you if you don’t play this game with mods? Do you know what the meaning of fun is? A doge flashlight, Coach in a shirt with cheeseburgers on it, and Nick as Nicolas Cage with Cage’s heads in random places around his shirt are one of the many. Mods are love, mods are life.\n\nWhat makes this game silly?\nBesides killing hundreds of zombies with a frying pan? Mods. There are so many silly mods out there for Left 4 Dead 2.\n\nWhat shouldn’t I get this game?\nIf you don’t have many friends who have this game or aren’t willing to buy it or just don’t want to play with you. It can be tough playing this game along or with strangers who don’t talk much.\n\nEnding words:\nIf the things I said about this review makes you want to be a silly badass, then get this game! I don’t see reasons unless don’t have many friends who have this game or any of the other reasons.\n7/10\n“Pills here”\n\n*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!\n","January 7, 2014","true","44.6"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","2"

Even old, I still got some good fun moments with my friends playing some campaigns and versus sometimes; since I'm not into versus gamemode that much.\nYou will get addict to this game for a time, then take a long break after hours and hours playing the same maps - but thanks to the Workshop, you can subscribe to a tons of mods, maps and skins for your own gameplay style. There are yet popular servers of 4x4 ; 10x10 coop styles.\n\nAgain, Left 4 Dead 2 it's like an "upgraded" version from the L4D1: more special infected zombies, maps, new characters and you can still play the maps and the old characters from the first game. I strongly recommend you to buy this one first since it's better than L4D1. The workshop keep this game alive I believe.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmurfstomper/recommended/550/","thesmurfstomper","Smurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmurfstomper/","112 products in account","One of my favourite games ever. 9/10.\n\nGreat multi-player co-op game that still has a ton of replay value, six years later. Where it really shines is in Versus mode, where teams play against each other, taking turns playing as the Special Infected.  Left 4 Dead 2 is simply a must-have for all survival horror enthusiasts. The new game modes and the usual mix of adrenaline and co-op gameplay is the living(dead) proof that a sequel doesn’t always have to change its original nature to be enjoyable, very enjoyable!\n\nBefore playing Versus mode, however, make sure you have played through Campaign mode completely at least once.\n\nOf course, story is for single player games, and L4D2 certainly isn't that. To get the most out of the game, you need to play it with three other people, especially on higher difficulties where the AI companions are all but useless. They'll do a good enough job at shooting zombies, but often get sidetracked at killing a few straggling common infected, while your busy fighting a Tank. Or, they'll continually shout "We need to stick together!" when you try and keep moving, but they just won't follow you. The most frustrating is during the game's gauntlet events, where you have to go and turn off something like an alarm, and the AI just won't keep up. If you don't have access to Xbox Live, Steam then L4D2 will get old really quick. I have played the game for over 500 hours on Steam. I have also played the game for 100 hours on Xbox. So I do have enough time to make a review on the game.\n\n\nWith friends, the game is still a blast. The AI Director returns, and again changes the maps according to how well you are doing. If you're full on ammo and health packs, prepare to meet up with a host of special infected. Be on the verge of death with only a frying pan, however, and you won't face quite as many. And nothing is as exhilarating as going into a room to find a pipe bomb in one game, and trying to grab it in another game only to find a Witch sobbing in the corner.\n\nVersus mode returns, and is still the most fun of the bunch. In the eight player mode, four people are survivors, and four are the infected. All of the special infected return from the first game, including the repulsive Boomer, the ferocious Tank, and the creepy Smoker. Three new infected join the roster this time around, and fit in just great. The Charger is able to pick up a survivor, carry them, and pummel them into the ground. The Spitter spits deadly poison that lingers on the ground. And the Jockey can jump on a survivors back, steering them into danger zones such as fire or a Spitter's poison patch. Each type of special infected are unique and fun, and the addition of three more is just icing on the cake. Like the first game, playing as the special infected is still a blast - there's nothing quite like setting up an ambush with your fellow zombies to kill the survivors in Versus mode.\n\nSurvival mode makes another appearance as well. Released as DLC in the first game, it comes to L4D2 mostly unchanged, having the four survivors face waves of endless infected coming to save them, with rescue never coming. It's fun.\n\nThe environments are much more detailed and atmospheric. The rain effects are especially mind-blowing, and can make the threat of an oncoming zombie assault quite stressful when you can't see five feet in front of your face. The ways in which zombies die are also gruesomely spectacular. With the introduction of melee weapons, you can hack at certain body parts of the infected, taking off a leg, chunk of head, or outright decapitating them. Bullets also tear off flesh to reveal ribcages, and chainsaws literally rip the infected apart. There are some nagging clipping issues, such as having zombies' heads protrude through walls, or being able to walk through your allies.\n\nThe sound direction is stellar, from the powerful gun shots to the creepy, ambient groans and moans warning you of nearby special infected. The soundtrack is fitting for the American South, but could've been longer, as it repeats itself too often.\n\nThough the core gameplay remains pretty much the same, there is more than enough new content and improved action to make this zombie apocalypse highly recommendable.\n\nThe fact that there are addons makes the game even more enjoyable.\n\nOh. One negative thing? I am seriously getting fed up with most of the L4D2 public community. Just blocked my 40th person, they spent the past two hours trash talking everyone on my team with horrible insults and claiming that we all hack (all because I shot a noisy boomer through a wall).\n\nPeople who join, suicide, then leave. Who accuse others of hacking. Who call "RAGE" every time someone leaves. Who blame the server for every failure. Who swap while people are still loading in, resulting in the affected player getting kicked by the swappers team.\n\nOh and don't even get me started on the "competitive" players... (not to generalize... bad apples, you know...)\n\nIt's not very often you get to meet nice, kind, great teamplayers. But once you do, it's a blast! Search for groups who focuses on having fun rather than winning.  It's worthwile. Trust me.\n\nSlash and hack!","June 20, 2015","true","788.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","2"

This is the start of Dead Center. So, they decided to reach the local mall where a second CEDA evacuation point is located. By their way after finishing correspondence with gun shop owner Whitaker, they discovered that the mall is overrun by infected. At such a situation Ellis helped the group to use a stock car and to travel towards New Orleans, probably the last standing city of America.\n\nThe Passing stands in between Dead Center and Dark Carnival just after The Sacrifice. The four of the L4D2 survivors when arrive at the bridge of Rayford they meet Francis, Louis and Zoey. Since they need to cross the bridge so they four found the other way. After fighting their way through a wedding reception of witch bride, the streets and under the river tour they meet up again with the original survivors who provided covering fire while filling up the generator or lowering the bridge.\n\nDark Carnival starts in a highway completely blocked by ditched vehicles. Starting from there survivors reached at an abandoned amusement park. At the park stadium Coach found a plan to use a large scale light show used by The Midnight Riders to signal the rescue chopper.\n\nYet bad luck… they found the chopper pilot is infected! Naturally, Nick killed him and it crashed so also Swamp Fever starts. So, crossing the swamps the group finally arrives at plantation mansion and makes radio contact with Virgil, a boat captain. But his boat starts to run low on diesel on the way to New Orleans. Hard rain starts, the survivors go to shore at Ducatel. Crossing a witch infested sugarcane mill finally they get gas from gas station and return back with fuels to signal Virgil.\n\nVirgil drops the group at New Orleans where military is evacuating civilians across a bridge. But the four discovered that the city is completely overrun by infected and so the military is actually leaving the city before it is destroyed by air strike. However, survivors managed to reach the bridge and made contact with the military. Then crossing the bridge they were evacuated by chopper and the bridge was destroyed with the end of The Parish.\n\nAll the best so far but the day is important because we have night!!! :) I don’t mean this for zombie apocalypse though!! :) So, foxed? :-D Well, you may encounter various types of trolls (special infecteds? :d), ... ... etc. etc. in the community when you will want multiplayer but just don’t let them feel you down ever to enjoy the thrills of the game because I assure you they are never more than a few. :)\n\nSo, don’t you want to experience all these in more details playing the game by your own?

You can also crank up the difficulty for a challenge (be warned though that if you're playing in expert mode, bring 3 other friends)!\n\nOne issue I had with this game were the origin of the weapons (in other words, the way the weapons were held). The original game was fine but now, they're too centered in the screen and/or take up too much space (like the hunting rifle). However, this issue can be "fixed" in the workshop by downloading custom content and there's even an add-on that re-origins the default weapons. If you cannot find something in the workshop that you want/like, don't worry as it's very easy to install custom add-ons (from other websites) through the L4D2 file directories.\n\nThere is another problem I keep facing when playing online in public lobbies.

Sometimes, there are trolls too and it may be necessary to kick them. The worst issue I had was versus in which players kept on leaving after dying as survivors.\n\nStill, this is a good game to play with friends and I recommend it.","July 15, 2014","true","708.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","3"

Plenty of fun with friends and a very enjoyable versus mode. The coop system is the best ever seen in the games history. The animations are incredibly fluid, some of the best I've seen so far in a game. The dialogues are great, the characters say a lot of different things and are never annoying or ripetitive. Definitely worth for buying. I'm not what you would call a "video game person", yet after playing this once, I've been obsessed with this game. Much better than the sequence (card game) and the infected characters are definitely worth the time ESPECIALLY THE SURVIVORS SINCE THEY'VE ADDED WORKSHOP , WHERE YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEIR CLOTHES THE GUNS GOD ITS EVERYTHING. Multiplayer! cooperative or competitive! Teamwork actually means something here. You can do more than just shoot guns. Controlling special abilitied Zombies is a unique experience. SCAVENGE MODE (OMG) You are not only feel like a member of your team, you need to cooperate every time and your team needs to coop back aswell or your brains will get eaten (kidding or then "you wont get any chance against the other team (if they know the game more than u do) , btw there's always TUTORIAL about scavenge so u can go ahead and see those.

First off, if you're looking for a hardcore, serious, emotional zombie game with a realistic storyline, KEEP LOOKING! This game has a bit of an Arcadish feel to it, as none of the characters are really serious about saving their own asses. Instead, they make funny remarks at activities like killing zombies. This game is awesome, except for one thing. THE FRIGGIN' COMMUNITY!!! Unless you have amazing skills or some friends to play with, do NOT buy this game. As soon as you make 1 mistake in  a Versus game, everyone calls you something like Dumbass! or F*cking Idiot followed by an amazingly fast votekick that litterally EVERYONE votes yes for. That's really what I hate, and it made the game extremely annoying. The game also gets very repeditive and boring. So, in summarry it's an awesome game, but you NEED friends to play it. So, unfortunately, I will have to rate this game down. I'm really torn about it, but the community sucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3kliksphilip/recommended/550/","3kliksphilip","3kliksphilip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3kliksphilip/","182 products in account","The best cooperative game in the world, without a doubt.\n\nI don't know how to explain it- with this gaming series Valve created their own genre. It looks old and cliched, with the zombies, promises of teamwork and lots of guns, but ignore that: it's a surprisingly refreshing concept done in such an original way that there is nothing to compare it to. It was well received but I still think that this game was underrated. Left 4 Dead 3, if it ever comes out, will tip the world on its head. Best start preparing for it now with L4D2!\n\nThe game DEMANDS teamwork, and actively encourages it. There is nothing to gain from running on ahead and leaving others behind, you're all in this zombie apocalypse together. It's amazing how you can join a server with 3 random people and within the space of a couple of hours, get to know each of them well enough that you want to add them all to your friends list.\n\nMuch like GTA 5 or the Sims, this game has universal appeal. Yup, girls enjoy it too. I'm not going to say anything since I'll likely unintentionally come across as sexist, but I'll simply say that it's a testament to this game that everybody can enjoy it. I reckon that my parents would too if they would see past the gore.\n\nIt may look as though it's you versus zombies, but you're really up against 'The Director'. It is a mysterious, invisible force who decides where to leave weapons and items lying around in the level. If you're doing too well, it'll chuck a crowd of zombies at you. 'The Director' shapes the pacing and feeling of the game and makes each play-through different to the last. It adds enormous replayability to a game that's already bursting with features and game modes.\n\nOh yes, this game includes everything from the first game (rendering it completely obsolete), as well as 4 new characters with their own campaign spanning several separate worlds. You now have melee weapons, chainsaws, grenade launchers, vials-of-sick and deagles to aid you in your struggle against the undead. And The Director.\n\nBut don't worry- the zombies have some new tricks up their saggy-skin sleeves as well. You have 6 special infected who are a match for lone humans, as well as sitting and walking witches and the almighty tank. You have armoured zombies who can only be shot from the rear, mudmen who scuttle quickly below your vision and smear your view and industrial workers with shiny jackets that make them sitting ducks. Idiots.\n\nYou'll begin to fear the groan of the zombies. You'll get goosebumps at the sound of the musical cues. You'll love the sight of the saferoom and get a warm fuzzy feeling from using your medikit to heal a team member. This game has been a staple of my weekend nights for years and I'm still not tired of it. It's the perfect LAN game and as if the game wasn't good enough already, it also has a versus mode where you take in turns to be the special zombies and must stop the humans from achieving what ever it is those foolish creatures do when the world ends. I haven't played this mode nearly as much as I'd have liked and the idea of it still gets me excited all of these years later.\n\nIn terms of fun / exciting / scary / frustrating things that you can squeeze into an hour of gameplay, Left 4 Dead wins hands down. The only down-side? The community isn't what it used to be. It's a real shame when you look at the server list and find so few people still playing. Expert mode is nigh on impossible to complete without some old hardcore friends joining to lend you a hand. You can forget expert realism!\n\nEven without real people, you can still play the campaigns against bots. The game is still worth it for that alone, though of course it is better with other real people. Do yourself a favour if you haven't already and give this game a go. There really isn't anything as polished or as well designed as this game and Valve must be very proud of themselves for making it first.","November 25, 2013","true","264.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I DONT MIND PLAYING WITH THEM)\n\nWhat I have to say is the community (NOT ALL), this community is getting more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was playing this game awhile ago, I was playing a public modded server. I saved like 3-4 players when they are incap. And there are players who keeps friendly firing me when I was saving the incap ones. It's fine still.\n\nBut after I saved them, the players who friendly fired me voted to kick me. And everyone literally pressed F1. And I got voted out from the game, I saved people. And right after I got kicked, the players impersonated me. !@#$%&(*&^$#$% I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nSo..

The campaign missions are great to familiarize yourself with the maps, the settings, the gameplay, the different infected and their distinctive attacks. Everything balances itself out at every turn. But the real strength of this game is its multiplayer. You simply cannot experience the full force of Left 4 Dead, without having played its many multiplayer modes. There are so many different game possibilities and different objectives. It is one of the very few games that can keep me going for several hours, irrespective if i'm tired or sleepy - the adrenaline rush just keeps me awake and the feeling of satisfaction if you work well as a team is simply tremendous.\n\nThere are also private game servers which offer even more customizable game modes. The standard versus mode for the official game is 4 vs 4. But on third-party servers, you will encounter 10 vs 10, which changes the game by enabling more chaos and way more fun. I highly recommend that you try it if you ever get tired of the official game modes and want to try something new and even more exciting.","January 17, 2014","true","644.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

There are four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Advanced and Expert.\nVersus is the basic competitive mode for the Left 4 Dead series: two separate teams of four players take turns playing as the Survivors and the Infected competing for the most points.\nThe point of Survival Mode is to hold out for the longest time, with times being saved and virtual medals being awarded for surviving for certain amounts of time.\nScavenge is a competitive gameplay mode in Left 4 Dead 2. It is a round based game in which Survivors have a limited amount of time to find up to 21 gas cans to fuel up a generator (or car), while fighting against player-controlled Special Infected much like in a Versus game.\nAs in the first game, each scenario is presented like a movie. At the start of the game there is a movie poster showing the cast. At the end the "credits" display the statistics for the game, like who killed the most zombies, who inflicted the most headshots and so on. The final credit shows how many zombies were killed in the making of the film and also the film is dedicated to the memory of those survivors who did not make it to safety.\nEvery aspect of Left 4 Dead has been refined and tweaked to perfection. It has brilliant graphics and a nice cinematic feel.\nThe new campaigns and unique game modes offer more variety and more longevity, while all the other additions and tweaks make the already great gameplay even more enjoyable. Even the AI has improved a little bit, and while they still aren't big on using pipe bombs or Molotovs and are prone to missteps, they seem to have a better grasp of tactics and will follow you a bit more closely.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosie15/recommended/550/","rosie15","Razzledgirl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosie15/","217 products in account","Alright, I think I'm finally due for a review...\nBack in 2008, Left 4 Dead caught my eye.  The idea of zombies, (How original, amirite, although It was a bit newer back then.) slicing their heads off, blowing off their legs with pipe bombs, and listening to them die to fire sounded freaking AWESOME.  So I pre-ordered it.  (I was a console peasant back then)\nLet's just say it ruined my life in a very, very bad *ahem* good way..\n\nBy the time Left 4 Dead 2 was announced in 2009, I had already skipped school so many times continuing was probably pointless.  I hadn't seen my family more than for dinners in months and oh god was it so good. (I'm regretting it now, don't worry.)  So I pre-ordered it again.  (PEASANT.  ;_;)\nWell yet again I lost my life.  Left 4 Dead probably was the cause of me dropping out of school twice.  And you know, the xbox community (this is back when there were people actually playing) actually wasn't half bad, or so I thought.\n\nBOOM.  I have a computer.  Got both the games.  Didn't play 1 much, as I've already played way too much of it.  Left 4 dead 2 Scavenge mode was my absolute favorite on xbox, and now on PC even more so.  Versus I didn't want to get into, as in Left 4 Dead 1 I played way too much of it and got burnt out.  I learned so many new things and tricks that you just couldn't possibly do on a controller.  I met new friends, and with the lovely (xx hours in the last 2 weeks) tracker, I stopped playing so frickin' much.  (okay, sometimes.) The community here, even if it is filled with a bunch of cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, is obviously, better.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.   If you're looking for a good zombie game to play, this one is great.  It's so simple, yet there is always room for improvement.  I doubt many people don't own it these days, as its always on frickin' sell.  If you don't have it, buy it already.\n\nJust a few tips:\nLearn the infected classes.  Like how the hunter needs to crouch before he can pounce in some way or another (more complicated moves are saved for later), and other stuff having to do with the infected.\nThis game is team based.  Your teammates matter.  If your teammates are struggling, help them, unless you are absolutely better off going alone (I can only think of a few scenarios).  If your teammates can't cover you and you're 'MLG PRO B@$$' don't be all 'g3t on my l3v37 n00b', switch freaking places with them.  That's your only hope.  You don't go solo here.\nSame with infected.  Don't go solo.  Unless you're amazing and its a death charge, just don't.  You time your attacks accordingly, and work together to achieve the best results.\nRemember, all of the best teams you will ever run into in Left 4 Dead 2 certaintly know that working together is essential.  They just do it better than us.\nUse a mic + headphones / headset at all times.  Most people will get very annoyed if they can hear your game through your microphone, and let me tell you, trying to play a team based game with a mute person is not fun.\nSHOOT ALL THE THINGS.\nGameplay Modes:\nCampaign\nStart by playing Campaign, either Solo or with friends.  Learn the controls up and down, & attempt to get the general rhythm of playing as a Survivor.\nYou can either play campaign solo with single player and computer controlled teammates, or you can play Co Op.  I strongly preferred Co Op, as single player can be boring.  It is much funner to play while you joke about with your friends.  We have a few difficulties, start from Easy and work your way up.  Or, screw it all and play expert for the lulz!  I know I did that a few times with some friends, and it was hilarious.\n\nSurvival\nPlay Survival for fun sometimes, its frustrating as you WILL die, but play it with your friends, and it will help you learn how to play as a team.\nThis gamemode is generally you and three other survivors duking it out on the map of your choice, against an endless horde of zombies and special infected.  The special infected are computer controlled.\n\nYou can play this alone or with teammates, but it's pointless without teammates.  This gamemode is great not only for trying to achieve an amazing time and the pure fun of that (and rage), but also because it will help improve your team working skills.  This is important.\n\nVersus\nWhen you feel like you understand the Infected classes and you feel comfortable playing as a team.\nIn this game mode two teams of four go head to head.  One starts as Survivor, one as Infected.  The general goal as an infected is to kill the other team as fast as you can while working together, or if you are on the Survivor side, to make it to the end with all of your teammates alive.  Each time a section of a map ends, you replay that map as the other class.  Whichever team has the most points at the end wins.\n\nIf you can, get a few friends together for a large versus game, where you won't run into a bunch of cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't remember they were new once too.  Otherwise, ♥♥♥♥ em' and just try to hold your own in a versus game.  You may get kicked, but don't let it get you down.  It's okay to make mistakes, that's how we learn, that is how we all learned.  Some people just forget that little fact.\n\nScavenge\nWhen you feel like you understand the Infected classes and you feel comfortable playing as a team.\nThis game mode is like versus.  Except you play on one map, and one map only, for a number of rounds.  The point as the Survivors is to fill the generator on the map with gas cans, and the gas cans will be spread out across the map (easily visible, so no worries there).  On the other hand, the infected are trying to stop you.  They want you to either not get all the cans, or to get them all very, very slow.\nYou switch back and forth and the winner of each round is determined by either who gets the most cans, or if it's a tie, whichever team got them all the quickest.\n\nAhh, the game mode that sucked me in and took my life from me.  Scavenge is really fun.  But be warned, a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chill in this gamemode.  Brush yo' shoulder off.\n\nMutations\nWhenever.\nFun gamemodes that you can and should play with your friends.  You can play them alone too, though.  I haven't played them all so I don't think I can accurately portray them, but they are fun.\n\nRealism & Realism Versus\nRealism is campaign but on crack.  You can't see each other through walls anymore, you're basically relying on each other to stick together.  Other aspects of the gameplay are hard too, like zombies taking more damage.  Great team building gamemode.\n\nRealism Versus is basically versus with realism thrown in it ^ (read above)","September 19, 2014","true","177.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","4"

The sequel not only provides a new setting (one with more character when compared to the original), new characters, new weapons and new enemies, but entirely new gameplay mechanics. It feels fresh and new and yet at the same time, comfortingly familiar.\n\nL4D2 is an improvement over the original in almost every aspect. But it fails somewhat in one major aspect, it just doesn't feel as magical or expertly crafted as its predecessor.","April 17, 2011","true","351.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

In almost every way L4D2 replicates it's predecessor and surpasses it at the same time.\n\nL4D2 unlike it's predecessor has maps that take place during the day. It features more special infected that require constant movement and cover. And it features melee weapons that add an entirely new dynamic to gameplay. All of these features are woven very well with the carried over elements from L4D1. The game still requires players stick together inorder to avoid being pounced by legions of undead and it keeps the frantic fast paced atmosphere. Alongside that, the game's versus mode adds a great deal of strategy to the gameplay. And lastly it's survival mode allows players to test their skills and provide a nice healthy amount of competition amongst each other.\n\nI'd go as far as to say L4D2 now is one of Valve's best attempts at multiplayer games on the Source engine. Harder, Faster, Better and Stronger in almost every way.","March 9, 2014","true","116.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","3"

The characters and story are very believable and weapons and gameplay are for the most part excellently balanced. On top of this there is workshop support which means endless fun and mayhem in LFD2.\n\nBut unfortunately, this is heavily tainted. The only problem I have with this game is the god awful and poisonous community which inhabits it's every nook and cranny. Some people who play this game are downright mean and clearly have something wrong with them.\n\nMost of these are so called 'Pros' and veteran players who infect the game community like cancer.

I was hesitant because it was a zombie game and I didn't handle well in the Call of Duty: Nazi Zombies game. After I bought it, I noticed very quickly that this game makes friends FAST! It promotes teamwork between 4 players known as survivors, as they try to make it to the CEDA extraction point.\n\nSpecifically, this story follows Nick, Ellis, Coach, and Rochelle. Each character has a personality of their own, unlike Gordon Freeman or Chell from other Valve games.\n\nNick was a gambler, according to the commentary, he looted his white suit to survive in style. He often sounds stern, and serious about their situation. As in Dark Carnival he says in response to Coach and Ellis's excitement, "Now we can die there as adults."\n\nEllis is a child at heart, and he is known as the mechanic of the group. If the player stays in the safehouses long enough, Ellis will tell a tale from his pre-apocolyptic life with his friend Keith. He is very happy about anything, and no he's not crazy, he still hates zombies. He's a native to Georgia which is where the story takes place.\n\nCoach is sort of a mix between Ellis and Nick, he is serious at times and at other times, like in Dark Carnival, he can be quite happy. I actually don't know much about his character, but I do know that he also is native to Georgia.\n\nRochelle is commonly known by the community as the one with the annoying laugh. She is caring towards Ellis and often refers to him as "sweety" when he trails off on one of his stories. I don't know much about her either, but she is mainly for the girl gamers to play as.\n\nThis game also brings the four together with the original four survivors Bill, Francis, Louis, and Zoey. This happens in The Passing. The game also is appealing because it adds L4D1 campaigns too, so you've got plenty of levels to entertain yourself. The important thing is that the game has amazing replay value! Just beating the levels isn't enough to wear out this game!\n\nYou also can't forget the workshop, which adds campaigns, survivors, weapons, and zombies that can change the game in dramtic ways!","August 19, 2014","true","342.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","3"

It's very difficult to finish a Versus match without having the cancerous community kick you.

Playing by yourself is another thing. You will be kicked constantly- often for no reason at all. I actually found myself kicked for healing one teammate over the other(who were both in the same shape).\n\nSave your money and time- this game's horrid community will anger you if you decide to play alone, as it did for me.

What i like so much about valve games is the amount of time the valve developers spend on perfecting all the tiny details that shape the universe from their games which makes left 4 dead 2 a little special.\n\nBut as nice as this game is i have a few things that worry me. Even though the game itself is a jewel worth playing in more than one way, in the various lobbies i created i keep running into people who join the team but only care for themir own needs. They don themselves as experts or pros or even both sometimes but in reality all that ever happens is that these players start rushing the maps while other players nomatter how often they have played this game don't get a proper oppertunity to get a taste of the athmosphere and as a result get isolated from the rest.\n\nIn some cases you even get an immature big fat mouth from them when things don't go their way. It's a problem i have noticed eversince i started playing this game. Needless to say in time my preferance for short plays in spare time went over from co-op to using the standard bots which i really regret but is a problem i often hear from the gamers i know.\n\nWith that in mind we can all jump high or low about it but it is the way it is. The best i can recommend is to play this game with good friends because let's be honest that's what you have friends for. Especially with left 4 dead 2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelastbinderbender/recommended/550/","thelastbinderbender","Ness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelastbinderbender/","391 products in account","Before posting this review, it thought: "hey, let's have a look to the negative comments to see wha- wait. What the hell is this?"\nPeople complain about it having bad graphics, crashing when starting, not being suited to be classified to survival, or horror, etc, etc. I mean, seriously.\n\nFirst of all, Left 4 Dead is an awesome game about TEAMWORK. Yes, teamwork. I see people complaining about being kicked from versus. Playtime: 1-2 hours. What do you expect when you don't know how to play properly? I'm not saying I'm a pro, but it's been blood and sweat to become decent at this game, running it on a crappy notebook, at 10-15 fps on hordes. You can do better than complaining on reviews. You could actually play the game. Learn how to share first-aids, pills, adrenalines, use defibs, when to use stuff. That's only learned by playing campaings, watching gameplays and so on.\n\nSecondly, before buying a game, the best you can do is find a torrent and download it; watch gameplays on YouTube, read critics on the internet, and then try it on your own. If you like it, buy it. If you don't like it, don't. If you got it free, then don't complain unless it's useful. There are lots of ways to try a game before buying it.\n\nLastly, people complain about online players being rude and mostly rage quitters. This is not completely true. However, I do agree that the community is not as warming and welcoming as it used to be. This is because the amount of players playing it has increased considerably, leading to people who cannot handle losing, people who consider themselves gods of L4D2, etc. Is this only their fault, though? I highly doubt it. People who complain about others mistreating them, usually tend to hide the fact that it might also be their fault. It's not hard to say "could anyone help me, I'm new on this game". It's not hard to make friends on this game. I have made lots of them playing versus, and my friends too. It's about the attitude towards how you behave against others.\n\nL4D2 is a great game. Enjoyable. A bit repetitive. But what game isn't after playing it for 80+ hours. Tell me RPGs are not about killing monsters over and over again, or others FPS are about killing guys, looting stuff, etc. Think before posting a review. Is it your game crashing? There are forums where you can post your problem. Is it that you didn't like it because of unknown reasons? Give good reasons stating the facts that make it bad. But most important, change your attitude towards the game, and online players. I'm not speaking only for newcomers, but also for those so-called pros who mistreat newcomers on versus.","February 9, 2014","true","347.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inkystring/recommended/550/","inkystring","Inky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inkystring/","981 products in account","Many people love L4D2, following the incredible success of L4D.\nPersonally, I think this game is a heap of ♥♥♥♥ - and I love just about every other Valve game.\nTechnically and graphically, it is better than L4D, and unfortunately, that's the only part it is better. In everything else, it stinks.\n\nGone is the atmosphere, the friendly rivalry between Louis and Francis, the grainy 70's film effect (seriously, wtf were you thinking), dark brooding cityscapes, and the witty repartee between all four members.\nInstead, you get four unlikeable characters that spend more time whining and ♥♥♥♥♥ing at each other, bright sunny days in New Orleans, and near constant waves of zombies.\nIn fact, that is the main thing that irks me about the sequel. In the first one, if you had a strong member of the team, there was a fair chance they could pull the the rest of the team through, which made for some hectic, but fun, gameplay.\nIn L4D2, there is no chance of that. The waves are too relentless and the specials spawn far too frequently, so if the team is a little disorganised, you're ♥♥♥♥ed with a capital F.\nOnce the game decides it is going to target you, that's it until you either run of medkits or the team gets tired of trying to protect you. More often that not, you're spawning back at the safehouse, because one player got boomed, jockeyed and then incapped in the spitter goo.\nCue ragequitting from less invested members of the team. The fun factor just shines through at that point (/sarcasm)\n\nI've tried hard to like this game, really I have.\nGod knows I've put enough hours into it, but I just can't bring myself to like it in any way shape or form. In fact, I've gone from trying to like it to hating it, and have completely removed it off my PC. If I could delete it from my Steam library, I would.\n\nL4D may have had it's flaws, but it certainly had atmosphere and characters you could warm to, and my final verdict is that L4D2 does not hold a candle to it.\nTo sum it up - in the first game, you felt like you were all fighting against hordes of zombies.\nIn the second one, it feels like you are fighting everything in the game - zombies, weather, terrain - some maps are just a slow grindingly weary slog from start to finish.\n\nIt's cheap enough to pick up for a bit of fun, and you might like it, but I seriously can't recommend it when the preceding game was far FAR superior in gameplay.","June 5, 2014","false","209.4"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","22","34","0","3"

The only thing I see as a negative aspect is that the game is very simple, I mean, all you need to do is moving to point A to point B while killing zombies. The workshop compensates every negative aspect of the game, you can download mods called "mutations" that improves the game and makes it more enjoyable.

A simple system that's easy for first time players to learn, yet complex to offer late game masters something to calculate with. Balanced enemies, spawn rates, weapons, movements, HP system, and ammo capacity. Can be as challenging, easy, or unforgiving as you want. Well tailored to any and all players.\n\n-Level design: Environments are diverse and uniquely pathed to offer a different feel and strategy per level. Spawns and item placements are mostly randomized, yet still manages to make use of every corner of the maps. Direction and pace of play is linear, but never gets old or burdensome.\n\n-Multiplayer: Fast connections, great server support, one button in game press to check your signal strength.

Also, the custom campaigns from the workshop add a boost of entertaining and the scavenge on the rooftop from No Mercy map is very awesome. The plot is simple because all you need to do is to go from a safe house to another killing everything which is in your way. I spent on over 2k hours on and the price is worth it, that's why i highly suggest everyone who's interested in good content should try this.\nIt has its ups and downs. You can basically meet all sorts of people in the community, nicer or less nicer, from where you can choose to play further. This is why it's very competitive. From time to time, you can experience minor bugs but they don't downgrade the experience.\nIn conclusion, I give this game 10/10, one of the best old games out there!","November 23, 2015","true","696.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

Just pure fun.\n- Mods are welcomed (have your own style of the apocalypse).\n- YOU CAN BE THE INFECTED! Now that is fun.\n- Can be played with potato PCs.\n\nCons:\n- Item physics are wobbling and act like light plastic (most especially the gas cans).\n- AI Survivors were designed to just shoot and pick up items (ammunitions to be specific). They are not designed to interact with certain objects given by the map.\n- Some weapons that are available at the game files are not accessible in the game (eg; AWP).\n\nRATING: 9/10 would shoot alarmed cars again.","May 16","true","49.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","2"

Swarm full of zombies and a variety of 8 special infected to kill or play with. Each survivor has their own personality & lingo to them that will keep you entertained throughout the game when taking down the zombies. I see this title an inspiration to games that shows its not all about the graphics but the potiental that many cant conflict on. When i mean by the potiental is the gameplay its self, its always going to be a challenge to master, no matter how long you play it. It has many features to offer from weapons, to game modes for certain players with different taste E.g (Campaign/Realism/VS/Survival/Mutation)\n\nI have all do respect to the co-devlopers Valve for bringing out as much features for the Left 4 Dead community such as: L4D1 Campaigns, new DLC such as the Passing, Sacrfice & Cold stream for free. Workshop amendments for users that would like to create and download mods from authors content. Thats just to show that its not all about the money in the gaming industry but the respect valve has for the gamers. So I thank you valve for what you have offered.\n\nI would reccomend this game to the players that enjoy frantic and non-stop action shooters.

It's sometimes on sale for only a few dollars, and on occasion has even been free for a weekend or Christmas.\n\nThe best co-op game I've ever played, hands down. I spent nearly a thousand hours playing campaign mode before even dipping a toe into Versus or Scavenge game modes. These (competitive) multiplayer modes are very fun also, but be aware that you will be expected to have mastered the learning curve BEFORE jumping into these - your teammates will expect you to know the game already, and there's virtually no on-the-job training, so to speak. ;)\n\nL4D2 includes pretty much all the content of L4D1, and a bunch more besides - 4 new survivors, 3 new Special Infected, 5 new campaigns, new "uncommon infected" specific to these new campaigns, and new player-usable items in every category. Plus an add-on workshop to customize your game when it finally starts feeling stale. In terms of play hours per dollar spent, no other game I have EVER played comes close.\n\nSo if you're wondering whether to get this game? Get it, especially if you can get it on sale. Even if you only play it a bit and put it aside for other things, you'll probably be glad you have it in your library to play with friends occasionally.","August 18, 2015","true","203.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoamRifle/recommended/550/","FoamRifle","Foamy the Fearsome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoamRifle/","77 products in account","Left 4 Dead 2 is a nice zombie-shooter/survival game with - contrary to most other zombieshooters - actually has swift action and therewith a tense and interesting playstyle. For instance, the zombies in this game can run, which eliminates the main reason for other zombie games to be rather static and dull. Comes with a variety of playmodes and maps for every different skill level, from rookie to tryhard.\n\nThe main problem with this game is its community; especially when playing the Versus mode, unskilled teammates are very often frowned upon. Teamwork IS essential in this game and therefore one bad or really slow player (or troll) can offset an entire match, but in my opinion, the votekick option is overused, as well as verbal raging on newcomers or people that do not play on a regular basis. Competitiveness and 'playing for fun' is unbalanced, as most Versus games you'll play are either against a premade group of 4 pros, against a group of random newcomers, a group of ragequitters OR a combination of those: the middle level for the average, mediocre player seems to have faded away and close games are almost impossible to get, unless you have 2 pro teams against each other.\n\nPros:\n- Fun gameplay with tense action that requires full concentration\n- Well thought out characters with good voice acting\n- Has a good variety of game modes that keep the game interesting for a long time\n- Sound effects and music add to the 'scary' or 'horror' factor of the game in a very positive way\n- Has the right mixture between gore effects and unrealisticly exaggerated images that make it attractive to the gore-lovers, but not too scary for younger kids to play\n\nCons:\n- Overly competitive community; not really the place for the individual gamer, the newcomer or the casual player (unless you play with friends, in that case its still great)\n- Despite having several game modes, everything is played on a limited amount of maps (although I have to say, there's plenty of addons available to make up for this, and it will still manage to keep your interest for quite a long time)\n- When playing on Single Player, the AI have a lot of bugs that can result in unnecessary deaths (like getting stuck in a certain routine or prioritising the saviour of another AI that is incapacitated MILES AWAY) which can get REALLY frustrating if it happens in repetition.\n\nOverall its a good game and I'd most certainly recommend it to those who like to play casually with their friends, or competitive on a high level.\nRating: 7.5/10","December 20, 2014","true","952.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WufeiChang/recommended/550/","WufeiChang","Wufei Chang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WufeiChang/","43 products in account","This updated review is directed to those considering buying this game at the time of a sale.\n\nIf you have not checked my profile, you will see that I have more than 4,800 hours at the time of this review.  There is a good reason for that, I can tell you this game is fun for anyone who wants to shoot zombies/infected.  Unlike other zombie games, You get to actually play as the infected against player-controlled survivors and vice versa.  It is even more fun when playing with friends in against an equally-skilled opposing team.\n\nThis game features and abundance of assorted games modes and mutations (which are sames modes but with varied tweaks) perfect for just about anyone.  If you are new, go to forums and find some new players such as yourself and add them as your friend.  Play with those friends in the campaign mode to learn the game and its infected.  Practice playing as the infected in Versus Survival mutation mode.\n\nBEWARE,  IF YOU JUMP straight into Versus/Scavenge competitive modes before actually earning experience in a lot of campaign games, you will be met with a somewhat unwelcoming community that will vote kick you.  As with any game, you have to learn the basics before trying to go into the competitive (Versus/Scavenge) modes.  There is a good reason for this (despite the community having a bad reptuation), a infected team will exploit any weakness the other team has: be it a new player with inexperience, a slow-progressing person, or player with incomplete understanding about the game mechanics.  It is the fact that player infected can think tactically and combine their attacks whereas bot-controlled infected in campaign will go attack one-by-one but not all the time.\n\nAs a new player, the vote kicking feature will seem like your worst enemy and will even turn you off and disregard this game (A lot of silly forum threads because of these reasons).  But after awhile, you will learn that this feature is necessary as it removes AFKs, Griefers (Teamkillers/glitchers), and inexperienced players (sadly).  Remember that there is no rank system in place and therefore you will be placed with veteran players easily in Versus.  Getting dominated quickly is no fun nor is it fun for your teammates.  Strangers in versus will rant on you for single mistake (which is wrong) but one mistake on infected can mean 400 easy points to the opposing survivor team.  Likewise one mistake can mean your entire survivor team falls and unable to aquire points. In campaign you can retry to complete the map but in Versus YOU DON'T.\n\nIt would be great if you brought over experience from the xbox version of this game. BUT!! keep in mind, the standards of playing ARE MUCH higher here than on xbox.  I played xbox for the longest time before coming to pc, and I noticed one thing.  Survivors can aim a lot better than their xbox equilivents. So in xbox, the infected have the upper hand and are able to do damage even if attacking alone.  But in this PC version, attacking alone as infected will get you killed easily (you will be lucky to get close to a group bunched together).  Xbox only tranfers over: map layouts, item usage, and gameplay mechanics.\n\nUnlike Resident Evil games, you will have to work with your teammates to succeed here.  Remember this is a co-operative game, you are playing as normal survivor and NOT some superhuman charater like in Resident Evil or Dead Rising games.  You cannot LONE WOLF it in Competitive modes, (theres a mutation game mode for those kinds of players)\n\nAs time passed, the game introduced the Workshop. This allows you to customized your game to whatever you want.  Add some mods, character skins, custom music, visuals, whatever. It changes the look of the game to what you want but only you will see it though.  Example: you can change the survivors to anime characters or change the infected look, etc.\n\nFinally, remember this game requires communication so I suggest you get a HEADSET or microphone but it is not really neccessary.  Play with friends and take time to learn the game.  Remember your version of ''Fun'' may not be the same as the your teammates so you can't just play the competitive modes and expect your team accept your shortcomings unless they are on your friends list.\n\nIGN Quote : "Ultimately, enjoyment derived from this game depends on you are playing with and how you are playing."....."this is very social minded game that really plays of human nature..."","January 16, 2014","true","872.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Looking to survive the apocalypse?  This first person shooter game maybe the key to all mankind.\n\nThe great thing about this game is the versatility as well as the variety of zombie attacks.  You can go from story line by yourself to with your friends or even with strangers.  There are various levels such as easy, normal, advanced and campaign.  But that's not all.  There are more game modes that will keep you interested!\n\nFight in multiplayer cooperative games such as survival to see how long you can last.  Best part about it, you never win... you always die!  Go more into depth with the game and become infected with your teammates and attack the other teams in versus or savenge.\n\nWhat did you say? The game is too easy?  Try it out in realism.  This game mode does not give you help like glowing ammo or items.  They don't even tell you where your friends are.  Like in real life, you have to find where they are for yourself!\n\nWith Mutations, you have a set of rules or variations of the game you play by... so if you are looking for a harder version of survival... Nightmare may be your answer... Want to shoot all zombies with a M60? No problem! Gibs fest will grant that.\n\nAll these are fun and dandy, but the game wouldn't be the game that it is without 3rd party server hosts, dedicated and casual players as well as contributors to the steamworkshop where you can add more maps, skins and textures to your game by subscribing to the item so you have the newest updates for those items as well!. :)\n\nWe long for a LFD3, but as the game continuously grow with players and mods from the workshop things can get quite...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWACS-Jason/recommended/550/","AWACS-Jason","AWACS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWACS-Jason/","110 products in account","Left 4 Dead 2 is a game where four survivors attempt to survive and escape the zombie horde.\nIf they survive or not, is up to you, and how you play.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 manages to be fast-paced in a genre of slow zombie survivals, but it also still manages to retain the tense and stressful nature of the rest of the zombie games. There is no aim down sights in the game, unless you are using a sniper rifle, similar to the rest of Valve's games. Another thing in line with the rest of Valve's work is the lack of regenerating health. In Left 4 Dead 2, players must use first aid kits in order to heal themselves, with adrenaline shots and painkillers acting as 'temporary' health. Much of your survival depends on how well you utilize your first-aid...\n\nDo you save it in case something goes wrong, do you use it on someone else, or do you use it like it's the last chance you'll ever get...? Will you ever find more down the road?\n\nThese are the questions you'll quickly ask yourself and the rest of your party as you try to make it through.\n\nOther than the healing items, there are various other items to keep an eye out for as well. Pipe bombs, molotovs, and even a jar of bile. Pipe bombs draw standard zombies to them with a loud beeping sound and a bright red light. In Left 4 Dead, loud sounds will attract zombies, and the pipe bomb in particular will keep them away from you, and will eventually kill them when it explodes. The molotov is a simple but effective weapon in keeping the horde away, it puts down a field of fire and it burns enemies. The last item is the bile jar. It attracts the horde to anything you throw it at, and they'll stay on it for a while, killing whatever it happens to land on. Even other zombies.\n\nThe jar is filled with the insides of a boomer, one of the special infected of the game.\nThe special infected of Left 4 Dead 2 are zombies with unique abilities that will prove deadly to survivors, and will require cooperation or a skilled shot to take down. Perhaps both..\n\nThe Boomer is a large zombie that vomits on survivors. This attracts the horde of generic zombies to attack them. However, if the survivors are not careful in dispatching the boomer, it will explode on death and splatter on the survivors, turning a situation from bad to worse.\n\nThe Hunter is a fast and agile zombie with a normal body frame, making it slightly harder to distinguish than other special infected when running. However, when it gets into a crouching position, it pounces on survivors and claws them until they die. It can pounce from very high locations to do extra damage, or it can ambush survivors from unexpected places. The Hunter wears a hoodie, and growls when getting ready to attack, screaming loudly when pouncing.\n\nThe Smoker is a tall zombie that coughs a lot. That's why you don't smoke, because then you'll get lungs like this guy.\nAnyways, the smoker has long reach, allowing it to pull survivors around, and into dangerous positions. Smokers will try to pull you into a car alarm to draw the horde to you, or they will try to pull you to another special infected so they can try to pick off another survivor, or maybe they'll just pull a survivor off a ledge, either getting them stuck holding it for their life, or forcing the victim to run all the way back to their group.\n\nThe Tank is a large, massive, and powerful zombie that can kill the entire group if left unchecked. They have huge muscles, which makes them an easy target, but it also represents their strength. One punch from a tank, and you'll fly several feet away from the rest of the survivors, and, on high difficulties, it could even end you in one hit. They can even toss rubble at the survivors, giving them a range option, as well as already being lethal in close quarters.\n\nThe Jockey is a small zombie, he runs fairly quickly and jumps on survivors, 'riding' them away into danger.\n\nThe Spitter is a taller type of special infected that spits acid onto survivors, being an effective long range unit that can deny an area to the survivors, or flush them out. Spitters also drop a pool of acid when they die, making them a bit more dangerous to deal with, especially when you are being pressured by a large amount of zombies.\n\nThe Charger is a large zombie that literally charges survivors. They run at the survivors with full speed and once they pick up a target, they continue running for a while, or until they hit something. This makes them very dangerous in situations where they can thrust you off of a dangerous height, or if there's deep water, because they can sacrifice themselves and take you with them.\n\nNow, we've covered all of the special infected, and there's also uncommon infected as well, but I won't go over them here in order to save some space, and they aren't too important anyways.\n\nThe gunplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is very easy to get used to. From assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, melee weapons, snipers, and even grenade launchers, players should find it simple to point and shoot at zombies. Headshots are obviously more rewarding, as it will kill them zombie faster, and you'll save some ammo too. There are different deployable ammo types as well, which have different properties. High explosive, for example, will explode!\n\nIn Left 4 Dead 2, there are events in the game where you have to do something very loud in order to progress, but they draw a LOT of attention. These are called 'Crescendo Events'. These actions cause a massive attack from the infected, and require the survivors to defend themselves until the action is completed. Some events are gauntlet styled, which require survivors to run, rather than wait. Zombies will keep spawning in these gauntlet styled events, so it's best to move quickly. Also, at the jukebox, there's a song that plays and it says 'All we wanna do is eat your brains', which will also spawn enemies.\n\nWhen a survivor dies, you can rescue them in closets through the game, or revive them with a defibrillator. However, you can rescue them before that and revive them when they are down. Going down too often without using first aid will result in death, which can be noted when the screen turns grey. Some game modes disable spawning, so it may be suited for super serious players.\n\nAt the end of every campaign, there is a final chapter, a finale.\nIn the end, survivors hold out until rescue arrives, and this is the last stand for the campaign.\nWhoever dies here, is dead at the end, and at least one survivor must escape.\nBeing prepared is extremely important here, as it will require determination from all survivors.\nOccasionally, the finale will also require the survivors run through another 'gauntlet' styled attack, except the finales are far more dangerous than the standard events, featuring more enemies and lots of special infected.\n\nI recommend getting the game for CO-OP, it's great at what it does, which is being a great CO-OP experience.\nFor the single players, I honestly have trouble with recommending this game because there simply isn't enough to justify getting it just to play with the AI. The AI is extremely dumb, and they have HORRIBLE reaction times, occasionally letting you take massive amounts of damage before they save you, and not bothering to shoot the special infected, but instead they try to melee them when they are on you, making them waste valuable seconds needed to save your life. There's also not really a real 'story', other than backstories about the survivors and backstories about the other stuff around you. While some people have grown into the characters of L4D, I personally have not cared about any one of them enough to feel connected with the game itself. The soundtrack is also not really worth mentioning, in my opinion. It has a nice attempt at trying to place a dark feeling, but it's simply average at best. Gameplay also becomes monotonous without friends and workshop content, but you'll get a lot of replayability\n","June 14, 2015","true","52.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","6"

Don't expect a warm greeting in versus mode if you're new to the game and have little experience and skill.

The game itsef is not much like classic zombies where survival is the top priority, instead its more of a first person shooter, where landing your shots and have sharp senses will many times decide your fate. Getting infected is not a thing as the survivors in this game cannot turn. Zombies are so weak and so fragile, they there simply to slow you down. The real game is between the survivors and the special infected, mutated zombies variants, that use they multiple habilities to kill the survivors, and as they are the only ones that can be controled by humans, its a game of teamwork where the best team wins, in a 4vs4 versus game action. Now the worse part, the commnuity, you will always seem to find yourself stuck in the same situation, in a game with 3 other people in campaign where one of them starts to shoot everyone and leave, or in a versus game where your team joins and leaves, changing faster than you can keep up, while the other team is alwasy the same 4 people, just spamming, bringing up excuses evertime ur attack is sucessfull, and scream at you full force and CAPS LOCK with no regrets every swear word in the english dictionary everytime you survive they combined attack. You will be invited to a lot of Get owned groups and You suck, your mother will get insulted a lot in every language you can possibly imagine, and your teammates leaving you faster than rats in a sinking ship, but if, and only if, you luck out and find yourself great friends, you will enjoy this game for all its worth it.\n8/10 The best zombie game to play with friends, the worst game to play alone.","April 5","true","554.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

There are not just zambees but a huge variety of them like, smokers, those monkey zombies, and these chargers who run right into you and have way too much health. This game is fun and I recommend it. This has to be one of my favorite Co op games. The second reason that makes this game so special is that this game requires a lot of teamwork. If someone has low health and they don't have a med kit, you should heal them. Or when people are about to fall from a ledge help them up and when people are lying on the ground, you should try to revive them. The more people you have, the quicker you get the job done.\n\nThe only negatives to this game is L4D community. If you are AFK for a little bit, they kick you. Another example is that if you're trying to save yourself but this other person is being attacked and is low on health, they hate you for not helping them out. I've had an instance where a guy had to leave and then a new person replaced him. The other player in the game was being whiny and really wanted to kick him because he want the other player back. One of the biggest things that ♥♥♥♥ the hell out of me are the players in scavenge. They kick you almost all of the time if you are not helping the team. This is a few of the reasons why I hate Valve. But this rarely bothers me or anyone if you are good at this game. 8/10 And oh god is the Witch creepy!","December 21, 2014","true","139.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

In normal games you just have to believe in their skill, but Left 4 Dead 2 changes all of that with The Witch. She won’t hurt you if you don’t bother her. You could just walk past her, wave a bit, and be on your way. That is, assuming your friend isn’t a backstabbing pile of filth.\n\nYou’re playing over Steam (obviously) and chatting like old drinking buddies when your friend suddenly goes quiet. "No," you plead with yourself as you hear the strained breathing of someone about to pull off a devious prank. Your friend's character slowly turns--it’s probably Coach--and raises his gun. The world is quiet. Then in one split second he fires at The Witch and your whole team is dead. The quiet returns, this time accompanied by your once-friend’s crazed laughter. They got you! Man what a jib. Yeah, screw you dude.

Left 4 Dead 2 is the best place for you. Four survivors with an arsenal of weapon ranging from chainsaw to M60 and lots and lots of Infected trying to hunt you down.\n\nL4D2 picks up where the first game left off, only with new survivors to hunt and be hunted. The short story of the game is spread through 5 chapters (although it was expanded with DLC campaigns). It is not overtly complicated and deep, but it can be suspected for a game of this nature and fairly this is not the most important part of this game. On normal settings the campaign can be completed around 4 hours or so, if you have access to the DLC campaigns it will extend the fun to 6-7 hours. Amping up the difficulty will increase the challenge and frustration originating from the retries you have to take to complete the chapters. While the story is not the richest out there, the game features some amazing voice over and writing. The characters are funny, witty and believable -- in the world of the game of course.\n\nWhen you (if you at all) breeze through the campaign with bots this is when the real fun begins. Online multiplayer is its name. Simply, this game is meant to be played with other humans. First of all, the AI is not horrible, bud it is bad enough that you will be constantly ripping out your hair while playing the game SP (especially on harder difficulties) Not to mention the Infected AI is much better. Second, the shooting is at its best when you are surrounded with real humans trying to help you survive or chasing you as Infected. Yes, there are game modes (Versus, Scavange, etc.) where you can show your skills as a Spitter, Charger or any type of Special Infected.\n\nThe challenges will just never end with this game. You can play different MP modes like Versus or the newly introduced Scavange (collecting cans and filling up the generator while the Infected are trying to stop you). Or if you want you can just play the campaigns again with human help. If you are tired you can jump on community servers or try the endless number of easy-to-use mods created for the game by the community.\n\nHere we are again. Valve have proved again that they are indeed the masters of Multiplayer Madness. After hits like Counter Strike, Team Fortress we have the upcoming wave of games like the L4D2 series and DotA 2. While the SP mode is not much engaging and falls short of expectations and you may not care about the characters in the end, if you ever want to just jump in and oppose the endless hordes of zombies while having super fun, this is the ultimate and most definite place to start.\n\nRating: 85/100; Replay Value: 5/5; To Beat: 6 hours (SP - with the campaign DLCs); Played on: normal.","July 27, 2013","true","249.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Even if I would want, I can't recommend L4D2 over L4D1. I'm gonna skip the community thing as often players are behaving like bunch of idiots even outside of game (vide forums etc.) so I think it doesn't worth any commentary as it won't save this game.\nDespite having more hours played in sequel, when I bought L4D1 I felt like I'm playing completely different game. In my opinion it's the L4D1 which looks like finished product, more polished, way less glitched and annoying with its gameplay mechanics. Everytime I turn on L4D2 I see idiotic Survivors animations, ugly flying pistols and unbellevable amount of melee weapons and SMGs, like game wanting to say „C'mon, don't pretend to be a hero, just take that axe and run like idiot – I'm gonna kill you anyway during next Crescendo Event if you won't drop your pistols”. I don't say L4D1 is easier – maybe sometimes it is, but I feel that thinking ain't necessary (and even welcome) in L4D2.\nSomeone may say that I'm another L4D1 addict being mad at Valve because of L4D2 and porting older campaigns, but no, I can't be like that since I actually bought L4D1 after buying L4D2 (yes, I was that dumb) and while I feel L4D1 was worth my money, I think I wasted $$$ on L4D2. But I am mad at Valve as I think L4D2 is step back. And the saddest thing is that people moved anyway to then new and fresh game which is now practically as old as L4D1 which I prefer.","January 14, 2014","false","164.4"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","22","37","2","1"

Definitely good feature here.\n\n- The enemies not really that frightening because first, the way they behave are funny, second, you got 3 more friends (or AI) have your back. Be careful though, don't let them swarm your team.\n\n- Not only normal zombies, but also unique special zombies with different abilities, and also uncommon normal zombies that have unique traits on them.\n\n- Different game mode to play. There's versus mode who can make you the special zombies, and have purpose to prevent the survivor from saving themselves. There's also more game mode like scavenger, survival, realism. You can even add more with mods.\n\n- A lot of choices of weapons. Additional melee weapons that makes this game better than its predecessor.\n\n8.7/10","July 1, 2014","true","101.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game will appeal to others who are looking for competitive, fun, and intense gameplay. Feel the wrath of hundred and hundred of zombies launching themselves at your throats.\n\nDon't stop for one sec for a Smoker to bind you with it's tongue. Don't stay in a open spot for a Hunter to claw you to death. Don't seperate from your teammates, you'll find yourself at the mercy of an Jockey. Zombies aren't your only enemies, watch your feet for acid that burns like no others from the mouth of an Spitter. Zombies are not noticing you? Then bathe in the bile of a Boomer to show a horde of zombies how good you looked......to eat. Narrow areas are the Charger's favorite spot to squash you into pancakes. She may be crying, but once the Witch is startled, you're in for a world of hurt, hope you have health insurance. Rarely appears, the Tank is the boss of zombies. He's one badass that will put your lights out.","December 7, 2010","true","448.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I was lucky enough to find a group of guys and gals who play games for the fun and friendship and don't really care if you aren't a perfect player. The public matches are not so nice but stick with them. I have found that if you just make sure you are a team player and watch each others back or attack together that you will most likely survive a public match.

Multiple zombie hoards come attacking you wave after wave and can stop suddenly. Which sets this game apart from other zombie games is there is certain zombie types in this game. One guy as a tongue that stretches out and grabs people, another guy is a big fat blob who goes around puking on people and attracting zombies to them (and when he dies he blows up)! The game is set up as FPS with the player having the ability to heal themselves (while being not able to shoot) or heal their partner. The best game setting for me personally was the ability to play humans vs zombies where you take charge of one of the special zombie types.\n\nThis game was close to getting a rating around 7.7 (as the premise for me can get boring after sometime), but it being the original hard hitting zombie title I will give it an 8.\n\n8/10","August 29, 2014","true","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/550/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This is one of those classic must own games on steam.\n\nThe game premise revolves around being able to choose between four characters - and a certain gun set such as machine guns and shotguns. Multiple zombie hoards come attacking you wave after wave and can stop suddenly. Which sets this game apart from other zombie games is there is certain zombie types in this game. One guy as a tongue that stretches out and grabs people, another guy is a big fat blob who goes around puking on people and attracting zombies to them (and when he dies he blows up)! The game is set up as FPS with the player having the ability to heal themselves (while being not able to shoot) or heal their partner. The best game setting for me personally was the ability to play humans vs zombies where you take charge of one of the special zombie types.\n\nThis game was close to getting a rating around 7.7 (as the premise for me can get boring after sometime), but it being the original hard hitting zombie title I will give it an 8.\n\n8/10","August 29, 2014","true","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is a good single player effort but the multiplayer is almost perfect. The worst thing about this game is the community. But don't let that discourage you. I was lucky enough to find a group of guys and gals who play games for the fun and friendship and don't really care if you aren't a perfect player. The public matches are not so nice but stick with them. I have found that if you just make sure you are a team player and watch each others back or attack together that you will most likely survive a public match.

Everyone seems to have their favorite when playing  these campaigns.\nSome love and some hate these certain characters.\n\nOn the other hand, playing online is a completely different story. Some games go smoothly with little to no issues, while other times a single player can take down their own team or slow them down.\n\nA con would have to be lagging depending on the internet/server.\n\nAnother con is that third party servers are irritating when going after achievements. If you're going for achievements, stay way from third party servers they make it harder depending on the group.\n\nIt is always important to keep in mind what your skill level as well as everyone else. Join a game/create a game that is best suited for you, joining a game that is out of your league or too easy may hinder your group.\n\nOverall, the game is essentially about teamwork and how others bring out each other's strengths as well as weaknesses.\nIt's a gamble everytime creating a lobby or joining someone's team to see if everyone will carry through to the end.\n\nI highly recommend it, and I hope that this game is just as much fun for others as it has been for me.\nI apologize for any grammar errors, and thank you for taking the time to read it.","December 18, 2014","true","144.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Modding the game, downloading new maps, skins, or different game modes is very easy due to Steam Community Workshop. If some aspect of the game becomes dull and unintriguing, you can always find new content on the Steam Workshop.\n\nIt's fun at first, but over time it starts lacking the same experience as in the beginning if you keep paying the same game modes.  The community isn't the greatest either when it comes to newer players. You automatically receive a nasty comment when you make a mistake. Game would be more fun if other players weren't as discouraging. But, not all players are bad and rude, there are some players that help you out and teach you other things that you might've not already known.\n\nI'm putting this review as recommended but my thoughts about this game are mixed and I'd recommend on some aspects but not on other ones. The biggest downside to this game, I think, is the childish Community, but if you're up for it and don't really care about that, it would be a fun game. On the otherhand, if you dislike childish Communities, don't buy this game unless you're going to play with close friends that don't mind you sucking at first or completely carrying the team depending how good you are.","March 24, 2014","true","92.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Everything from sharing resources to pulling them up off of a ledge. Leaving a teammate behind decreases your chances of survival and running off on your own almost always ends tragically. Hence, you will come to realise that it is fun sticking together and helping one another.\n\n**As a special infected (e.g. Smoker, Boomer, Charger, Jockey, Tank, etc...) [Only in versus mode] **\n\nSimilar plays are executed from a different perspective. Only when the team that plans and works together as a whole will prevent the survivors from progressing the stage and winning. Attacking alone rarely has much of an effect since you'll get focused as soon as you are spotted, but there are a few opportunities  that allows zombie heroics (like the coveted death charge).\n\nThis game offers many competitive modes with different difficulty levels of your choice. It also brings teamplay to a whole new level as you challenge higher difficulty as you progress.\n\nWorth a shot if you like zombie games!

( in retrospect that is actually a compliment)..The lack of understanding is just unbearable.. Irony is easily mistaken for ignorance.... Sarcasm is not understood and the amount of people that don't have a sense of humour.... It's a crime against humanity. I'm not that intolerant but when it comes to certain people i am very intolerant and some people may say well you shouldn't be intolerant but that in itself is intolerance. i would recomend this with friends in which case i would say go and buy an xbox but the second you go online it is an unwarrented hail of ignorant comments about how noobish you are.. but when you retort with something witty and poke fun at how seriously they take the game you suddenly get called a pubecent child and i quote a '7 yr old' and when you then tell them that you in-fact aren't seven and ironicaly call them a 'kid' another hail of ignorant ♥♥♥♥  is thrown at you and when you try to explain irony to them they question the meaning of irony at which point you explain it and give the example you just gave back to them and they kick you from the server................. i would rate this game as worth a buy in the sale but at all costs avoid the online community for fear of actually turning into an undead brainless husk.... thanks for your time love kisses and s*** ect  if you have anymore questions ask me on steam but in all seriousness aviod the community","August 9, 2014","true","5.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The replayability is really high due to the high variety of elements and game mechanics, the most important "you run through a campaign" so you don't just camp and survive, it forces you to rush to advance in the game, teamwork ,random horde spawning and special infected, tank, changing environment, important checkpoints,smart level design that forces you to certain situations like rushing, where "adrenaline kicks out". The zombie AI is so annoying that is brilliant, they charge you by sideways, or behind and they always attack the vulnerable one, isolated from the group, special infected will work together in making your "life" miserable. 10/10","March 16, 2014","true","383.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The introductions from the first game, such as new Special Infected, new weapons and campaigns makes this game a must buy to any gamer. The campaign has the standard maps, which in turn are great, but best played with friends, as the AI are dull in the sense to play with, as they will basically do most of the shooting for you. The Multiplayer aspect to the game, such as Versus will always have people playing and there are plently of servers to play with. A warning though, Versus does get extremly competitive at times and you will want to die inside if you are losing.\n\nPros:\n- Improved from the original Left 4 Dead\n- Extremly balanced gameplay\n- Great level design\n- Guns and Special Infected improved\n- Fun for everyone. Single player is fun, Campaign with friends is fun and Multiplayer is fun.\n\nCons:\n- If you don't have friends then the game can be boring.\n- AI on singleplayer will do everything for you. (Can be seen as a good thing, but not entirely)\n- Hard Rain will make you want to cry and die inside. (Like the witches)\n- Left 4 Dead was known for being dark and more tense with gameplay, which is completly lacking in Left 4 Dead 2. Only in a few areas is there darkness, but instead you walk down streets completly bright. Only in a minority of maps, such as the swamp maps and when it rains is there any kind of fear.\n\nOverall, the game is a must buy for everyone. Now that is has been a few years, I do suggest only getting it when it is on sale. Playing the game just for the campaign will get you a few hours played, but if you do get into the versus and the competitive game modes, you will be guarenteed a ton of hours played.","July 24, 2014","true","439.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well, they go together very well. Not sure what really else you want to know.\n\nThe game mechanics work great, the game has workshop support; it is also well taken care of by Valve and the community.\n\nIf you have a chance, listen to the developer commentary. It will give you a real look inside the games Valve makes.\n\nMost people who have things bad to say about the game say things like:\nThis stuff should have been in Left 4 Dead 1.\nThere's limited maps.\nWhy isn't there this ridiculous zombie type X, Y, Z\nAnswering those problems… Yes, I'm aware of the controversy around the splitting of games. I know I wouldn't have liked it, but I bought the complete pack after this happened, and long before TF2 became free2play. For me, the split seems to make logical sense. Left 4 Dead 1 was a harder game partly due to the fact of the limited weapons. Left 4 Dead 2 opened the doors on this and added a variety of things. While you can play Left 4 Dead 1 maps in the 2nd game, I still feel the need to play it on the original game, with the original mechanics.\n\nLimited maps.. Well it does follow a story, and the maps use a AI director in the background to make changes to maps. In the core, there are about 3 or 4 (if I remember correctly) base maps for each part of a campaign that get used. The director makes changes to spawns and what not on the fly. You probably won't be playing thousands of hours on this title, but expect a good return for your money.\n\nZombie types… This is a big thing with some people. The root of this issue is that there aren’t any binding specs to "zombies". Does the mutation/virus/disease effect people, humans, animals? If so, what can happen to each?\n\nValve tries to make the game reasonable, and the mechanics show that. They are well balanced, and don’t require hundreds of hours to perfect.","March 29, 2015","true","207.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The introductions from the first game, such as new Special Infected, new weapons and campaigns makes this game a must buy to any gamer. The campaign has the standard maps, which in turn are great, but best played with friends, as the AI are dull in the sense to play with, as they will basically do most of the shooting for you. The Multiplayer aspect to the game, such as Versus will always have people playing and there are plently of servers to play with. A warning though, Versus does get extremly competitive at times and you will want to die inside if you are losing.\n\nPros:\n- Improved from the original Left 4 Dead\n- Extremly balanced gameplay\n- Great level design\n- Guns and Special Infected improved\n- Fun for everyone. Single player is fun, Campaign with friends is fun and Multiplayer is fun.\n\nCons:\n- If you don't have friends then the game can be boring.\n- AI on singleplayer will do everything for you. (Can be seen as a good thing, but not entirely)\n- Hard Rain will make you want to cry and die inside. (Like the witches)\n- Left 4 Dead was known for being dark and more tense with gameplay, which is completly lacking in Left 4 Dead 2. Only in a few areas is there darkness, but instead you walk down streets completly bright. Only in a minority of maps, such as the swamp maps and when it rains is there any kind of fear.\n\nOverall, the game is a must buy for everyone. Now that is has been a few years, I do suggest only getting it when it is on sale. Playing the game just for the campaign will get you a few hours played, but if you do get into the versus and the competitive game modes, you will be guarenteed a ton of hours played.","July 24, 2014","true","439.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Because of L4D, I often did not play Campaign and immediately went into Versus Mode. I learned very quickly how to communicate with my team, and look for key things such as where items might spawn and what would be most useful to the team.\n\nIn this game you really have to rely on things like having some form of communication (most preferrably a microphone), and you have to keep a sharp eye out for special spawns and when your teammates are likely to get hit, or are hit.\n\nYou also have to know that this is a very competitive multiplayer game. If you don't cooperate, more than likely you're going to get kicked; it isn't a fun feeling. Another thing to add, is that you will definitely become enraged with this game and its ridiculous moments. You'll probably foam at the mouth for a while, and then you'll say how much you want to quit. But then, you'll want to come back to it for whatever god-forsaken reason. You come back for the hilarious moments, the moments where you actually push through and you win a game. That's the reason I keep going back. I don't let my losses permanently affect my views on the game. A lot of it is luck of the draw, so why bother being mad at it?\n\nI don't really know how helpful this is in terms of the game's content, but everyone by now should know what it is. It's a zombie-based FPS that's a whole rollercoaster of fun. Try it, if you haven't already.","March 13","true","388.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Why buy left for dead 2? I am 30+ year old gamer, one of the old schoolers who grew up with just about every console and pc game around.\n\nI promise this game will satisfy both your shooting FPS needs as well as the Co-Op thing, This is the real deal. No Rambo BS here (RAMBO = one man show can kill all the zombies by him/her self), you won't survive a minute on your own (the game is made that way).\n\nLuckily through this game I have been able to find really good Co-Op friends and that is probably the main reason that I play this game so often.\n\nIt's like a little like multiplayer chess game, everytime you play, there are different challenges ahead, allthough its exactly the same level, the same horde and so on, the players ability to Co-Op decides the outcome (Yeah!!!!)\n\nSo get this game if you like real Co-Op and FPS combined.\n\nOne tip though, to truly enjoy the games co-op feautures you have to go at it at the hardest level (Expert) and play on realism (no help in game)). On the easier settings/levels the Rambo mode is still at works, meaning you can pretty much go at it alone and survive quite easily, which is quite boring if you play a Co-op FPS game.\n\nSo conclusion: BUY BUY BUY, PLAY PLAY PLAY, HAVE FUN FUN FUN!!! :D","May 18","true","223.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

I think I can make a little review on it.\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is the sequel to Left 4 Dead, no ♥♥♥♥.\nIt's co-op, there the more actual players than AI, the better.\nThe modding community is still up, well and at it after all these years.\nEven though there are new survivors in the sequel, you can still play the classic maps, which is perfect, if you only have Left 4 Dead 2, and don't want to spend money on the first one.\nThe cons are that the players in PvP are really toxic. People yelling at you for not pouncing someone from the other side of the map, etc.\nAs much as I love this game, playing with bots could be fun if there were not always behind you, not moving forward if you got lost.\nAll in all, I have loved this game since I heard of it, and since I started playing it myself. If you like slaughtering some zombies with 3 of your friends, and fighting very stronger Tanks every now and then.

You and three friends must shoot, tear and slash through an unrelenting mass of raging zombies. From the moment you leave the safe house to the final rescue chopper, you are completely dependent on each other and constantly hunted by special boss zombies that behave with their own aggressive, strategizing intelligence. Thanks to Valve’s omniscient “AI Director,” the zombies spawn differently every time, the special infected try alternative attacks, and even weapon drops are changed based on your performance. This makes every single playthrough slightly different, and the resultant strategy to survive much more organic and integral than any other FPS on the market. Just like Street Fighter is much more than mashing on buttons, Left 4 Dead is far more than mindless shooting. Played properly, L4D offers 100+ hours of unrivaled co-op insanity.","November 15, 2014","true","44.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Because of that, this will just be a short, personal and slightly biased review. I find the community to be the best out of any multiplayer game I've played - through playing on valve servers, to finding communities on modded servers. It's the people you play with that keep this game alive for me. Find yourself a good community and you will have a fun place to play for years of your life. Find yourself a good team of players and you can enjoy vanilla versus/campaign just as much. Overall, great game, different modes for whichever suits you, and so much fun to be had when you play with the right people.","July 29, 2013","true","549.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Not only does the game itself suck, the community is also quite awful. Go spend your money on some indie games or something.\n\nLong Review: Left 4 Dead 2. Although the critics and players rave about this game being one of the best zombie games on the market, it really isn't. Sure, there's lots of different areas to fight through, but they are all just retextured copies of the others. Get weapons, kill zombies, press E, kill zombies, get different weapons, kill zombies, kill more zombies, press E. That is how most of the levels work. There are also the levels where you collect x, bring to y, and hold E. Get weapons, kill zombies, pick up object, run past zombies, hold E. Rinse and repeat until you've beaten the level. Now that we've discussed the single player problems, let's move on to the multiplayer. The community sucks and expects you to know what each weapon is, what it does, and how to use it effectively as well as knowing each level like the back of your hand. You will be kicked if you don't have either 100 hours of play time or are quite skilled in everything I just listed. The game modes where you can play as the infected aren't fun either. The infected are difficult to use and are at a disadvantage when compared to the survivors. The only good thing about this game is the great integration of the Steam Workshop. You can download different music, new weapons textures, new levels, and more. In other words, buy this game if you want to be disappointed.

I really recommend this game to any age, that is if you aren't afraid of zombies ;). Though seriously, Left 4 Dead 2 is about the easiest game to run, in my opinion. Its worth the $20, but if you get it on sale like I did, It's even more worth it! I love the multiplayer most! I mostly play Versus, but I play Campaign every now and then. I have a couple of friends and we usually do Left 4 Dead 2 Nights every Friday night.

Im just gonna go out loud and say it if by the time youre reading this review and havent played or own L4D2 you need to get this game right now. Left 4 dead 2 is a simple game where four Charecters Coach, Ellis, Nick and Rochelle are trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. The game is tons of fun and will almost never get boring and plus as a bonus to already 5 great campaings it also adds all the campaings from the first L4D and remasters them and plus all the dlc campaings for aboslutly free. Now like with every game it has small issues that ruin the game. The shooting mechanics arent always the best and the hit detection works when it wants to. The melee weapons are a fun way of disposing of Zombies but when it comes to melee weapons its best to choose a sharp weapon instead of a blunt one. Overall the game is awesome and you just need to own this tile with some small issues its a great time and even better with friends i give Left 4 Dead 2  9.5/10","February 1, 2014","true","33.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It's turned into an action/adventure instead of a horror like game. Thought I'm not complaining because it's L4D, and I like them both c: 7/10\n\nOverall score: 7/10\n\nCharacters:\n\nNick- The somewhat of a second-in-command in the group, a deadpan, snarky gambler who probably isn't from the South, but out of bad luck, less or more, has ended up there because of the zombie apocalypse. He is rather attractive for a game character but I rarely, if ever play him by choice. I rate him 6/10.\n\nCoach- Coach is the most supportive member of the L4D2 crew. He seems to enjoy football, Gibby Jr. and Midnight Riders. He seems to get along with Ellis and Rochelle. He is pretty cool, don't really pay much attention to him though. I rate him 5/10.\n\nEllis- Ellis is a "adorkable" hillbilly who has the same interests as Coach, and is a mechanic. He also plays bass guitar!\nEllis has a bunch of stories about his time with his buddy Keith, usually starting with, "This one time". I rate him 10/10. He is my favorite character.\n\nRochelle- Probably the most hated character in gaming history, or Valve games for that matter. But I think she is rather boring, but the second to most supportive character in L4D2. She is also a reporter and a fan of electronic band Depeche Mode. I rate her 4/10.\n\nOverall score: 7/10\n\nSpecial Infected: (These will not get ratings)\n\nThe Jockey: This small infected jumps on your head and claws at your face. People think it's humping you, IT REALLY ISN'T.\nHe has an annoying maniacal laugh and I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS THING.\n\nThe Charger: This large infected runs into you and tries to separate you from the other survivors to smash the hell out og you. His right arm is his main weapon, he grabs survivors and hits them with it too. His left arm doesn't do anything but flap with every movement. People say it's cause he masturbates a lot. (Which is actually not funny k.) I believe that his left arm was not operating correctly, he had a muscle not working in it causing the infection to spread on the right side, or all the nutrients he had were separated to the right side. There is many theories but let's just say CAUSE HE DOES.\n\nThe Spitter: This medium but somewhat tall infected spits corrosive acid at the survivors in attempt to damage them, not kill. She has a sagging stomach, sagging breasts and a pink thong. Ew. Her reason for her method of attack seems rather more scientific, but I wouldn't know how to describe it in the best words. x.x Sorry.\n\nCampaigns: There are a bit more campaigns in L4D2 compared to L4D.\n\nDead Center\nThe Parish\nSwamp Fever\nHard Rain\nDark Carnival, and\nThe Passing\n\nMy personal favorite campaigns are The Parish and Hard Rain.\n\nOverall:\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is a great game for people who like teamwork, action, survival, strategy and simply zombie killing.\n\nHave fun! :)\n","January 3, 2015","true","253.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

Some people say that this game is linear (what games don't have linearity?). While it is true, the extensive modding community add so many unique characters, maps, weapons, and tactical situations that the linearity completely disappears, leaving behind a hectic battle for survival.\n\nYou have multiple modes of gameplay. You can either fend for yourself in single player with bot helpers, go through a map with friends in campaign, or fight as infected in Versus and Scavenge. The difficulty modes add a lot of variety, as well. Expert requires the FPS skills of a Call Of Duty or Counter-Strike veteran and the teamwork of life-long friends.\n\nIt's never tiring to go through any map, because there's so many ways to go through it and so many different situations. The events that happen because of it creates a lot of laughs and a lot of inspiring frustration.\n\nIt can only get better from here as Valve releases sequels.","December 29, 2013","true","051.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Say what you will about the way Valve treated the L4D community by delivering a sequel so quickly, but there's no denying that L4D2 is a better, more polished game than the first.\n\nThis version adds new weapons, new healing options, and new special infected zombies that weren't present in the first. It doesn't really change gameplay much, but it does add a bit of variety that the original lacked. The maps are solid, and the weather effects are great, particularly in the Hard Rain level. The melee weapons that the first game painfully lacked are finally present here.\n\nThere is an active map-building community, and Valve continues to offer official maps and gameplay support. This gives the game a fair amount of replay value. But most of the replay value comes from the Versus mode. A game of L4D2 Versus is a great experience that never gets tired.","July 23, 2011","true","266.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boi_maskarado/recommended/550/","boi_maskarado","Rodrigosth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boi_maskarado/","63 products in account","I was introduced into the L4D universe in the first one, I never really got to play it but some time later L4D2 came out and I bought after remembering the fun my friends had playing the first one. All from each other’s houses and that seemed fun.\n\nSo first thing about the game I’d like to talk about is the survivors. I understand leaving the first cast behind must have been somewhat though in the begging, however they first cast made it back in the awesome free DLC that completely defeated the purpose of having bought the first game.\nPersonality wise, the new guys were kind of a letdown, Coach and Nick were alright for me, they could bring seriousness and humor into the game at the same time, Rochelle however was just as bland as a concrete slab and Ellis was just there to be the group clown with the ever-comical southern accent. I think they were alright and somehow ran away from the typical zombie survivor template but the first group felt like the formula and they should have left it that way.\nNext step brings us to the special infected. Having more of them instead of replacements was just right, the combos they could make both as bots or in competitive were nice, such as having a Spitter burning you up whenever you got pinned by one of the other infected, Jockeys dragging you away from the group when you are barely in the safe room, Chargers making the whole group fly into walls... It was nice to have to be more mindful about other threats. I’d also like to mention the “uncommon” infected from each chapter, they were like the chocolate chips on a normal horde cookie; they stood out, had a different function but were not as imposing as a special infected.\nTo keep this review from being too long I’ll stand by the items and weapons. Most notably we have the new melee weapons. Many people leave those behind because they can shove with the normal weapons and gameplay wise some people considered them useless or unbalanced. I simply loved them, some were funny or simply badass but nothing beats mowing down a horde when close to death under adrenaline with a guitar while the rest of the group is back you up with guns from behind. Parts fly off, heads get smashed in and you get covered in the blood of your enemies. Melee is satisfying when used right... or with a chainsaw.\nThe new guns were also cool, the magnum simply made a neat line of infected explode with a shot, the SCAR-H’s permanent burst fire was also something nice to have when you wanted more accurate shots without having to worry about the trigger, then that huge machine gun that came in the DLC was simply delicious to use, very limited ammo and no reloads, you just wait for a horde to unload it and scream the inner Rambo in you and lastly the grenade launcher that you should simply leave if you are not good with it or you are willing to sacrifice everyone’s health for some copious amounts of intestines flying off.\nSome more important new features were the defib packs that came to steal the importance of first-aid kits, the adrenaline shots that were perfect for that tight moment, the boomer bile to throw in a fire or at a tank, so much fun and lastly the weapon mods like laser sights and incendiary/explosive ammo, more tools to cause mayhem and survive in style.\nOverall, it’s a nice game to sink an afternoon in with friends, if you don’t have friends to play you can join random games but it’s not as fun. A mic is highly recommended to have higher survival chances. In case you get bored from running from zombies, there are game modes that allow to play as one or to hold your ground against waves of infected meat. There’s also the dreaded realism mode that removes all visual and audio hints and forces you group to be tight and communicate everything and on last word I’d like to talk about the maps, it’s the southern ‘merica experience and a refreshing area to play in, all the way to New Orleans.\nTL;DR: I am Rodrigosth and I recommend this game to you and your friends to play together.\nSpecial thanks to Hirow to help me keep my facts straight.\n","May 14, 2014","true","101.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story is quite good for a sequel that does not follow directly from its predecessor. The levels are well made for a zombie game, unlike many that we have all played before.  The simple tasks within the levels are mainly hold the fort type and scavenging parts never get old and are always fun and rewarding. Me and my friends can never leave this game with its outstanding replay-ability. The game has some nice multiplayer game modes like “Versus”.  Where you play through the Co-Op levels as you would normally except all the special zombies are human controlled (it gets very fun with friends). This game has Steam Workshop support if in the rare case you get bored of the default ones. Did I also say this game comes with redone levels from the first "Left 4 Dead"? Did I also say you should buy this game? Did I also say that it's made by Valve?","May 11, 2013","true","174.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beet_Bowl/recommended/550/","Beet_Bowl","overwatch is the new black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beet_Bowl/","94 products in account","Left 4 Dead 2 is like one of those arcade games where you shoot zombies. You can select your campaign, or "map", and each one lasts from 30 to 90 minutes. Guns and other items randomly spawn around the map. There are also "ammo piles", which are basically infinite sources of ammo for your guns that you can find. There are also medpacks and other HP items that you can use. Furthermore, upgrades for your guns, like temporary fire ammo or laser sights, spawn in certain areas. Now do you get what I mean by "arcade-like"?\n\nPersonally, I loved this game when I got into it. I played the first four campaigns on my first day playing this, and adored them all. My favorite part of this game is how the levels look and are layed out. I don't want to spoil anything, but some of them are pretty creative.\n\nEvery couple of minutes you'll probably encounter a "Special Infected", or a zombie that has an ability that can screw you over in two seconds. Some can pounce on you and start ripping you to shreds, while others cover you in vomit that blinds you and makes you a zombie magnet for a while. However, there is one Special Infected that has a unique ability from the others, which I won't spoil.\n\nHowever, as much as I loved this game when I first played it, there are some downsides. After a few campaigns shooting zombies gets repetitive. Most of this game is just "shoot the zombie" and "shoot the other zombie" as you make your way through maps. Although Special Infected make it a bit more interesting, I would like to see more variety in enemies if they make a third game. However, seeing and exploring the maps is still fun, along with playing with friends and sometimes online (The community isn't exactly the best I've seen).\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes exploring, or arcade-like zombie shooters. Although it does get repetitive fast, there are things that encourage you to play like co-op and other game modes. Plus there's Steaam Workshop for this game, so you can download user-created campaigns or change your flashlight to an image of Shrek.","May 26, 2014","true","30.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I very much enjoy when about 3 zombies run up around you and you can't move an inch and even when you spray about 18 shotgun shells into their face it seems to do nothing because Valve is such a great game company and has amazing coders. I also love the times when I am running from a Tank and then one little zombie hits me and causes me to go from running to a complete stop in about 2 miliseconds, but that's okay, I enjoy getting fisted by the tank. Another thing I enjoy is when it takes about 15 minutes to heal yourself with one med-pack. I think this adds alot of time so you can think about what a fun game you are playing. Even better than that is when your teammates or bots heal you with a med-pack. Nothing screams "I love you" more than when you heal someone with a med-pack that takes 10 minutes to use at the end of the finale. By far my favorite thing is the wide variety of characters to choose from. You get to choose between a redneck, a gambler, a fat black man and a ghetto/sassy black girl.

Turn it into Shrek!\nSmoker annoying or creepy? Turn it into the Dusk from Kingdom Hearts and give it the Yoshi soundfont.\nHunter's pounce annoy you? Give it the Sonic soundfont, at least makes it somewhat funny.\nBoomers? Turn them into Dr. Robotnik (yes, there is a mod like that, look it up)\n\nDon't like the music? Find new music from the workshop you like.\n\nThis game + Workshop = Hilarity and much more funner game playing. :D","December 27, 2014","true","23.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Almost nothing different. I was very dis- appoint in this game, at first! All the different gamemodes made up for a lot. The game has a lot of gore (like the first one, again) but is still very fun to play with ever gamemode. Two problems I have with this game is that I go to play campain, but it doesn't leave off where i was, it starts me with random people on a completly different mission, I don't know if this is just me.

It just never gets old! The gameplay is really awesome, and shooting the hell out of zombies with your friends is always a good time!\n\nThis brings me to my next point. This game is a hundred times better when played with friends. I played this almost every night for a year or two on the Xbox 360 and met 2 of my really good friends on there. It's even more fun to play on Steam because you can use mods to make the game cooler and funnier, and even add new campaigns.\n\nI strongly suggest getting this game.","December 31, 2013","true","62.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
