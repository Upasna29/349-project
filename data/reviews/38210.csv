Stripping away the fluffy exterior reveals a meaty core that will satisfy even the healthiest of gaming appetite for the time it will take to finish.So while Roogoo might look like a standard falling-block puzzler when you first lay your eyes on it, after taking it out for a spin for about an hour or so, its fun factor becomes apparent. It does a good job of keeping the gameplay fresh and increasingly challenging throughout the stages.An engaging, if sometimes brain fizzing, game.","April 22, 2014","true","3.4"," 60 of 75 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","60","75","2","0"

It was almost like it put me in a psychedelic trance unlike anything I’ve ever seen or done before .\nIt took me a moment to realize this but I was in the world of roogoo, or so I thought, this world was colorful and fun but little did I know the true evil of this situation. Every single meemoo I ever crushed in my wake lie in the pit gasping for air as the butterflies pick up prisims and burry the meemoos in their cries of agony I heard I small voice in the heaping pile of meemoo bodys and heart shape prisms. This small voice slowly fainted away muffled by the hum of the butterflies.\nI abruptly woke up to a pounding head and shaking body I was in fear and sorrow but I didn’t quite understand what happened. As I thought about what had happened more and more some pieces started to come together but it wasn’t all that I thought. once again I played roogoo.\nThe second time playing immediately went into state deep relaxation slipping into the world of roogoo for the final time. Opening my eyes I ignored the bright colors and music and demanded to talk to the butterfly king about what was happening to the meemoos, the butterfly scouts led me to his castle and into the throne room.\nHe told me with a deep voice, “Why have you come and for what purpose do have seeing me?” asked the king. “I come here to talk about the murdering and disposal of meemoo and their children, and what they have done to deserve this”, I shouted. The king hesitated and told me what the meemoos have done.” A long time ago when I was only a boy the meemoo used to terrorize the butterflies, they would pillage the settlements, kill the men and ♥♥♥♥ the women. The day of reckoning came when the butterflies formed a government and army to stop the meemoos from this treachery. My father was a glorious leader marching onto battle for the sole purpose of protecting the people he loves.” The king looks proud of his people and continues on, “finally the battle had been won, at a cost greater than no other my father had died and many kinsmen lie on the battle, but it was a price that had to be paid. The meemoos dwindiled in numbers for years after the war, but as always they will come back in numbers greater than before” the king acting as if they were pests.\nThe king continues with his story “many decades past and the meemoos started to build up their population and now its as big as the butterflies, the only difference is that butterflies are much weaker in the body but smarter in the mind.” The king started talking again, “recently the meemoos have been revolting and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ again so now we must kill them for good this time.\nI was disgusted by this statement,  meemoos deserve to live just like the butterflys but on the other hand they ♥♥♥♥ and steal and are bad but so are the butterflies are just as bad for killing them. Only one thing can be done…\nThere was a central air duct in the center of roogoo land and it filterd clean air from the real world, without it everyone would die and suffocate but that was the only way for peace. I ran to the duct and smashed the control panel so that it closed and everything died. As it closed I saw the faces of all creatures and I felt remorse. Suddenly I woke too find it was all a dream but when I started roogoo every one was dead and it was an empty field so it was actually real.\n","August 21, 2014","true","1.4"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","27","38","11","2"

Some epic, some intimate, some barely believable--YouTube is filled with clips of people far better at Roogoo than you, doing amazing things (to people like you). Roogoo wants you--yes, you--to experience even more thrilling, more epic moments than ever before with a beefed up single-player story and the addition of map-changing levolution events and show-stopping destruction online. That’s the aim… and in this respect, the game is a roaring success.\n\nroogoo is a significant step forward from number 3, both on and offline. The change is more marked in single-player, where the story strikes a more intimate note, echoing the buddy-banter from the roogoo games. Your squad mates moo and poohave more developed personalities, and there are some memorable little moments in between all the shooting and shouting. At one point, Poo starts subtly dancing to some lift music in a rare pocket of silence sandwiched between some intense gunplay. “What?” he asks baffled-looking squad-mates, “I love this song. It’s a great freaking song.”","June 29, 2014","true","17.2"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","23","35","0","2"

I graduated from Harvard with a Master's Degree in Business with a minor in Economics in 1984, I  started working for small banks and eventually worked my way up to the Head of Strategic Development at Goldmann Sachs by 1998. By 2007 I was making over 500 million a year. I had a wife, who I used to love dearly, who I'd been with for close to 30 years. We had 2 children, a son named Michael and a daughter named Angela. By all accounts, my life was great. I was moving up in the world, and I had everything I'd ever wanted. Or so I thought. Then I found Roogoo.\n\nIt started one snowy day in early November of 2013. I was browsing through the newest games on Steam, and I saw one named Roogoo. I was intrigued, but I had no idea what I was in for. I bought that game, downloaded it, and started playing, but I had no idea what I was in for. When I first started playing, I couldnt sleep for a week. All I could think about, all I could do, was Roogoo. The first night, when I tried to go to the dinner table to eat with my wife, I couldnt get up from my chair. Roogoo called to me. She had to bring me dinner at my computer. That was the start of the end. Since then, across my 11 steam accounts, I've logged over 6,000 hours. When I sleep, which is rare, I dream of Roogoo. When I eat, its at my computer, while I play Roogoo. I quit my job. My wife left me. I haven't seen my kids in almost 4 months. Do I care? No. I'm happier than I've ever been. And it's thanks to this game.\n\nEvery man and woman on Earth needs to play Roogoo. All future achievements of mankind would become worthless, all humans would cease to care about the world around them. Roogoo is the pinnacle of human achievement. I feel honored to be one of the first to find Enlightenment. But it's not enough. The rest of you must buy this game. The only reason I took time away from playing Roogoo is to spread the word. You. Must. Buy. Roogoo. Believe me, it will change your life. It will change human history. Now, back to Roogoo.","June 29, 2014","true","44.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","11","15","9","0"

This makes failing a level (over and over) less irritating.\n\nMultiplayer is fine aswell. You can either choose to just play along and see who finishes first or totally screw each other over.

I watched many different YouTube playthroughs for this game, and also read many reviews - a good number of both have (unfortunately) involved the authors giving up on the game within the first few minutes. For anyone who ends up trying this game, please, I implore you all to give it a chance and play through at least the first few levels/sections before determining a verdict.\n\nIf you like challenging, brutal twitch/reflex-based gameplay, and have masochistic tendencies, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are decent - the backgrounds are nice, however, you will mostly be paying attention to the falling block shapes. The music and sounds are okay, but I preferred to play with the audio muted in favor of my own. The story is pretty basic, but provides a good rationale of why you are playing with different block shapes (which are actually "meteors" in the game world).\n\nThe controls are very simple - left and right arrow keys to rotate the base of each platform, and down arrow key to accelerate the fall of your current block(s). The tutorials are quick and helpful. The learning curve is entirely dependent on your skill at twitch/reflex gameplay. The most difficult part for me was the last section (6), which has a combination of every mechanic in the game. Difficulty progression is reasonable, and each new mechanic introduced is given in a basic form before the advanced conception in subsequent levels.\n\nDuring gameplay, different block shapes will fall through an initial platform, and your goal is to get enough stacks of each shape to the bottommost platform. As you progress, new mechanics are introduced, like more shapes to deal with, opening/closing lids that must be bypassed, and blocks that fall in rapid succession. Timing is the primary element in this game, and quick reflexes will benefit you greatly.\n\nOverall, the game is a fantastic challenge for twitch junkies, and I often find myself raging at how much the game seems to troll you at the right (or wrong) times.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","October 15, 2014","true","4.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I admit that the high rating does surprise me, it's a nice little game but clearly not "close to 80%"- talk about Metacritic :D\n\nIt's a puzzle game. Coloured shapes drop from the sky into a tower of rotating disks; your job is to spin them so that the shapes slide into the matching holes all the way to the bottom. Drop em all down and you win. Miss too many and you lose the level. Things take up some speed after a while and it can be pretty hard to match the perfect ratio, but it's mostly a chill-out game. It's clearly not about thinking ahead and planning moves, the challenge is speed and reaction time.\n\nThe whole thing is wrapped into an utterly cute little story with child-friendly silly monkey creatures, complimented by catchy tunes and silly voices. Makes it all look like a children's game- but actually it might be a bit too hard for those.\n\nSo... yeah well, it's fun. In small doses. I can't see me playing Roogoo for hours on end and I actually enjoy stacking/matching games. For the price it's fair enough to say you should go and see for yourself. I... got it during a sale for 40cents. Can't say I didn't get my money's worth :D","April 26, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

All puzzle games are repetitive but due to the randomness of when blocks drop, it seemed that skill was not a deciding factor in this game for being able to beat stages.\n\nRating:  2/10  Value:  $0.25","June 2, 2013","true","0.2"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

From the beginning you are sucked in by the immersive atmosphere and enchanting soundtrack. The storyline in this game is 10/10. The characters in this game are some of the most remarkable characters ever created. The ending is absolutely heartbreaking, but is still one of the best. In conclusion, this game is one of the best puzzlers and has one of the best stories; if you thought Portal was a challenging game then you're in for a big surprise mother ♥♥♥♥ers.","December 3, 2013","true","0.4"," 8 of 33 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","8","33","0","1"

He saw Matthew and Victoria sitting across from each other, confused, he did not intervene. He stared intently in disgust, yet glued to the spot, in order to see clearly what was happening. Victoria rubbed Matthew's nipples ferociously. Matthew by this point was turned on to holy hell, and was ready to rip her clothes off. He loved the smell of her, her scent, her taste, her hair, all of it just made him desire her more. She smelled of raspberries and cassadea, his favorite. As she pressured her fingers into his nipples more and more, his raging erection hardened to that of a rock solid metapod. He moaned and squealed in pleasure, obviously never being touched this way before by Michael, it was new and it was exciting. She increased the speed of her hands, rapidly rubbing his nipples to the core. As her speed increases, so does Matthew's constant moans. The rushing of rubbing was tearing his insides apart.. He was ready to burst. In a sudden motion of pure euphoric emotion and pain, Victoria ripped Matthew's nipples off in an aggresive motion, blood and lactate juice splurged from the missing chunks on his breasts, he screamed in pleasure, shooting ♥♥♥♥♥ from his small but erect ♥♥♥♥♥, it sprayed on to Victoria's thighs, leaking into her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ almost instantaneous. They both sat bolegged apart from each other, staring intently, but happily at one another. Jason closed the door and began to shake rapidly. He was not prepared for this, and he would live with it for the rest of his life. He slumped down against the wall, his hands in his face, confusion and anger filled his body.. He would never be okay again.","January 3, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"

I can't think of any one thing I really didn't like about this game, but I'm left (having finished it) with a desire to have those three or four hours of my life back.\n\nWhat's good:   It's cutesy, nintendoey even.  Music is oookay, the plot is ridiculous but as with most other games like this (e.g. Shatter or Arkanoid), it gives a nice framework. Basically, it's tetris's slightly braindead cousin.   Difficulty ramp-up is nice.\n\nWhat's not so good:  The 3d aspect makes it darned hard in fast moments to see which shape is in front of another one.  You rely on the little ring of lights to tell you where something's going to land.  But when there is a fast stream of things, the ring of lights only appears about 0.5s before the shape lands, which isn't enough time to rotate the disc.    The game is also pretty shallow... once you played the first three or four levels, you've basically got the gist of the whole thing.   When the two-toned shape "towers" came along, I thought "aha, here we go, this is where it gets fun", but that only lasts a few levels and then peters out.\n\nSo, all in all, it's an innoffensive little game, fun if you just want to waste a bit of time, and oh-so-easy to put down and pick back up again.   There's nothing intrisically bad about it. In fact, for a toy puzzler it reminds me a lot of the fun I had with original tetris.  It's probably way more fun on consoles and with other players.    I'm going to give it the thumbs up for originality and good presentation,  but it's come very close to thumbs-down for lack of any depth or genuine puzzle challenge.  However, I went in with no illusion that it'd be a modern classic, so thumbs-up!\n","August 9, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
