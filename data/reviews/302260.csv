The problem with the game is it is such an obvious port as it only is playable in a vertical screen as if your still playing on a phone. So whilst its painful to play on PC I cant fully say this game is bad because form the seconds I did play it wasn't bad but the fact its so poorly displayed its painful. But I's sure if you are playing this on mobile its fine but for another point its free on mobile but costs money here so take what you will from that but I cant recommend at all buying this on PC.\n\nAlso a side note they left the adds in for other apps so you know...","April 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

I'm not sure what the creature is suppose to be, but my guess would be a squirrel because you have to throw nuts down the trees. Your goal is to aim and try to hit all the yellow mushrooms in one throw. This could be accomplished by aiming the right way and the nut has to bounce off leaves to hit them all. There are different kinds of plants or insects that help you in your mission like piranha plants or bees. Obviously after a while the puzzles get harder and you will have to be more creative. You could see this game as a reversed "Peggle" (the game).\n\nI would only recommend this game for kids but even then Peggle would be a better choice for you.","November 17, 2014","false","0.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

The game offers in game achievements, but not for Steam.  The graphics are simple, almost to the point that its just drab.  And the sound...well, if i was on a road trip and i had the choice of Justin Beiber, or this, i would kill myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/302260/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","Truffle Saga is a mobile game that somehow made it's way onto steam. But will you want to play it here ?\n\nWe play as Truffle. We need to destroy the pesky mushrooms by throwing acorns at them. It's just as random as it sounds.\n\nGameplay is really simple. You throw down an acorn and try to destroy the mushrooms and you can also collect crystals. But you can only use one shot.\n\nWhile the gameplay is really simple, controls are the reason this game is quite hard. It feels really clunky and it's really hard to aim. In later levels you can change the layout by flipping snakes, opening parts of level and use bees to bounce the acorn. But it's really tough with the clunky controls.\n\nGraphics are probably the only good thing about this game. It looks really cute and the art style is really cool but that's not saying a lot.\n\nThe soundtrack is painful. It get's so tedious and it could make someones ears bleed. My suggestion if you do play the game is turn off the music as soon as possible.\n\nThe game is really easy. Even the harder levels are pretty easy and with enough patience you can beat any level within minutes.\n\nThe game is also incredibly short. Even though there's 60 levels, I finished the entire game in 1 hour. If you do want you can try and go back and collect all crystals and all crowns, but no one would attempt that. The developer promised new levels (not that I want any) but nothing has been announced.\n\nThe game isn't buggy, but the controls are a big problem. It's hard to aim when the line doesn't go where you want it to go.\n\nOverall Truffle Saga is a horrible game and not worth your time and money. It's easy, short and not worth the money.  I don't suggest getting the game even at a sale. I give Truffle Saga a 2/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 25, 2015","false","1.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sm0w/recommended/302260/","sm0w","GARRETT SAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sm0w/","116 products in account","Let me just start off by saying. This game is a very fast paced, challenging puzzler that will test even those who consider themselves proficient at games such as, "Puzzle Pirates", or other popular AAA titles.\nThe goal of this game is to obliterate the Mushies. Now for those who do not read the lore of Truffle Saga or any of it's presequals let me just catch you up to speed on the current state of the world as we know it.\nIt's been almost 7 years since the first Mushie appeared. First, they were adorable and cute and the world embraced them as "pets" but they were far from that... After only two years, there was a mushie in almost every household in the world. Then one day, the mushies got up, and all converged on a single point in the world, that point, being the Bermuda Triangle. At the Bermuda Triangle, they all started.., It's hard for me to even describe.. attaching themselves to each other.. going inside of each other.. they created one giant Mushie. Since the Mushies made everyone in the world happy, everyone gave up on building weapons, nukes, etc.\n\nNone was prepared for what would come.\n\nThe Mushie was invincible. The weapons the world did have, did nothing to affect the "Mega Mushie".\n\nAnarchy Spread. This would be the end of the world. Not Obama, ISIS, or Twinkies going bankrupt, but the Mushies.\n\nWhen all hope seemed to be lost, humanity made it's final stand against the Mushie, when all of the sudden, the clouds erupted and a flash of gleaming light illuminated the battlefield.. Out of it came, our future lord and savior, the Red Lemur Fox.\n\nHe repelled the Mushie invasion and taught the humans how only acorns could affect these vicious cute beasts because they have an acute life threatening nut allergy.\n\nThe War still rages on in Truffle Saga.\n\nThe question is, will you be there if the Mushies decide to attack again?\n\n10/10 Game.","April 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","21","3","14","3","1"
