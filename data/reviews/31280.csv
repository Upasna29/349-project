It is available for €4 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night at the Inventory allows you to play Texas Hold'em with Max, Strong Bad, Tycho and the Heavy.\nSo what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. A Characters will sometimes use an item to play. If you beat that character, you will get that item in Team Fortress 2! While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!\n\nVerdict\n--------\nThis game offers a lot of fun for just €4. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!\n\nThis game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want all unlockable items you can be found at the Inventory for 50 hours.\n\nScore: 81/100","November 28, 2013","true","18.1"," 141 of 173 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","141","173","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/31280/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","A decent hold'em poker game, where you can win four items of Team Fortress 2 game (which is not of any interest for me) and listen a hilarious in-game chat of 4 fun characters: Max from Sam & Max series, Strong Bad from Homestar runner, Heavy from already named Tea Fortress and Tycho from Penny-Arcade(dotcom). All of them are lovable. It could be very relaxing, dealing cards, and listen idle, yet clever chat of those four. For some time, at least\n\nGame have only one downside: once you heard all the lines characters were going to say... and win all 4 items from them... it is getting bleaker. Losing colours and taste. And if you're an achievement hunter... well, I wish you the best of luck. Achievements in the Poker Night are very logical and good ones, but some of them are connected to winning the hand with certain combination. And yeah, to made complete of this game, you need to get a straight flash.\n\nWell, again, good sides:\n\n1) Proper, enjoying poker. If you set difficult level at hard, it will be quite challenging. No, you'll not win every hand with all-in tactic, like some other reviews said. You gotta try to be a good player. A cool and smart one.\n2) Not only you'll be playing poker with worthy opponents, but they'll be entertaining you in the process! And every of them has a different behavior, which you'll need to learn for make sure you're winning.\n3) From those of us who are playing Team Fortress, the items you'll win should be a good reward to play a night or two in poker.\n\nBad sides:\n\n1) No matter how clever and fun are the lines from all four your opponents, they are limited. And after you heard them all, in all combinations... it is not so fun anymore. And even beyond that point, sometimes, there are lines which feels out of order. Like when Heavy guy is folding cards before you, and then starting to banter you with something like "In Mother Russia you're quit when you're dead". C'mon, man, you're folded too!\n2) So the game wears off... but if you want it with complete achievements, you need damned staright flush! And that's a bummer. Chances to get that combination... not high.\n3) Finally, there are some stabilty issues, especially when you're trying to change skins of background. So after several attempts to change something, I decided to stick to the main theme, the reason of stability.\n\nI have two marks: "Khorosho!" (8/10) if you are playing for the items and not for long. And 7/10 - if you're collecting achievements and getting bored with all those repeating lines again and again.","August 24, 2015","true","50.8"," 78 of 94 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","78","94","14","6"

Maybe? Well maybe you should give Poker Night at the Inventory a try. Naturally, the addition of character antics slows the game down quite a bit, so if you want to really play poker, this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off. Additionally, the character AI is very predictable after you've played for a bit. Tycho is conservative, Heavy is aggressive, Strong Bad likes to bluff, and Max is aggressive to the point of stupidity. Once you learn their tendencies and tells, the game becomes very easy.\n\nIt's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of it. Good thing they made another one!\n\n73/100\nA great poker game for people who don't really play poker.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/31280/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","If you're looking for some long story about how Sam, Tycho, the Heavy and Strong Bad all ended up playing poker ... well, there's not much of one. It's just the four of them hanging out and playing at The Inventory, an underground club that supposedly has its roots in Prohibiton, but offers nothing more than a setting. And that's fine, because really, this game doesn't have a need for a story.\n\nVisually, Poker Night's a good looking game. The Heavy, Strong Bad and Max all use models from Valve and Telltale's games, respectively, and their animations are very smooth. Tycho's model, on the other hand, is brand-new, and oddly enough, he's the one who looks a little out of place from time to time. There's also a few graphical glitches if you move the game along too fast: in one instance, I couldn't see my cards for an entire hand because they never actually loaded. I'd folded too quickly and skipped to the end of the hand before the game could make the change, it seems.\n\nAnother cool little feature is that in the background, the characters will appear as you knock them out of the game. They don't do a whole lot, but it's kind of cool to see Strong Bad playing the arcade machine, or the Heavy at the bar after a bitter defeat at the table.\n\nWhere Poker Night excels, though, is in the chatter at the table between the Heavy, Tycho, Strong Bad and Max. The scritping and the actual voice acting itself is spot-on, a testament to the abilities of whoever's responsible at Telltale for writing this game's dialogue. Tycho's voice is a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it the more you play, until it seems natural.\n\nWhat's also great is that each character's quirks are also included in their dialogue: for example, there are Heavy's "funny" stories about summer camp that are actually quite morbid, and Tycho's obsession/lust over giraffes makes it into the game, the latter of which made me laugh out loud the first time I heard it. In short, they've nailed the spirit of all four characters perfectly. My only complaint is that they engage each other, but never really bring the player into their conversations. You kind of feel more like an invisible observer than a player at the table with these guys for the bulk of the experience.\n\nOutside of their clever quips, the actual computer players seem... well, I'm not sure how to describe them. Maybe a bit erratic? At times, they seem to take unnecessarily big risks or make strange plays, like going almost all in and folding. At other times, the AI seems to know exactly what the flop, turn and river cards are going to be ahead of time, and is able to make strong bets based on that knowledge. I know part of poker is that the game can turn on its head with the draw of the right card and make a winning hand a losing one. But in Poker Night, it feels like those sudden moments are, at times, manufactured by the game more than they would occur naturally.\n\nPoker Night's gameplay pretty much boils down to good ol' fashioned Texas Hold 'Em, the kind you see on TV. It helps a bit if you know what beats what ahead of playing this game, as it makes it easier to gamble, but you can definitely pick up how to play over time. Navigating the in-game interface to make calls, raises and folds is relatively simple. Plus, in addition to the new items, winning games unlocks new tables and decks to play with, giving you the opportunity to customize the game's look a little bit.\n\nOn the downside, there's not a whole lot else you can change. The AI has two difficulty options - normal and hard - and you can adjust the level of conversation that goes on as well as if it’s censored or not. But you can’t change anything about how much the buy-in is, presumably to keep people from somehow gaming the system to get the Team Fortress 2 items easily, what blinds start at, etc. Maybe adding in a few other options that unlocked once you had all of the items would have helped keep some replay value.\n\nAll this boils down to Poker Night's biggest problem: it gets repetitive very quickly. Once you've heard Tycho and Heavy's tenth Class discussion for the twentieth time, it loses a lot of its initial charm. On top of that, with no real options to modify the game's stakes, you're always playing the same $10,000 buy-in game once you have the new Team Fortress 2 items. Thankfully, Telltale's included the option to right click through any conversation as a means of speeding up the game's pace and perhaps saving your sanity. The only bad part, of course, is right-clicking takes a lot of the fun out of the game because you're not getting those interactions anymore.\n\nIn the end, for 4,99€, you can’t really go wrong, and this game delivers way more than the typical ultra-budget title. On top of all of the TF2 enhancements, you get the added fun of seeing some great characters in a funny setting. It's fun, it's cheap, and it gets you Team Fortress 2 upgrades while letting you play poker against a bunch of fun characters. It's a good game, even if you don't play TF2. The controls arent great and the poker isn't the best, but it's still a blast.","April 16","true","16.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","29","31","6","1"

Whether you're looking for a review made in 1 paragragh or in a multitude of them, I hope you enjoy the review(s).\n\nMoving along...\n\nI decided to do a small review on Poker Night @ the Inventory. It's a simple concept made for a simple video game based on a (simple on paper) complex card game called Poker which everyone probably knows.\n\nIf you don't... well... shame on you, because it's really f*ckin' fun! (Avoid real money bets though, there's a high chance you'll lose your car, dog, wife, house or kids with all the betting and stuff...)\n\nAnyways, Poker is nicely recreated in this video game format... mostly.\n\nYou play against popular video game franchise characters, naming Max (from the Sam and Max series), Strong Bad (I have no idea), Heavy Weapons Guy (from TF2) and that's it...\n\nThe dialogue is well done, it's funny at times and it keeps the mood going without boring you. The fact that the AI is solid for the most part also helps a lot. However, after a couple of hours, the dialogue WILL repeat itself over and over, making you skip it constantly after 3 hours of play, which isn't very good, as you can probably tell.\n\nThe gameplay is basic poker, you got your flushes, straights (and hom... bad joke, sorry), full houses (which you won't have if you play on casinos, more like "empty houses" hahaha, get it?! God, what's wrong with me?), two-pairs, your classic "poker" and more...\n\nEverything plays as it should... like a poker game...\n\nThere is one thing lacking though... and that is the possibility to bluff.\n\nYou can bluff, sure. I mean I did go "All-In" when everything I had was a "pair of twos" or an "Ace-High" and all the AI ended up folding. Bunch of chicken ♥♥♥♥♥...\n\nAnyways, it felt like luck more than anything else, bluffing is supposed to make you feel good, you can trick people into thinking you have a full poker of Aces when in fact, you only possess a joker and a Magic: The Gathering card.\n\nWhere do you think the expression "Poker Face" comes from? Exactly...\n\nThe lack of a bluff system (which no poker video game can ever do, I think... maybe "Next-Gen" can fix that, LOL!) takes away a bit of the strategy of the game. However, it's enough to make the game fun enough to play, to listen to the characters talk (Heavy and Max are awesome, Strong Bad came to me as annoying) and to generally, have a good time!\n\nAnd I had indeed, a good time! Even the luck felt PERFECTLY balanced to either f*ck me, or f*ck one (or more) of the opponents, not too unfair or fair for me. I actually remember ending up the very first round of the match going All-In alongside 2 other characters, which was hilarious!\n\n********************************TL;DR**************************************\n\nI'm dragging a bit here, so, sorry. Anyways, funny dialogue that can get repetitive after a while (but that's expected), nicely balanced luck (in my case), basic poker gameplay, nothing special to talk about the gameplay. And finally, you get TF2 stuff! Only problems I had were related to frustrating luck (some matches in a row just weren't clicking for me) and the lack of bluffing (quite impossible in video game format). OH! AND NO MULTIPLAYER!!!! WTF, TELLTALE?!\n\nSo overall, I had fun. The game costs (only) 3,99€, on sale, you can get it for 0,99€ or even less!\n\nIt's a perfect game to spend your time in work breaks (lengthier matches won't last more than ~45 minutes (and even that's pushing it!)).\n\nThe obligatory gaming industry scoring system for Poker Night @ the Inventory is an arbitrarily pointless 8/10.\n\nSmall review my ♥♥♥!

With added features, including gameplay based reactions and story based informative conversations between your playmates-characters from other well known games, Poker Night at The Inventory genuily creates a feeling of a poker tournament played with your friend as if you were really there.\n\nYou will hear a few entertaining and interesting dialogues at The Inventory club, sadly a lot not so interesting or exciting ones. After a while I clicked through the most of them just to let the game continue. Althought there are some precious and fitting ones. My favourite is this one said by Tycho, because I'm Czech and its nice to see we are not totally unknown to the world "Checking is lame. Unless you are Czech.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazher/recommended/31280/","Crazher","Crazher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazher/","3275 products in account","I am recommending this game solely for the humor between the various characters in it - they are, for the most part, witty and original, and their nicknames for eachother are great (Heavy calls Strongbad "Tiny Heavy", during some great moments). The only character I was very whatever about was Tycho, he comes off as a pompous annoying know-it-all, but it only gives the others an opportunity to crack wise at his expense.\n\nThe actual gamepay should be simple enough right? No. The poker mechanics are horrendous. On occassion you will find that a pair of whatevers will beat a flush, or any other weird combination. The actual gameplay has been riddled with bugs like this since release, and that was several years ago. This is the major downside to this game, but the humor completely makes it worth it nonetheless.\n\nAnother minor downside, if you can even call it that, is that the achievements are moronic. One achievement asks you to get a straight flush, the probability of getting that in Texas Hold 'Em "is approximately 0.0311% (0.0032% for royal flush and 0.0279% for non-royal straight flush)". Other such achievements include "Get a hand with 3 kings", "Get 4 of a kind", and so on. While sure, getting these cards would be quite an achievement, it is still a major nuisance if it is the only achievement you lack from having 100% of the achievements - even for someone (like myself) who does not strive for 100%'ing achievements, lacking that ONE achievement would make anyone want to go for it.\n\nNonetheless, game is recommended still, it is very funny and witty, and makes for a great pastime.","April 24, 2014","true","5.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","18","22","7","0"

If you are one of those people, or you're a fan of Sam & Max,  Homestar Runner, the Penny Arcade webcomics, or a poker player in general, I'd recommend this game to you in a heartbeat.\n\nThe story is as simple as who you play as: you are known as "The Player", a silent poker player who's arrived at the inventory to play poker with 4 other fellows. The Inventory is a secret poker place hidden from society in case those "in charge" decide to essentially ban Poker for a second time.\n\nThere you have it, that's the story: Nothing more, nothing less is known about you; the rest is playing some number of games of Texas Hold'em with the Heavy (tf2), Sam (Sam & Max), Strong Bad (Homestar Runner), and Tycho (Penny Arcade webcomics) for stakes of $10k.\n\nNow onto the aspects of the game:\n\nGraphics [9/10] - The graphics are their own personality, likewise the characters' models match their respective traits\nAssets [7.8/10] - I run a fairly average computer with a lot of memory left, yet I run at somewhere between 30-40 fps ingame\nAI [9.8/10] - The ai of the game is, I feel, unbelievably realistic\nSoundtrack [10/10] - The soundtrack is stupendous, I love it: I listen to this whenever I need think music playing\nAtmosphere [10/10] - Between the soundtrack, the dialouge from the characters, the game looks and feels amazing and almost believable to be sitting down playing poker with these characters\nOverall score [8.7/10] - The big killer for me was the fact that the second game runs much more smoother, despite having more stuff going on: other than that, this game would've gottten a 9.6/10","August 17, 2015","true","35.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","15","19","6","0"

This made me ask myself "If I don't buy items in TF2, why did I buy this game to get some TF2 items?" I suppose the answer is that I get to play a game in the process of obtaining those items, but the AI seems much too random in betting patterns to provide a truly enjoyable poker experience. Which means you are really just working to earn those TF2 items; and on top of that you have to pay money just for the privilege to work for them. I'd say buy this if you want to win the TF2 items, but if it's poker you're after there's surely better games out there. Or better yet just grab a real deck of cards and host your own poker night with your mates. 3 out of 10, would not bet.","July 30, 2012","false","5.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I played Poker Night 2 first and I felt bit spoiled here. You play with half the money then the sequel but you get to play with new characters at the same cost as the sequel. You play with Tyron (whoever the ♥♥♥♥ he is), The Heavy (Or Heavy Weapons Guy), Max and Strong Bad with the owner being the dealer which made me miss Glados as the dealer. I just miss her little insults she would make at you but to make up for it, it has a more friendly astmosphere to it. Instead of having Ash and Claptrap having a passive agressive talk with each other, You got The Heavy having a friendly talk with Max about his childhood which I like because it feels less compative and more a friendly match but with this, you get a lot more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThis game is more unfair to you since I somehow got a flush which then gets beat by someone getting a royal flush out of  ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and when you finally got some money, its very little. I mean, I won a match with a royal flush and get $900 from the main pot while THE ♥♥♥♥ING HEAVY GETS $380000 FROM THE ♥♥♥♥ING SIDE POT WITH A PAIR OF 2s. THAT IS JUST SO MUCH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. You can change the difficulty which is a ♥♥♥♥ing lie since you are stuck to normal and you can't change jackshit. You can change the table conversations which yet again does jackshit and you have to turn on the strong langauge which is just so stupid. Hey Telltale, I'm playing Poker by myself in my room. I highly doubt I'm a 8 year old who can buy stuff from steam by myself.\n\nThere is more to talk about but it's just more whining. I only recommend this if you like Poker Night 2 and want to see the characters and here more lines or want the poker version of Dark Souls.","May 9","true","1.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Lots of deck and table options, some with cool on-screen effects. Bantering between characters is funny, it's interesting to watch this motley crew come together under one roof.\n\nCONS: Weirdly laggy during the beginning intro. No display for your current hand means a potential win may slip by. There is no way to completely silence the characters, making their more long-winded checks and folds annoying (especially after a long time playing.) Texas Hold 'Em only.\n\nOVERALL: It's a shame people are brute-forcing this game for TF2 items and uninstalling.

Same thing over and over and nothing new other than winning 4 in-game items that only TF2 new players would want as they have no items of real value to put into their slots.\n-Conversation settings need to be turned on High in the Options menu to get the most & best conversations in the game.\n\nPros:\n-Cards randomization feels fairly accurate to real-life, something that almost all video games & poker sites stuggle with.\n-Cool poker themed game with a 'Rounder's NYC Feel.\n-With the conversation settings turned on high, surprisingly there are a lot of conversations where I didn't feel bored or even heard the same conversation twice in a full gaming session, and surprisingly colorful stories that was unexpected.\n-Has a nice optimization & action mechanics that's welcomed.\n-I waited a year until it went on a real sale and purchased it for $.80 cents for I & II.  Being 30 years old growing up during the arcade days, we spent like $10-$20 a day where that kind of money actually meant something of value, just on quarters in order to play 1 round on a arcade machine.  So I look at it as fair entertainment value for my money, even if i'll only play it once or twice in my life.  I knew this before purchasing it and decided to purchase it for the experience to see what it was all about and to say to myself I played it.\n\nIf u get it on an amazing $1 sale then feel free to pick it up for the exp, but you can also pass on this game and not miss out on anything in this current gaming era.\n★★☆☆☆ Mediocre Game - 2/5 Stars","April 15, 2015","false","27.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

The bots are Max from Sam and Max, Strong Bad from some Flash Web thingy and a WiiWare game, the Heavy from TF2, and Tycho who was from some comic I've never heard off. Each play differntly and you'll have to use skill and manipulation to beat them. Max is stupid and pretty much guess's but can surprise you at times. Strong Bad is also stupid but is in over his head a majority of the time but can also surprise you. Heavy and Tycho are actual threats as they play smart. Heavy is more aggresive while Tycho plays very strategically. They will sometimes give clues of what cards they haver such as Strong Bad slamming his head into the table when dealt a bad hand and Max may shake his right hand when dealt a good hand which is pretty hard to see. Winning games give you rewards such as new cards skins, table skins and the promo items for TF2 and Borderlands 2, Which is what I expect why most peopel got this game.

Then the real game begins but its just poker as we know not much to say here but fully perfect at what it does.\n\nIt is really addicting though now it makes me wanna play poker in real.\n\nGraphical options are many. On low still look pretty  considerable.\n\nSound track well luckily its very good and catchy as well, makes poker fun in another way.\n\nCharacters well some interesting one's here. you have heavy from (teamfortress 2) obviously. Max (the bunny) from sam and max. Strong bad from what i dont even know of actually. Lastly tycho from a comic or something.\n\nNow having all those characters really makes it into a interesting game, sometimes heavy tells you a story (though mostly hes sad awww). Max well the most least serious and mindless character here as when any of the other characters lose they always show angry faces while sam hes always cool. Strong bad well this is one angry fcker. And tycho well best way to describe him would be to say he always folds unless he has a very good set thus making it most harder to beat him.\n\nPromotional tf2 (teamfortress 2) and Borderlands 2 in-game items. A neat addition.\n\nOver all worth it?\nSurely if you are interested in a poker game at all this is worth a try. Good for tf2 items if you wanna get it alone just for that. A recommend game at only a price of $4.99 dollars fully worth its value.\n\nA poker game as the name suggests, well paced, polished,great ost,nice presentation and good graphics for its genre.\n===================================================================\n\nJoin our Giveaway Group and win every month over 2100 Steam Keys (Daily 70 keys) We love to share!\nClick to join our Giveaway Group!\nClick me and follow us as Curator","September 5, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

You play cards against the Heavy from TF2, Tycho from Penny Arcade, Max from the Sam & Max series and Strong Bad from the online series Homestar Runner. The dialogue and conversations that the characters have is quite interesting and funny, and the actual gameplay itself stays true to the original rules of Texas-Hold-Em.\n\nThe only problem I've seen so far is that the A.I. is a crapshoot and will sometimes unfairly beat you even when you think you have the best hand possible. With that said, with a basic understanding of how the A.I. works and of course, the rules of Texas Hold Em, the game becomes easy, perhaps a little TOO easy. The weapons and items themselves are quite unique-looking, despite only being reskins of the stock items.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's alright at the most, but there's not a lot of replay value to be had, and if you're just getting into it, I reccommend you do your research beforehand to see how to play it.","March 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

"Poker Night" is the kind of game you just wanna enjoy sitting back and playing. Sure it's unpleasant at times if these opponents pull a fast one on you and somehow come out on top with that River card out of nowhere, but other than having variable luck (mainly against your favor), it's a pretty fun game. Besides, there are times where the cards may go in your favor making your all-in bet not such a bad thing after all. There's amazingly cool graphics and wonderful dialogue to help add to the fun atmosphere. And the storyline behind this game is admittedly well-thought out.\n\nIf you're a card gamer that enjoys some good Texas Hold 'Em, or if you're a guy who just loves to laugh along with some crazy, witty one-liners from pretty well-known gaming/comic/television celebrities, this game may be right up your alley. Or should I say right up your winning hand? :P","January 20, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

All of the characters (except for Tycho, who I was honestly unfamiliar with at the time) together was just something so hard for me to process. I also somehow didn't expect it to actually be a poker game before release, so I had to learn it.\n\nThankfully this game is pretty easy to handle once you get the feel for it. I think most sales honestly came from TF2, where you get some unlocks from this game. But I honestly find myself revisiting this every now and then just to hear all the characters talk to each other. Especially Strong Bad and Heavy, like TF2 and Homestar Runner together was a huge thing for me. Almost disappointing all classes couldn't wear the Dangeresque shades, but I still wore them proudly.\n\nActually diving into it. Of course all the characters are amazing, granted you recognize them all. And it provides for some  amazing talk between them all (and you will eventually hear all the lines if you play it enough). You get rewarded (as said above) not only for TF2, but you can also unlock different tabletops and stuff. Granted you're good enough at poker unlike me. In the end, it's really just that. A well planned out and put together poker game with 4 very memorable characters all from different series.\n\nUnfortunately Poker Night 2 was an unfair mess that was truly annoying (at least in my opinion) and had sorta boring unlocks for TF2.\n\nForgetting about that. If you wanna see Homestar Runner, Sam & Max, Penny Arcade, and the TF2 universe combined just to play a simple game of poker, this is definitely worth the $5.","May 3","true","15.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Simple, the game dragged me in more than it should've and i say it's pretty impressing for a poker game! The Dialogue is hilarious (and hilariously stupid sometimes) the graphics are....pretty, they're not the best but not the worst at all. And the gameplay it's kind of good for a little poker game (i actually learned quite a few things from this game) and the TF2 items are just the cherry on top of the cake, you should buy it now if you ever wanted to see Strong-Bad, Max, Heavy and Thyco in the same game..well, there ya go!

The games setting is in a secret hideout known as The Inventory, where people from various medias hang out and play some poker games. You play Texas Hold Em and compete against Max from Sam and Max, Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner videos, Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Tycho from Penny Arcades and find out who will go big or go home. There's not too much to say about this game, it's just Texas Hold Em. Occasionaly someone will toss in a buy in if they are short on cash, being able to win the buy in will unlock an exclusive item in TF2 like Strong Bad's Dangeresque Too? Glasses and others. The dialouge between the players is always fun to watch after a hand. The conversations with Heavy and Tycho are funny as Heavy thinks Tycho is part of BLU Team as well as the ones with Strong Bad and Heavy and how Heavy finds him to be a smaller version of himself, or Tiny Heavy as he likes to call him. The one thing this game needs is Online play, it would be cool having more players in on the event or have them play as the multi-media characters. So in conclusion, Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun poker game where you don't have to waste realy money in order to play through the game. And since the game usually sells at $5.00 and features exclusive content in TF2, ya can't go wrong there.","December 2, 2013","true","28.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

The character interactions can be golden, especially if you pick up on the minute references in the dialogue.\nThe graphics do have some issues, with chips, cards and other objects failing to track the players' hands (namely the Heavy). There are also occasional issues when a hand ends and the characters' are in a conversation.\n\nHowever, these really are just nitpicks. The game is fun, and that's what matters really.\nFrom this game I learned how to play poker, which, while not the most useful skill, still makes you look clever.\n\n\nWas it worth $5? Absolutely.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/31280/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presenation\nPoker Night at the Inventory isn't the most authentic and packed poker experience out there, mostly because it was never meant to be, but it is among the most enjoyable virtual poker experiences while it lasts. You will be simply known as the Player, a newcomer to the secret poker club known as the Inventory, taking part in five players tournaments against four memorable characters from different franchises, not only in the video games industry, but comics and video series as well. You will play against Max from Telltale's own Sam & Max franchise, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Tycho from Penny Arcade, and the Heavy from Team Fortress 2, characters that have absolutely nothing common, yet still manage to lighten up the mood at the poker table. Poker Night's magic comes from the conversation between those characters, which consists mostly of jokes and references, and while some were meant to be little easter eggs for fans of a particular franchise, most jokes appeal to a generic audience, making them hilarious even if you're not that familiar with the characters. A short introduction to each of your adversaries would've been welcome to familiarize the player with their background, but instead the game chooses to introduce them to you as you play via dialogue, which feels authentic to a poker experience, but ultimately falls short on how much information you will actually get. Nonetheless, the jokes are what make Poker Night at the Inventory a fun experience more than anything else, but unfortunately the amount of dialogue doesn't go on forever, and one or two hours in, the game will run out of new dialogue and start repeating itself over and over again.\nRating: 6.5\n\nGameplay\nThere's no surprise or twist in here, what you actually play is poker, Texas Hold'em to be more specific, and that is another big reason why this game will become boring within a few hours; Texas Hold'em is the only thing you can play, and while it does work flawlessly and the game nails its table presentation, you will always play the same game, at the same location against the same adversaries, which does become boring quite easily. What will keep you playing, are the special items that each character will bring to the table as buy-in after a few rounds, giving you the opportunity to win them if you eliminate that character from the tournament; each character has one of those, making it four in total and winning those items will unlock them in Team Fortress 2, which is a nice thing if you play Team Fortress 2 as well. Even with that in mind, you can easily win those by playing a few tournaments which shouldn't take more than a few hours, and after that poker is the only thing that can bring you back, but then again, if poker is what you're here for, there are much better poker games out there. There are two difficulty levels, Normal which is the casual way to play Poker Night, allowing even the players who haven't played poker before to stand a chance by following the tutorial, and Hard which is the way to play if you really want an authentic poker experience, as the AI will become more aggressive, start bluffing and generally play smarter. The lack of additional popular poker modes such as Omaha Hold'em or Pineapple is what makes this game become boring so easily, as even with all the work put into making Texas Hold'em feel authentic, it's still the same game over and over again.\nRating: 5\n\nGraphics\nPoker Night at the Inventory isn't a visual masterpiece, but it holds on among other titles of its generation, and what really matters the most, the characters look amazing and authentic to their universe, while still fitting well in the Inventory's background. The animations are okay, but they do become repetitive as well after a while, and the visual effects, while kept to a moderate volume stand out well in the environment.\nRating: 6.5\n\nAudio\nThe dialogue is what matters the most in this game, and the best part about it is that all the original voice actors for those characters are here to voice them in Poker Night, with Gary Schwartz voicing the Heavy, Matt Chapman voicing Strong Bad, William Kasten providing the voice for Max and Andrew Chaikin voicing Tycho Brahe. The soundtrack fits the mood of the Inventory perfectly and the sound effects for card flips and chips movements feel authentic, making your poker experience enjoyable, even when the dialogue starts repeating itself.\nRating: 7.5\n\nExtras\nIt doesn't take more than a few hours to win all four Team Fortress 2 unlockables, which is probably where most players will end their business in Poker Night at the Inventory, but if you do decide to stay for a little longer, there are a few aesthetic unlockables such as new tables or decks, but apart from that, there is nothing else to see or do.\nRating: 6\n\nVerdict\nPoker Night at the Inventory is a fun thing to play for a few hours, which is more than enough considering its price; if you're a fan of one or multiple characters featured in this game, you'll have a great time hearing their dialogue, but if you're here for a lasting poker experience, there are probably better options out there.\nRating Overall: 6.3\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Poker Night at the Inventory at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=359","July 25, 2015","true","71.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It'd be easy to feel disappointed, or cheated by how short a time it takes to hear all the jokes, but the reality is that this is a small, five dollar download. It comes with all the polish I'd expect from Telltale, and while it only features Texas Hold 'em, is a really entertaining way to kill some time, especially if you want those TF2 unlocks. It may not be the best poker game out there, but it is definitely the funniest.

Regardless if you buy this one or the sequel, Poker Night 2, they are totally worth it. Often they are on special, so wait for those, but when they are grab them.\n\nThey serve the purpose of brushing you up on your poker game. No stress, and teaches you a lot if you can control your desire to "all-in" all the time :) The added fun is that you play against popular culture icons, who chat away with each other with funny anecdotes, but also have their own personal way of playing poker and poker talk.\n\nThe only downside is the reptitive looping of the anecdotal conversations. While there is a option to turn down the frequency of the anecdotes or even turn them off, there should rather be a option to turn off "repetition", such that once the library of anecdotes have been exhausted they stop telling stories...infact i'd buy DLC packs for more conversational anecdotes if they'd ever think of that.\n\nstill, a very enyable way to learn poker or simply brush up.","November 6, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't take long for the dialog to get repetitive (though there is quite a lot of it, it doesn't take long to play a lot of hands).  As other reviews have noted, the players have patterns that come clear quickly, and their betting habits are unreasonable... raising triple the minimum bet with very little chance of getting better than a Queen high.  It kind of becomes unfun because some of the patterns seem to be trying to give you wins.\n\nAs a TF2 player, but not a fan of the other franchises, I would have liked this more if it had been all TF2 characters.  It's interesting to see the Heavy while playing a card game.\n\nHonestly, I got it for the TF2 unlocks.  It's a fun game, but none of the AI seems very competitive, and the play becomes a bit dully repetitive about the time the dialog becomes repetitive.\n\nIt's fun to play for awhile and worth it if you catch it on sale for less than $5.","January 9, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't take long for the dialog to get repetitive (though there is quite a lot of it, it doesn't take long to play a lot of hands).  As other reviews have noted, the players have patterns that come clear quickly, and their betting habits are unreasonable... raising triple the minimum bet with very little chance of getting better than a Queen high.  It kind of becomes unfun because some of the patterns seem to be trying to give you wins.\n\nAs a TF2 player, but not a fan of the other franchises, I would have liked this more if it had been all TF2 characters.  It's interesting to see the Heavy while playing a card game.\n\nHonestly, I got it for the TF2 unlocks.  It's a fun game, but none of the AI seems very competitive, and the play becomes a bit dully repetitive about the time the dialog becomes repetitive.\n\nIt's fun to play for awhile and worth it if you catch it on sale for less than $5.","January 9, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brought back memories on the site. Most people played it because of the achievements and items they can get on TF2. But I played it because of more than just that.

You play Texas Hold ‘Em Poker with some of Telltale’s characters, those being Strong Bad (Home Star Runner), The Heavy (Team Fortress) Max (Sam and Max) and lastly, Tycho from Penny Arcade.  It’s fun to play even if you’re not familiar with the characters. You can change the amount of “gabbing” they do and the amount of  swearing as well, which helps if you’re there just to play poker and grab some ‘chievements. The UI is pretty nice, and it’s very clean and easy to adjust to. It’s easy to get into it, and if you spam that right click enough you’ll get the NPCs to shut up. The only downside to this game is that although it is advertised as playable with Mac, it is not. I’ve posted on the forums regarding this issue and no response. It would seem as if the developers have no intention of fixing this bug which is a bummer because this would be fun to play on my Facebook machine as well. There is no multiplayer, so you’ll be playing foreveralone style with some chatty NPCS. Wonderful take on poker, bummer they don’t seem interested in fixing the Mac bug, otherwise, totes worth the 5 bucks. 7/10","May 8, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lurabbi/recommended/31280/","lurabbi","Rabbi Himself","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lurabbi/","227 products in account","Internet comedian Doug Walker wryly noted that people eat up crossovers like candy. It's true. Some of my favorite movies are the grand world-building events where companies worked out a way to share profits, resulting in the magic of vastly different characters coming together. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is perhaps the best example of this. More recently, there was Wreck-it Ralph, a charming CG film from Disney that showed us the secret lives of video game heroes and villains and what they do when they're off the clock. It's this simple idea that gave us Poker Night At the Inventory, and the results are pretty hysterical.\n\nAs a poker game, it's fairly straightforward stuff. Make your bet, call their bluff, walk away with the pot, and so on. The real draw of this title is the banter between your opponents. Telltale Games give us Max of Sam and Max, Strong Bad from homestarrunner.com, Heavy Weapons Guy of Team Fortress 2 fame, and Tycho, the cynical webcomic star from Penny Arcade. There's hours of dialogue crammed into the game, all of it cleverly written to develop natural relationships between these unlikely poker buddies. Most of it is truly hilarious, and you get to hear something new almost every game. As a fan of homestarrunner.com, I've always loved Strong Bad and lamented the site's long-defunct status, so merely hearing new material from the be-gloved email maestro was a real treat.\n\nThere are multiple unlocks available, notably the Team Fortress 2 items that you receive when you successfully knock out one of the other players. In addition, there are several themed decks and tables that can change the look of the game in minor and major ways. All this coupled with the fairly difficult achievement set (some of them relying on pure card-dropping luck) give Poker Night a lot of replay value.\n\nThere are some cons of course. The most glaring one is the repetition. After a few hours of play, you'll hear the same conversations over more than a couple times. You can right-click to skip previously heard dialogue, or adjust the gameplay settings to make the characters less chatty. Other reviewers have complained that the mechanics are exceptionally poor for a poker game, but I disagree. However, I suck at playing poker, so my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. Still, I think that the players' styles fit their personalities quite well. Max is clueless, but he's dangerous as a wild card. Strong Bad isn't a good player, but he thinks he is, often bluffing his behind off and trash talking the rest of the table. Heavy is a decent cards man, but his pride can put him at a disadvantage, as he can feel that a big bet or raise is challenging his manhood.

The music completes the setting, with a lot of remixed versions of themes from the games represented, including Sam and Max and Team Fortress 2.\n\nBottom line, Poker Night At the Inventory is a game made by geeks for geeks. You may enjoy it just fine as an oddball card game, but if you're familiar with the various franchises involved and get a kick out of the idea of Strong Bad getting upset over being called a tiny Heavy, then this is well worth the $4.99.","July 31, 2013","true","19.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lurabbi/recommended/31280/","lurabbi","Rabbi Himself","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lurabbi/","227 products in account","Internet comedian Doug Walker wryly noted that people eat up crossovers like candy. It's true. Some of my favorite movies are the grand world-building events where companies worked out a way to share profits, resulting in the magic of vastly different characters coming together. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is perhaps the best example of this. More recently, there was Wreck-it Ralph, a charming CG film from Disney that showed us the secret lives of video game heroes and villains and what they do when they're off the clock. It's this simple idea that gave us Poker Night At the Inventory, and the results are pretty hysterical.\n\nAs a poker game, it's fairly straightforward stuff. Make your bet, call their bluff, walk away with the pot, and so on. The real draw of this title is the banter between your opponents. Telltale Games give us Max of Sam and Max, Strong Bad from homestarrunner.com, Heavy Weapons Guy of Team Fortress 2 fame, and Tycho, the cynical webcomic star from Penny Arcade. There's hours of dialogue crammed into the game, all of it cleverly written to develop natural relationships between these unlikely poker buddies. Most of it is truly hilarious, and you get to hear something new almost every game. As a fan of homestarrunner.com, I've always loved Strong Bad and lamented the site's long-defunct status, so merely hearing new material from the be-gloved email maestro was a real treat.\n\nThere are multiple unlocks available, notably the Team Fortress 2 items that you receive when you successfully knock out one of the other players. In addition, there are several themed decks and tables that can change the look of the game in minor and major ways. All this coupled with the fairly difficult achievement set (some of them relying on pure card-dropping luck) give Poker Night a lot of replay value.\n\nThere are some cons of course. The most glaring one is the repetition. After a few hours of play, you'll hear the same conversations over more than a couple times. You can right-click to skip previously heard dialogue, or adjust the gameplay settings to make the characters less chatty. Other reviewers have complained that the mechanics are exceptionally poor for a poker game, but I disagree. However, I suck at playing poker, so my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. Still, I think that the players' styles fit their personalities quite well. Max is clueless, but he's dangerous as a wild card. Strong Bad isn't a good player, but he thinks he is, often bluffing his behind off and trash talking the rest of the table. Heavy is a decent cards man, but his pride can put him at a disadvantage, as he can feel that a big bet or raise is challenging his manhood. And Tycho, as a character who actually plays a lot of games himself, is the keenest of the bunch, rarely going in for high-risk pots.\n\nPoker Night features lots of fun cameos from other Telltale and Homestar Runner characters, most of them quickly glimpsed in the opening cinematic. The music completes the setting, with a lot of remixed versions of themes from the games represented, including Sam and Max and Team Fortress 2.\n\nBottom line, Poker Night At the Inventory is a game made by geeks for geeks. You may enjoy it just fine as an oddball card game, but if you're familiar with the various franchises involved and get a kick out of the idea of Strong Bad getting upset over being called a tiny Heavy, then this is well worth the $4.99.","July 31, 2013","true","19.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Still, if you can, skip it and play the even better sequel.\n\nLong version:What can one say about a poker game? The computer deals you cards, and you try to win against a set of pre-determined AI players, that’s it.\nAs for the skill of the opponents, it’s standard. They don’t cheat, but usually play the check/fold/all in game, making it a bit hard to play against them intelligently; bullying is almost always the best tactic. They aren’t terrible, but you can always tell you are playing against bots.\n\nSo, why is this game better than any other poker game? Because of the writing: your opponents are characters from video games (and a comic strip that deals with video games), and they constantly interact with each other in well-written, humorous banter. There are hundreds, if not thousands of lines of dialogue, so it’s hard to get bored.\n\nStill, there is one reason I wouldn’t wholeheartedly recommend this game, one large disadvantage it cannot overcome: a sequel that is superior in every aspect.","April 29, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is relatively straightforward to play and serves as a decent poker simulator. Albeit it is a single player experience you will feel like you have friends in the cast of characters, as they bring their unique personalities to the table through playful dialogue. The dialogue is well done and entertaining to listen to although for individuals who intend to play a couple hours at a time, there is some repetition. Additionally this game offers easy to acquire team fortress 2 item unlocks as an added incentive, not that you should require it. This game gets a full recommendation from me, and is defnitely something worth picking up","June 9, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's no option to skip dialogue or animations, no shortcut keys for basic fold/call/all in actions, and the ui is generally pretty bad and exhausting for poker. The AI also doesn't appear to use any kind of machine learning.

This game has you betting and checking 'till you're the last one standing. Also, at random times, one of the characters might not have the money to join the game, so they put items up for grabs, and if you win them, you get them in Team Fortress 2. To win the items, you just have to knock them out. Max is the only one in the game that puts up two items, that are his Lugermorph and his badge (A Licence to Maim in TF2), Strong Bad puts up he pair of shades ('Dangeresque, Too?' in TF2). They Heavy puts up Sasha (Iron Curtain in TF2), and Tycho bets in his watch (Enthusiast's Timepiece in TF2).\nOnce you've got these items, the only other real objective is to get all the achievements, which is easy considering there is only 20 (15 without the item grabs).\n\nOverall, this game can be fun when on a plane trip, since it has character personallities, and doesn't have Multiplayer.\n\n9/10, amazing game!","March 26, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The characters are a little zany and are enjoyable to listen to if you're familiar with their backgrounds. However, I've also noticed that dialogue does get repetitive, especially in situations where most of the CPU players are busted leaving you alone with one CPU player.\n\nThe actual poker game itself is mediocre at best; the cards drawn do not seem mathematically random and AI is questionable. On the standard difficulty setting, if all CPU players except for one have busted, I've noticed that the you'll get dealt with pairs, Ace-high, or other favorable cards. Similarly, the last CPU player standing will often make stupid decisions (i.e. they'll go "All In" with a crappy hand while also having a lot of money left).\n\nTo further prove my point, I came all the back from only having $5k to beating Strong Bad when he had $35k. I've also won 3 tournaments in a row and have racked over $100,000 in this game's currency. In real life, I am terrible at Poker and can't win if my life depended on it.","May 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The characters are a little zany and are enjoyable to listen to if you're familiar with their backgrounds. However, I've also noticed that dialogue does get repetitive, especially in situations where most of the CPU players are busted leaving you alone with one CPU player.\n\nThe actual poker game itself is mediocre at best; the cards drawn do not seem mathematically random and AI is questionable. On the standard difficulty setting, if all CPU players except for one have busted, I've noticed that the you'll get dealt with pairs, Ace-high, or other favorable cards. Similarly, the last CPU player standing will often make stupid decisions (i.e. they'll go "All In" with a crappy hand while also having a lot of money left).\n\nTo further prove my point, I came all the back from only having $5k to beating Strong Bad when he had $35k. I've also won 3 tournaments in a row and have racked over $100,000 in this game's currency. In real life, I am terrible at Poker and can't win if my life depended on it.","May 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In this game you get to enjoy the many different funny dialogue from the characters Max, Strong Bad, The Heavy, and Tycho. However, if you enjoy Poker as much as I do you'll find the dialogue will become stale after a while if you play for extended periods of time. Though how frequent the characters chat can be changed in the options.\n\nIf you get Poker Night solely on the purpose of playing Texas Hold 'em I would advise against it as the difficulty is novice at best. Even the harder difficulty you'll find yourself winning quite easily if you're a somewhat seasoned player of Poker.\n\nUltimately, if you enjoy the humor and personalities of these characters and are a novice to Poker than this game is for you. If you're somebody looking for a Poker game, then I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. 78/100","December 8, 2013","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
