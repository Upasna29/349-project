It was followed by a sequel, Shank 2, released in 2012 for the same gaming platforms as the first game and to be honest you can see why they did the sequel (profit yes i know thats what your thinking-and YES that may be the main reason OK) as the orriginal is just such fun and a total blast to play through (i still need to get to the CO-OP though and play through thet yet).\nWill you play this if you havent allready,well if you like an action game that kicks ♥♥♥ and takes no prisoners at all then yes and if not then why not as its one of the best side scrolling beat,chop,kick,main,muttilate,eviscerate and blow the crap out of games that this reveiwer has ever played.","August 6, 2014","true","5.0"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","38","45","0","2"

It has it's own graphic style. There's a little bit gore and brutal scenes especially on the boss kills. You start with 3 different weapon classes, melee = chainsaw (yeah!) double pistols (akimbo style, you can fly during shooting in the air because of recoil wtf?) and 2 daggers to pounce on enemies. Somehow the movements and controls are a little bit clunky. I even experienced some lags with over 300 FPS.\n\nThe big plus is the strange atmosphere. The background music supports it much and feels like a neverending Quentin Tarantino soundtrack. The big minus are the controls and fights. Enemies are able to block gunshots and can dogde around you in the background. Mostly the gameplay is like in Double Dragon. (you can also finish a just local co-op campaign). Enemies with ridiculous names appear from both sides and you have fight them down to proceed. You can pickup some powerups (grenades, health) or special weapons (grenade launcher, flamethrower) but it's just rarely.\n\nThe hard mode is really very hard. Even if you manage to kill properly all enemies on the map. There remain these annoying jump sequences. Once you fall down you have to repeat the whole level (in hard mode there are no savepoints). Or you just get hit by a grenade on the slackline or accidently change sides on a climbing pole. Sometimes windows don't break if you try to jump through ...","July 14, 2015","true","5.9"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","22","26","2","3"

Button-mashing is inevitable and gameplay is repetative as the same enemies will attack you in the same ways. I never said that it wasn't fun though, as Shank pulls it off with such style that I really cannot find the gameplay boring. Sure the enemies will take a long time to kill and you will take some damage in the process but it's fair and will drop you health and extra weapons for your troubles.\n\nTHE GREAT\nGraphically I cannot find fault with Shank's aesthetic. The character animations are smooth, the character models are functional, the backgrounds (Silhouettes) do thier job and the scenery looks pleasing at the very least. Shank seems to break up the fighting from time to time by adding in puzzle sections which flows nicely and gives players hands a rest from the constant button-mashing. Mechanics of Shank are fairly simple with not too much getting in the way of redecorating the walls with enemies intestines, and on the topic of intestines it feels like the devolpers wanted this to be more violent in parts. I expected some gruesome deaths from enemies once I got a high enough combo which makes you feel that this game is censored. We'll get to that later.\n\nTHE UGLY\nIt's later. The story is absolutely terrible and it seems that the main character, appropriately named Shank is just out to kill the Big Bad because he doesn't lke him. I played the Steam version through to the second boss fight and then downloaded the Humble Bundle 4 version (Which I got a while ago) and noticed that the cutscenes had been changed to the point where the story makes no sense. I cannot understand why Steam would censor an M rated game, but I'm not complaining. The only other real issue is the fact that this game was made for the gamepad. It says so on the intro screen and shows it by having the default controls worse than my home country's rating system. These are two seemingly petty gripes but they really ruin the experince.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nDo you see how I've recommended this game? I've recommended it on two conditions. These follow:\n1- You own a gamepad as the default and customizable controls are terrible\n2- You don't care about the story/you watch the cutscenes through YouTube to grasp the story/you'll played this game on console and know the story\nThese are the only conditions I would recommend Shank and that's a real shame because I like Shank, I possibly even love Shank, but if I'm being honest then that's my recommendation to you.\n\nSIMILAR GAMES\n-Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken for it's crazy, fun, spam fest attitude\n-Mark Of The Ninja for the unique and eye-catching style\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","January 4, 2014","true","1.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

You walk, you pounce, you hack and slash. The beauty of it is that it has a comic-like artstyle of you doing all those things, which pretty much looks like you are the protagonist of an animated movie. You also feel quite "the man" while performing different sets of combos. The dodge mechanic is not overused like in shank 2, which keeps the game away from being tedious. Its weaknesses would be that it is a tad short, theres a lack of online co-op (even though you have the option of local co-op) and the gameplay is a lot more awkward with the mouse and keyboard, so you'd need a controller for a better experience. All in all, shank is more than a decent action platformer that will give you a good dose of hack and slash fun.

And now that I have played it, I'm sure glad I did. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I can tell it's going to be a real winner.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the game is the incredible art style. It's cartoonish, and some people might think that would detract from a gritty, blood-soaked beat-em-up, but it fits perfectly with this game. Shank's art style reminds me of Skullgirls or Guacamelee, just cartoony enough to make everything seem surreal, without feeling like a Mario game. The colorful landscapes and enemies that you encounter really make this game stand out.\n\nThe soundtrack is spectacular, and really adds to the depth of the game. Shank really feels great, and a big part of that is the exceptional music. The sound effects are great as well, really reminding me of old beat-em-ups like X-Men or TMNT with all the grunts and yelling and slashing.\n\nGameplay is a little complicated, because Shank is able to use several weapons and several different kinds of attacks. I've been playing this game with an XBox controller, and it feels very intuitive. The only thing I don't like is that at certain points of the game, it will prompt you to hit a particular button, but the prompt just shows a little cartoon of what the button does so it can be hard to remember which button to press. For example, to pick up items, you have to push down and lunge at the same time, and instead of showing "RT" for lunge, it's just a silhouette of Shank lunging. This is only mildly annoying though, because you will quickly learn what each button does and how to pick up items so it won't matter what the prompt looks like.\n\nSo far, the story is very well written and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. One complaint that I have is that there is no option for subtitles, so make sure your volume is turned up. I usually like to listen to music in iTunes while I play games, so this was weird for me, but the game's music is so good that it doesn't really matter anyway, you'll want to listen to the game's music.\n\nOverall, Shank is a very enjoyable side scroller with some platforming elements and a great story. If you don't mind a bit of blood (or a lot of blood, flying everywhere!) then I would consider this a must-have for fans of the beat-em-up genre. Shank plays like an old-style fighting arcade game, but with better graphics and infinitely better controls. If you're not sure if it's something you'd like, then why not grab the free demo and check it out? The whole game is only $10 full price, and you can easily find it on sale or trade with someone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

It has a fantastic presentation with a Mexican desert flavor, great animation, big boss fights, a plethora of different looking enemies and it is a 2D beat em up published EA (but people think its indie). Its just not fun. In an era full of Metroidvanias beat em ups such as Guacamelee, you will find Shank is more of a basic left to right sidescroller with very few ups and downs. There are no secret areas or even breakable walls with meat in them. If the original Castlevania had secrets, why not Shank?\n\nThe game has great controls, a quick melee button, strong melee button, a gun attack, a pounce button, grapple button, grenade button, block button and even a jump. It has everything that you'd ever want in a 2D beat em up. With all of that being said, it feels so monotonous. Your attacks feel very weak and each enemy takes an exorbitant amount of hits. The enemies are pretty smart, they'll block and roll through you to sandwich you between enemies. If they have enough distance, they'll pull a gun out and shoot. While there are a lot of different looking enemies, they all pretty much fall into a few categories. Standard foot soldiers, big brawlers, weapon users and dogs.\n\nThe game is very forgiving on normal mode. There are no lives, you just respawn pretty close to where you died. It is a welcome decision to do so. Of course, there is a hard mode too.\n\nThe problem with the game is that it gets dull really quick especially when you have the same attacks from start to finish. You gain no new abilities to keep things fresh. There are a few extra guns and strong melee weapons that you can use, but nothing feels like an upgrade, just a sidegrade. The bosses boil down to finding a weakness to exploit, pouncing on them and stabbing them.\n\nThere are light traversals to break up combat for a mere two seconds, such as climbing a brief fall, briefly hanging from a pipe or jumping platform to platform, but it just needed more of a break from the monotony of combat. It is so odd that there can be so much diversity in combat, and yet you can still just button mash your way to victory. Also what does it say about Shank's combat when the next game the creators made after Shank 2 was a stealth game? Another issue with the game is the blah music.\n\nThere is co-op to improve the experience, but having a friend around can improve any experience. I'm from an era of Nintendo and Super Nintendo beat em ups that have less combat options, but more enemy diversity. I just couldn't get into Shank.\n\nFinally, there will be plenty of sales if not game bundles with Shank 1 and 2. Just wait for the combo pack sales with $5 for both.","February 26, 2014","false","4.8"," 41 of 70 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","41","70","0","1"

Of course, MoTN only came out 2 years later, therefore, I expected Shank would have its shortcomings.\n\nNow, Shank is a fast-paced, action-packed side-scroller that reminds us of the good-old beat 'em up games from the arcade era. We proceed from one screen to the other while getting rid of dozens of enemies and eventually coming to a boss battle. At our disposal we have melee weapons (chainsaw!) and some firearms. While nothing fancy, making combos with all of our available items is pretty cool in the heat of battle especially when enemies are pouring in from every which way!\n\nThe game has cutscenes between the levels and a great accompanying soundtrack. While short (can be completed in a couple of hours), for hardcore gamers the hard mode is available offering an extra challenge by completely removing the checkpoints.\n\nThere are 2 things that make Shank stand out. First, we immediately notice that the game has a comic book art style - this was later used to make MoTN happen and Shank also has a sequel with similar graphics style. Now, the 2nd and perhaps most interesting is the excessive gore / violence the game uses.\n\nI found it a bit too much at times - I admit this is the game's style but even the cutscenes have some pretty gory scenes for no apparent reason. I understand the game later on underwent an upgrade and as a result of that some of the more violent scenes were removed / edited including some nudity.\n\nDon't go looking for a story here as you do not really have one. This is Shank's tale of revenge against his previous employer but it really is just a basis for killing a whole bunch of enemies (they never really elaborate on the story). This is not necessarily a problem as you are here for the chainsaw! :)\n\nTo summarise: Shank is a decent beat 'em up from Klei Entertainment which offers a couple of hours of entertainment if you do not really have any other game at your disposal. I look forward to completing its sequel! This is an easy pick-up - especially when discounted - just remember to use a controller!\n\n","March 26","true","3.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you did, you should be ashamed of yourself.  That movie was god awful and nobody deserves to play a game about that.  Did you find yourself thinking you'd want to play a game based on Mr. Trejo after you left "Machete"?  Well, that's a bit more understandable.  Plus, that's a lot what Shank is like!"\n\nWhen I say Shank is like "Machete", I mean it's violent and involves machetes.  The comparison's pretty direct.  In the movie, we get a few attempts at plot and drama sprinkled in a whole lot of action scenes.  Shank's laid out the same way!  You cruise through a Mexican villa occupied by your former crime lord boss and his goons, in search of revenge.   The game itself is pure beat-em-up in the mechanics department, which leads to straight forward game play that may run a little stale by the end of the game.  It's still competent enough to make for some fun in small bursts.\n\nI picked up Shank on a Humble Bundle for a measley $1; this game is well worth that.  I'd even say it's worth paying a good $5 for.  You get an okay story and plenty of action, though you'll get frustrated a bit when they start to spam you with the harder bad guys.  In small groups these goons are tough but managable, but when they through too many at you,  they can break the flow of your combo's you've been pulling off for awhile.

The art style in this game is damn near gorgeous and easily makes you forget that the actual graphics are not that great. Everything is clearly defined with sharp edges in this beautiful comic book style visual.\n\nThe gameplay is another matter entirely though. The first thing the game tells you is that it's best played with a controller, not a keyboard. An instant black mark on any PC game's record, port or not. Despite this it does play fairly easily with a keyboard setup, it might not as smooth as with a controller, but it'll do. The gameplay is a fairly basic side-scrolling brawler and not even a terribly complex one at that, most of the boss fights are almost reminiscent of quicktime events and fights against regular goons quickly turn into simple endurance tests with you hacking away waiting for the henchman supply to run out.\n\nA very pretty game but not a very fun one.

With Ennio Morricone music. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. Adds a lot of blood and violence. Bring the combo system of Devil May Cry/God of War. That's what playing Shank feels like. And I like it!\n\nThere are 20 levels, ranging from 4 minutes (boss stages) to 15 minutes long. You can choose between 4 melee weapons (plus your main weapon) and 3 range weapons, although you'll soon discover some weapons are useless compared to others (I never used the Chains a single time). 3 different attacks: one fast but weak, one ranged attack and one strong but slow attack. You can also throw a limited ammount of grenades.\n\nThe monochrome backgrounds match nicely with the atmosphere of the game, it's good to distinguish between different areas and it helps not to lose your focus from the enemies, but they make the stages feel empty sometimes. There are 11 cosmetic costumes to unlock. The game also has its own coop campaign (local only), which adds some extra hours of fun.","April 7, 2014","true","9.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You mix this all together to create fun and fast combat mechanics.\n\n+ A variety of weapons to fit your playstyle\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe boss battles are mostly the same. Each boss has similar attack patterns making each encounter feel more like a chore rather than a challenge\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Its main failing is that the game is very very repetitive. There is very little variety in the level design, thus every level has you beating up enemies, moving on to the next screen and doing it all over again.  The game is short clocking in at roughly 2-3 hours on normal and by the time you reach the end you pretty much had enough anyways.\n\nConclusion\nIt is a good first effort from Klei Entertainment, they have a unique artsytle and animation to their games which make them stand out but this game is a bit on the shallow side.\n","January 3, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I found a few bugs one of them being when you pounce and attack you can get stuck the only way to get rid of this is to restart at the last checkpoint or get damage from another near by enemy and this happened many times. The controls are quite confusing i myself re keyed everything so it wouldn't be a mess to play and control your character. The controller recommendaion is a bit stupid because the controls reset themselves so i just went with keyboard controls. It has a very short story around 3-4 hours depending on how good you are. There is parts where you climb up walls with your knife and i found this very clever. The user interface is quite good but i found myself having trouble when changing the sound volume and resolution.

Tight controls, interesting moves, decent weapon variety, and a nice artstyle. I personally found it enjoyably challenging, and a bit frustrating at times even on Normal difficulty, but I'm not really much of a fighter/brawler player so your experience may vary. The story was somewhat interesting but truth be told it was nothing revolutionary imo.\n\nIt's not without flaws, of course. Enemy variety is frankly not the most impressive. Also be warned the singleplayer story mode is very short. First playthrough only took me about 2 to 3 hours. There's some replayability if you want to try hard mode or unlock all the costumes, but frankly after you settle into a pattern of attack that you like, beating up very similar goons already becomes somewhat repetitive in the first playthrough so I'm not sure how many more I'd be interested in doing. There's a multiplayer campaign I haven't done yet, so maybe there's some meat to be had there.\n\nAlso the save system is automatic and stage based, and it's not always completely clear what the stage start and end points are. So if like me you decide you want a break after reaching a checkpoint and exit the game, you might find yourself having to repeat some content.\n\nAround 2 hours of my play time were actually alt-tabbed because I was getting a bit salty and wanted a break, but didn't want to redo the whole stage thanks to the limited autosave system.\n\nIt was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it, just be aware that this can indeed be a game you beat in one (short) sitting.","November 17, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story itself is a very shallow revenge plot, but I couldn't care less - it sets the mood perfectly.\n\nGood combat mechanics - 4 weapon categories: The mandatory melee weapon (Two knives), heavy melee weapon (machete, chain saw etc), ranged weapon (guns etc), and grenades (frag, mines, molotovs).  I did find the gravity a bit too weak though - it all felt a wee bit too floaty for my taste.\n\nThere's a good variation in enemy types and a boss in the end of each level, so even though you could argue the combat is fairly simple, I still found it varied, challenging and rewarding enough to keep me entertained for the 3 hours of gameplay the campaign provides. There's also a co-op campaign.\n\nThe gameplay using an xbox360 controller didn't feel quite as tight as I had hoped for. While the analouge stick is good for aiming the ranged weapon, it felt a bit too indirect/unresponsive for character control.\n\nGenerally it's pretty evident that it's a console port, as e.g. the devs didn't even bother hiding the mouse cursor during gameplay.\n\nI bought Shank1+2 at 75% off, and at that price it's just ridiculously high value for money, but even at full price it's a recommended purchase for fans of the genre.\n\n75%","January 27","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I will mostly compare this with Final Fight.\n\n- The art greatly surpasses Final Fight, but it's not a direct result of 20 odd years that passed between these two games. Shank tries to establish its own style that has been a good mix of Metal Slug, Western and Tarantino movies and executes it near flawlessly. The game's greatest merit is its art to be honest.\n\n- Lack of ridiculous ♥♥♥♥ to do or secret locations. There aren't any of them unlike Final Fight where you beat a car for no good reason but still a good amount of fun and something to achieve and try to set a record on. Compared to Guacamalee, lack of secret locations also can be more noteworthy.\n\n- Comparing stories, Shank and Final Fight both follow a cliche story about a woman but Shank does it a lot better and the story has a good amount of Robert Rodriguez vibe, which I found incredibly done. Also the characters are fleshed out a lot more, unlike Final Fight's bosses.\n\n- When it comes to gameplay, Final Fight was much more superior. All of your combos made sense and were devoid of button mashing. Also Final Fight tried to keep combos and attack moves a lot simpler but timing of them and the strategy used to defeat a number of enemies in an area mattered much more than button mashing.\n\n- Final Fight allowed you to trap your enemies to a corner of the screen and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, which made the game a lot easier than it could have been if you couldn't exploit this. Shank carries this trope to some extent, you will mostly be able to corner your enemies and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them except for bosses and some enemy types.\n\n- Some fights consists of throwing multiple waves of heavy enemies at you without having a chance to rest or save and it's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Yes, the game scenario makes sense for you to fight them, but having a 8-10 minutes of constant fighting and starting all over when beaten just feels unfair to me.\n\n- Responsiveness of the controls are sometimes ♥♥♥♥ed, which was purely perfect for Final Fight. I often wondered why my fighter insisted on shooting at the opposite direction or failed to grab one item in multiple tries. When it comes to dodging, controls ♥♥♥♥ up more and you find yourself standing in the middle of 5 large enemies.\n\n- I won't be able to compare this with Final Fight due to era's technical limitations but compared to Guacamalee the amount of gore in the game is just lovely and it is very satisfying to violently strangle someone with chains or how you behead bosses.\n\nAll in all, if you're interested in the genre or want something interesting, Shank can be a good choice when on sale and fortunately it goes on sale very frequently.","January 29","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm simply reviewing to state my interpretation. Shank is a revenge tale played in a 2D platforming brawler. Gameplay is somewhat comparble to the Devil May Cry series, with a standard attack, a secondary weapon attack and guns that can be switched on the fly, grapple and pounce moves, and a grenade to cause heavy damage. The combat is pretty simplistic, and often spammy, as mashing the standard attacks is sometimes the best way to deal with single enemies and small groups. That isn't to say there isn't some complexity with the fact that some enemies can shoot from afar, block or dodge your attacks, or perform unblockable power attacks. The majority of the combat boils down to managing gun shooters and grenade throwers while a handful of standard grunts and a "big guy" or two that require you to dodge or block their attacks. Platform segments are simple and are nearly automatic, but   can become a little annoying when you miss a grab point or are hit by a projectile mid-jump.\n\nThe game's simplicity is both it's main pro and con - it's a simple, very short story with easy to grasp controls and enjoyable "mindless bloodshed". It also means the game becomes fairly predictable and leaves most the game easily beat by "spamming main attack" or "spamming pistols" until you win (this will not always work though, and it pays to mix it up on tougher enemies and large groups). I beat it in less than 3 hours, which is crazy short, but I'm also perfectly fine with that because any longer probably would have outstayed it's welcome for me. (another backlogged title defeated!).\n\nYou won't find the new revolution in brawlers here, but you have a solid action title that's enjoyably mindless.","December 15, 2013","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So what is Shank? It is a 2D side scrolling brawler with comic book aesthetics and short elements of reactionary platforming.\nNeedless to say I started off the first level with a sour taste in my mouth and my judgments pre-rendered. After all of that, I’m not going to make a 180 and say Shank is great, but I got WAY more enjoyment out of it than I ever expected. The fighting felt to me like a run-and-gun adaptation of the combat found in Mark of the Ninja (a game I actually am quite fond of). While the platforming certainly picked at my nerves, the sections were short enough that I was able to push through them and keep playing. Helping matters was that Shank is an absolutely gorgeous game from an aesthetic standpoint. The animations are clear and well fleshed out, the cut-scenes are very rich and capture that comic book vibe, and the colors - while a bit muted for my tastes - are varied from level to level.\nIn the end, Shank is still a brawler. I don’t like memorizing combos and I don’t like how any fighting games handle. But I think in the end, that just says a lot for the quality that this game brings to the table. I’m not about to hand out my game of the year award, but Shank is pretty alright.","February 9, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well thats what I thought you said, so I recommended Shank.  In shank you use light attacks, heavy attacks, and fast attacks to build combo chains. Each attack uses a different weapon and there are multiple weapons to find, so far I have found myself using a variety of shank, chainsaw, pistol, and shotgun attacks. However I also have been using grenades and super heavy weapons e.g. the minigun whenever the situation calls for it.\n\nNow as you might have figured out there is quite a bit of variety in the ways you can kill enemys, thank goodness too, because otherwise the game would get boring pretty fast. Really there is not much else to shank besides playing through the story and moving on to Shank 2 if you liked what you just played.

The graphic style is nice. The vague story is a bad ripoff of Tarantino type revenge films. A mixed blessing is that it only takes 3 hours to beat. If it wasn't one of the cheapest games i've played since I had a NES, it probably only would have taken an hour and a half. The shortness of the game meant that I dealt with the frustration because I knew the end was in sight. If it was a 5-6 hour game, I probably would have quit after the first hour.\n\nThe combat system is just plain boring and too random. It feels like luck is almost as important as skill; sometimes regular hitting combos turn into grapples when you don't want them to, which gives other enemies an open shot at you. Different weapon combinations don't really have much effect other than a couple just being generally worse than others. Pretty much all difficulty comes from the game just throwing tons of enemies at you that throw grenades and shoot assault rifles rather than actually making the enemies smarter or requiring more skill.\n\nHonestly, it feels like they prioritized the look and style and added the actual combat as an afterthought with no actual idea behind it other than it should look cool. Kung-fu on the NES has much better combat IMHO because it's 100% skill-based. There aren't any unavoidable deaths, your character reacts predictably and it's never cheap.\n\nCertain levels have missles come at you from offscreen and pieces of ceiling fall on you, much too fast to be able to react to, which adds nothing but frustration and random deaths.\n\nPretty much all of the boss fights are glorified quicktime events. They all involve dodging and getting in the occasional hit that does next to no damage until the flashing "grapple now!" QTE graphic pops up, at which point your character does a specific attack animation. Each boss requires going through 4 of these QTE's to win. The devs got lazy, because even if you don't have a chainsaw or pistols equipped, your character wil still always use them for the QTE attacks.\n\nTo top it all off, the developers made the huge mistake of adding a bunch of terrible platforming, with a few notable areas where trial-and-error is the only option. The missles from offscreen appear in one stretch that is super frustrating, and at one point you actually have to shoot your guns at an offscreen enemy to prevent him from killing you mid-jump.\n\nAnyways, I LOVED Mark of the Ninja, with a similar visual style by the same devs, because at it's core it's a great stealth game, but at Shank's core is a random button-masher of a fighter mixed with a horrible platformer.","March 18, 2014","false","3.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/recommended/6120/","redwolf29","RedWolf_29","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/","145 products in account","What's it about?\nShank is a side-scrolling brawler by Klei Entertainment, who also brought you such titles as Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja. Playing as the titular protagonist, you make your way through several levels, slaughtering dozens of thugs and hired goons along the way on a one-man quest for revenge.\n\nHow does it play?\nThe undeniable strength of Shank is its combat. Within the first few minutes of the game, you'll be stringing together devastating combos utilising the weapons at your disposal. You have a light attack, a heavy attack and a firearm attack, and your heavy weapon and firearm can be swapped on the fly with weapons you pick up throughout the game. The fighting has a wonderful feeling of weight and impact to it, and hacking down the beautifully animated enemies is an absolute delight. The bosses are unusual and enjoyable to fight, though most can be beaten in more or less the same way. There is some rudimentary platforming involved in traversing the levels, which doesn't get in the way of the action too much.\n\nBecause the game was designed for console, it is highly recommended that you use a controller to play it. Trying to play with the keyboard will turn out to be an altogether fiddly and unenjoyable experience, since the buttons you need will be all over the place. Shank uses almost every button and directional input on the controller, and that amounts to 16 keys on the keyboard. Another bugbear is that levels often involve hazards and enemy placements that can lead to unfair deaths and frustration; the church level in particular, with its falling missiles, can be a nightmare to get through. There is also an odd glitch with the chainsaw's jumping attack in which you and your target can become stuck if you try to jump before the attack animation is finished, forcing you to reload the last checkpoint. It is also not a very long game; I finished it in less than three hours, so take that into consideration before purchasing.\n\nHow does it look?\nIn a word, gorgeous. Keli have a knack for nailing their art styles, and Shank is no exception. The character sprites are beautifully designed and animated, and serve to make the already great combat look and feel even better. The environments are equally gorgeous, though there are points at which elements in the foreground appear onscreen and obscure parts of the stage. This often happens in areas with enemies, which can prove annoying when you are fighting or being attacked in a place you can't see. Despite this little problem, the graphics are delightful to look at, and the resolution options mean you shouldn't have a problem getting it to run on your system.\n\nHow does it sound?\nPerhaps less impressive out of all of this is the sound design. The music mostly consists of loops of Mexican standoff-style tunes that fit the game very well, but can get a little repetitive after a while. The enemy shouts and grunts also get very samey (and for some reason, Shank's death rattle sounds almost identical to the Heavy from TF2). The various slashing and shooting sounds are well done, and the chainsaw in particular sounds like the industrial death machine it should. The voice acting in the cutscenes could have been better, but then again, the story is not what's important here.\n\nLong story short\nShank is a brutal, bloody and highly entertaining beat-'em-up from a highly talented indie studio. The combat is some of the best I've experienced in a 2D game, and the art style is both beautiful to look at and serves to add to the combat experience. A few problems here and there, but Shank is a game that is definitely worth your time and money.\n\nGood Points\nOutstanding combat system\nGorgeous visuals\nInteresting environments and bosses\nBad Points\nThe occasional game-breaking glitch\nSound design could have been better\nSome questionable decisions in level and art design\nMay be too short for some\nRedWolf Rating: 6/10 - Good","October 14, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can cycle through various guns and melee weapons during combat to make some lengthy chain combos. You don't unlock any abilities and you can't really juggle people in the air the way you can in Devil May Cry. This isn't too big an issue since the game is pretty short and everything seems to work well together in combat. Some fight sequences later in the game can become pretty tedious to get through, since you have respawning out-of-reach enemies shooting at you constantly form above while you try to hack through dozens of foes down below. Luckily, there aren't too many situations like this. The boss fights are pretty fun, each with their own attack pattern. Once you understand it, you can take them down pretty easily.

Fast-forward through two hours of spamming this move over and over and you have the casual experience of Shank. If you have a friend willing to join you in your jump-slashing spam spree, you can get another two hours out of the local co-op campaign, which was actually quite surprisingly long (about as long as single-player) and to put that much effort into a co-op campaign and make it local-only is somewhat baffling to me.\n\nAlso baffling is how the hard mode was handled. There are no checkpoints. Even the people who are really into this game admit that the hard mode is quite tedious and unfun. I'm all for arcade difficulty, and I would have expected a limited-lives system to come into play on hard mode, but you have literally one health bar to complete an entire stage. Ten minutes of gameplay in, and an enemy with a minigun can blow you to pieces with a stunlock-instadeath combo before you even know what happened. Hope you're good with the combat, otherwise you're going to repeat ten minutes of spamming again. This isn't even a pure beat-em-up, either. There are platforming sections, and the non-intuitive "hold right or left to advance, no matter what direction you're actually going" controls can easily send you plummetting to your inevitable instant death.\n\nThis is a hard game to recommend, but after watching a walkthrough done by someone familiar with the game's combat engine, I think it has a lot of potential for the diehard beat-em-up fans. If you liked other Klei games, particularly Shank 2, try out the demo and see what you think. Unless you're willing to keep replaying it, however, I'd wait for a sale if I were you.","February 2, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's just well designed and I liked the mechanics a lot.  It's reminiscent of old 2d beat em ups, or to a lesser extent Devil May Cry.  Story is, well, it's alright.  You're not really here for story time, though.  I very much enjoyed the animation style.\n\nThe most glaring flaw is that regular enemies just have way too many hit points.  Killing normal enemies is an absolute grind, and it takes so damned long.  It isn't fun to beat up on the same 3 or 4 dudes for a couple of minutes at a time.  The gameplay really feels like you should be plowing through these guys, and while that's what I wanted, it most certainly isn't what happens.  However, if you go into the game knowing this, it probably won't bother you as much as it did me.  I just hated sitting in fights wondering how much longer it would take.\n\nAlthough the bosses are colorful they can also be sort of frustrating.  For the most part the game demands that you figure out a special trick/tell to each boss and doing that isn't really easy.   Personally I don't think that the tells to what you need to do are obvious enough.  Example: I don't know what the hell I was supposed to do against the final boss, I ended up just brute forcing him because I couldn't figure it out.  It's possible to brute force the guys down, sure, but it takes much, much longer, which isn't viable in a game like this because of your limited healthbar.\n\nI didn't have a bad time with Shank.  It's an alright game, not great, not bad.  Could have been a lot better, but that really isn't saying anything.","July 10, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sure, it has an attractive art style and an enjoyable (if somewhat cliché) soundtrack but its core is the 2D beat-em-up gameplay. Be sure you have a controller you can play with as I can't imagine playing this with the keyboard (I used a PS2 controller).\n\nFor me, the highlight of Shank is its boss fights. Each one has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of. However, if you want more of a challenge or can't figure out the weakness, you have the option to whittle them down with normal attacks. While there isn't a huge variety in the grunts that you'll fight, I never grew tired of them because you steadily unlock new weapons that reinvigorate things and quite simply, the game isn't long enough to start getting bored. It also helps that you have 6 different attacks, a dodge/block button and jumping at your disposal as you combo your way to victory. There are some platforming bits that got tiring but fortunately the developers were smart enough to keep those sections short.\n\nThe story is a very simple tale of revenge that is entirely forgettable but serves its purpose to drive the action forward. The voice acting is equally adequate without being distractingly bad nor anything noteworthy.\n\nGiven Shank's short length it's hard to recommend at full price. But on sale or packaged in something like a Humble Bundle it will surely entertain you for an afternoon or two.","June 1, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

These kids clearly need to track down some OLDER films - not to mention read some comics (y'know, those things they used to make with PAPER) - and generally catch up on their "grindhouse" and "exploitation" history a little.\n\nFirst of all, before Robert Rodriguez got involved with Machete, there was Grindhouse, in which there was a fake PREVIEW for Machete.  Before that, he directed a little film (which bears an equal amount of similarity to this game) called Desperado.  THAT was a sequel-of-sorts to his very modest FIRST film, called El Mariachi.  We could then go on to mention that some guy named Quentin Tarantino started making (by-and-largely BETTER) films around the same time of somewhat same-ish ilk, and if we REALLY wanted to get pedantic we could acknowledge that there have in fact been DECADES full of movies directed by guys with names like John Woo and Sam Peckinpah without whom, let's face it, NONE OF THIS would have existed.  Oh, and then there's comic writers and artists like Frank Miller, who not only co-directed the film adaptation of his Sin City comics (with a certain aforementioned Rodriguez character), but whose distinctive silhouetted-action art-style (which he's been doing for decades) is co-opted more than once in the course of...THIS VERY GAME!  Which we should probably start talking about, in all fairness (since this is supposed to be a review of it an' all).  SO ENOUGH WITH THE MACHETE REFERENCES ALREADY, OKAY?!  The SEVENTIES were FULL of movies which could just as readily be cited as influences to this game.  And action anti-heroes were rapidly firing twin pistols back in the EIGHTIES, boys and girls, in ASIAN movies no less!  Anyway, enough geriatric ranting, on with the review.\n\nShank is good.  REAL good.  And kinda hard.  Sometimes REAL hard.  But is it unique?  No.  Just as its INFLUENCES (see last paragraph, just in case you missed it) aren't exactly brand-new, neither is the gameplay.  But is there anything wrong with this, when the game is by-and-largely good old-fashioned 2D side-scrolling beat-'em-up FUN?!  OF COURSE THERE ISN'T!!  I mean, I don't play many of these games these days, but just 'cause an idea is OLD doesn't mean it's inherently "bad".  Sure, it adds some SEMI-modernisms, like oodles of bloodshed and endearingly cartoonish visuals, but it's basically the same-old, same-old, albiet done WELL.  And there ain't nuthin' wrong with that in MY book.  Apart from some slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥/awkward platforming bits and a baffling inability to assign any of the buttons to the mouse if you choose to play with keyboard, there really isn't that much to complain about.\n\nWell, okay, one thing.  I actually got the ♥♥♥♥♥ and threw in the towel on the chapter immediately preceding the final boss battle, because I honestly do lack the patience these days to keep fighting the same twenty-seven guys over and over and over again in order to yet yet again reach that one bit where I keep dying, and the game's sudden, stubborn lack of check-points was forcing me to do just that.  Like I mentioned above, I'm gettin' old, so "beating" the VAST MAJORITY of the game is good enough for me, in all honesty.  A quick peek at a video walkthrough confirms that I didn't miss much, anyway.  Like I said...nothing truly new and ground-breaking here, but very solid entertainment for anyone with the patience and skillz (dat's skillz wit' a Z, ya'll) to see it through.  Guess I should try the sequel some time, too...\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.","December 10, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

If you are into that, this may be worth it for a playthrough or two.\n\nHOWEVER, as the advertised "old school 2D action"-title, Shank is pretty much a dissappointment. First of all, everything feels kind of floaty - I am not even sure proper 2D-hitboxes are in place, because certain attacks connect in a weird way while others sometimes do not, even though you would expect them to. The whole combo-system feels way too "buttonmashing" and ultimately is less effective than it should be. It may seem you have a lot of options, but ultimately, there are two attacks that are so incredibly superior to everything else - as soon as you figure it out, the game falls apart. What I am saying is, using jump-in -> tackle -> chainsaw on the small guys, it is (almost) an instantkill, and a jump-in -> chainsaw kind of auto-connects to the big guys, trapping them in an infinite loop they can hardly escape from. At that point, you pretty much keep repeating these motions over and over again. Occasionally you throw a grenade for good measure, but I never felt to really change weapons or mix up my playstyle because it is neither necessary nor helpful in any way.\n\nFrom here on, the game becomes obviously very samey, as every encounter is pretty much the same deal (except bossbattles) unfortunately, enemy variety is lacking as well and doesn't help the game stay fresh - even the moogs that get introduced later on easily fall victim to the aformentioned "easy kill"-technique and aren't all that different from the bad guys you encounter early on. Every now and then they throw in a laughably simple platforming-section that breaks up the fights - but these are not saving the game from feeling repetetive and ultimately boring.\n\nBossbattles are a mixed bag too, some bosses glitched out on me (the final boss got caught in a loop and I defeated him with neutral jump + chainsaw repeated forever) others were a nice diversion with some distinct patterns. Talking about glitches, there were several occasions when the game decided to glitch out on me, enemies getting stuck, animations breaking or stuff not unlocking despite meeting the criteria (like getting a 150+ hit combo), when first starting the game - I couldn't use my controller ingame, it worked fine in the menus though.\n\nOverall, SHANK is way too mediocre as a game, failing to stay fresh til the end despite being just about 3hrs long. If you dig the grindhouse-style, it might be entertaining enough for you - but if you are looking for competent oldschool-stuff you have to look elsewhere, SHANK tries but ultimately fails.","January 26, 2014","false","3.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The campaign of the game is very short lasting about 2 hours, a little extra if you hunt achievements. Don't expect the story to be overly complex. The main character, titularly named Shank, seeks vengeance for the death of his girlfriend, Eva. You go from shady locals within the mob cartel finding answers from npcs and bosses alike.\n\nBoss battles are well executed and are similar to bosses in the Mega Man series, as you must become aware of attack patterns and noticeable weakness very quickly or face a quick death. Shank contains a variety of weapons to choose from such as the iconic dual shanks, chainsaw, and shotgun, alongside throwable environmental items.\n\nShank is a grindhouse influenced beat-em-up that utilizes fast action combat with bloody animated mayhem. If you're looking for a quick brawler to play with, you can't go wrong with Shank."","July 29, 2013","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fighting and gameplay in the game is really smooth and fluid with all the combos you can do. While traveling to each destination it was very smooth and everything seemed to work together really well. There are custom skins to unlock while playing the game after you have completed certain tasks. The story was awesome and the cut scenes looked like a high end cartoon. The multiplayer aspect was just for local play and is alot of fun to play with a friend. But the co-op can be completed by your self with two controllers. I highly recommend this game, its action packed and alot of fun to play.\n\n","August 19, 2012","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like Metal Slug and similar games, this might just hit the spot.  Gameplay is pretty intuitive - you have your shanks, a heavier melee weapon of choice, and a gun of choice.  There's a bit of simple platforming but mostly cutting down groups of enemies.  The story is pretty basic - badass guy who lost a loved one seeks revenge on those who betrayed him - but the artstyle and animation make up for it.\n\nComplaints? It's way too short!!  Nearly all the bosses behave similarly so that can be a tad repetitive.  Multiplayer is local only.  But that's it - you should try out this game when you can, especially if it's on sale.","September 22, 2014","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is unacceptable, as I've purchased it for PC, and I expect it to be played as such. Despite this misplaced excuse of a warning, Shank can be played and enjoyed with the keyboard. The controls and combinations aren't too pitiful, and you will be able to execute most of them as soon as you get used to how the mechanics work. The artwork is well done, in a comic book style setting. The voice acting is okay for what it is, but you should not expect them to be excellent. Even though the game is violent, the overall atmosphere is quite mild and cartoony. The story isn't very original nor is it interesting, but it does fit fine with the overall presentation and game play style. Even though Shank attempts to go back to the glory days of early to mid 90s Beat 'em ups, it comes off as unpolished and sometimes inadequate in some forced platforming elements. There is very little variety between the levels and enemies, and once you get acquainted with the moves, Shank gets increasingly repetitive in all aspects, and you will be hoping for a quick finish to the game. After a very short while, it all looks the same, feels the same, and plays the same. The unlocks don't add much at all, and there is very little to be gained with the weapons the game makes available to the player on a permanent basis as you progress through the story. The boss battles can often drag and do not offer any true challenge or difference in game play in comparison to the rest of the enemies. There is very little charm in Shank, in comparison to games of the same genre from earlier generations. It's button mashing without any skill or strategy whatsoever. The music and setting are akin to stereotypical Southwestern United States, and this provides the player with slight immersion to the theme, albeit a basic one. The general concept would have been better suited for a short animated film instead of a shallow and slightly subpar game. Tedious fight mechanics coupled with poorly designed boss battles makes for a forgettable and passable gaming experience.\n\nShank is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was developed in comic book art graphic convention mixed with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez style as well as great sound effects and appropriately feisty soundtrack. This game features plenty of enemies to be brutally exterminated with heavy melee weapons like chainsaw, some firearms and grenades. I really like cool and simple combat system in this production (attacking, dodging and combos) but, unfortunately, there are moments too easy for old school players like me when you need to jump out from one place to another (and parts with climbing or slipping etc.). Furthermore, Shank is an awfully short game. It is good that several challenges are quite difficult and you are also able to increase the difficulty level by selecting hard-core mode. A nice addition is simple a little bit stupid plot with a grain of salt and some dark sense of humor with plenty occasions to shed blood.","April 29, 2013","true","6.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

However my biggest problem with the game is the story, i dont like how linear the story is, i dont like how it has no real originality and the "plot twist" if you could call it that at the end, was not surpising, at all, I guessed the plot twist as it happened. while the gameplay to me is okay, thoughout most of the game I'm not sure why Shank is doing what he is doing, i dont know who that lady is in relation to Shank. I just really hate this story because it feels like no effort was put in the story.

Shank shank shank!  Whenever I see this game I think of Borderlands and Moxxi's second husband and leader of the prison gang.  I suppose it's not a terribly bad thing that a game makes you think of a better one.  This game is not bad by any means.  I really enjoyed this game and once I snag my wireless controller from work, I'm gonna play co-op with my wife.\nThe game pays homage to the Double Dragon/Streets of Rage style of gameplay, but ramps it up a notch to awesome.  This a solid beat-em-up with a variety of weapons at your disposal.  The fighting, after you beat the game, almost takes on a zen-like quality as you mash 'n slash your way through to the the final showdown with Cesar.\nGraphics are hand-drawn style animations that are sharp, crisp, and fluid.  The game is fun to watch and even gives picture-in-picture style display to peek in on the action somewhere else.  The music is appropriate for the mood and will push along the story in a poignant but not overbearing way.\nMy only real complaints come in the controls department.  I find the handling to be a bit sticky, not as accurate as I would expect from the genre, especially with the wide range of moves at your disposal.  For example I would pounce on a person and start beating the hell out of them and while I'm on top of them I will either aim left or right and shoot to take out others nearby, but I have to be extra deliberate with the button presses for him not to shoot in the wrong direction.  The same could be said for dodging, juggling, and shooting up or down.  I hear they totally revamped the controls for the second and that fact alone is enough to drive me to play the sequel.\nI managed to beat the game in under four hours, but with the achievements, modes and unlockables, you could easily spend a whole weekend with the game and get your money's worth.","April 22, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally i found the keyboard layout just about ok to work with. graphically it is fine and the range of moves quite amusing in part and with platform elements thrown in with many jumps and running aspects mixes things up. boss fights are varied in difficulty and how well you adapt to the keyboard layout will determine your outcome. I bought this in a sale for £1.99 and if you do not own it this is a great price to pay for it. made it so far on normal difficulty to what i see as close to the end hope to complete soon.","November 10, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is mainly very fluid and responsive majority of the time, but occasionally I've noticed it not respond properly to my attacks or dodges, but it doesn't happen all that frequently.\n\nThere's a few cutscenes as well to explain the story, but it's not super in depth as you'd expect, but obviously this game is more about the combat than anything else.

The same can't be said for the actual gameplay however as balancing problems and oftentimes "floaty" controls hamper the overall experience. The biggest problem lies with enemy behaviour imo as different types of enemies tend to be proficient all-rounders rather than highly specd in their field. As a result you will witness weird stuff like strippers/light-type enemies blocking  buckshots/heavy attacks with their bare hands, etc. This makes the game feel more cheap than difficult at times.

Some people complain that Shank's combat is repetitive and gets old fast. I agree with that it is repetitive but that is the point.\nThe game wants you to aim for the highest combo you can muster, what better way to do that than repetitive combat? To get that 300 hit combo you need to practice practice practice! That’s the only way you are going to get some satisfying and brutal moves.\n\nCombat is this game’s best asset followed immediately by its art style. Its animated comic book style is something to behold.  The animation quality is top notch and it will hook you in with the frequent cut scenes.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the good points end.\nBosses are uninteresting and follow an easy to see pattern. One you figure out how to dodge everything, bosses simply become bags of HP that take forever to die.\n\nThe story serves only to push the character forward. A tale of revenge for Shank to use as an excuse to cut through hordes of Mexicans without a second thought. I will say though, without the story, the game wouldn’t be as enjoyable. The story allows for some graphic cut scenes that just make you even more blood thirsty! Which is a good thing.","November 25, 2013","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chez/recommended/6120/","chez","Chez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chez/","241 products in account","This game should've been a shoo-in for a recommendation. A classic side-scrolling beat 'em up with a graphic novel feel set in the Mexican underworld featuring machetes, chainsaws and epic wrestlers? What could go wrong?\n\nFirstly, the good. The game is pretty gorgeous, nicely stylised backdrops and beautiful graphics generally. Over-the-top gory action is par for the course, with you cutting through legions of troops with guns, blades and grenades. Whilst the game warns that it plays better with a gamepad, it's still perfectly playable on a keyboard, with enough move combinations and enemies to keep the game interesting. There's even a passable storyline!\n\nYet something went awry with the game testing. There are only two difficulty modes. The easier one is so straightforward that the game only lasts just over an hour. Although the learning curve is pretty well planned, there aren't many tricky sections, the boss fights feel like choreographed cutscenes, and you're more likely to die from learning where the pitfalls are or being hit by a random projectile. You'd think the hard mode would fix these issues, making the game more challenging, but whilst the bad guys have indeed been beefed up and the fights become much more tense as a result, more importantly each level has to be completed without checkpoints! Since some of the levels are over 10 minutes long (one even includes a mini-boss fight halfway through), there's just oodles of frustration waiting to be had here attempting the missions over and over, only to fall down a hole you didn't even know was there after 10 minutes of playing and have to restart.\n\nOverall a decent little game for the price, especially if you can pick it up on offer. The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay entertaining, and there's even a little local co-op which I haven't yet tried. But the fact that this game only comes with game modes for children and masochists and nothing in between makes it difficult to give more than a borderline recommendation.","December 16, 2013","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shank and its sister sequel Shank 2 were developed before Mark of the Ninja and does not focus on straight stealth like Mark of the Ninja did, but full on action with the same art style and same bloody action\n\nThe story basically shows us a guy named Shank who was tasked in killing his wife but was followed by some other gang members of Cesar where they kill his wife and leave him left for dead, this storyline made me say that it is something roughly around Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill volumes (which I highly recommend watching!)\n\nThe game is exteremly short, homing in at around 3 hours. But it does have its good and bad sides. Bad, because it is extremly short but good because it does get repetitive after a while. Shank 2 apparently suffers with the same length problems homing in at around 4 hours long (checked via howlongtobeat.com), thankfully Shank does offer a New Game+ mode as well as a multiplayer campaign... but sadly, I don't have any friends to try it out :(\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and made me remember playing Mark of the Ninja (I played Mark of the Ninja before Shank) as well as Disney cartoons, only Disney's cartoons are less bloody than Shank is. The animations are also really good, from the sword play to the gun fighting\n\nThe controls are very annoying on PC and it shows that Shank was originally developed for Xbox and then horribly ported onto the PC, it is impossible to play it on a keyboard, so much so that I had to plug in my controller to play it properly, and if you do happen to have a controller, I highly recommend playing with it as soon as you start. No wonder the game highly recommends playing with a controller when you boot up the game, it wasn't joking...\n\nThe music and sound effects, are okay but nothing memorable\n\nYou will die, a lot, thankfully there is a fair checkpoint system in the game. The voice acting was okay but nothing special, it does suffer like Mark of the Ninja's voice acting, some good, some bad...\n\nI had fun playing Shank, even though it did have its fair share of problems here and there, but on the whole, it was a really good action game. Hopefully, its sequel would have ironed out most of the problems Shank had... hopefully...\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","November 15, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And as you sit there listening to Carlos ravage every orifice your mother has to offer, you stare longingly at the barely function arcade machine across the room; and reach deep down into your pocket to find the single quarter you have been given to buy this months food for yourself and your little sister. You slowly slide the quarter into the machine, savoring every last moment of the cool touch of currency between your fingers. Click. Thud. Plop. The machine springs back to life and fills the dreary room with a warm yellow glow. You quickly grasp the joystick tightly with your right hand and sprawl your fingers across the brightly coloured array of buttons. For the first time in a long time the sorrow, hatred, and hunger subside as you are filled with a sense of hope and the indescribable feeling of happiness that you had begun to believe was purely myth. And as you hack and slash your way through an endless barrage of enemies you realize that the game is infact ♥♥♥♥. You know this from first hand as you often spend many nights sleeping in the putrid liquid waste of the homeless. Hope and happiness quickly turn to despair and self loathing as you realize playing this game is in fact worse than living your own life. The sad hungry eyes of your little sister glare up to you and your soul fills with regret and shame as you know what little you had has been squandered and you are now without redemption. You slowly walk to the custodial closet and grab an extension cord from off a shelf. You kiss your sister on the forehead and tell her that you will always love her. You close the door and take a deep breath. The sound of a sharp snap reverberates throughout the hotel lobby and is quickly replaced by an ominous silence. The arcade machine makes a few electrical cracking sounds and in white letters across its screen displays the ever familiar words, Game Over.\n\nThis is what playing Shanks is actually like.","March 20, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shank shank shank!  Whenever I see this game I think of Borderlands and Moxxi's second husband and leader of the prison gang.  I suppose it's not a terribly bad thing that a game makes you think of a better one.  This game is not bad by any means.  I really enjoyed this game and once I snag my wireless controller from work, I'm gonna play co-op with my wife.\nThe game pays homage to the Double Dragon/Streets of Rage style of gameplay, but ramps it up a notch to awesome.  This a solid beat-em-up with a variety of weapons at your disposal.  The fighting, after you beat the game, almost takes on a zen-like quality as you mash 'n slash your way through to the the final showdown with Cesar.\nGraphics are hand-drawn style animations that are sharp, crisp, and fluid.  The game is fun to watch and even gives picture-in-picture style display to peek in on the action somewhere else.  The music is appropriate for the mood and will push along the story in a poignant but not overbearing way.\nMy only real complaints come in the controls department.  I find the handling to be a bit sticky, not as accurate as I would expect from the genre, especially with the wide range of moves at your disposal.  For example I would pounce on a person and start beating the hell out of them and while I'm on top of them I will either aim left or right and shoot to take out others nearby, but I have to be extra deliberate with the button presses for him not to shoot in the wrong direction.  The same could be said for dodging, juggling, and shooting up or down.  I hear they totally revamped the controls for the second and that fact alone is enough to drive me to play the sequel.\nI managed to beat the game in under four hours, but with the achievements, modes and unlockables, you could easily spend a whole weekend with the game and get your money's worth.","April 22, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, it's not worth forgetting. The heavily styled art and fluid animation is a blast to look at, even when you know that you're just refighting the same enemies with more health later in the game. Thankfully, they also get smarter and better placed, although this isn't nearly as apparently until later in the game. Another interesting thing about this game are the bosses, the first few bosses require you to grapple at significant moments in their patterns. After the Butcher, all of the other bosses (minus two larger ones) will require you to have mastered the combat system. Considering that the game is difficult even on its easier of two difficulties, it's a good challenge.\n\nThere are a few annoying moments involving some utterly cheap programming, but it's a good game all the same.

No really, that's it.\n\nNot bad for what it is, but it is fairly obvious that this is an XBLA port. As such, the game will give you a warning that it can not be fully enjoyed without a controller. It plays fine either with controller or with keyboard.\n\nApparently there is more back story in Co-Op mode, but it only plays on Split-Screen, I had to give that a pass.\n\nStory lacks closure, and there are a couple parts that the game plays "Gotcha!" with, and basically forces you to die so you can reload the last checkpoint and avoid the hazard. Obviously not an option with Hard Mode, which gets rid of all checkpoints.\n\nAchivement unlocks don't add much, and weapon unlocks during game tend to be less than stellar. You'll settle on what weapon set you like fairly quickly.\n\nWould not buy as is, if steeply discounted (Say, around the 3-5 dollar level), might be worth a purchase  to kill a couple hours.","October 6, 2012","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And as you sit there listening to Carlos ravage every orifice your mother has to offer, you stare longingly at the barely function arcade machine across the room; and reach deep down into your pocket to find the single quarter you have been given to buy this months food for yourself and your little sister. You slowly slide the quarter into the machine, savoring every last moment of the cool touch of currency between your fingers. Click. Thud. Plop. The machine springs back to life and fills the dreary room with a warm yellow glow. You quickly grasp the joystick tightly with your right hand and sprawl your fingers across the brightly coloured array of buttons. For the first time in a long time the sorrow, hatred, and hunger subside as you are filled with a sense of hope and the indescribable feeling of happiness that you had begun to believe was purely myth. And as you hack and slash your way through an endless barrage of enemies you realize that the game is infact ♥♥♥♥. You know this from first hand as you often spend many nights sleeping in the putrid liquid waste of the homeless. Hope and happiness quickly turn to despair and self loathing as you realize playing this game is in fact worse than living your own life. The sad hungry eyes of your little sister glare up to you and your soul fills with regret and shame as you know what little you had has been squandered and you are now without redemption. You slowly walk to the custodial closet and grab an extension cord from off a shelf. You kiss your sister on the forehead and tell her that you will always love her. You close the door and take a deep breath. The sound of a sharp snap reverberates throughout the hotel lobby and is quickly replaced by an ominous silence. The arcade machine makes a few electrical cracking sounds and in white letters across its screen displays the ever familiar words, Game Over.\n\nThis is what playing Shanks is actually like.","March 20, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shank is the name of the protagonist who vies for revenge who uses his trusty shank along with heavy melee and firearms.The gameplay is a typical beat 'em up with depth in controls, ranging from various grabs and a slew of move and combo possibilities. Shank has well made animation. Set in a Western theme, the backgrounds reflect typical senarios with grit. Characters are wonderfully animated and have varying designs. The boses at the end of a section are huge and massive or proportional to Shank depending on the strategy used. Cutscenes use the animation style and in some parts, small panels show scenes while in fighting. The music ranges from Western background music to a fuller movie-like score. The game is a bit short, I clocked in at almost 3 hours and the fighting could get repetitive. One warning though, the game is a bit bloody and gory. The game is best used with a gamepad, and I used my Xbox 360 controller.","January 14, 2012","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The same can't be said for the actual gameplay however as balancing problems and oftentimes "floaty" controls hamper the overall experience. The biggest problem lies with enemy behaviour imo as different types of enemies tend to be proficient all-rounders rather than highly specd in their field. As a result you will witness weird stuff like strippers/light-type enemies blocking  buckshots/heavy attacks with their bare hands, etc. This makes the game feel more cheap than difficult at times.

Lots of enemies and lots of blood, with some sexual themes here and there, so it is not for the kiddos.  If you are going to play this game, you better make sure you have a controller, because the keyboard layout requires Mr. Fantastic fingers to use.  But if you want a larger challenge, skip the controller.  Shank begins his quest with just a few weapons, but more are obtained as he progresses.  Here is a weapon break down.\n\nDuel Pistols: have a good firing rate and good distance, but do not do a lot of damage so the larger enemies and bosses will barely notice them.\n\nShanks: Primary attack.  Don't do much damage but are fast.\n\nChainsaw: Does a lot of damage but is slow.\n\nShotgun:  Does a lot of damage but is slow and does not have good range.  Is very effective against large enemies.\n\nMachetes: Faster than the chainsaws, but does less damage.\n\nUzi: Fast firing rate and good distance, but not so powerful.\n\nChains: Slightly slower than the mahetes but do more damage.\n\nKatana: Fast with good range and does some decent damage.\n\nGrenades: Shank starts every level with three but can hold up to five.  A throwable explosive that can damage or even kill enemies at a distance.  Should be used wisely.\n\nThe game can get challenging and sometimes can get boring.  It is reccomended that Shank is played in spurts.  On normal mode, when Shank is defeated, he respawns nearby with full health.  But in Hard mode, there are no checkpoints. which means that every death sends Shank back to the start of the level, and the enemies are tougher than before.\n\nThe bosses are fun to fight and have a stragety on how they are to be defeated, but some bosses feel like more powerful copies of previous bosses.\n\nOverall, if you like a beat em up, are okay at the sight of blood, and know how to get tactical in battle, Shank is a good game, but should be bought on sale.\n\n","January 11, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And with a bit of time and as more skills you get. You realize you can actually kick ♥♥♥ in that game. And really play it badass.\nWhen the usual game becomes too easy they added an hardcore mode which is really challenging\n\nAs you advance in the game you are actually surprised by how stylish are the graphics.\nIt feels like an animated comic book.\n\nThe story is there only to keep you playing and could be summup in 3 words. But the cutscene are very stylish, not long , just enough to give you a break to relax your fingers.\n\nThe whole "machete" atmosphere is totally there, the absurdity balances out the violence. The music maintains that mexican feeling. It's never ridiculous but it's very absurd and I like that.\nThe design and animations are very nicely done and you ve got plenty of combos and ways to manage your different weapons.\n\nI did not feel any lag on the input. As some people were complaining it was my only fear while buying the game.\n\nDevs managed the difficulty in a subtle way so you can play it noob or hardcore.\nAs a die and retry, anyone can finish that game and i suppose have a nice experience. As it s long but no so much, not enough to become boring.\nIf you wanna play it badass and not get killed once you can too.\nIf you're kinda old and like that oldschool beat'em all arcade difficulty challenge, you ll get it. Thx to the hardcore mode :)\n\nTo linux users:\nThat game performs well on linux :) few minors bug with the controller, not related with lag input.

You can switch out each of these on the fly (there are 4 heavy weapons and 3 guns), though they have to be unlocked progressively. The game gives you new weapons seemingly the MOMENT you get used to the previous ones. Combat is ridiculously fast paced: the game constantly throws enemies at you, and you have to block, pounce, shoot, stab, and slice through your opponents at light-speed.\nMovement is equally well done: you can run up (nearly) any wall by climbing with your shanks, you can swing off of lamp posts and other hanging objects, you can slide down inclines, and other parkour game staples. Seeing this in a 2D space may seem like a horrible idea, but trust me, it's great.\nThe story is kind of cliche, but it's seriously unpredictable. You really don't understand what's going on until halfway through the game, as the backstory is slowly revealed through flashbacks, and the final flashback isn't until the final stage of the final boss of the final level.\nIn short: it's a Mexican drug cartel action-romance-tragedy-mystery.\nShank also includes a separate local co-op campaign and controller support (in fact, the game works better on a controller.)\nIf you have 10 dollars to spare, or want to play a 2D game, or just want a hell of a good time, pick up Shank.","December 11, 2012","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only gripe was how suddenly it seemed to end but it isn't a short game, it was I was having such a blast and so much fun it seemed to end quickly.\n\nShank took the best of Contra, Final Fight and Devil May Cry and blended them into a Spanish man with goheatas tuffer than tantainium. With the platforming action of Contra minus the one hit wonder blending in all the close fist combat of Final Fight and the Devil May Cry complments of swords and dual guns. Then lets throw in some chain guns and literally chains for the fun of it.\n\nThe graphics are nice, sweet and smooth and this game allows you to chain attacks is many, many creative ways with a nice splash of blood with every attack. The music falls nicely in the Spanish realm almost going western and you can easily see this game going down in Mexico. Between the punching, hacking, slashing and shooting if you say this game isn't violent enough? Man I don't even want to think of meeting you cause you're scary.\n\nRecommend this game? I'd recommend that you are crazy not to get it.","November 10, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shank is a bit short, but the story is okay for this B-movie game. Toss in a great soundtrack, and you get immersed in a gory underworld of hitmen, strippers, and drug lords.\n\nThe controls are kinda clunky and take getting used to. This was definitely designed with the console in mind. The glaring issue is the developers didn't include online multiplayer...your buddies have to be with you on the same computer.\n\nThere's quite a few hard-to-get achievements, along with a bunch of stuff to unlock. And Hard mode is HARD. Like Battletoads meets Contra hard. Add these together and you got a game with quite a bit of replayabilty.\n\nOverall, Shank is worth the low price.

And with a bit of time and as more skills you get. You realize you can actually kick ♥♥♥ in that game. And really play it badass.\nWhen the usual game becomes too easy they added an hardcore mode which is really challenging\n\nAs you advance in the game you are actually surprised by how stylish are the graphics.\nIt feels like an animated comic book.\n\nThe story is there only to keep you playing and could be summup in 3 words. But the cutscene are very stylish, not long , just enough to give you a break to relax your fingers.\n\nThe whole "machete" atmosphere is totally there, the absurdity balances out the violence. The music maintains that mexican feeling. It's never ridiculous but it's very absurd and I like that.\nThe design and animations are very nicely done and you ve got plenty of combos and ways to manage your different weapons.\n\nI did not feel any lag on the input. As some people were complaining it was my only fear while buying the game.\n\nDevs managed the difficulty in a subtle way so you can play it noob or hardcore.\nAs a die and retry, anyone can finish that game and i suppose have a nice experience. As it s long but no so much, not enough to become boring.\nIf you wanna play it badass and not get killed once you can too.\nIf you're kinda old and like that oldschool beat'em all arcade difficulty challenge, you ll get it. Thx to the hardcore mode :)\n\nTo linux users:\nThat game performs well on linux :) few minors bug with the controller, not related with lag input. My xbox 360 usb controller in kinda mapped stupidly before i enter and exit the menu a few times, and then it works. The game never crashed or bugged in any other way.","January 16","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You go right, jump, hack, shout and punch hordes of enemies. There is 20 single player levels for about 4-6 hours of gameplay and 2 player local co-op (2 controllers) for another 3-5 hours.

With his trusty chainsaw, pistols, and shank, he sets out on a bloody journey.\n\nThis sidescrolling beat-em-up is exactly what fans of the genre expect.  Tight controls with numerous and varied weapons that have their own strengths and weaknesses, dozens of enemy types, beautiful comic-style graphics, and a storyline even Quentin Tarantino could appreciate make this a game to pay attention to.\n\nShank’s bloodthirsty rampage will take him across about a half-dozen vaguely Latin-inspired stages, each with their own visual flair and memorable boss battles.  New weapons are gifted frequently, and you’ll enjoy learning how to string them together into absurdly long combo attacks against the seemingly never-ending waves of enemies.  Given the quality of the art and design, it isn’t too much of a negative to say this game is quite short: I beat the whole thing in under three hours.\n\nThere is a co-op campaign that details the backstory of Shank’s initial betrayal and how he ended up in this mess in the first place.  Yes, a co-op campaign that is actually separate from the main story, but still impacts it!  More games should take that approach.  It is only available in local mode, so you’ll need a real life in-person friend to play it.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely gorgeous.  Crisp, clean and excellently drawn characters make every boss fight memorable.  The waves and waves of enemies in between them also look good, and every single enemy is animated in their own unique way.  The music is likewise extremely well done, adding another welcome layer of drama to the mix.\n\nKlei Entertainment nailed it with this one.  I have a few minor quibbles with it, like the fact that some enemies attacks are telegraphed way too late for you to be able to react to them, but overall it is excellently made.  This is a great way to spend an afternoon or two, getting revenge for lost love by way of chainsaw and shotgun.","April 5","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
