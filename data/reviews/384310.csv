"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsterjenn/recommended/384310/","monsterjenn","monsterjenn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsterjenn/","93 products in account","Just completed the game. Took about 10 hours from start to finish, though I restarted at one point so my whole playtime was longer.\n\nShort version: I liked it. It’s got a nice visual style. It falls somewhere in between a casual game and one of those that takes forever to learn and takes over your lfe. It's definitely more complex, difficult and well-made than a casual game. I was impressed by the way everything was presented in a very accessible way, despite the mechanics actually being fairly involved. I wouldn't replay it (mostly because there doesn't seem to be much else to uncover), but thought it was great while it lasted. It's actually harder in the first half than after (basically once you’ve unlocked all the research it gets a lot easier, probably a little too easy). Even still, the developers still have a few tricks up their sleeves to keep things interesting at that point.\n\nBasic Premise\nIn Dead in Bermuda, you control eight characters who are stranded on a Bermuda island after a plane crash. You assign each person two tasks each day, collect and use resources, and manage their various maladies. The goal is to survive, explore the island and find a way off it. The characters each have vastly different stat attributes and various relationships with one another (there’s a husband and wife, father and daughter pair, etc.).\n\nFor the most part, this is a management-style game. To a smaller extent, there are small quests, dialog, but much of this is pretty linear, so you have limited control over it. There's also some plot twists that may come up also that complicate things a bit, once you're further into the game.\n\nGameplay\nYour main points of concern are: their stats/skills, their maladies (fatigue, hunger, depression, sickness, injury), their resources, and relationships. Their stats, skills, maladies, relationships with each other are all interrelated and correlated in various ways and impact their effectiveness at tasks. Managing these elements is at the heart of the game, and striking a good, complex balance is what the game does really well.\n\nTo survive, you need to manage their maladies – if any reach 100%, that character dies. Ideally, you want to leave the island with everyone! As you research, you will gain access to new tasks which give you access to new resources or easier ways to produce certain resources. Meanwhile, you're also exploring the island, which consists of 100 plots, which nets you resources and sends you off on various quests. The quests are pretty simple and don't significantly affect gameplay, but I thought they were fun, and you meet some colorful characters.\n\nOne big plus for me was how the main points of concern shifts as the game progresses. For example, at first, finding food is your main problem to contend with. However, very quickly, you notice your sicknesses are building up and things you were ignoring before might kill you. (Which is why I had to restart, haha) But as soon as you sort that out, then other concerns take over, etc. Kept me on my toes.\n\nTo win the game, you need to explore the island, and I won’t give away the rest, but let’s just say yes there's a way off the island. In terms of strategy, it doesn’t have a huge effect, but it brings some variety into the mix.\n\nDifficulty\nI would say that this game is much harder and more interesting in the beginning half than the ending half. The hardest part is staying alive the first 15-20 days. Since you have limited access to resources, you have to be very strategic. I loved the first half of this game. Thought it was delightful and interesting and a very healthy level of difficulty. It’s well-paced and well-designed.\n\nThe second half or so, for me somewhere around 50 days in I think, gets a little tedious once you have researched everything and have consistent access to all resources. The quests provide some entertainment to get you through it. (The plot twists are also thrown in there, which may impact your strategy as well, but they involve a little more guesswork than I'd prefer. Not my favorite aspect of the game.)\n\nReplayability\nThere’s not much variation from game to game, apart from some randomness in the locations of occurrences when exploring the island and personality modifiers for the characters. As far as I can tell, there’s no new content that I’m missing out on by not replaying it, so I think the replay value is pretty low. I wish there were at least alternate endings depending on how quickly you finish the game or something, but whatever.\n\nOverall\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game, even if it was a little of a grind towards the end. For me, it hit a sweet spot of being both strategically complex and also accessible. Even though I would not replay it, I thought it was well worth my time and money. Definitely one of the better games I've played in a while.","August 28, 2015","true","16.9"," 93 of 100 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","93","100","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiftySlug/recommended/384310/","ShiftySlug","Shifty Slug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiftySlug/","2925 products in account","Dead in Bermuda is a Survival/Management game, where you the player get to control 8 survivors who are stranded on a island because their plane crashed. I know what your thinking, another survival game. But i can tell you that this game is far different from all those other out there, and that’s a good thing.\n\nDead in Bermuda does a lot of things different, for instance you get to keep not one person alive, but eight. And that is where the management aspect of the game comes to live. Each character has their own stats on what they are good at, and what they are not so good at. Sending out a character with the scavenging skill out to explorer, will not give you the best results obviously. So you need to be careful on where you send your survivors to. There is also a bit of a RPG style to it, as you can also level up your characters during your play session, and increase their skills.\n\nThere are a couple of things you can do during a single day. each day allows you to take 2 actions for each character. During the morning you can send people out to scavenge food, wood etc. And then again during the mid-day. So each part of the day takes a turn. Setting your priorities is very important in such a game. During the evening you get to divide the food for the entire party. And i really love how they did this, because with a lot of these survival games, a character takes a absurd amount of food needed to survive. in this game they are very happy with a normal single meal. You have different choices on what to give each person. a small meal which brings the hunger bar down to 10% to 20% or a bigger meal that does 20% to 40%. There are also smaller bite size snacks that will help with the lower percentage hunger. But in my opinion this is a very cool and realistic method. Obviously if you do not feed them, their hunger bar will rise higher and they will then need more food to survive.\n\nYour goal in this game is of course to survive as long as possible and while doing so you get to research items and craft them for your base or for your exploration missions. Having people explorer the island you are on will reveal new locations where you can find items and other things to interact with.  Besides the normal stat bars, your characters also have other bars that need your attention, cause it’s survival game, so not all happy times. For instances you got to keep track of their fatigue when they are doing tasks. Their depression bar, which goes up when they see dead bodies or other party members talking bad stuff about them. But having a rest and let them talk to other people in the group will lower those bars again. I could go very in dept in to the stats and bars, but i am sure you get the point to it. keep the bad stats down, and increase the good stats. Another thing i just mentioned i really like about this game, is the interaction the susrvivors have with each other. You really get to learn who they are, and what is on their minds. A story is being told as you play a long. And that is something you do not often see in such games.\n\nAnother thing about this game that stands out is the graphics style. A 2D hand painted look, which looks beautiful in my opinion. Also the music in this game is very soothing to listen to, from relaxing moments, to the more intense ones. It really captures you in that moment.\n\nBut don’t get me wrong, while it looks beautiful and seems easy enough by my comments about it, it is a pretty difficult game as well. My first couple of play through i reached around day 13 and 15 before everyone died. Well who knew you would need water to survive. So a lot of trial and error here. But it is very worth it to play it again and again, because every day something new can and will happen. From what i could tell so far it has a lot of replay value.\n\nFor me personally this has been one of the most surprising games to come out this year, and i can full heartedly recommend this game to anyone, especially if you are into survival or management games.","August 27, 2015","true","4.8"," 70 of 87 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","70","87","0","8"

The 8 survivors from the crash must find a way to rally themselves, survive, and eventually escape the island. Sounds simple enough, doesn't it? Well, it is not!\n\nAs I usually do in my reviews, let's take a look at the good and the bad about this game.\n\nThe GOOD:\n1. The artwork is very thematic, the models are great and the locations that you will visit are unique.\n2. The characters in the game (the 8 survivors) aren't just names in a spreadsheet - every single one of them has a story, a personality, a pattern of behaviour and/or an agenda that they will follow throughout the whole adventure.\n3. The interactions between the survivors are very interesting to follow and read. It is a story of friendship, intrigues, stupid remarks, psychotic outbreaks and a lot of heart, all in one neat package. The interactions also vary, based on what kind of state the adventure and the person is, which is a very welcome design decision.\n4. Every character has a skillset that is randomly determined at the start of the game, without deviating too far from their personality.\n5. The is an RPG progression in the game, which is comparable to that of The Elder Scrolls franchise - the more you do a certain activity, the better you get at it. However, you also get a number of skill points to distribute based on the Intelligence of the survivors, which can lead to various "builds".\n6. The survivors also gain various character traits based on what is happening during their adventure. They can be either positive or negative and you have no control over them.\n7. It is very easy to relate to one or more of the survivors, which forms a deep connection between them and the player. You will love and hate some of them, or all of them.\n8. A good challenge - the game is very challenging, especially until you manage to get a good survival system up and running. Once you do, there are still factors that can ruin your adventure, which I find extremely important. This lets the game transcend the simple point and click adventure.\n9. A nice base to look at, which changes depending on the time of day.\n10. A fool-proof system - you get a warning about pretty much anything that could result in a game over, which is a very welcome addition to the game.\n11. You need to make a number of very, very hard choices, from who gets which meal to who gets to live or die.\n12. Good value for the money - it will take you at least 10 hours to get used to the game and win,  and even more of you want to have a second go at it and unlock all the achievements.\n\nNow let's take a look at the BAD, or the things I found lacking or I didn't enjoy in the game.\n\n1. The game has a very steep learning curve which may irritate you on a number of occasions.\n2. The story is... passable. It's not the best out there but it's not the worst. I could tell you more, but I don't want to let any spoilers out.\n3. Luck plays a huge factor in this game. While better skills result in better percentages to succeed, the almighty RNGesus might still make you look like a fool - for example by failing a 99% chance to succeed roll.\n4. You have no control over the traits your survivors gain, meaning you can sometimes end up with a guy who gets easily sick, hungry, and tired at the same time, which is not a pretty sight to endure.\n5. The English in the game is sometimes a bit wonky, misrepresenting a fact or two in the game.\n6. If you are a sensitive person, you will not like the fact that you might sometimes have to send someone to their death or see them perish because you were forced to choose one survivor over the other.\n7. The base, while looking pretty, seems quite outstretched, making you move the screen left and right a lot. While the devs made a few recent changes to remedy the situation, it is still a slight annoyance.\n8. It seems that there is a problem with some achievements - while I am not an achievement hunter, it might irritate some players. The devs are hard at work to fix them, though.\n9. The replayability - only the map layout, the starting skills, the traits that you will gain during your adventure and the character interactions based on the state the adventure currently is will change the way the game plays. Everything else stays the same.\n\nThe conclusion:\nI am going to give this game a careful recommendation. The beautiful artwork, the interesting character interactions, the exploration factor and the rpg-like elements are a strong selling point to this game. I have felt a very strong connection to every single sirvivor and felt compelled to do my best to keep him/her alive throughout the adventure. Learning more about them, their past, and their agenda is extremely satisfying and keeps you either entertained, or on edge throughout the game. The game is only hindered by its mediocre main story, the replayability factor and the steep learning curve. While it can easily reel any type of gamer in, it can also irritate you the hell off and force you to shelve the game. It is up to you to decide if the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nI, personally, had a very good bit of fun with it.","September 4, 2015","true","16.5"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","37","38","0","2"

It lets you see exactly how it plays.  The game becomes more complicated and difficult past those first 5 days too.  The game is clearly pitched at the survival aspect, but the social management side is well developed and interesting as well.  I feel like I am watching the first few episodes of Lost as I play the game, solving small problems, dealing with clashing personalities and figuring out what everyone is good at.  Then of course you will eventually lose someone, probably, and you have to learn how to survive without their expertise.\n\nDon't forget to use your items, I have absolutely been saved by them.  Make sure you keep up with all the actions, maybe you will research a book which shows you how to solve your current shortcoming, or maybe you will find a location in the jungle that happens to have the very resource you need.  You can get your group in a holding pattern and stabilise, but eventually you will have a lack which forces you to move on or perish.\n\nLastly, I feel like the game is replayable.  You can work with your people a different way, or perhaps try to explore a different stretch of terrain earlier, or approach an unexpected encoutner differently.  It certainly is not infinitely repeatable, but I will certainly get a second playthrough and perhaps even a third out of this game.\n\n\nI have only encountered a single bug so far.  After a character in my camp died, they no longer showed up at the evening conversation, but the others would still refer to them as if they were still alive.  A small bug, but a little immersion breaking.\n\nEither way, I still very much recommend this game if you liked Lost or would like a slower, more relaxed survival and social puzzle.  Everything is turn based, so you can think about what you want to do.","August 27, 2015","true","7.8"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","38","42","0","0"

After a mysterious plane crash you are left with 8 survivors and must do everything in your power to stay alive. Balancing hunger, depression, injury, sickness, and more. On top of that you have social aspects such as love or people getting on each others nerves. There are things to help you through your journey of the island. Each survivor comes with a set of skills and specialties, that can be applied to multiple tasks such as crafting, hunting, gathering, exploring, researching and more. Survivors may be good at certain skills and terrible in other skills, each character is different and many elements to this are also randomized per playthrough. If you love management there is plenty to enjoy in those aspects, on the other hand if you love a mystery and story that progresses at your own pace then exploring the island is amazing fun. This is where Dead in Bermuda truly shines and where it truly immersed me in the world.  Where most games go for a super realistic tone, Dead in Bermuda doesn't mind straying into the supernatural. Aside from there are many things to enjoy here, leveling/skill system, great replay value, love interests, randomized environment, and plenty of Gilligan's Island shenanigans. The graphics are simple but have their own unique tone and flavor, there are times that I felt it reminded me of a bit of a visual novel.  One minor complaint is that moving 8 characters about by dragging them across the screen became tedious however, this is a minor complaint. In all I really enjoyed Dead in Bermuda and encourage you to explore the island...or else.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttp://youtu.be/P4l0MHNI8AY\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","27","34","5","1"

All characters have their own stats and skills what determinate what they can do better, also they earn experience points when they do task, when they earned enough, they level is expanded, after this you will get a skill points what you can spend.\n\nOne day is separated in three parts, 2 day and 1 night part. In a daily parts you can do tasks, use items, crafting, etc. At the night part you can feed your command and check out the one randomly generated dialog with some members what been a consequence of the daily task.\nAlso you should pay attention for a lot of thing to keep alive your people: hunger, fatigue, sickness, injury,depression or a water. Also the all mostly depend from all: for example for a crafting new thing like a fishing rod you should get items for this and research it. The character skills also dynamic, the healthy stats influence it too. Also you should always keep status of your things, for example feeding a fire, repair a tent etc.\n\nThe game tutorial is good enough , well explain the basic elements of game at the first days.\nThe game art style looks nice. Music and sounds good as well.\n\nSo my verdict:\n\n+random is work well (in every new game you will get different conversation, starting stats etc.)\n+good checkpoint system (you can separately go back to any day)\n+deep gameplay\n+addictive\n+challenging\n+nice art style\n+good music\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-some bugs\n-will be better with voiced characters\n\nWell this game can be one of the best in his genre. The story is enough good enough, with interesting and sometimes maybe funny conversations. The game atmosphere is great, gameplay is challenging and addictive.\nYou should choose a good strategy here and well manage your team, because if you dont do this, easily can fail. The game music and graphic style is nice, good addition to the game atmosphere.\n\nIf you like survival games, i think its can be instant buy for you and bring hours of interesting and challenging adventure, but if you are not a big fan of this genre, i think this game easily can change your thought about this.\n\n\n","March 3","true","7.5"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","2"

Before I hit the halfway mark, I was already coasting on excessive resources and bored to tears.\n\nExplanation:\n\nI wish I could leave neutral feedback, because I feel like that's what this game warrants. The first few hours of a new game are fun and challenging, but once you've gotten the abilitiy to cook your food and built the clinic the challenge drops away to almost nothing.\n\nThe mid-point of the game hits a plateau and then the last few hours of the game crash and burn in a boring downhill slog. By the time I had uncovered half of the island everyone's statuses were well under control. By the time the game was over I had over a hundred dried meals, plenty of fresh ones, and probably like four or five of those fire crystal things because I never ended up needing them again.\n\nThat's not to say the game is easy. I restarted twice while I was learning the ropes and that actually made me happy. I thought this was going to be more along the lines of "This War of Mine." Highly unforgiving with survivor deaths inevtiable and it actually being difficult to keep people alive. But once I learned the ropes it ceased to be difficult.\n\nThe only survivor that died in my winning playthrough was one that I killed intentionally because I was getting annoyed with his shenanigans (*cough*Jacob*cough*).\n\nThe translations and dialogue are really very poorly done. This game probably should've been released as a beta first because it definitely feels unpolished and unfinished. The ending was highly disappointing especially because I was really intrigued by the mystery surrounding this island.\n\nI could probably go on, but I'll refrain from listing all of my complaints here. Suffice to say that if the game gets cleaned up and rebalanced then I'll probably change my recommendation. For now, however, you're probably better off spending your money elsewhere.\n\n","September 3, 2015","false","15.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

You have to take care of they fatigue, depression, injuries and other stats. You have to last as long as possible with as many characters you can save until maybe, one day, the rescue ship comes by and picks your people out.\n\nPros:    Graphics | The first thing I noticed was the way this game looks and, damn, it looks attractive! All of the characters look great and their looks fit the way they behave. Also, there are many parts of land you can discover and each of them has a wonderful enviroment.\nComplex Character Mechanics | Each one of the characters has his own skill stats, such as scavenging, crafting, fishing and so on. Everyone even has stats for how well do they get along with everyone else. Pretty cool.\nIsland Exploration | Although the tough part of the game is taking care of and arranging characters to make sure they even live, you also get to explore the island you're on. Each turn, you can research one square of the island and find what's on it. You can make actions to this finding, such as search it for goods, disassemble it and others. When you do that, you have to pick a character. Each of them has a stealth skill. The stealthier he is, the smaller the chance is to get attacked.\nTutorial | Although the game is quite simple to understand, the tutorial comes in handy and gives you a few useful tips. This is really good if it's your first time playing.\nCheckpoints and Saving | Not only that the game autosaves, it also keeps previous saves. This means you can revert back in case you made some poor choices.\nRandomisation | Every time you start a new game, skills, items, relationships and even the island are reset. This means big replayability, which is great with survival games.\nThe Soundtrack | This game is accompanied by some great atmospheric music and it's really well-made. I couldn't find out who made the tracks, but I would love to see a Soundtrack DLC!\nSteam Integration | As you would expect, there are Trading Cards and Achievements.\nCons:    A Few Bugs | The first time I started the game, I encountered a bug that wouldn't let me start a new game. As it turns out, I was not the only one with the same problem, but the developers can't figure out what's wrong. However, this problem is solved after a couple of game resets or maybe reinstalls, so it's not a big deal.\nLack of OS Support | You would expect to see at least Linux support since SteamOS is getting more and more popular. Nuh uh. WIndows only.\nThe final verdict:Yes, yes, and yes. I'm not a big fan of survival games, but this one definitely hits the right spot. The atmosphere is great, the gameplay simple yet challenging and, last but not least, the way all of the characters behave. You have to take care of each one of them and it takes a great deal of skill and persistence to help them survive.\nIf you're a fan of survival games, this should be an insta-buy for you. If you're not, you should still consider this.\n\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Still will need to go back and unlock those three. Replay value would be up to your style of play. For me I may end up placing on the shelf after I get the three remaining achievements. But for others you may try different groups or story arcs. Story is unique and the character building is very well done. At first I felt it was going to be a Lost clone (nothing wrong with that) but the story took it to a different level A+. Character building can lead you random traits good or bad while at the camp fire talking with others. Once again control over your choices A+. They say locations are randomly placed on the island, I will find out on my second play through A+.\n\nMy only gripes were the stealth mechanics, and the scripted killings. Once you get 100% you can kind of cheese through the game and abuse locations. As for the scripted killings they can ruin a game if you are planning a perfect run. But once you learn how to control them from happening you can avoid them. But this requires playing through and having to back load from an old save to avoid it / learn from it. Two gripes and they're not really that bad.\n\nThis was a good game, a very good game. Enjoyed the time spent and money was well placed. I came across this title by watching Blitzkriegsler on YouTube. Looking foreword to seeing if this studio makes anymore games along these lines.\n\n20+ hours for a single play through.\nMoney well spent, a gem of a game.\nWill probably spend ten more hours trying to get last achievements.\n\nAs Mack would say this is WAB!\n\n","August 31, 2015","true","22.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The RPG aspect allows you to level up your survivors and shape them up to cover up their weaknesses or augment their strengths.  The survival management gives you the tough choices of whether you should feed one person over another or scavenge for supplies or get them to explore a new location possibly yielding more bounty or nothing at all.  All of this while managing the hunger, depression, injury and even relationships of all 8 of your survivors.\n\nOne of the game's few flaws is that it is fairly easy and you will probably beat it after your first or second playthrough. You will find that relationships are random and whether or not it increases or decreases when they work together is up to RNG.  Replayability is somewhat there with them being assigned different traits and locations on the island with each playthrough, however you will end up using them the same way as you did before because they all begin with the same stats as before.\n\nGiven that for 10+ hours I couldn't stop playing this game. This game receives a thumbs up.  Just don't go in thinking that this game can be played for hours upon hours on end.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rj-Pl5c9tmQ","May 8","true","19.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Steam does not offer a grey zone, but thats where this game would fit.\nSince it came out, it seems to have been re-balanced. And the "normal" mode is way to harsh and somewhat "unrealistic" or lets say "implausible". I know, its a game and such, but since its set in a half-realistic enviroment, some things really annoy me. But lets get the great things first:\n\nThe visuals are nice. The sound is charming and - thats somewhat paradox - calming. The characters are well written and differ from each other. Every single one is special. It makes a real nice first impression.\n\nBut there are so many things that will effect your gameplay in a negative way, that the game itself will become a burden. The setting is on "normal" by default. There is also an easy mode, but normal should be for normal people. But it is harsh, very harsh:\n\nEverything will wear your team down. There are nearly no positive effects during activities. The hobby fisher gets depressed while fishing, even when has the maximum success. Everything you build is extremely expensive. While 2 good people manage to get 4 units of wood, crafting a single fire place will cost you 10. Hunting equipment, which is basically a bow is above 20. The loner will be depressed when doing activities alone. The people do not seem to sleep at night, since they are never well rested in the morning. Getting fatigue down is annoyingly harsh. Exploring the map is not fun. You will know where to find what and once you used it, its gone. In the midst of the jungle is a huge tree, you can chop it down. You cannot chop down other trees. The sunny island seems to be cold as the alpines at night, since if you sleep without a burning fire, youre a goner. Putting two people that like each other on a task will still cause depression. And if the RNG fails you, they will lose their relation to each other.\n\nIf you want to survive, you have to go exactly one way. Every one of your guys is a specialist and shall be used for his specialty. Learning new stuff is rather useless. Everything will rapidly fall apart and maintaining it gets very costly. And once you hit the downward spiral, there is no way out. Food will decay rapidly. Bob will steal plenty of your food reserve and still be hungry. He even mentions that he has a secret food stack but can still die of starvation on the first try. When an encounter with an animal appears, you can hunt it and will get a good amount of food if you succeed. But you cannot send out anyone to go hunting without having the costly equipment. So before and after this encounter, no hunting. That makes no sense. You will find a place with plenty of fish, but after fishing they seem to be extinguished. Even 10 days later, you wont find any fish there. It will just be an empty square you left behind. Found a sand castle, use it once to get depression down, but never again. There is basically sand on the entire island. Its made of sand.\n\nMany values and abilities of the game are not explained good enough, so that you have to go by trial and error. Everything in this game is against you, which is not bad by default, but it limits your management down to an one-way level. And that is the point why I felt like 15 bucks was way too much for such a tiny, limited game. Even if it looks beautiful and has its charme, it does not feel like being worth its price.\n\nAnd yes, I know there is an easy mode. But I want a challenge, that can be handled. A fair challenge. A team of specialist should be able to maintain to survive for some time without dying of depression, hating each other, starving or freezing to death. There should be a balance. Bad event - depression rises. Good event, like hunting success and plenty of food - depression sinks. Sleeping at night, fatigue gone.\n\nSome last words: I wish the devs the best they can get for their future. I am sure, many good games will follow. I see that they tried to create something of beauty and value. But as a customer, I really did not feel like getting a fair game for a fair price.","January 24","false","4.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game hits the mark on many levels of design but the core elements of the gameplay are riddled with an overwhelming number of dice rolls and convoluted algorithms that ruin an otherwise simple game.\n\nDead in Bermuda hits alot of things that makes this a very visually appealing game. The parallax style that it uses in almost of it elements gives it a very unique style and overall visual approach that you don't find anymore. Compared to many other games of this genre finding a game with a moderen design is really rare.\n\nAnother high point is the dialogue between the characters. While the main story may be dry, the 8 characters each have very distinct personalities that play very well off of each other. You don't really care where this characters are going you just want to see them interact. It's more like a drama with no plot but still a more engaging than some other games.\n\nI was draw to this game for two reason. One; I love worker placement games, mostly board games, because it's hard to find this genre in video games. Two; I'm really in love with its visual design, because I'm a graphic design student. After playing the game I was met with a large amount of disappointment. One of the appeals of this genre is that RNG or dice rolls is kept to a minimum. Bead In Bermuda has so many dice rolls even a DnD player would roll their eyes.\n\nEach character  5 states that you must monitor and keep as low as possible as if one fills that character dies, and also 16 stats that detemine their effectiviness in a certain action or the ability to resist state changes or to recover from state changes. The 16 stats are pretty munch sismply to old school western style rpg design, but what's different is that each skill will raise in level as you use it. This makes no sense in this style of game as you will be so stressed for resources you will need people to what their best at not what thier worst at to skill farm, beacuse of that having skills raise in level seems pointless.\n\nBut then again performing any actions seems pointless when having a higher skill level barely raises your min. value. Yes, the first to raise is your max value, not your min. value. Exampe, the fishing action will show 0-8 as a possible outcome. Meaning it is still possible to get 0 fisth despite the fact your fishing skill is 100. Meaning for most actions raising skills ls like instead of rolling a 1d4 you get to roll 1d8 instead. Now if  you're unlucky like me then you rolled in the lower bracket pretty much everytime. It just doesn't make sense. Similarly, the relationship between the states and the stats doesn't make sense. Fatigue lowers your condition, but you need condition to lower your fatigue. There are many instances where this happens and honestly it should happen in this genre of game where you get into an uphill battle but it happens way too soon and just turns into a lockdown for any character that has too low condition. Namely this happens because as with gaining fatigue to lose the fatigue you have to roll for it. Not to mention you gain fatigue even when you sleep at night, also  determined by another dice roll. The pentalies for having high states just becomes so high that if a character gets  3 or more states to even 40% at the same time they are basicly just marked for death as they will have no way to recover from that unless you use an item, which don't appear alot.\n\nI wanted to love this game but having dice determine literally everthing makes it feel like I'm not really doing anything and that I'm losing not because of my bad choices. As for turning it to easy mode it because so easy it was basicly a just a waste of time. This game in its current state, as I have read it has changed, is basicly more like a punishment game for people that love survival games and staring RNG in the face.","March 4","false","6.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Strategy/Survival Simulator Dead in Bermuda. Dead in Bermuda was brought to us by Developer CCCP and Publisher Plug In Digital and was released on August 27, 2015.\n\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ak2E-2KZONQ\n\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nNice, easy to learn management simulator focusing on survival. Solid game.\n4/5 and worth the dough. Try the Demo for sure.\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nDead in Bermuda is a management sim, at it's heart. Tasks, time, resources, making sure the right people are doing the right things, etc. It is a full-on management simulator, with the goal being survival. 8 survivors have survived a plane crashed and are stuck together on an island. You must manage them daily, and nightly, in order to survive. Your survivors will level up as they complete tasks, allowing you to raise their stats in areas and making them better at certain things. Some people are better at some things, others are better at other things. You have to kind of fiddle around with it to maximize your efficiency. Otherwise, for example, you could be Scavenging for days and yielding little-to-no rewards. There is a learning and crafting system woven into the game, and their is also a pretty entertaining story among the survivors and the island itself that you are exploring. This game plays out MUCH better than your typical management simulator. The story is good, the interactions are great, the ar is of good quality. All in all we've got ourselves a solid, fun, challenging game here. Don't let this one pass you by, I almost did. 4/5 and worth the dough all the way.

Sounds right up my alley.\n\nSadly, a computer would do a better job at this than a human. See, with every character having stats directly linked to the tasks at hand, there is a right and wrong choice for each task.\nWhy would I set my hunting 8 girl to hunt if I have hunting 70 dude?\nIn addition, as the 'needs' increase the stats decrease... Hunger goes up by Y, Hunting goes down by X etc;\nIt just means that before assigning tasks, I'm spending a lot of time in the 'spreadsheet' to pick the highest number after modifiers. It's closer to work than to fun, but the art was nice and I was curious to see your characters develop, DiB - so I stuck with you, to find out more about your plot.\n\nOh boy.\n\nOh boy oh boy oh boy DiBbie, what the hell?\n\nSo there's a bunch of weird blue skinned people who speak in riddles and tell you about a prophecy... something your characters have a quick 2 line conversation about how that's 'a little bit weird' and on we go.\n\nI lost interest after having the silent guy send me to the nude woman on a shell who asked me to fetch a bone to refer me to the fat guy on a mound of food (that I had no option to steal while my people were starving, by the by) who insisted I brought him delicious food and eggs after that. Obtaining the giant eggs led me to blue-skinned tiger lady , where my only conversation option was 'No dude, don't kill me, look I got these wicked eggs' ...\n\nHere's where I throw up my hands, DiB; You're a spreadsheet with pretty pictures and a plot written by a stoner who just tried mushrooms.\nThere's no throught required, no strategy, and any zen-like relaxation from the pretty pictures and the character convo's is ruined by the completely unbelievable\illogical events.\n\nSorry DiB. I through you and I could work out.\nNow, I sorta regret not managing to weasel out of having started with a refund, but I tried to like you for too long.","February 12","false","10.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game has a "just one more turn" factor like Civilization. You play a group of 8 people who have crashed on a desert island. While doing the normal resource management stuff - finding food, crafting things, gathering materials - you explore the island and run into mysterious beings who mention a prophecy that can get you off the island. The goal is to find out more and fulfill this prophecy before you all starve to death, get sick, or kill each other. The encounters while you explore the island are quite amusing.\n\nThe game is really attractive with a nice, clean interface. It's not overly complex once you get the hang of it, and it does save your progress each day, so you can go back and try again if everyone dies. A big part of the game is levelling up your characters - there are 16 different skills that all impact some element of the game in some way.\n\nThere's not a ton of incentive to replay, as it seems that very little of the game is randomized aside from where exactly everything is located and a few character interactions. I had a lot of fun with it though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neviko/recommended/384310/","neviko","nevik92","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neviko/","408 products in account","Story:\nAfter an air crash on an island 8 survivors try to survive and find a way to get off the island. All characters greatly differ from each other. You have a guy who thinks to know how to survive on the island not being very likeable for the most of the people, as well as a bookworm who survived the plane crash with her father and stepmother, having a strong relationship with her father and apparently not having much normal fun in her life so far, another on is an agent who believes a spy is among the survivors and so forth.\nThe game has a unique way to convey the story. At night, before distributing the rations, a dialogue (which may influence the needs and relationships of the characters) triggers, depending on what happened the day, who worked with whom, what was discovered on the island and so on, what kind of means that you won’t have the exact same dialogues on each of your playthroughs. You get to know the characters and their relationships better. I really liked that part and it feels like the characters truly are different personalities.\n\nGameplay:\nYou have to manage the castaways on their daily life on the island. They need to collect resources, craft as well as research new buildings. But that’s not all. Considering the needs of every single survivor is much more important which are as follows: depression, injury, hunger, fatigue and sickness. Neither of these must become 100% as the character die hence. Though the game isn’t over when a character dies, it becomes just harder as there is one person less to help around the camp.\nThe characters have relationships with each other which influence the efficiency of the activities the survivor do together. So if two gather resources together and don’t like each other (relationships increase/decrease when working together) they’ll find less resources in contrast to two who like each other, having the same needed skills as the first two. Talking about skills, there are 16 skills which are diverse on each character. Some cook better, scavenge better, are better at exploring the island and et cetera. Due to that you have to think about who should do what. Should somebody with a high skill do the job, resulting in a high outcome or can you afford to place somebody less skilled there (becoming better after a while of course) so that the other one can rest for awhile or perhaps another crucial activity? All characters increase their skills by perform the corresponding job. And after a few skill increases the characters levels up and receive skill points which can be used to improve the individual skills.\n\nGraphic/aesthetic:\nEverything is beautiful drawn and the game has its’ own style, a bit cartoonish but still realistic enough to convey the characters and the environments.\n\nIf you are now interested in the game, you should give the demo a try. It’s only a few days long but I think that’s sufficient to get to know if the game is for you and the savegame can be used in the main game too. The price is very low compared to the quality by the way and the developers still listen to customers suggestions (at least when this review was written ;)).","August 31, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The beginning of the game can be a bit challenging, but the game starts to ease up once you get certain items researched.  The hidden relationships between the characters is a mechanic that is not well explained, and can have unpredictable effects on the game.  This goes beyond the simple heart ratings, and can even result in one character instantly killing another character, with no way for the player to avoid it (other than reloading a checkpoint).  The final challenge in the game is difficult if you do not have a character with the right build for it, and it seems to have a few bugs in it as of the current build (v 1.02).\n\nOther than those issues, the game is an amusing survival game, and the creators have stated that they will be adding in some new features to address some common early-game annoyances.","September 7, 2015","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though I will say the personality management aspect of the game is a bit of a rub. See, everyone has an opinion about everyone else in the group, which affects how well they work together, and this relationship goes up or down when they work together, seemingly at random. It's somewhat annoying that you can't predict/plan for people's random changes in affection for each other, which ways on group tasks even more than the characters' relevant skills do. I also wish moving around your camp felt just a little bit more responsive.\n\nThe game is fun, fairly challenging, for the style, without being overly cruel, and all in all a nice experience.","September 19, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The premise of this game is very simple - a plane has crashed, with only eight survivors and your goal is to survive and escape the mysterious island.\nEach survivors characteristics are predetermined. In other cases, lack of customization can be viewed as a flaw, but these characters are designed excellently. There is your typical big brawny Russian guy Yuri, the middle aged couple whose strengths are cooking and fishing and of course the guy who goes completely nuts and so on.\nGameplay is very straightforward. Every day is split up into three turns: sunrise, sunset and nighttime. In first two you manage resources like wood, water, food etc. by scavenging, gathering and exploring. You can also research and craft new constructions, which will help you to gather resources more efficiently. Besides various resources, you also manage survivors health like sickness and injuries, hunger, depression and more. If one of the statuses hits 100, the survivor is dead. In nighttime your survivors will have conversations, which will change their opinion about each other, increase or decrease their depression accordingly.\nThe simplicity of the gameplay can be mistaken for its low difficulty or others even say that this game is casual, but I strongly disagree. It’s not casual but rather laid back, because it’s turn based and doesn’t have any action in its classical sense. Also in my first playthrough I found it quite difficult, but on the second one, yes, it was very easy. (On replayability I will touch upon later)\nStory. By exploring you meet other people (?) who are also stranded on the island. By having conversations and doing tasks for them you unravel the mystery and by completing the last “mission” the truth is reviled and you escape the island (or do you?).\nThe story is captivating but very predictable and quite shallow and reminds me of the TV show Lost. After meeting the first two NPCs I already understood what they are and what the island is all about and the endings plot twist wasn’t “twisty” at all. But I am more of a gameplay person rather than story one (at least in these kind of games), so it really didn’t take away from my enjoyment of the game.\nAesthetic. In my opinion, the game looks sooooo pretty, because I very much like this cartoony, hand drawn look, but that’s very subjective matter. The one thing I can criticize is the music. The background music is very monotonous, you get sick of it in five minutes, and because there is no voice acting, I just listened to my music, which I do very rarely while playing a video game. I think this game could be improved a lot if the dialog would be voice acted, because it is actually very well written, it’s witty, provoking, sad and even depressing at times.\nReplayability.  This is the games biggest flaw, for me. If I like a geme, and I certainly liked this one, I want to replay it multiple times. BUT the game has very low or even no replay value. Because it is linear, there is one or very few optimal ways to complete it and there is only one ending. Usually games will have different endings depending on how many and which people will survive but this game has only one. After playing it for 14h and completing it twice, I have no desire to go back. If they add new content I will definitely play it again, but it seem not very likely because game feel very polished and complete.\nMy final verdict is that I recommend Dead In Bermuda if you like management games with superb management mechanics and don’t mind spending 15EUR on a game you will play for max 15h.\n","September 22, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very nearly good enough that it'd be worth the time to play it, but it has enough problems to be frustrating instead of fun.\n\nI've heard the old chestnut that games are good and difficult when, after failing, you can tell why you failed and what you should do differently. This game isn't like that. After failing and wiping three times all around day 25, with no real idea what I was doing wrong, Also, sometimes the game just kinda screws you over and gives characters traits that make them bad at the thing they're supposed to be good at, just because.\n\nI eventually turned the difficulty to 'easy' so I could see the story - and learned that 'easy' is 'No challange at all mode'. But that's fine. The characters are decent enough, and either likable or enjoyable to dislike. The story is adequate, with a few interesting 'ah-ha!' moments.

It was also nice that the characters have their own personalities and backgrounds, too.\n\nHowever, I'm not going back to the game any more. The story in the end wasn't very interesting and I also didn't care about the survivors' relationships with each other. The game mechanics are quite slow and I was all the time frustrated how long every turn took even if you try to fast forward everything.

You essentially have to manage a group of 8 survivors of a plane crash, tending to their needs for food, medicine, and other resources to set up and survive in a camp while trying to get away from a mysterious island, filled with references to greek god and tarot cards. While you try to keep the group alive they develop their several habilities that influence the outcome of challegnes, while also developing their relationships with each other. In normal mode the game can be punishing at times, and you certainly will see everyone die a couple of times before getting to the end. It is much facilitates on easy mode. On the bad side, the game has low replayability value (the random distribution of encounters in the island is not enough to provide a refreshing gameplay) and altrhough the characters are interesting, they coul have built up much more on the depth of their relations and the impact on the game. All in all it still is a fresh take on the survive genre and sets the idea for future games with similar mechanic.","December 31, 2015","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everyone onboard evidently dies except for the eight random people that we have left at the beginning of the game.\n\nThese eight people are our game.  We need to look over them and try and keep them alive.  The game lets us know that if any of our survivors have any single state reach 100, they will DIE!  {gulp}  These five states are Hunger, Sickness, Depression, Fatigue, and Injury.\n\nTo make things more complicated, each person has their own thoughts and traits about them that will determine how well they succeed at different tasks you might give them, and even how they get along with all of the other survivors.  Only two of each persons five traits is revealed at the beginning of the game, which should offer plenty of surprise element as you play the game!\n\nSounds complex?  Fear not!  The game is well explained in a nice tutorial at the beginning of the game, and this is what I work through in my above linked video.  It looks like the game will offer a good challenge and you better have your leadership thinking cap on when you jump into this game!\n\nI like the exploration part of the game the best so far I believe and that's where you send three of your survivors out to explore the island you've crashed on.  You'll come across different items scattered about and you must have one of your survivors take a "risk" to discover what is inside of it each time.  This is a skill check of their skills and if this check fails, a dangerous animal will pop out and attack your survivor!  It feels fresh each time and definitely keeps the game interesting!\n\nSo far, I like this game.. and will offer up a more thorough review after I complete more of the game.  For now, all I have is the gameplay video(s) I have linked above.  (When I play more of the game, I will link the new video above until I complete my first full game)\n\nI hope this review helps in some way along with the video(s) I have provided.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n-  Zaxx","August 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","11","24","3","0"

But the game is way too short. I've researched everything, built everything. Explored most of the tiles on the map. People have 100 in several skills to the point there is no challenge anymore. First time playing, I still have all survivors alive. Some challanges are there, but it's basicly a pretty easy game all-in-all.\n\nSo again, this game is waay too short! :( And it doesn't really seem to offer any replay value(I've seen some youtube videos of this). And I feel there's not more to do in there only after about 6 hours of play! But I loved it every step of the way. I didn't officially finish it, but I feel there's not more to do once all is going well, and there's no more to build or craft. So I won't be officially finishing it, I think.\n\nAlso the game has a bug/glitch if you use dual monitors(or a 2-pc-setup with KDM type software), and will force you to exit the game with alt+f4 to be able to use the mouse again. So if you drag a character with the mouse and the mouse goes out of the window it breaks the game, and the character you were dragging will be stuck to the mouse, you can still kinda set the character down, but it won't stick to any "spots" in the game.\n\nAnd sadly there's no Mac version avaliable(and they said "no" to if there's Linux/Mac or other in the works).

Their survival hinges on your ability to properly utilize their skills, monitor their mental and physical well-being, and stave off any homicidal interactions.\n\nI tend to enjoy management games and RPGs, and I was pleased to find that their marriage worked pretty well in this case. I found the management aspect to be pretty challenging at first—my first couple attempts ended with everyone dying of either hunger or sickness—but since figuring out how to survive is the point of the game, I think it was appropriately difficult and the challenge added to my overall enjoyment. I also thought that the characters were generally well done: everyone has a pretty distinct personality, and everyone’s character is revealed and developed fairly naturally using conversation around the campfire at the end of each day.\n\nI do have a couple nitpicks with the game, however. I understand that this game was translated from another language, but despite an English proofreader being listed in the credits, there are still enough errors to merit another pass at proofreading. Pretty minor stuff, admittedly—awkward phrasing, incorrect capitalization, etc.—but still not something that should be present in a complete retail product. Another issue is the limited dialogue pool. I mentioned earlier that I thought the campfire conversation was well done, but there just isn’t enough of it. I’ve played through the game twice now, and the significant overlap in dialogue events that I saw does nothing to encourage me to play through the game a third time. Finally, the mid to late game is pretty boring. (And I’m saying this post-patch 1.1, after they apparently tried to address this.) Once your survival situation has stabilized, you end up just passing the days until you’ve explored enough of the island to end the game. I actually think that this is a symptom of having made the island too large: I bet if the devs made exploration easier (so island areas were revealed more quickly) but reduced the number of helpful areas, the game would retain its difficulty in the beginning without dragging at the end.\n\nDespite my criticisms, I enjoyed figuring out how to help these people survive (sometimes despite themselves). I can see this game appealing to other casual management sim fans who don’t mind failing a few times while figuring out what to do.","January 21","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
