The other 10% is either cut off by text boxes (I have encountered only 2 or 3 instances of this), hilariously bad google translate, or localisation that doesn't quite match the rest of the game (characters using British colloquialisms, a villain saying "peace out", etc.).  None of it is particularly damning or immersion killing, and a lot of it gave me a chuckle.  So far I've been able to find answers to the untranslated quizes (such as the acupuncture point) either online or in the forum here.  I should add that I have no experience or knowledge of the chinese language.\n\nI have also not encountered any major bugs or issues.  That doesn't mean you won't, I may just be lucky in this regard.  For me, the keyboard and game are responsive with a controller plugged into my desktop and I haven't seen a single crash so far.  In fact, it runs remarkably smooth for me.\n\nNow I'm going to talk about why you should buy this game.  There are very few kung fu RPGs out there, which is a shame.  Jade Empire was decent but it suffered from Bioware's heavyhanded writing and the port was kind of a buggy mess, and I'm not familiar with any others like it.  This game is far more open and ambitious than Jade Empire, and frankly better programmed (at least than the PC port).\n\nBeyond that, it has an ambition that you don't see in RPG's anymore.  While not strictly open world, there is an openness to this game in that it allows you to make your character into whatever you want, to make friends with whoever you want, and make choices that impact your character and the world he lives in.  While there are some questionable design choices and I wish there was more information given in the UI, I absolutely appreciate the scope of this project and I think it was largely succesful.\n\nMy favorite part of the game, beyond watching my character improve from getting stomped by thugs into a respectable fighter, is how pretty and immersive it is.  The graphics are admitedly a little dated, but honestly I find that charming in an age where everything is either hyperrealistic or retro, and the hand drawn scenes are very nicely done.  The music, however, is where this game really draws you in.\n\nThis is a good game.","April 30","true","10.6"," 102 of 111 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","102","111","3","11"

Almost all event decisions affect the ending in some way.  The story branch out into about four different main storyline in late game.\n\nIt is rare to see RPG nowadays where I really took my time to consider what I should answer, or decide what I should do when there is an NPC event --- "which side should I help?" "how about just take this item by force?" "it would be the best if I do nothing and stay out of this?".  Decisions do MATTER in this game.\n\nReplay value is high.  I finished my first playthrough at around 35 hours.  So just three playthough will yield more than 100 hours, and every playthough would be very different than the those before --- all of this... just cost 15 dollars!\n\nNot to mention free DLCs with new contents and storylines (in form of mandatory updates).\n\nI recommend this game with the current price tag ($15.29).  If this game ever gets big sale (~$10 ish), you definitely need to give it a try if you are a RPG lover.","April 28","true","39.6"," 123 of 152 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","123","152","10","6"

This game is for people who have someone an understanding of chinese culture, and who love chinese history. It isn't your straight up hack and slash or diablo kind of game~ Think of it as XCOM but with rich history, there is a lot of reading involved to enjoy this game. The translations are actually well done. Chinese has never translated that well into English, so if you're expecting an English/American use of the language, you own't really get far here. If you're a chinese who grew up in the west and always wanted to learn more about chinese culture, you will LOVE this game!\n\nThis game is HUGE on character development and relationships.

It single-handely puts most modern-day RPGs to shame. Turn-based, multiple endings, multiple paths, choices and consequences, fantastic combat, wonderful music, many secrets, reasonably good story, memorable characters, you name it.\n\nThe whole theme of the game runs loosely on Jin Yong's Wuxia novels. Most of the martial skills you learn are either of Jin Yong's established skills in his novels or game dev invented or other irrelevant powerful moves known to martial arts history like the Wu Ying Jiao or Ru Lai Shen Zhang. A good refreshment over the usual Western fantasy RPGs.\n\nWhile you get to visit villages, towns and cities throughout the game, a good part of the game is spent in "learning/training" mode. In this mode, you get various choices, in the form of an artistic 2D UI, on how to build and train your character. You're given a set stamina number, which you spend either training yourself up in various skills, doing chores, gathering goods / crafting, training in the arts, or strolling around to interact with other Wulin heroes and hopefully learn a thing or two from them.\nWhen you visit towns and cities, you're presented with the usual town hubs in RPGs except of course this is in the Eastern Wuxia theme. You get to buy stuff from shops, do sidequests, collect items and help people. And this is where we come across the biggest flaw the game has to offer. Visiting certain cities and towns have time limits, and the time limits are pretty limiting. Forget about taking your own sweet time to explore the city. Just rush through the major sidequests that benefit your character most. The learning/training mode is also pretty much limited by a 4 year limit, although it's a hefty  limit to build your character, would easily last for tens of hours or more and is equivalent to numerous turns. Many events will happen in the 4 years, some minor, some major. You will, however, get to free-roam around the game world in the end of year 4.\n\nSkills and secrets are plentiful in the game. There are several martial skills for each category of weapons: sword, broadsword, staff, fist, finger, kicking, throwing weapons, music instruments, fan or brush. That's in addition to the collection of Internal Arts skills you can collect. Each skill comes with 2-3 moves and their unique bonuses. The skills are have their own animation, movesets, buffs/debuffs, and dmg stats. Needless to say the skill list is staggering, makes for multiple playthroughs to experiment, and is interesting and varied. The more powerful Jin Yong skills are in the game. Who wouldn't get excited with the mention of being able to obtain skills like "18 Dragon Subduing Palm".\nSkills come from various mentors, events or chests. In a way, some of them are secrets and the most powerful of them are quite difficult to obtain and very very easy to miss. Their power relate to your other artistic skills like calligraphy, music, or chess or to your personal combat stats. Once you miss the chance to get the skill from a person or events, it's gone for good. There's no way you can obtain the skill short of restarting the whole game or reloading an older save. That game design decision might be good for some bad for the rest.\n\nThe game has a tonne of mini-games. There are mini-games for every gathering / crafting skill in the game. While they can appear to be fun at first, they quickly become a chore. Mining requires you to popamole, literally. Fishing requires you to play tug of war with a fish that you can't possibly lose, unless you don't ever release the line. Smithing requires you to play the game "2048". Painting requires you to put a set of jigsaws in a limited time. Collecting Herbs has you playing a memory game etc etc. Sadly, some of the most powerful weapons and internal art skills require you to go through some torturous amounts of mini-game play and some of them are hard, which probably requires many reloads to get through. Unlocking chests is also a mini-game, it feels daunting at the start but it's easy once you get the trick to it.\n\nWhat makes the game truly shine other than the awesome number of skills in the game is the multiple paths you are able to walk in the game. The game has multiple endings, there are good endings, bad/evil endings, and even the grey endings. What endings you get depend on the path and choices you make throughout the 4 years of building your character and going through events. There's even an ending for losing to a chicken at the start of the game.\nThe liberty and freedom of building your character is amazing. You're free to specialise on a martial art or mix and match to your liking. Although the latter will most likely fail badly on higher difficulties.\n\nMusic is simply fantastic and adds to the game a lot. The standard Wuxia flair with a mix of Chinese, Hong Kong drama themed music. Combat is crisp, responsive and always interesting. Character art potraits are full of character and are eye-popping to look at. Story is decent enough and there are multiple paths to walk which will definitely affect your story. This game is already a great classic, imo. If they removed the town/city time limit and put less emphasis on the mini-games, optimise it a little, it'll become even better.","May 19","true","127.5"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","33","35","2","0"

Well, the game is amazing. I'm only a little way into it but I can tell it is going to be ridiculously massive. Every skill seems to unlock something else - new characters turn up or I get a new ability or martial art or can make better stuff or whatever. Okay, yeah, that's how most games with a skill system work, but given that my character ended up drinking cheap wine till he gained the power of Drunken Kung Fu from a magical hobo I think it's safe to say that the skills you get are really unexpected and seriously fun. I wouldn't be surprised if you managed to master flower arranging and ended up being able to decapitate a man by pelting him with a handful of rose petals. The sheer amount of stuff available might be a bit intimidating to some people, but a good tip is just to grind hunting because then at the end of the day you can (I never thought I'd ever type this) go home and eat a big bag of tiger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for massive stat boosts.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice - the 'control your guy and run around doing Kung Fu' sections aren't super ultra realistic high-def but it's still all nicely detailed and looks good. That and the music combines perfectly to really set up the atmosphere.\n\nThe combat sections aren't too bad either. It all plays out fairly well, there are (as far as I've seen anyway) no giant drawn out combats or sections where you can tell the dev's were making something else and didn't have time to really perfect this combat or that fight. I will say that early on some people might think otherwise (There are some brutally hard fights) but early on in the game don't forget you are playing an ordinary guy just starting out in the Kung Fu superhero business.\n\nNow, onto the flaws. There have been a few people complaining about a bug where not being in fullscreen makes the keyboard stop responding, but I've never seen that or had the game crash so I can't comment. The translation is the only thing close to a complaint I have, and given how the game was actually translated I suppose I can't be too harsh. The developers basically open sourced it and got the fans of the series to help them out, so yeah, there are going to be sections where it is perfectly translated into The Queen's English and sections where urteh baonfo legging, though thankfully there's more of the former than the latter. Thanks to the size difference between English and Chinese text though, there are quite a few sections where the text overflows from a page and you can't read it all and where font sizes change from section to section so everything can fit in. If they keep working on the translation then yeah, this'll go from being really good to genuinely epic.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Oh hell yes I do. Was I kidding about the Tiger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? no. That is an actual thing.","April 29","true","29.0"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","38","48","7","0"

It's an update of a previous game and the first I'm aware of to make it into English.\n\nWhat is it? One part is top down RPG, running around, talking to people, doing quests, buying stuff, whatever. Combat is handled in unique turn based RPG style where the accumulated effort of the sim portion determines your characters internal style, martial arts styles and stats.\n\nThe sim segments involve you making meaningful and vital decisions in growing your character, do you explore the town and encounter new and strange allies/enemies and possibly even learn new martial arts? Or do you try to master Music, which will learn you powerful techniques in combat?\n\nThere's a ton of different skills and minigames involved in raising your tea sipping alchohol drinking kungfu master, many of them interesting, a few sure to be a little frustrating.\n\nMost interestingly, the game is actually pretty in depth with teaching the player a lot of fascinating stuff.\n\nThe bad is clear, the game has some technical hiccups which, if you're not comfortable browsing the forum to solve, can prevent you from playing. In my experience, once I figured out how to get the keyboard to work in game I encounter no technical issues as of my near thirty hours in game.\n\nThe second is the translation, it begins pretty strong and carries through on the main story comprehnesibly but some paths of various events are translated bizarrely and inconsistantly. If you can appreciate a bad dub, this is more charming than problematic but some segments are simply not translated at all. I'd put the translation at about 99.9% complete, but that .1% does pop up and will irritate some less forgiving.\n\nUltimately, I love this game. It's full of content, I'm not even done my first playthrough but already I'm looking forward to playing through as a villain, a womanizer, and so on. My first character has dozens of martial arts I haven't even begun to use, not to mention internal styles and so on.\n\nThis game really makes you feel like you're raising a badass martial-artist, and presents a full and fascinating Wuxia fantasy world for you to get lost in.

Name input is of course Surname/Name but there is no direct indication of this and the formatting is kinda weird for name display afterwards (it combines the name into a compound name on the character display it seems)\n\nIn-combat speech and character bios do not scroll and are limited by being on a single page so dialogue and text are cut off.  This is the biggest negative for me and really should have not been released with this one way or another.\n\nIn-game time is a bit difficult to get the hang of since it is given to you in the format of of [Hour of <Chinese Character Name>]\n\nThere is a section early on in the sim portion that wants you to ID an acupuncture point based on a picture, but the picture itself is not translated to English so it ends up being a save/load thing.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe dialogue, while obviously not professionally translated, is still pretty easy to comprehend.  The sim elements are pretty fun, sorta like a Long Live the Queen-Lite.  The story itself seems really fun, too.  I am not far into it but it has gripped me so far.\n\nThe combat is adequate but I have not had much of a taste of it yet.  It doesn't seem like it'll be difficult to grasp for people not familiar with the SRPG genre\n\nIt may seem like there is a lot more bad than good, but the good portions really do outweight the nagging translation issues.  Perhaps they will release a patch to fix them, but even if they don't it is playable + fun if you are looking for basically a more interactive CYOA\n\n\n\nEdit: Going to add a few more things:  There are some untranslated lines. I don't know if it is incidental dialogue or what, but the initial lines of the Pharmacist and the patients in the Luoyang pharmacy are untranslated.  I assume they are unimportant because there was no red highlted text.  There are a few tea patrons scattered about with what I assume is also chatter dialogue that is untranslated as well.\n\nThe grammar randomly takes a dive with some lines, but from what I understand the translation was crowdsourced or something similar so it is to be expected that the quality isn't uniform.  It can take you out of the story a slight bit though.\n\nOverall would still recommend it. I am enjoying it still even though I am pretty sure I chumped my character by not focusing skills enough!!","April 28","true","20.9"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","4"

The acupuncture diagram is untranslated, so good luck savescumming the medicine questline. The times are given in chinese instead of just using numbers. In one town there is a quest where you are asked to say how a certain chinese character sounds. Instead of replacing the quest with something appropriate the game just gives the answer to each question and calls it a day.\nThe ugly: the game is buggy and crash prone. Ocasionally the keyboard stops working, at which point you have to quit and load the last save.\n\nOverall I'm enjoying the game, but my enjoyment is greatly reduced by the technical problems and poor translation.","May 1","false","45.4"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

However, once I got past the beginning and a bit into the game it became a lot more stable, and I have yet to experience a crash like I was having in the beginning.\n\nTale of Wuxia is a great RPG featuring deep strategical combat, a compelling story, and a great albeit at times very repetitive soundtrack.\n\nThe combat has a turn-based, hex-grid strategy system. Based on your various stats you may move a certain amount of hexes. If you strike from in-front of your enemy, they have a much higher chance of countering you. As such your character positioning is very important. Some characters have special effects, such as one of the characters you start with, whose ability is to defend characters he is within one hex of when they get attacked. The combat can get a bit complicated--even though I am only playing on the easiest difficulty, I am having quite some trouble with some of the battles.\n\nAnother part of the game you're going to be seeing a lot is perhaps the part of the game I like the least. After the first part of the game, you join a martial arts sect and spend a lot of your time training there. Over time you get access to various activities you may participate in. These include doing chores, training your basics, your internals, your skills, producing wares, and going for a stroll. All of these require stamina, and the only way to recover stamina, is to rest, which after a certain amount of times will progress the story.\n\nA couple of hours into the game, I feel incredibly underpowered, with my main character only surviving one or two blows by an enemy, whereas my supporting characters are a lot more powerful. I know I am supposed to be weaker than them, however I can't help but feel like I did something wrong in training my character.\n\nAside from those issues, I am truly in love with the game. I am not a huge rpg-fan, nor am I  a huge-wuxia fan, yet the game in-spite of some lack of polish is great. Try it out, and if you don't like it, or if it keeps crashing for you; refund it.","May 21","true","6.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","17","23","6","0"

Try as they might to translate, some of the words are just nouns. i.e. "YaMen" the closest to that word would be court/prison.\n\nStill if you're trying to play a real kungfu game, this is the best you can find (translated to english).

Gameplay overall is great and fun, rasing sims is definely a plus, storyline is not half bad at all. Several funny plots really made me laugh.\n优点：新鲜感的武侠游戏。可能是因为我好几年没玩过武侠游戏，但无论如何这款侠客风云传玩起来还是挺带感的。整体游戏性不错，养成元素肯定是亮点，故事也挺好。还有不少搞笑的对话。\n\n\nCons: Bugs, poor optimizations, some of the stupid game mechanism.\nFor example, one bug occured after I unlocked main map, the main map is just plain yellow, cant do nothing.\nPoor optimizations: my laptop is i7 3630m + gtx 660m, old but decent. Anyone could figure for this kind of game with super low quality visual, my laptop should handle it pretty okay, but no, laggy sometimes. Also, when you walking in the any 3D scene, you OFTEN get stuck, not able to move, even tho it looks like you are on the road.\nGame mechanism: Why the fk you can only rotate your camera in battle?! I understand you want to make chests harder to be found, but is this the best effort you can do, not allowing camera rotation?? Also in a battle, you cant see your characters far away from your current controlled character, which means you cant control the others in far distance unless you finish your current character's turn.（Comment below told me, I can switch between characters with tab） Oh, not mention, the game doesnt really have much keyboard support, like the basic characters movements. Or no camera movements, only camera rotations...\n缺点：bugs，糟糕的优化，一些脑残的游戏设定。\n比如有个bug发生在我解锁大地图之后，整个大地图是一坨黄色，什么都干不了，我后来只能读之前的档重玩。\n优化：我笔记本是i7 3630m + gtx 660m虽然比较老，但任何懂的人都应该看得出像这样一款游戏，我的笔记本照理应该是跑的毫无压力地。但事实上，还是时不时有卡顿和掉帧。还有，在任何3D场景（非战斗）中移动，都会随时卡住，走不了。得不停尝试不同方向。\n游戏机制：他妈的为什么只能在战斗中转换视角？我明白你想让宝箱找起来难一点，但明显有很多其他方法，为什么要选择不能转视角？！另外在战斗中，如果有角色在离你控制的人物非常远的地方，你可能就看不见，换句话说就是你不能选到那个角色。（评论告诉我可以用tab切换，所以这个就不算给问题吧）你必须先结束当前角色的回合。对了，这游戏还不怎么待见键盘，连最基本的角色移动都不能用键盘。另外没有视角移动，只有视角转动。。。卧槽\n\n\nOverall: I would still recommand this even tho there are lots of technical problems. I can see most of the problems come from the fact that they are using an engine(Unity3D) that is focusing on mobile gaming and I am almost certain that their programmmers are at least not doing their best job( Because I am a programmer myself).\n总体：我仍然选择推荐这款游戏，即使这游戏有不少技术上的缺陷。很明显大多数的问题都来自于他们使用了一款手游游戏引擎（Unity3D），以及很明显他们的程序员并没有全力制作这款游戏。","May 11","true","118.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

It expects you to explore and fail\n+ I'm just at the surface of all the features of the game (after 20 hours)\n+ For wuxia lovers, a definite try (especially since it's in English)\n+ Many amusing/annoying minigames to simulate mining, smithing, herb gathering etc (the treasure chest puzzle with 4 colours and 20 moves?  insane)\n+ The only game so far I know where every NPC has a name or a unique title, and between them they never say the same things.  Sometimes, talking to an NPC will trigger a quest or even a small minigame (usually a riddle)\n+ The translation is quite acceptable (if you are a reader of wuxia light novels translated to english, it feels similar).  Humourous at times, poetic at others.\n\nCons:\n+ I hate the music, or it's just me.  If they took the soundtrack from Prince of Qin it would be so much better.  (FHXY : PLEASE TAKE NOTE!!!!!)\n+ You really need to know a lot about wuxia (internal arts, battle style, meridian systems, chinese poetry etc) to make heads or tails of it.  I can guess it will be very difficult for people who has little knowledge or appreciation of wuxia.\n+ Potential to really screw up your character build if you have no idea what you are doing.  Too many stats (though it will be explained to you slowly over the course of 10 to 20 hours of gameplay)\n+ Translation bugs (a few npc did not have complete translation.  So unless you can read chinese, either get someone who can to help you, or just spray and pray).  As mentioned by some other reviewers, some description for people/items are not complete as it got cut off. (if some items can have its font minimized to fit into the description box, why not others.  Don't be lazy, developers)\n\nAdvice for players\n+ Google is your friend (barely)\n+ The meridian system translation will be found in your character sheet - books - medicine.  Then take a picture of each meridian point (cheat...lol).  you will ace every medicine task (crucial to access pellet making ie potion making.  Pellets and potions are very expensive at game start, and few and far.  Some pellets/potions provide permanent boosts to your attribute, so swig em.)\n+ Many of the poetry and sayings mentioned are directly translated from Mandarin (that's why it sounds so exotic/ridiculous depending on your POV)....pay attention when they are bolded or different colour (usually an indication a minigame or riddle will come up)\n+ you will start really really weak, compared to other games where you start able to hack and kill normal mobs.  IF you cannot win, try to keep your (personal) character from dying.  Use the experts that the game usually include for you to weaken or kill the enemies.  In due course, you will grow.  The game letting you use other experts with other weapons and internal styles is to give you a picture of what your character can potentially learn and become (yes, there is a son goku style kamehameha move somewhere in there)\n+ don't bother to master all the production /crafting skills - personally i went with mining/smithing/medicine/music.  You won't have time to max them at the start (im not sure about end game...barely there)\n+ the more internal skills you obtain and upgrade (even if you don't equip them) the higher your hp and energy will go\n+ a lot of the food/tea/wine/consumable stuff provides permanent boosts to hp and energy.  if you have the cash, buy em and eat.  No point to store em.\n+ Sometimes the game will proceed when you haven't finish a particular quest.  Deal with it, it's mostly gone.\n+ I had 2 crashes.  Once when fiddling with the graphics setting, another when during gameplay.  I cannot comment on the persistent crashes other people are facing, and have no idea.  Try to play on lowest graphical setting\n+ talk to everyone and everything.  You never know.  Explore each and every map.  It's not that big.  Buildings can be entered, you will notice a faint golden glow at the entrance, or the doors will open up.\n+ safe the game before opening any treasure chest (until you can recognize which one does not require a puzzle to be solved, and which one does) treasure chest keys are not easily obtainable\n+ some minigames (for crafting/production)  will frustrate you to the max.  Take it easy.\n\nWith the lack of quality wuxia genre games in Steam and most importantly in English, this game however is quite a rough gem.  Certain facets of it is brilliant, while other parts are rough and coarse.  It is hoped the developers or publishers of this game take this into account and do something to polish up the rough and coarse parts.  There has never been a quality wuxia genre game in English (AFAIK, prince of qin nearly 15 years ago pretty good, but not great), and wuxia mmo has been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ since day one.  Hopefully with Tale of Wuxia (and official patches and upgrades) a new genre will enter the gaming sphere.","May 5","true","20.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","11","18","4","0"

This one is a classic to behold & embrace.\n-Multiple story lines and endings giving it more replayability.\n\nCons:\n-Frustrating random glitches.\n-Cut scenes can't be skipped.\n-Can't save during battles.\n-Some Terrains & objects getting your character stuck while exploring towns & big map.\n-Random freezes during various battles, some end battles can't be un-frozen by switching between desktop and the game.\n-No rewards given for playing higher difficulties and completing the game.\n-Gauntlets for Fist fighting styles are bugged and have zero effects on the stats.\n-Weapons have very minimal impacts on your damage/defence.\n-Forging the strongest weapons are extremely difficult but since they don't make much difference it's un-rewarding.\n-Some of the most powerful techniques are actually weak in this game, making it unsatisfactory to train.\n-The battle UI limits to one style, with the more powerful styles of each technique on long CD, greatly reduced the freedom during battles. Even though you can hot-swap techniques this makes it pointless to do so due to the long CD.\n-All final battles are very unbalanced. Boss-class enemies deal massive damage.\n-Unbalanced enemy buffs especially evasion + combo can go on forever until you die.\n-Each story line and ending requires a certain events to be triggered and those events are way too random. In most cases you will be stuck with the exact same story line on every replay unless you get lucky or spend hours save/load all day. And there are no hints to direct you.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, still a fun game. If you like single-player games with strong stories that involve the Chinese Wuxia background, you will love this game. This is a dying breed that's being destroyed by the online gaming trend. The fact that Herou and the devs are still willing to create a game like this is really appreciative and players should still support them nevertheless. Their efforts should be respected and appreciated. Despite the bugs/glitches, I still give it 8/10. It's a great game in its own right.","May 12","true","275.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

But i actually kinda dislike the way you acquire new skills and the training system. The first game was epic where you can grind for days and nights just to get all your stats to max and skill lvl max out, in this version, you are only given 4 short years to try to acquire new skills via the relationship system and then the game sets you off to the final part whether or not you like it.\n\nPros :\nLots of things to be done like crafting, working, lvling skills, improving stats, romancing etc\nNostalgic BGM from popular Jin Yong dramas.\nCute character portraits\nBattle system that reminded me of the good old time when I was playing Episode one in the 90s.\n\nCons\nVery limited time frame.\nGame restricts what you wish to do by rushing you to the end game after 4 years.\n\nAfter defeating last boss its the end. Theres no way to continue the game from after the final battle.\n\nLimited areas for exploration\n\nAs a single player RPG lover, I want to grind my stats, and i really mean GRIND...sleepless nights that kinda grind and not limited time kinda grind.\n\nIf the background story is a continuation from the game in the 90s, at least give this new episode the ability for players to explore more of the world map for more random encounters.\n\nUncompleted translations, I know they are working on it but for those of you who doesn't understand Mandarin i would suggest you to wait till translations are done. And even so, please do expect bad translations here and there like what we have now.\n\nFor me, I don't feel it's worth $17 for such a rushed game with limited content. On the bright side, they are working on translations for the DLCs that are soon to be released\n\nRatings wise I'd give a 5/10.

Lots of different martial arts and inner arts to cultivate, many of which only are stumbled upon by chance or as a reward for something. You decisions in the game actually matter and leave a lasting impact on the game from then on out. The mini games for collecting resources are kinda silly but are quite fun. The combat is a fairly straight forward hexagonal turn-based strategy with a few tweaks added in. But even so, there is enough depth to keep each new combat fresh and interesting. However, before purchasing this game, be aware that progression is rather slow and can at times feal a bit grindy. This is because you actually train your characters aspects one by one with minimal stamina for any actions each day. You can go through the days fairly quickly but often times events or conversations will add to this time spent cultivating. However, it is possible that through adventuring (taking a stroll) that you can stumble upon a great chance for sudden increses in stats or new arts.\nLong story short, Its a wuxia novel in game form where you control the story. If you like that sort of thing then this is the game for you. If not, you can still enjoy it but i doubt you'll last through a full life...unless you die really early on which is very possible.","June 6","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Imagine that!\n\nWhat I'd like to see to really make this game successful:\n- Consistent translations! This really is a key factor. Right now it feels like three or four people translated the game, with a quality anywhere between good and high school ESL. Get an editor who speaks both Mandarin and English and it'll do wonders.\n- A quest log and ideally an area map, so you know what you're doing and where the hell you're going.\n- Weapon icons.

The music is beautiful and fits the setting well. The graphics are somewhat lacking but I would say add a bit of charm to this game. You play in two differnt modes. One is a psuedo free roam withing a city while the other is a Simulation Style grind where you build up your character. It has nice balance and is easily a game you get swept up in. Expect to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you for a bit as you start off weak and begin to grow as time goes on. The mini games are fun but take a while to get the hang of. I have noticed that the game isnt 100% translated and certain things are still in Mandarin. I have experianced a few bugs that cause some heart ache but nothing I could not work around really. The inventory screen could use some rework as it is difficult to find certain items at time. All in all I reccomend this game while it is one sale.

The games format is largely closer to visual novels interspliced with more in-depth open world sections in between, the full open world does not come about until much later into the game.\n\nHowever, the game is alright if you are a fan of the series and it is a thrill to have this on Steam, all fingers crossed that we get the first game, 金庸群侠传 (Heroes of Jin Yong), translated and onto Steam.\n\nPros:\n1. Large amounts of branching paths which lead to different skills and items.\n2. Fallout-eqse multiple endings depending on game achievements ie...somehow marrying nearly a dozen women.\n3. Its a sequel to 金庸群侠传 (Heroes of Jin Yong) which gives alot of nostalgia points.\n4. Great art\n\nCons:\n1. Translations are not fully complete and there are errors and inconsistencies riddled throughout what is already translated which may cause difficulty to non-speakers of the language.\n2. Requires a dearth of colloqial knowledge of the world to complete mini-quests throughout the game which is not readily available to casual players.\n3. Occasional cutscene bugs which causes certain events to stall out only to resolve themselves later in the game.\n4.

In fact, I'm not sure if there is a menu.\n- The art styles clash - most of it is in traditional Chinese art styles, but then there are random anime popups.
