To the point where the Starship novastrike unity launcher form their Itch.io deployment of the game had hovering helideath blatantly staring at you on the launcher.\n\nBland, ultra generic, and the only abundace you will find here is the quantity of boredom to be obtained from Mini Attack Submarine or ANY of the offerings from Digital Homicide. Save yourself. Don't buy these games.\n\nSee what I mean here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t__HuQYLglQ","May 27","false","1.1"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","42","44","2","0"

I ran through four "levels" and saw at most two dozen creatures, and died exactly once by skimming the bottom.\n\nStarship: Nova Strike at least required that I do something other than hold the down-arrow key.\n\nProject-flipping at its finest. Mini-Attack sub is the earliest of the three games that are on this particular template: Starship: Nova Strike was the last, released on Steam some weeks ago. The middle child is Hovering Heli death, which is still on Greenlight, and currently resides in the top 100 games.\n\nSave your money.","May 28","false","0.1"," 31 of 31 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","31","31","2","0"

I'm not even sure what to call "This"\n\nMini Attack Submarine, where to f*cking begin? I feel like the reason this game was called MINI attack submarine was because the devs couldn't be bothered to scale all the monsters to be the correct size to the actual submarine so they decided to take a shortcut and just scale down the sub and call the game MINI attack submarine.\n\nEverything looks dull and not good to look at, it's probably their drabbest looking game yet.\n\nYou can also easily go through the world by simply hitting revers when the game starts up aswell.\n\nI feel like when Digital Homicide make a new game, before they put it on Greenlight, before they put it on Steam, they need to ask themselves, "Is this a game I would play for a lot of hours, i this a game packe dwith tons of fun and good material?" MAS fails to fill up any of these categories.\n\nOne mind f*ck that's in the game is the background, the background, and the scenery itself, is 3D and you frequently move around this 3D environment but it has the models of the sub and enemy fish going at a 2D point. This actually made me get a bit of a headache when I was playing it.\n\nThe problem is with MAS is that it's giving me barely anything to work with. That's also why this review is short.\n\nPros\n+ It's different from what they've done previously... no, I can't use tht cus of Starship Nova Strike....it's simple?\n\nCons\n- Boring\n- Dull graphics\n- Terrible use of both 2D and 3D\n- Bugs\n- Can give you a headache\n\nFinal verdict: 2/10\n\nMy curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 27","false","0.3"," 49 of 75 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","49","75","9","4"
