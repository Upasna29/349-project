"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/238070/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Meet Shadow Warrior, the overlooked FPS game from creators of Duke Nukem 3D, Asian style. Just like Duke Nukem 3D, player will find themselves exploring the "real" levels, that are filled with ancient chinese secrets, as you are mowing down mutant ninjas with explosive weapons and interacting with level themselves.\n\nSure thing since this is old game, you probably want to know how this release works... Well, this one is the original FULL registered version (No expansion packs included), provided for free for your enjoyment, as it was back then. Even meaning that it still adverisates you to go and have some dojo multiplayer fun at Ten website (Which sure is non-fuctional now and just contains the history of the project). From what I heard, this one went free after some hacker managed to leak/abuse keys that were being given away on Twitter in one way or another... So you should enjoy a F2P game that doesn't have hats and microtransactions.\nThe second Expansion Pack (Wanton Destruction) is also available for free, just not on Steam, so you will have to do some stuff with your own hands.\n\nSure thing since it's a DOS game, developers had to do something about it. Developers went in a simple way - use DosBox. It uses the latest 1.74 version of DosBox, thankfully, and the CD music is still there, so there are no problems there. The launcher allows you to choose whetever you want to go and configure game (Launching Setup in DosBox) or launch game itself.\nYour average player will not be able to play multiplayer in this one, as it isn't really supported (no configurations for that for average Steam player) and that it will require some serapate configurations of DosBox, so I didn't try this one. I would recommend you running one of modern source port if you want that that (Or even Shadow Warrior Redux once it gets multiplayer, some day). Another thing, is that controls are already configred by default to fit modern WASD configuration, as well as use mouse for mouselook, with only having to press square brackets buttons to choose items being uncomfortable.\nAnd yes, it's a Software version of the game, not 3DFX one.\n\nNow, game itself. In short, it's Duke Nukem 3D with style of the East. Heh, the only thing it's lacking are rainbowly colored human ninjas, like in Western movies... But randomly colored mutant ninjas will do. Shadow Warrior provides the players with two episodes. Shareware 4-level episode and Registered episode made for full version. And let me say this: When I played Shareware episode, I was amazed by level design. It was big, varied, had something interesting going on, as you travel city to the village in the forest. Worth playing for that. Now, the Registered episode felt like a let-down after that. The levels were just much less interesting, more of generic. I played only half of it, in all honesty, but from what I seen you spend first half of episode travelling through ancient Asian temples and villages, wihle only the second half lets you out to more interesting city levels.\nAnother thing to note, it the humor of the game... The main character is Lo Wang, the old bald Asian pervert with love for personal, automated and nuclear weapons. With his tongue-in-cheek comments, I found myself often chuckling during playthrough. It also inludes some more of offensive things, that puppies nowadays can't handle which is why we got none in new Shadow Warrior reboot game. Be ready to meet some out-of-place anime girls. Fun easter eggs and the ever wise Fortune Cookies included.\nWeapons are varied as well... Well, there are some more or less underpowered ones, but you will find use to most of them. Some have few modes. One of more interesting things would be a Grenade Launcher... It has same blast power as the rocket launcher, but the radius of explosion is simply huge. As a result, you will use it often to lob grenades around corners into rooms you suspect an enemy to be in, instead of using it for direct combat. Sticky bombs that are abe to stick to walls, as well as bodies. ("Oho, sticky bomb likey you!"). (Strangely enough, Railgun shoots a bit to the left of crosshair.)\n\nGraphics are of high-quality pixel art, and levels have a lot of details, usually, utilizing the latest improvements of Build engines. Prepare to see some floor-over-floor, reflections and other nice features, if you are familiar with previous Build games. As for music, it mostly plays a role of ambient, being CD quiality. mostly just enchanting the atmosphere of the game. But no worries, Boss and Title music are kicking and rocking.\n\nAnd final note, the game is insanely hard. It's even more hard than Duke Nukem 3D, mostly in cheap ways. It either pits you againts monster with hitscan weapon (some of them even able to take cover) or it casually makes you face the enemies that can insta-blow-up your face off the Earth. Traps are no less nasty. As a result, I would highly recommend you to play the game on the lowest difficulty settings, like Tiny Grasshopers, if you wish to have some fun, without having to quickload OFTEN. Not that you still will not be blown off the face of Earth, mind that.\n\nP.S. http://www.3drealms.com/sw/  This link will provide you with anything you need, including some Lo Wang rap.","February 14, 2014","true","11.3"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","60","65","0","1"

Everyone should make it in 15-20 without previous experience. Lurking around after having killed all the enemies for a missing key is not fun at all.\n\nJust started the 3rd mission and i give it a fair 8/10.

It shares many similarities to Duke3D, though it plays completely different. Rather than carefully balancing ammo like in Duke, this game tries the opposite and makes health extremely scarce, but gives you a ton of super powerful weapons with huge amounts of ammo. To put it in perspective my most used gun in this game is the rocket launcher rather than the shotgun like most old games. Be sure to save often if you play this as being killed with 100 health is not terribly uncommon. The game in general is significantly more difficult than Duke as well (except Duke episode 4).\n\nMP is also pretty entertaining, or at least was back in the day.

It was effectively the successor to Duke Nukem 3D. While Duke Nukem 3D made fun of American action movies, Shadow Warrior was a parody on Kung Fu movies.\n\nThe game stars Lo Wang, a man who continuously makes puns about how his name is slang for ♥♥♥♥♥. Who's mentor is killed by his arch nemesis, which prompts Lo Wang to go on a roaring rampage of revenge across a fairly lengthy campaign.\n\nThe thing with Shadow Warrior I tend to dislike is more it's reliance on enemies with hitscan weapons. The most common footsoldier in the game is your basic ninja with an uzi, and he drains your health pretty quickly win an undodgeable barrage of bullets. In contrast the basic trooper in Duke Nukem 3D fired a slow moving projectile you could dodge. I actually never finished this game entirely because of how unforgiving it was.\n\nAdd to that it's stylistic influence was a bit campy and in general the game wasn't as well polished as Duke 3D was. It ran on the same engine though and had a source port so that's a plus.\n\nOne thing to note about the Steam release is it runs on Dosbox, so unlike the Duke Nukem 3D Megaton edition it will not run in your native resolution or anything. So I'd suggest seeking out a sourceport which there are a good amount of for this game.","May 29, 2013","true","0.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

CalhOUn","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198131446547/","29 products in account","It's a challenging game, even on medium difficulty. The main character, Lo Wang, is definitely fun to play as, always making cheesy, 90s one liners like Duke Nukem. Such "clever" one-liners include, "I am walking into walls now," or, "Oh: you are falling apart.” The weapons have nice variety, ranging from the conventional Uzi to the ridiculous decapitated head of a Demon Guardian that shoots freaking fireballs, and even... a heart. The exploration is excellent, with many secret rooms, optional backtracking (for finding more ammo, health, armor and even enemies), and destroyable set pieces that may lead to unlocking cool weapons such as the Rail Gun, if said set-piece is kept intact. Ammunition and armor are not as plentiful as you may think, and most weapons eat up ammunition quickly. This makes the player think of strategies to use instead of simply running around, guns blazing. The puzzles, while not the hardest, certainly provoke thought. That's what I love about this game: like its 90s FPS brethren, it's a smart FPS that definitely deserves to be checked out. There is little to no plot however, with the set-up giving you an excuse to kill enemies and make it to the end of the level. Though this is to be expected with an old shooter. Otherwise, I am unable to think of any more negatives. The best part: it's for free!","July 12, 2014","true","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Whilst enemy design is generic it's still better than guy with gun and guy with a different gun, and speaking of the guns, it has insanely cool design (see the Riot Gun: nuff said), with weapons switching types, up to three in some cases, and the game gets straight to battling the demons of hell, which is what 90s shooters are all about.

Actually, I think the reputation of Shadow Warrior's racism is a little overstated, but it's still an incredibly tasteless FPS. That doesn't mean it's a bad game! Shadow Warrior represents the technical pinnacle of 2.5D engines and the level design shows this. From driveable vehicles to water currents to puzzles where you move parts of the level, Shadow Warrior has very creative and varied levels. Be warned, though: this also seems to be the pinnacle of 2.5D difficulty. The enemies here are far harder than the ones in Doom or Duke Nukem 3D. Even the "grunt" enemy can very quickly kill you if you aren't fast on the draw. But if you can put up with the high difficulty and the incredibly non-PC "humour" (including but not limited to Hiroshima jokes, bad accents, and reproducing rabbits), there's a lot to like about Shadow Warrior. And it's free!","June 3, 2013","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Back then, it was a fantastic FPS and it still is today. Between the humor, the guns, and length, Shadow Warrior gave you real value for your money. While this version does run using DOSBox, the files can work with source ports. However, there are other issues. Along with laggy performance, there are also terribly bound controls and a lack of additional content. Plus, this release is eclipsed by Shadow Warrior Classic Redux, a $10 package which comes with OpenGL rendered versions of Shadow Warrior and its two expansion packs, along with a level editor and the original DOS version. Note that Redux gets rid of all of the above issues with the free version.\n\nBottom line is this: Having Shadow Warrior for free is great. But if you have the money, go with the Redux version. The free version is alright, but it suffers from bad performance (even on good machines), awful controls, and lack of content in comparison. The free version isn't bad, but it's a bit obsolete.","March 25, 2015","false","1.1"," 22 of 90 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","22","90","0","0"

"Oh, it's a... wait, it's a... it's a car! And it has an alarm! Wow!". You can feel designers were inspired by the freedom and limits of the 3D in 1996, building a world like a child would out of lego-like constructor, and Shadow Warrior shows a good example of this pixelated creativity. Crazy weapons, crazy enemies, crazy levels - it was all new back then, and you can feel it. Today's games, made after so much was done, just can't have that feel of novelty and inspiration. Now that it's free, it's something to definitely play once - even if just to get a glimpse of 3D games history. Shadow Warrior is not the best of Build engine games, but it's definitely got some memorable moments.","January 27, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The engine is far more sophisticated than even Blood, and dwarfs what was possible in Duke 3D. While I don't have a large amount of time on this computer, I have played Shadow Warrior extensively. It has that classic pc presentation, so graphics are excellent, if not for the low resolution. The only problem I have with the game is the crushing difficulty, often times getting obliterated in moments after my last quick load, and needless to say can lead to immense frustration. It's a real shame, because when the gore is flying, the guns are blazing, and you're strafing and jumping non-stop; the game is a superlative example of Old-School FPS. However, even so I feel Blood and Duke did the difficulty better, it really is a crushing game. But all problems I have with the game can be wiped away with one simple sweep: it's free. So of course I recommend playing it, it's not going to waste your hard drive space, your wallet isn't any lighter, and you can find out how you feel personally about the game.

Know the bad first of the game has some problems first of no fullscreen option in the options (thought it launches at fullscreen)   , second  the game crashes for no apparent reason at some points. know maybe is because of my os (windows 8) and third but not least was whit all the hentai reference in the game if i want   hentai i watch hentai not play ah classic fps but thats mainly me so yeah this game is awesome and i highly recomend it","May 19, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know people will be drawing comparisons of this and duke nukem. Although the graphics are similar, this is SO much better.\nTake the gore for example. One swipe from your sword and the enemy is sliced in half! And of course, this is a classic fps. Which means proper levels (not a linear path), lots of blood, secrets dotted around everywhere, intense action, humour, and more. In any case, it's FREE!

Experience one of the great shooters from the late 3D Realms, creators of Duke Nukem. This game is for anyone who wants silly over the top jokes and balls to the wall action. You play as Lo Wang (yes that's his name) on a journey to seek revenge on those who killed his master, who just so happened to have unleashed an angry army of demons on Earth. The game is full of racist jokes, which some will definately find offensive, but others will find funny as these aren't supposed to be taken seriously and is the game's humor. The gameplay is fast with tons of weapons to use, from a katana to dual wielded uzis, and shurikens to the decapitated head of a demon that shoots fire. Pretty insane stuff. The levels are big and explorable with secrets (try finding all of the easter eggs) and collectibles. For a free game it is DEFINATELY worth playing","December 22, 2013","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Oh, it's a... wait, it's a... it's a car! And it has an alarm! Wow!". You can feel designers were inspired by the freedom and limits of the 3D in 1996, building a world like a child would out of lego-like constructor, and Shadow Warrior shows a good example of this pixelated creativity. Crazy weapons, crazy enemies, crazy levels - it was all new back then, and you can feel it. Today's games, made after so much was done, just can't have that feel of novelty and inspiration. Now that it's free, it's something to definitely play once - even if just to get a glimpse of 3D games history. Shadow Warrior is not the best of Build engine games, but it's definitely got some memorable moments.","January 27, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The engine is far more sophisticated than even Blood, and dwarfs what was possible in Duke 3D. While I don't have a large amount of time on this computer, I have played Shadow Warrior extensively. It has that classic pc presentation, so graphics are excellent, if not for the low resolution. The only problem I have with the game is the crushing difficulty, often times getting obliterated in moments after my last quick load, and needless to say can lead to immense frustration. It's a real shame, because when the gore is flying, the guns are blazing, and you're strafing and jumping non-stop; the game is a superlative example of Old-School FPS. However, even so I feel Blood and Duke did the difficulty better, it really is a crushing game. But all problems I have with the game can be wiped away with one simple sweep: it's free. So of course I recommend playing it, it's not going to waste your hard drive space, your wallet isn't any lighter, and you can find out how you feel personally about the game.

As a free to play game it is amazing. Of course you can just play the free version but, to really enjoy the game get Redux it includes controler support, achievements, the expansion packs and more. This free version is great to see if you will like the game and want the full version. An old FPS filled with Japanese movie references and some racist jokes ranging from mild to not too far. Kill enemies with your katana! See all the blood and hear the one liners! Definate recommendation. Again if you want more Redux is available.","November 3, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atarirobblestains/recommended/238070/","atarirobblestains","atarirob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atarirobblestains/","12 products in account","Product received for free\n\nGreat classic FPS from 3D Realms, runs really well on my PC, but I use my Mac for school and like to play classic games like this in my spare time on it, but unfortunately it runs terribly, and games like Half Life 2, Quake III and CS 1.6 and even Morrowind all run at 50 or 60 FPS (CS 1.6 runs at 80). I don't know why it's like this, but otherwise, the game is great, but not for those who just want a Doom I or II experience, it's not a run and gun killfest, you really have to take it slow and think a lot of the time, sometimes being stuck in one level for 15 or 20 minutes (just like 3D Realms previous games, Blood and Duke Nukem 3D (which really needs to be on Steam, but you can get eDuke32 and run it at 1280x800)). If you were annoyed after a bad day at school or work, this game would just ♥♥♥♥ you off with it's sometimes overly complex linear level design, brutally unforgiving difficulty and unfortunately, sometimes underpowered weapons like the riot shotgun that reminds me more of a Nerf gun than a shotgun. Other than that, the game still looks cool and has a lot of charm, as does any 3D Realms game really, the protagonist is hilarious, maybe even more so than Duke Nukem himself. The enemies are your generis old school FPS carbon copy Doom clones, the weapons are half good half terrible but for what the game lacks in creativity, it makes up for in overall charm. I would recommened this if you have a PC, but if you're wanting to play it on Mac, i wouldn't even try, it's so poorly optimized it may as well not exist.","May 29","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
