A unique and interesting concept quickly tires itself out and becomes bland and repetitive.\n\nWith around 120 levels it's a game that really overstays its welcome.  Each set of three levels introduces a gimmicky twist to the gameplay- I feel safe with saying gimmick because all but the most fundamental of them are promptly thrown out the window and never seen again.  There is no cohesiveness to the design that brings all these scattershot elements together into something greater.  A lot of them are poorly implemented, frustrating to use, or just plain boring anyway- if you do happen to find a mechanic you like, you'll probably never see it again.\n\nA broader problem is that it's supposed to be a puzzle game, but has failed to puzzle me in any way.  I've rarely been stumped on how to approach a problem; instead it all seems kind of obvious.The only real difficulty I've had in finishing a level is from frustrating deaths due to a combination of insta-kill falls/spikes, the poor mechanics mentioned above, and the lack of checkpoints in levels.  A lot of the levels take far too long and offer far too much room for mistakes to not include any sort of checkpoint.  I wouldn't speak too highly of the level design itself either.\n\nUnless it's something you're receiving in a bundle of some sort and just want to try out for a little bit, I cannot recommend Snapshot at all.   A lot of potential seems wasted with such a unique core mechanic behind it.  It is an exercise in frustration rather than problem solving; repetiveness rather than innovation.","October 1, 2014","false","14.6"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

Cut, paste. Cut, paste.\n\nThe constant deletion and reproduction of content experienced playing Snapshot feels like the perfect counterpoint to its almost schizophrenic eagerness to continually replace mechanics, too insecure with the ideas its putting forward to ever spend long enough on any given one to actually develop it into more than a one off curiosity. The only constant is your ability to copy certain objects and then place them elsewhere in a level, but Snapshot treats its core mechanic as a novelty, one I quickly grew aggravated with as I attempted to work with its unwieldy interface.\n\nBasic movements are already stiff and awkward, making rudimentary jumps hazardous and unpredictable, but trying to frame and position objects while avoiding obstacles at the speed you're often forced to is agonizing. I was constantly falling onto hazards and screwing up puzzles because I wasn't able to move my frame quick enough to grab an object, and this only becomes worse the longer you play as the game abandons any notion that it understands the weaknesses of its interface.\n\nNearly every chapter brings with it a new concept for you to work with, be it magnets or fireballs, but they're so briefly utilized that Snapshot is never able to build any sort of mechanical vocabulary. I never knew what I could or couldn't do or how different items interacted with one another because Snapshot never tells you, and spends so little time using any of its ideas that you're constantly going through tutorials and then being told the thing you just learned is irrelevant beyond your immediate puzzle. Snapshot's kitchen sink approach to game design also completely abolishes its difficulty slope. As it has to continually stop to tell you how something works, it creates a series of levels that vary erratically in challenge, some obnoxiously difficult while others only ask you to press right and jump. Completely a challenging puzzle only to have it followed up by one that was almost insultingly easy made it feel like my time was being deliberately wasted. Snapshot has more ideas than it has levels to hold them, so it forces you to spend needless amounts of time within a single level so as to make it appear as if whatever mechanic its currently using has any place in the game.\n\nAnd a handful of them are kind of cool, but they're buried deep in a game that's too busy trying on clothes it doesn't fit to notice the parts that work. Even if it had, I have little hope it would have had any more luck utilizing them when Snapshot's foundation struggles to hold itself together during even the simplest moments. Retro Affect has stuffed their game to the point of breaking with content, but it seems to suggest even they realized most of what's here needn't be, as you can see the ending after less than half the game is actually finished. It's a silver lining I quickly took advantage of, but hardly something to recommend a game over.","February 8, 2015","false","4.6"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","18","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/204220/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Platformers really need a unique hook to do well these days, and Snapshot certainly comes through on that front. Your little robot dude can take pictures of the world that save the items he snaps in them. He can then load the picture back into reality, rotating it to fit whatever the situation calls for. Pictures also capture motion, so if you snap a flying crate, it'll still be speeding through the air when you bring it back. Add in 120 levels to puzzle through, along with stars to collect and hidden objects to find, and you've got a quality mix, right?\n\nYou would, if the levels weren't designed by a sadist. Snapshot has one massive flaw, and it's the level design. Not five levels in, you'll start encountering death spikes that force you to start the whole level over. There are no lives and no checkpoints, so even on the larger sprawling levels, one misstep can cost you a lot of time. Worse than that, many of the puzzles in the game can be rendered impossible to solve, forcing a restart of the level. This is because many levels like to make you stack objects to scale tall walls or shafts, and then continue using those items later in the level. Of course, if you fall back down after moving your items to the top, there's no way to get them back. The very first level involving springs is very easy to ruin if you do any exploring whatsoever.\n\nI want to say it's a shame, but honestly all Snapshot has going for it is the picture gimmick. The graphics are clean and cute but nothing special. There's no story to speak of, or if there is it's locked behind dozens of aggravating levels. Really, puzzle platformers come down to their level design, and if it's crap, nothing can save it. Surely there's already another platformer out there that uses the same or a similar system to greater effect. And even if there isn't, Snapshot certainly isn't worth braving just for that.","February 13","false","1.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

In the beginning it was delightful to use the 'snapshot' ability to solve puzzles, do some simple platforming, and perform simple tricks. The graphics are simple. As far as I've seen, the narrative is purely visual - no text or voice acting.\n\nAs the game progresses, the platforming puzzles become increasingly complex and interesting. The puzzles were creative and varied. However, the actual platforming gets tedious and frustrating.  I loathed the many puzzles that required double jumping on a spring using the 'snapshot' ability.\n\nI would recommend playing this game in small sessions over a long period of time.

It becomes quickly frustrating to start a level all the way over when you fall into spikes right near the end of the level due to the poor floaty controls of your character. Also new mechanics are quickly added into the game, for example springs get added one level and then the next some elephants get added all which are implemented poorly and become difficult to utilize.

You take objects by taking their picture and replace them by untaking their picture. You can collect stars along the way, take pictures of special objects and try to beat the fastest times.\n\nThere are 100+ levels and they are divided into groups of 3. Each group introduces and highlights a new object. Most of the objects only make appearances in their group of 3. The first level of each group are the shortest with the second and third being progressively longer. Collecting the stars and special objects also adds quite a bit of length to a level. There are no checkpoints, So most failures require you to redo the whole level.\n\nWhich objects to place where is the meat of the game, But that is pretty obvious most of the time. The puzzle aspect comes into play most when figuring out how to get things into or out of no picture taking zones. Again not that difficult. The hardest part of the game is when you have to perform some mid-air photography acrobatics. Which can get quite annoying as you'll have to play the entire level over again just give it another try if you fail. It presents itself as being a casual game, and for the most part it is, But it has these areas that require patience and persistence.\n\nIt's an OK game, best played in short sessions. I went for the extra stuff and got them all up until the last 5 or 6 levels. At that point a failed jump was crashing the game making it very hard to figure out what to do next. So I skipped the rest and just finished out the game at 81% complete.\n\nMarginal thumbs up.","February 1","true","23.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There was just enough new concepts introduced to keep me playing, but I found the difficulty of the game to not be in the puzzle-solving but in the controls.

Definitely needs to let you set your own controls (wasd without an option for "w" as jump instead of space? Seriously?)

Maybe a beginner in the platform kind of game, or a kid (totally suitable for a kid with fairy graphics and mood, no violence, ...) who has a lot of patience.\n\nNo level editor provided (or I didn't noticed it).","July 15, 2015","false","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before looking at this I had the insane idea of trying to complete the time trials, get the hidden object and collect all the stars in each stage. The time trial times are completely unforgiving and after the 10th or 11th level the tedium made me want to stop completely and just play the levels without getting anything. But at that point the frustration had set in and every new level made me think, who in their right minds would bother will all this?\n\nThe level of precision needed to even complete some levels (specifically, bouncing and snapping up the item just after you've bounced) finally did me in. Games this difficult need to give you a reason to continue, more than the vainglory of proving to the world that you could 100% Snapshot. As far as I could tell, collecting stars, pictures of the special items in each level, and completing the time trials gives you nothing. We are not living in the days of the NES where money and game options are limited. When frustration and overwhelmedness are the core emotions a game provokes, it is time to put your pride in your knapsack and move on to the next world with the dream that somewhere out there love awaits.

The concept of taking pictures of items to move them is masterfully expanded upon with all kinds of tricks and tools. For the most part, puzzles are fun to figure out and satisfying to master, especially when beating those par times.\n\nI say "for the most part" because every now and then the game likes to put important objects in really stupid places. In addition, some properties of the game aren't well-taught. Most of the objects are telegraphed in a way where you can figure out what they do, but some in the later levels are just maddening.\n\nWhat's also maddening is the sheer amount of bugs in this game. Missing textures, frozen player controls, BRUTAL crashes near the end of the game, and achievements unlocking erratically are just a few of the issues I found. They weren't enough to detract from the overall experience, but it's a troubling tell, as when searching through the Discussions for this game, it's clear the developers either don't care anymore or have simply vanished off the face of the Earth.\n\nSnapshot has a weird difficulty curve and a few bugs to break you out of the experience, but overall it's inventive and fun. The music is gorgeous, and the visuals are charming, albeit a bit on the bright side. Recommended if you want a unique puzzle-platformer to last you a weekend.","October 4, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/file0/recommended/204220/","file0","file0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/file0/","165 products in account","A fun little indie platformer. To beat each stage, you'll need to take snapshots of objects, manipulating them so you can reach the end.\n\nTaking snapshots makes items disappear, and pasting them back into the world causes them to reappear for you to use. Momentum is preserved in the snapshot, so items flying by will continue flying by when pasted back into the world. You are limited 3 snapshots at any one time.\n\nThe game rates your performance on four criteria: finding and taking a snapshot of the hidden item (and taking them to the end of the stage, which means taking up one of your three snapshot slots), whether you beat the stage under par time (you've gotta be FAST), whether you collected all the stars in the stage (which are slightly attracted to you, making collection a touch easier), and whether you found all the stars in the chapter (each chapter consists of three stages).\n\nThis rating system makes the game addicting and very replayable. Each completed level's progress is saved upon completion, allowing you to immediately retry a particular stage to perfect it.\n\nThe artwork is beautiful and colorful. The game is highly polished quality. I highly recommend this fun little game.","March 26, 2013","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the entire game being built around the use of the camera, the levels still bring something new until the very end. The first few levels can be a little repetitive, you practically just uses your camera to move boxes around, but after that the game introduces new objects  (disappearing clouds, fireball throwing flowers, elephant trampolines and many others) constantly, just giving you enough time to learn how to use them before introducing something new. The majoraty of the objects are used only in a handful of levels before being dropped for something new, keeping the game always fresh. The game is very easy if you finish the level without completing any secondary goal, so I recommend to go after the secret objects and the stars for maximum enjoyment.  The graphics, although simple, are a delight to look at, evocative of the 16bit era platformers: they are exactly how you remember them being at the time, not  pixelated and low resolution as they truly are.

And the photo mechanic has something that's just so pleasantly janky about it that comes off as a little endearing and actually pretty fun when you get the hang of it.\n\nThat being said, I've never completed the game despite my fair amount of hours in it, because I've lost my save data for it about five times. I dunno if that just happened because I'm dumb or because the developer put the save data in the cache or something like that.","April 5","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

HOWEVER, the platforming controls for the character are far too loose, floaty, slidey, mushy, pick your adjective.  Alas, I cannot recommend this in good faith for anyone beyond those who seek out specifically this kind of "puzzle" game.
