"http://steamcommunity.com/id/octupus8/recommended/345120/","octupus8","Dr. Phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/octupus8/","398 products in account","Allow me to preface this by saying that I adored Vox Populi Vox Dei 1. I played it all the time in high school and loved it, it was a welcome change of pace from the standard flash platformers that overwhelm the market and was challenging, but still fair. I'm also a seasoned veteran of the platformer genre.\n\nWith that out of the way I need to state that Vox Populi 2 is not Vox Populi 1.\n\nVP1 was a puzzle game with a side-scroller facade. There were minor platforming elements, but on the whole the game's focus was progressing past the baddies in your way by a means of stealth, planning and timing. Platforming mechanics like death pits and jumping gaps took a backseat to the design elements of the game.\n\nVP2, however, tosses most of this out the window and stages itself like your typical indie platforming game. It has spike traps, projectile hazards, and jumping puzzles. A lot of the game relies on trial and error and sheer persistence to get through, so much so in fact that I feel compelled to compare it to "I Wanna Be the Guy".\n\nAt this point, although episodic, the story feels almost negligable. While the first game's plot was simple yet engaging, the story to this point has taken so many twists and turns that it feels more like a parody then something I'm interested in seeing through to the end.\n\nThe learning curve is pretty relentless as well: I found myself dying more than dozens of time on the first level of platforming. Maybe I'm just rusty, but I'm more inclined to blame the game's controls. They're simply not tight enough for the kind of precision platforming that VP2 demands of it's player. They feel slippery and it takes too long in some cases to get the horizontal momentum you need to be making it from platform A to platform B, which is why I found myself needing to take most of the jumps while hanging off the edge of platform A to compensate. In a game where you need to be making sudden stops and precise landings the controls should be built to match it.\n\nAttacking werewolves also feels much less rewarding because of the controls, since mashing the space bar to do it at maximum speed is no longer an option. It seems to me to be because the player character can make another slash at his enemy after the previous attacking animation has ended. This makes the mashing feeling of destroying another creature feel far less rewarding and take the same amount of time every time instead of spurting blood on every key press a-la VP1.\n\nThe level design is poor as well. There are many cases in which you'll be committing to blind jumps and falls, relying primarily on the level to give you a checkpoint or platform to land safely onto. Even the spacing of checkpoints is relentless, one of the first jumping segments has you complete six different finicky jumping segments before allowing you a checkpoint.\n\nThere's another level early on where you encounter a machine stamping the floor of a hallway with spikes from above. By and large it's your standard 'wait until this hazard stops functioning before moving past it' type of timing puzzle, but it takes a good 10 seconds before complete its loop, which feels far too long to be waiting around to study it's pattern. What's more is there are 4 of them, each one is larger then the last and takes longer to complete as a result. Big elements of the design just feel poorly thought out at times which drags the gameplay to a screeching halt.\n\nThe design does attempt a few interesting turns later on when a stage uses it's blood particle mechanic to help the player see platforms. But for some reason it decides it needs a space shooter stage and a level that mirrors the player on the top and bottom half of the screen, forcing you to keep both sides alive. On the whole it's nothing that hasn't been used in a platformer game before, and to better effect then it achieves, so the question remains as to why they would choose to implement it at all?\n\nDesign issues aside, that's my main point of contention. I'm just left bewildered as to why the creators decided to scrap the puzzle formula to adopt a platformer approach. Vox Populi 1 was a game that used it's puzzle game design to great effect and I really was excited to see all the places a sequel could possibly go. However Vox Populi 2 just adapts to a saturated market and is just another platformer which makes the sequel immensely disappointing, and it's certainly not the game I was hoping for it to be.\n\n\n-----------\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nIf you're a fan of difficult indie platformer/action games and willing to lose one or two lives to design choices, this game may be for you.\n\nBut\n\nIf you're expecting a sequel to Vox Populi 2 in the same style of gameplay, you may want to hold off on playing this one.","May 1, 2015","false","2.0"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","49","64","0","1"

(at least where i'm at, i've beaten the game halfway and will update this review when i finish it). it's not really for everyone in this aspect\n\nthe platforming is VERY wonky and slip-slidey to begin with but you get used to it fast. beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of the werewolves is a lot more satisfying in this game because they're a lot harder to get at, but the button-mashing doesn't really feel right. minor inconvenience at most. just realize that it's probably gonna take 4-5 seconds to kill them compared to the first game, which was a lot faster if i remember correctly\n\nthe graphics are nice, gives me an "another world" vibe. before you complain about the pixel aesthetic keep in mind that the first one was made in a time before that kind of stuff became the norm. music is almost non-existant for atmospheric reasons, i'd assume.\n\nverdict: a nice little puzzler that's worth its price but not for everyone. if you're on the fence about it, wait for a sale.","March 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","2"

Make no mistake. This game is hard.\nA Gameplay & Review video showcasing the features I will talk about\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x69ZYchAjSo\nKilling enemies is satisfying as you mash the button to rip out their guts, and see blood with cool physics cover your environment.\nThe game doesn't always play music, but when it does, it makes moments that much better. The soundtrack is very cool.\nThere are bosses, which look cool but lack as much diversity as the rest of the levels. They mostly play the same way.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the game was how main gameplay mechanics constantly change. At one point you'll being doing some basic, but hard platforming. The next moment you'll be in a flying segment shooting at enemies ahead of you. The next will have you worry about 2 characters at once, running through asymmetrical levels for each.\n\nI play hard platformers regularly, and am quite damn good at them. The first few levels were decently tough, but not much to get me frustrated. I'm a bit halfway now and the game is quite challenging. Not in a bad or frustrating way, which is good. The controls are very tight, so you don't feel cheated when you die.\n\nOverall, it's a really cool little game that improves on everything from the first game.

Unfortunately, the first one in the series (launched in 2009) is not yet available on Steam. I have played both for quite a few hours and I’m pleased to say that we’re dealing with a worthy sequel here, which only improves upon the foundation of the series. This may be Great Cogs’ first game on Steam, but they managed to provide a fine pixelart platformer with plenty of gore and diversity. It most certainly stands out from your run-of-the-mill platforming games.\n\nGameplayVox Populi Vox Dei 2 has medium-sized levels with both enemies (werewolves) and obstacles to pass through. The platforming sections are balanced with combat and several puzzles along the way. It may seem a bit difficult after the first few levels, as the game has boss fights and one of the few gameplay flaws, has to be the limited number of checkpoints found between the levels. It is true that the old school platformers had next to no saving system, but the mark of a modern game has to be it’s potential to pick up and also pause or leave the game state intact, between gaming sessions. This is indeed a game in which you get used to dying quite a lot so having to restart the level or even further than that, might become troublesome for some new players.\n\nThe game’s graphics are more than decent and the slightly limited color palette fits the atmosphere. The character sprites are well made and the many gory ways to die within the game provide ample animation diversity. The level design doesn’t get repetitive fast and there over 50 levels to complete.\n\nThe game’s sounds and music fit the style and while it is most certainly not as limited as many other platformers, some sounds do get repetitive eventually. Quite rare for a 2D platformer, are the presence of ingame cinematics Not once did the game steer away from it’s intended lycanthrope theme.\n\nPros\n+ Classic type of gameplay\n+ Horror and gore themes are well defined\n+ Pleasant graphics and character sprites\n+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n\n\nCons\n- It requires some trial and error\n- The checkpoint save system is quite sparse\n- A few repetitive sounds\n\nResult / Final thoughts\nThis game never felt boring and while it did prove a bit difficult, the story was worth it. For a platformer, it mixed very well the gory elements along with combat sections and obstacle avoiding. The checkpoints could have been a bit more but once you get accustomed to the levels, passing them was never too hard. It is a game which knows it’s value and provides both Achievements and Trading Cards, making it a good addition to any Steam game collector and not just the nostalgic platforming gamers looking for a new challenge.\n\nRating 8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.","June 5","true","3.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

This game has truly frustrated me, but I love it. This game has certain checkpoints, and once you die you will reset at said checkpoint. There is one point in the cave portion of the game, fairly early on, where there are sections that are rather long without checkpoints. You'll know what I mean.

Some of the checkpoints are either too close together or too far apart, and some of the challenges are almost TOO hard (like the flying challenge, especially condidering the distance between check points in that stage; or the all-white challenge inside the worm, though I generally enjoyed that). Another slightly annoying thing was the time it took for boss fights to start (maybe shorten the bosss' intro after the player's first death and respawn?) after dying and reterying repeatedly. Some of the aspects just felt like they took to long, especially since the player is probably going to die and have to retry kind of a lot. My final complaint is that it's a little short. Ultimately though, I enjoyed this game. I STRONGLY suggest playing the first part before this one (it's a free flash game; you should be able to find it by googling it).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inkerius/recommended/345120/","inkerius","The Inker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inkerius/","393 products in account","Textbook player-hostile design.\n\nEven early in the game, everything seems to require almost frame-perfect timing.  A lot of seemingly simple rooms have incredibly unintuitive design that's going to kill you multiple times before you divine what the game really wants you to do.  Lots of elements seem to be timed specifically to kill a player who tries to move through quickly and smoothly, forcing you to wait.  Checkpoints are too infrequent for a game with this kind of difficulty, often requiring a player to re-complete a puzzle or sit through some auto-scrolling (seriously, every auto-scroller checkpoint has about three seconds of waiting after respawn for absolutely no reason) just to get back to where they died.  There's even at least one room that requires luck in order to complete.\n\nTop it all off with some incredible tonal inconsistency that manages to make even the admittedly-good art design sometimes feel out-of-place, slippery controls that make the precise movements it demands impossible, and a shooter section with an incredibly unforgiving hitbox (and EVERY ENEMY BULLET will block yours and keep on going), and what we have here is something I would not recommend even this meager price for.\n\nGo play the first one; you can find it online for free.  It is far, FAR better than this travesty.  Play that, and stay away from this one.","January 11","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anywho, you are paying nothing compared to the amounts of fun and challenge this game can bring to yourself. The controls are smooth and 100% responsive, the art design is pleasant to one's eye, and the 60-ish levels available to play present various gameplay variety, never getting you bored.\n\nI must say, killing werewolfs is amazing, as you watch all the blood come out (blood which is very well designed). The soundtrack is also a plus, and it's striking when a moment of action comes along.\n\nHonestly, Vox Populi Vox Dei 2 should be more expensive.

The best way to pass this part is to dodge and not fight back, taking the combat out of the only interesting combat level in the game.\n- If you didn't enjoy the repetitive hazards, just wait until you have to control two characters through them simultaneously!","March 10","false","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developer is a genius, fusing unique mechanics, fantastic artwork, puzzle elements, cool effects and a relentless pace which tells a story in-game, owing a lot to games like Another World or even Oddworld. The game feels like a very polished collection of those old flash games, which would give you a new mechanic and then let you toy with it for a few levels. I love the pace of this game, it might be incredibly frustrating, but clearing an area will reward you with almost an entirely new game straight afterwards. The level of artistry, originality.. its pretty rare and the developer has clear talent, there also can be a lot of careful nuance in the level design regarding pacing/reward/memorable moments.\n\nBut the game has some big issues. Mainly its sketchy collision hitboxes which rely on the entire sprites size (transparent areas around the actual graphics), instead of what you'd perceive to be the actual collision - and reliance on trial/error/memorization level design. The flying area, i feel, really doesn't belong in the game and lacks everything that makes the rest of the game interesting.\n\nOverall, the experience is more than worth it, especially for this cheap price. The game has big flaws, but it has massive redeeming factors. There are also several hillarious moments, which i won't spoil.","September 22, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even when this game is about puzzles, it still shows it's potential to easely teach how to play levels on their first stages.\nNo "water". Levels(sic) and story escalating quickly. Little to none gameplay repetition.\nEven pixelated it looks mostly beautiful and even impressive. As I said before, this game is very well crafted for it's kind, the effort is noticable.\nIn my opinion, VPVD2 is underpriced.","September 25, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
