Toren will take you around two hours to complete, perhaps a little more if you really like to soak up the scenery.\n\nIf you demand precise, responsive controls, this ain't the game for you either. Toren involves a little combat (pretty clunky) and a lot of platforming (anywhere from okay to very clunky).\n\nArt design, world design and character design are where Toren shines.

Much like ICO and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons before it, you take on the role of a young girl simply known as the moonchild whose fate it appears is to ascend a daunting tower and slay a menacing dragon and in the process learn that the ways of the world are often cruel and spiteful as you depart childhood for a grey and morally ambiguous adult world. You initially start the game as a young toddler who has to learn to crawl before she can learn to walk and over the course of the time it takes to clear the game you will get to watch her grow into a young woman. Much like the beloved ICO before it you will need to guide your young protagonist around a large and looming tower littered with an assortment of puzzles. Having said that, that is where all similarities with ICO should end. While ICO was an utter joy to play that left deep and lasting impressions, Toren is muddle of ideas (some great, some not) that seem to have been sloppily sewn together.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=533023553\nThe biggest problem with Toren is that in the short time it takes to clear the game (2-3 hrs depending on your playstyle) the central mystery around why this girl finds herself born to such a fate is never really clearly explained. Pulling in mysticism and philosophy from various religions and told through simple yet cryptic poetry, Toren ends up being its own Tower of Babel leaving audiences more confused then when they started. These pieces of prose are often so cryptic and vague they end up not really telling you much at all which leaves Toren in a bit of an unfortunate predicament. There is very little to piece together and what pieces there are don't really inform the player much about this mysterious world. If you are the kind of gamer that likes their stories to be direct, clear and precise and not beat about the bush then approach Toren with caution because it could end up frustrating you no end. While I don't particularly mind the fashion the story is presented in, and while I don't necessarily need everything spelt out for me, I would have liked a bit more to cash in on because it would have only increased my vested interest rather than simply going through the motions to reach an end.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=533220404\nOne can't fault Swordtales when it comes to artistic merit. Toren can sometimes be downright beautiful to look at even when character and environment models appear blocky and washed out. Toren in many ways resembles a painting that appears to have taken on a life of its own and climbing the tower can be a visual delight as you watch your young charge grow from a baby into a fine young woman all the while navigating some incredibly creative scenery. During your ascend to the top of the tower seasons will pass in and out which manages to frame the game beautifully giving it the sense of passing time. However, as creative as the visuals can get sometimes, the games puzzle elements and controls leave a lot to be desired. It almost feels like they were an afterthought where at some point the developers seem to have realized that this fairy tale needed something to make it represent a game so they ran roughshod through the genre tropes that barely function and only just. Nothing in Toren will tax your brain or have you scratching your head in perplextion as you try to figure out what to do next. The game mechanics seem to come off even worse with jumping and climbing being an incredibly clunky and downright shoddy affair. Combat, yes there is a wee bit to be found - remember you are here to slay a dragon - shows no improvement either. While they function just don't come into this world expecting precision and smoothness.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528536577\nMy biggest gripe however with the game comes from the games camera that will insist on always rotating to get the most cinematic view. While it certainly does help get some glorious and grand screenshots it actually ends up handicapping the player more than anything else. It's a static camera so you have no control over how it is going to present the next frame and it often leaves the player at a slight disadvantage because of what they can no longer see in front of them.\n\nAt the end of the day I left Toren's world feeling ambivalent. While I certainly didn't hate my short time spent playing the game, neither did it delight and charm me in the ways ICO and Brother: A Tale of Two Sons did. While I certainly don't not recommend you dive in and give it a try - because as they say one man's trash is another mans gold - Toren took key concepts that were unique and creative and that were the reason my interest was initially piqued and then spun them off into the deep end of the abyss of mediocre. One for a sale most definitely!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 12, 2015","true","4.9"," 200 of 228 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","200","228","7","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/320820/","seph_au","seph.au","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/","6757 products in account","Toren tells the story of Moonchild, a silent young woman seeking purpose for her existence. Rather then laying the entire plot out in onscreen text or 5 hours worth of tutorials most of the story is told via subtle symbolism and metaphors related to ancient cultures and myths. With no hud, 30+ button quick time events or loud dub-step music, Toren takes simplicity in story telling back to it's roots. Familiar with classic games like ICO, Papo & Yo or Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons? It's a very similar experience. Don't be expecting nonstop action or a hack and slash game, much slower paced and more about the journey not the destination.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOj3V9AGZ3I\nFor those concerned puzzles were not a gamebreaker, mostly environmental or simple logic. Can get a little confusing all the back and forward between worlds and traversing of the tower as it regenerated but personally I thought it was half the charm. Trying not to spoil too much, you play alternate pathways and learn from experience. Still not having completely wrapped my head around the story but it's what will bring me back.\n\nSoundtrack is amazing and really added to the experience, much of the time left wondering where the music was then realizing it had just alternated tempo so well it had blended into the on-screen action. Controls were simple though I would definitely suggest using a gamepad. Keyboard and mouse is functional but far from being an optimal experience.\n\nFans of a good story, beautiful scenery or some outside the box mechanics should certainly give Toren the once over. While it's quite short in nature and can be played through in several hours, don't let that stop you as it's worth experiencing more then once. Cheers folks. :)\n\nEDIT:\nFull playthrough below, Would advise playing it yourself if still interested though.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLslfvIJAupsyx0-2cxWb8O6Ql7h7dQFJU","May 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 148 of 213 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","148","213","5","17"

The tower, silent and immovable, is your home, your prison and your destiny. Through ascending the tower, the tree of life begins to grow, as do you, through the trials laid out before you. The premise behind Toren is fantastic and its story laden with philosophy and meaning but sadly, fails in the execution of these concepts. I often felt as though the game was telling me too much rather than leaving me to infer meaning from the environment and gameplay. Instead of an experience where you slowly learn the truth yourself by looking around and piecing together the story, you are outright told what’s happening, albeit in a vague, abstract manner. The result being that nothing in the game is a surprise – there are no revelations and the story ends all too quickly. You aren’t left pondering the meaning of the tale because aside from what the game gives you, there’s nothing left to find or interpret. There are some solid concepts on display here, but they are conveyed in a largely linear and boring manner.\n\nGameplayRepetition is a consistent theme within Toren, as moonchild is trapped in an endless cycle of death and rebirth, sadly this motif also extends into the gameplay which is largely repetitive and dull. The game contains two major concepts which are recycled constantly – standing behind objects so that you won’t be blown away by strong winds, and tracing shapes with salt, and yes, both of them are about as exciting as they sound. As sad as it may seem, these really are the two main things you’ll be doing in Toren aside from, of course, walking and climbing. There is incredibly little  by way of exploration with only a small handful of trinkets to obtain, while the environments remain sparse, linear and void of interaction.\n\nNot far into her ascent, Moonchild will acquire a sword allowing her to fend off enemies (of which there are only two types, including the final boss). The sword swinging animation is clunky and unsatisfying – moreover enemies can be defeated just by spamming  attack when they jump at you or simply avoided altogether. Platforming is equally unimpressive; seldom requiring any kind of timing or precision, most jumps complete themselves, dragging Moonchild into the correct spot. The fixed perspective camera angles also do little to assist in navigation, often making a short hop resemble a wide gap, and vice versa. The jumping animation itself is slow and floaty with no weight behind it. One nice little nuance is the way moonchild stumbles after jumping – it adds nothing to the gameplay but is an obvious nod to the movement in Ico, which I can appreciate. When examined as a whole, not one element of Toren’s gameplay shines through and the few “puzzles” (and I use the term loosely) that are present fail to be anything more than an inconvenience.\n\nBut it is perhaps the less tangible gameplay experiences that makes Toren somewhat endearing. Throughout the game you will enter various dream-like states, each representing an aspect of humanity and manifesting itself accordingly from an underwater abyss to a fiery temple. Visiting these planes is arguably one of the better parts of the game; their environments are unique and varied and help to reinforce the game’s message. Sadly, they don’t bring with them much actual gameplay – these areas seemed like the perfect chance to mix in some new challenging elements and while each one does provide a slightly different slant on the gameplay, they are short lived and lacking in any real challenge or depth.\n\nAudio/VisualsToren’s obvious strong suit is its game world – artistically and musically, the game is certainly appealing and may even be worth playing for them alone. Toren isn’t going to win any awards for its graphical fidelity – many textures and animations look pretty poor, but the art style is enough to carry the game despite these flaws. The game draws upon a number of philosophical and mystical concepts in its inspiration but most notably Norse mythology: the Tree of Life (Ygdrassil), The Jormungard motif of endless rebirth, and Toren itself being the Dutch word for tower – nothing is without reason. This theme is pretty consistent and fits the mood of the game’s soundtrack which is suitably sombre and reflective. Sadly, while the original scores for Toren are well composed, the game’s sound design is notably sub-par, doing little to achieve any sense of immersion in the atmosphere as well as multiple actions and events making no sound at all.\n\nConclusionThere’s not a whole lot more to say about Toren without ruining what little story there is and without highlighting particular instances where the game could be improved – it is what it is – a poor game bundled up in a unique piece of art. Critically, Toren doesn’t know what kind of game it is, it dabbles with a number of mechanics and falls short of the mark at every point, the result is a brief, dull, repetitive experience. And so, a warning – while I am recommending this game I need to make the following things clear. Firstly, do not purchase this game at full price, wait for a sale and grab it cheap, the length and breadth of this game do not warrant the initial price point, modest as it may be. Don’t go into this game expecting the next Ico, any similarities it bears to the PS2 classic are purely superficial, that being said, if you enjoy atmpspheric, abstract stories, Toren may be of some appeal. For an indie studio’s first outing, Toren is a mixed blessing, while it pales mechanically to its forebears, the world, story and art of Toren are unquestionably impressive. Swordtales deserves credit for that at the very least, and hopefully, their next project will address the issues present in this one.\n\nPros:\n+Unique world/setting\n+Abstract, philosophical story\n+Fantastic art\n\nCons:\n-Too short\n-Mechanically unimpressive across the board\n-Narrative can be a little too direct\n-Linear\n\nScore: 5/10\n=========================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","43","53","10","4"

Her journey has her ascending a tower to restore some semblance of balance to the universe, all the while re-discovering the nature of her past.\n\nWith respect to the gameplay mechanics, Toren doesn’t conspire to deliver an enjoyable experience. The puzzles are simple, generic & do not feel rewarding once solved. The platforming elements are equally as generic & can be downright buggy. The combat, while rare in the game, is extremely unsatisfying. There are combat glitches which when encountered merited a suicide in order to progress. The camera & controls didn’t feel fluid even while playing with a controller – the game’s suggested input device.\n\nThe art style is a flattering backdrop to the story. The game does look downright gorgeous at times, featuring varying colorful environments. Though, there were a number of graphical glitches, including flickering textures. The soundtrack is composed of 23 unique tracks & is fittingly soothing.\n\nToren is peppered with symbolism, mysticism & poetry so much so that much of it fails to enhance the actual plot of the story. You will encounter story-integral mysticism which pulls from several major religious themes. Much of the poetry is divulged through cut-scenes which cannot be skipped & much of it borders on clichéd one-liners.\n\nIn conclusion, Toren doesn’t seem to have a solitary idea of what it wants to be. It’s a combination of poorly developed platforming, puzzle & combat elements with a unique art style, slapped on what could have very well been a great story. However, Toren is certainly different & worth a look if seeking a title with a heavy mystical bias without the expectation of anything genre defining.\n\n5.5/10","May 13, 2015","true","5.9"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","50","66","3","9"

Don't let the sword in the picture fool you. Toren is a game of discovery, that happens to have a sword sometimes. This third person adventure game will take you on a journey exploring the existence of a girl and her quest in a tower against her nemesis: a dragon.\n\nRight the wrongs of the past and restore balance as you play a child/girl/woman, exploring the tower and entering dreams to follow in the steps of great men. Can you slay the dragon and restore order to the universe? Only time will tell.\n\nStory: The story is rather confusing, there were aspects of it I didn't quite understand. One cut scene is repeated over and over and though the text is different, I am not completely sure of the symbolism behind it. That's probably a failing of mine though.... perhaps it's clearer to others. There are times when the game doesn't really prepare you for what will happen next. I almost quit a few times because I thought, "Hey, that's not my fault...." only to discover... that was intended by the game on purpose. Upon completing the game, I didn't get a grand sense of achievement, though I did enjoy myself.\n\nSounds: The sounds are pretty good. I rather enjoyed it, however, there are times when distance plays zero part in what is happening in the game. There are these critters you can kill and they are just as loud when they are on the other side of a wall as when you are standing next to them. So that can be a little confusing if you're hoping to home in on them via their noises.\n\nGraphics: There's something about the graphics that are both appealing and not at the same time. While great attention to detail has been paid to certain areas of the game, others seem to be thrown together as a last ditch effort to complete the game. Or they intended them that way. If that's the case, I'm not really sure where I stand on the issue. However, there is little graphic smoothing and at one point when you're wearing a cape, and it's kinda flowing in and out of your body, it doesn't really jive and looks a little sloppy. I also wasn't a fan of her hair at certain points. Seemed like they cut a few corners there. Also, there were some areas where it seemed like in order to mask the lack of completeness, they blurred out the edges of the screen, trusting in the setting of the game to make you not question it. But I did.\n\nControls: The controls are a bit clunky sometimes. If you want her to walk in a different direction, you have to hope she will immediately reverse, but that often doesn't happen, she tends to go off slightly to a different direction. This probably has to do with my major complaint about the game which will get it's own section. Combat is pretty much a joke, and seems thrown in as an after thought. There can be monsters right in front of you, and when you attack, your character swings the sword parallel to the ground, instead of at the monster. Doing a combo of attacks will eventually get you a down stroke which will kill it. This was not pleasing for me or entertaining.\n\nThe Blasted Camera: Seriously, I've never had a game screw with me so much just because it wants to move the camera around in whatever way it sees fit whenver it wants. Changing directions can cause the camera to zoom in or out with no real discernable reason. Further, those changes often make it so you're heading not in the exact opposite direction when you want to turn around, but rather, slightly off course because the camera changed where it was and controls are directly related to the camera's position. This was the thing I hated the most about the game. Everything else was tolerable, and I could enjoy those aspects of the game even if they weren't ideal, however, that blasted camera man in game that randomly flies around like a fairy has a sadistic streak and I hope he gets torched by a dragon.\n\nOverall: 6/10 - Base pricing is a little high, in my opinion. I'd probably have no issues paying $4-5 for this game, but I might be grumpy paying $10. If you can afford it, feel free, but I would definitely recommend a discount. There is little replayability, so you're probably gonna get 3 hours of the game tops. You may replay it to finish some of the missable acheivements, but it's not enjoyable. Thankfully you can select which chapter you want to start at once you've completed the game. It's a fun little adventure to take a stroll through, but nothing fantastic.\n\nSeriously, what's with the up skirt shot during the beginning of the game? Was that necessary?","May 28","true","9.6"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","1"

I say weird because I don't know why I liked it.\n\nI completed the game in about two hours, two very good hours mind you, and even now that I've finished it I don't know what it was I just played. Toren is supposed to be a Adventure, platform something dead baby, and it is, except for the dead baby, that I can say for certain. You do some simplistic puzzles that aren't to hard to figure out and they get more clever the further you get into the game. Some puzzles I overlooked that made them somewhat harder, like having to draw a symbol on the ground in pitch black darkness, thing was that I didn't notice was that you could get a god damn torch :/\nBut the platforming and puzzles are solid and fun and you get this very Indie feel as you play the game, character is clipping through everything for one. But aside that I really enjoyed the gameplay and thought it was fun.\n\nAnd that must be the reason I liked the game because it was the thing I didn't expect to enjoy, thus it surprised me. Why I bought the game was not because of some gameplay video, it was because of the story. I don't ♥♥♥♥ing know what the story was, I really don't. I'm more confident in guessing the contents of my friends balls then I am starting to guess the story of this game. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's a good thing, it adds replayability if anything. So I may not have understood what happened in my first run through the game, but maybe the second time will yield some results or the third. It's intresting for a game to add replayability through story rather then unlockables or new gear and the like. It could also get boring as you are forced to to the same exact thing over and over again, but since the game is so short I don't see that as a problem.\nLast thing I want to mention it that I really liked the character model, or what they did with it. The character is going through "stages" of human life (Baby, child, teenager, adult) and the model changes when I happens which I find really cool, especially the last one (I have a thing for capes!).\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable experience, I'd rather have two really good hours of gameplay and story then having to play ninety hours of things I don't want to do just to reach the end, I'm looking at you Dragon Age Inquisition!\nI heartly recommend this game!","May 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","24","32","2","0"

Swordtales proved us, that even with a low budget, the story can be narrated with lovely elements, tension and epic finale. Another great thing from Brazil! Let's see in a detail this lovely title, which tells us about pride of humanity, punishment for their crimes and a hope hidden within a girl's heart.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Greatly designed platforms\n+ Reasonably challenging puzzles\n+ Lovely story\n+ Lyrical symbols\n+ Mystic, religion,\n+ Meditiations\no Controller is an advantage\n- Few texture glitches\n\nIt can be suggestive, that the main goal is to climb upstairs, but there is more in this. Whole story is a parallel to various legends, e. g. The Tower of Babylon, so on the route to release the moonlight and defeat an ancient enemy in form of a dragon, player have to encounter various pozzles, reveal hidden aspects from the story and find out ugly truth full of despair and hope. Puzzles are reasonably tough, they require a little of wits to solve them. Beautiful lyrical ending.\n\nI encountered few texture glitches, what is not a big deal. In addition, you can play it on a keyboard, contoller is a bit of advantage, but not necessary.\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Reasonably to ist price\n- Some texture were not purely rendered\n\nVisuals are as you can expect from game like this, with a specified budget. Lovely to eye, but some textures would need another rendering and polishing. So far, so good.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Fully used potentials\no Invincible dragon\n\nBasicly, there are three characters to mention here. A girl,  for all of humanity, mage, knight. All of them have their vices and virtues, the second and the third are not playable, but equally important. They will tell us about tragic and failure of our predecessors.\n\nI understand, that dragon must last until the end. and it has its meaning, but it might appear a bit frustrating to player, that it survived several mortal wounds.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Adequately designed\n+ Lyrical tones\n+ Great credits song\n\nVinicius Kleinsorgen is another composer I started to watch. After this game, filled with sensible, soft music and great credits song, there is nothing that can be complained about. Mariana Coelho did a great performance during the credits song, whatever player seeks, joy, despair, fight or victory, can be found there.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI can not understand 58/100 from the Metascore. I admit, that this game requires a specific player to enjoy it, but it can tell something even to players out of the genre and I think, that it deserves twenty more points at minimum.\n\nI can recommend it, it is short, yet tells more story than some of hard RPGs. And that is worth a shot.","July 12, 2015","true","8.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

While it overall lacks in gameplay and focuses on story telliing and exploration, the major problem I have it more then anything else is execution. The problem comes in the details of the execution of animations and how it plays within that environment, and coming from a software engineering background, I tend to focus on those execution points (note this for bias purposess). With wings clipping in walls, player movements seeming unnatural, and climbing on invisible ledges, it takes you right out of the experience and loses the immersion factor. For those willing to put up with technical missteps, there's a good story here to follow along with, but the imprecise execution on the game gives it a pass in my book\n\n+:\nStory elements and overall themes early on good: there's a sense of wonder about the world.\nArt is fantastic. The use of bright colors and details are nice, especially when looked at at the appropriate direction.\nMusic sets the mood quite well.\n-:\nAnimation quality is awkward, and a lot of clipping issues occur. Takes you RIGHT out of the experience.\nBugs as far as the eye can see. Climbing on invisible platforms for one example.\nLacks gameplay. Unlike Ico and Brothers and the comparsions made there, there isn't exactly a lot of puzzles to work with here.\nHonestly, when it comes down to it, it feels like a story write and art director came together to create a vision, but was missing the game designer element from it. In short: it just doesn't work together and the execution of gameplay mechanics is poor.\nLacking sound elements from things like enemy hits.\nAwkward feelings at times, like using the “point to objective/look” button in the wrong spot, where it points you to the middle of space.\nFor more information and gameplay: http://youtu.be/9cTTwGRAlfs","May 12, 2015","false","1.5"," 82 of 138 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","82","138","4","5"

Unfortunately, even with the difficulty padding on one of the dream (where you need to salt draw 3 times in the dark) and tedious repetitive combat sequence at the end, it's too short.\n\nYou could argue that gameplay length is nothing if the gameplay or story is amazing (To the moon comes to mind), but the puzzles nor gameplay wasn't mindblowing or has that wow factor even though some puzzles are unique. Same with story. I was scratching my head at the end, though normally I was expecting a plot twist of some sort.\n\nDespite the game being recommended having a controller, game is still perfectly playable with a KB=M configuration.\n\nUpon starting the game, I was very excited at first when I saw the potential item upgrade rpg style gameplay mechanic, but it was nothing special except maybe for the wind anchor skill for the sword.\n\nFor graphics, the screenshots were a bit misleading. I was expecting an assassin's creed blur type quality, but the bluring was only on very few select sceneries. There was no AA setting at all (SSAO not working? there's tons of jaggies without forcing my driver to apply AA).

So much detail is packed into every nook and cranny of a scene. You can see the dust, feel the breeze of the wind, and that something strange is going on. Musically everything is superb in Toren as well. The orchestral music heightens moments in engaging fashion, What Toren reminds me of is an art piece. Beautiful to look at but functionality is simple and not complicated.\nThe puzzle elements tend to repeat themselves. From pouring of salt, to basic platforming. Combat is almost non-existent. The story is presented in the form of poetry and ambiguous cut scenes. I have beaten Toren and still don't understand what the game was all about. That isn't a bad thing though. Toren is a game that is open to interpretation and for the participant to define.\nIf you don't mind feeling lost and not having all the answers. Even when the game is done, then Toren's story is masterfully told. However some might be put off by its atypical story. The game may repeat certain puzzle elements but none of them over stay their welcome. Toren is a short game. Taking anywhere from 3 to 4 hours at most. Less, if you follow the games queues and never stray from the path. However there is secrets to be found. Even though you constantly feel as if you are being pushed forward. Toren is a game worth experiencing. Just enjoy the ride and don't worry about understanding everything.

It is a young girl's destiny to climb the massive tower and slay the dragon who has cursed the land with eternal sunshine. She ages as you play, growing in both physical and spiritual maturity in order to accomplish greater and greater feats over time. The game has a beautiful style and characters and the environment look amazing... when not moving.\n\nThe models in this game look great, but the animations do not. The main character's arms clip into her body, the dragon looks like a hand puppet, enemies cause damage-state animations that you get stuck in... The art of Toren is better ogled from screen shots than experienced first hand, I think.\n\nThat's not to even mention the gameplay, which I would describe as a sort-of puzzle game. I say sort-of because none of the puzzles are actually difficult to figure out. There is no satisfaction to be gleaned from standing behind statues to avoid wind, or hitting the dragon three times, or lighting fires with flames taken from already lit torches. Any seasoned gamer has seen those mechanics a hundred times, even if they weren't already simple and obvious. This annoyance is further enhanced when they make you repeat some of the "puzzle" solutions dozens of times. While hiding behind a statue and waiting the requisite 10 seconds for wind to die down so I could run to the next statue for the 20th or so time, I wanted to scream "I GET IT!". I solved this puzzle 10 times in the last chapter, and now you want me to do it 10 more? What am I proving by doing this? It's not hard, unless you count the game's slippery controls and floaty jumps as part of the difficulty. It's just aggravating.\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts:  This is one of those games that begs for a "It Depends." option on whether I'd reccomend it or not. It's an interesting fantasy world and game concept let down by a lack of gameplay and polish. If you are into games for the sake of art, give it a go. If you are looking for a game that is enjoyable to play, look elsewhere.","May 4","false","11.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Toren is rough around the edges in many regards; May it be the cinematic/animation or the rather cumbersome reaction to a button press gameplay-wise. But at the same time it has also a imaginative, colorful and a beautifully crafted world with a wonderful soundtrack and lore (if a bit cryptic)\n\nSo despite its flaws, I enjoyed my brief time with it. It is relatively short a game (2-4 hours for every achievement), and certainly doesn't overstay its welcome.

They are a quite amazing feat, coming from a small unknown studio. If you like art games like Ico or Journey, you should feel right at home.\n\nHowever, the gameplay could use a little more variety as some mechanics are very simple and the puzzles take almost no effort to finish. The combat would also benefit of some fine tuning as well as there are few enemies and you can just avoid them if you so wish. The boss battles, on the other hand, are very creative and fun, especially the final one. This is a game that starts out slow and just gets better as you progress through it.\n\nThe story, while confusing at first, seems to have something going for it. It may take a 2nd playthrough to understand all its subtext and because the game is short (2 to 3 hours, I believe) it actually adds to its replayability.\n\nI recommend to all those who like art games, puzzle plataformers or slow games in general. There are no AAA action packed sequences here so beware.","May 12, 2015","true","2.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

And if length is important to you then the game's short length might be an issue.

I'll be honest at times the character models were not the greatest but that's okay! It's not all about graphics its about the game itself. The story is very unique and Interesting. Generally the gameplay was pretty fun, a bit glitchy at times but overall really fun! It was a unique style of gameplay that I've never seen before and actually the whole game was very unique! It had parts in it that reminded me of games like "ico" and A bit of "legend of zelda" -esk parts. It has some little glitches but thats understandable because its a new release! At times it was a little bit challenging, especially if you haven't figured out what to do yet. If you like games that have a "penalty" for death then this one is one of those. (although it's not really a penalty, you just have to walk a long way, which can get annoying.) So, in a nutshell, this game was really fun to play and a really interesting unique game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisischris84/recommended/320820/","thisischris84","this_is_chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisischris84/","252 products in account","NOTE: At the time of writing this, I've only played about 30 mins worth of the game, so keep that in mind.\n\nToren is about the story of a young girl named Moonchild, who is the last hope for mankind. As the story explains, Man sought to end its battle with Time by building a tower, Toren, to the sky and capturing the Moon. The Sun didn't take too kindly to this. It's now up to Moonchild to defeat the Dragon and restore things.\n\nToren is a platformer with little action early on. There is some light puzzle solving (if you could call it that), but mostly it's atmospheric. Again, I've not played much & where I left off, I was in a fight with the Dragon that I lost.\n\nYou play as Moonchild in three stages; as a baby/toddler, as a young child & then as an adolescent. Early on, you're going to be mostly playing in the young child form, but alternating as the story/memories progress.\n\nWhat Toren does right:\n\n- Toren is absolutely beautiful. Similar to Life is Strange, the art style is a bit off but in a charming way. While it looks polygonal, you feel like that was the direction, rather than because they couldn't afford (or had the skillset) to make it look more crisp. I dunno how to exactly word it other than it feels right. The colors are vibrant when they want to be & dull when they're supposed to. It's very amazing how starkly it contrats & gets it right.\n\n- The story, so far, is very good. I like that, while it is a rather played out plot, the story itself is quite unique. Plus the storytelling itself is well done. I'm hooked on it.\n\n- The "puzzles" (again, so far) haven't been too difficult. People might think, "Why is that a good thing?" and, I think, this game may be more suited for a younger audience. That doesn't mean everyone won't enjoy some of it.\n\n- The music is incredible. I love it. It's so soothing and joyful to listen to, but it also gets pretty good when combat is going on, too. Overall, a very good score.\n\nWhat Toren does wrong:\n\n- The biggest gripe I have with the game, so far, is the combat. While there is very little that I've experienced, I'm not a fan of standing still when I swing my sword. Maybe it's because of the form I'm in, but I'm hoping that this changes later on, in her adolescent form.\n\n- When the narrator is talking, sometimes the background music will completely drain him out. Now, I get that he's speaking in tongues (I don't think it's actually Brazilian), but I would have rather heard him speak this language, than just the background music.\n\n- The jumping animation looks bad. You hover more than anything.\n\n- Collision issues. Walked up a flight of stairs and I couldn't proceed to the platform until I took a step back, then forward. Nothing was in my way to hinder me.\n\nScore & Recommendation:\n\nI'd give this game about a 7 out of 10. I think what it does right, it really does right. The minor things that hold it back - like the collision issues - are nothing a patch or two can't fix. But there are a few design flaws that really make you scratch your head.\n\nAt its current price, $10 USD, I would say it's definitely worth buying but understand that it is flawed (like any other game, I know). For what it brings to the table, I honestly have enjoyed my little time with it.\n\nIf anything changes as I play more, I'll update accordingly.","May 12, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It looks great, it plays (mostly) well and it has a nice tone. It's a love letter for the ones who loved games like Ico. But while it's good to look and good to play, it's not flawless. The story is interesting, but somehow I feel there's something missing, it was way too fast. It could be better if the game was longer. You'll need around 2 hours to finish the game seeing most of its content. I guess you'll need another 1 hour to see whatever you miss the first time. It isn't enough. I don't really think longer game = better game, but sometimes it's just impossible to tell a good story in such short time. There's so much they could have explored if they had the budget or whatever was necessary to make a better game. Some folks say the game is full of bugs, I couldn't find any game breaking bug, only some small things that can go unnoticed. The soundtrack is pleasant and the main character is likable. In the end, Toren is one of those game that "could have been". Is it bad? No. Is it full of bugs? I don't think so. Is it memorable? Not quite. But it's still a good experience and for $10 you should definitely pick it up.","May 13, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/plagen/recommended/320820/","plagen","Plagen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/plagen/","140 products in account","Hello folks!\n\nSo, you might be wondering about buying Toren but you are kind of skeptical about doing so. Well, allow me to give you my feelings on the game to possibly help you in your decision.\n\nI have 2.3 hours on Toren, and I'd say about 30-45min of that is because of silly mistakes I made. This brings the total time it took me to actually "beat" the game and solve the puzzles it had to a bit less than 2 hours. If you are looking for a long game, this isn't for you.\n\nHowever, if you can get past the short length you'll be met with unique graphics, that I personally enjoy. But, there are plenty of graphical issues like clipping textures, being able to see the ground under a texture because it doesn't conform to the terrain, and your character's dress ocassionally going through your legs. So it is by no means perfect.\n\nThe story is most all text based and the voices are in a made-up language (i'm pretty sure). The story is somewhat interesting, but it isn't anything majorly exciting or engaging really.\n\nSince it is an adventure game, we gotta talk about the combat. Or actually the lack there of. For the most part, you only have 3 main battles. The other monsters, which i would compare to Facehuggers from Alien die in one hit, but can also be easily avoided. You also might have to swing at a passive deer or two. The combat is just pressing the same button, so it isn't anything special.\n\nThe other MAJOR part of the game is the puzzles. Most of the game is puzzles, to be honest. How to find a path to climb the tower basically. There is a decent variety of puzzles though, which is fairly great and nothing is too challanging that it will make you quit, but not easy enough that you can get them all on the first try.\n\nThe last thing I have to mention is the concept. A girl who climbs a tower while aging in the process. It is quite interesting and I would have liked to see it done in a longer game over the course of a longer time. You get basically 4 ages: infant, child, teenager, and adult. The first two go by really fast, however.\n\nI'll go ahead and sum things up with some pros/cons.\n\nPros:\nUnique concept - Character aging throughout the game.\nFemale Main Character\nBeautiful Graphics\nDifferent Non-repetative Puzzles\nStory is interesting, but given the shortness of the game feels a bit rushed.\nCons:\nCombat is really lack luster.\nIt is a shorter game (this might be a pro for some people)\nOccasional graphic errors (nothing game breaking though)\nYou don't really connect with the character at all. She has almost no personality and little to no character development.\nOn a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 6/10. I would love to rate it higher, but the combat wasn't the best, when there was any and there were many noticable graphic glitches.","July 16, 2015","true","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Maybe the story.\nThe girl doesn't speak at all (and I read somewhere that the "dialogs" feel like Shadow of the Colossus, and I agree), but the story is told in parts, building itself through the levels. And it's actually good.\nAs a "kind-of" religious person myself, the analogy with Babel's tower (and the description in each trading card, you should read them!) pleases me a little.\nAnd as a brazilian, to see a game created here to be this good and be published at Steam is truly satisfying. I hope one day I'll create a game with such care and small details.\n\nThe game is very short (really short), but at least it's a start. I'd like to see more levels, a tad slower character growing...\n\nBut anyways, congratulations to the team.","May 13, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

That said, I've been longing to play this game for about 2 or 3 years.\n\nFor some people that don't know the story of the development, or even how the industry is going in this country, it can be easy to bash on the small bugs and defects, and deem the game as a low quality small game that could be on mobiles on something like that - but let's be rational, this game is incredible!\n\nKeeping things short, why you should buy this game:\n\n+ It has great atmosphere, brought by nice graphics and level design, amazing soundtrack, and a story full of symbolism and philosophical references. At times, it reminded me of games like Dark Souls (for the architectures and somber scenes), and Shadow of Colossus.\n+ The gameplay is simple, yet fluid and smooth. The game may have some clunky camera and controls, but you get used to it very early in the game.\n+ It plays quickly, reminding the style of Journey, for it feels better to go through the entire game in one playthrough, as if seeing a film.\n\nWhy you may not want to play this game:\n\n- It is very short and without many factors that would increase replayability.\n- It is a simple game in terms of mechanics, don't expect much beyond some puzzles, exploration, and a boss battle every now and then.\n- Sometimes you have to kill animals.","May 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The visuals are great and the gameplay is not terribly bad. Keyboard controls can be classified as bad and I can imagine that even controllers can have issues with the automated camera, but there is a lot of room for errors so you can let it slide. The puzzles are childishly easy but even if you fail, the checkpoints are plenty.\n\nThe major flaw is the story though. The trailer and the description here on Steam explain more than what the game does which I found to be a huge flaw. There is an interesting story to be told somewhere in there, but your interest might have died even before the intro ends.\n\nHow can your interest die from just the intro though? Well, the quality is terrible in the opening of the game. It felt rushed and had some terrible animation sequences and straight up boring narration. It gets better soon enough after that, but for such a sort game I would have expected better overall quality for that price tag.\n\nBut still, it wasn't the worst thing ever.

I don't expect to for quite some time, either. It's quite the experience.\n\nToren's story, atmosphere and music are stellar and I wish more games could take the approach that it does to weaving its narrative. Hinting at what's really going on with the world while leading the player to find out, it did a great job of hooking me into the story. The graphics, while not super hi-def, are very, very pretty. And the MUSIC, dear god. (If you're going to buy this game, do yourself a favor and get the soundtrack too, ESPECIALLY if you like strings.) All elements of the game's presentation work together to create a world that's captivating. I think my favorite part were the dream sequences, each of which had its own feel.\n\nThe game, while I enjoyed it, is far from perfect. The controls are pretty janky, and if you want to play the game without wanting to stab yourself in the face it's probably in your best interest to get a controller. I also encountered a lot of glitches while playing. (The most memorable one of these was when I picked up my sword right before getting killed by the dragon, and then every time I tried to use it thereafter it flew off into the air somewhere and you could see it wiggling around in the air while I apparently tried to punch the dragon to death.

This, apparently. Toren is a short little platformer that clearly favours style but manages to get a decent portion of substance in with it. You play as a girl running, jumping and stabbing her way through multiple lifetimes in pursuit of a particularly satanic dragon, in the hopes that doing so will make end the endless day scorching the world into a lifeless husk stop.\n\nThe first thing you will notice is that the graphics aren't pretty, in fact in some places they're downright ugly. Only some, though. I've always felt that atmosphere and a coherent style are better than bland hyperrealism, and for the most part the art direction makes up for the flat textures and uncanny-valley faces. There are some cutscenes in a sort of painted style that were freaking lovely though, and it's a shame there weren't a few more. The controls could be tighter, sometimes feeling like momentum is building from nothing, but only once did I die as a direct result of them. Still, for a platformer, they're serviceable at best. For the obvious lack of budget, I only found one actual glitch, involving clipping through the floor in a very specific spot after some very panicky swordplay. People have reported achievements not showing until after you exit the game, but the devs have confirmed this was intentional, so as not to break immersion.\n\nI did have a good time with this. There are some very gorgeous-looking parts and the story leaves enough mystery and room for interpretation while still having clear goals and narrative. I loved the reincarnating, it's that rarest of things in "artsy" videogames: a good idea actually executed well. It's all held together with gameplay that's compelling enough to keep you moving forward. It won't be for everyone; the length in particular I imagine will be a sticking point for some people and if that sounds like you I'd wait for a sale. But it's a nice little thing put together with love and technical competance, and that's all I really want at the end of the day.","February 17","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since then more and more similar titles have come and continued the style, imitated the style, and even done it better. Brazilian studio developer Swordtales clearly aim to create 2015’s “ICO” with Toren, and while the heart, style, and intentions are there and righteous, the soul lacks just enough to prevent it from being an instant classic.\n\nCasted in the role of Moonchild, you must ascend the mysterious tower you bore in as a newborn to slay the menacing dragon claiming ownership of the stronghold. A cyclical theme, Moonchild must continuously be reborn as the narrative necessitates. As you plant the seed for the Tree of Life by the wishes of your master, The Magician, various puzzles are required to be solved to prevail and help the tree grow along with yourself. Light on religious allegory, but playing a common role with the Tree of Life, the religious ideals of Kabbalah (wisdom that reveals how the universe and life work) help the player associate Moonchild’s goals of understanding and receiving the benefits of what one puts into the world.\n\n\nToren will not take much of your time, and it can be completed in an average of 3 hours, but like other games of this pedigree, it’s not the destination; it’s the journey and underlying message(s) found within. The density of Toren as to something like ICO might be more apparent as one plays, and it may not be as satisfying either; but as the credits roll you will have experienced something that’s not doing being done more often in the industry. Swordtales is presents a story that whisks you away to a world wherein your role is greater than you’d ever expect; something that is your destiny and is cryptically exposed as you climb the tower. The Magician likes to invade your dreams and never outright tell you your goal, but will acknowledge your strengths, push you forward, and ensure your objective is attained.\n\nToren, Swordtales, Versus Evil, Indie Games, Indie Gaming, Steam, PC, PS4, PSN, ICO,\n\nSimplicity can be exceptional, even often times preferred, yet simplicity should still hold a message worth replaying or wanting to share almost immediately. Gone Home was a game many were eager to rush to forums and friends to discuss and learn of varying playthroughs. It was simplistic if you wished to get through, but also a depth that could be found and learned should you want to do that too. Very few playthroughs were ever quite the same, but Toren’s players will always tell the same tale no matter the decisions and exploration; Moonchild’s fate is already determined and cyclical no matter the player’s attempts. That’s completely subjective of course, and for one who like to ogle absolutely stunning graphics and treat their ears to majestically serene compositions, Toren grants that. Sweeping strings accompany dramatic scenes while somber songs flourish in discovering all the tower offers.\n\nToren, Swordtales, Versus Evil, Indie Games, Indie Gaming, Steam, PC, PS4, PSN, ICO,\n\nIf you’re in the mood for a puzzle-platformer offering a story that satisfies but lacks an endearing finale, Toren certainly fills that hole. We will still talk of Toren come year’s end, and it will be played throughout the year, but we fear of the missed opportunity with Toren to create a bit more of a compelling narrative will hold it back from being a truly remarkable gameplay experience. Visually and audibly Toren is one of the strongest games of the summer, just not enough gameplay to make it a must own. Now, should you play it?\n\nYES\n\n+ Borrows heavily from the puzzle-platforming niche few games fulfill\n\n+ Thought provoking\n\n+ Terrific ambient and sweeping music serenading drop-dead gorgeous graphics\n\n- Better games have done more in similar structures\n\n- Will be a game we talk about by year’s end, but likely not further\n\n(Review via Front Towards Gamre: http://ftg.operationsupplydrop.org/2015/05/21/toren-review-pc/)","May 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Alas, even the invisible ball-and-chain wrapped around Toren's ankle doesn't provide much for gameplay like many other story-based platformers.

The graphics fit well with the artistic expression of the game, despite not being the highest quality. The sound, story, and concepts are esoteric, and require patience more than skill or knowledge to complete. As the movements of the character feel sluggish, and the platforming of the game can best be described as guided.\n\nThe game is balanced off of learning by failure, rather than learning by testing the limits of your environment. You almost need to fail most of the time in order to move forward. They have integrated a very thorough checkpoint system, however, so you do not lose much progress when you die. For me, I did die very often and have to reload more times than I enjoy.\n\nThe environment is abstract, leaving you with more questions than answers, and leaves you confused more than not. The ending does wrap up the story nicely, but when I think about my time in the game, it didn't draw me in enough to want to know more. This made my progression through the story very grating.\n\nThe art style was beautiful, the gameplay was a bit clunky, and the story was unclear and confusing until the end. The game relies very heavily on patience to make it through the puzzles and challenges, and you have to be okay with multiple reloads as you progress in order to enjoy it. I would say this would be worth getting if it was on a decent sale. It works, but just barely, and designed to slow the player down as much as possible. A very high level of patients is needed.\n\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","December 6, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

All that put together by a small indie team from Brazil, go, giving their chance.\n\nWhat a disappointment, and this from the first minutes of the game :\n\nA catchy story like a teacher of physics !\nIt's ugly, really ugly...\nSome action... slow, tooooo slow !\nAn enjoyable and precise handling like the time when i played at the Super Nintendo !\nSets are all the same, even if you see some aquatic animals and you understand that you are at the bottom of the ocean...\nA fixed camera that gives the frustration of not being able to enjoy all the scenery but allow at least to have his character stuck between each brick of wall...\n\nBut hey, we do not forget that it is a small studio, let their still a chance !\nAnd at that time, came the fall. We wake up under the encouragement of "The Mage" and is pleased to see that the respawn is a place visited there almost 15 minutes before !!!\nAfter the third death, I thought to activate a cheat to let myself be lulled by the story and know the final word, but I realized it was 4 hours since i launch the game and I was bored of this story as flat as my character...\n\nI can hardly believe I'm saying this, but for me, Toren is one of those rare games that I'll let disappear in the bottom of my collection of Steam games...\n\nFrancçais\nD'habitude, je suis plutôt conciliante avec les défaults d'un jeu et j'arrive à facilement balancer avec les points positifs que m'apporte un jeu.\nAvec Toren, je n'ai pas réussi ce challenge...\nEt pourtant, c'était bien partie : Lors de la pré-vente, j'ai directement accrochée au style graphique du jeu présenté en image et il me semblait que l'histoire me tiendrait en haleine tout au long de l'ascencion de la tour ! Tout ca concocter par une petite équipe indé venu du Brésil, allez, donnons leurs leur chance.\n\nQuel déception, et ce, dès les premières minutes de jeu :\n\nUne histoire aussi accrocheuse qu'un prof de physique !\nC'est moche, vraiment moche...\nDe l'action... lente, trèèèèèès lente !\nUne maniabilitée aussi agréable et précise qu'à l'époque ou je jouais à la Super Nintendo !\nDes décors qui se ressemblent et ce, même si à la vue d'animaux aquatique, on comprends qu'on est au fond de l'océan...\nUne caméra fixe qui donne la frustration de ne pas pouvoir profiter de l'entiereté des décors mais qui permets au moins d'avoir son personnage coincé entre chaque brique du décors...\n\nMais bon, on n'oublie pas que c'est un petit studio, laissons leurs encore une chance !\nEt à ce moment là, arrive la chute. On ce réveille sous les encouragement du "Mage" et on a le plaisir de constater que le point de respawn est un endroit visité il y a près de 15 min !!!\n\nAu bout de la troisième mort, j'ai pensée à activer un cheat pour me laisser bercer par l'histoire et connaitre le fin mot mais j'ai réalisée que ça faisait 4 heures que je m'ennuyais de cette histoire aussi plate que mon personnage...\n\nJ'ai du mal à croire que je dis ça, mais pour moi, Toren fait partie de ces rares jeux que je vais laisser disparaitre dans le fond de ma collection de jeux Steam...\n\n","September 25, 2015","false","4.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","2"

Most likely something to do with human pride, but from what I can tell, pride is what beat the dragon, so I don't really know.\n\nThe graphics are subpar, but forgiveable with decent gameplay... However, this did not have decent gameplay.\nThe camera is always facing in the direction that you're supposed to proceed, severely limiting any adventure or exploration aspects. This goes directly against the achievements which require exploration and adventure.\nThere was almost no combat, and no consequence for death. (Unless you count hearing jibberish meant to sound wise as a punishment) There is also a part where your death is required to get past it.\n\nThe controls were unintuitive, and I found myself trying to figure out what it wanted me to do, rather than just knowing what to do. The action events would often change from rotating the joystick to pulling in one direction or the other without any guidance.\n\nThe cutscenes were too seemless at times, with me standing there staring at the screen, not realising it was my turn to take over.\n\nI did finish the game, and I'm glad I bought it on sale. I would not be happy if I had spent $10 on this.\n\nI hope that the developers create another game.

Clipping, collision detection, floaty platforming, what little of the combat there is lacks much feedback. But I feel the lack of polish is excused considering like 30 people in total worked on the game (including composer, producers) and with the variety of visuals on offer here. On the level of Zeno Clash 2. Much like that game, also South American developers (Swordtales is Brazilian, ACE Team is Chilean) so props to seeing more games from that continent.\n\nIf those don't bother you so much, check it out for a really interesting coming-of-age dark fantasy experience. It's short but complete, around 3 hours. Perfect for one sitting. There is oodles of poeticism and surrealism involving ashen children, blood, seasons, and celestial bodies. Basically, men's ambition and arrogance has failed them, so a girl is the only one who can save it all while being guided by a mage, but her childhood will have to be sacrificed. Seasons and her age changes, as she makes a tree tower to the top. Celestial bodies get involved. Reminded me fondly of Tale of Princess Kaguya. There's only about 3 characters involved: a girl, a soldier, and a dragon. It's a pretty grim and lonely affair when you realise it's a post-human world, overall.\n\nThe music by Vinicius Kleinsorgen is memorably excellent.\n\nIf you're up for something more sombre from an action-adventure game in the vein of Team Ico with the dark surrealism of something like Alice Madness Returns, 70s psychedelia, and a cool female protagonist in a memorable tale, give it a shot. Worth it just for the visuals.","November 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The really pretty art style (marred by the awkward animations) and the ico-esque atmosphere more than make up for the shortcomings of the game... if it is on sale. $10.00 is asking a lot for most people when the game is this barebones and at most 2 hours long.\n\nIf you enjoy Team Ico style games then you'll definitely enjoy this, but if you're looking for good puzzles or gameplay elements look elsewhere.

It's also never very clear what's going on or what you're supposed to be doing, so i spent even more time just wondering around.\n\nThe major problem i had was the "dreams" being optional though. I'm willing to forgive a game a lot of sins if it has good aesthetic and a great story. I think this could have both of them, but i spent the entire game going "Huh? Who's that dude? What's going on here?" because i missed the very first optional dream, as they weren't explained, and later in the game that particular dream statue is unuseable. Each dream gives you part of the back story, and without it, you miss a huge chunk of plot, so i was annoyed by how easy they were to not see, and by the fact that the first one at least isn't compulsory.\n\nMissing a dream also means you actually miss out on a hefty amount of gameplay; it's a short game, and each dream is a few mins of new content, so they're sort of screwing themselves by making them optional as well.\n\nOverall i found that the music was nice, the palatte was pretty and there's  a lot of potential here, but really, unless you've totally run out of something to play, i would probably give this one a miss.","December 6, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You just don't know.\n\nAbout the point I realized that I was going to drop my sword REPEATEDLY in EACH battle and have to find it WHILE DODGING DRAGONFIRE, crippled by the control scheme and the camera, I gave up. Pity. It seemed like an interesting (if cryptic) story, and I wanted to see how it came out. Maybe I'll go look up a synopsis somewhere.\n\nThis could be a fairly good adventure/story game. Its platformer aspects are bearable. But the sort of combat sequences they've put in here to pad out the play time simply don't work, especially when after every death you have to endure a cutscene of Platitudes From The Old Dead Guy - just long enough that pressing Space to skip it doesn't really help - then two minutes of running/climbing back to where you died. Over and over.\n\nI'm willing to gamble on a ten-buck game fairly often. This one wasn't worth that.","August 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Someone in a video I saw compared it to Ori and the Blind Forest--don't go into it with that idea.\n\nA lot of the scenes and transitions between when you can do something and when you can't are slow, even painfully drawn out. The combat is limited, and fights against the boss--while not quite like anything I've seen before and while they introduce an element of teamwork with the AI--are repetitive and more about solving puzzles and waiting between boss attacks, so I found them boring overall. There is some reading, although not as much as other story games. Considering how crappy a lot of storybook games are with their paragraphs of reading before you can do anything and find an object 2D styles, it is very good graphically and thought out. A few minor glitches here and there, but for the most part, sound bug-wise. Oh, the credits don't let you skip and just when they seem like they will end, more come; I'd recommend just cutting the game at that point unless you enjoy final cut-scenes. t's also relatively short. I think someone not out to explore despite the game's linear nature could finish it in a few hours.\n\nI guess if you're into story games or you're 10 and enjoy pouring sand in shapes in a game, it's fine, but it moved too slowly for me, so I felt bored a lot of the time. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends, who prefer more combat-style games.","October 3, 2015","false","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's a certain charm to be found in games like this that don't exist anywhere else. Charm that exists in the game's stunning environmental visuals, and soundtrack. Games like Ico, or Shadow of the Colossus seems to have had some sort of impact on how this game came into fruition, and because of that I can say I'd rather live in a world where this game was made, than not.\n\nWith that out of the way, I need to address some issues I have with the game overall. While the visuals are beautiful, character models seem to have not had the same attention to detail put into them as everything else. Character animations feel rough, as do the cutscenes, and a lot of the time, the main character had an expression on her face that I can only describe as goofy. Also, the way the story is presented could have used some work as well. There's seems to be a lot of interesting lore hidden throughout the world to better explain everything for those willing to dig deeper, but I myself couldn't really find anything to latch onto, and that's due in part to the shortness of the game.\n\nConcepts for puzzle solving are introduced through tutorial segments, but are rarely ever used again, and that's a shame because there were plenty of opportunities for them to branch out beyond what the game had. Combat felt sluggish, hitting enemies never felt that satisfying, and platforming felt really floaty. Sound effects could have also used some more work, since I got tired of hearing that dragon's screech consistantly.\n\nDespite all this though, I still found the game worth buying at a sale price. There was a lot here that I really enjoyed, and despite my minor gripe about the length of the game, the hidden backstory does encorage multiple playthroughs, that wouldn't be a chore to go through due to the length of the game. I don't hate this game at all, and I do highly recommend checking it out. It's one of the better indie games I've played this year, and I'd love to see this company go and make something else to showcase their talent even further. But for 10 dollars, I'd suggest waiting for some sort of price drop like I did.","December 1, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I gave it the benefit of the doubt though, and thought that maybe if I continued it would surprise me...It did not to say the least :(.\n\nIf you're looking for a good story with a plot that keeps you in suspense, do not buy this game. You will not enjoy it.\nHowever if you are just looking for some great artwork and music to experience then this game should suit your tastes.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add one more thing. The trailer is 10x more interesting than the game. Basically the trailer is so well edited and voiced that if it was made to advertise paint drying instead it would have me sold.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BriHard/recommended/320820/","BriHard","BriHard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BriHard/","263 products in account","Y’see, while Toren does its best to be visually appealing that’s all it really accels at. While yes the textures and poly distribution could use work it’s really the only highlight of the game. Had the team had better artists it could look better, but my main problem is the actual game itself.\nWhile Toren will cost you around $10 it doesn’t really feel worth it because of how the game is structured as it’s only about and hour and a half long. With a game like Ico it’s $10 and the game can last around 7 hours. Journey is $15 and is 3 hours and honestly I feel like it’s worth more than 4x the amount because that’s how good it was. Toren feels more or less like it wants to be Ico in today’s new gaming world and it fails miserably at it.\nOne thing the game was supposed to feature was playing as the main character from her infancy to her adulthood. This might’ve been a misinterpretation of the game on my part, but it feels like it’s there for the sake of simply being a cool marketing feature. Within 30 seconds of getting control of your main character you’re practically shoved into being a teenager or at least a young adult via a time skip.\nI feel like I either misinterpreted this part of the game or they purposely misled us. It feels more or less like the game expected players to take in the environment or be incredibly stupid and die a lot as the game is only an hour and a half. It feels like maybe the dev wanted it to be longer, but realized quickly the game was too short, therefore it tried to make certain areas just a bit harder.\nThere are some interesting moments, but they’re all pretty meh when compared to other games. When my friend saw what I was playing he claimed I was playing the final boss of Ico. The only boss in the game acts just like Ico’s final boss. He’ll shoot you with a wave of darkness or gusts of wind that kill your or send you back and your sword is the only thing to protect when you’re not near the blocks that you have to push around to reach your sword unharmed and when you land a hit they just knock your sword back again.\nIt feels like the whole game took its game design from Ico and just shoved it into two hours. See Toren tries to be art and you can’t be art for the sake of art. When a game does this it’s going to run into a lot of problems. It tries to entice you with its concept and art, but the music, or lackthereof, and gameplay just make the experience a dull little trek through typical modern indie game. There is a cool concept, such as dying when you’re turned to stone in order to use your previous incarnation’s husk as a shield or to progress through the level, but it only happens once during gameplay and the 2nd time it’s scripted.\nThe game barely has any puzzles too. What it does have are lines that you walk alone while spilling dirt and those are counted as puzzles. Not since the puzzles of Kirby have I had such an easy time with a game. Trying to fit a ball into a circular hole is harder than this! It’s all pretty pathetic.\nIt seems like the devs thought they had a hit on their hands and according to the Steam reviews they probably do. Yes, games can be short. ♥♥♥♥ing How Do You do It? proves that without a doubt, but at least that game was enjoyable. If you’re going to make a 2 hour game and charge me $10 I should feel like I got my money’s worth and less like a dev said “Sorry you’re so stupid for buying this game. Now bend over so I can ♥♥♥♥ you in your ♥♥♥♥.”\nThinking back to it there’s a really good Xbox Live Indie Game that shows off what it’s like to make a good game, charge a low price, and still have me feel like I got my money’s worth. It’s called I Made A Game With Zombies In It. Throughout the whole game you’re treated to a twinstick shooter while a hilarious song plays in the background. By the end of the 30 minute game, which develops from a game about zombie survival to a game about an acid trip with cats, you sit back and smile thinking to yourself “That was worth the whole ♥♥♥♥ing dollar I paid for it.” And I returned to it multiple times after to continue playing it because even without the song it was just that ♥♥♥♥ing good.\nToren made me feel gipped. There’s no replay value, but just to be sure I didn’t somehow skip 80% of the game I played through it again. I missed one or two things that padded on an extra 15 minutes, but even with the two hour playtime I still feel like I’ve been violated worse than your typical SJW when they complain that someone doesn’t agree with them.\nBetter yet, the character’s slow animations and movement speed feel like they’re done deliberately to make the game artificially harder, but honestly it’s still pretty easy. The game only has two enemies and one of them can’t even kill your, and if they can I’m pretty sure the game just didn’t realize it could.\nThe game even pulls a ♥♥♥♥ing Dark Souls II and says the cycle of the game’s story will constantly repeat so you might as fuggin’ well start a new file.\nSo is Toren worth your $10? ♥♥♥♥ no. Wait for it to go on sale if anything or if you have a friend with the game and pity them play it there so your friend feels like maybe they got their money’s worth. Or you could just wait for the game to be free on PS+. It doesn’t matter, even when it’s free you’re still going to feel ripped off.","May 14, 2015","false","3.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Recommend it as a "work of art" as an artist myself. Not as a game, as a gamer myself.\n\nI don't think controller or not would make too much of a difference - it didn't detect my XbOne controller (with driver that lets windows use it as a 360 controller, it works fine in other games) - but did detect my logitech f310, I played with that;\n\nBut anyway the gameplay is clunky, single button gameplay. There's hardly any action, and when there is, the hitboxes are awkward - they're also awkward for jumping and interacting. This is a piece of 3d art made to showcase some people/group of people's skills for a portfolio or something - the story doesn't bother with any concrete explanations so rather than good or bad I'd just say the story was non-existent and the game was rather just a visual feast. Like sitting in a theatre watching a professional dance or something. It's 2 hours long, but I guess it's meant to be quality over quantity? I don't know, as a gamer, I don't understand any of this thing. Why it was made, or who it was made to please. Reviewers and business execs to get venture capital or something? Showcasing of 3d techniques to sell software to other designers behind the scenes? The problem is that games exist in the context of other games. In a vacuum, this thing might be meaningful.\n\nBeautiful, but pretty boring. As an artist I enjoyed it, I really appreciated the intuitive design elements in the puzzles, and I suppose I'm glad that things like this are being made, but as a gamer, I could've done without playing it. Estimated value relative to other steam pricing: $3, generously. Also, because of the nature of graphical advancement, this game won't age well, either.","June 2","false","2.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is a walking simulator with pretty colors. The thing claiming to be a story is barely comprehensible, and the dream sequences are unnecessary and tiresome. The camera doesn't move enough, except for when it moves far too much. Apparently I'm the only person on Steam who has this opinion, but I don't think the graphics are very good.\n\nYou're going to beat the game in under two hours. You're going to wonder if you missed something. You're going to realize that you didn't miss anything. You're going to wonder why you spent ten dollars on two hours of mediocrity.

There weren't any puzzles in the beginning part, which was all I was able to get through before becoming enraged due to massive amounts of cutscenes. It says that you play through the game as your character ages but the toddler stage lasted maybe 2 minutes. No joke. The only thing you do as a toddler is move around a room to touch a sword. No exploring, toddler level puzzles, creative gameplay elements, nothing. Just touch a sword and boom, you're a child. The childhood stage was about 5-6 minutes after that. I expected more gameplay during each stage of her life.\n\nWish I could get a refund but I bought it off of humble bundle...oh well.

I could even say its feels spiritual in its approach to gripping you. Its a story that feels like it could be interperted in many differnt ways, (coming of age, growing up, fighting your fears, marriage, etc).\n\nThis game also isn't the sword fighting experience you would get with zelda (like I thought). The sword feels more like a tool to complete the puzzle, than the fight blade to get rid of you enemys. It does do that, but it slowly starts to lose its importance to the player beside completing a goal. I wish some of the mechanics of the game where much more polished, like swordplay and interactions enemys. The puzzles aren't difficult in anyway but they were memorable by meaning. Everything about this game drives the story as its main offering to the player and it does it well.\n\nThe best part of this game has got to be the music, its just perfect in terms of mood. Combined with the great environments really gives you that adventure in the sky feel.\n\nPros:\nInteresting story\nBeautiful music (Get the sound track)\nGreat atmosphere\nMemorable puzzles\n\nCons:\nShort\nBad Cam\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 5, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe that they were restrained by time and budget as I believe it was more of a project that grew into something they could sell as it went along. Despite this, it is still heartfelt and rich with symbolism and the artstyle, albeit different than what you are used to seeing a multimillion dollar project still allows moments of beauty and atmosphere. I would recommend picking it up on sale if you are a saavy consumer, however, if you are of a higher mindset and wish to support the indie developers, likely still in or just out of college, then this title is a great purchase. Be aware, that the playtime will be short, clocking in about 3 hours or less and is mostly for the story and atmosphere with some splashes of puzzles, strategy, platforming and action moments thoughout.

From what I gathered of the story: Wizard builds tall tower, sun gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and turns it into eternal day, wizard turns moon into a child with infinite lives, for some reason this involves killing a dragon that turns things to stone, moonchild grows like a weed, kills dragon with some soldier guy, moonrises, game done.\n\nTL;DR: It's has almost no gameplay, if you're interested in the story watch someone play it on youtube.","January 7","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But honestly it was a struggle to get through for me. There isn't much gameplay at all, it's got a hint of puzzle solving with almost no combat to speak of. The game itself seemed like it was trying to be deep but fell short and just throws poetic nonsense at you. From what I gathered of the story: Wizard builds tall tower, sun gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and turns it into eternal day, wizard turns moon into a child with infinite lives, for some reason this involves killing a dragon that turns things to stone, moonchild grows like a weed, kills dragon with some soldier guy, moonrises, game done.\n\nTL;DR: It's has almost no gameplay, if you're interested in the story watch someone play it on youtube.","January 7","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only thing I can compare it to is ICO. I got the same feeling at the start of ICO as i had at the early part and throughout Toren. ICO is a much more posilished game but i'm focused on the feelings I had while playing and after. The gameplay is good but nothing special. The visuals do the game justice but again are nothing to write home about. This game just makes you want to play to the end, and it was worth playing through. The controls were not great and sometimes frustrating. The soundtrack was ok as well. I know this is a by the numbers review but if you like a good story and are ok with it ending quick this is completely worth a look!","March 21","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't try to be much deeper than it is while still leaving some thinking up to player. Now there are some issues with the platforming as the terrain can be a little buggy as you can clip with some objects and animations get jumbled up. This doesn't happen very often and chances are it won't happen more than once for a given area. There are a few areas that can be a little frustrating when fighting a specific enemy however this is only if you're pushing a given timeframe.\n\nThe art and enviornment really are fantastic as you do feel immersed in your adventure as you climb the tower. However how great things look drawbacks are that some models seem slightly out of place as well as the character not being full textured under the clothing so you can see inside the model. The music is fitting of the mood and adds plenty of character and flavor as you make your way up the tower.\n\nDespite severely lacking a loving polish, this game does give a good experience for the time you spend with it.\n\n-------\n\nTo experience the entirety of the game it will only take you about two hours and you can pickup every achievement on the way there as well.","May 19","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I feel there is a lot of intention and purpose in changing the controls to fit the themes of the chapter you're on. This is a sacrilidge to anyone who things genres are king and any game without perfectly fluid controls is broken and I won't change anyone's mind there. Your character changes over and over and the game grows along with her. She can feel young and weak, or spry, or tired. You feel the growth as you slowly understand how she fits into the world.\n\nCombat is bare but intentional, platforming has tension and failure has reason. My advice is play the game at it's own pace rather than expected it to be something it's not. It has it's own rhythm and rituals. It evokes Zelda and Ico but doesn't play like them.\n\nI appreciated how visual everything is. There's text but it's poetic and reflective rather and obvious like most other games I've played. The world you end up in are shocking and symbolic without being overdone, very memorable. You can see the limits of the tech and budget but in general they don't affect the overwhelming moods of each area.\n\nIf you want a small game with huge beauty, mystery, a plot to reflect on, don't wait for a sale. You should give this game a second look and play it.","May 20","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
