Well, actually the puzzles aren't too difficult, because solutions came out by themself when you play and it's kinda good. Each marble have its own ability, rubber can jump, paper can shrink and metal can boost. All of them have to reach finish line to complete level. Controls are more "sticky" ones, so there are no acceleration at all after releasing directional button. Cartoonish graphic style included.","May 29, 2015","true","2.3"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","55","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctormozg/recommended/291430/","doctormozg","DoctorMozG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctormozg/","951 products in account","Lost Marbles concept is pretty straightforward: control and guide marbles, from the beginning of a level to the end. There are three types of marbles you will control. First, a rubber marble that can jump, swim in water and survive electrical damage. Second, a paper marble that can change its size to fit into smaller spaces and moved away on wind. Third, a metal marble that can be affected by magnets, ignore damage from fire and spikes, and accelerate forward to break through barriers. All of the marbles must reach the end of any given level in order for the stage to be completed. The puzzles require coordination and straight up puzzle solving. The controls are incredibly simple: roll your ball with the WASD keys, and change your camera angle by moving the mouse. Beyond this, a hardcore mode is available, tasking you with having to complete the levels perfectly in a raw, while failures sending you back to the beginning of the previous level. Which can be very disappointing and annoying, but fun in some wicked sense of humor way. Lost Marbles is a solid, decently polished game that delivers some well crafted challenge. If you are on the hunt for a new puzzle game to challenge you, this one is at least worth a look. Overall, the game was pleasant, refreshing and frustrating.","January 13, 2015","true","21.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Lost Marbles, proves to be an example of that.\n\nWhat I found most enticing about this game was the amount of collaborative effort between the three individual marbles, and how they work together to help reach the exit. Nearly all of the levels feature unique elements, and the developers did a great job making sure none of the marbles had a clear path to the exit without needing to contribute anything to to the map. They also did a great job making the 3 marbles unique from each other; you can definitely feel and notice the weight and speed difference between them.\n\nWhile I found tons of enjoyment out of the game as a whole, there are still a couple things I personally had a little less fun with, one being the par times, which while I definitely know were fixed recently, still prove to be frustrating to beat later on. The only way I can describe the way the par times feel (at least only in the later half of the game) is that I have to speed run recklessly through the level with no room for hesitation. Thankfully the par times aren't required to beat in order to progress so I see it more of an optional thing to challenge myself with later on. The only other thing that bothered me were the graphics of the Menu GUI. As a graphic designer I find the use of the white and black drop shadows on the windows to be a bit awkward, and the 1 pixel stroke around the lettering is definitely not very appealing to the eye, but again that is just a very minor qualm that doesn't really affect the overall game too much.\n\nRegardless of the menu graphics though, I found the game environment to be quite enticing. In spite of the unusual thick outlining around all of the objects, I felt that worked to the games favor because you can very clearly see what you can interact with without it detracting from anything. I also liked the attention to detail with the sound effects, especially that each marble has a different rolling sound.\n\nOverall I found this game to be very enjoyable; I'm happy to have assisted with the developer in pushing a new update to enhance the gameplay, and the fixes he did very much show a noticeable improvement from the last big update.","July 10, 2015","true","17.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you expect something with the quality of "Ballance" (the one by Atari) or Hamsterball, you will be disappointed. In it's own way it's kinda nice. Having three balls with different abilities is kind interesting, but: The marbles just feel odd, mainly because there isn't much in terms of inertia - they halt almost instantly and that just feels unnatural if you've played (for example) the other two I've listed above, they also all feel the same. Here and there I miss some checkpoint and it just feels a bit amateurish. I'll play it and kinda enjoy it on the basis that there is a lack of alternatives, but I can't really recommend it either. If you feel adventurous and if you are a die-hard fan of that kind of games then you may still wanna give it a try. Also: Use mouse and keyboard - just doesn't work that nice with a controller.","August 25, 2014","false","1.2"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"
