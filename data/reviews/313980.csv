Turns out, after giving it a second chance, it somehow clicked and I actually enjoyed myself.\n\nBasically this is a hack'n'slay that I would say is more on the defensive side of things, with combat leaning towards a hit and run style - not unlike, say, Ninja Gaiden. However, It is much more limited in scope and mobility. I do believe these limitations make it a success - because as soon as you figured out how to counter each enemy and got the timing for dashing away down you will be zig-zagging all across the arenas with boosters on full power and dispatching some nasty scrapheads. You can't really mash away at enemies though, each type must be carefully observed - but once figured out only excellent execution on your end stands between victory or defat. It may look a lot worse than Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae - but the short length, and the rather interesting enemy groups you encounter make it a lot more fun to learn and master. Basically, each stage introduces a new enemy type that you at first face alone, only to later encounter them in a group of various types giving battles different dynamics as you will have to adjust your gameplan accordingly. It's all rather compact and simple, but I found that actually quite engaging and entertaining.\n\nThe game got a few issues though, I fell through some areas in every single playthrough and the camera isn't always on point either. Especially when locking on to a single enemy, the camera makes sure it is a death sentence for groupfights.\n\nNot exactly GOTY material, and pretty rough in places - it was actually engaging the moment it "clicked". Overcoming impossible odds with ease (once you gotten the hang of it) never gets old and this game delivers exactly that. No more, no less.","December 18, 2014","true","3.8"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","30","37","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thraeg/recommended/313980/","Thraeg","Thraeg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thraeg/","979 products in account","This was a game I had heard nothing about but took a random flyer on it during the recent Steam sale because it looked interesting and was only $1, and it's been a very pleasant surprise. Created by a lone developer, it's stripped down to focus solely on the combat -- a couple paragraphs of story, simple but functional graphics reminiscent of an uprezzed Unreal, no need to unlock moves, no bloated combo lists, no puzzles to solve, no RPG elements, just room after room of different configurations of evil robots to hack to bits.\n\nFortunately, the combat system stands up to the weight placed on it. You play some sort of robotic samurai, and can use a mix of standard melee slashes, special moves that work well against unshielded enemies, and powered attacks that cut through shields better but drain an energy meter that you also need to use for rocket dashes. The rocket dashes are one of two main defensive options -- they give you a lot of speed and maneuverability, but no invincibility frames so you have to make sure you actually get clear of whatever's attacking you. The other defense is a parry that blocks any melee attack and chains into an EMP blast retaliation that breaks shields and stuns the attacker, but a missed parry leaves you stationary and vulnerable. There's no scoring system, but effective play has a nice satisfying flow to it, and using all the available tools to pick apart varied groups of enemies is quite fun. It's especially nice to feel yourself getting better at the game when a particular encounter has killed you a few times and you go back and wipe it out with ease (I probably had a dozen deaths on the final boss before going unscathed when I finally beat it).\n\nMy biggest complaint is the controls not being remappable -- they're functional for the most part, but have some odd choices that took a long time to get used to (lock-on on LT, parry on X, attack on Y). Besides that, some enemy configurations wind up a bit heavy on passively running in circles while waiting for an opening to go on the offensive.\n\nIt's a nice, tight 3 hours (for me at least, playing on normal and getting a few game overs during that time), and ends right when it's explored the combat system and before devolving into excessive repetition. A real steal at $1, a bit more of a gamble at the standard $5, but if it clicks for you it'll justify that price. If nothing else, I'd at least recommend putting it on a wishlist for the next sale or watching for it to show up in an indie bundle.","July 1, 2015","true","4.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huegh/recommended/313980/","huegh","dade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huegh/","264 products in account","In short, the things like the music and graphics are decent. The graphics are very simple, but you can tell what’s going on, and it has a rather charming style to it. The music is fitting and nice to listen to, but it’s nothing spectacular. The story is almost non existent, it’s a simple “Good Guy is on a quest to stop Evil Guy.” story. So due to the simplicity of the other features, I’ll focus this review on the gameplay itself.\n\nThe game is a hack ‘n slash, character action, spectacle fighter, whatever you wanna call it. The gameplay seems simple on paper, but it actually has a fair amount of depth to it. That doesn’t mean you should expect something as deep as say Devil May Cry, or even a simpler Metal Gear Rising. But for what it is, it’s a lot of fun when you get the hang of it.\n\nThe game controls as follows: (with a 360 controller)\n\nA - Use\nB - Special Stance\nY - Attack\nX - Guard\nLT - Lock On\nRT - Energy\n\nNow, these controls may seem a bit strange at first. That’s one part of the game that’s hard to get used to, using Y to attack and X to guard. Now, if you’re a fan of action games like these, you’re probably used to using X/SQUARE for attacking. NOPE, instead you get the awkward feel of the Y button. When I first began playing it, this was quite an obstacle for me. I frequently found myself guarding when I wanted to attack, or just missing the timing of some moves.\n\nSo now that that’s out of the way, I should take a moment to talk about the combat itself. When you approach an enemy, you have a set of options. You can use Y by itself to combo together 3 Basic Attacks, this combo is your bread & butter. You can use Y while holding down RT to combo together 3 Energy Attacks, which are slightly faster and do a little more damage, at the cost of depleting your energy bar. Or you can press B to enter a stance, which allows you to follow up by pressing Y to do a Heavy Attack. You can also follow up to that with B-Y-B-Y for the full combo of 3 Heavy Attacks. X gives you a basic Guard stance, when you are attacked in this state, you parry an enemies attack, and leave them open for an Ion Burst (I think that’s what it was called). This will temporarily stun your enemy, allowing you to do a sick nasty combo on them. Holding down RT by itself lets you boost around and go fast. It depletes your energy, though.\n\nAll of the attacks can be used together to form long strings of combos, and doing longer combos fills up your combo meter, which makes you do more damage or something. It works the same as Devil May Cry’s CUHRAZY meter does, filling up more or less depending on what attacks you are using and how much you’re using them.\n\nSo, now that the basic mechanics are out of the way, it’s time to talk about what makes it good and what makes it bad.\n\nThe game has a very Dark Souls-esque difficulty to it. It’s really hard. Whenever you die, you get that feeling of “Are you kidding me?” and then immediately continue playing, because most of the time it’s your fault for dying. But that brings us to the 'most of the time’ part. Whenever the game feels like it starts to have a good flow, and truly feels like what an action game of this genre should feel like, there’s always something to trip over. Whether it’s the control scheme, the awkward timing of the parrying, or some enemy hitting you in the back and stopping your combo and momentum.\n\nAll in all, it comes down to one thing. Is Proxy Blade Zero a good game? No.\n\nThe controls are clunky, the flow of the combat is interrupted frequently due to some poor balancing choices, and to top it all off, it has no graphical options due to it being a direct XBLA port. However the game can be fun if you’re willing to see it for what it’s worth; Which is a $2 indie game made by one dev team. (It’s $2 at the time of this review.)\n\nFinal Summation:\n\nPROS:\n\n+Catchy soundtrack\n+Stylish visuals\n+Interesting combat system\n+Fun/Unique bosses\n\nCONS:\n\n-No options\n-Awkward control scheme\n-Short gameplay\n-Sharp learning curve\n-Repetitive gameplay near the end\n\n5.5/10","February 16, 2015","true","5.3"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","25","32","2","0"

The combat feels good and pulling off a good string of attacks/dodges without being hit is challenging, yet fun. New enemy types have appeared frequently, enemy groups are nicely varied and it doesn't pull many cheap tricks either. Music is great, fits the tone of the gameplay very well and the visuals are done well too. It's not the most detailed look in the world but the animations are good, the robots look good and the lighting/attack effects have a bright, vivid design. If you think this game isn't worth $7 ($5.60 on sale) because of the way it looks then you're a baby, in a big budget cinematic game it's fine to expect top of the line visuals because the story and graphics have to make up for the linear, rote gameplay. This isn't one of those, it's a gameplay focused game. There's no filler, it's just you and the other robots trying to kill you. The only negative I can really think of is the length. Granted there is hard mode and the combat could warrant another playthrough so you'll definitely get your money's worth. Also there are too many pointless achievements (beat a mandatory level, kill 50 of X enemy, dodge 100 times etc).\n\nAddendum:\nI'm sort of disappointed in the amount of boss battles but it's nothing big, it's just that with how fun they were I would have loved to see more of them. Loved the voice acting and filters though, they fit perfectly, weren't too cheesy or trying to be funny and gave the bosses some personality. I'd personally buy a sequel or expansion with more stuff day one if that ever came about.\n\nLast edit:\nI played this on an f310 controller, I can't comment on how it plays with kb+m.","July 31, 2014","true","6.7"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

It's hard and unforgiving. I enjoyed this game, I really did, but most people probably won't. The game has a good difficulty climb, everytime they introduce a new enemy, you fight it 1v1 before you fight it in a group. you have about 3 melee attacks, a boost, and a parry, not a block, a parry, so you have to time it right. The graphics aren't anything special, but nothing bad. This game requires good tactics and strategy of pure hack and slash which keeps it from getting boring. The game is divided into to "chapters" and if you get a gameover, you have to start the whole chapter all over again, which can get annoying, luckily, bosses have their own chapter. The bosses are actually the easiest part of the game and it's REALLY short. I can't recommend this game to most players because it's hard and you will die A LOT, but if you're someone that feels like you're trapped in a world of cake-walks, this game is for you.","August 17, 2014","true","5.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","1"

I'm uncertain if the developer understood what kind of combat system they were making.\n\nSee, while the greenlight page and the developer's blog both made suggestions that it's a similar breed of game to Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, it really isn't. The gameplay ends up being a balance closer to Ninja Gaiden, where one spends much of their time kiting enemies to leave one vulnerable enough to actually deal some damage. Between the wide area attacks, and large enemies with uncounterable (though not unblockable, as I first thought) attacks, and projectile attacks, almost every enemy in the game encourages the player to stay away as defense. This in of itself isn't a bad thing; it can lead to hit and run tactics, which I had initially tried, only to realize that it's near impossible to do so.\n\nExcept, the tools the player has aren't built for kiting, or for hit and run. They're built for dueling. One on one fights against enemies with complex patterns. The parry/counter system is actually fairly well implemented. The player has full ability to defend against melee attacks, and end a batch of them with a counter attack to reverse momentum a bit. It still needs some fine-tuning, because the larger enemies (such as the hammer guys, or the gun-type's melee attack) seem to have the parry window mistimed. No, where the game actually starts to fall apart is the dashing. It's unresponsive, with what feels like a 5-10f startup, it has a limited duration, and because it has a "special attack" associated with it, The player can't use it to reengage with an enemy. Especially since the dash attacks are the only attacks you have that can't be canceled with a parry. What this means is that the attack the player is supposed to be using defensively, to wear down enemy armor, is only useful AFTER the shields are down. The player can't dash in and out of range, because the startup is so long that the player will not have moved out of the way by the time the attack lands, assuming they're dodging from reaction, and not trying to predict when the enemy is going to counterattack. It means that the grenades end up being far more dangerous than they should be with the huge window you have, because the player can't use the only way to escape its range in time.\n\nI have other minor gripes with the combat, such as not being able to parry from the counter animation, which means that seemingly open windows for counter attack are actually just a chance to get wrecked. The player can parry from the parry's cooldown, but it can't parry from the counterattack. The overdrive system doesn't actually require variety. It's VERY easy to max it out using only the normal attacks, which I'd eventually resorted to, for reasons I've already stated. Lastly, the game has some minor issues communicating thus far. I didn't realize the grenadier enemies were different from the first enemies I fought until I saw both in the same fight. They have the same animations, and since both the initial weak enemy and the grenadiers have red heads, they look identical. The only visual difference they have blends into the background. The range of a grenade is illustrated by the red circle that initially appears around it, but when it explodes, the game shows nothing, except the player getting flung away. Only the player is thrown away, I should add. I presume it's an attempt to keep the player from using grenades against the enemies that threw them, except that similar tactics are specifically designed for use against the gun enemies when they appear.\n\nDragonsix, or Ben L. Grauer, whichever you would prefer: Redo how dashing works, or Rebalance the enemies for the combat system you actually have. Now, I'm far from an expert, and I can't very well crack open the code and see how well the changes I'd make would work in practice, but I do play enough action games to have some sense of what works and what doesn't, and why. Make the dash FAR more responsive by letting the player cancel into it. Maybe not let them immediately cancel out of it, but at the option to at least cancel into the dash would mean that a surprise grenade can be dealt with in time. In fact, you might very well be able to make the window tighter without interfering with the gameplay. Either remove the dash attack, or make its supposed anti-shield properties far more drastic. The player shouldn't have to worry about accidentally doing a dash attack and being unable to parry because of it. Don't punish the player for being risky, punish them for failing to take advantage of near misses. Other reviews have made suggestions of being able to parry the lasers from the gun enemies, and while that sounds pretty awesome, being able to dash in and out of the line of fire sounds far cooler. Take your pick. Tweak the overdrive system so that it actually requires variety, while you're at it.\n\ntl;dr - Either let the player cancel into the dash so that they can take advantage of it in short bursts, or tighten up the parry system. I'd recommend the former, so you aren't wasting the mechanics you have. Tweak your visual designs so they communicate better. This game does NOT feel finished, just yet.","August 4, 2014","false","1.4"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","29","44","0","12"

I picked normal difficulty figuring it couldn't be that hard. When I played the tutorial, I thought this game was gonna be super easy. When I played the first level, I enjoyed the challenge. When I played the second, I was so sick and tired of this game putting me through hell. By the end? I just wanted it to end. And then? I came upon the final boss. I had 6 lives left. I figured, I can take this chump. 5 lives remaining. I began to adjust to his moves. 4 lives remaining. I had his moves figured out, and then realized he had a "final form". 3 lives remaining. I tried to adjust to his final form's moves. 2 lives remaining. I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and let my anger entice me into making some stupid mistakes because I saw a way to possibly end the fight quicker. 1 life remaining. I took my patient time and tried my hardest, and my reflexes failed me. No lives remaining. I sighed, I couldn't do it. I was going to lose this game and uninstall it in a frenzy of rage and despair. I got to his final form, I took my time, realizing there was only ONE safe point to attack him every 30 seconds, and so I let the time roll on and I got further than ever before. My adrenaline kicked in and I repeated my formula that had brought me this far. I got him down to a sliver of health, i cheered! But then I made some lousy mistakes, and we both hung on our final slivers. I saw my chance, struck, and won the game, just barely.\n\nProxy Blade Zero is a challenging third person action hack and slash. You string together combos, dodge enemies at the right times, and adapt to the moves of new enemies who slaughter you upon first contact, but you slaughter by the hordes towards the end.\n\n+The game looks insanely unique graphically. The setting is greatly displayed.\n+The combat is smooth, fluid, and responsive. Just perfect for a game like this.\n+The enemy variety is more than I expected for a game as short as this.\n+The level design is pretty cool. You have to find discs that allow you to open doors until you get to a master key which unlocks the end of the chapter, rinse and repeat until the last boss. With a new surprise awaiting you on every level.\n-The game is also extremely short. I beat it in 86 minutes\n-The story is really...not there. You have to kill some ultimate bad guy with an army and you mow through his army and fight him. It had no effort put into it whatsoever.\n-There is no actual replayability since the level design is not random, but linear.\n-The tutorial teaches you how to play the game in xbox controls. I'M A ♥♥♥♥ING PC PLAYER. I DON'T USE A ♥♥♥♥ING CONTROLLER. TEACH ME HOW TO PLAY WITH A MOUSE AND KEYBOARD SO i DON'T HAVE TO CLOSE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME AND MEMORIZE EVERY LAST ♥♥♥♥ING KEY BEFORE I CAN ACTUALLY LAUNCH THE GAME. And that being said.\n-The controls are ONLY visible when you have the game closed. Forget something mid-combat? "♥♥♥♥ YOU" The developers said. Along with not giving you a proper tutorial you have to exit the game just to check the controls, AND to change the graphics. Oh, that too...\n-There's little to no graphics options. I know this is a console port but come on. MSAA and that's it? No textures? No Shadows? Lighting? Just that? This is PC. Not xbox. If you're going to do a port, then put some effort into it.\n\nWhile the cons clearly outweigh the pros, what matters the most is how much fun you're having once you are actually in the game. And I had a whole bunch of fun. This game earns an 7.5/10, brought down that far by its many flaws. But the core gameplay is there, and it is good. But before I give this a higher rating I'd need to see major fixes into all those negatives. If any of the negatives bother you, don't pick this up. This game is abandonware. I have never seen them update this game. If they don't bother you? Then pick it up! It'll keep you entertained for an hour and a half at least.

But I think it's good.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/0-vnPIHXpyM\nhttp://youtu.be/T80pxMECUfo\nFor me the experience of this game was as described, the difficulty is pretty hardcore. You have to be able to react instantly in order to block attacks, with certain enemies there is only a specific window of opportunity during which you are able to damage them. You only have a relatively small amount of health which does not regenerate and you seldom come across extra health. The first boss encounter was hard for me, but it's sequence of attacks appeared to be very scripted. So you can basically learn when to parry and when to attack by rote, but that obviously can take a lot of trial and error which it did for me. I died a lot using that method lol. Another reason that this game was hard for me was simply because I kept pressing parry instead of attack and vice versa. I need to play more to get used to the controls and I'm also probably just not used to the Xbox 360 control. As well as that this is not a game that's ideally played when you aren't fully alert e.g. not after just getting up like I was when I first played. I don't think it helped that I extra slow witted instead of my regular slow witted today lol. Anyway I've actually kept playing and now I've got the hang of the game, it helped to put it on easy difficulty. I got to the last boss which is pretty damn hard. I got him down to like 25% health but then it became even more difficult! I came close to the end but I think it'll take me another full session just to beat the last part of the game! And that is in easy difficulty... One little thing to mention I think that boss is supposed to be able to know you off the platform where the battle takes place. However when my character was knocked out of it he just stood in midair instead of falling. It was an amusing moment =)\n\nI thought the game looked not just decent but good. Yes the models are made up of basic looking polygons and it's not 'AAA' graphics. But I looked up the developer DragonSix and apparently it is a one person team and that this is their first completed title. So I think they've done a pretty good job. My favourite thing was seeing the projectiles that the final boss shoots at you flying past.\n\nI think that the gameplay itself is solid.To me personally fancy (best word I can think of right now lol) graphics just do not matter to me.

X is your Parry. Right Trigger is your glide (a "dodge" that isn't, but which is used AS a dodge, if that makes sense). That's pretty much it (and then there is a Lock-on with Left Trigger and another button that cycles your targets, but I never use it).\n\nAny enemy that has a Shield can attack while being attacked. A button-masher this is not; you must be discerning in when you do what. Most actions can be cancelled into other ones - still, the game is very hardcore and very punishing of the slightest mistake.\n\nWhen you encounter a new sort of enemy, the first battle with them is a 1v1 so that you might learn of their techniques. Very quickly, the rooms will mix and match the squads; each battle is challenging in its own way (to be clear, there is no randomness factor, except in the drops). You will die. A lot.\nYou start with 3 lives. Every time you enter a new room, that is where you will respawn. Enemies can drop Health and Lives - don't count on it. Once your lives are exhausted, you start the entire mission over.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is so simple - the main point of the game, the combat, is so rewarding once you can get into the groove of things. It's pretty amazing: Proxy Blade Zero is built around a methodical approach to combat, yet everything about it is so hectic; from watching your Battery Power (used while Gliding) to the stance of the enemy you're focusing on, to rushing to spin the camera around so that you can get a better feel for what you're facing, all while having to react within fractions of a second... I am hard-pressed to think of another game that utilizes its minimalism in such an effective way.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game.\n\nEDIT: The game is short though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trame/recommended/313980/","trame","[choo choo] Trame Train","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trame/","303 products in account","I love this game.\n\nI recommend it to anyone with nostalgia for (good) early 3D games. There's no getting around that the graphics are pretty barebones, the environments are often empty and repetitive, the story is basically nonexistent despite being organized as a campaign, and the way you move around the level has a sort of "my first 3D game" feel (a series of disconnected rooms with non-animated "doors" that are essentially teleports). However, while these make the game feel a little unpolished, they don't make it bad. Many professionally-developed 3D games felt the same way, before developers had the experience, money, and tools required to make the kind of games we usually get today. And many of those early 3D games were still very good. This one is too.\n\nWhat this game delivers is very simple and challenging reaction-based combat. You have only a handful of options - a dash, a parry/counter, and an attack button that can be modified in two different ways to create combos. There are no extraneous gameplay systems, and on top of that, there's no scoring or experience systems to let you know how well you're doing. Instead, enemies deal high damage and there's a limited lives system (rare, these days) so you'll know you're doing okay by the fact that you're not dying. Past that, the distinction between getting by (constantly running and taking potshots at the enemies) and playing well (using your combos as much as possible while perfectly countering your enemies or dashing just out of attack range) is immediately obvious, and playing well is so much more efficient and satisfying that there's rarely a need to try to cheese the AI until you're one hit from death.\n\nThe key design element that makes this game more than a simple combat engine - which otherwise would absolutely devolve into an endless series of boring fights - is the intelligent way the developers introduce and combine different enemy types. Very rarely do any two serious fights feel the same. While some threats are clearly bigger than others, enemy damage is so high that no enemy be completely ignored, and while you deal damage in a small area of effect, your ability to actually lock down groups of enemies that aren't all of the weakest type is virtually nonexistent (unlike some other games, your counter only staggers enemies that were actually attacking you, not all enemies in range). Therefore, you have to quickly and intelligently choose how to approach the group in front of you and which targets to take out first. Fighting a group of enemies that must all be countered is very different from fighting even one such enemy and an enemy that can stagger you when you try to counter, let alone fighting either group while also dealing with enemies that can counter your own attacks or attack from range.\n\nProxy Blade Zero isn't perfect, and probably has limited appeal for a big chunk of people on Steam. People who aren't used to this level of difficulty aren't going to like it, and people accustomed to the way the vast majority of modern games work - with multiple overlapping gameplay systems, well-managed checkpointing rather than lives, or expansive, cinematic storylines - are probably going to be confused by what anyone sees in it. But if you miss simple games designed by small teams to experiment with what you can do with a simple concept - and can handle the lack of polish that frequently accompanied that - Proxy Blade Zero does pretty much exactly what it sets out to do, and is easily worth the low asking price. I can't remember the last time I played a game like this; most developers can't resist at least throwing in leveling and loot systems, and while it's impossible for me to tell if they're only missing here for development reasons, I hope DragonSix keeps this basic design sensibility in mind if they ever make a sequel.","December 9, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The combat in in itself is very tedious, with only about six attacks in the game and no real way to string them in interesting fashions. The parry mechanic isn't as fleshed out as it should be, with many of the multi-hitting strings of enemies being invincible to the counter attack, as well as the boost not being a real asset, more as just a glorified sprint button. There is an absurd amount of recovery on each move as well as enemies taking huge bites out of your life, this game promotes a very hit and run style of play unlike Devil May Cry or other bastions in the genre. While, being made by one man, this is an incredible feat to be sure, I cannot recommend this game to the average consumer. I hope he finds work because of his skill, but this is clearly a game with a lot of care put into it just without the amount of staff on deck to give it the love and care it deserved.","August 15, 2014","false","1.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

No dialog, no cutscenes, no stupid physics puzzles or jumping, what it DOES offer is a solid challenging action combat system of parries, jetting about like a madman (madrobot), and overall striking at enemies where they are weak and you won't take a robotic fist to the robotic face for your trouble. The parry window is generous, so you don't have to be a royal guard nutter to apply but you absolutely must fight smart.\n\nIt looks a little rough, yes, and is certainly not flashy, but if you watch the videos or get the demo on XBLIG you will certainly taste the craft and effort that went into the combat. There's a real, honest, though-out combat system here and I daresay that it certainly manages to be more interesting on a purely combat-systematic level than Metal Gear Rising. (Not to knock MGR, I love it dearly and it wins out on glamor, satisfaction, excitement, and bosses, but... really, the mook combat in that game was parry parry parry parry slash at giant HP soak enemies parry slice QTE.

Rather than killing enemies stylishly, the main draw of the game is your ability to weave between enemies, block, dash, and counter. In other words, it is more focused on how well you can avoid damage rather than how well you can deal it, creating a relatively intense and novel experience.\n\n\nPros:\n- No filler. There aren't any annoying puzzles (simple things like activate these 3 switches in 3 adjacent rooms), backtracking is minimal, no convoluted rooms, etc.\n- Controls. Controls are responsive and work pretty well with either mouse and keyboard or a controller. I would like to note though that transitioning between the two is a bit awkward.\n- Enemy Variety. There are quite a few enemies that you encounter that you develop specific ways to handle, each with their own behavior. Then the developer decides to mash up the composition of each group of enemies you fight, multiplying the types of combat situations you can find yourself in.\n-Combat. Combat is very streamlined with only the bare essentials. You have a block, a directional dash, and 3 attack combos whose moves you can go to regardless of the combo you are in. The different combos have different effects with different trade offs between damage, mobility, and animation time. While most attacks are blockable, a few are not and require the player to dash out of the way. Mistiming a block or failing to do a dash can be punished with damage.\n\nCons:\n- Length. While my first run took roughly 3 hours, it would now probably take less than an hour now. It's a very short game with no new game bonuses (as far as I know).\n- Graphics. It doesn't look very pretty with very few textures and models that have very few polygons.\n- Difficulty. While fair, it has a high skill curve and floor. The game expects you to fully understand the block/dodge timings for an enemy only after the first time you see the enemy. Furthermore, difficulty is very simplistic and only fiddles with numbers like how much damage an enemy deals rather than change enemy behavior.\n- Occasional AI issues. While very infrequent, sometimes enemies go into a "stupid" loop where they just move in circles and soak damage for no reason, killing the intense pacing of the game.\n- Jumping. There is no jumping. It's by no means a necessary mechanic but it seems weird to not have it in a third person game.\n- Bosses. Kinda underwhelming to fight one predictable opponent after you fight a horde of unpredictable opponents.\n\n\nOverall experience:\nThe game tests you constantly. "Barely finished a group? Here, let me see you handle some from that group and some from this group." As a result, every time you succeed, it delivers little packets of euphoria every time you master how to respond to an opponent, every time you dive into a horde of enemies while perfectly counterattacking everything, every time you barely eek out of a mission, every time you whoosh around picking off enemies one by one, etc. It has this sense of elegance and precision as you need to actually understand each mechanic before progressing. This game rewards you not with score, not with experience and levels, but by changing you, the player, from a clumsy fool to a dancing, robot killing expert.\n\nAll in all, while this game suffers from the fact that it was made by 1 person, I'd recommend any fighting game/beat 'em up fan to pick this up especially if it's on sale.","May 15, 2015","true","4.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It doesn't bother me much, of course if you can't absolutely live without new generation graphics, you'll have a problem :) A shame if you like fast action paced beat them all, since the gameplay is very interesting and full of finesse. Also I like the music very much and it was a pleasant surprise compared to many indie game where the music is terrible.\n\nIn fact, like DMC, Bayonetta, MGS:R, you can really go mad with this game once you master it. You can rush in the middle of an enemy pack, parry the enemy that attacks you from behind, dodge, combo and whatever and it still remains challenging.\n\nThe more interesting aspect of the gameplay is the dash gauge, and I agree with Bonsewswesa: it reminds me of Dark Soul. This gauge depletes itself when you make special attacks or when you use the reactor at your back to move faster. Parrying and attacking with all other attack types do not depletes this gauge, so you still have a wide range of attacks even if you have no more energy, but it is a lot harder to dodge without it. So, like Dark Soul, you should never completely deplete it (a sound is played when you are low on energy, which is a good idea, I could use that in Dark Soul :-p).\n\nThe game is not very long, but the replay value is here. I think finishing this game on critical difficulty without any continue is my next challenge. But I sure hope that the maker will make a sequel with more levels.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is well worth its price, and I'm really impressed that a single guy has made it, great job!","July 31, 2014","true","6.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Even off sale, £4 is pretty reasonable for how well it plays.  For a more detailed look at the combat systems, see below.\n\nStory is sparse, graphics aren't the best (though the art direction is good given what they're working with). You don't get new abilities, there's no platforming, you start the game with the exact same character build you finish with.  It's  entirely  streamlined around its combat systems, which is totally fine when they're so much fun.\n\nYou have a dash, parry (which cancels out of any move) and combo attacks by alternating between regular hits and 'stance' inputs.  Parries will deflect physical attacks but not ranged ones, dashing runs off a limited power meter which recharges, and some enemies employ shielding which renders them immune to stagger until broken.\n\nIt's fundamentally simple, but punishes mistakes quickly; your character gets staggered and left briefly unable to attack upon taking damage, and you don't have invincibility frames, meaning one hit in a group of enemies can lead to an entire health bar being wiped.  To that end the game, particularly in the latter half, is very much focused on spacing - keep in as close to one-on-one engagements as you can, and dash away otherwise.\n\nMost of the difficulty comes from reading enemies; most only have one or two telegraphed attacks, but keeping track of groups while parrying and dashing away from projectiles is frenetic, fast, and extremely satisfying when you get a flow going.  Controls in fights feel fast and snappy, and deaths are typically down to an error that you committed, rather than unfairness.\n\nIt's not a long game by any means - my Normal difficulty run took about 50 minutes from start to end.  The lives system means you get thrown back to the start of a stage upon losing all of them (losing a life with some left in stock just restarts you at the last room you entered), so runs with Game Overs would probably take a little longer, as I expect to discover when attempting Critical difficulty.\n\nAs long as you're not under illusions about length or story, Proxy Blade Zero is a great little character action game for the price.

I'm usually not able to get myself to the top of the leaderboard with crazy combos, but I can manage to muddle through on Easy at least and have fun bashing a lot of guys around.  Proxy Blade Zero looked like a fun romp despite the safely budget graphics, but then I tried to play it.\n\nThe options are rather bare, and in a launcher at that. But okay, indie dev porting a game off XBIG, could live with it if at least I could enjoy the game. Unfortunately I can't. From the very start I have trouble performing the moves the tutorial wants me to. Trying to chain B and Y into some sort of smooth combo just isn't working no matter how I press the buttons and adjust the timing. Holding Right Trigger and Y is awkward and I can't really tell if it's working or not. The timing on the parry is weird, which will become an issue later. And Left Trigger and Left Button at the same time? That just doesn't work. I'm not going to hold the trigger down with my middle finger the whole time just to be able to use the target switching button, and trying to transition my finger up to hit the button while also holding the trigger is slow and likely to drop you out of lock anyway. A lot of my issues with the game are subjective, but that one is an objective flaw with the (un-rebindable) controls; most people don't use the controller with two fingers on the top buttons, and the game can't be played adequately without doing so.\n\nAnyway, played through the first level, but combat feels slow and stilted. There's a certain flow to it the game is expecting me to find, and I can't find it. I also can't get out of the way of enemy attacks very well. That's usually what I do in these games, rather than use the dodge, block, etc. mechanic, but the game is clearly pointing me to use parry or I'm going to get hit. This becomes even more apparent when I come up to the boss. Some moves are literally impossible to avoid without parrying, but I still just can't use it; it feel like I've always mistimed it one direction or the other, though mostly too late for its large wind-up time. So I die. And I die. And I fall through the world at one point, though thankfully I do not die, then I die at the hands of the boss again. I just keep dying because I can't reliably block. Getting a combo working on him is also capricious, sometimes I'll just keep hitting him and sometimes I'll only hit him once and I have no idea why. And I need to use this combo system I can't get to work because I can't just run around and chip at his health, it literally doesn't hurt him. The game uses this battle to force you to take on its mechanics its way...and frankly I just could figure it out. I gave it all four of my lives running my face into the boss trying to figure it out and I couldn't do it. So I gave up right there.\n\nIf you're really good at spectacle fighters and can forgive the technical faults of poor console port, Proxy Blade Zero might be a fun game. Dunno. Couldn't tell you myself. If you're a casual fan of spectacle fighter who just likes to push buttons and see stuff blow up you should probably stay away from this game because it demands more of you than that.","June 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The gameplay is just good and solid despite other shortcomings.\n\nGOOD\n\nThe gameplay is basic, but solid.  There's no RPG elements, upgradable weapons, or anything else besides what you start with.  It's structured more like an older game than a new one where the only improvement there is in how well YOU play the game.  And boy there is A LOT of improvement you can do in this game.  There's also no 'mission control' which is great, you can just focus on the enemies.  You'll need it because each enemy has it's own strengths and will use them liberally.  The difficulty pacing is just about right.  New enemies are introduced slowly at first, giving you time to get used to them, then pairing them up against old foes in new situations.\n\nBAD\n\nDespite hitting right in so many areas it drops the ball in some others... Let's get this out of the way first.  The graphics are bad.  The player and enemies are all low polygon, reminicant of early PS2, or maybe even an N64 game.  Textures look basic, and environments are uninspired.  It all basically just serves as an arena for you to fight all the enemies.  The controls while fine, feel a little loose in some areas.  Specifically blocking and boosting.  When you block you can only go straight into a counter.  Sometimes this works against you, and sometimes the counter won't hit at all.  It seems like it's programmed to only counter hit when you SHOULD be counter hitting despite what the animation looks like.  Enemies have a great degree of tracking so boosting ends up being either useless or a necessity.  There's also a lack of a jump button which is a bit weird in a hack n' slash but it's made around that fact.  The camera lockon and the way the combat system works seems to encourage 1v1 fights, but the vast majority of the game will be mob battles.  There's really only two real bosses.  Which is extremely disappointing.  Both are pretty basic though still difficult because of input speed required.\n\nCONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM\n\nMore bosses! Gameplay like this thrives in boss battles.  They could be more interesting instead of using re-used assets from other enemies.  A jump might make level design more interesting, but only if the jump physics were done right.","January 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

But i've enjoyed it enough so far that i figured i'd do a review.)\n\nSummary: This game, is fun. Frustrating, but fun. It isn't the greatest looking game, but it looks nice enough, the soundtrack fits the mood, and the gameplay is fairly tight.\n\nThere isn't exactly much of a story past the opening text dump. Basically: Good Robotguything wants to stop the Evil Robotguything. The main focus was definately on the gameplay.\n\nThe game is a character action, spectacle fighter hack and slash ALA Devil May Cry, God of War, ETC. It's got a fairly simple, if deep enough to be enjoyable combat system. Press a button for basic attacks, a different button for power attacks, etc. The game's sort of "calling card" as it were, is the addition of a dash. It's useable any time as long as you have the energy, and if you attack during the dash, it does an "energy attack" which does more damage to shields, and combined with power attacks basically tears through anything.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that it quickly manages to show you that doing what it tells you is probably a BAD idea. It teaches you in the (thankfully short) tutorial how to attack, dash, parry and some other stuff. The tutorial definately teaches you that parrying attacks is a GOOD thing, because you can power down enemy shields with it. Welp, by the third level, the game will start throwing enemies at you that if you get close and try to parry their melee attack, it'll knock you into a stun animation and they'll just attack you again, and take off a rather large chunk of your health. Then it starts throwing these enemies at you in droves, forcing you to play a game of "dash up, dash away, do two attacks to their shield, repeat."\n\nOverall, the game is quite good though, if very short. I'd definately recommend it at sale price, and even at full price if you can accept that it'll be short, but quite good. (And can accept that it'll be a little frustrating. x3)\n\n","July 10, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That being said, while it is a reasonably good game in my short experience of it, it is a TERRIBLE port of a XBLA game.\nThere is both keyboard and gamepad controls, though it is made clear that the keyboard is not recommend. One can only change the options before launching, there is basically only resolution and keyboard binders for options, no way to rebind gamepad controls. The lack of rebinding gamepad controls is a major issue, as Y/Triangle is your basic attack, instead of X/Square. X/Square is a parry, which interupts you for a moment so if you use it when the enemy is not attacking you will not able to move/attack, and leave yourself open for retaliation.\nI've lost many good openings due to muscle memory and developers who implemented a substandard port of a game. There also does not seem to be a way for me to close the game, though maybe I am missing something, but for now it is alt-tab to desktop and close it from the outside.\nWhich is shame, the game is very fun. It is light on plot and has a somewhat generic "robots fightng other robots on a spaceship/dungeon" setting. However no one is playing this game for the story; the combat is the core of the game, and it is fast, fluid, stylish and a great challenge (or maybe I just need to Git Gud). It requires a good reflexes, energy management (which is used in power attacks, boosts/dodging), well timed dodges and parries and situational awareness.\nThe problem with a game with controls that can't be changed (unless you go with the not recommend keyboard/awkward controls) and needlessly unintitive button mapping hold back an otherwise mechanically solid video game.\nI bought it on sale for 2$, so I got what I paid for, but I think players should know that is both A) An excellent, focused Action game that will satifsy those who like challenge and B) An awful PC port that holds back the game because it lacks basical levels of PC functionality. I mean, I own a console and rebinding controls is pretty common even on consoles, and I can think of handheld games that allow me to rebind controls too.\nEdit: I just beat the game, I played on easy so I imagine the harder difficulties are longer, but that is still probably only 4-6 hours on the hard modes. I would have played on that difficulty had I known the game would be so short to play.","February 13, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Playing through the tutorial, I was a bit unnerved that upon explaining how to play the game, this game is strictly for using a controller (360 controller specifically). I don't own a 360 controller, and have to use a keyboard and mouse. You can use the keyboard and mouse still, but they explain the tutorial using the buttons on a 360 controller. So my first gripe is that they don't explain the tutorial with keyboard and mouse buttons. You have to look in the controls to view the key layouts. Another gripe, is the inability to jump. I enjoy mid air combos A LOT in hack and slash games and I feel like a jump feature would add to the game and make it slightly better. Other than those minor details, the pluses in this game DEFINITELY outweigh the negative. The graphics are fairly simple, straight to the point. The soundtrack is pretty nice.

This game offered none of that. It all but requires an xbox controller to use, but it doesn't even make use of the few controls on the gamepad. A is select (that's it it opens doors) B gets your character in "technique" to attack, Y is the attack, and X block. The right trigger and bumper boost you, and the opposite lock target. Now while few controls may not be a bad thing, the lack of variations to attacks gives no flow to the game.\n\nThere are only two attack animations / patterns, and a boost attack which is a one swing move that does not a thing. The regular attack where you just mash Y over and over (which does fukall to your opponents health), and the "technique" attack (mashing B and Y consecutively, oh joy) which does some damage, but leaves you stuck going one direction. Oh, and you can do a little blip sort of "counter" to opponents you block but it's more of a hinderance to you than them. Both of these pattens are boring, and do little to invest your attention into the action. What little of it there is.\n\nThe main mission flow of the game is to go through rooms and kill two, maybe three opponents each until you find a key to unlock the next set. That's all I have to say for the experience. Some enemys have shields, some don't. Oh and there are a few rediculously O enemys with huge laser cannons. They fail to inform you of there existance from the start. And while those opponents hit hard and require a little thought from your end to kill them, you really only have three attack patterns so...\n\nAll in all, I'd say that this game is the "tic-tac-toe" of slasher games. It does little to invest you in the combat, does not push graphics of any modern standard, and isn't much fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terry309/recommended/313980/","terry309","terry309","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terry309/","60 products in account","Proxy Blade Zero is a character action game (or hack n slash) which puts you in control of a humanoid robot named Fenrir a smaller version of Jehuty from Zone Of The Enders who can't fly but can dash. Seriously if you've played Zone Of The Enders you will find the combat very similar, just on a smaller scale. In fact that combat is actually more fun that Zone Of The Enders because it doesn't try too many things and keeps things simple.\n\nCombat is the name of the game here. You have your parry button X (an odd choice) your attack button marked Y (Classic DMC style) and B is a delay which transforms your regular attacks with standard attacks. Using the right trigger allows you to dash and perform energy attacks.\n\nThe only problem I had with the combat were the controls, mostly the fact that X is the parry button. I'm serious when I say that this is the game's only flaw. Often you will mistake the X button for attack which will lead to many deaths. This game is hard and I died to the final boss just because I pressed Y to block, thinking I was playing Sleeping Dogs or something.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if they offered you the ability to changed the controls. Remember my last blog talking about the importance of options in videogames? That applied here too. The option to customize your control layout is important for a game and I'm still baffled as to why Character action games still fail to do this.\n\nThe enemies you fight in the game are very punishing and you will have to learn them fast. Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish enemies from one another. Shielded enemies don't stagger. This isn't explained in game but you'll learn this soon enough. You can tell a shielded enemy from a non shielded enemy by the blue bar over their head. To remove a shield you can press Y after a successful block to perform an EMP blast which removed their shield and leaves them vulnerable to attack.\n\nThis can get pretty chaotic when there are multiple enemies as the animation for the emp blast keeps you still for a couple of seconds so you have to be very careful when to use it. One particular enemy I fought pushed me too far away to make use of the emp blast. As such I had to literally wait for it to run out of shields. You see shields and energy are the same, energy attacks used by the enemy are unblockable same can't be said for yours though so you have to dash away to avoid them. However dashing uses energy so you have to be tactical.\n\nProxy Blade Zero is a thinking mans hack n slash, kinda like a puzzle but which punishes those who don't think fast. As such I highly recommend playing on easy first to save yourself the punishment and learn the enemies. I cannot stress this enough. You will die a lot, health is dropped by enemies but in very small doses so you have to be very conservative with your health. Some situations will make you want to be more aggressive, others more defensive. You have to make quick judgement in this game.\n\nBasically it's not like Devil May Cry where you just use any random attack string to KO enemies. In Proxy Blade Zero, each enemy has a set strategy on how to KO them. The challenge is to find their weak point and rinse and repeat. A concept that wouldn't work in most games but in Proxy Blade Zero, it works really well. Enemies are varied and you will have to change your tactics quick. You will also find some really difficult situations where you'll have to think outside the box.\n\nProxy Blade Zero isn't a reaction based hack n slash, parrying gives you a pretty comfortable time-frame which doesn't punish players for poor timing. This is ideal as it allows anyone to pick up and play this game which can only be a good thing. Proxy Blade Zero is all about quick thinking and dexterity and rewards players who can develop such skills.\n\nAs such if you're the sort of player who loves freedom in creativity, you've picked the wrong game in Proxy Blade Zero. It's a puzzle game with heavy emphasis on speed so if you dislike puzzle games you'll probably dislike this game. I personally feel that the game is just not for me despite the fact that I love the visuals and enjoy the music, the gameplay itself, though flashy just isn't my cup of tea personally. Just throwing that out there.\n\nOne system I like in particular though is the momentum system (can I call it that?). Every successful action increases an orange bar which enhances Fenrir's attack speed which allows you to chain even more combo's using both delay and energy attacks for a satisfying finisher. It may not be as varied and flashy as Devil May Cry but it's still a nice feature to have.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, the visuals are very Tron inspired which can only be a good thing. I personally like how the textures feel very crisp as does the nebula skybox. It feels like a universe that is cool (and isn't ruined by a "being inside a computer" plot point) and makes the world feel very technologically advanced. The levels look varied. There are many exterior sections, city-like sections and interior sections to spice things up.\n\nThe music accompanies it well enough and though it's not the most memorable soundtrack, it has a really nice techno feeling to enhance the ambiance. Honestly, this is a game which requires time to appreciate it's ambiance and is not just about being absorbed into the combat. There are some areas which look pretty nice, as if you want to explore more of it.\n\nSadly this is only a 2 hour long game with only 6 levels (I played on easy so it'll be longer on harder difficulties) but it's something you feel interested in despite it's basic concept. I think a sequel to this game would be really cool, maybe to fix the controls and add even more areas because I the tron style visuals just pulled me in.\n\nAll in all. Don't go into Proxy Blade Zero thinking you know what you're doing or it'll smack you hard. Play on easy, then normal and if you're really ballsy, critical. I think replaying the game will give you more value, there's achievements as well. In any case for a 1 man project, Proxy Blade Zero is a fantastic effort but I still have to point out the control issues as they were quite iffy. I did have a bit of fun though and the game didn't frustrate me too much (though it has it's rough bits) so I wouldn't consider it to be a game-breaker, moreso a nitpick. If you're looking for a puzzle based Hack N Slash that focuses more on thinking rather than comboing, this is the game for you. If you're looking for something which offers more freedom in combat then this game definitely isn't for you.\n\nHowever as much as the gameplay frustrated me to a degree (often due to the controls), I can't help but give this game merit as it does what it does really well. The gameplay is fluid and though it requires a degree of finesse to master, it does feel satisfying once you have conquered it. If you're patient and are looking for a game with a difficult learning curve I'd say pick it up as it's only £4.00 on steam, plus you get to support a 1 man dev and I always encourage the support of small devs.\n\nIf you're easily frustrated, like me. You may want to wait till steam sales to try it and see if it's worth your investment. It's a short game so you don't have to invest too much time into it to learn it. Plus there are always steam refunds if you aren't happy with it. At the end of the day, it all depends on whether you're into this style of game or not. If you're not just skip it.","December 12, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If it was free, I would have played it for an hour, taken note of the flaws, uninstalled and moved on with my life.  But seeing as the developer wants money for what is in essence an extremely bare bones product, I feel it my prerogative to write a (negative) review.\n\nYou're a robot, or a guy in a robot suit, who fights through generic Tron-esque environments, using a very limited range of moves, without any opportunity whatsoever for upgrading or diversifying gameplay.  There is virtually no depth to the gameplay -- you move from room to room, facing the exact same robot enemies, only paired up in different combinations.  Fighting is done using a never-changing and very limited arsenal of moves, beginning to end.\n\nAt the core of the fighting mechanics is the parry move.  This means blocking the enemy's attack and then responding with your own.  Unfortunately parry is completely broken.  Why?  Because you can only parry one enemy at a time;  parry lasts a pre-determined amount of time, meaning it cannot be stopped mid-move;  the latter means you have to wait for the parry animation to finish before you can do anything;  once parry finishes, there is a slight pause during which you cannot do anything, meaning if you parry one robot, its buddy will likely kill you in short order.\n\nYou can attack while holding the boost button, which means you're able to do more damage and attack more than one bot at a time.  Unfortunately this boost feature uses a (albeit rechargeable) battery.  What this amounts to is attacking, running away to recharge, then attacking, rinse and repeat.\n\nUsing normal attack will likely get you killed very quickly, as most of the time your strikes will only hit one enemy at a time, while that enemy's buddies pound on you soon after.  (This is in addition to there being NO EVADE BUTTON.)  You can also get stuck on enemies making for huge frustration.\n\nIn a game that is entirely built around melee fighting it is weird how inconsistent, mechanical and limited the fighting system is.  Every attack has a stop-start-stop sequence to it.  There is no flow to the action and it never feels biological.  This is in addition to striking distance being hard to judge and hit detection being a bit iffy.\n\nI've been playing the melee-based Phantasy Star On-line clone, Divine Souls, and that game puts you in very much the same situations as this one -- you enter a room and fight enemies using a melee weapon.  After defeating those enemies you move on to the next room, where more enemies spawn to test your mettle.  Divine Souls however has a great sense of fluidity to its combat.  It's fast, smooth, flowing, and above all fun.  Proxy Blade Zero's combat is none of these things.\n\nShould we even mention the aesthetics?  The environments are simplistic, drab, low-polygon boxes and completely bare of furnishings, interesting lighting or textures.  As I've mentioned before, the whole thing looks like a low-rent Tron knock-off.\n\nThere is no indication of a story.  No NPCs.  Nothing.\n\nOn top of it all you have an awful camera regularly blocking the action.\n\nI started off this review by calling this a "good freeware game".  Freeware games are however rated by different standards than commercial products.  In that sense, Proxy Blade Zero reminds me of Nitronic Rush, another freeware game to feature Tron-like aesthetics and barebones gameplay, this time however a racing game.  Nitronic Rush too suffers from not having its mechanics properly polished, and from the same general shallowness as Proxy Blade Zero.  Having said that, Nitronic Rush is much further along to being a commercial-quality product.\n\nSince I've been name-dropping other games, let me mention one more.\n\nOn Android there is a hack and slash title with virtually the same core concept and bare aesthetics as Proxy Blade Zero.  That game is Fallen World.  There is in my opinion no better example of how a shallow, simplistic concept can be layered with additional gameplay mechanics to create a deep, involving experience.  Fallen World does that by adding, firstly, RPG mechanics in the form of an upgradeable hero -- purchase new moves and improve your attributes, secondly, several concepts from the tower defense genre, e.g. placing turrets and NPCs which have various functions and assist you in battle (and are all upgradeable), and thirdly, a STORY, also known as motivation for doing what you're doing.\n\nProxy Blade Zero will not go in my Awful Games folder (thus joining the likes of Slaughtering Grounds, Ampu-Tea, Times Ramesside, etc.).  Instead it will go in my Unfullfilled Potential folder (thus joining the likes of Legends of Aethereus, Vox, Air Buccaneers, etc.).  Still, I get the impression the dev is finished with this game.  That would be a shame.  I plan on keeping it installed for a couple of months and seeing if the dev plans on building a more involving experience from what amounts to little more than a prototype.  In the mean time, I have too little time to waste on something which offers so little enjoyment.\n\nI'll finish with this thought -- why isn't Proxy Blade Zero in Early Access?","January 15, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/313980/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Its a hack/slash 3rd person sword fighting game with bad combat and bad controls. First off, as everyone has noted, you need a gamepad for this. But for some sadistic and stupid reason, the attack button is Y/triangle, the least used and most obtrusive button there is of the 4 main buttons on a controller, as your most used button in the game. Of course, no reason logical reason, buttons can't be remapped. Lets see the other problems. No real dodge/roll, you just have this jetpack button which takes a second lag to turn on (which is super helpful in quick combat where you need split second reactions) that sends you flying away, and isn't intuitive or helpful in close combat. Then there are your different types of attacks. Instead of just having to use say "x or b" as your energy attack to hit shields, no you need to press turbo and attack at the same time. Same goes for your special attack if they don't have shields, you have to press b/Y at the exact same time each attack for consecutive attacks, the stupidest thing ever. There is a reason 2 button presses are specials in games, because they are annoying to remember and time. This also begs the question, if you have a 2 button combo attack for shields, and 2 button attack for non-shields, doesn't that just make normal attacking obsolete......that's just illogical. But also doing the correct attack for the shields or non shields doesn't even seem to do that much more damage than normal attacking, the game just says slightly, so shouldn't we be rewarded more for using the better attacks?\n\nI have played games from onimusha, to DMC, to god of war, to blade symphony, to Chivalry. I have played tons of good functional and high-level combat games, and this is not one of them. Even if the environments are boring and the game is a bunch of training rooms again boring robots, the one thing they have to nail is the combat and controls, and they fail. There of course is no blocking, which makes sense, but there's a parry, but you have to remember to press square, a common attack button all the time, and then you have to remember to press triangle to attack after. So many times I would forget which is the right button combo for armor, non armor, or would press attack for parry, then parry for attack, or would forget the post parry counter button. Having such annoying 2 combo presses and multi button combos, then making the buttons the wrong actions, you are just asking for trouble. Then there are your enemies. You will have guys that can auto hit you with guns, come flying at you and do 20 hit spins that you can't dodge, auto spin around when you fly dodge behind them when they punch at you and still get to hit you. Also, the guys will get done attacking, and then will just randomly attack you while you're hitting them, or after their combo when you think you have an opening to attack. This is annoying since you can only parry, but they give no indication that they plan to attack, so you have no way to be smart about attacking and parrying. You basically have to sit there and only parry and then counter attack, because the system is so unreliable. The guys do major damage when they hit you and you hit like a puss. Your guy does look kind of cool though. Just find another game that's cooked all the way through, this one is only half-baked. 4/10.","May 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
