"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipolar_bear/recommended/320590/","bipolar_bear","Bipolar Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipolar_bear/","71 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWarside is a fast and fun arcade-style game with rpg elements that you can enjoy for free.  In fact, it wasn't until after I had already spent about 60 hours playing that I finally decided to go ahead and and purchase the $10 base game.  The $10 was well spent as I now have a permanent XP/credits/rewards bonus which is very beneficial as your character levels get into the teens.\n\nGetting Started\nBefore you can actually start playing the game you have to choose your character type from 1 of 4 options.  The main differences between the different types aside from appearance include the base attributes and type of special movement.\nFaceless: starts with high speed / low attack, can double-jump and hang on walls\nGuardian: starts with high armor / low speed, antigrav allows you to float around\nHuntress: starts with high attack / low armor, can dash through the air with great speed\nMercenary: is the most balanced to start with, uses a JetpackOnce you choose a character type you have to choose your class:\nDefender: Tank class - High armor and defense\nPreferred weapons: LMG, handgun\nGadgets: stationary shield, extended shield Assault: Main damage class. High attack capabilities\nPreferred weapons: assault rifles, melee\nGadgets: rocket, stationary turret Infiltrator: Damage class with some control abilities\nPreferred weapons: sniper rifle, shotgun\nGadgets: poison dart, stunning trap Destroyer: Damage class focusing on area damage\nPreferred weapons: rocket launcher, flamethrower\nGadgets: grenade, mine Medic: Healer class\nPreferred weapons: charger, SMGsNext you customize the appearance of your character and name them.  Finally, you choose from 1 of 3 factions, which are kind of pointless for now unless you want to play with friends in which case you should join the same one.\n\nMultiplayer\nWhen I first started playing this game I was routinely playing with other humans but in the time since the player base has decreased and I find myself usually playing with bots.  It's still a lot of fun though because you can get a great kill-death ratio and a lot of XP.  At the same time, this game is at its best when you have a human teammate to join forces with.\n\nGame Modes\nTypically you'll end up playing PVP, with any unused player slots being filled in bots.  There is also a co-op vs AI level which is a ton of fun if you can find coop players.  The last mode is a last stand type game mode where you and your team must survive waves of enemies.  Unfortunately, the last 2 game modes don't come into rotation often.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is fun enough to warrant playing as all of the character types and different classes.  Though it is not perfect and may take some getting used to, movement and weapons work well.  Rounds typically last 10-15 minutes and are fast paced.  Gameplay basically consists of trying to get as many kills as possible and/or capturing/holding control points while watching your shields and taking defensive actions to allow your shield to recharge in order to avoid getting killed.\n\nLevels/Stages/Maps\nThe different stages are excellent and there are numerous.  They are nicely rendered, visually appealing and contain tons of small details that keep them from feeling empty.  There are also certain areas where teams tend to cluster which turn into corridors for epic battles.\n\nThe stages do a good job of creating a flow that pits teams against eachother, particularly on the conquest game mode.  You will also have to change your play style depending on your character type and class due to their inherent strengths and weaknesses, and movement type, all of which makes for more variety.\n\nWeapons\nAssault rifles, sniper rifles, LMGs, SMGs, missile launchers, flame throwers, pistols, shotguns and a device for charging teammates shields.  You can also carry 2 gadgets such as a rocket launcher or grenade launcher, poison dart, shields, defensive stations, auto-turrets, traps and more.  There are also attachments you can add to each weapon to add secondary fire modes and increased range, damage, accuracy, etc.\n\nUpgrades\nThe main motivator for progressing in this game is upgrades.  Armor/weapon upgrades, weapon attachments, offensive/defensive gadgets/abilities, cybernetic implants, unique appearances and more.  All items require you to be a certain level to use and the tiers are laid out well enough so that you'll always be working towards the next tier of upgrades.\n\nShops\nYou can buy weapons, armor, etc. from shops and the market.  The regular shop sells the basic stuff which is easy to afford and good enough to get you through.  The faction shop sells the good stuff, but everything costs faction currency which is a commodity you collect by completing achievements.  Finally, the market is where players can go to sell their own items and buy from others, as such you can find some very useful and rare things here when the player base is active.\n\nCrafting\nUsing recipes and special components, you can craft special and rare weapons and armor.  I think the recipes cost too much in the faction shop but if you're lucky someone may sell what you want on the market.\n\nSpecial Abilities\nAs you level up you can build out your skill tree which enhances your stats and opens up special abilities.  For example, as an infiltrator with a sniper rifle you can gain abilities which make your next shot do the same damage as a headshot or lower your enemies defense.\n\nUser Interface\nThe user interface doesn't explain in great detail exactly how you are supposed to do everything but it's easy enough to figure out as you advance through the game.  The game didn't originally support the English language so there are some spelling and grammar discrepancies but nothing too bad.\n\nAudio\nThe music is well done and very fitting though sometimes I turn it off to play my own.  Weapon sound effects are sufficient.  There was a bug where the reloading sound would get stuck in a loop but the devs quickly fixed it.\n\nDevelopers/Staff/Community\nThe staff of the game has been vocal in the community, open to suggestions and accommodating to the player-base.  The community is small but includes some great people.\n\nFootnote\nSome of my information about character types and classes has been gleaned from http://www.indiedb.com/games/warside/features/warside-factions-character-types-and-classes-revealed","September 19, 2015","true","126.4"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","1"

Imagine 2d Planetside with a lower playerbase. Sure, its certainly not winning any graphics awards, but the game is fun and the graphics are actually quite decent for a 2d shooter.  The game is still quite buggy and the character creation changes don't always drag in game, but the class diversity is well done and I like the idea of having each "Race" being able to support most classes. I hope there are more Races on the way along with more classes, However I don't think the classes are balanced in the way that the infiltrator faceless can jump into the middle of a standoff with a Knife and kill everyone.\n\nIn the end, this is THE best 2d Sci-Fi shooter I have ever played, I'm barely into late game when writing this Review and I already love it.\n\nP.S.

(someone save me!)  There are some downsides to it though:\n\n1. Collision- If you get stuck between two enemies and a hard place you're ♥♥♥♥ed, plain and simple (and trying to jump like a boss over a gunfight can sometimes launch you across the map)\n\n2. Matchmaking- It takes so long to get into a match if you are trying to choose just one mode can easily take an upwards of a minute or more (though I own a clan so I don't experience as much any more but I still do occasionally)\n\n3. ♥♥♥♥ing medics man- Chargers (healing rays*) are way too overpowered. If an enemy has one you will be shooting at something quite similar to Wolverine. (yeah have fun trying to get through that) My personal advice would just be honorbru and stick it out in the gun fight like the rest of us lesser men. (please!!! For my sake at least)\n\nBut from my experience the actual gameplay and pros outweighs the cons, (especially if you have friends to coordinate and rage with) for example.\n\n1. Can run on a potato [I should know, I use a potato daily (albeit a windows 8 potato) ]\n\n2. Extremely fast-paced (though still slow enough to hit enemies as a B.A sniper *wink wink*. Sorry about any future headshots I may deliver to your reinforced Polyskull implant)\n\n3. Dev team- The good folks at Kraken Games are incredibly active in the communtity (like really active, I got bored and looked for reviews of this game and none of them broke 900 views yet there was Kraken games thanking for the review. Its almost creepy really)\n\n4. Community- So far the community is great aside from a few ingame (looking at you, you field medic ♥♥♥♥)\n\n5. Game Design- The ingame looks while not quite the best out there have a whole lot of work and thought put into them ( I have the art book so I get to see a whole lot of awesome stuff and lore. P.S. the second boss in the Elisa-66 mission is actually non-violent so shame on you, you big bully. P.P.S also I get to see the future plans for the next mission) (PLEASE KRAKEN GAMES!!!! MAKE THE SHIELD BEARER'S ARMOR OBTAINABLE WHEN IT COMES OUT! I AM BEGGING YOU!!!!!!!)\n\n6. Customization- Needless to say, you can either look like an awesome military soldier/ninja/explosives expert/cyborg tank (or in my case Samurai/assassin/resistance fighter/any armor combination topped with a sniper's hood type thing) thing, or you can look like a hobo who dug a bunch separate armor pieces out of a dumpster and topped it off with sunglasses (which are available ;) )\n\n7. Weapons- "so many guns, so little time" (oh and there is swords, hammers, and knives so yay for honorbru gameplay. Whats that you say? I am bringing a knife to a gun fight? Yes, yes I am and I'm coming for you next. Right after I deal with that medic behind you.....)\n\nAnd on a slightly stupid note (then again, hasn't this whole thing been a tad on the ridiculous side?) 11/10 would rage about medics again (in its current state I would probably give this a 8/10 for a free to play of its style and it can still get better)\n\nbuh bye m8's\n\n*edit*\nIn the time since my initial review this game's playerbase has dropped dramatically. Its still a good game so my positive review remains but there just not enough of a community to enjoy warside to its fullest potential. maybe if the developers finally crank out a new update and invest in some advertising this game will pick back up. but as it stands right now I just do not think that any newer players will find enjoyment unless you have a group of friends to fight the erratic hoards of "boogets" to atleast get some entertainment from this game.","May 30, 2015","true","88.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Everyone that actually chat in game are all nice and helpful.\nThe controls take a few games to get used to but after a few hours in it becomes easy to master the jumping/hovering.\nThere is a varity of weapons that each add their own form of gameplay. Certain pvp maps makes some guns better than others depending on if it has narrow passages or being wide open but that only adds to the strategy of having a good weapon makeup in your backpack.\n\nOverall as of right now if youre going into the game thinking it is a finished product youre going to have a bad time. If youre going into it just trying to have some fun maybe with some friends then youre going to enjoy yourself for quite some time.\n\nIt seems that the devs are making good progress with the game and I would expect it only to get better as time goes on.\n9/10 honestly.

Having only played 4 hours of this game as of this review, I obviously haven't seen everything. However, I still feel that I can recommend it to other fans of the Platform Shooter. If anyone's played the Platform Shooter Raze and its sequels, I find this game comparable and more well polished.\n\nGame Types: From what I've seen there are several currently available game modes put into two sections, PvP and PvE. Pretty standard so far. PvP currently has Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Gathering (Collecting/stealing Crystals from your enemy team to improve score) under its belt. While PvE has Siege (Wave Defense) and Mission, which so far seems to be almost like the story line where you battle a total of three bosses and rooms full of enemies. And these are the only missions I currently have access to being a Level 5. None of them have gotten personally repeditive, and I always get a good laugh out of a game whenever my body ragdolls across the map (I should add I'm terrible at this game, but love it anyway.)\n\nWeapons/Gear: I'll only briefly go into this, as there are a ton (Well, enough for a Platformer like this) of weapons and gear to choose from to fix your play style. Weapons spread from Melee, Sidearms, SMG, Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Machine Guns, Rocket Launchers, Snipers, and Flamethrowers. All weapons have durability which will degrade after every battle, but repairs are extremely cheap and can easily be covered in one game 10 times over. Note that costs will go up with weapon rarity. There are also Wrist weapons/Gear that can be equipped to deal damage over time or adding an additional defense to defend you and your team.\n\nRPG Elements: Yes, Warside has its fair share of RPG elements to add alittle bit of character customization. There is currently a limited skill tree which has passive effects for weapons and gear. These effects can add additional AoE damage to an explosive weapon, adding armor and speed bonuses, or adding duration to Poison Darts and Traps.\n\nThere is also a Player Market which functions the same as it does in most other ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes.\n\nBut in conclusion, I recommend the game to those who like RPGs and Platformers as it has a decent mix at the moment, which will without a doubt grow as the game flies through Early Access. Be sure to also make a few friends and create a private group, the one annoy quality (to me) is the very long matchmaking, which I'm sure is being worked on.\n\nEDIT: The game is not Pay to Win by any means, it's Pay for Convenience. I've personally been able to survive with two characters and limited Gear space. But  If you want to get more Gear/EXP in one mission, feel free to spend money, otherwise farm you weapons and levels (which isn't very hard.)\nYes, there are alot of bugs, but believe it or not, I've yet to come across any at all. Either Kraken Games is doing a good job or I'm just really lucky :)","May 6, 2015","true","32.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","2"

I played about five matches tonight, and all of the teams were bots except for me and one other guy. It's a really well put together, fun little game considering it's in alpha. It's very fair, to such an extent that even going against the only other human I'd seen all night, who plainly had levels on me, I was able to kill him reliably so long as I played to my class's strengths. It's definitely not pay-to-win, considering buying the game only seems to get you more experience earned.

The maps allow for multiple approches to situations.  There are 4 archetypes and 5 classes available.

As per my usual I will be rating the game on a 0 to 10 scale on multiple aspects\n\nGraphics: 9/10: For a 2d Shmup, this game looks gorgeous! For an Early Access game, it's pretty polished on graphics, though there are a few hiccups like things un-rendering when the camera gets far enough away, but that's nothing too bad.\n\nSound: ?/10: Ok, I could not with the default settings even hear the music, and sound effects, and turning everything up made the game tell me it had to restart, so I just played without the sounds, I can give a better review on them later after turning everything up. I could though faintly hear gunshot noises.\n\nGameplay: 7.5/10: Ok, so this game has no Weapon Rental gimmics, which is really nice. Everything in the Cash Shop looks to be cosmetic, which is also really nice. The gameplay itself is pretty good, there's a few things that need to be tweaked, and the developer that was online has said they are addressing things, which is amazing for a game dev!\n\n1. Collision in PvP: Currently you can collide with enemies and friendlies alike in PvP, which is very annoying for a 2d Game, if it was a 3d or even 2.5d i'd be less inclined to see this as an issue, but they are toying with making no collision.\n\n2. Friendly Fire in PvE: I didn't ask a question about this one, as I just got out of the game after doing 1 PvE mission, because I had other things to do, but Friendly Fire is Enabled in PvE and it's hella annoying.\n\n3. Gun physics: 90% of the weapons in this game drop like rocks, the only exceptions are Bolt Action Rifles, Dart Launchers, and Rocket Launchers. And that's not good.\n\nOverall: 8/10: If the sound issues were resolved, and the 3 concerns were addressed, this game would be great! If you are looking for a 2d shoot-em-up this is a great option compared to say Boring Man.","May 7, 2015","true","1.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

(You'd think 20, but 1 of the 4 classes is not available to each base character, so there are only 4x4 combinations). So, basically - 16 possible classes. That's pretty neat.\n\nThe game's concept is pretty cool.\nThere's lots of guns.\nFairly polished PVP with decent balancing from what I said.\nDecent mission-based missions...\n\n... But the gun play is literally so simple and stale that the actual gameplay is boring as HELL. It's worse than playing a tab targetting MMO when you want action combat. Most fights in PVE consist of spraying in the general direction of the target. Most fights in PVP consist of jumping around shooting randomly, unless you're using a shotgun. In which case, you literally just stand in your targets face and hope they die first.\n\nThe game would be great if the gameplay wasn't so PAINFULLY boring.\n\nIt's also not fully translated, so there are random spouts of Russian in it, and even with 16 classes, the character creation is very limited (about 4 face/hair/beard options, and you can't even choose hair color.)\n\nAll in all, I'd get the game a 4.5/10. If the gameplay gets polished (alot), this could be one of the top shooters of 2016...Notice I said 16, not 15.

The character detail is well done and there are many armor styles to choose as you progress.  Characters traits are customizable mainly by equipping items, but there is also a skills panel to develop your strengths.  Environments are interesting and detailed to the point of being immersive and not distracting.  There are plenty of weapons and other equippable items, like a med station or turret, to fit anyone's play style.  Players may find a "favorite" weapon that they always use, but some daily challenges encourage players to try other weapons, and this also helps keep the experience interesting.\n\nThere is a crafting store for each faction, though I haven't quite figured out how to make anything great.  There is no tutorial, and information in English about crafting is scarce.  As such, it's hard to comment one way or the other about this function except to say it's not explained and not intuitive.\n\nThe PVP game is a lot of fun, and you generally don't have to wait long for a match to begin.

Anything remotely resembling platforming and hazards, precise movement is a must. Even with the occasional bugs that prevent a match from even loading or beginning, or even finishing, it's still worth a shot. It is f2p. Using real money doesn't happen to be a necessity from what i was able to gather.\n\nThe thing that caused me to call it quit's for this game is just the sheer lack of content at this given moment, and the ♥♥♥♥ poor matchmaking system. You could end up spending 5-10 min on average just to get one multiplayer session started. This is because the timer resets when ever a player connects, drops, or changes their matchmaker settings. There will be times it will be at the last couple seconds before showtime, then someone just happens to do something outside of simply waiting and hitting the ready button. This screws it up for everyone whom was actually being patient.\n\nTo summarize. Fun game, as long as you play multiplayer. Goodluck with getting a match going though.\n\nEdit: So it's been about 9-10 months since i last tried this game. I was hoping at this point that there would be enough fixes and additional content to make the redownload worth while. Even better would be to have an active community. Sadly neither of these scenarios are the case. Even worse is now i get trapped at the HUB screen for an eternity once i try to access anything. A little loading dial appears on the cursor and never goes away. I figured at first this was my internet, it wasn't. Upon restarting the game, i'd get further through the menus each time till i finally got to the point of setting up a match. However, there is no one to play with.\n\nWith how slow this game is progressing in its development, if anything is being done at all, it's going to be another year till it might be in an enjoyable state. As of right now, i still can't change my recommendation.","May 10, 2015","false","5.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/recommended/320590/","MasterOfLazyness","MasterOfLazyness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/","270 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's really just a flash game remade to be 2.5 D and placed on Steam. Now that isn't entirely a bad thing but I just couldn't get past the visuals and more importantly the feel. For all the fancy movement my character (Faceless) could do it mostly seemed pointless as some enemies just wouldn't die by my weaponry, so spinning while jumping had little effect at dodging theirs. They had no healer or sheild generator but I could clearly see that they would take AGES to die. I hit them with a rocket at point-blank range and it was barely anything against them.\n\nVisually, the art work is more impressive than anything else. I see the character model and barely can make out what I'm wearing or if it's even well modeled at all. There wasn't anything visually striking or interesting about the maps. Simple standard choke points and obvious areas for team fights. Then you have the stupidly OPEN maps with all these areas to cling to and mess about with, meanwhile I just want to get to the action quickly not act like a mouse trying to get to the end of the maze for cheese.\n\nLoad times are weirdly long for what doesn't seem like a very taxing game. There are times where I felt like Far Cry 4 or Skyrim loaded faster than this thing.\n\nInstead of it being a fast paced run and gun game, it ends up being all about who can bunker down in a single area and fire the best stream of bullets in 1 direction. So PvP was a bust even if I got kills, it wasn't exactly "fun". It was just... I got some kills and suddenly the match was over.\n\nPvE was interesting but I had no idea first off how it worked. We had barriers that require something to re-power them but no details as to where I get that something. I wasn't ever able to locate the panels shown. Then enemies flooded in and end up flying up as far as they could and attacked us all day. There was one 1 tough dude that wasn't flying, everything else was. And again, it became all about staying put and firing a ton of bullets at them. Needless to say, it wasn't "fun". Certainly more engaging than PvP at times but ended up being played exactly the same way.\n\nFor a game where it's supposed to be fast paced action with quick results, it feels extremely slow as enemies end up being bullet sponges. Then there is match making. You have no idea how many times I got paired up with or against bots. It isn't very entertaining losing with bots or against them.\n\nANYWAY, I figured the real fun would come when I unlocked some skills so I tried to play that long and it just wasn't happening. I don't want to wait until level 5 to even remotely see something interesting gameplay wise.\n\nWeapons:\n-Pistols are terribad and might as well NOT be there.\n-Shotguns are only useful in PvE and might as well be ignored mostly in PvP.\n-Machine Guns are just LMG's that suck at doing anything. They say they do good damage but it doesn't feel that way.\n-"Rifles" are Snipers that... well, you don't really see people other than "Bots" using. They CAN do alright damage but they don't seem to 1shot anyone at anytime.\n-Rocket Lunchers seemed to be pretty good so long as idiot bots don't keep jumping into your shots.\n\nAs a whole the game was not entertaining... Period.\n\n","June 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Much has changed since then.\nLet's start with the minuses:\n- Chasing the elusive balance end in on "come down and so." Trying to please everyone, developer managed not to please anyone. Older players were charged armor and do not give rest to beginners? Not in this game. Power players do not have a significant advantage due to which the question arises, why equipment in the game? With such success could arrange a common arena without problems with equipment that needs to be farm weeks. But why?\n- Feedback "lame and both legs", this implies the following paragraph.\n- Hitboxes not always real and bad animations, create great combo, because of which is very hard to understand, you shoot at the enemy or through half a second he would be at the other end of the room. Do you want to be a sniper? Not in this game.\n- Rich talent tree gives some strange and useless bonuses, among which is easy to find at least some OP simply use it as a pleasant addition to the damage.\n- Stupid bots. Stupid bots were previously in PvE because of what it was boring, stupid boats appeared in PvP. If before that command can crash your game because newbies, now stupid bots. They don't know what is a tactic, rushing to break the enemy and can stuck at one point, not trying to dodge bullets. This approach has never teach beginners shot in running target and dodge enemy bullets.\n- Low Player-Online only exacerbates these shortcomings.\nOne of the advantages:\n+ Stylish si-fi 2D shooter.\n+ Tangible difference between all game characters.\n+ Sufficient for such genre, the number of classes.\n+ Ability to procrastinate stupid bots with friends\n\nTotal: 3 \ 10 stupid bots.\nAnd sry for my english.\n\n* * *\n\nК сожалению, два больших пальца вниз.\nИгра находится в "раннем доступе" около двух лет. Многое изменилось с тех пор.\nНачнем с минусов:\n- Погоня за иллюзорным балансом остановилась на "сойдёт и так". Пытаясь угодить всем, разработчик умудрился не угодить никому. Старые игроки зарядились шмотом и не дают покоя новичкам? Только не в этой игре. Заряженные игроки не имеют значительного преимущества из-за чего возникает вопрос, а зачем же экипировка в игре? С таким успехом можно было устроить обыкновенную арену, без заморочек с экипировкой, которую нужно ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ить неделями. Только зачем?\n- Фидбэк хромает а обе ноги, из этого вытекает следующий пункт.\n- Хитбоксы не всегда настоящие и игрушечная, неправдоподобная анимация создают отличное комбо, из-за которого очень тяжело понять, стреляешь ты по противнику или через пол секунды он окажется на другом конце комнаты. Вы хотите быть снайпером? Только не в этой игре.\n- Богатое дерево талантов даёт какие-то странные и бесполезные бонусы, среди которых легко найти хоть какую-то имбу и просто юзить её, как приятную добавку к урону.\n- Тупые боты. Тупые боты были ранее в PvE из-за чего оно было скучным, тупые боты появились в PvP. Если раньше твоя комманда могла слить игру из-за нубов, то теперь твоя комманда сливает из-за тупых ботов, которые не закомы с тактикой, несутся на пролом к противнику и могут завтыкать в одной точке, не пытаясь уворачиваться от пуль. Такой подход никогда не научит новичков еймингу и увороту от вражеских пуль.\n- Низкий онлайн только обостряет все эти недостатки.\nИз плюсов:\n+ Стильные si-fi 2D шутер.\n+ Ощутимам разница между всеми игровыми персонажами.\n+ Достаточное, для такого жанра, количество классов.\n+ Возможность мусолить тупых ботов с друзьями\n\nИтого: 3\10 тупых ботов.","May 25, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

Supposedly player levels scale with the battle but thats BS, have fun getting 1-2 shot by players at least six levels higher when you start. Want to do PVE? Have fun with half of your team leaving as soon as the match starts. The concept is nice, I'll give them that, kinda feels like a mix between Abuse and Awesomenauts but as it stands with the horrible lag, almost nonexistent community and ♥♥♥♥ balance I really can't recommend this game. I mean come on, how fair is it for someone to be able to stand on a capture point and take no damage because they're a higher level? Maybe if they work out some of the very blatant issues the game could be decent but with this being a russian free to play game you can't expect much from it. No, I'm not stereotyping it's just an observation, every russian game I have ever played has been a bug riddled poorly designed mess but maybe thats just me and I haven't found any of the good ones yet. As for the gameplay, you run, jump, doublejump, jetpack or hover your way around the map, movement feels nice but the animations leave a lot to be desired. When my character starts running it feels like they are going to fall over from how much they lean plus it makes all of your bullets go toward the ground no matter where you aim. Oh and speaking of aiming, it feels very bad, they have this invisible circle around your character that your mouse pointer stays in, it feels very bad for anyone that has played a 2D sidescrolling shooter as you want to put your reticle on what you're aiming at but simply can't due to the way they have it set up. Melee combat feels like you're slapping the enemy with a soggy piece of bread, there is no indication that you're even hitting your target and it feels awkward as hell. The shooting is okay but with the whole aiming issue it makes things a bit more complicated than they should be. I could keep typing for hours about all of the issues but I'd rather not. Try it yourself if you don't believe me, maybe you'll have a better experience than I.","May 13, 2015","false","1.6"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","3","11","2","3"

So... everyone you play with online is Russian. Which rapes your ping. Oh, and then you have nothing to go up against but quickscoping robots, and the tank is the only class that can withstand more than 5 seconds of fire. And the first mini-boss requires a tank to beat. And the infiltrator cannot accomplish it's advertised job, to flank and attack, because the boss will notice you, and with the aide of mandatory qu1ksk0p3rs, will wrek you.

Let's take a quick first impression review of Warside.\n\nWarside is a 2D player vs player based shooter with an RPG like progression system.  The game has a lot of customization.  You choose from one of four characters that each have different types of movement advantages and base attributes.  Then you select a class type which effects your role during matches as well as your initial loadout.  Customization only allows changing the head and facial features, you can't adjust the body at all.\n\nThe game will then run you through the tutorial level which is one of the most bland tutorials I've ever experienced.  It runs you through the basic movement, shooting, and traversal.  The game controls with WASD for movement and the mouse for aiming and shooting.  You have a jetpack for platforming and fast movement.\n\nAfter the tutorial you can jump straight into a match.  The gameplay resembles capture the flag but with multiple items to collect.  You fight on the battlefield as you bring these supplies back to your base.  Combat is hectic and clunky.  Just look at this battle here.  You have multiple players crashing into each other shooting blindly.  There is no strategy and the movement is so difficult to control.  Even platforming starts to become uncomfortable while you are trying to chase down enemies and find supplies.\n\nThe economy and microtransaction restrict from doing most things you want to do as in any free to play.  You'll have to make purchases to change your character class, appearance, or even create a second character.\n\nFurthermore I had the game crash on me several times in just a few hours of play.   I also can't hit 60 frames per second in this game even though my beast of a PC can run Dying Light on Ultra at 60 frames per second.  The interface is very unintuitive and not as responsive as it should be.  The button to start the match is this green button.  I can't even tell what that says.  I understand this game is Early Access, but this is beyond unpolished.  It's unplayable.

This game feels unfinished . A few things I noticed such as animation , collision, lack of fx and clunky controls.

Always fun when played with friends. The game suffers from one problem; small playerbase results in boring bot matches. If you have a few friends, or even just one, who you can play this game with, get the game and have fun. The level design, weapons, uppgrade system and simplistic 2D combat are very enjoyable. I personally enjoyed unlocking the special costumes by completing achievements, and im sure you and your friends will too.
