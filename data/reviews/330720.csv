This is a wonderful wego system put together by the guys at  On Target Simulations. If you enjoy 80's nato or soviet equipment and tense game play moments you can't go wrong with this game. I love the variable command cycles, get your hQ's taken out, let your troops get out of command range and you'll find your command cycle getting longer and longer. It will be that longer until you can issue orders or react to changes on the battlefield, same goes for your enemy, watch how helpful it can be to give 2 sets of orders to the enemies 1. With wonderful game play and active and responsive developers you can't go wrong with this wargame.","November 21, 2014","true","67.5"," 56 of 68 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","56","68","0","0"

This is not random and its based on lot of factors - Electronic Warfare in the area, available HQ units, C3 lines between subordinate units and their commanders and etc.\n\nScenarios scale varies from company to brigade scale operations on map sized 20x20 kilometrs divided by ~500 meters hexes.\nFC:RS modeled lot of cold war advanced weapon systems including US M1 Abrams, Bradley IFVs, UK Chieftan, Warrior IFV along with Soviet T-80s and Hinds.\nGame also features artillery weapons like mortars and SP Guns with diffirent munition like HE, Smoke, minlets and ICBM, chemical and even nuclear arms.\n\nReally worth to say that developers are working hard on game, for example Players Edition which is currently available on Steam is a result of great work between Developer team and community. Even today game continue to become better and better.\n\nHope this short list will help you to decide if this game worth your moneys.\n\nRUS:\nFlashpoint Campaigns: Red Storm это одна из тех уникальных игр, в которые я играю почти всегда, рядом с  играми серии Combat Mission, The Operational Art of War III, Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations и играми AGEod.\n\nFC:RS это микс между TOAW III и Combat Mission в сеттинге холодной войны, как раз в тот момент, когда она переста(в игре) быть такой уж холодной.\n\nИгра имеет много интересных реализаций, например наряду с огромным кол-вом военной техники игра предлагает интерсный гибридный режим WEGO(OODA Loop) тайминг ходов в котором основан на возможности стороны отдавать приказы - в результате этого бывают ситуации, когда одна сторона может отдавать приказы каждые 10 минут, а вторая каждые 20, тем самым время реакции первой стороны на ситуацию заметно меньше второй, что в свою очередь ведет, при правильном применении, к своевременной реакции на изменения на поле боя и к победе. Циклы командования не рандомны, а основаны на многих факторах, включая РЭБ, доступность штабов, существование линии командования между подчиненными и штабами и т.д.\n\nРазмеры сценариев варьируются от ротного уровня до уровня бригады на картах размером 20 на 20 км, разделенных 500 метровыми гексами.\nИгра моделирует много современных боевых систем, включая М1 Абрамс, БМП Бредли, Чифтаны, Варриоры на стороне НАТО и Т-80, Ми-24 на стороне Советов.\nТак же в игре представлены различные артиллерийские системы начиная от минометов и заканчивая самоходными гаубицами имеющие немалый арсенал боеприпасов - ОФ, дымовые, мины, кластерные, химические и даже ядерные заряды.\n\nСтоит упомянуть и то, что разработчики совсем не забыли про игру, например Player's Edition, который уже сразу доступен в стиме это результат огромной работы разработчиком вместе с комьюнити.\nИгра продолжает развиваться и совершенствоваться.\n\nНадеюсь это маленькое ревью поможет вам с выбором - стоит ли эта игра ваших денег.","June 28, 2015","true","107.5"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","38","49","4","2"

The game itself is a grand tactical/operational level war game where you take control of up to NATO brigade or Soviet Division featuring fixed wing air-support, helicopters, artillery with several forms of fire missions including counter battery fire missions, electronic warfare, tactical nukes and chemical weapons, in either H2H play (via PBEM or via the matrix H2H server) or solo play.\n\nIn solo play mode you will find the AI to be highly aggressive seeking out your weak spots and punishing any errors by exploiting gaps in your planning, if the AI detects a highly defended position it will attempt to find another route to attack down resulting in a near endless replay ability.\n\nGame play is set around a unique WEGO type of system where each side issues orders during a command phase, at which point the system will play out the action until the next command phase of either player. The command phase timings are different for each side based on several factors such as EW or suppression/destruction of C3i elements, allowing your opponent to get inside your command cycles can be deadly, likewise getting inside your enemies command cycle allows you to take the initiative often resulting in a deadly encounter.\n\nThe game engine/equipment tables take into account numerous factors with armor/penetration data for each nation, explosive reactive armor (ERA), fire control systems native to each tank, cluster munitions for both aircraft and artillery, all allowing for a viable demonstration of each sides tactics resulting in an interesting exploration of ‘the war that never happened’.\n\nModding:\nThe game devs have taken an open approach to player’s modding, allowing OOB/TOE to be modded for each nation and the floor is open to modding nations not yet represented ingame. Maps are fairly easy to produce as are images for different types of equipment fielded during the games time period. The game devs have also produced 3 guides (with a 4th due soon) explaining in clear how to mod the various aspects of the game.\n\nDev Support:\nI’ve been playing this game for nearly a year and throughout that time the game dev’s have shown  unending patience and willingness to listen to the player base for not just bug reporting (thankfully game breaking bugs are few and far between) but suggestions for new features as well as tweaking existing features. They have showed no sign of slowing down their level of outstanding support.\n","November 25, 2014","true","122.2"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

I am willing to curtail some of my negative comments, in that once you learn the nuances of the strange user interface there is a game with a great deal of depth underneath. The UI performs well in small scenarios, but on large scenarios I find it sluggish and difficult to use trying to scroll around on the map, which I still find terribly frustrating.\n\nI no longer feel robbed, but I can't say that this game will become one of my favorites.

Commands are issued at the start of each turns, and then the results play out themselves. Units also do not instantly react to your inputs either, and take time to begin doing what you order them to, and may be delayed not by just enemy action lowering their readiness levels but by roads getting clogged with traffic if you try and push too many units at once down a certain path or their commander's being too distant and the units worn down from extended battling.\n\nThe focus on regiment level command is something that could not really be replicated on tabletop in the same way, as it’s a very hands-off approach. Units, once set on their path, will use their own abilities to locate and attack enemies. What helps this is that much of the numbers are hidden (though they are viewable if you wish to check things) and so you’re not getting a face-full of dice rolls thrown up every time something happens, but rather audio cues, arrows indicating exchanges of fire, and explosions for artillery and counting off casualties, which all lends greatly to the atmosphere and sense that you are attempting to control the chaos of a battle in your favour.\n\nSpeaking of which, the atmosphere for the game is a kind of intense tension. With fog of war in place as intended (there’s an option to remove it as well as the limited orders per turn) contact with enemies is often fleeting unless a real slugging match is taking place or you've managed to secure good positioning for recon elements; an essential part of not getting surprised by a full companies of tanks and infantry barreling down a road towards you. The tension is a constant as you sit and watch a turn play out, making mental notes of enemy positions to direct artillery to and hoping your plan was good enough, or that you can adapt it in time to exploit an opening or counter a move.\n\nWhen it comes to the armies themselves you do get the best results by playing them to their general doctrine. Brits cannot (most of the time) be used in fast armoured counter attacks like the West Germans, who in turn cannot normally successfully emulate the Soviets and send massive stabbing attacks of armour and mechanized infantry, shrugging casualties to envelop and breach their target objective’s defences. Whilst many scenarios as they come feature relatively high quality Guards units of Soviets with a myriad of BMP-2s and T-80BVs in their arsenals, a huge mass of equipment sporadically appears and can be used in creating your own scenarios.\n\nOverall the game sticks well to it's intended style without getting confused or overwhelming you with mechanics, and produces some great battles and challenging campaigns.","December 5, 2014","true","37.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

They have listened to what the community has asked for and have continually improved what was already a great game.\nThe game is not for micromanagement. You do not tell units let alone individual tanks what targets to engage. You have to plan, out think your opponent and position your units where they can be successful. You have to use different tactics depending if you are playing the NATO or Soviet side. That being said you can fight small battles with just a few troops on the map to large battles with up to Brigades or a Division in size.\nThe community forums are very good and provide great support for new players learning the game.\n","November 27, 2014","true","146.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The thing to remember about this game is that just like in real life, the commander doesn't have a Gods-eye view of everything. You get contact reports as they come  in, and acting on them on any larger level takes time. A platoon of Abrams will react to Soviet armor on its own, yes, but if you want to counterattack, depending on the situation, expect it to take a bit of time to get the basic plan worked out and orders passed down to the units involved. The game invisibly abstracts all of the fog and confusion that comes with modern  warfare, frankly, I think they did a pretty darn good job. This game seems to fill a void between a division-level game like Hearts of Iron 3, and a company-level game like the Combat Mission series (not on steam, but highly reccomended.).\n\nBasically, if you want a challenging game that gives you map-on-a-table awareness on a realistic delay that can brutally punish mistakes and reward skillful planning and execution, I'd definately look into it. If you're not sure about the hex based system, get it on sale.

However, I also feel that there are a few areas of this game that feel extremely 'indie' and poorly completed, that make the game fall completely short.\n\nUI\nDoes Matrix Games have a rule for its developers that UI's need to be as bland, unhelpful, clunky, and lifeless as possible? It is the feeling I get from many of the past Matrix Games that I've played (I'm looking at you, Advanced Tactics!), and FCRS is no exception. Things just dont run smoothly within the UI, and 90% of the data that players recieve fall into two poorly sized boxes along the bottom and side of the screen. The map is also cheaply done - there is no natrual zoom for the map. More zoom does not equal more fidelity, just more pixelation. It is the same problem when players zoom out.\n\nGameplay\nThe game engine seems very primitive. Instead of seeing units seamlessly move across the screen according to march speed and formation, they simply just jump from one hex to the next. It lacks the smoothness of Panzer Corps or Order of Battle, and it looks extremely odd when you see an entire Brigade/Reigment formation on the move - each unit moving 1 hex at a time.\n\nI dont enjoy the unit management - Players are forced to direct platoon-sized units. This wouldnt be bad, but most of the pre-made scenarios/campaigns are Battalion,Brigade,Regiment and even Division sized engagements. This requires a ton of micromanagement, and when the AI has a mind of its own (units will randomly move or make decisions on their own) it can be very frustrating managing a large battle.\n\nAI\nI dont enjoy the pre-made scenarios; they're too large for my taste, and managing EVERY platoon throughout a Regiment/Brigade is time consuming and micromanaging. Most of the scenarios are meeting engagements or defensive missions. I created some small custom scenarios in the editor and realized why....the AI is really terrible at defense. On offense, the AI will not look for any advantgous terrain, and will not use any doctrine or military-technique for moving.\n\nHopefully the OTS team will develop momentum from this release, and future addons for FCRS and eventually be able to upgrade the game.","November 13, 2015","false","21.0"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","21","39","2","1"

None of that fake crap that people like to call wargames but are really wussy arcade RTS chump simulators. Flashpoint Campaigns has hexes and counters and orders and turns. All of the classic components of something designed by and for true grognards.\n\nIt is my first PC "hardcore" wargame, and after nearly a dozen hours, it's a pretty neat game. Most wargames and PC strategy games still focus around manouvre and ordering each of your units with razor-like accuracy, with each tank and squad and platoon responded to and executing your will without delay and without question. Flashpoint Campaigns isn't like that. It focuses on the hair-pulling, hypertension-inducing hell that is being helpless while you watch your men, each devoted to his nation and its cause (even if its cause is stupid) really trying their best to carry out your moronic plans only to be cut down at once by enemy fire. Confusion and lack of cohesian are the killers on this battlefield. Each turn you give orders and then click the button to play the turn out, where your guys, in accelerated time, spend the next 15 minutes to an hour on their own, trying their best to get things done. Only when the turn is up and the alotted time has passed are you allowed to give new orders and react to the situation. And the more chaotic things get and the more torn up and splintered your force gets, the longer the turn takes to playout before you can react with orders, meaning that you can end up giving orders every 40 minutes whil your opponent is able to give orders ever 15, which leads to very interesting, very asymmetrical and very unique gameplay. And if you play with the optional rule limiting the number of orders you can give per turn--something I recommend for increased realism and increased stress--things can only get more jacked up if you don't have a solid plan and the flexibility to ammend that plan when needed.\n\nThere is a lot of Cold War tech to play with, and battles move extremely fast and are extremely bloody once contact is made. The graphics are clear and attractive and have a pretty striped-down, utilitarian feel to them, which works but if someone needs to actually _see_ a tank model to have a good time playing war, you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nThe AI seems smart as hell, and you can go toe-to-toe with it across numerous individual scenarios and four separate campaigns where you keep your forces between battles. I haven't actually tried the campaigns yet, but I am excited at the prospect. I just want to hold off until I can go through a battle without getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me first.","November 28, 2014","true","43.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

My complaints about this game are all related to the gameplay mechanics and the AI. Although the graphics, the UI, and the sound effects are just mediocre, they're still acceptable to me. As a strategy fanboy, I care about gameplay and AI the most.\n\n1) The Achilles Heel of FC:RS is that it's actually a turn-based *tower defense* game, *not* a war game. It's a tower defense game because of 2 reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, you *cannot* order a combat unit to attack a specific enemy target in the game. In any tower defense game, you can only position turrets at particular locations. It's up to the turrets' AI to determine which enemies to attack. In FC:RS, the gameplay mechanics are the same. You can put combat units at strategic locations and issue different defensive orders to them (e.g., Hold, Screen, and Resupply). However, that's all you can do. It's up to the friendly AIs to determine which enemy units they want to attack. If you want your AT (Anti-Tank) unit to attack a T-80 unit, sorry, you can't. Your AT unit may decide to attack the T-80 unit. But it may also decide to attack another LAV (Light-Armored Vehicle) unit instead. You have *NO* control over which enemies your units choose to attack. It's just like a tower defense game in which combats between turrets and their enemies are 100% decided by the AIs. The only thing you can control is the positioning of your combat units. Sounds boring then, doesn't it? Yes, after 22 hours of playtime, I'm already very bored of such over-simplistic gameplay.\n\nThere's a unit command called "Assault", but it's just basically a *movement* order giving a combat unit better accuracy while it's on the move. It does *NOT* allow you to order the unit to target a specific enemy. Once the aforementioned unit reaches the final destination, it's up to the AI to determine which enemy to attack.\n\nI really wish there was an "Attack / Target" command for each combat unit in the game. Any enemy targeted by this command would be the top attack priority of my combat unit. If, for any reason (e.g., enemy having moved out of my unit's line-of-sight, or my unit's weapons unsuitable for attacking the enemy), the chosen enemy isn't a legitimate target anymore, the friendly AI will then decide which enemy should be the appropriate target. ALL of the RTS and TBS titles (from the classic Harpoon series to the recent Wargame series by Eugen Systems) have allowed the players to choose enemy targets and to formulate their own offensive strategies. Unfortunately, you can't devise your own offensive strategy in this game. Every attack move is decided by the AI. It's just 100% tower defense in nature.\n\nI don't understand...I'm supposed to play the commander's role in this game. Why ain't I allowed to order my combat units to attack specific enemy targets? This is just totally unrealistic at all.\n\nHow would you feel if Xcom didn't give you any ability to order  your troopers to target any specific alien enemy? A game with zero tactical depth and variety.\n\nThe second reason why FC:RS is a tower defense game is because the enemy AI is really stupid. They just charge at your units in a straight line without considering terrain effects and potential threats. If your unit is next to a forest and a plain tile, don't worry, the enemy AI would usually choose to move to the plain tile and attack you from there. Instead of using tanks, the AI opponent would sometimes use infantries, AAs (Anti-Air), ATs and even utility vehicles as the frontline units. This is just the same as the enemy AI in any tower defense game: advancing towards the player's turrets in a straight line without any strategy involved.\n\n2) Another shortcoming of FC:RS is the poor documentation of damage calculation. There're several types of damage in this game: AP, HEAT, Area and AD. However, neither the game manual nor the tutorial explains how damage is calculated when a unit successfully attacks / hits an enemy target. E.g., what's the formula for calculating the damage when a Challenger successfully hits a T-80? Is it [(AP+HEAT) / 2] - Armour Value? And what's the formula for calculating damage inflicted upon an infantry unit? Also, how about air units? Sorry, damage calculation is always a mystery in this game.\n\n3) My last complaint about FC:RS is that weapons' accuracy values are *NOT* displayed in-game. Yes, every weapon used by each combat unit has an accuracy value. However, when you open the unit information panels, you can never find the accuracy values. Based on the official forum's posts, you need to read a mod's guide called "The Poor Mans Mod Guide" to learn how to crack some game files in order to view the accuracy values. Seriously, why doesn't the developer just do all players a favour and have the accuracy values shown *in-game*? Without knowing the accuracy potential of my combat units, how can I formulate my assault strategy?\n\nConclusion:\n\nGame score: 6 / 10\nTo me, the severest issue of FC:RS is the lack of an "Attack / Target" command for the combat units. This basically turns this war game into a turn-based tower defense title. Players have to *blindly* follow the AI's attack decisions and this significantly undermines the tactical depth of the game. I've never written such a lengthy game review, but the gameplay mechanics of FC:RS are just very disappointing. A TBS game based on the cold war / modern warfare setting has always been my dream game. I think that's why I have so much to complain.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLastest update:\n\nDeveloper responsiveness: 10 / 10\nSeveral days after my review was posted, the developers of FC:RS provided me with some detailed updates on the changes and improvements they'll make for the next FC title (i.e., FC: Southern Storm). They actually discussed the issues mentioned in this review and they planned to implement significant changes to the next game engine (e.g., several new assault mechanics will be introduced to give players more control over their units' attack decisions). I really appreciate their responsiveness and consideration for the players. Also, they're bold enough to take constructive criticisms and think of new ideas to improve the game series further. The video game industry needs more developers like them who truly respect and listen to the players. I'd like to thank the developers Cap'n Darwin and Iron Mike Golf for taking their precious time to share their thoughts with me.\n\nPS: Please read the comment section for the developers' detailed replies and my responses. They're too long to be included in this review. If you're interested in the future development of the FC series, you shoud definitely read the developers' comments.","November 24, 2015","false","43.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","22"

But there is a lot of room for improvement.\n1.  AI seem very dumb.  If they beat me it is only because of their numbers not strategy.  Soviet force are like 5 to 1 to NATO and they just move through the main road to attack.  The soviet AI has no strategy at all.  They do hide in forest, town, and all just move down the main road.  I look like playing tower defence game than a war game.\n2.  There is not enough command varieties.  I need to control the direction of a tactical retreat.  I do not want my forces to retreat from forest to an open area (it always happen).  I want my troops to blow the bridge and move back.  Not stay on the same hex until end of my turn so I can give new command.   Just more details in unit control please.\n3.  Too many short form not explain in manual.  For example, what is RA, IL, NBC?  Can it be written in complete form so I do not need to browse the manual all the times and still cannot find it.  Or make the manual more complete.\n4.  Since there is a long delay before the troops response to my commands there is very little I can do when ♥♥♥♥ happens.  It become clear that the setup phase is over important while between turns there is not much you can do (even limit command function turn off).

Submitting orders and watching things play out is great, and the tension that builds from waiting for your next order cycle is palpable. Reading the manual, the level of detail in what is modeled and taken into account seems to be quite high, which is a good thing, though I at times I wish more information was relayed to the player (has the unit received the order? Is it still planning it's movement or is it stuck for some reason? etc).\n\nThe use of hexes and unit-level control requirements is an obvious departure from Panther's Command Ops series, which remains one of my favorites on account of its superb AI, but these differences are what makes FCRS a worthy title to enjoy alongside Command Ops because it's not trying to directly compete in the same space.\n\nI haven't tried PBEM or PBEM++ yet, but anticipate that the turn based nature of the game may make it easier to maintain an ongoing game with someone than CommOps, whose realtime pausable system means both players need to be in the hotseat at the same time.\n\nAll in all, I'm very impressed from what I've seen so far!","November 18, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game could be much more "complemented" but they decided to move on another game with some new features.... So don't waste your time.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nOverall 5/10","November 23, 2014","false","77.6"," 31 of 69 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","31","69","0","6"
