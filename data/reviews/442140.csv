"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KnightzDen/recommended/442140/","KnightzDen","Bloody John Flint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KnightzDen/","55 products in account","A quick and fun indie puzzle platformer, Dyadic brings back local co-op with it's intuitive controls and simple mechanics. There are some quirky interactions with traps and doors that I discovered by accident, but used effectively, can hinder or kill your partner. When playing this with friends the local aspect really increased the chances of messing someone up to steal back the glowing statue.\n\nThe music also provides a nice ambience and feel to the aesthetic stages which also provide information needed to solve some of the more difficult puzzles.\n\nThe game is quite short, but you can have a decent amount of replayability with new friends (because you'll know where all the traps are).\n\nOverall quite an enjoyable indie title, especially if the local co-op feel of the game appeals to you.\n\n8/10.","February 25","true","2.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"
