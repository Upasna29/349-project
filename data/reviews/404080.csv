It's highly polished, gorgeous to look at, the soundtrack is great, the voice work was serviceable, but the story felt like it was just starting right when it ended. There were no typical point and click puzzles to solve and I knew that. I knew it was going to be a short story that was told to me as I clicked on integral points in the environment to progress. I just wish that the tiny amount of story here was fleshed out a little more. I left feeling completely unsatisfied and even at this low price, I can't recommend it.","October 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 150 of 160 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","150","160","0","0"

There is the start of a potentially interesting story (trust me, it doesn't go anywhere. It's the same tired cyberpunk story you've heard about AI rights and the nature of sentience a million times before,) and then the entire second half (that is to say, the next 5 minutes) is a repeat of the same scenes as before, but with a navelgazing monologue about the relationship between player and creator.\n\nThere is simply not enough here to justify a purchase, even at the price offered here.

This isn't a game worth it's asking price. I venture to say its not an art project worth its asking price either. The "substance" of the story is a paragraph of a sci-fi *premise*. It goes nowhere. The premise alone does not make a complete narrative, and what is there isn't thought-provoking in the slightest. Maybe 30 years ago, but not today. The visuals are very nice, but don't waste your money. I make this suggestion as an avid supporter of games as art pieces; there is nothing here but atmospherics. Games, or interactive fiction, or what have you, can't survive such bad writing even with good art. There is no better example of this than this piece. It smacks of pretention that achieves nothing. I hope the artists go on to work on better projects that have actual writing in them. Maybe this dev will turn out something that is complete it its elements in the future, but this isn't it.","October 24, 2015","false","0.1"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

Even if you explore the environment for the optional stuff the games pretty much over before it even begins. There is an after credits sequence that just raises even more questions and doesnt really help anything and thats it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boomhedge/recommended/404080/","boomhedge","Seven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boomhedge/","422 products in account","This game is atrocious. The voice acting would be tolerable if the writing was able to hold it up. Unfortunately, all the player ends up with is a short (15 minutes at best) retelling of Blade Runner. The gameplay is uninspired, apparently needing a 3 minute tutorial on how to play a point-and-click game (hint; you point and click on things). The characters are either bland, or serve purely to illustrate the point of "boo humans are bad for enslaving AI".\n\nThe most ludicrous example of the terrible writing is near the end of the "game", where a robot bemoans the fact that the main character shot him, attempting to give the player some kind of guilt. EXCEPT THE ROBOT WAS POINTING A GUN AT THE MAIN CHARACTER.\n\nLiterally the only thing good about this game is the artwork, which unsurprisingly isn't done by Moorhead.\n\nAdditionally, Peter Moorhead ("developer" and auteur) is just an all-around unlikable person. He railed against the Steam refund policy, probably because of the fact that both of his "games" can be played in the time it takes to make lunch.\n\nGood thing he didn't get what he wanted, and I can still refund this tripe.","October 24, 2015","false","0.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

I love the cyberpunk theme - the I, Robot-esque machine evolution and I'm thrilled to find a new point-and-click adventure game.  I'm even willing to let the overused pixel art style slide for the sake of gameplay, but alas, this "game" fails on essentially every front.\n\nFirst off, let's not bother calling it a game.  It's really a visual novel that you can finish by clicking "critical" objects in less than 10 clicks, or you can explore every "optional" item and double the length of the experience.  You have no branching path, no deaths, no actual decision-making.  This isn't anything along the lines of King's Quest/Space Quest/Kyrandia/The Dig or anything else that is instantly identified as a point-and-click adventure.  There is no adventure here - just a few things to single-click to progress the story.\n\nRegarding the story - there's no much to it.  I could summarize it here in fewer words than I can write into a review.  If you've watched the video trailers you've already figured the story out, and you've actually seen half the dialog.  This game COULD make a good visual novel, but it's touted as being a "short story" and holy hell is that exactly what it is.\n\nI like that they went through the effort to have voice acting for all the lines (oh so many) in the game, but they used the same few actors for all the various characters.  In short, most people sound exactly the same.  It's passable, but it does detract from the limited experience a bit.\n\nIf this game was longer, like maybe even an hour and actually fleshed out its storyline, I would tell you to pay the 2.99 and enjoy the diversion.  But as it stands, it's 99 cent material, and that's possibly being generous.\n\nI was excited for this, it didn't deliver.  Motherboard had a little recommendation up for this game and that's where I learned about it, but it didn't prepare me for how short or limited it really is.  I wish it was an early access beta or something and more was to come, but this is it, and it's just not worth it.","October 24, 2015","false","0.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

That makes her afraid of any robots close to her.\n\nThis story is, sadly, everything I can tell about it; it isn't even deeper and more complex if I miss the spoiler of the ending. It doesn't have any proper conclusion that would make you feel satisfied. The story about a robot and a murder is... empty. Everything just happens without any reasoning.\n\nYou can't even fully take it as point and click adventure, you should rather think of it as a short movie with great atmosphere. But why have I given it a positive review? What excels in this game is the gorgeous pixelart graphics, nice soundtrack and well used sound effects that create the right cyberpunk atmosphere.

At that cost, this half-hour semi-interactive experience felt worth it. It's not a traditional point and clicker, although it does ape the style. There's optional and mandatory hotspots to click, but there are no puzzles, inventory, or any real interactivity whatsoever. I'm fine with that, but you may or may not be.\n\nThe story it tells is somewhat interesting, but feels underdeveloped. There's a post in the discussion forums by the developer indicating that this is the start of a larger tale, which he'd be willing to expand upon if the game in its current state sells well. Sadly, it's doubtful that we'll ever see the rest since the developer has since posted to Twitter that he's "leaving games" for a while.\n\nWhat we're left with, then, is an intriguing experience that could have been (and should have been) something much bigger and better. As I said, I enjoyed it for what it was, but YMMV. I recommend it if you can get it on sale, but pay close attention to what the negative reviews say, because their criticisms are valid.","November 25, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game would frankly have benefited from the same kind of silent storytelling that focused on interaction with the beautiful pixel environments.

In half an hour Murder packs in a ton of big ideas and folds them neatly into references to important sci fi and cyberpunk settings and characters. You'll find Stanley Kubrick and Isaac Asimov standing by PKD and Ridley Scott, while droids from Shirow Masamune's works scurry about crime scenes. Departing from Stranded's silent approach, Murder introduces a voiced cast of characters, adding a new layer to the environmental story telling. Also the soundtrack is a dead-on collection of glitched out electronic styles that successfully informs the visuals and situations.\n\nIf you are interested in concise atmospheric storytelling in a light, minimalist adventure game format this is definitely worth your time.

Regardless of where you stand however, it is most certainly a thought provoking experience unlike any other.\n\nMurder‘s protagonist, Lieutenant Motomeru Minori, is called out to a crime scene where a man has been violently killed. No biological clues or evidence has been left behind though, making it almost impossible to find the killer. Not that Motomeru’s colleagues are all that concerned, of course. This is just another day at the office for them. Another loss of life is of no real importance, so long as they can still clock out at the end of the day.\n\nMurder‘s various scenes present optional and critical scenery for you to interact with, in a point and click “look at this, now go there” style. Talking to citizens and humanoid robots reveals a world where life is cheap and disposable, possessions are of the utmost importance, and where contentedness seems forever fleeting. There are definitely parallels with today’s world.\n\n\nMoorhead’s depiction of Neo Tokyo is striking. It’s a world where human life and robots are at an intersection. For every human living life and consuming autonomously, there’s a machine reaching sentience and becoming aware of itself. Aware of its servitude to human kind. The tables have turned, and only the robots have realised The impact of this awakening has potentially far-reaching repercussions for all of mankind, yet most people are too wrapped in themselves to notice.\n\nDuring its short 20 minute run time, Murder poses numerous uncomfortable questions – many more than it has time to answer. But perhaps that’s the point?\n\nIf you enjoyed my review, why not check it out on my website?\nhttp://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/10/an-act-of-mindslaughter-murder/","October 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 26 of 76 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","26","76","0","0"

It's beautiful.\nAs a point & click adventure fan, I say it has potential.\nAs a player, I'm frustrated with it. Too short.\n\nART:\nThis game art is incredible, great perspective, great animations, great colour palette, great characters. If I had to rate this game into an ART rank it would be between GODS WILL BE WATCHING and SWORD & SORCERY, it still has a bit to evolve, but I'd give it a sweet 8/10 to it's Art & Graphics. Also, the soundtrack is awesome.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs a Point & Click adventure, this game starts really well giving the players some options to explore the rooms and interact, but as each scene passes there are fewer and fewer options, and there aren't that many scenes. Also the amount of cutscenes and the fact you can't walk around are annoying, the game should be a bit more player-driven. For Gameplay I'd say it's worth a 3/10.\n\nSTORYLINE:\nThe main problem of this game is it's length. It is waaaaaaay too short. As for a first act where you are supposed to present a bit of the world, the character, the antagonist and dive into the fantasy, this game lacks the necessary length. The plot might be very interesting or be obvious as most guessed, but we can't really tell because it ends before we can finish connect with it. And this makes me sad and angry. Such a potential wasted, I almost asked for a refund. The story might or might not have potential we can't even evaluate ??/10.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI know development is expensive, but I really think this game has invested it's resources the wrong way. I believe almost all players will complain that this game should have been longer, because by the time we are diving in it's fantasy... it ends. Also, I believe there wasn't the need for so much voice acting, foley and unnecessary animations like the elevator one. These probably wasted time and resources that could have been used for making a few more scenes and interactions so players could at least have enough game time to create a connection with the game. And since we're talking about resouces, I've seen longer and better games achieved with smaller teams. The game itself is not worth buying, but I'd recommend for those who support good and potential indie developers.","October 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 29 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","3","29","0","0"

I can see the amount of work and dedication that went into making this, between the detailed and animated pixel art along with the story writing. Unfortunately, like most other players, I was disappointed with the length and linear gameplay. I also found the voice acting to be extremely bland and void of any emotion. Though I am encouraged by the effort of adding voices, it may have been better left to text only. Additionally, the story had no clear resolution which makes me feel like I went through the entire experience for nothing. I did not get any '"why" behind what was going on and that seems like a key element in a story about murder with a grand venture buried behind it. I guess I'll never know why these events transpired and I'll just enjoy the fancy pixel art.","November 27, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the ending gives out more questions than answers, it sort of brings back the classic old-school era of computer games where you had to think up your own story. I am not saying the story is unfinished, it is just very philosophic and player is required to engage more deeply to get the full experience and derive his/hers own meaning out of it. This coupled with superb atmosphere and soundtrack makes a perfect after work experience.\nA sort of minimalistic zen game, but the superb polished details only add to the zen experience.

The entire thing is over in 22 minutes, and most of that will be watching the character walking, waiting for the elevator, or waiting for a train to arrive.\n\nThe prologue (the first ten minutes of the game) involves diving into a damaged robot's brain and setting up the second part, then the credits roll once. The credits are interrupted by waking up again and walking through the same three locations as the prologue. This time, the people are replaced with a glitchy man speaking in Matrix Architect technobabble. The experience ends by doing the exact same thing, diving into the damaged robot's brain and hearing the same lines of dialogue. The end. No closure, no development, just hints that a plot might have happened in ten minutes if the second credits roll had not interfered.\n\nThe voice acting is serviceable, the pixel art is very evocative of classic cyberpunk movies, and the ambient music fits the scenes.

It's a wonderful peice of work with a narrative that really fits in well with its cyberpunk setting.  Despite feeling like I should have been able to point-click and walk to an a spot in an area like a classical point and click adventure, the point-of-interest mechanic driving the game really does a good job of guiding the player through the narrative the author wishes to tell, but also provides sufficient non-critical interest points that add a nice touch to the overall experience of the game.","May 4","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it was quite ok, short and to the point. It doesn't claim to be more than it is, and what it is a stylized, well crafted, wafer of entertainment.","April 30","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game never claimed to be anything more, and should not be punished for its shortness. But this particular instance of a digital novella is not interesting at all—the story is neither compelling nor original, the characters are underdeveloped, and there is absolutely no sense that anything is at stake.","May 23","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
